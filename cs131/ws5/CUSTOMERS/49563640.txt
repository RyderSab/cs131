Except for a tattered shirt, he was naked. He had no shame or concern for his nakedness and had no ability to speak. He made only strange and apparently meaningless sounds and cries. While human in appearance, he lacked any qualities which otherwise would suggest that he was part of any human society. <br />The boy was captured by a villager, transported and kept for several months in an orphanage in a nearby town, and eventually transferred to Paris in June, 1800, where \\"The Wild Boy of Aveyron\\" was claimed \\"for science and humanity\\" by the newly-formed Society of Observers of Man. In Paris, the boy was given over to the Abbe Sicard, a famous educator and the head of the Institute for Deaf-Mutes. \\"Miracles were expected of Sicard, for some of his deaf-mute pupils had made a reputation by their intelligence and wit in answering written questions before large audiences.\\" Sicard, however, apparently believed that he could never train the seemingly wild creature and made no efforts to do so. Instead, he left the boy to run wild at the Institute and a commission appointed by the Society of the Observers of Man subsequently declared him to be an incurable idiot.<br />It is at this point, however, sometime in the summer or fall of 1800, that the course of the Wild Boy's life took a different course. A twenty-five year old medical student, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard began working at the Institute and became interested in the boy. More or less simultaneously with the declaration by the Society of the Observers of Man that the boy was an incurable idiot in November of that year, Itard was hired and given a room at the Institute for the sole purpose of working with the boy. Itard named the boy Victor and went on, over the course of the next six years and with the able assistance of a motherly figure by the name of MadameGuerin, to train the boy in accordance with principles Itard had derived from the writings of Locke and Condillac. These principles were intended to give the boy the ability to respond to other people, to train his senses, to extend his physical and social needs, to teach him to speak, and to teach him to think and reason logically. While Itard was never fully successful in achieving all of his objectives, his work was remarkably original and his observations and experiments have left the world with a fascinating picture of the Wild Boy of Aveyron.<br />\\"The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron\\" is a fascinating exploration of what it means to be human and how our humanity is, in a sense, created by the society in which we live, defined by our communications and relationships with others.

The three farmers are dressed in their best suits, white shirts, ties, hats, and walking sticks. They are on their way to a dance. As Powers' first person narrator writes, \\"the date sufficed to show that they were not going to their expected dance. I was not going to my expected dance. We would all be taken blindfolded into a field somewhere in this tortured century and made to dance until we'd had enough. Dance until we dropped.\\"<br />From this intriguing beginning, Richard Powers tells three stories, each of them connected through the photograph and through time. The first is that of the narrator, who stumbles upon Sander's photograph at the Detroit Institute of Arts. He becomes obsessed with the haunting aura of the photograph and spends the next several months trying to find out more about the photographer and the three men in the photograph. The second is that of the three farmers themselves-Hubert, Peter and Adolphe-and what happens to each of them when the Great War breaks out in Europe. The third story is that of Peter Mays, a writer for a computer trade magazine in 1980s Boston, who also becomes obsessed-not with the photograph, but with a beautiful red haired woman dressed in early twentieth century period costume that he sees on the street following a Veterans' Day Parade-and ultimately finds out that he has a connection to one of the men in the picture and to the events of the Great War.<br />To say that \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\" tells three stories is misleading, however, insofar as the novel is dominated not by plot, but, rather, by a range of discursive narratives on how the world has changed between the Great War, when Sander's photograph was taken, and the present day. Plot does not drive the action of Powers' densely intellectual novel; rather, it provides a touchstone for the narrator to explore certain events and fundamental ideas of the Twentieth Century. For example, when the office cleaning woman shows the narrator artifacts from the Great War, it strikes an intellectual cord that leads to a long discourse on Charles Peguy, the French thinker who, in 1913, made the subsequently oft-quoted remark that \\"the world had changed less since the death of Jesus than it had in the last thirty years,\\" and the ideas \\"hidden\\" in Peguy's formulation. Similarly, the narrator's obsessive study of the 1914 photograph leads to an historical investigation of Sander's life and works. It also leads to speculations on the nature of photography and on how photography changed conceptions of art that derive closely from Walter Benjamin's classic essay, \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\\" <br />Ideas and intellectual referents are ubiquitous in this novel; simply read the epigraphs to each chapter to get a feel for the intellectual gyroscope that orients \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\". It is a remarkable work that demands a great deal from the reader. It is also a work that will disappoint anyone who is looking for a straightforward plot or a mere \\"page turner.\\"<br />If you're interested in ideas, in novels with intellectual density, in narratives that force you to think deeply and reflectively about the world, \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\" is the perfect novel. Read it, enjoy it, and move on to the rest of Richard Powers' remarkable list of fictions.	2002-07-26

These are stories from Chekhov's so-called \\"middle period,\\" the years after Chekhov had finished his medical studies and began writing and publishing the longer, more serious psychological studies whose characteristics became a universal ascription for short stories of that sort: \\"Chekhovian.\\" As Harold Bloom has written, \\"the formal delicacy and somber reflectiveness [of Chekhov's stories] make him the indispensable artist of the unlived life, and the major influence upon all story-writers after him.\\"<br />Every one of the stories in this volume is a remarkable example of Chekhov's ability to write in simple, straightforward fashion, while, all the time, illuminating with almost microscopic precision the internalized, psychological lives of his characters. As one commentary on Chehov's writing during this period has noted, apropos of the stories in this volume (and in contrast to Chekhov's early humorous stories): \\"Characters are no longer perceived satirically, as social archetypes, but seen from within. And the inner life revealed is often an unhappy one, the characters' 'real life' being in sharp contrast with their 'world of desire,' reached only through memory or fantasy.\\"<br />The stories range from long to short, each a near-perfect model of the short story, worthy of enjoyment and careful study. The longest of the stories, \\"A Woman's Kingdom,\\" tells of Anna Akimovna, the daughter of a factory owner who, as a young girl, mingled with the working classes, only to find herself the lonely, single, middle-aged heiress and proprietor of those same factories later in life. It is a remarkable exploration of Anna's loneliness and of her yearning to return to the life of her childhood, as well as of the separation between owner and worker in an industrialized Russia. As Anna says, longingly: \\"Yes, I'll go andget married. I will marry in the simplest, most ordinary way and be radiant with happiness. And, would you believe it, I will marry some plain working man, some mechanic or draughtsman.\\"<br />In the title story, \\"The Party,\\" Chekhov brilliantly probes the mind, the thoughts, the silent unhappiness and dissatisfaction of Olga Mihalovna, a pregnant, married woman who clearly does not like her philandering, brash husband or her social obligations. In a passage that strikingly illustrates both the luster of Chekhov's art and the deep-seated discontent of the character of his story, Olga stands watching her guests, the partygoers of the story's title, glide by in boats:<br />\\"Olga Mihalovna looked at the other boats, and there, too, she saw only uninteresting, queer creatures, affected or stupid people. She thought of all the people she knew in the district, and could not remember one person of whom one could say or think anything good. They all seemed to her mediocre, insipid, unintelligent, narrow, false, heartless; they all said what they did not think, and did what they did not want to. Dreariness and despair were stifling her; she longed to leave off smiling, to leap up and cry out, 'I am sick of you,' and then jump out and swim to the bank.\\" <br />These are just two of the stories. The volume also contains \\"The Kiss,\\" a story that no less a literary arbiter than Bloom considers the best of Chekhov's early stories (written in 1887, when Chekhov was 27 years old). And the rest are equally good, demonstrating why Chekhov is considered among the greatest practitioners of the story-writer's art. <br />If you can, find this volume and the others in The Ecco Press's wonderful edition of Chekhov and read them all. If you can't, then find another edition. Just read Chekhov. You will not be disappointed.	2002-07-23

At Least Until Marcel	Let's begin with Nabokov's \\"Lectures on Literature,\\" where he introduces \\"Madame Bovary\\" as follows: \\"The book is concerned with adultery and contains situations and allusions that shocked the prudish philistine government of Napoleon III. Indeed, the novel was actually tried in a court of justice for obscenity. Just imagine that. As if the work of an artist could ever be obscene.\\" Written over a five-year period, \\"Madame Bovary\\" was published serially in a magazine in 1856 where, despite editorial attempts to purge it of offensive material, it was cited for \\"offenses against morality and religion.\\" Fortunately, Flaubert won his case and \\"Madame Bovary\\" remains to this day one of the masterpieces of French and world literature. Indeed, in Nabokov's view, the novel's influence is notable: \\"Without Flaubert, there would have been no Marcel Proust in France, no James Joyce in Ireland. Chekhov in Russia would not have been quite Chekhov.\\"<br />The story of Emma Bovary is well known and uncomplicated. Set in the provincial towns of Tostes and Yonville (it is subtitled \\"Patterns of Provincial Life\\"), with adulterous interludes in Rouen, \\"Madame Bovary\\" narrates the life of Charles Bovary and Emma Rouault. Charles, an \\"officier de sante\\"--a licensed medical practitioner without a medical degree--meets Emma while tending to her injured father. Charles is married at that time to the first Madame Bovary, also called Madame Dubuc, a widow and thin, ugly woman who dominates the mild-mannered Charles from the very beginning. \\"It was his wife [Madame Dubuc] who ruled: in front of company he had to say certain things and not others, he had to eat fish on Friday, dress the way she wanted, obey her when she ordered him to dun nonpaying patients. She opened his mail, watched his every move, and listened through the thinness of the wall when there were women in his office.\\"<br />When Madame Dubuc dies a few short years after their marriage, it appears that Charles is fortunate, for he is not only freed from the shrewish oppression of his wife, but enabled to court and marry the beautiful Emma. It is the eight-year marriage of Charles and Emma that embodies the tale of \\"Madame Bovary,\\" a tale marked by Emma's ennui, her dissatisfaction with the unsatisfied yearnings of bourgeois marriage in a small provincial town, her steadily growing sensual insatiability, her adulteries with a series of men. It is this marriage, too, that gives us one of literature's great cuckolds, Charles Bovary.<br />\\"Madame Bovary\\" has often been described as a realistic novel and, insofar as it tells a seemingly ordinary tale of sensual longing and adultery while, at the same, time depicting characters and sensibilities typical of bourgeois, philistine rural France during the reign of Louis Phillipe, it is grimly realistic. It is also, however, a deeply psychological novel, one in which Flaubert brilliantly probes the feelings, the sensations, the romantic longings and dreamscapes of Emma Bovary. Above all, \\"Madame Bovary\\" is the apogee of the French novel prior to Proust's Parnassian achievement, a novel whose poetic language and artistic rendering transcend mere narrative and elevate Flaubert's work to that of high literary art, a novel for the ages.

He ultimately produced nine brilliant volumes which still stand as the finest and most complete summary of Western philosophy from the earliest Pre-Socratics to modern Existentialists and Structuralists (the last of the volumes covering Sartre, Camus and Levi-Strauss, among others). <br />The first volume, which covers the conception of Western philosophy in the seed of the early Ionian thinkers, through the gestation of Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Zeno, Anaxagoras, and the Sophists, ultimately culminating in the birth of Western philosophy in the axis of Socrates-Plato-Aristotle and its post-Aristotelian Roman afterbirth, is a detailed and analytical discussion of the origins of Western thought. Complete in itself, it provides a comprehensive introduction to the beginnings of Western rationalism and a useful starting point for a general study of the history of philosophy in the West or a more detailed exploration of the ancient thinkers from the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus. <br />If any criticism can be made of Copleston's work, it is that his analyses are dominated by an overriding scholasticism, by Copleston's adherence to traditional, Thomist perspectives on these thinkers. This criticism is difficult to make, however, because he never minces words in disclosing his point of view and because, despite his own Jesuitical intellectual predilections, his treatment is always comprehensive, thoughtful and genuine.	2002-05-11

It struck me then, as it strikes me now upon re-reading it, as one of the most peculiarly funny books I've ever read. It combines elements of original lunacy and weird science with the resonating touchstones of a uniquely Irish comic sensibility. The story is driven by the madcap schemes of a character named De Selby, who describes himself as &quot;a theologist and a physicist, sciences which embrace many others such as eschatology and astrognosy.&quot; De Selby invents a substance which removes all oxygen from the atmosphere (a substance he calls &quot;DMP&quot;, the acronym for the Dublin Metropolitan Police) and then discovers that a deoxygenated atmosphere cancels the serial nature of time. The plot moves on from there, with Mick Shaughnessy, a &quot;lowly civil servant&quot;, engaging the local constable to help him save the world from De Selby's scheme to deoxygentate the world's atmosphere. In the course of things, &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; contains two of the funniest chapters ever written (Chapters 4 and 9): one in which De Selby, Mick Shaughnessy and a drinking companion named Hackett, clad in aqualungs, talk to Saint Augustine (his &quot;Dublin accent was unmistakable&quot;) about arcane theological doctrines and the Church Fathers in an underwater cave; the other in which Sergeant Fottrell, the constable, explains to Mick his &quot;Mollycule Theory&quot;, the theory that people's personalities become mixed up with those of bicycles through the pounding of man and machine while pedaling down bumpy Irish country roads (&quot;a process of prolonged carnal intercussion&quot;). Along the way, Mick discovers that James Joyce is alive, well and bartending in the small coastal town of Skerries. Need I say more? &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; is a work of startling wit and originality, one of my comic favorites!	2002-05-08

While less well know in the United States than some of his Italian contemporaries-I think here of Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Umberto Eco-Sciascia enjoys a well deserved reputation in Italy as a writer of novels, stories and political commentary.<br />Sciascia was a Sicilian. This fact, more than any other, colors all of the stories in this collection. Each of these stories reflects, in some way, the particularities of Sicilian culture and society. There is, of course, the uneasy and often conflicting relationship that Sicily has had with the rest of Italy, particularly the northern part of that country. There is also the pervasive influence of the Mafia on Sicilian life, particularly the strong notions of honor and \\"omerta,\\" the Mafia code of silence. And there is, finally, the interplay of the tightly knit Sicilian family, the Roman Catholic Church and the Italian state. <br />The best of the stories in this collection are marked by subdued irony, subtle wit and steely-clear insight into the idiosyncrasies that mark Sicilian life within the larger context of Italy. <br />In \\"A Matter of Conscience,\\" a Sicilian lawyer traveling back home from Rome picks up a women's magazine on the train. He reads an anonymous letter to a priest, written by a woman from his hometown, asking for advice. The woman had an affair with a relative for six months, is tormented by her adultery and wants to know whether she should tell her husband. She relates that, \\"as a very devout person, I have confessed my fault on several different occasions.\\" She then goes on-drawing the distinction between her Sicilian mores and those of the rest of Italy-as follows: \\"Every priest except one (but he was a northerner) has told me that if my repentance is sincere, and my love for my husband unchanged, then I must remain silent.\\" From here, the story turns into a witty, ironic exploration of lifein the lawyer's town as each of his colleagues becomes obsessed with the thought that he is the cuckold.<br />In \\"Mafia Western,\\" a big town \\"on the border between the provinces of Palermo and Trapani\\" is embroiled in a bloody battle between two feuding mafia cells. It is at the time of World War I and, \\"the death-toll from assassination [is] comparable to the death-toll of its citizens falling at the front.\\" In dry, matter-of-fact style, Sciascia relates this fictional tale, the interstices of his story relating the society within the society-the society of the mafiosi, the capo and the code of silence. Thus, a mother's son is killed and she knows his assassin. But she remains silent, picking up her son's body and bringing it back home. \\"The next morning she let it be know that her son died of a wound there upon his bed, but she knew neither where nor by whom he had been wounded. No word did she utter to the carabinieri about the man who might have killed him. But her friends understood-they knew-and they now set about very careful preparations.\\"<br />In \\"Philology,\\" two men that are to be called before the Commission of Enquiry investigating the activities of the mafia in Sicily engage in an ironic, witty discourse on the origin and meaning of the word \\"mafia\\". They are doing this in preparation for their interrogation, their dialogue a bit of dry, absurd humor that conflates the high intellectual pretension of philological discourse with the pragmatic, cold-blooded realities that underlie their preparations. As one of them says, \\"the fact is that everyone tries to establish the current meaning of the word before establishing its origin.\\" After exploring possible Arabic and French origins of the word, and the deficiencies in education of the general public, who misunderstand the importance of etymology and meaning, he ultimately presents an ironically pragmatic, if high-sounding, statement of the meaning of the word \\"mafia\\": \\"Mafia implies a consciousness of self,an exaggerated concept of the power of the individual as sole arbiter of every conflict of interests or ideas; from this derives the inability to bear with the superiority, and even more, the authority of others. The mafioso expects respect and nearly always offers it. When crossed, he does not appeal to the law, public justice, but takes matters into his own hands and, should the remedy be beyond his own power, he will call on the assistance of like-minded friends.\\"<br />\\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" the longest of the stories in this collection, wonderfully depicts the cultural separation between Sicilians and other Italians. In this story, Bianchi, an engineer traveling to Sicily for the first time, shares a compartment with a Sicilian family and \\"a girl of about twenty-three\\" who is attached to the family \\"by ties of family, friendship or casual acquaintance.\\" Over the course of their long train ride, Bianchi, if only briefly, manages to penetrate the seemingly deep cultural divide between him and the family, along the way also sharing a fleeting romantic connection with the young girl.<br />These are only some of the stories in this collection. There are others that are equally good. In particular, I think of \\"Demotion\\" (which provides a fascinating contrapuntal theme of Catholicism and Communism, Saint Filomena and Joseph Stalin) and \\"The Ransom\\" (which retells a popular Sicilian folk tale of familial duty, love and betrayal). With the exception of \\"Apocryphal Correspondence re Crowley,\\" which, at best, is of nothing more than historical interest and utterly unremarkable, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea\\" is an exceptionally good collection of stories and a wonderful introduction to an Italian writer that, thus far, has been little read in the United States.	2002-05-07

So much for the erstwhile judgment of the publishing establishment, for this novel is a near perfect work of fiction that can rightfully be considered one of the finest American novels of this century.<br />\\"Desperate Characters\\" tells the story of Otto and Sophie Bentwood, a childless couple in their 40s (\\"Sophie was two months older than Otto\\") living in a fashionably renovated Brooklyn brownstone circa 1970. They have a high income and can purchase \\"pretty much\\" whatever they want. Their bookcase holds the complete works of Goethe and two shelves of French poets. They have a Mercedes-Benz sedan and a Victorian farmhouse on Long Island. Otto is a lawyer and Sophie a translator. They are, by all outward appearances, living the perfect life. It is the genius of Paula Fox to lay bare the underlying disturbances, the morbid self-consciousness and despair, the ennui, that undermines this seemingly ordered world. \\"Desperate Characters\\", a short novel set over a few days, is literary dissection of the highest order, a tightly written masterpiece that leaves the reader uneasy and disturbed.<br />Things begin to unravel early in the story. Sophie, feeding a stray cat, is bitten. Life no longer seems so perfect now, the fear of rabies intruding. When they leave the security of their brownstone, they find \\"refuse everywhere, a tide that rose but barely ebbed.\\" There were \\"beer bottles, beer cans, liquor bottles, candy wrappers, crushed cigarette packs, caved-in boxes that held detergents, rags, newspapers, curlers, string, plastic bottles, a shoe here and there, dog feces.\\" The world outside is disorderly, threatening, rabid.<br />Anomie and uncertainty seem now to press everywhere. A rock is thrown through a friend's window during a party. Otto's law firm partnership is breaking up. Sophie drifts off inexplicably with Otto's law partner to walk the streets in the middle of the night. The quiet emotional estrangement of Otto and Sophie becomes apparent from a simple thing like Otto's refusal to answer the telephone \\"because I never hear anything I want to hear any more\\". Thus, they stand facing each other \\"rigidly, each half-consciously amassing evidence against the other, charges that would counterbalance the exasperation that neither could fathom.\\" <br />Sophie no longer has any interest in her work as a translator and can think, instead, only of the unsatisfying affair she had several years earlier. Sitting in their living room, Otto and Sophie's tense, uneasy conversation is interrupted by the doorbell, a black man asking to come into their house and use their phone. \\"Robbery and murder appeared before [Sophie] in two short scenes, clicked on and off like pictures projected on a screen.\\" The outside world can intrude at any moment. \\"Life is desperate,\\" as Sophie says. When they seek an escape for a day to their home on Long Island, they find it ransacked and vandalized. And all the time there looms the fear that the cat was rabid. As Sophie, alone, says aloud to herself, \\"God, if I am rabid, I am equal to what is outside.\\" <br />\\"Desperate Characters\\" draws its title from Thoreau's oft-quoted line about the quiet desperation of most men's lives. In a little over 150 pages, Paula Fox has written a near masterpiece of Otto and Sophie Bentwood's fictional lives, of the desperation of their lives, of the desperation of living in a world without certainty and order when certainty and order are all that you live for.	2002-05-06

That novel told the simple story of an adolescent French girl living in Vietnam in the 1930s. She meets an older Chinese man who becomes her lover. It is a sparely written novel, shifting in time and narrative perspective, often difficult to follow. It is also a novel charged with memory, yearning and erotic feeling. <br />\\"The North China Lover\\", written several years later and published in an English edition in 1992, is a kind of extension of the earlier novel, written with much more detail, inhabiting the interstices of \\"The Lover\\". Like its precursor, \\"The North China Lover\\" tells a powerful tale of love between the twenty-seven year old Chinese man and the barely teen-aged girl whom he meets on a ferry crossing the Mekong River. Once again, neither the Chinese man nor the girl has a name. However, unlike the earlier novel, many of the other characters are identified and the narrative of \\"The North China Lover\\" is considerably more detailed. Originally written as notes for a screenplay of \\"The Lover\\", the narrative of \\"The North China Lover\\" is episodic, described by one reviewer as having the \\"grainy, filmic qualities of a documentary.\\" It is also more linear in its story line, easier to follow than the earlier novel, but still characterized by the nouveau roman influences that permeate Marguerite Duras' writing.<br />\\"The North China Lover\\", like its precursor, is a compelling work of memory, eroticism and yearning that, in true Duras style, conflates literary imagination and biography. Read it slowly, languorously savor its eroticism, and let it linger in your mind long after you've closed the book.	2002-05-02

This perception became the basis for &quot;Exercises in Style&quot;, a literary experiment which stunningly challenges the notion of realism.<br />Queneau was a polymath, with interests and accomplishments as a novelist, poet, linguist and mathematician. Briefly a member of Andre Breton's Surrealist group, Queneau subsequently joined the &quot;College of Pataphysics&quot; in 1950. Pataphysics was the science of imagainary solutions, a science which originated with the poet and playwrite Alfred Jarry. The Pataphysicians were a tongue-in-cheek group of French intellectuals who didn't take themselves too seriously. At the same time, Queneau was exploring the Pataphysical, however, he was also serving as Director of the prestigious &quot;Encyclopedie de la Pleiade&quot;, thus combining the whimsical with the serious. A decade later, Queneau was a founder of &quot;OuLiPo&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Ouvroir de Litterature Poetentielle&quot; or &quot;Workshop for Potential Literature&quot;). In contrast to the Dadaist and Surrealist movements, which gave free reign to chance and the unmediated workings of the unconscious, OuLiPo emphasized the systematic and deliberate generation of texts.<br />&quot;Exercises in Style&quot; is based upon an uninteresting and simple story, a story without any plot, a story that in itself is pointless and boring. Queneau tells this story ninety-nine times, each time using a different variation in the telling. Barbara Wright, the translator of the English edition, notes in her introduction that the variations fall into roughly seven categories. These categories include different types of speech, different types of written prose, different poetic styles, and different grammatical and rhetorical forms. Another category are variations which are told in the form of character sketches through language (e.g., reactionary, biased, abusive, etc.). Queneau, in this fashion, demonstrates the fluidity of language, the variability in the ways that language can describe reality. As one critic succinctly and correctly stated, &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; demonstrates &quot;the impossibility of realism in any unitary sense.&quot;<br />Queneau wanted &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; translated into English and, unike most literary texts, this particular text loses little in translation. While Barbara Wright's translation is outstanding, she also rightly notes that &quot;the story as such doesn't matter, [nor] does the particular language [in which] it is written.&quot; What matters, and what &quot;Exercises in Style&quot; brilliantly illustrates, is that a simple story can be expressed in an infinite variety of literary and linguistic styles, that the transformation of reality into language is susceptible of manifold permutations. This is the genius of Queneau's text, a genius which makes this book a minor classic of modern literature.	2002-04-29

Connell's &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot; is one of the truly outstanding works of Twentieth century American literature, a restrained, yet brilliantly wrought fictional portrait of upper middle class married life in the decades surrounding World War II. Connell tells the story of India Bridge in 117 short chapters, each a spare vignette of her enervated life in the perfectly manicured &quot;country-club district&quot; of an affluent Kansas City suburb. Linear in its narrative and meticulously realistic in its style, &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot; follows India's life from marriage, to the birth of three children, to the rejection by those children of the repressed life of their parents as they grow into adults, to lonely suburban widowhood. While it is, at its heart, a grim tale of one woman's life of repression and, ultimately, loneliness and resignation, Connell's flawless and restrained narrative ultimately leaves the reader feeling exhilarated at the sheer literary achievement of &quot;Mrs. Bridge&quot;.<br />Ostensibly the story of a marriage, Mr. Bridge is noticeably absent from much of the narrative. A successful lawyer, he is a man who is unable to express love or affection for his wife or his children, a man who is focussed on becoming &quot;rich and successful,&quot; the epitome of the status-conscious husband and father whose identity lies in material possessions. &quot;The family saw very little of him. It was not unusual for an entire week to pass without any of the children seeing him. On Sunday morning they would come downstairs and he . . . greeted them pleasantly and they responded deferentially, and a little wistfully because they missed him. Sensing this, he would redouble his efforts at the office in order to give them everything they wanted.&quot;<br />Mrs. Bridge, too, is powerfully repressed, unable to articulate her feelings of dissatisfaction, a woman who is beholden to the expectations of respectability and obsessed with appearances. &quot;She brought up her children very much as she herself had been brought up, and she hoped that when they were spoken of it would be in connection with their nice manners, their pleasant dispositions, and their cleanliness, for these were qualities she valued above all others.&quot; Thus, she ultimately drives all three of her children from her life, her unthinking obeisance to social convention destroying any thread of relationship that she might have had with them. Her oldest daughter, &quot;curiously dark&quot;, flees to New York City, where she pursues her more unconventional dreams. Her second daughter, an accomplished golfer, enters an ill-fated marriage with a college dropout who cannot provide the country club life that she has been weaned to expect. Her son joins the army, asserting an act of individuality that Mrs. Bridge never seems able to accept or reconcile.<br />It is, most notably, however, in her relationships with her peers-with the other affluent housewives of the &quot;country-club district&quot;-that the grim and vapid nature of Mrs. Bridge's life becomes most apparent. In particular, her friend Grace Barron becomes a kind of outward manifestation of India Bridge's discontent, someone who lives a life of equal desperation, but not so quietly as Mrs. Bridge. Grace Barron &quot;was a puzzle and was disturbing&quot; to Mrs. Bridge. Why? Because she actually questioned the life she led, moving outside the banal, the conventional, if only in her discourse. As Grace once said to Mrs. Bridge: &quot;India, I've never been anywhere or done anything or seen anything. I don't know how other people live, or think, even how they believe. Are we right? Do we believe the right things?&quot;<br />Unlike Mrs. Bridge, who talked of &quot;antique silver, Royal Doulton, Wedgwood, the price of margarine as compared to butter, or what the hemline was expected to do,&quot; Grace Barron talked of &quot;art, politics, astronomy, literature.&quot; Ultimately, Grace cannot cope with the ennui, the claustrophobia of her life, and she does what Mrs. Bridge ultimately lacks the fortitude to do; in a sense, Grace is a sort of &quot;double&quot; who acts out the dark alternative to Mrs. Bridge's repression. And when Grace does act, all that comes to Mrs. Bridge's mind is something Grace once said to her: &quot;Have you ever felt like those people in the Grimm fairy tale-the ones who were all hollowed out in the back?&quot;	2002-04-29

Connell's \\"Mr. Bridge\\" stands, together with its companion novel, \\"Mrs. Bridge\\", as one of the outstanding works of Twentieth century American fiction. The two works, taken together, form the brilliantly wrought portrait of an upper middle class marriage in the years preceding and encompassing World War II. Linear in its narrative and meticulously realistic in its style, \\"Mr. Bridge\\" tells the story of Walter Bridge, a financially successful, but emotionally stunted, lawyer who lives out his proper married life in the wealthy Mission Hills suburb of Kansas City. <br />Mr. Bridge recognizes that his life did not begin until he knew his wife, India Bridge. His marriage is, in this sense, important to him. But he cannot articulate his deep feelings for his wife and, ultimately, gives up trying to express any emotion at all. \\"So the years passed, they had three children and accustomed themselves to a life together, and eventually Mr. Bridge decided that his wife should expect nothing more of him. After all, he was an attorney rather than a poet; he could never pretend to be what he was not.\\"<br />Cold and emotionally repressed, Mr. Bridge spends all of his time at the office, becoming involved with his family only when necessary to ensure that proper middle class respectability is maintained. He spends his time visiting the bank, scrutinizing his stock certificates and counting his profits. Indeed, he is so focussed on wealth that he surprises his wife and children with stock certificates of Kansas City Power & Light on Christmas morning, only to take the gifts back into his possession so that he can properly manage them. <br />Manipulative and controlling, Mr. Bridge persuades his reluctant daughter, after she has won a contest, to accept a pony as a prize, even though she would much rather have a bicycle. When the day comes to accept the prize, \\"Mr. Bridge could not attend the presentation ceremony because he was again spending Saturday at the office.\\" Like his self-centered Christmas present of utility company stock, this prize, too, becomes cheerless for his daughter because of his need to impose his will.<br />Deeply bigoted, Mr. Bridge cannot tolerate Jews or Blacks very well. When he has an opportunity to take investment advice from an obviously successful Jewish stockbroker, Mr. Bridge, instead, becomes offended by the man's ethnicity and ostensible pretension to be a successful upper middle class man like himself. Reluctantly shaking the man's hand, Mr. Bridge \\"could hardly restrain a shudder.\\" Resonating with antisemitic feeling, \\"he withdrew his hand, which came away stickily. He wanted to wash it. His hand felt moist and unhealthy, as if during those few seconds it had become infected.\\" Similarly, when his wife shows him horrifying pictures of a brutal lynching in the South, his only reaction is to ask, \\"what was this fellow doing that he shouldn't have been doing?\\"<br />A fiercely conservative man, with political views as deeply repressive as his stunted emotions, he cannot tolerate President Roosevelt. He even suggests that while Hitler was insane, \\"some of his ideas were sensible.\\" <br />Indeed, the repressed feelings of Mr. Bridge find their darkest allusions in his feelings about his daughters, feelings that suggest powerful undercurrents of the sexuality that is absent from his marriage. Seeing his grown daughter, Carolyn, one night posing naked in front of a mirror, he cannot get her out of his mind. \\"He reminded himself that she was his daughter, but the luminous image returned like the memory of a dream.\\"<br />\\"Mr. Bridge\\", like its companion novel, \\"Mrs. Bridge\\", is a stunning work of realism, a crystalline pure narrative of a marriage without feeling, a life without love, a man without the ability to move outside the bounds of middle class probity and respectability.	2002-04-29
US	49563640	R1CWJEORGKKQP	0940322218	380608340	Jakob von Gunten (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	An Eccentric, Kafkaesque Novel Written Before Kafka	In 1910, Franz Kafka began writing his journals. This was one year after the publication in Germany of Robert Walser's eccentric little novel, \\"Jakob von Gunten\\". The fact is worth noting because Kafka had read Walser and liked his writing, writing which can be characterized as \\"Kafkaesque\\" even though it preceded the publication of Kafka's work by several years. The resemblances between Walser and Kafka-- in sensibility, in prose style, in eccentricity of thought and syntax--are remarkable. <br />\\"Jakob von Gunten\\" is the first person journal of a student at the Benjamenta Institute, a school for butlers in an unidentified city. In young Jakob's words, \\"one learns very little here, there is a shortage of teachers, and none of us boys of the Benjamenta Institute will come to anything, that is we shall all be something very small and subordinate later in life.\\" <br />The Institute is run by Herr Benjamenta and all classes are taught by his sister, Fraulein Lisa Benajamenta. There are no other teachers, all of the others being either \\"asleep, or they are dead, or seemingly dead, or they are fossilized.\\" It is a narrowly circumscribed world full of students who are enchanted with the most mundane and trivial matters. But it is also a mysterious world, a world alienated from reality, a dreamlike projection of Jakob's mind expressed in the concrete language of the real. \\"The Benjamentas are secluded in the inner chambers and in the classroom there's an emptiness, an emptiness that almost sickens one.\\" <br />Humorous and absurd, disturbing and, at times, childlike in its simplicity, \\"Jakob von Gunten\\" is the work of an undeservedly obscure master of modern prose. Thus, Christopher Middleton, the translator, in his fascinating and useful introduction, describes Walser as \\"in significant ways untutored, something of a primitive.\\" More precisely, Middleton notes that Walser's prose \\"can display the essential luminous naivete of an artist who creates as if self-reflection were not a barred door but a bridge of light to the real.\\" It is, in other words, prose which seeks to rewrite the \\"real\\" in the distorted image of the narrator's mind, making simple descriptions of mundane experience absurd. It is Kafkaesque writing before the advent of Kafka, a diminutive precursor of the Master of Prague.	2002-04-29

Port and Kit Moresby, husband and wife, and their friend, Tunner, are &quot;travelers,&quot; not &quot;tourists,&quot; as Port says early in the narrative. &quot;The difference is partly one of time . . . Whereas the tourist generally hurries back home at the end of a few weeks or months, the traveler, belonging no more to one place than to the next, moves slowly, over periods of years, from one part of the earth to another.&quot; Like travelers, Port, Kit and Tunner seem to have little in the way of an itinerary, their days languourously slipping by, one day into the next, without purpose, marked only by a palpable psychic discomfort. <br />But there is another important difference between the tourist and the traveler. As Port relates, &quot;the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking.&quot; In doing this, however, the traveler runs the risk, if the degree of cultural separation is too great, if the foreign culture is too extreme, that he will become completely untethered from reality. As Bowles once said in a 1981 Paris Review interview: &quot;Everyone is isolated from everyone else. The concept of society is like a cushion to protect us from the knowledge of that isolation. A fiction that serves as an anaesthetic.&quot; <br />It is, ultimately, the removal of this anaesthetic, the removal of societal and cultural moorings, which drives the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;and determines the fate of Port and Kit and Tunner. One does not survive; another will never be the same again. Disturbances of the interior landscape, the landscape of the psyche, become the catalyst of this psychologically discomforting novel. And this stunning mingling of interior landscape with the landscape of the Sahara-the sands, the sky, the maze-like passages of the cities, the alien culture-brilliantly unfies and completes the narrative of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, marking it as a profound and compelling work of genius.	2002-04-29

And Then Read Again	Walker Percy was forty-six years old when his first published novel, \\"The Moviegoer,\\" was awarded the National Book Award in 1962. It was, in some sense, the public beginning of the second half of Percy's life for, as Percy himself wrote in 1972: \\"Life is much stranger than art-and often more geometrical. My life breaks exactly in half: 1st half=growing up Southern and medical; 2nd half=imposing art on 1st half.\\" But what, exactly, did Percy mean when he said this? In some sense, \\"The Moviegoer\\" is the beginning of an answer.<br />Percy was born in 1915 and lived his early life in Birmingham, Alabama. His grandfather committed suicide when Walker was an infant and his father, too, committed suicide in 1929. Following his father's suicide, his mother moved Walker and his two brothers to Mississippi. Percy's family was one of the oldest families in the South and he and his brothers soon found a father figure in the form of his cousin, William Alexander Percy, known affectionately as Uncle Will. Three years after his father's suicide, Percy's life was again marked by tragedy when his mother's car went off a bridge, killing her and leaving Walker and his brothers in the charge of his Uncle Will. <br />Percy went to medical school at Columbia University, where he contracted tuberculosis during his internship. In and out of sanitariums for several years, he finally returned to the South in his early 30s, getting married in 1946 and settling in the New Orleans area, where he lived the remainder of his life. It was at this time that Percy received an inheritance from his Uncle Will that allowed him to devote himself completely to his long-standing interest in literature and philosophy. <br />I relate the biographical details because, as you read \\"The Moviegoer,\\" it seems (not surprisingly) heavily marked by Percy's life experience, the author's biography being one point of reference for the novel.<br />\\"The Moviegoer\\" is a peculiarly American and belated expression of the existential novel that had been so brilliantly articulated in France by Albert Camus. Like \\"The Stranger,\\" Percy's novel focuses on meaning-in this case, the obsession of Binx Bolling, the novel's narrator, on what he calls the \\"search\\". As Bolling says at one point, \\"the search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life.\\" And exactly what does this mean? \\"To become aware of the possibility of the search is to be onto something. Not to be onto something is to be in despair.\\" An enigmatic definition, but one which makes the reader who spends time with \\"The Moviegoer,\\" who reads the book carefully and reflectively, to think more deeply about his or her own life.<br />\\"The Moviegoer\\" is not a novel dominated by plot. At a superficial level, the novel relates, in a wry and matter-of-fact way, a few days in the seemingly unremarkable life of Bolling, a New Orleans stockbroker whose main activities are going to the movies and carrying on with each of his successive secretaries. \\"Once I thought of going into law or medicine or even pure science. I even dreamed of doing something great. But there is much to be said for giving up such grand ambitions and living the most ordinary life imaginable, a life without the old longings; selling stocks and bonds and mutual funds; quitting work at five o'clock like everyone else; having a girl and perhaps one day settling down and raising a flock of Marcias and Sandras and Lindas of my own.\\"<br />What \\"The Moviegoer\\" suggests is resonant of Thoreau's contention that most men lead lives of quiet desperation. But it is a desperation that arises not from the ordinariness of everyday lives, but, rather, from the failure to transform that ordinariness through contemplation and self-reflection, through an appreciation for the mundane. Thus, in the book's epigraph, Percy quotes Kierkegaard: \\"the specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\\" As Percy has suggested in another of his books, \\"Lost in the Cosmos\\" (a work of non-fiction subtitled \\"The Last Self-Help Book\\"), we inhabit a society of alienated and despairing \\"non-suicides\\" who Percy wanted to transform, through his writing, into \\"ex-suicides\\". In Binx Bolling's words: \\"For some time now the impression has been growing upon me that everyone is dead. It happens when I speak to people. In the middle of the sentence it will come over me: yes, beyond a doubt this is death . . . At times it seems that the conversation is spoken by automatons who have no choice in what they say.\\" <br />\\"The Moviegoer\\" is a thoughtful and a thought-provoking book that should be read and then re-read, slowly and carefully, for every paragraph is laden with insight into the character of its narrator, the character of its author and, ultimately, the character of ourselves.	2002-04-25

I think, particularly, of Mary Karr (&quot;The Liar's Club&quot; and, more recently, &quot;Cherry&quot;) and Kathryn Harrison (&quot;The Kiss&quot;) and, of course, Frank McCourt's Irish ramblings, among others. But thirty or so years before all these candid, sometimes titillating, self confessions, Frank Conroy wrote a book titled &quot;Stop-Time,&quot; a memoir that surpasses all of them in the beauty of its prose and the poignant and deep sensitivity of its feeling.<br />&quot;Stop-Time&quot; tells the story of Frank Conroy's first eighteen years of life, a life marked by the ordinary rather than the lurid or unseemly. But the ordinariness of the life is elevated by the dreamlike, sensitive, asynchronous wonder of Conroy's writing. As Conroy relates in the first chapter of his narrative, in a passage that gives you a feeling for his writing style and for the narrative to follow: &quot;My faith in the firmness of time slips away gradually. I begin to believe that chronological time is an illusion and that some other principle organizes existence. My memories flash like clips of film from unrelated movies.&quot; <br />&quot;Stop-Time&quot; is a stunning example of how great writing can elevate even the most ordinary of lives. The facts of Conroy's memoir are not remarkable. He grew up in relatively poor circumstances, his father died of cancer when he was 12 and lived most of his life apart from Conroy's mother, he spent his time primarily between New York and Florida, and he was a bright boy who performed miserably in school. But while the broad outlines of his life are seemingly unremarkable, Conroy possesses the great gift of the writer: he can focus on the mote of dust floating in the sunlight and take the reader into a world of dreams and memories that are startlingly real, a world that the reader can feel and identify from his or her own recollections of growing up. <br />Conroy can lie down in a kennel with his family's dogs and dream that he, too, is a dog running through a field. He can relate the fear of being left alone in a cold cabin in the middle of winter while his mother and her boyfriend work the third shift at a state mental institution. He can recall a trip to the carnival with his best friend and how he was cheated and more by a seedy carnie hawker. He can precisely detail learning all the tricks you can do with a yo-yo, and learn them well. And he can recall the tumescent longings of early adolescence, of sneaking and peeking with his cousin and, as he got older, of experiencing, too. It is all related with a feeling, with a literary sense, that would be called &quot;perfect pitch&quot; if it were music. <br />&quot;Stop-Time&quot; is a remarkably written memoir that not only should be read, but also studied, as a stunning example of how the literary imagination can give vibrant life to the mundane.	2002-04-25

I know about him, however, because the movie 'Fight Club' is based upon Palahniuk's novel of the same title. Chuck Palahniuk is a big fan of Denis Johnson's collection of short stories, 'Jesus' Son.' A recent article about Palahniuk in Poets & Writers Magazine says that Palahniuk 'has read 'Jesus' Son' over and over'more than two hundred times.' Palahniuk says, in that article, 'whenever I'm stuck, that's a book I read to sort of jump start myself.'<br />Palahniuk's endorsement was good enough for me. Any book that someone has read more than two hundred times must be worthwhile, or at least worth taking a look at. Besides, this remarkable collection of short stories is only 160 pages long, the pages are small (I measured it and it was about 7' x 4'), and there are not many words on each page. It doesn't take long to read. If it matters, I also always knew Denis Johnson was out there, a highly regarded poet and novelist, ever since 'Fiskadoro' had been published more than a decade ago. I had to read something by him sometime.<br />I sat down last night and started reading 'Jesus' Son' and didn't put it down until I was finished. It didn't take me long and was worth every minute. 'Jesus' Son' contains eleven short stories, all written in the first person, all connected by the common voice of the same narrator, a young, strung-out misfit whose pathology permeates every story. The stories are grim, just like the dark, desperate life of the narrator, just like the violent, disconnected, drug-clouded lives of the people who surround him. They are stories in which the narrator seemingly transcends his life, his drug- and alcohol-induced cloud of unknowing illuminating an at times crystalline-pure vision of the world. The physical world becomes continuous with the mental world in rushes of stunning prose. Thus, in 'Car Crash While Hitchhiking,' Johnson's narrator, sitting in the back of a car: 'Under Midwestern clouds like greatgrey brains we left the superhighway with a drifting sensation and entered Kansas City's rush hour with a sensation of running aground.' And later, while in a hospital emergency room, his mind drifts in a kind of hallucinatory fugue: 'It was raining. Gigantic ferns leaned over us. The forest drifted down a hill. I could hear a creek rushing down rocks. And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to help you.' <br />The writing is brilliant, attaining remarkable heights of intensity and clarity. At the same time, the characters and the events are dark and disturbing, the narrative interrupted and discontinuous. There is drug addiction, alcoholism, violence, torture, murder, voyeurism. There is a disturbing coldness, but also a profound clarity. It is writing from the bowels of life, writing that achieves its power through prose that is as hard, as pure, as the finest diamond. 'Jesus' Son' is not an upbeat collection of stories, but it is resplendent with a writing style and an imagination that celebrates the power of fiction written with stark feeling, written so it reflects the real lives of its desperate characters.	2002-04-25

If \\"Mistero Buffo\\" has a shortcoming, it lies in the fact that it is merely a text and does not embody the vitality of Fo's imaginative work, which relies as much on performance as it does on literary content. <br />\\"Mistero Buffo\\" draws on the popular and comic tradition of the medieval mystery plays, as well as the tradition of the so-called \\"jongleur\\", or traveling comic and mime, whose performances provided a subversive counterpoint to the authority of Church, Monarchy and Lord. As the jongleur in Fo's piece, \\"The Birth of the Jongleur,\\" reminds his audience: \\"I leap and pirouette, and make you laugh. I make fun of those in power, and I show you how puffed up and conceited are the bigshots who go around making wars in which we are the ones who get slaughtered. I reveal them for what they are. I pull out the plug, and . . . pssss . . .they deflate.\\"<br />Written and originally performed by Fo himself, \\"Mistero Buffo\\" consists of a series of pieces involving mime, improvisation and performance art. The texts are fiercely anti-Church, anti-materialist and anti-authority, but they are written with a comic verve and playful sensibility that mark Dario Fo as a remarkably unique writer, director, and performer. Drawing on religious traditions, the pieces include Fo's modern take on Biblical stories entitled \\"Slaughter of the Innocents,\\" \\"Marriage at Cana\\" and \\"Resurrection of Lazarus,\\" as well as a series of short dialogues (entitled \\"Passion Plays\\") where Fo adumbrates the death of Christ as experienced by Mary. All of these pieces border on the blasphemous, subverting conventional pieties and unthinking reverence for established religion and replacing them with a kind of popular re-writing of Christianity, a revision which glorifies the common man at the expense of those in power. Not surprisingly, \\"Mistero Buffo,\\" like most of Fo's texts and performances, is controversial and provocative. It is also, however, a short text worth reading for an insightful sampling of one of Italy's most remarkable literary and theatrical geniuses.	2002-04-23

Perhaps few of the theatregoers realized that the &quot;madhouse&quot; they had witnessed was a watershed in the history of drama. While many of the innovations of &quot;Six Characters&quot; may now seem commonplace, Pirandello's innovative, iconoclastic masterpiece marked a break from traditional dramatic structures and stage settings, a break which enabled twentieth century drama to develop along self-reflective imaginative lines much different than its predecessors. As Eric Bentley, the play's translator, notes in his introduction to this edition, &quot;this was the first play ever written in which the boards of the theatre did not symbolize and represent some other place, some other reality.&quot;<br />&quot;Six Characters&quot; is set in a theatre where a director, his stage manager and a group of actors are about to rehearse another of Pirandello's plays, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;. The curtain is up, the stage is empty of props and background, and the lights illuminate the bare wall at the back of the stage. It is an austere setting, a kind of theatrical analogue to the blank sheet of paper an author faces each day he sits down to write.<br />Suddenly, this austerity, this mundane theatrical rehearsal, is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of six characters--a father, a mother, a son, a stepdaughter, a boy, and a little girl. They are six characters who have lives, who have stories to tell, but whose dramatic text has not been written. They need an author. As Pirandello says in his 1925 introduction to the play: &quot;Every creature of fantasy and art, in order to exist, must have his drama, that is, a drama in which he may be a character and for which he is a character. This drama is the character's raison d'etre, his vital function, necessary for his existence.&quot; <br />The play proceeds, with the six characters relating fragmentary scenes of incidents in their lives, scenes which are accompanied by commentary, quarrels, dialogue, and interaction among the characters and between the characters and the actors. A kind of theatrical hall of mirrors, the actors who view these characters become, in effect, an audience. The actors are also, however, the actors who will be called upon to play the parts of the six characters in the dramatic text which is being created in their presence. For these actors and these characters, the stage becomes more real than the world.<br />&quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; is a remarkable work of imagination, both in its structure and its dialogue. It is comic and absurd, tragic and ponderous. The play is a work of original genius; the text (like its characters) is open to multiple interpretations and meanings. As one character says, in an appropriate Pirandellian bit of dialogue: &quot;[t]herein lies the drama . . . in my awareness that each of us thinks of himself as one but that, well, it's not true, each of us is many, oh so many, according to the possibilities that are in us.&quot;	2002-04-23

It is a streaming, sensuous work of chaotic experience, forever carving the &quot;Beat&quot; spirit into the soul of American literature. It is a book which must be judged not simply by looking at whether it conforms to traditional notions of technical literary technique (because it does not), but, rather, upon Kerouac's own terms, which are much different. In Kerouac's words, in a 1968 Paris Review interview: &quot;I spent my entire youth writing slowly with revisions and endless rehashing speculation and deleting and got so I was writing one sentence a day and the sentence had no FEELING. Goddamn it, FEELING is what I like in art, not CRAFTINESS and the hiding of feelings.&quot;<br />&quot;On the Road&quot; has little in the way of plot or careful character development, the story being largely a chaotic narrative of the New York to San Francisco and back again adventures of Dean Moriarty (modeled almost wholly on the real life Beat figure Neal Cassady) and Sal Paradise (the erstwhile Kerouac himself), together with Beat buddies like Carlo Marx (Allen Ginsberg) and Bull Lee (William Burroughs). But its breathless, rambling narration of transient experience is a kind of literary &quot;free fall&quot; through the world of unfettered possibility that the open road offered in post-World War II America. It is a book heavily influenced by Jazz culture, as well as the culture of America's cities, the open highways which connect them, and America's love affair with the car. <br />Kerouac got the idea for &quot;On the Road&quot; from Neal Cassady himself, the model for Dean Moriarty. In Kerouac's words, &quot;[I saw] how good old Neal Cassady wrote his letters to me, all first person, fast, mad, confessional, completely serious, all detailed.&quot; Being a very rapid typist, Kerouac took this idea, taped together twelve-foot long sheets of paper, fed them into the typewriter and, fortified by pea soup, coffee and benzedrine, began writing. It was a novel technique-a technique which prompted Truman Capote to say that &quot;On the Road&quot; wasn't really &quot;writing&quot;, it was just &quot;typing&quot;-but it resulted in one of the classic works of modern American literature. <br />In Ken Kesey's words, &quot;Kerouac was part of the ongoing exploration of the American frontier, looking for new land, trying to escape the dust bowls of existence. He had a deep connection to the American romantic vision.&quot; It is this romantic vision, this connection with that long strand of American literature and culture that began with the frontier and its endless possibilities, that makes &quot;On the Road&quot; a book still worth reading today, a book that vividly captures something of what it's like to live and dream in America.	2002-04-23

I consciously use the term \\"Beat Generation\\", rather than \\"Beat Movement\\", because the collection incorporates a diverse group of poets and writers who, while largely contemporaries, are each so idiosyncratic in their own right that it is inaccurate to lump them together in a single \\"movement\\". All of the interviews originally appeared in \\"The Paris Review\\" between 1965 and 1998. Each interview is preceded by a short biographical introduction and a description of the circumstances in which the interview occurred.<br />If there is any unifying characteristic among these writers, it is their rejection of literary formalism and their reliance upon sponaneity. As Lawrence Ferlinghetti observerves in his 1998 interview, one of the best in this collection, \\"I would call it the 'graph of consciousness' school of poetry because the poetry, as conceived and as defined in this manner, is exactly what goes through your consciousness at any given moment.\\"<br />Consistent with Ferlinghetti's view of the Beat poets, Allen Ginsberg thus proclaims in his 1996 interview, that \\"there should be no distinction between what we write down and what we really know.\\" Attacking literary formalism, the owlish iconoclastic \\"Howl\\" author notes: \\"the hypocrisy of literature has been-you know like there's supposed to be formal literature, which is supposed to be different from . . . in subject, in diction and even in organization, from our quotidian inspired lives.\\"<br />Not surprisingly, Ginsberg's poetics echo the 1968 interview with Jack Kerouac, the breathless unpunctuated Beat proponent of unrevised prose, the very inventor of the term \\"Beat\\". In Kerouac's words, \\"by not revising what you've already written you simply give the reader the actual workings of your thoughts about events in your unchangeable way.\\"<br />Charles Olson, whose virtually unintelligible 1970 interview appears here, follows this same poetic line. Olson (more appropriately identified with the \\"Black Mountain School\\") advocated so-called \\"open-field composition\\", described by George Plimpton in his introduction to the Olson interview as \\"poetry whose appearance and internal logic are governed by the spontaneity of the writing process.\\"<br />Thus, in some respects, Beat poetics seems to resemble the spontaneity, the anti-formalism of Surrealist automatic writing (something which Ferlinghetti suggests in his interview). But this resemblance is attenuated by the Beat experience of America and of the Beats turn to the East (specifically, Buddhism) and to the influence of consciousness-expanding drugs. Furthermore, while there may be unifying strands running through Beat poetics, this collection of interviews also demonstrates the remarkable diversity of these authors, a diversity which makes it difficult to collate their writings under any unified theory. After reading the interviews with William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder, a reader is enthralled and exasperated at the eclection of thought among them.<br />\\"Beat Writers at Work\\" contains exceptional interviews with Ferlinghetti, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, Snyder, Paul Bowles, and Ken Kesey. These interviews make this collection required reading for anyone interested in the Beats. The interviews with Ferlinghetti and Barney Rosset also provide an insightful look at the role of City Lights Books and Grove Press in publishing the Beats in their early days, a time when censorship made such publication a financially parlous venture for small presses. Finally, Elissa Schappell, a contributing editor of \\"The Paris Review\\", provides a fascinating memoir of a graduate class taught by Ginsberg in 1995. The only weak pieces in this collection are the 1980 \\"conversation\\" among Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Russian poet Andrei Vosnesensky and the largely unintelligible wordplay of Charles Olson's 1970 interview. There is also one notable author missing: Gregory Corso, who is, in Ferlinghetti's words, \\"the most important Beat poet after Ginsberg.\\"	2002-04-23

As Remembered and Viewed from Chicago	Alexander Hemon left his home in Sarajevo in 1992 to visit a friend in Chicago. The visit was intended to last a few months. Hemon never returned to Bosnia, however, because the Bosnian-Serb army had surrounded his hometown on the very day he planned to return. Undaunted, Hemon, a half-Serbian, half-Ukrainian writer, remained in Chicago, where he worked at a number of menial jobs and began learning English. He published his first story in English in 1995 and, five years later, the collection of seven stories and a novella that form \\"The Question of Bruno.\\" <br />Perhaps because he is from Eastern Europe and had been a writer in his native language before he learned English, he has often been compared to Nabokov. While the comparison is simplistic, it is seemingly suggested by Hemon himself, at one point, when he related to Salon Magazine how he learned English: \\"I read 'Lolita' in English and underlined the words I didn't know.\\" However, unlike Nabokov, who circulated largely in academic circles, Hemon spent two and a half years canvassing for Greenpeace, where he met and spoke with thousands of people of every stripe, developing an ear for English as it is actually spoken. It is not surprising, then, that Hemon's writing is less academic and obscure than that of Nabokov.<br />\\"The Question of Bruno\\" is a remarkably good collection of stories that continually engage the reader. Like many first works of fiction, the stories, while fictional, appear to draw heavily from Hemon's own experiences, particularly those of living under Marshall Tito's communism and the implosion of Yugoslavia which followed Tito's death, of growing up in a family with roots in both Serbia and the Ukraine, and, ultimately, living and writing in a language not his own. Hemon's writing is vivid, intelligent and darkly humorous, his style marked by keen description and uniquely discordant turns of phrase that sometimes seem to reflect his alienation from the English language in which he writes as much as his remarkable skill as a writer.<br />The best of the stories in this collection is \\"A Coin,\\" a tale of Aida, a woman living in Sarajevo under siege, and a man, presumably Hemon, living in Chicago, where he worries about Aida, about whether she is still among the living. Thus, Aida relates what it's like in Sarajevo: \\"Suppose there is a Point A and a Point B and that, if you want to get from Point A to Point B, you have to pass through an open space clearly visible to a skillful sniper.\\" And Hemon, the author, relates from the disconnected safety of his dingy Chicago apartment: \\"I open my mailbox-a long tunnel dead-ending with a dark square-and I find Aida's letter, I shiver with dread. What terrifies me is that, as I rip the exhausted envelope, she may be dead. . . I dread the fact that life is always slower than death and I have been chosen, despite my weakness, against my will, to witness the discrepancy.\\" \\"A Coin\\" is a remarkable story which vividly captures both the hellish, contingent existence of Aida in war-torn Sarajevo and the dark anxiety of her Chicago correspondent.<br />\\"The Sorge Spy Ring\\" is another outstanding story, the fictional childhood memoir of a boy growing up in Sarajevo during the time of Tito, a boy fascinated with spies who develops an elaborate fantasy that his father is a spy. It is a fantasy that seemingly becomes grim reality when Marshal Tito's security police appear in the middle of the night and take the boy's father away. He is released from prison several years later, \\"diagnosed with brain cancer, curled into an old man, with most of his teeth missing.\\" Longer than the story itself is the subtext, a series of forty footnotes that relate snippets of the biography of Richard Sorge, a real-life Soviet spy who achieved high rank in the German army and the Nazi Party and was eventually executed by Japanese security police in 1944. <br />\\"Exchange of Pleasant Words\\" is a wonderful fictional memoir of the Hemon family historyand a Hemon family reunion of sorts. \\"Inspired by the success of the Sarajevo Olympiad and the newly established ancient family history, the family council, headed righteously by my father, decided to have an epic get-together, which was to be held only once, and was to be recorded as the Hemoniad.\\"<br />\\"Blind Josef Pronek & Dead Souls,\\" which runs to nearly eighty pages and may be characterized as a novella, tells the story of a man named Pronek who emigrates to Chicago from Sarajevo in 1992. The story appears to be, of course, the thinly fictionalized, episodic story of the author himself. While somewhat uneven in quality, the story within the novella titled \\"Iceberg Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce\\" is a wonderfully humorous narrative of Pronek's first job in the United States that displays Hemon's writing at its best.<br />\\"The Life and Work of Alphonse Kauders\\" is a series of short, factual statements about a character named Alphonse Kauders, who appears Zelig-like (as one reviewer has aptly put it) at various important moments in history and with various historical personages. It is a humorous and enigmatic piece that is accompanied by a glossary providing background on its referents.<br />Finally, there are three shorter stories. \\"Imitation of Life\\" is a wonderful little memoir of childhood recollection, fantasy and film. \\"The Accordion\\" is an almost photographic tale of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \\"Islands,\\" the first story in the book, is another reminiscence of a childhood trip from Yugoslavia to the coast that suffers from excessive and discordant use of language. It is the weakest of the writing in this collection, a story that has a kind of strangeness that apparently derives as much from Hemon's alienation from the English language as it does from any innate skill as a writer.	2002-04-23

There was little in the way of material comfort, most people struggling merely to subsist. Liberty, too, was scarce in a feudal system dominated by the often capricious and competing forces of King, Lord and Church. And there were intermingled the ubiquitous spectres of magic, superstition, banditry, and disease. With the ravages of the Black Death, life in the late Middle Ages was truly nasty, brutish and short. <br />Against this background, Barry Unsworth's \\"Morality Play\\" weaves a masterful and compelling tale of Nicholas Barber, a twenty-three year old priest, \\"a poor scholar, open-breeched to the winds of heaven as people say, with nothing but Latin to recommend [him].\\" Nicholas, after commiting adultery and losing his cloak while fleeing the wrathful husband, takes up with an itinerant band of players. He thus becomes both a fugitive, by leaving his diocese without permission of his Bishop, and a sinner by entering upon an occupation forbidden by the Church.<br />The players soon find themselves in a town where Thomas Wells, a twelve year old boy, has been murdered and a young woman has been hastily tried, convicted and sentenced to hang for the crime. It is then that their leader, Martin, suggests that the troupe depart from the accepted practice of the day, the enactment of plays based upon Biblical stories with well-known themes. Martin proposes, instead, that they perform a \\"Morality Play\\" based upon the murder of Thomas Wells. It is a proposal fraught with peril, not only to their physical safety, but also to their moral well-being, for as Nicholas suggests, \\"if we make our own meanings, God will oblige us to answer our own questions, He will leave us in the void without the comfort of his Word.\\"<br />The players accept Martin's suggestion, and soon the facts surrounding the murder of Thomas Wells, as well as the motives and behavior of the players, becometroubling and enigmatic. The result is an absorbing narrative that unravels as part murder mystery, part suspense story and part historical fiction, the telling all the time enriched by Nicholas Barber's first person voice and diction. <br />\\"Morality Play\\" leaves the reader with a profoundly satisfying feeling for the historical period and the characters. But the book also operates on a deeper level, the text providing an often thought-provoking gloss on the relationship between theatre and reality, between life on the stage and real life. \\"Morality Play\\" is, thus, like all great fiction, not only an entertainment, but an intellectually stimulating short novel that educates even as it delights.	2002-04-23

In accordance with this model, there also has been a tendency to identify such canonical works as the \\"cause\\" of historical events. Eighteenth century French history has not been an exception, many historians arguing, rightly or wrongly, that the Enlightenment writings of Voltaire, Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau provided the ideological basis for the French Revolution. <br />There are, of course, many problems with this approach. Among those problems, Robert Darnton suggests in his fascinating and carefully researched \\"The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France,\\" is that, \\"if we put the issue that way, we are likely to distort it, first by reifying the Enlightenment as if it could be separated from everything else in eighteenth-century culture; then by injecting into it an analysis of the Revolution, as if it could be traced through the events of 1789-1800 like a substance being monitored in the bloodstream.\\" <br />Moreover, as Darnton's book argues, any approach that focusses exclusively on the canonical literature of the Enlightenment necessarily misses the mark since there was a flourishing popular and illegal underground literature, the so-called \\"livres philosophiques\\" or \\"philosophical books,\\" that exerted a powerful impact on eighteenth century French culture and politics. These were the books sold \\"under the cloak,\\" illegal books forbidden by the French Monarchy because they undermined the authority of the king, the Church, or conventional morality. \\"By sampling them, the reader will be able to form his or her own impressions of the world of illegal literature. It may seem surprising, shocking, naughty, or comic; but it certainly will look different from the world made familiar by the great-man, great-book variety of literary history.\\"<br/>From these premises, Darnton carefully explores the trade in forbidden books in seventeenth and eighteenth century France and the potential impact of that trade on popular consciousness and the ever-changing way in which the French Monarchy was perceived from the reign of Louis XIV until the Revolution. Darnton elucidates the mechanics of the book trade of the time, how it worked to disseminate forbidden literature, and which forbidden books attained \\"best seller\\" status. Darnton also elaborates on the various categories of forbidden literature, including the works of philosophical pornography, utopian fantasy and political slander which fed the public's desire for transgressive works and, ultimately, undermined the foundations of monarchical legitimacy. Finally, in painting this brilliant history of the forbidden book in pre-Revolutionary France, Darnton carefully and persuasively outlines the details of the vast communcations network which existed in French society in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, a network which ran from Court to café to popular pamphlet to book and back, each element operating in a way which served to reinforce popular (and usually unfavorable) notions of the Court and Church and create a fertile breeding ground for social unrest.<br />In all of this, Darnton displays great care in sifting the historical evidence and avoiding hasty conclusions. If anything, his research asks as many questions as it answers, leaving the reader with a much deeper understanding of the complexity of the historian's task in reaching any firm conclusions about the interplay between popular literature, Enlightenment ideas and the Revolution in France. \\"The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France\\" is a carefully researched and fascinating piece of historical writing, a book which I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the book.	2002-04-22

The &quot;Handbook&quot; has nearly one thousand entries, large and small, providing comprehensive coverage, in a single volume, of every aspect of Russian literature during the past ten centuries. A large format book with small print and double columns on each page, the &quot;Handbook&quot; contains entries written by over one hundred leading scholars and ably edited by Victor Terras.<br />The entries range from one or two lines to several thousand words over several pages. There are biographical entries of Russian authors, little and well known, as well as entries on various genres, historical periods, literary movements, literary journals and periodicals, and critical theories. Each entry includes a bibliography and, in addition, there is a useful general bibliography, broken out by historical periods, at the end of the book. The &quot;Handbook&quot; is, in other words, a perfect reference and entrée into the world of Russian literature. I find myself dipping into this book often, at random, and never fail to learn something new and interesting. I also use it as a valuable source of background reading when I sit down to read a Russian author. <br />The only shortcomings of the &quot;Handbook&quot; are that its print is very small (allowing the book, of course, to cram an immense amount of information in less than 600 pages) and that it devotes little coverage to authors of roughly the last quarter of the twentieth century, including some of the so-called &quot;dissident&quot; authors who wrote in the years immediately preceding publication (a shortcoming, however, that is excusable because most of the research for the &quot;Handbook&quot; was done in the early 1980s and the book was published in 1985). Also, while the bibliographies are useful for the casualreader, serious research requires reference to more recent sources.	2002-04-22

Nearly all of these essays were published after 1985, predominantly in Salmagundi, The New York Review of Books and The New Republic. It is an outstanding collection of essays by a scholar of wide-ranging, thoughtful and sober intelligence.<br />The collection is divided into two parts. The first part, \\"Intellectual Craftsmanship,\\" contains a series of polemical essays that deal with topics generally subsumed in recent years under the term \\"Culture Wars.\\" In this part, Shattuck stakes out his position clearly in a number of essays dealing with the proper role of education and the importance of the canon. Thus, in the essay \\"Nineteen Theses on Literature,\\" Shattuck states that, \\"we have brought ourselves to a great deal of perplexity about the basic role of education.\\" This perplexity arises from the question of whether education's proper role should be \\"[to] socialize the young within an existing culture and offer them the means to succeed within that culture\\" or, in the alternative, \\"[to] give to the young the means to challenge and overthrow the existing culture, presumably in order to achieve a better life.\\" Shattuck's response is in favor of the former, choosing a conservative view of education's role. In doing so, he essentially resolves this question consistent with a position he articulates in another of his essays, \\"Education, Higher and Lower,\\" where he states that, \\"some of us have come to believe that it is possible, even necessary, to be liberal in political matters and conservationist in cultural matters.\\"<br />These polemical pieces on the role of education are followed by a number of essays that explore such topics as \\"The Spiritual in Art,\\" \\"How We Think at the Movies\\" (where he explores, among other things, whether thinking is possible without language), \\"Life Before Language: Nathalie Sarraute\\" (where he examines Sarraute's attempts to capture, in fiction, mental life as it exists before it \\"gets caught and stifled in the rough net of conventional language\\"), \\"Michel Foucault,\\" and \\"Radical Skepticism and How We Got There.\\" In all of these essays, Shattuck explores, with erudition and balance, a range of topics that have been prone in recent years to irrational polemics.<br />The second part of the collection, \\"A Critics Job of Work,\\" contains essays that are best described as literary journalism. In a series of essays under the broad title \\"Tracking the Avant Guard in France,\\" Shattuck explores the biographies and artistic significance of a range of artists and writers, including Marcel Duchamp, Hans Arp, Sarah Bernhardt, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Cocteau. The most telling of his essays in this part of the book is titled \\"From Aestheticism to Fascism,\\" where Shattuck calmly proffers the lineage that ran from the \\"antinomian, decadent aestheticism\\" of the \\"art for art's sake\\" movement to the 'irrationalism, racism and nationalism that produced the most vicious and destructive aberration of modern times' in Germany and Italy. <br />The final essays in the collection are broadly grouped under the title \\"America, Africa and Elsewhere.\\" Here, Shattuck explores a number of writers, including Mary Settle, Arthur Miller, Octavio Paz, V. S. Naipaul, and Leopold Senghor, as well as the artistic significance of the collaboration between Stieglitz and O'Keefe. These essays are wide ranging, insightful and balanced. The last of these essays, \\"Scandal and Stereotypes on Broadway: The New Puritanism,\\" seemingly comes full circle from the opening essay of the book insofar as Shattuck reiterates his culturally conservative position in a stinging review of \\"Angels in America,\\" stating that it was a play for which he was ashamed of himself for not having walked out. In Shattuck's words, the play \\"represents Puritanism inverted.\\" <br />\\"Candor & Perversion\\" reaffirms Roger Shattuck's position as one of America's foremost cultural commentators. If you're interested in the polemics that have engulfed education, literature and the arts in the past decade, I can only say: read this book! You may not agree with Shattuck, but you will find his intelligent and careful reasoning regarding these issues a refreshing change from the often muddled and irrational posturing that characterizes much writing on these very important subjects.	2002-04-22

What really happens is that God gathers everybody in one large hall. Then He gives them the Talmud and commands them to start studying. For the wicked, studying Talmud is hell. For the pious, it's heaven.\\"<br />Halbertal's tale amusingly illustrates the importance that sacred texts play in Judaism and provides a fitting entrée into this short, but fascinating, exploration of the development and importance of the Bible, the Mishnah and the Talmud as canonical works of the Jewish community.<br />Halbertal begins with a short introduction adumbrating the meaning of a \\"canonical\\" text and its various guises. The adjective, of course, refers to a text's special status in a community. The special status of a canon can be \\"normative\\" (it is obeyed and followed as the law of a community), \\"formative\\" (it is a curriculum that is taught, read, transmitted, and interpreted) or \\"exemplary\\" (it is a paradigm for aesthetic value and achievement). For example, the Talmud is both a normative and a formative canon of the traditional Jewish community; normative in the sense that it establishes appropriate behavior in many aspects of life, formative in the sense that it is a fundamental text that is the object of endless interpretation and debate and, in some cases, the intellectual sine qua non of membership in the community. <br />From this brief introduction, \\"People of the Book\\" then explores, in successive chapters (which mirror the chronological development of each successive text), the canonization of the Bible, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and what the ascendancy of each of these texts meant for the formation of authority and meaning in the Jewish community. He also explores the challenges that philosophy and Kabbalah posed to the Talmudic canon in the Middle Ages and closes with a short appendix discussing how Hobbes and Spinoza appropriated and interpreted the canonical text of the Hebrew Bible in their political philosophy.<br />In less than one hundred fifty pages (excluding the extensive footnotes), Moshe Halbertal has written a challenging and thoughtful exploration of the development of the canonical works of Judaism and how those canonical works shaped authority and meaning in the community and between the community and the non-Jewish world. \\"People of the Book\\" is a concise, but intellectually rich, exegesis of the key texts of Judaism and how those texts shaped Jewish thought through the ages.	2002-04-22

Writing about the affair in The Times of London, Mosley related that all of his choices were rejected because they were 'novels of ideas, or novels in which characters were subservient to ideas.' He went on to opine, in a statement that seems to apply as much to his Whitbread Prize-winning novel 'Hopeful Monsters' as to his view of his Booker choices: 'My point was that humans were beings who did have ideas, who were often influenced by ideas, to whom ideas were important. If they were not, then there was some lack in being human.' <br />'Hopeful Monsters' is a novel where character development is subservient to ideas, where narrative action takes place against big historical events. While it ostensibly tells the story of a life-long romantic relationship between Max Ackerman, an English physicist, and Eleanor Anders, a German-Jewish anthropologist, the romance is as much a vehicle for the promulgation and exploration of ideas as it is a tale of a man and a woman in the twentieth century. <br />'Hopeful Monsters' begins at the end of World War I. Max is ten years old and lives outside Cambridge, England. His father is a biologist who specializes in genetic inheritance and his mother is a woman of seeming artistic interests who had been 'brought up on the fringes of what was even then known as the Bloomsbury Group.' His parents have had long ties to the Cambridge University community. Eleanor, too, lives in an intellectual milieu, one in which ideas predominate. Eleanor lives in Berlin, where her mother is a Marxist and follower of Rosa Luxemburg and her father is a lecturer in philosophy. From such beginnings, novels of ideas are made!<br />From this starting point, 'Hopeful Monsters' narrates the story of Max and Eleanor through the rise of Nazism in Germany, the post-Lenin rise to power of Joseph Stalin, the Spanish Civil War, and the development of the Atomic Bomb. It does this while, all the time, interweaving Darwinism (and its Lamarckian heresy), Marxism, quantum physics and the uncertainty principle, Freudian psychoanalysis, Jungian archetypes, and even suggestions of Jewish mysticism. It is a story that runs from 1918 until the 1970s and continually challenges the reader to think about the ideas, the opinions, the intellectual sensibilities and feelings of Max, Eleanor and the books other characters. It is a magnificent and challenging novel of ideas, a novel that deservedly won the Whitbread Prize in 1990.<br />If 'Hopeful Monsters' has any shortcomings, it is that ideas and historical events predominate at the expense of character development. It also suffers, at times, from a somewhat turgid prose style. In particular, Mosley is fond of introducing statements by Eleanor and Max with the clauses 'I said' and 'You said'. It is a construction that helps the reader follow long spoken exchanges, but gets a bit tedious. Mosley also tends to write sentences as statements with a question mark at the end. This, too, can be annoying, suggesting a rising inflection by the speaker that can hardly be the intent. These are, however, relatively minor failings in a novel which is majestic in the breadth and depth of its intellectual suggestiveness, a really big modern novel that deserves to be more widely read.	2002-04-22

When her father accepts a visiting professorship at the University of California, and her mother decides to accompany him abroad, Ma-chan is left at home in Japan to care for her older, brain-damaged brother Eeyore (like the character in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;) and her younger brother, Oh-chan, who is studying for his university entrance exams.<br />&quot;A Quiet Life&quot; is a slow-moving story with little action and a deeply realistic, human touch. Like much of Oe's writing, &quot;A Quiet Life&quot; is a fictional work that is powerfully marked by a real-life event--the birth of Oe's brain-damaged son in the mid-1960s. Thus, Ma-chan, the narrator, grapples throughout the narrative with her feelings about Eeyore, as well as her feelings about her intellectual and emotionally distant father.<br />Much of the novel is devoted to exploring Ma-chan's thoughts and feelings as she follows a mundane, day-to-day existence shepherding Eeyore to music lessons with Mr. Shegito, a professor and friend of her father, and to swimming lessons with Mr. Akai, a somewhat cold and sinister character of questionable motives. Along the way, Ma-chan continually realizes that Eeyore is, in many ways, a remarkably sensitive and gifted human being, despite his disability.<br />Oe's narrative is enigmatic and subtle in its suggestiveness. Oe, through the voice of his narrator, makes much of words that Ma-chan repeats in her narrative, words that are italicized in the text and linger in the reader's mind like ontological talismans. The text, too, reflects the intellectual groundings of Ma-chan's distant father-seemingly the author Oe himself-when it delves into extended discussions of Tarkovsky's film, &quot;Stalker&quot; (based on the classic, if somewhat obscure science fiction novel, &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; written by the Strugatsky brothers), and the writings of Celine, notably &quot;Rigadoon&quot; (in a somewhat disturbingly sympathetic literary riff on a notorious, albeit fascinating, anti-semite). <br />While I am familiar with Oe's biography, this is the first novel I have read by him. He is an interesting and intellectually impressive writer who perhaps deserved the 1994 Nobel Prize for Literature. I know I will read more of his work. However, as Ma-chan's mother comments when Ma-chan tells her of the title of the diary she has kept: &quot;'Diary as Home' sounds bland and dull.&quot; She then elicits a different title from Eeyore, who suggests: &quot;How about 'A Quiet Life'? That's what our life's all about.&quot; It is, indeed, the narrative of a quiet life, but Eeyore's title unfortunately does not save Oe's book from being bland and dull. While &quot;A Quiet Life&quot; is redeemed by the sensitivity, the enigmatic feeling and the profound intellect of its author, the story ultimately falters on a sometimes mind-numbing banality and what seems to be a stilted English translation. Thus, while I enjoyed reading &quot;A Quite Life,&quot; I often had difficulty maintaining my interest in Oe's narrative.	2002-04-22

It is appropriate and commendable, then, that Grove Press has undertaken the publication of the King James Version in a series of small (4&quot;x5 ¾&quot;) , inexpensive, book-by-book paperback editions, known as the &quot;Pocket Canon.&quot; The initial publication includes twelve volumes, representing a sampling of the range of writings in the Old and New Testament, each introduced by a contemporary writer.<br />&quot;The First Book of Moses, Called Genesis&quot; is the first of the books in the Bible and, appropriately, the first of the books in the Pocket Canon series. And while the text itself, being the Authorized King James Version, needs no further commentary, the introduction to this little volume by E.L. Doctorow bears mentioning. In six short pages, Doctorow manages to draw the reader quickly to the literary merit and fascination of Genesis, a book whose stories and narrative strategies have endured for more than twenty-five centuries and continue to illumine and perplex the thoughtful reader. Apart from an early lapse by Doctorow, who claims the King James Version &quot;is the version preachers quote from who believe in the divinity of the text&quot; (thereby ignoring the fact that his claim, when stated this way, applies only to preachers who are both Christian and English speakers), Doctorow thoughtfully and succinctly draws the reader into the Genesis narrative, successfully writing a sort of &quot;pocket&quot; introduction to a little book with unbounded literary and religious value.<br />If you've never sat down and read the Authorized King James Version, and if you have an interest in the English language and the Bible as literature, the Pocket Canon edition of Genesis is an easy place to begin. If you have, it's still a usefullittle book because it's so small that you can conveniently carry it anywhere.	2002-04-22

It is a collection of four essays, together with a preface and prologue, by Joel Schalit. Joel is a somewhat disaffected Israeli-born, now America-residing, thirtyish contrarian. The book is subtitled \\"A Homeless Conscience in a Post-Everything World,\\" and the subtitle is a good indication of Schalit's disaffection from both the United States and Israel.<br />The first of the essays, \\"America the Enchanted,\\" is a refreshing anodyne to the glut of unthinking patriotism, President-worship, and creeping, Bush-led Fundamentalism that has permeated the United States since the events of September 11th. It is not clear whether Schalit's antennae are quivering in this essay because he grew up in the irrational religious stewpot of the Middle East or whether he is a kind of canary in the mineshaft of Dubya's America. Whichever is the case, Schalit provides ample fodder for the thoughtful American who questions the way that religious superstition and atavism insinuates itself into American life. As Schalit notes, \\"[i]f there is one central message that I want to get across, it's that religion and, more specifically, radical Protestant theology, plays a far bigger role in the contemporary United States than most commentators are willing to admit.\\"<br />The last of the essays, \\"My Own Private Israel,\\" is a narrative of Schalit's return to Israel and his ambivalent feelings about his birthplace and religious antecedents. It is a particularly timely essay in light of recent events in Israel and Palestine and a heartfelt, feeling demonstration of the way that the pull of the past continues to trouble even those who privilege the rational over the irrational. Never mincing words, Schalit is compellingly clear in his indictment of the way that Orthodox Jewish fundamentalism simultaneously pushes the State of Israel into the irrationality of policies based on delusion while, at the same time,denying the legitimacy of the secular state:<br />\\"Ultra-Orthodox Jews conceal their racist ideology of an ethnically pure Jewish polity in their spirituality, while simultaneously attacking the legitimacy of the secular Zionist state. There will be no justifiable Jewish existence, they reason, until the coming of the 'Moshiach,' the messiah. These 'holy' people let non-religious Jews do the dirty work of keeping the Arabs down, sacrificing their children to the army, while they await the 'real' Israel.\\" <br />In between these two provocative and interesting essays, Schalit incorporates an essay on his intellectual alliance with Marxism and the Left (\\"Seeing Red\\") and a perceptive essay on modern music and culture (\\"Down and Out With Rock and Roll\\"). <br />While breezy in style and far from great literature, all of these essays are thoughtul and provocative pieces that engage the reader and call attention to the often unquestioned contradictions of American and Israeli culture. Schalit's essays pose a particularly interesting challenge to those Americans and Israelis who are willing to scrutinize the conventional wisdom and pieties that have proliferated in the past year, when free thinking has become beholden to the consensus of the unthinking.	2002-04-21
US	49563640	R3OF18532WLWFG	0679762051	963527230	My Dark Places	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Dark and Disturbing Memoir of Real Life Noir	Over the past twenty years, James Ellroy has written nearly a dozen novels that have established him as the foremost contemporary successor to the noir crime fiction of forerunners such as Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett and James Cain. Set primarily in Los Angeles (although some of his novels, such as \\"American Tabloid\\", have taken on bigger settings and themes), Ellroy's narratives are marked by what one critic has described as a \\"telegraphic\\" style, one short sentence following another in a breathless staccato of hard-boiled language, graphic (at times grisly) description, and a pervasive, and often seemingly morbid and pessimistic, obsession with sexual crime and violence. <br />Ellroy is an astonishingly good writer, albeit a writer who is not for everyone: his vivid and grotesquely detailed explorations of rape and murder, of men preying on woman, of brutal police practices, often make the reader squeamish and uncomfortable. The effect is powerful testimony to the talent.<br />But where does Ellroy's remarkable writing come from? \\"My Dark Places,\\" subtitled \\"An L.A. Crime Memoir,\\" provides an answer: from the real life noir of Ellroy's life.<br />On a Sunday morning in June, 1958, James Ellroy's forty-five year old mother, Jean, was murdered. Her body was found in a vacant lot next to a school in El Monte, California, a gritty, working class city east of Los Angeles. \\"A nylon stocking and a cotton cord were lashed around her neck. Both ligatures were tightly knotted.\\" James Ellroy was ten years old at the time. His parents were divorced. He had just returned home from a weekend visit with his father when he was told about the murder. While a \\"Swarthy Man\\" was seen with the victim, the murder was never solved.<br />\\"My Dark Places\\" tells the story of Jean Ellroy's murder in 1958. It also tells the story of the next twenty years of James Ellroy's life, when he drifted to drugs and alcohol, to an obsession with crimes of sex and violence, to a kind of noirish bottom which was the prelude to his life as a writer. It tells the story of how the noir obsessions of Ellroy's fictions were the creative and self-sustaining response to the dark episodes of his real life. And, finally, it tells the story of Ellroy's renewed search for his mother's murderer and, along the way, his search for his mother herself. In Ellroy's words:<br />\\"I knew things about us. I sensed other things. Her death corrupted my imagination and gave me exploitable gift. My mother gave me the gift and the curse of obsession. It began as curiosity in lieu of childish grief. It flourished as a quest for dark knowledge and mutated into a horrible thirst for sexual and mental stimulation. Obsessive drives almost killed me. A rage to turn my obsessions into something good and useful saved me. I outlived the curse. The gift assumed its final form in language.\\"<br />\\"My Dark Places\\" is a dark and disturbing memoir, an intimate plunge into the life and the psyche of James Ellroy. It is also, like his novels, a chilling exploration of real life crimes of sex and violence in Los Angeles, Ellroy's search for his mother's murderer being the touchstone for a narrative contrail of grisly and perverse crimes that he encounters along the way.	2002-04-21
US	49563640	R1UZFQEPC8J3AX	0872863549	19328598	The Monstrous and the Marvelous	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Provocative, Difficult and Disturbing Essays	Rikki Ducornet's \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\" is a collection of fourteen previously published essays that challenge comfortable intellectual and imaginative categories, forcing the reader to think in new ways, to embrace the savage, eccentric and strange beauty of the world in all its \\"Otherness\\". It is, in short, a book not for the intellectually faint of heart, Ducornet's richly allusive prose streaming through interpretive tropes that constantly demand the reader's utmost attention and imaginative empathy. And while this wide-ranging collection appropriately has been compared to a kind of intellectual \\"wunderkammern\\" or \\"cabinet of wonders\\", Ducornet imaginatively demonstrates in these essays that the world cannot be contained within the artificial bounds of the \\"wunderkammern\\", for ultimately its contents are \\"topsy turvy and promiscuous.\\" <br />In the essay \\"Optical Terror\\", Ducornet sets the stage for the essays to follow, discussing the great Renaissance voyages of discovery, voyages \\"which revealed a sprawling world, infinitely stranger than previously imagined.\\" The curiosities that came from these voyages, the stuff of the \\"wunderkammern\\", challenged accepted notions of the world, generating the intellectual unease which ultimately led to the Enlightenment. In Ducornet's words, \\"the fantastic influx of curiosities had a profoundly unsettling effect upon pedestrian and pious minds persuaded that the finite world was created reasonably, to the measure of man and for his salvation.\\" <br />From \\"Optical Terror\\", Ducornet goes on to develop the trope of the \\"wunderkammern\\" through the diversely imagined and imaginative essays of \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\". Thus, she ranges from a stunningly imaginative essay connecting Kafka and Borges (\\"Alphabets and Emperors: Reflections on Kafka and Borges\\") to a short essay on Rosamond Purcell's studies on human monstrosities and anomalies (\\"The Impossible Genus\\") to an essay on stories of haruspication or divination by the inspection of animal entrails (\\"Sortilege\\"). There is a strangely imagined, intellectually difficult and scatologically-driven essay on Swift which bears the imprint of the excessive envisionings of Georges Bataille, and there is a quirkily dark essay exploring the lethal female body in Pasolini, David Lynch, Robert Coover, and Angela Carter. <br />Intellectually provocative, and at times deeply disturbing, the essays strive to reorder the way we see and, ultimately, the way we articulate and dream, the world. The essays transgress the boundaries of the reader's imagination, often going beyond the point of comprehension, and this is perhaps Ducornet's only weakness: the imaginative flights of imagination are so startling and, at times, abstruse that the reader struggles with her metaphors, her tropes, her meanings. But while imperfect, there is a scent of genius in \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\", a scent which is worth taking the time to savor.	2002-04-21

None of the stories is more than a few pages.  Each of the &quot;stories&quot; is a vivid prose rendering of a person or place that left a seemingly indelible impression on John Berger's acutely refined sense of seeing.  It is a collection marked by a minimalist sensibility, but not the cold, sterile minimalism found in the writing of Samuel Beckett or Gordon Lish.  It is, instead, the warm, heartfelt minimalism of a writer striving to capture the fleeting, but enduringly memorable, moments of a human life.<br />&quot;Photocopies&quot; opens not with a photocopy, but with a photograph: the blurred, poorly-lighted photograph of a man and a woman standing under a tree.  It is a sort of introduction to the first story, &quot;A Woman and Man Standing by a Plum Tree,&quot; where Berger relates his memory of a woman he once met at a reading in Madrid who then turned up, several years later, at his country home in France.  The woman is not identified by name. She is in her thirties, an artist and photographer who makes her living by restoring frescoes.  The woman brings along a primitive, home-made plywood camera and, at the end of her visit, takes a picture of the two of them together under a plum tree:<br />&quot;The two of us stood there facing the camera.  We moved, of course, but not more than the plum trees did in the wind.  Minutes passed.  Whilst we stood there, we reflected the light, and what we reflected went through the black hole into the dark box.  It'll be of us, she said, and we waited expectantly.&quot;<br />Unlike the photograph, the story that accompanies it, and the other twenty-seven stories in the collection, are clear, precise, vividly-rendered pictures from John Berger's memory.  In this sense, Berger's use of a blurred photographic image to introduce the collection is a bit of irony.  Ordinarily, a photograph is considered a very exact imageof a moment in time.  In Berger's telling, however, the more exact image is found in Berger's memory and in the reproduction (or &quot;photocopy&quot;) of that memory that is rendered in prose.<br />&quot;Photocopies&quot; includes recollections of Henri Cartier-Bresson (&quot;A Man Begging in the Metro&quot;) and Simone Weil (&quot;A Girl Like Antigone&quot;), as well as numerous unidentifiable, but memorable, friends and acquaintances of Berger.  It also includes, in typical Berger fashion, insightful thoughts on drawing (&quot;A Young Woman with Hand to Her Chin&quot;) and on the way that images of the body are influenced by local terrain and climate (&quot;Island of Sifnos&quot;).  <br />&quot;Photocopies&quot; is a stunning example of how a sensitive, perceptive observer can render a vivid image of the world in prose.  In this sense, Berger's collection is a true work of art, a book that I highly recommend not only as entertaining literature, but as a text that merits close reading and careful study by writers and artists.	2002-04-21

The pieces originally appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair. There is nothing really new in this collection, some of the interviews going back nearly thirty years and addressing literary matters that are now of no more than historical interest.<br />Apart from his own writing, Roth has been involved over the years in publishing the work of Eastern European authors. I think, especially, of the numerous books published by Penguin, with Roth's imprimatur, in the \\"Writers from the Other Europe\\" series. I also think of Roth's active support (through PEN and otherwise) of those writers who were, prior to the dissolution of the Soviet monolith, writing under the repression of Eastern Bloc governments. Accordingly, and not surprisingly, the most interesting of the pieces in \\"Shop Talk\\" are the contrapuntal interviews with the Czech authors, Ivan Klima (interviewed in 1990) and Milan Kundera (interviewed in 1980). While these two interviews are, alas, somewhat dated, they do provide interesting insights into the literary-historical struggle that marked writing from that country over the past several decades.<br />\\"Shop Talk\\" also contains interviews with the late Primo Levi (from 1986) and Aharon Appelfeld (from 1988) that provide useful, albeit well-known, insights into the biographical peculiarities that have informed their writing. There are also shorter interviews with the late Isaac Bashevis Singer (from 1976) on the topic of Bruno Schulz (another Eastern European writer) and the Irish writer Edna O'Brien. <br />In addition to the interviews, there are three other pieces. One is a short vignette of Roth's relationship with Bernard Malamud, published shortly after Malamud's death in March of 1986. The second is a similar piece on the artist Philip Guston, who became a friend of Roth's while both lived in Woodstock, New York, in the 1970s. The article contains several whimsical illustrations that Guston gave Roth depicting Roth's character, David Kepesh, the professor who turned into a female breast in Roth's novel \\"The Breast.\\" Last, there is a discussion of the works of Saul Bellow, the most recent of the pieces in this collection (published in The New Yorker in 2000). It is a discussion that can be fully appreciated only if you've read Bellow's works.<br />\\"Shop Talk\\" is, in short, a useful compendium of previous published pieces, albeit a compendium which provides nothing new. It would have benefited, perhaps, from an introductory essay from Roth to place these pieces in perspective.	2002-04-21

Rudolf suffers from sarcoidosis, a disease not described in the narrative, which is characterized by inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, and other tissues. Physically miserable and obsessively fearful of death, he also is a man paralyzed by his misanthropic, conflicted, exhaustingly relentless thoughts. Trapped in his own mind, Rudolf is a literary creation directly descended from Dostoyevsky, Kafka and Beckett.<br />Rudolf has been working for ten years on a biography of Mendelssohn, yet has failed to write even the first line of his work. \\"I had been planning it for ten years and had repeatedly failed to bring it to fruition, but now had resolved to begin writing it on the twenty-seventh of January at precisely four o'clock in the morning, after the departure of my sister.\\" It is an intention to begin writing that recurs again and again throughout Rudolf's narrative, an intention to begin writing at a specific time in a specific location after the completion of specific preparatory tasks. And in each instance, Rudolf fails to begin, a sign of procrastination bred by obsession or of extreme writer's block or of extreme mental imbalance.<br />When Rudolf's sister leaves the house, he still cannot begin to write. Despite her departure, her aura remains: \\"Although she had gone, I still felt the presence of my sister in every part of the house. It would be impossible to imagine a person more hostile to anything intellectual than my sister. The very thought of her robs me of my capacity for any intellectual activity, and she has always stifled at birth any intellectual projects I have had . . . There's no defense against a person like my sister, who is at once so strong and so anti-intellectual; she comes and annihilates whatever has taken shape inone's mind as a result of exerting, indeed of over-exerting one's memory for months on end, whatever it is, even the most trifling sketch on the most trifling subject.\\"<br />This theme, Rudolf's hatred for his older, worldly sister, runs throughout his narrative, the sister becoming one among many reasons (or excuses) for Rudolf's intellectual paralysis, his inability to write, even his inability to function in day-to-day life.<br />But it is not merely his sister that Rudolf despises. He also despises Vienna, the city where he once lived (and where his sister continues to live). \\"Vienna has become a proletarian city through and through, for which no decent person can have anything but scorn and contempt.\\"<br />A complete recluse, his mental world bordering on solipsistic isolation, Rudolf no longer has any interest in social life of any kind. \\"To think that I once not only loved parties,\\" he reflects, \\"but actually gave them and was capable of enjoying them!\\" Now he sees no reason or need for the company of others, for the people Rudolf spent years trying to \\"put right\\" but who only regarded him as a \\"fool\\" for his efforts. As Rudolf thinks, in a long, discursive interior response to his sister's claim that his desolate, morgue-like house, \\"is crying out for society\\":<br />\\"There comes a time when we actually think about these people, and then suddenly we hate them, and so we get rid of them, or they get rid of us; because we see them so clearly all at once, we have to withdraw from their company or they from ours. For years I believed that I couldn't be alone, that I needed all these people, but in fact I don't: I've got on perfectly well without them.\\"<br />Rudolf is isolated in his own mind, a man who cannot accept the imperfections of others and of the world, but also cannot accept his own imperfections. And it is perhaps this, more than anything else, which explains his inability to get along in the world, his inability even to write the first sentence of hisMendelssohn biography. \\"Once, twenty-five years ago, I managed to complete something on Webern in Vienna, but as soon as I completed it I burned it, because it hadn't turned out properly.\\" As Rudolf says, near the end of his short, but exhausting, narrative:<br />\\"I've actually been observing myself for years, if not for decades; my life now consists of self-observation and self-contemplation, which naturally leads to self-condemnation, self-rejection and self-mockery. For years I have lived in this state of self-condemnation, self-abnegation and self-mockery, in which ultimately I always have to take refuge in order to save myself.\\"<br />\\"Concrete\\" leaves the reader exhausted from Rudolf's excessive and relentless narrative, giving truth to the remarkable power of Bernhard's literary imagination and narrative voice.

The woman was twenty-two year old Elizabeth Short, a femme fatale who had moved from Medford, Massachusetts to Southern California as a teenager and lived an itinerant and promiscuous life in post-World War II Hollywood. Her body had been cut in half at the waist and disemboweled. It also showed signs of extreme torture. It was a gruesome murder that caught the undivided attention of the Los Angeles press, particularly the Hearst papers, as well as that of the Los Angeles police and district attorney's office. Quickly dubbed the \\"Black Dahlia\\" murder, the real-life crime remains unsolved to this day and has been a fertile source of books and articles speculating on the perpetrator of this noirish horror.<br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is James Ellroy's fictional re-working of the story, a gritty, graphic and vividly imagined crime novel that marks Ellroy as the finest, and perhaps only, contemporary successor to Chandler, Hammett and Cain. <br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is the first-person, hard-boiled narrative of Bucky Bleichert, a member of the LAPD Warrants Squad at the time of the Black Dahlia murder. Bleichert, and his partner, Lee Blanchard, are both former boxers. They also share the friendship and romantic attention of a young woman named Kay Lake, a woman with intellectual interests and a somewhat checkered past. From this starting point, Ellroy writes a fascinating, complex and cynical tale of how the fascination with the murdered Elizabeth Short-the Black Dahlia-marks the lives of all the books characters (and this book is bursting with characters and motives). <br />Ellroy is brilliant in developing a wide range of realistic characters, in writing and successfully resolving a complex and extraordinarily imagined plot, and in depicting the corrupt and often self-serving underbelly of the LAPD and District Attorney's office in post-World War II Los Angeles. In a tone which suggests the subversive and conspiratorial elements of Don DeLillo's \\"Underworld\\", but written in the starker style of a noir novel, Ellroy uses the real-life story to show the manipulation and corruption that often belies what we read in the popular press and what lives on in the popular imagination. <br />\\"The Black Dahlia\\" is not intended to be a factual accounting of the real-life murder. Rather, it is a fiction that brilliantly uses the real-life murder to develop a vivid (and at times gut-wrenchingly graphic) description of how the lurid fascination with the Black Dahlia became obsessive, fetishistic, in the lives of Ellroy's characters. If you're interested in noir, or even if you're interested in just plain good, hard-boiled crime novels, \\"The Black Dahlia\\" should be at the top of your reading list.	2002-04-21

This big, rich multicultural cacophony of a novel is a brilliant comic narrative that captures the mixture and conflict of races, ethnicities, cultures, and beliefs in London at the millenium. Moreover, unlike other British writers who sometimes seem condescending and unabashedly full of themselves (Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie immediately come to mind), Zadie Smith's writing is full of good humor and prescient insight into the value of even the most disparate life experiences. <br />Smith anchors her story around the unlikely friendship of an easy-going, seemingly unflappable working-class Englishman, Archibald Jones, and a deep-thinking, serious Bengali Muslim waiter, Samad Iqbal. The two first meet inside a tank in the waning days of World War II. They then reunite thirty years later in North London, two unsuccessful middle aged men living out their lives in O'Connell's Poolroom, \\"an Irish poolroom run by Arabs with no pool tables.\\" But while the stories of Archie and Samad anchor the narrative, their relationship is only a small part of this hilarious and deeply insightful novel. <br />Zadie Smith, in reviewing her own novel in the British publication Butterfly, described White Teeth as \\"the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing ten-year-old.\\" The amazing thing is that her description is accurate, for we get not merely the story of the unlikely pair of Archie and Samad, but also many other amusing and intersecting stories, all of them driven by the clash of culture, belief, race, traditon, lineage, and science which forms the turmoil which marks London, and all of the Western world's major cities, at the millenium. We get the story of Archie's young Jamaican wife, Clara, and of Clara's mother, Hortense, a devout and rapturous Jehovah's Witness. We get the story of Samad's turbulent relationship withhis wife, Alsana, as well as Samad's struggle to raise his two twin sons, Millat and Magid, in the face of a materialist culture that pervades and undermines traditionalism of all kinds. We get the story of Marcus and Joyce Chalfen, one a geneticist and the other a pop horticulturist, and their son, Josh. The Chalfens are unstintingly secular, scientific and self-centered celebrants of their own ideology of \\"Chalfenism\\". Finally, we get the story of Irie, the awkward daughter of Archie and Clara, who winds through the novel, its characters and situations, searching for an identity in the tangled history of her Jamaican past and the crowded cultural stew of her North London present. <br />In Smith's words, capturing the essence of her novel in a couple of sentences: \\"It is only this late in the day that you can walk into a playground and find Isaac Leung by the fish pond, Danny Rahman in the football cage, Quang O'Rourke bouncing a basketball and Irie Jones humming a tune. Children with first and last names on a direct collision course.\\" <br />While Smith's narrative energy dissipates somewhat during that latter part of the novel, \\"White Teeth\\" is still the best first novel to be published in a long time.  Read it, enjoy it and look forward to many more novels from this brilliantly funny young author.	2002-04-18

The moment lives starkly in Lol's memory, even after she's been married for ten years, after she's had three children, after she should have moved on with her life. The memory endures until it can be revised, until Lol can make a new memory to replace it.<br />Tatiana Karl, Lol's best friend in childhood, was with Lol the night her fiance left her. He did it publicly, at a prominent dance in the Town Beach casino, while Lol and Tatiana watched. Lol collapses in a state of depression, becomes uncommunicative, changes. She is brought back to South Tahla, the place of her birth, to recover. It is here that she meets John Bedford, marries him and seemingly moves on with her life, literally leaving South Tahla, as well, for ten years and breaking off all contact with old friends, including Tatiana. But the memory lingers, darkly, and can only be erased when Lol and her husband return to South Tahla, return to the place where the memory was made.<br />Lol works at erasing the mental trauma of her past with a new memory, a memory wrought from obsession, voyeurism, and calculated seduction. She resumes her relationship with Tatiana, now married, and makes a new relationship with Tatiana's lover. Haunting and erotically charged, marked by a disturbing psychological aridity, and written in a complex, non-linear style marked by the shifting viewpoint of its narrator, &quot;The Ravishing of Lol Stein&quot; is another example of why Marguerite Duras deserves to be ranked as one of the finest writers of Twentieth century literature.	2002-04-18

But while this big, baggy eight-hundred page monstrosity of comic characters and situations may lack a hero, it has two of the most memorable characters in English literature: Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp. The contrapuntal, shifting fortunes of these two women drive the narrative of this big book, painting, along the way, a brilliant satirical portrait of English and European society at the time of the Napoleonic wars. <br />We first meet Amelia and Becky in the opening pages of the novel, leaving Miss Pinkerton's School for the wider world of fortune, love and marriage. Amelia Sedley, the naive, sheltered daughter of a rich London merchant whose fortunes will dramatically change over the course of her life, &quot;was a dear little creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a person.&quot; In contrast, Becky Sharp, the impoverished orphan of an artist and a French opera singer of dubious repute, was a calculating, amoral social climber. &quot;Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind or placable . . . but she had the dismal precocity of poverty.&quot; <br />From the opening pages, Thackeray captures the reader's interest in these two characters and carries the reader through marriages, births, deaths, poverty, misfortune, social climbing . . . even the Battle of Waterloo! While Amelia and Becky wind like a long, contrasting thread from the beginning to the end of this story, there are also plots and subplots, intrigues and authorial asides, and one character after another, all of this literary invention keeping the reader incessantly preoccupied and enthralled. Reading &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is the furthest thing from &quot;killing time&quot; (as the dusty, misguided literary critic F. R. Leavis once said); it is, rather, the epitome of the nineteenth century English comic novel, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.	2002-04-18

Like other works of Marguerite Duras, \\"The Lover\\" conflates a vivid and deeply sensuous literary imagination with thinly-veiled autobiographical elements and a non-linear, ever shifting perspective. The result is a short, powerful novel of memory and erotic yearning. a novel which lingers in the reader's mind long after the last page.<br />Neither the girl nor her Chinese lover has a name. The girl meets the Chinese lover on a ferry, seeing him in a limousine while she is returning to boarding school in Saigon. She is wearing a flat brimmed fedora hat, a silk dress turned sepia-toned with age, and gold lame high heels. She is a girl who is accustomed to people looking at her. \\"People do look at white women in the colonies; at twelve-year-old white girls too. For the past three years white men, too, have been looking at me in the streets, and my mother's men friends have been kindly asking me to have tea with them while their wives are out playing tennis.\\"<br />Each is a starkly drawn character acting in ways that seem predestined. The Chinese lover does not intend to marry her, only to be her lover. The girl surrenders to what seems her fate. \\"She agreed to come as soon as he asked her the previous evening. She's where she has to be, placed here. She feels a tinge of fear. It's as if this must be not only what she expects, but also what had to happen especially to her. She says, I'd rather you didn't love me. But if you do, I'd like you to do as you usually do with women.\\" <br />It is a deeply moving erotic tale. It is also a tale of the girl's troubled life, of her strained relationships with her mother and her two brothers, and the way those relationships color her affair. Her mother speaks of \\"blatant prostitution and laughsat the scandal.\\" And in her elder brother's presence, the Chinese man \\"ceases to be [her] lover.\\" \\"He doesn't cease to exist, but he's no longer anything to me. He becomes a burnt-out shell.\\" <br />Written in one short paragraph after another, moving back and forth in time, ever changing its narrative locus, \\"The Lover\\" paints a fictional world of eroticism, longing and memory. The result is a compelling work of fiction, nothing less than a minor masterpiece of Twentieth century French literature.	2002-04-18

I picked up Thomas Disch's &quot;The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of&quot; primarily because I had read and immensely enjoyed &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot;, his superb collection of essays on &quot;poetry, poets and poetasters&quot;. I also was aware of Disch's reputation as a &quot;literary&quot; writer of science fiction, an author who reputedly stood above the pulpy cauldron of a genre often castigated as &quot;low brow&quot;, and was interested in his opinion of the significance of science fiction-a significance which is strongly suggested by the subtitle of this book: &quot;How Science Fiction Conquered the World&quot;<br />&quot;The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of&quot; is a wide ranging, opinionated romp through science fiction, a book which keeps you turning the pages with an avidity more typical of a horror or suspense novel. Beginning with the claim that science fiction is, at its root, an American genre that originated with Edgar Allen Poe (&quot;our embarrassing ancestor&quot;), Disch propels the reader through nearly two centuries of writing, showing how science fiction has been able to combine genuine visionary power with the most irrational, &quot;lumpen-literature&quot; characteristics of the black-print-screaming tabloid headlines about UFO abductees. In chapter after chapter, Disch renders strong opinions and insightful observations on how science fiction has evolved over the years, how that evolution has affected our view of the world and its possible futures, and how science fiction has been able to appropriate and define political, religious and social perspectives on the world. Along the way, Disch takes on feminism (&quot;Can Girls Play Too? Feminizing Science Fiction&quot;), Republicans (&quot;Republicans on Mars-Science Fiction as Military Strategy&quot;), and, not surprisingly, the unmitigated xenophobic need for an &quot;other&quot; (&quot;The Third World and Other Alien Nations&quot;). <br />The most compelling thing about &quot;The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of&quot;, however, is that it makes you want to sit down and read some of these science fiction writers-at least if you're like me, and haven't already.	2002-04-18
US	49563640	RIET72UYJ1MXE	0375709118	373068284	In the Pond	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Another Little Gem from Ha Jin	Ha Jin won the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner award in 1999 for his second novel, \\"Waiting\\". He just as easily could have won the award for his first novel, \\"In the Pond\\", an equally stunning tale of life in China during the Cultural Revolution. Set in Dismount Fort (a locale that Jin has explored in other stories, notably in his fine collection, \\"Under the Red Flag\\", which won the 1997 Flannery O'Connor Award), \\"In the Pond\\" is a sparely written, profoundly witty and insightful tale of Shao Bin and his struggle for just treatment by Secretary Liu and Director Ma, the Party leaders who dominate his work and life. <br />A worker in the Harvest Fertilizer Plant by day, Shao Bin is a remarkably talented and creative artist by night, a self-educated and self-styled intellectual whose talent goes unrecognized by Liu and Ma. When Shao Bin and his wife, Meilan, and their young infant daugher are passed over for a decent apartment because Shao Bin refuses to make gifts and payments to his bosses, he begins a campaign of satirical cartoons and attacks on the corruption of Liu and Ma. Liu and Ma, in turn, mercilessly persecute and humiliate Shao Bin. The result is a seemingly endless series of attacks and counterattacks, thrusts and parries. Each time, Shao Bin succeeds in escalating the struggle to another level, his lonely battle against the local Party bosses eventually widening to the highest levels of the Party. <br />Like the humble lives of his characters, Ha Jin's prose once again sparkles in its simplicty and purity. And like human nature everywhere, Ha Jin's narrative wittily captures the pettiness, the foibles, which often motivate day-to-day behavior. In Shao Bin, Ha Jin has created an irrepressible and deeply human hero. Like his other work, \\"In the Pond\\" is another little gem of English prose, another simple tale of what it's like to be human.	2002-04-18

The stories, set in China at various times during the Cultural Revolution, were remarkable for their crystalline pure prose, realistic attention to detail and depiction of the intersection of the personal and the political in the quotidian lives of their characters. From that first reading, Ha Jin struck me as perhaps the finest prose stylist writing in English today. <br />Ironically, Ha Jin was illiterate in his own Chinese language until his mid-teens, when he began reading voraciously while serving in the Chinese army on the Russian border. It was not until the age of twenty that Jin began studying English and, twelve years later, in 1988, began writing in English. By that time, Jin had completed graduate study at Brandeis University and, in the wake of the events at Tiananmen Square, emigrated to the United States. While Ha Jin's prose is remarkable for its austere beauty, and his themes are universal and set in the ordinary, everyday lives of his characters, the setting of his fictions remains exclusively and particularly Chinese. <br />&quot;Waiting&quot;, Ha Jin's second novel, tells the story of an eighteen year love triangle among Lin Kong, a doctor in Muji City, his loyal, but illiterate wife, Shuyu, and his educated and urbane mistress, the nurse Manna Wu. Kong lives and works apart from his wife, in a hospital in Muji City, where he meets Manna Wu. Each year, for eighteen years, Kong returns to the country to visit his wife and to request a divorce so he can marry Manna Wu. Each year Kong's wife, whose bound feet are a sign of her rural backwardness, refuses to consent to his request. It is a simple story told in simple prose. Set during a period from the early 1960s until the 1980s, &quot;Waiting&quot; is a realistic and human tale of relationships set against the backdrop of Chinese culture and society during the years of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. Marked by Ha Jin's remarkable attention to the details of everyday life, &quot;Waiting&quot; is a sparkling gem of a novel, a deserving winner of both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award.	2002-04-18

I had just arrived in Ireland for a year of study and picked up an inexpensive Picador paperback edition of his first collection of stories, \\"First Love, Last Rites.\\" I still have that paperback, its pages dog-eared and fragile, and I re-read it from time-to-time. After that first encounter, I became a McEwan \\"fan,\\" enraptured by his dark, edgy, disturbing, psychologically obsessive narratives. <br />\\"Enduring Love\\", published more than twenty years after that first collection of stories, is different from his earliest writing in the sense that its narrative turns around a more conventional, albeit still psychologically driven and bizarre, set of circumstances. <br />As many reviewers have commented, the first chapter of \\"Enduring Love\\" is a compelling page-turner. Joe and Clarissa, long-time lovers, are setting up a picnic under a tree on the edge of a wide expanse of field. Clarissa, a Keats scholar, has just returned from an extended research trip to Rome and the picnic is an occasion for them to celebrate their reunion. In Joe's first person narrative: \\"The beginning is simple to mark. We were in sunlight under a turkey oak, partly protected from a strong, gusty wind. I was kneeling on the grass with a corkscrew in my hand, and Clarissa was passing me the bottle-a 1987 Daumas Gassac. This was the moment, this was the pinprick on the time map: I was stretching out my hand, and as the cool neck and the black foil touched my palm, we heard a man's shout. We turned and looked across the field and saw the danger.\\"<br />And what was the danger? Joe and Clarissa see a hot air balloon pulling away from the ground, a young boy in the basket of the balloon while an older man, his companion, struggles desperately to hold onto the balloon, to keep it tethered to the ground in the face of gusty winds. <br />Soon, Joe is running across the field to help, along with three other men. It is a moment in time, \\"the pinprick on the time map,\\" that Joe explores obsessively, examining it, turning it, over and over, trying to understand how such an instant can change an entire life. <br />Joe and the three other men soon catch up to the balloon, the four of them, together with the boy's older companion, struggling to hold the balloon down, to keep it from blowing off with the young boy as scared passenger. It becomes apparent, however, that their efforts are failing, the balloon starting to rise higher, the four men holding on, each of them facing grave physical danger and a powerful moral dilemma. Each must decide whether to continue to hold on, running the risk that if the others do not then he will face near certain death from falling. As Joe later relates, looking back on that moment, \\"I didn't know, nor have I ever discovered, who let go first. I am not prepared to accept that it was me. What is certain is that if we had not broken ranks, our collective weight would have brought the balloon to earth a few seconds later as the gust subsided.\\"<br />Thus begins \\"Enduring Love\\", the first chapter seemingly narrating an event and a moral conundrum that immediately captures the reader, leading him to believe that the rest of the novel will explore how this event affects the lives of Joe and Clarissa and the rest of the book's characters. However, in typical McEwan fashion, the plot takes a much different turn. What begins as a tragic event that elicits moral ponderings veers into a narrative of science, religion and psychological obsession. <br />Joe Rose encounters one of the other would-be rescuers, Jed Parry, while standing in the field after their ill-starred rescue attempt. Parry, an apparently religious fanatic, sees deep meaning in his time-bound encounter with Joe. He becomes obsessed with Joe, stalking him and, eventually, threatening Joe's relationship with Clarissa and Joe's very well-being. Parry suffers from de Clerambault's syndrome, a type of homo-erotic obsession with religious overtones. As the scientific appendix to the novel notes, \\"this is indeed a most lasting form of love, often terminated only by the death of the patient.\\"<br />\\"Enduring Love\\" thus begins by posing a moral dilemma, but soon evolves into a compelling novel of deviant psychological obsession, of conflict between religion and science, and of a deep, introspective examination of how a loving relationship can soon unravel in the face of threats from the outside. It is a thought-provoking novel, albeit one which at times seems somewhat lacking in feeling, the reader (at least this reader) having difficulty identifying with the often clinical coldness of Joe's first person narration. While the tone of Joe's narration may be intentional, McEwan intending to write in a voice that reflects the unfeeling tone of Joe's deep-seated scientific rationalism, the narrative never quite rings true to life. \\"Enduring Love\\" is, nonetheless, a fascinating and worthwhile novel that gives the reader much to ponder.	2002-04-18

Symons and Christopher Millard, each somewhat obscure and eccentric literary figures in their own right, were sitting in a garden discussing books and authors that had never received proper recognition from the arbiters of literary history. Millard asked Symons whether he had ever read \\"Hadrian the Seventh.\\" Symons acknowledged that he had not and that he was unfamiliar with the book. \\"To my surprise, [Millard] offered to lend me his copy-to my surprise, for my companion lent his books seldom and reluctantly. But knowing the range of his knowledge of out-of-the-way literature, I accepted without hesitating; and by doing so took the first step on a trail that led into very strange places.\\"<br />Very strange places indeed! Symons began reading \\"Hadrian the Seventh,\\" a book written by Frederick Rolfe, also known as Baron Corvo, and originally published in 1904, and quickly felt \\"that interior stir with which we all recognize a transforming new experience.\\" Symons went on to spend the next eight years of his life tracking down the details of the life and writings of Baron Corvo, one of the most eccentric, original and enigmatic English writers of the last one hundred years. The result was \\"The Quest for Corvo: An Experimental Biography,\\" a fascinating book that has been in- and out-of-print since its first publication in 1934 and has enjoyed a literary cult following akin to that of the text (\\"Hadrian the Seventh\\") and the author (Rolfe, aka Corvo) that originally inspired it. <br />As one reads \\"The Quest for Corvo,\\" it seems that Symon's text represents the outermost of three concentric circles of eccentricity. <br />The innermost, core circle is \\"Hadrian the Seventh,\\" a strange and imaginative novel that tells the story of an impoverished, eccentric and seemingly paranoid writer and devotee of the Roman Catholic faith, George Arthur Rose. Rose, a brilliant, self-taught man whose candidacy for the priesthood had been rejected twenty years earlier, is unexpectedly approached one day by a Cardinal and a Bishop who have been made aware of his devotion and his shameful treatment by the Church. Rose is ordained and ultimately becomes the first English Pope in several hundred years. While a work of fiction, Symons' biographical investigations disclose that much of the story of \\"Hadrian the Seventh\\" closely parallels the life of its strange author, Frederick Rolfe. <br />The second circle of eccentricity is, of course, the life of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo, himself. It is the telling of this life that occupies Symons in \\"The Quest for Corvo,\\" and the result is a fascinating, if perhaps not always historically accurate, detective story cum biography. Starting with his obsessive search for information on Rolfe and his meetings and correspondence with those who knew him, Symons brilliantly recreates a life-the life of a strangely talented artist, photographer, historian, and writer who led a life of seemingly paranoid desperation, ultimately dying impoverished in Venice at the age of forty-five.<br />The third, outermost circle is the eccentricity of the author of the \\"Quest for Corvo,\\" A. J. A. Symons, a founder of The Wine and Food Society of England, a collector of music boxes, and a master at card tricks and the art of forgery. Like Corvo himself, Symons died at an early age-he was only forty years old-and his life and his book is seemingly as eccentric as its subject.<br />\\"The Quest for Corvo\\" is one of those little gems that deserve a cherished, if perhaps minor, place in English literature and the literature of biography. Happily, it is back in print again, courtesy of New York Review Books. Read it, and then read \\"Hadrian the Fourth\\" (also brought back into print by NYRB) for a fascinating turn in the world of the imaginative and the eccentric.	2002-04-18

Di Piero, in his introduction to Leonardo Sciascia's \\"To Each His Own,\\" aptly comments that Sciascia \\"used storytelling as in instrument for investigating and attacking the ethos of a culture-the insular, mafia-saturated culture of Sicily-which he believed to be a metaphor for the world.\\" He did this as a political journalist, as a short story writer (notably in his fine collection, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" which I also have reviewed here at Amazon) and, perhaps most effectively, as a writer of a unique type of detective story, one in which the usual investigation and solution of a crime is occluded by the lie, the secret, the collusion, and the murder that seemingly pervade Sciasica's Sicily.<BR> <br />In \\"To Each His Own,\\" a pharmacist receives a simple, threatening and anonymous letter: \\"This letter is your death sentence. To avenge what you have done, you will die.\\" The threat is apparently soon carried out, for a few days later the pharmacist and a close friend, Dr. Roscio, are found murdered. The two men had been hunting and their pack of dogs returned to the town without the men, prompting much speculation and a typically Sciascian commentary on the Sicilian code of silence:<br />\\"The return of the dogs set the whole town to disputing for days and days (as will always happen when people discuss the nature of dogs) about the order of Creation, since it is not at all fair that dogs should lack the gift of speech. No account was taken, in the creator's defense, that even had they had the gift of speech, the dogs would, in the given circumstances, have become so many mutes both with regard to the identity of the murderers and in testifying before the marshal of the carabinieri.\\" <br />From this point forward, \\"To Each His Own\\" narrates the personal investigation of the crime by Professor Laurana... a high school teacher who lives alone with his mother in the same house he has lived in all his life. Professor Laurana undertakes the investigation not because he really cares to bring the perpetrator to justice, but \\"rather like the man in a living room or club who hears one of those stupid puzzles volunteered by the fools who are always eager to propose and, what is worse, to solve them, and who knows that it is a futile game and a waste of time, yet who feels obliged to solve the problem, and doggedly sets about doing so.\\"<br />Professor Laurana methodically follows the clues and, along the way, provides a narrative that illuminates the corruption, the secrecy, the complicity, and the silence that make any effort to bring a criminal to justice in Sicily \\"a futile game and a waste of time.\\" It is a narrative sharply critical of every institution in society-the Government, the Police, the Church, the Family-and laden with commentary and erotically charged innuendo on the relationship between men and women in a patriarchal... if not misogynistic, culture. \\"To Each His Own\\" is, ultimately, a tale that ends grimly for those who seek the truth, even as the perpetrators celebrate their crimes in Sciascia's cynical Sicilian world.	2002-04-16

Four years later \\"The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake\\" was published, a collection of twelve stories that posthumously established his literary reputation as one of the finest short story writers in twentieth century American literature.<br />Pancake grew up in the hollows of West Virginia and each of the carefully wrought stories in this collection deals with the seemingly desperate lives of the working poor in that part of the country. They are remarkably crafted stories, written with a deep sense for the locale and the people from which they are drawn. They are also models of precision, the kind of stories that deserve to be read over and over, studied for the way in which they use foregrounding and the mundane details of everyday life--albeit everyday life that quietly screams with the desperation of poverty, deadening work, drinking, promiscuity, and brutality-to draw complex portraits of people who endure, even when endurance is no more than a substitute for hope. As he writes in \\"A Room Forever,\\" the story of a tugboat mate spending New Year's Eve in an eight-dollar-a-night hotel room where he drinks cheap whiskey out of the bottle and eventually ends up with a teen-aged prostitute: \\"I stop in front of a bus station, look in on the waiting people, and think about all the places they are going. But I know they can't run away from it or drink their way out of it or die to get rid of it. It's always there.\\"<br />The best of these stories are \\"Trilobites,\\" \\"The Honored Dead,\\" \\"Fox Hunters,\\" and \\"In the Dry.\\" But there really isn't a weak story in the bunch. Every story is captivating, every one an exemplar of what good short story writing should be. At the end, the only thing that disappoints, that leaves the reader discomforted, is the thought that Pancakedied so young, that these are the only stories we have by a truly remarkable writer.	2002-04-16

Schiele was a draftsman and printmaker, but was best known as a painter. He entered the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts at the tender age of sixteen and soon became a student of August Klimt, the most well known Austrian painter of that time. As one of the preeminent artists associated with Austrian expressionism, Schiele's paintings are transgressive depictions of contorted, erotically charged nude figures, often in provocative sexual poses and often including young girls. Not surprisingly, Schiele's art was controversial. Moreover, his use of adolescent girls as models for his drawings and paintings led to numerous charges of immorality. Often, this simply meant he had to move from one small Austrian town to another, hounded by the wrath of common people who viewed him as morally repugnant. However, in one case, Schiele was prosecuted and spent time in prison for his averred transgressions.<br />\\"Arrogance\\" is Joanna Scott's fictional account of Schiele's life, a parallax narrative that tells its tale from a series of changing and different perspectives. Nominated for the 1991 PEN/Faulkner Award (which, regrettably, it did not win), it subsequently earned Scott a MacArthur Fellowship for her presumed literary genius. While not a novel for readers who prefer straightforward, linear narratives, \\"Arrogance\\" is nonetheless a penetrating fictional exploration of Schiele's artistic genius as related not only from the facts of his life, but also from the imaginary inner world of the artist and those around him, including his long-time female companion, Vallie Neuzil, and a fictional female narrator who tells of her fascination and involvement with Schiele and Vallie during their residence in the small Austrian village of Neulengbach, where Schiele was arrested for corruption of minors.<br />\\"Arrogance\\" is a vivid and convincing portrait of the life and mind of the artist, a complex narrative that challenge the reader to understand and interpret that life from multiple perspectives, both biographical and imaginative. It is, in short, a brilliant example of how fiction and imagination can inform biography, how literature can be written to illuminate and inform the real.	2002-04-16

Written by a young, white American male in the late Twentieth century, it brilliantly depicts the life of a geisha in Japan during the 1930s and 1940s. The novel has been appropriately described by one reviewer as an act of ventriloquism because of the author's ability to get inside the mind of the book's female protagonist and write a novel of sustained versimilitude and historical and cultural accuracy. The achievement is even more notable when you realize that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is Golden's first published novel.<br />\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" tells the story of Chiyo, the poor daughter of an elderly fisherman and his dying wife. When Chiyo is eight years old, she and her older sister, Satsu, are sold by their father, both designated to become geisha in Kyoto. While Satsu is unremarkable and she ends up as a common prostitute, Chiyo's striking eyes, diminutive beauty and resilient intelligence make her a suitable geisha in training. She soon finds herself in conflict, however, with the resident geisha in her house, Hatsumomo, a beautiful and mean-spirited woman whose antagonism runs through the novel like a thread. <br />Hatsumomo makes life unbearable for Chiyo and seemingly destroys her future until she is taken under the wing of Mameha, a beautiful and accomplished geisha whose motives are uncertain. Through the efforts of Mameha, Chiyo becomes a succesful and avidly sought geisha, taking the name Suriya and becoming the favorite of a war-maimed, wealthy patron named Noru. All this time, however, Suriya's romantic obsession is a business partner and deeply-indebted friend of Noru, a man simply known as the \\"Chairman\\", a man who had once been kind to the young Chiyo when he found her crying by a stream. <br />\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is, thus, an historical romance set in Japan during the Depression and the years during and following World War II. As a romance, it is a somewhat lacking because of its fairy tale quality, its unbelievability, its departure from realism. However, while its romantic aspects fall short, it is remarkably successful in depicting the geisha culture of the period--the extensive training of the geisha, the incredible physical and mental demands of the geisha profession, the cultural milieu, trappings, beliefs, and superstitions of the geisha in day-to-day life, and the place of the geisha in Japanese society. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is also remarkable for the way its author succeeds in imagining, and expressing, the intimate life and thoughts of the young Chiyo and the mature geisha Suriya.<br />While \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" does not rise to the level of classic status and can, at times, be somewhat tedious, it is a remarkably well written and imagined first novel, a stunning and sympathetic fictional portrayal of an aspect of Japanese culture that is often misunderstood in the West.	2002-04-16

It is, first and foremost, the epistolary narrative of Anne Winterbourne, an English widow who moves to Egypt, falls in love with, and ultimately marries, the Egyptian lawyer and political activist Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi in 1901. It is also the story of Isabel Parkman, the great granddaughter of Anne and Sharif, a thirty-five-year old American divorcee who, like her great grandmother before her, falls in love in 1997 with Omar, a brilliant, self-centered and much older Egyptian conductor and political activist for the Palestinian cause. <br />The stories of these two romances are largely told by Omar's sister, Amal, herself a woman who has had her own failed marriage and two grown children who she no longer sees. Given a trunk full of Anne Winterbourne's letters by Isabel, who finds them when her dying mother enters the hospital, Amal soon becomes obsessed with writing the story of Anne Winterbourne, in the process also becoming the confidant of the Isabel and her passionate obsession for Omar. <br />\\"The Map of Love\\" weaves an intricate and powerful narrative, spanning time, geography and culture, providing a remarkable picture of Egyptian history and politics as it confronts the British colonialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and its legacy nearly a century later. If the book has a shortcoming, it is in the relative weakness of the story of Isabel and Omar, a romance that never quite grips the reader. It is a shortcoming which is perhaps more apparent because the epistolary tale, the tale of the life of Anne Winterbourne and Sharif Pasha, is brilliantly wrought, a romantic narrative with true feeling and verisimilitude. \\"The Map of Love\\" should be read slowly and savored, preferably on a warm beach near the sea on a long summer's vacation.	2002-04-16

There is Sir Francis Hinsley, an aging Englishman who, when he first arrived in America more than twenty years earlier was the only knight in Hollywood, President of the Cricket Club and chief screenwriter at Megalopolitan Pictures. Now in decline, he no longer reads, writes or does much of anything except sit in a rocker, read a tawdry magazine or two, and drink whiskey and soda. He lives with the much younger English expatriate, Dennis Barlow, a poet whose one literary success earned him an invitation to Hollywood where his screenwriting career quickly dissipated. Barlow now works at the Happier Hunting Ground pet cemetery, an embarrassment to his English colleagues in Hollywood. As the actor Sir Ambrose Ambercrombie tells young Barlow, in a sort of recasting of the White Man's Burden in a thoroughly modern context:<br />&quot;We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow. They may laugh at us a bit-the way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles-they may think us cliquey and stand-offish, but, by God, they respect us. Your five-to-two is a judge of quality. He knows what he's buying and it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here. I often feel like an ambassador Barlow. It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here shares it. We can't be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility. You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs-except in England, of course. That's understood out here, thanks to the example we've set. There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.&quot;<br />The stage thus set, &quot;The Loved One&quot; soon takes off into a dark comic narrative of the American funeral industry. Sir Francis, no longer wanted by Megalopolitan Pictures, is turned out of his office and shunned. Young Barlow returns home to find that Sir Francis, in despair, has hanged himself. Appropriate funeral arrangements must be made.<br />Barlow then embarks upon his adventure in the funeral industry, making arrangements at Whispering Glades, a full-service funeral establishment and cemetery for Hollywood's rich and famous:<br />&quot;Times without number since he first came to Hollywood he had heard the name of that great necropolis on the lips of others; he had read it in the local newssheets when some more than usually illustrious body was given more than usually splendid honours or some new acquisition was made to its collected masterpieces of contemporary art. Of recent weeks his interest had been livelier and more technical because it was in humble emulation of its great neighbor that the Happier Hunting Ground was planned. The language he daily spoke in his new trade was a patois derived from that high pure source. . . . As a missionary priest making his first visit to the Vatican, as a paramount chief of Equatorial Africa mounting the Eiffel Tower, Dennis Barlow, poet and pets' mortician drove through the Golden Gates.&quot;<br />In a brilliant comic chapter, Barlow meets first the Mortuary Hostess, who explores burial options with him:<br />&quot;Embalmment, of course, and after that incineration or not, according to taste. Our crematory is on scientific principles, the heat is so intense that all inessentials are volatilized. Some people did not like the thought that ashes of the casket and clothing were mixed with the Loved One's. Normal disposal is by inhumement, entombment, inurement or immurement, but lately many people just lately prefer insarcophagusment. . . . That, of course, is for those for whomprice is not the primary consideration.&quot;<br />After choosing a burial option, there is the matter of selecting appropriate garb for the deceased, viewing the various slumber rooms for Sir Francis' wake, and selecting a burial site in Whispering Glades. As the Hostess explains: &quot;The Park is zoned. Each zone has its own name and appropriate Work of Art. Zones of course vary in price and within the zones the prices vary according to the proximity to the Work of Art.&quot; And the Park is, of course, restricted to Caucasians: &quot;The Dreamer has made that rule for the sake of the Waiting Ones. In their time of trial they prefer to be with their own people.&quot; <br />Barlow then moves on to the Funeral Director, who, in a brilliant passage of dark comic wit, explains the benefits of Before Need Arrangements to Barlow, trying to sell him on the need for making his own funeral arrangements while he's young. <br />Finally, young Barlow is introduced to the mortuary cosmetician, Aimee Thanatogenos, and the embalmer, Mr. Joyboy. It is here that the real plot begins, for the second half of &quot;The Loved One&quot; brilliantly narrates an offbeat love triangle among Barlow, Aimee and Joyboy that ends in a darkly comic way that only Waugh could imagine. <br />&quot;The Loved One&quot; is a short, brilliant, dark, and funny comic novel that represents Waugh at his best. Read and enjoy!	2002-04-16

It is this position which ultimately defines Pamuk's writing, and \\"The White Castle\\", a novel originally published in Turkey nearly twenty years ago and translated into English in the past decade, represents a kind of \\"locus classicus\\" of the Pamukian literary project.<br />\\"The White Castle\\" is a story contained in a manuscript found by Faruk Darvinoglu in 1982 in a long forgotten archive of the Turkish governor's office in Gebze. The manuscript, written in the first person, narrates the tale of a young, educated Venetian who is sailing from Venice to Naples in the seventeenth century. His ship is attacked and captured by Turkish ships and the young Italian is carried off to Istanbul, where he becomes the slave of a man named Hoja. Hoja, an advisor to sultans and pashas, is physically identical to the young Italian. Hoja, too, is highly educated-at least by the standards of his time and place-and he seeks to learn from the Italian everything the Italian knows about the literature, science, technology, and art of the West. <br />Over the course of time, the Venetian and Hoja becomeindistinguishable, not only in their appearance, but in their thoughts and actions. They collaborate on a number of projects together for the Turkish sultan, the last being the development of a war machine for use in an ill-fated war against the Poles and their Western allies. Using the machine to lay siege to the white castle of the book's title, the the two men ultimately recognize, in the shadow of that castle, that all that they had \\"experienced for years as coincidence had been inevitable.\\" It is then, in the face of certain failure, that they appear to exchange identities-Hoja fleeing to Italy and assuming the identity of his slave and the slave, in turn, assuming the identity and place of his former master. Or do they? In the enigmatic and occluded narration of \\"The White Castle\\", the reader is left as uncertain of the identities of the two men as the Italian and the Turk are of their own confused identities.<br />\\"The White Castle\\" is a powerful, hypnotic, richly imagined book which plays on the notions of identity and cultural difference, on the meeting of East and West, on the sometimes seemingly indeterminate place of Turkey in the geography of the world-and of the mind. It is, in other words, a book worth reading by an author who deservedly merits all the recognition he has gotten in his native Turkey, as well as in the West.	2002-04-16

While less well know in the United States than some of his Italian contemporaries-I think here of Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, Umberto Eco-Sciascia enjoys a well deserved reputation in Italy as a writer of novels, stories and political commentary.<br />Sciascia was a Sicilian. This fact, more than any other, colors all of the stories in this collection. Each of these stories reflects, in some way, the particularities of Sicilian culture and society. There is, of course, the uneasy and often conflicting relationship that Sicily has had with the rest of Italy, particularly the northern part of that country. There is also the pervasive influence of the Mafia on Sicilian life, particularly the strong notions of honor and \\"omerta,\\" the Mafia code of silence. And there is, finally, the interplay of the tightly knit Sicilian family, the Roman Catholic Church and the Italian state. <br />The best of the stories in this collection are marked by subdued irony, subtle wit and steely-clear insight into the idiosyncrasies that mark Sicilian life within the larger context of Italy. <br />In \\"A Matter of Conscience,\\" a Sicilian lawyer traveling back home from Rome picks up a women's magazine on the train. He reads an anonymous letter to a priest, written by a woman from his hometown, asking for advice. The woman had an affair with a relative for six months, is tormented by her adultery and wants to know whether she should tell her husband. She relates that, \\"as a very devout person, I have confessed my fault on several different occasions.\\" She then goes on-drawing the distinction between her Sicilian mores and those of the rest of Italy-as follows: \\"Every priest except one (but he was a northerner) has told me that if my repentance is sincere, and my love for my husband unchanged, then I must remain silent.\\" From here, the story turns into a witty, ironic exploration of lifein the lawyer's town as each of his colleagues becomes obsessed with the thought that he is the cuckold.<br />In \\"Mafia Western,\\" a big town \\"on the border between the provinces of Palermo and Trapani\\" is embroiled in a bloody battle between two feuding mafia cells. It is at the time of World War I and, \\"the death-toll from assassination [is] comparable to the death-toll of its citizens falling at the front.\\" In dry, matter-of-fact style, Sciascia relates this fictional tale, the interstices of his story relating the society within the society-the society of the mafiosi, the capo and the code of silence. Thus, a mother's son is killed and she knows his assassin. But she remains silent, picking up her son's body and bringing it back home. \\"The next morning she let it be know that her son died of a wound there upon his bed, but she knew neither where nor by whom he had been wounded. No word did she utter to the carabinieri about the man who might have killed him. But her friends understood-they knew-and they now set about very careful preparations.\\"<br />In \\"Philology,\\" two men that are to be called before the Commission of Enquiry investigating the activities of the mafia in Sicily engage in an ironic, witty discourse on the origin and meaning of the word \\"mafia\\". They are doing this in preparation for their interrogation, their dialogue a bit of dry, absurd humor that conflates the high intellectual pretension of philological discourse with the pragmatic, cold-blooded realities that underlie their preparations. As one of them says, \\"the fact is that everyone tries to establish the current meaning of the word before establishing its origin.\\" After exploring possible Arabic and French origins of the word, and the deficiencies in education of the general public, who misunderstand the importance of etymology and meaning, he ultimately presents an ironically pragmatic, if high-sounding, statement of the meaning of the word \\"mafia\\": \\"Mafia implies a consciousness of self,an exaggerated concept of the power of the individual as sole arbiter of every conflict of interests or ideas; from this derives the inability to bear with the superiority, and even more, the authority of others. The mafioso expects respect and nearly always offers it. When crossed, he does not appeal to the law, public justice, but takes matters into his own hands and, should the remedy be beyond his own power, he will call on the assistance of like-minded friends.\\"<br />\\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" the longest of the stories in this collection, wonderfully depicts the cultural separation between Sicilians and other Italians. In this story, Bianchi, an engineer traveling to Sicily for the first time, shares a compartment with a Sicilian family and \\"a girl of about twenty-three\\" who is attached to the family \\"by ties of family, friendship or casual acquaintance.\\" Over the course of their long train ride, Bianchi, if only briefly, manages to penetrate the seemingly deep cultural divide between him and the family, along the way also sharing a fleeting romantic connection with the young girl.<br />These are only some of the stories in this collection. There are others that are equally good. In particular, I think of \\"Demotion\\" (which provides a fascinating contrapuntal theme of Catholicism and Communism, Saint Filomena and Joseph Stalin) and \\"The Ransom\\" (which retells a popular Sicilian folk tale of familial duty, love and betrayal). With the exception of \\"Apocryphal Correspondence re Crowley,\\" which, at best, is of nothing more than historical interest and utterly unremarkable, \\"The Wine-Dark Sea\\" is an exceptionally good collection of stories and a wonderful introduction to an Italian writer that, thus far, has been little read in the United States.	2002-04-16
US	49563640	R1AI84U2LNOR9A	0880011459	931251517	Notebook of Anton Chekhov (English and Russian Edition)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Glimmer of Insight into the Master of the Short Story	In 1984, The Ecco Press published a handsome thirteen-volume edition of The Tales of Chekhov that contained the respected, if somewhat dated, English translations of Constance Garnett. The original thirteen volumes were subsequently supplemented by two additional volumes, &quot;The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings,&quot; translated by Avrahm Yarmolinsky (a volume which is still in print under the auspices of another publisher) and the book I review here, &quot;Notebook of Anton Chekhov,&quot; translated by S. S. Koteliansky and Leonard Woolf. <br />Chekhov's stories are, of course, classic examples of the genre. In writing those stories, he was known (not surprisingly) to draw on numerous incidents from his everyday life. As Vladimir Nabokov relates in his &quot;Lectures on Russian Literature,&quot; interpolating and quoting from an article on Chekhov:<br />&quot; 'Do you know how I write my short stories?' [Chekhov] said to Korolenko, the radical journalist and short story writer, when the latter had just made his acquaintance. 'Here's how!' 'He glanced at his table,' Korolenko tells us, 'took up the first object that met his eye--it happened to be an ash tray--placed it before me and said: &quot;If you want it you'll have a story to-morrow. It will be called 'The Ash Tray.' &quot; ' And it seemed to Korolenko then and there that a magical transformation of that ash tray was taking place: 'Certain indefinite situations, adventures which had not yet found concrete form, were already beginning to crystallize about the ash tray.' &quot;<br />Chekhov regularly recorded seemingly mundane daily incidents in notebooks and diaries and later referred to them in writing his stories. It is from this material that Koteliansky and Woolf have drawn in compiling the short (146 pages) collection of materials titled &quot;Notebook of Anton Chekhov.&quot; While hardly an exhaustive collection of these materials, it is a useful little volume that illustrates some of Chekhov's writing habits. <br />The diary excerpts are a mere twelve pages from Chekhov's 1896 diary. The notebook excerpts are 130 pages from the notebooks written between 1894 and 1896. As the translators note in their short introduction to this collection, &quot;[the] volume consists of notes, themes and sketches for works which Anton Chekhov intended to write, and are characteristic of the methods of his artistic production. If he used any material, he used to strike it out in the note-book.&quot; <br />While unfortunately out of print, &quot;Notebook of Anton Chekhov&quot; is a fascinating companion to Chekhov's stories, a little glimmer of insight into how Chekhov created the remarkably drawn pictures of nineteenth century Russian life that still enchant readers today.	2002-04-16

The Italo-Ethiopian War lasted less than eight months, Emperor Haile Selassie's kingdom falling quickly before Italy's modern weaponry. It was a little war that, nonetheless, implicated the great powers of Europe and foreshadowed the much bigger war to follow.<br />Evelyn Waugh was in his early 30s, already the author of four remarkable comic novels, when he accepted an assignment to cover the Italo-Ethiopian War for a London newspaper. The enduring result of that assignment was Waugh's fifth novel, &quot;Scoop,&quot; a scathing satirical assault on the ethos of Fleet Street and its war correspondents, as well as on Waugh's usual suspects, the British upper classes.<br />The time is the 1930s. There is a civil war in the obscure country of Ishmaelia and Lord Copper, the publisher of the Beast newspaper, a newspaper that &quot;stands for strong, mutually antagonistic governments everywhere,&quot; believes coverage of the war is imperative:<br />&quot;I am in consultation with my editors on the subject. We think it a very promising little war. A microcosm you might say of world drama. We propose to give it fullest publicity. We shall have our naval, military and air experts, our squad of photographers, our colour reporters, covering the war from every angle and on every front.&quot;<br />Through the influence of Mrs. Algernon Stitch, Lord Copper soon identifies John Courteney Booth, a best selling popular author, as the right man to cover the war in Ishmaelia. Neither Lord Copper nor his inscrutable editorial staff, however, is especially well read or familiar with the current socially respectable literati. Amidst the confusion, Mr. Salter, the foreign editor, mistakenly identifies William Booth, country bumpkin and staff writer for the Beast, as the &quot;Booth&quot; to whom Lord Copper was referring:<br />&quot;At the back of the paper, ignominiously sandwiched between Pip and Pop, the Bedtime Pets, and the recipe for a dish named 'Waffle Scramble,' lay the bi-weekly column devoted to nature: --<br />Lush Places. Edited by William Boot, Countryman.<br />&quot; 'Do you suppose that's the right one?' &quot;<br />&quot; 'Sure of it. The Prime Minister is nuts on rural England.' &quot;<br />&quot; 'He's supposed to have a particularly high-class style: 'Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole' . . . would that be it?' &quot;<br />&quot; 'Yes,' said the Managing Editor. That must be good style. At least it doesn't sound like anything else to me.' &quot;<br />Thus, William Boot, Countryman, soon finds himself on his way to Ishmaelia to cover the civil war for the Beast. Boot hooks up with an experienced wire reporter named Corker along the way. Corker teachers Boot the ins and outs of covering the war, a war in which reportage comes from little more than the imagination of the journalists sent to cover it and the editorial policies of their papers. The real nature of the war correspondent's profession is suggested when Boot and Corker go to the Ishmaelia Press Bureau to obtain their credentials: &quot;Dr. Benito, the director, was away but his clerk entered their names in his ledger and gave them cards of identity. They were small orange documents, originally printed for the registration of prostitutes. The space for thumb-print was now filled with a passport photograph and at the head the word 'journalist' substituted in neat Ishmaelite characters.&quot;<br />Boot, despite his naivety and ignorance of the war correspondent's trade, inadvertently succeeds in trumping his more experienced journalistic competitors in reporting the war. Along the way, his adventures in Ishmaelia provide the perfect Waugh vehicle for a satiric dissection of the journalistic trade and of what passes as governance in the less developed parts of the world, where tribalism and nepotism more often than not underlie the veneer of ostensibly functioning politicalsystems.<br />Boot, of course, returns to England, where he is now a household name. But one Boot is just as good as another, or so it seems. In the confusion of Boots, William, the real war correspondent, thankfully returns to his country home while his doddering, half-senile Uncle Theodore fulfills his role as the center of attention at the Beast and the prominent author John Courteney Booth (the man who started all this) mistakenly ends up with a knighthood intended for William.<br />&quot;Scoop&quot; is another brilliant Waugh comic send-up based on real-life experience, in this case his experience as a war correspondent in Ethiopia. It also is one of his best works, a little comic novel that will keep you in stitches from beginning to end.	2002-04-16
US	49563640	R1ZUJP1DKNY2NO	0192822268	857337672	Three Tales (The World's Classics)	Books	4	18	21	N	N	Not Flaubert's Best, But Worth Reading Nonetheless	In 1877, twenty years after the publication of \\"Madame Bovary,\\" Gustave Flaubert published \\"Three Tales,\\" a thin volume containing the stories \\"A Simple Heart,\\" \\"The Legend of St Julian Hospitator\\" and \\"Herodias.\\" While Robert Baldick's introduction to the Penguin edition says that \\"Three Tales\\" is \\"still generally regarded as [Flaubert's] most successful and most representative work,\\" it is by no means his best work and does not approach the level of literary genius displayed in \\"Madame Bovary,\\" \\"Sentimental Education,\\" or \\"Bouvard and Pecuchet.\\"<br />The best of the tales is \\"A Simple Heart,\\" the story of Felicite, a simple and pious servant girl who \\"loved her mistress with dog-like devotion and veneration.\\"  Orphaned at a young age, she is first taken in by a farmer who, \\"small as she was, [sent] her to look after the cows in the fields.\\"  It is a miserable life:<br />\\"She went about in rags, shivering with cold, used to lie flat on the ground to drink water out of the ponds, would be beaten for no reason at all, and was finally turned out of the house for stealing thirty sous, a theft of which she was innocent.\\"<br />Felicite fortunately enters the service of another farmer who appreciates her devoted, unquestioning work habits.  She grows into her adult years working for that farmer and then is retained as servant to Madame Aubain.  Felicite's life with Madame Aubain forms the heart of the story, the first sentence of Flaubert's narrative adumbrating the whole: \\"For half a century the women of Pont-l'Eveque envied Madame Aubain her maidservant Felicite.\\"<br />Felicite's life is a series of loves: of Theodore, a man whom she falls in love with at the age of eighteen and who leaves her for an older, wealthier woman; of the two children of Madame Aubain, who depart her world in different ways; of a nephew, who leaves on a sailing ship; of a poor old dying man who lives in a pig sty; and, finally, of a green parrot named Loulou.  Throughout all these loves, \\"the years slipped by, each one like the last, with nothing to vary the rhythm of the great festivals:  Easter, the Assumption, All Saints' Day.\\"   <br />It is interesting to quote what Flaubert had to say about the end of \\"A Simple Heart,\\" because it is not entirely clear whether it reflects his true feelings or an ironic denial of irony: \\"When the parrot dies she has it stuffed, and when she herself comes to die she confuses the parrot with the Holy Ghost. This is not at all ironical as you may suppose, but on the contrary very serious and very sad. I want to move tender hearts to pity and tears, for I am tender-hearted myself.\\" <br />While readers have struggled with whether the three tales are connected in any way, the confusion of Felicite suggests a Flaubertian irony (or perhaps cynicism) that runs through all the stories: that people who live their lives based on religious belief are living lives based on illusion. In the case of Felicite, it is an illusion that is suggested by the confusion of a stuffed green parrot named Loulou with the Holy Ghost. In the remaining two tales, it is suggested in other ways. <br />\\"The Legend of St Julian Hospitator\\" tells the story of Julian, who grows up in a castle and lives a life marked by violence and mysticism. It is the reworking of a well-worn medieval tale depicted in thirty scenes of a stained-glass window Flaubert saw in Rouen Cathedral. It is also a tale that suggests again that the Christian founding myths are perhaps not what they seem. Thus, Julian's dream of life in the Garden of Eden and of Noah's Ark seems like the dream of a world created by a demiurge, a kind of Gnostic vision of brutality rather than harmony and salvation:<br />\\"Sometimes, in a dream, he would see himself like our father Adam in the middle of Paradise, with all the birds and beasts around him; and stretching out his arm, he would put them to death. Or else they would file past him, two by two, according to size, from the elephants and lions down to the stoats and ducks, as they did on the day that they entered Noah's Ark. From the shadow of a cave he would hurl javelins at them which never missed their aim, but others would follow them, there would be no end to the slaughter, and he would wake up with his eyes rolling wildly.\\"<br />There is, finally, \\"Herodias,\\" in which Flaubert relates the story of the beheading of John the Baptist at the request of Salome. Like the other two tales, \\"Herodias\\" is unsettling to the Christian mythos insofar as it emphasizes verisimilitude and the mundane. Instead of painting a picture of a great historical event, \\"Herodias\\" tells a very human tale of politics, jealousy and factionalism in ancient Israel. By doing so, it brings the reader back to the original historical touchstones of writers like Josephus and other contemporaries of Herod, thereby attenuating the centuries of religious mythmaking that followed the real world events. Perhaps this is why no less a critic than Hippolyte Adolphe Taine, commenting on \\"Three Tales,\\" said that, \\"these eighty pages teach me more about the circumstances, the origins and the background of Christianity than all of Renan's work.\\"<br />While not his best work, \\"Three Tales\\" nonetheless provides remarkable insight into Flaubert's narrative style and his view of literature. It is a style and a view that consistently departs from romanticism (even though the casual reader perhaps thinks of \\"Madame Bovary\\" as a romantic story), using techniques and images that draw meticulous scenes of the real and plumb the psychological depths of the mundane. By all means, read \\"Madame Bovary\\" and \\"Sentimental Education,\\" but don't forget \\"Three Tales\\" because it is an equally provocative example of Flaubert's literary endeavor.	2002-04-16

Stumbling upon it as a teenager in the mid-'80s, I found a space in which you could be an intellectual and a punk; where it was okay to love Kafka and comic books, Anne Sexton and the Sex Pistols, Mary McCarthy and Mary Gaitskill. Back then, lit-crit institutions like the Partisan Review and The New York Review of Books-once breeding grounds for original minds-had settled into a stiff, stuffy worldview. Swapping highbrow snobbery for a seductive mix of downtown cool and zealot fervor, The Voice Literary Supplement discovered a new audience-readers like me who loved books but felt alienated by the way the established magazines treated literature as a sanctuary from the funky mess of the modern world.\\"<br />\\"War of the Words\\" is organized into five distinct sections, the title of each providing a good insight into the articles that follow.<br />The first section, \\"Writers Reconsidered: New Takes on the Old Guard,\\" contains seven revisionist readings of well-known authors. These articles include some of the most interesting writing in the collection, with Albert Mobilio providing a sympathetic and interesting take on Gertrude Stein, David Foster Wallace writing a footnote-laden, insightful reading of Dostoevsky, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. illuminating the real significance of Langston Hughesand the need to create an African-American literary canon. There is also a short, acerbic and largely correct assessment of John Cheever (\\"the most overrated American writer there is\\").<br />The second section, \\"Rescue Me: Snatching Writers from the Dustbin of History,\\" is an outstanding series of pieces on writers who have never quite had the audience or prominence that their writing deserved. Here we have characteristic explorations of the writing of Zora Neal Hurston, Philip K. Dick, Thomas Bernhard, Samuel Delany, Djuna Barnes, William Goyen, Albert Murray, and Angela Carter. <br />\\"Signs of the Times: Capturing the Cultural Moment,\\" is perhaps the most difficult and, in some respects, dated group of articles in this collection. The articles provide, however, a very good insight into the way the VLS has engaged the cultural clashes of the past twenty years, often publishing viewpoints that don't easily fit into categories of Right and Left, Highbrow and Lowbrow. The articles here explore such topics as queer theory, postmodernism, anthropology and whiteness, black feminism, and other cultural and intellectual flash points of the past two decades.<br />The fourth section, \\"Pulp Fiction: Obsessing over Pop Culture,\\" is a sampling of articles that demonstrate how the VLS has never fit easily into highbrow literary culture. There's Dorothy Allison writing on Anne Rice, Geoffrey O'Brien on Classic Comics (a topic near and dear to my heart since my early literary education was largely from those wonderful cultural texts), and Greil Marcus with a long, detailed exploration of Situationism. There's also articles on Black Romance Novels, Sammy Davis, Jr., The Andy Warhol Diaries, and Physique Magazines. Get the picture? The VLS doesn't discriminate in its literary/cultural explorations.<br />The last section of the book is devoted to reprinting some of the short articles that have appeared in the VLS over the years on new writers. \\"Brave New Wave: Spotlight on EmergingWriters,\\" includes pieces on Dennis Cooper, Kathy Acker, Mary Gaitskill (one of my favorites), Nicholson Baker (another favorite), Lorrie Moore, Chang-Rae Lee, and Jonathan Lethem (who also has written a piece of his own, \\"Science Fiction's Lost Promise,\\" that is published in the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" section).<br />\\"War of the Words\\" is a very good collection of articles from the past twenty years of the VLS, a collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in seeing new and different ways to envision and understand literature and culture at the close of the twentieth century.	2002-04-16

Le Guin until I recently picked up &quot;Dancing at the Edge of the World,&quot; a chronologically arranged collection of essays, talks and book reviews written by Le Guin during the period 1976 through 1988. It is a collection that is intended, in the author's words, &quot;[to] provide a sort of mental biography, a record of responses to ethical and political climates, of the transforming effect of certain literary ideas, and of the changes of a mind.&quot;<br />Each of the essays listed in the table of contents is denoted with a glyph that categorizes the essay as dealing with feminism, social responsibility, literature, or travel. This categorization gives the reader a good idea of the range of the collection and of Le Guin's interests, which extend far beyond the science fiction genre for which she is most well known.<br />The quality of the essays is uneven. Some of the travel pieces are soporific (&quot;Places Names,&quot; &quot;Along the Platte&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and a Great Way Off&quot;), although they might be more interesting to readers who have been to the places Le Guin describes. Other pieces seem to suffer from the loss caused by transforming what were originally spoken presentations into writing. The feminist writings in some cases are the victim of changing times. What is useful, however, even in these weaker pieces, are Le Guin's introductions, which provide a useful contextual background that helps the reader understand the import of the essay.<br />While some of the essays are unremarkable, there also are several exceptional writings that are worth the price of admission. I refer, in particular, to the 1988 essay, &quot;The Fisherman's Daughter,&quot; which provides a provocative and interesting discussion of women and writing, a text that follows in the line from Virginia Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; through Tillie Olsen's &quot;Silences,&quot; drawing heavily on both authors for another view of this much discussed literary/feminist theme. I also refer to the essays from 1986, a very good year for Le Guin insofar as the six essays included here from that year all provide interesting and worthwhile glimpses at why her writing is so well regarded. In particular, I enjoyed &quot;Bryn Mawr Commencement Address&quot; and &quot;Text, Silence, Performance,&quot; two essays that illuminate the ways in which spoken and written language, and the privileging of certain communicative forms over others, affects the world.<br />Despite the shortcomings of some of its essays, &quot;Dancing at the Edge of the World&quot; provides a fascinating picture of Le Guin's worldview, successfully painting the &quot;mental biography&quot; of one of America's more interesting and accomplished writers during one decade of her life.	2002-04-16

Then imagine that a twelve-year-old girl who lives in the town disappears in the middle of the day, less than a mile from her home, while returning from school. Disappears without a trace, except only for the bicycle found by the side of the road. Then imagine a more chilling twist. The girl's clothes and belongings suddenly appear at the town police station, the clothes washed and neatly folded in a box. A second and a third girl vanish in the same way, their clothes, too, cleaned, folded and mysteriously returned. And all of this occurs in a town with a history, a history that includes the unsolved murder of a seemingly promiscuous, middle-aged woman several years earlier, a woman who was known by many men in the town. <br />This is the narrative premise of \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\", a literate and disturbing portrait of how a community unravels when the bonds of trust are broken, when someone in the midst of the community becomes a killer. And while the reader knows from the first lines of the book what has happened (\\"This is how they looked: three dead girls propped up in three straight chairs\\"), Stephen Dobyns succeeds in writing a story that is as complex as real life, a discomforting exploration of the lives and histories and motivations of everyone in the town. Narrated by an enigmatic and unidentified biology teacher, a middle-aged man who has taught all of the missing girls and has a close personal relationship with a young girl who is one of their classmates, \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" is peopled by a wide range of characters whose lives intersect in many ways, each drawing suspicion, if not for their relationship with the victims, then simply because they deviate from the norm. <br />\\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" is the perfect book for someone looking for a well written, page-turning diversion or someone who wants to curl up in their bed alone on a dark nightand give themselves over to a chillingly disturbing tale of every town's worst nightmare.	2002-04-13

Together, in the 1920s, Bohr and Heisenberg had been instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics, complementarity and the uncertainty principle, concepts which provided the theoretical underpinning for modern nuclear physics and, ultimately, the atomic bomb. Hence, the reason for Heisenberg's visit to Bohr, and what Heisenberg and Bohr discussed during that visit, has been the subject of much historical speculation. It is this event which forms the basis for Michael Frayn's thought-provoking play of ideas, \\"Copenhagen\\".<br />Heisenberg's role in Germany's effort to develop atomic weapons has been the topic of much speculation, historians tending to place him on one side or the other of the moral dividing line. There are those who paint him as an evil tool of the Nazis, someone who willingly devoted himself to Germany's scientific efforts to develop an atomic weapon. From their perspective, there has been a tendency to read Heisenberg's 1941 visit to Bohr as an effort to recruit Bohr to the German scientific fold. There are others who see the visit as more enigmatic, who do not ascribe such clear intentions to Heisenberg, and who see in the historical record evidence that Heisenberg was a passive opponent of the Nazis' objectives, a scientist who quietly undermined the German scientific effort while ostenbibly remaining a \\"good\\" German. <br />Frayn brilliantly depicts the uncertainty of Heisenberg's motivations, as well as the uncertainty of what occurred at the meeting between the two scientists, using the theory of these physicists to illumine not the physical world, but the psychological world of human motives. \\"Uncertainty\\" thus describes not merely the behavior of the atom, but also the behavior of individuals living in ethically difficult historical circumstances. As Frayn notes in his Postscript to the text of this play, \\"thoughts and intentions, even one's own-perhaps one's own most of all-remain shifting and elusive. There is not one single thought or intention of any sort that can ever be precisely established.\\"<br />\\"Copenhagen\\" is lucidly and sparely written, a play of dialogue among only three characters-Heisenberg, Bohr and Bohr's wife, Margrethe. There are, of course, numerous references to the esoteric world of theoretical physics, particularly as it developed in the 1920s, and the Postscript to the text is therefore especially helpful in understanding both the scientific and historical frames of reference for the play. <br />Read this little play-better yet, see it if you can-because \\"Copenhagen\\" is a dramatic work that truly deserves to be recognized as one of outstanding plays of recent years.	2002-04-13
US	49563640	RF704EUX9RT4W	081120197X	449332450	Arthur Rimbaud: A Biography	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Classic Literary Biography	Enid Starkie's biography of Rimbaud, published nearly forty years ago, still stands as both the definitive narrative of Rimbaud's life and a model of literary biography. <br />Rimbaud was a rebellious, enigmatic, brilliant, and inscrutable poet who, in just four short years between the ages of sixteen and twenty, wrote the poetry which has made him a figure of mythic proportions, not only in French literature, but in the literature and history of Modernism. Starkie, in brilliantly lucid prose and with loving attention to every detail, tells Rimbaud's life story and connects that story to the writing of the poems and the evolution of Rimbaud's views on poetry and the task of the poet. <br />Influenced by his studies of Kabbalah, alchemy and illuminism, and writing in the long shadow of Baudelaire's \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\", Rimbaud precociously enunciated his attack on the then dominant Parnassian school of French poetry at the tender age of sixteen. Starkie examines Rimbaud's original aesthetic doctrine in great detail; in her words, the poet must discover a \\"new language . . . capable of expressing the ineffable, a new language not bound by logic, nor by grammar or syntax.\\" In Rimbaud's words, the \\"Poet\\" must make himself a \\"seer\\" by a \\"long, immense and systematic derangement of all the senses.\\" <br />From this initial position, Starkie brilliantly details Rimbaud's turbulent relationship with Paul Verlaine and his descent into what one reviewer has aptly described as a \\"perpetual roister of absinthe, hashish and sodomy.\\" Starkie painstakingly relates Rimbaud's poetry to his experiences with Verlaine in London and Paris. In particular, Starkie convincingly demonstrates, through careful exegesis of the poems and their correspondences with Rimbaud's letters and other biographical materials, that the \\"Illuminations\\" (perhaps Rimbaud's most brilliant poems) were written over several years preceding and following \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\". Starkie then goes on to demonstrate that the latter prose poems were hardly intended to be Rimbaud's \\"farewell to literature in general, but only to visionary literature.\\" In other words, \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\" represents the rejection by Rimbaud of his original mind-bending iconoclasm--the liquidation \\"of all his previous dreams and aspirations\\"--in favor of a rational and materialist aesthetics. Of course, after completing \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\", Rimbaud's life moved in completely different directions and there is, unfortunately, no existing evidence that he continued his poetic endeavor after the age of twenty. <br />Starkie's biography captures the details of the remainder of Rimbaud's life--he died at the age of thirty-seven--with fascinating and attentive detail. And the remainder of his life, as related by Starkie, is a biography in itself--vagabond in Europe, sailor to the East Indies, gun runner and (slave?) trader in Abyssinia, and mysterious cult hero of the emerging French symbolist movement. Indeed, in 1888, more than fourteen years after Rimbaud's known literary career had ended, he received a letter from a prominent Parisian editor: \\"You have become, among a little coterie, a sort of legendary figure . . . This little group, who claim you as their Master, do not know what has become of you, but hope you will one day reappear, and rescue them from obscurity.\\" Starkie scrutinizes all of these events with scrupulous attention to detail and accuracy. <br />This is truly a classic of literary biography! (One additional comment: Rimbaud's poetry and letters are quoted extensively in the original French. If you are not fluent in French, you should have Wallace Fowlie's English translation of Rimbaud's Complete Works and Selected Letters by your side as a reference.)	2002-04-13

Thus begins Bernhard Schlink's short, sparely written novel, \\"The Reader\\". From there, the plot of this best-selling novel is well known. Berg spends many days with Hanna, reading to her and making love, the mysterious woman becoming the obsession and fulfillment of erotic desire. Then, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Berg's life as quickly and mysteriously as she had entered it. Several years later, in the mid-1960s, Berg once again encounters Hanna, this time standing trial for war crimes as a former guard at Auschwitz. His obsession rekindled, Berg's narrative follows Hanna's trial, disclosing her wartime crimes and her \\"secret\\", and relating the austere relationship which continued between them during Hanna's years of imprisonment.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is a little novel that has big aspirations, its austere prose and simple plot suggesting to the reader that there is something more, something unsaid, about the engimatic Hanna. Unfortunately, Hanna's ultimate \\"secret\\"-her illiteracy-does not bear the weight of Schlink's story, does not adequately explain Hanna's actions. It may become a wonderful television movie, but \\"The Reader\\" is not the classic work that, for example, George Steiner's profuse praise suggests. While the first part of the novel, a little erotic fairy tale of the affair between Berg and Hanna, is a concentrated work of spare, lucid prose which \\"hooks\\" the reader, the remainder of the book is not nearly so good and never carries the weight of the big questions Schlink wants to raise-questions of guilt and love and the relationship between generations in post-War Germany.<br />It is certainly worth spending a few short hours with \\"The Reader\\", an interesting, if not profound, novel with some very good writing. Just don't expect a modern classic.	2002-04-13

Set during a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf brilliantly used techniques which became hallmarks of the modern novel--interior monologue, first person narrative and a stunning, albeit unrelentingly difficult, stream-of-consciousness rendering--to produce one of the masterpieces of twentieth century English literature. Nearly seventy-five years later, Michael Cunningham has used many of these same techniques to write \\"The Hours\\", a fitting homage to Woolf and a novel which deservedly won both the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br />\\"The Hours\\" tells the story of a bright June day in the lives of three different women living in three different times and places. The first story is that of Virginia Woolf during a day in 1923, when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". The second is the story of Laura Brown, a thirtyish, bookish married woman living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Laura has a four-year-old son and is pregnant with another child as she plans a birthday dinner for her husband on a day in 1949. The third story is that of Clarissa Vaughn, a fifty-two year old, slightly bohemian, literary agent who is planning a party for Richard, her long-time friend and one-time lover, a prominent writer dying of AIDS.<br />\\"The Hours\\" is, among other things, a nuanced and sensitive picture of middle age in the lives of its characters. Like the novel to which it pays tribute, \\"The Hours\\" relies heavily on interior monologue-on thoughts, memories and perceptions-to drive the narrative and to establish a powerful bond between the reader and each of the female protagonists. The reader feels the psychic pain of the aging Virginia Woolf as she contemplates suicide in the Prologue. The reader has an almost tactile sense of Laura Brown's claustrophobia, of her feeling that life is closing in around her, as she flees to a hotel for two hours in the middle of the day simply to spend time reading (\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", of course). And the reader can identify with the yearning, the melancholy, that is suggested when Clarissa Vaughn thinks back to the time when she was young, when her life's choices had not yet been made. <br />\\"The Hours\\" is written, in short, like all great fiction--with deep feeling and love for its characters-and it stands as one of the outstanding American novels of the past decade. While resonating with the themes, techniques and characters of Woolf's difficult modern masterpiece, \\"The Hours\\" is masterful and original in its own right, an accessible and engaging work that is worth all the time you spend with it.	2002-04-13

Winslow went on to write a detailed compendium of alleged cases of premature burial, mixing fact with folklore and creating a kind of Ur-text for what subsequently became both a widespread popular fear in Western Europe and an at-times respected (if sometimes eccentric) intellectual and social movement for measures to eliminate the risk of premature burial. <br />In \\"Buried Alive\\", Dr. Jan Bondeson, professor at the University of Wales College of Medicine, traces the history of the fear of premature burial in Western Europe and the United States, a fear that attained its clearest popular expression in the macabre literature of writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, but which had a much more significant, albeit less well known, intellectual history. Beginning with Winslow's treatise, which was written in Latin and known by few outside the Parisian medical profession, Bondeson carefully explores how Winslow's work was translated into French, and popularized, in the mid-eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques Bruhier, another French physician. While Winslow's Latin treatise would have been confined to the dusty archives of history, Bruhier was a great popularizer and his translation and expansion of Winslow's book was widely read and translated in France and other countries of Western Europe. From this popularization, there developed a widespread popular fear of premature burial, as well as a legitimate medical debate about how to determine whether a person was dead or alive.<br />The popular fear and the professional debate went through many iterations. In Germany, Christopher Wilhelm Hufeland, a practicing physician, published an article in 1790 which outlined a plan to erect a house for the dead in his hometown of Weimar. The idea was based upon the general belief that the only reliable means of determining death was the onset of putrefaction. Popularizing an idea originally suggested in Bruhier's work, Hufeland's proposal was avidly endorsed within Germany and led to the construction of numerous waiting mortuaries or \\"Leichenhauser\\", where the dead were attached to alarm devices to detect movement and identify those who were not, in fact, dead and also to observe the onset of putrefaction. Indeed, Leichenhauser continued to exist into the twentieth century in Germany.<br />In England and the United States, both the popular and medical concern about premature burial arrived much later. Indeed, it was only in the nineteenth century that the English and Americans began to give any credence to the fear and to the medical issue and, even then, it largely became the short-lived domain of spiritualists and charlatans. It did result, however, in the development of a number of ingenious security vaults and other coffins and burial devices intended to allow the person buried alive to survive and signal those in the world of the living of their grim fate. Perhaps the most well known of these devices was the so-called \\"Bateson's Belfry\\", a coffin which allowed its still living inhabitant to ring a bell that stood above the grave, presumably permitting a post-interment rescue.<br />\\"Buried Alive\\" is a fascinating and methodical exploration of the fear and the intellectual and social history surrounding the idea of premature burial in Western Europe and the United States from the eighteenth century to the present. However, unlike Bondeson's earlier work, \\"A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities\\", which never ceased to fascinate and entertain, \\"Buried Alive\\" is much more like an academic treatise, a book which certainly hassuitable rewards for the reader, but which is written in prose that is dry as bone.	2002-04-13

His parents, both raised in Jewish homes (one devoutly orthodox and the other largely secular) by first-generation immigrants from Russia and Poland, reach adulthood during the turbulent years of World War II. Both his father and his mother grapple with their Jewish tradition and their personal religious beliefs and, ultimately, become converts to Roman Catholicism. Like many converts, the decision by Stephen's parents to adopt a new religion is not made lightly and results in a deeply didactic religious practice. Stephen grows up in a home where devout Catholic religious practice is the norm and where little is ever mentioned about the Jewish tradition his parents have rejected. As an adult, Stephen embarks on his own religious search, inheriting the same \\"turbulent soul\\" that had so deeply marked his parents' lives. Dubner aptly quotes John Henry Newman, the famous Anglican cardinal who converted to Roman Catholicism, who says, \\"who can know himself and the multitude of subtle influences which act upon him.\\" He then explores, in wonderfully clear and readable prose, the many subtle influences which marked his parents' soul-searching religious struggles, as well as his own. Dubner's exploration leads him to learn more about his parents and their lives, the history of his family and its Eastern European Jewish roots, and, ultimately, to an understanding and reconciliation with his mother, who maintains her firm Catholic convictions to the end, even as Dubner returns to the Jewish faith of his grandparents. Ultimately, Dubner's memoir has an important message--that every individual who has a \\"turbulent soul\\" and seeks religious faith must be accorded the respect and autonomy of his or her beliefs. It is a message for parents, for children, and for members of all faiths: do not become so certain of yourown religious \\"truth\\" that you alienate and reject the sincere, but different, beliefs of others. As Dubner says at the end of his narration of the struggle of three turbulen souls, \\"[i]f I am sure of one thing about God, it is that our most brilliant ideas about Him are sheer guesswork.\\"	2002-04-13

It is a train that makes no stops. From this simple premise, Pelevin elaborates a sometimes absurd, sometimes mystical, parable of life in Russian society. Or is it life in general? Either way, the narrative works on many levels and provides an entertaining and, for those who like, metaphysically speculative foray into where we're all headed.<br />\\"The Yellow Arrow\\" is essentially the story of one passenger-Andrei's-life on the train. Told in the third person, the reader lives inside the mind of Andre, thinking what he thinks, seeing what he sees, experiencing what he experiences. Andrei becomes the protagonist for open-ended speculation about the meaning of life on the train. Thus, early in the narrative, Andrei sits in the restaurant car of the train and speculates (in a passage that is typical Pelevin and that provides a resonant connection to the meaning of \\"The Yellow Express\\"): <br />\\"Watching the hot sunlight falling on the table-cloth covered with sticky blotches and crumbs, Andrei was suddenly struck by the thought of what a genuine tragedy it was for millions of light rays to set out on their journey from the surface of the sun, go hurtling through the infinite void of space and pierce the mile-thick sky of Earth, only to be extinguished in the revolting remains of yesterday's soup. Maybe these yellow arrows slanting in through the window were conscious, hoped for something better-and realized that their hopes were groundless, giving them all the necessary ingredients for suffering.\\"<br />The train becomes a deep-seated metaphor for lives in society, for those who live those lives with unquestioning acceptance and for those who don't-those who wonder about the train and about whether there is anything else, anything outside the train. Thus, Andrei's friend, Khan, draws a distinction between those like him and Andrei, who reflect and question where they are and what they're doing, and those who do not: \\"A normal passenger never thinks of himself as a passenger. So if you know you're a passenger, you no longer are one. They could never imagine it's impossible to get off this train. Nothing else exists for them, apart from the train.\\" <br />But whether or not anything exists outside the train, whether you can get off the train, is less important than what is in your head. As Khan suggests to Andrei, \\"It doesn't matter in the least whether anything else exists apart from our train. What matters is that we can live as though there is something else. As though it really is possible to get off. That's the only difference. But if you try to explain that difference to any of the passengers, they won't understand.\\"<br />I hope this gives a flavor for Pelevin's writing and for the tone of \\"The Yellow Express.\\" While a short work, Pelevin succeeds in creating a compelling and satirically amusing metaphorical world, a world that provides sublime insight into what it means to think and to question in a society that encourages unquestioning acceptance. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.	2002-04-13

The result, based upon two papers she delivered to literary societies at Newnham and Girton in October of that year, was \\"A Room of One's Own\\", an extended essay on women as both writers of fiction and as characters in fiction. And, while Woolf suggests that, \\"when a subject is highly controversial-and any question about sex is that-one cannot hope to tell the truth,\\" her essay is, in fact, an extraordinarily even-handed, thoughtful and perceptive reflection on the topic.<br />Woolf begins with a simple and enigmatic opinion: \\"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unresolved.\\" From this spare beginning, Woolf deftly explores the difference between how women had been portrayed in fiction, and how they actually lived in the world, during the preceding centuries. \\"A very queer, composite being emerges. Imaginatively, she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was a slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger.\\"<br />The source of dissonance between how women were portrayed in fiction, and how they actually lived, was the fact that most fiction prior to the nineteenth century was written by men. As Woolf astutely points out, \\"[i]t was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen's day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex.\\" Woolf's observation is no feminist polemic; it is, rather, an incisive comment on how fiction was impoverished when it was written only by men.<br />Even when fiction was written by women, it was powerfully influenced by patriarchal notions of virtue and the proper role of women. Thus, Woolf suggests there could be no female Shakespeare in sixteenth century England because no women would be tolerated who lived in the real world like the Bard. \\"No girl could have walked to London and stood at a stage door and forced her way into the presence of actor-managers without doing herself violence and suffering an anguish which may have been irrational-for chastity may be a fetish invented by societies for unknown reasons-but were none the less inevitable.\\" Indeed, this \\"relic of the sense of chastity\\" dictated that more daring female authors-George Eliot, George Sand, Currer Bell-maintain anonymity as late as the nineteenth century.<br />When female writers did find a \\"room of their own,\\" they were still limited by social and cultural imperatives. Thus, the first of the great women novelists-Jane Austen, the Brontes, George Eliot-wrote largely from the drawing room, not from the experiences of the larger world-the very conditions of their writing life being as cramped as the their restricted lives. As Woolf notes, in commenting on Charlotte Bronte, \\"[s]he knew, no one better, how enormously her genius would have profited if it had not spent itself in solitary visions over distant fields; if experience and intercourse and travel had been granted her. But they were not granted, they were withheld.\\"<br />Ultimately, Woolf suggests that the \\"true\\" nature of women will only be approached in fiction when women are sufficiently independent-not only in a financial sense, but in the sense of being freed from societal and cultural restraints-to explore the quotidian, the everyday lives of people in the world. This is the aspect of the fictional world that, in Woolf's view, was absent from the male-dominated novel prior to the nineteenth century.<br />Woolf further suggests that the \\"true\\" nature of fiction is expressed only through those writers who can transcend their narrow sexual roles-become \\"man-womanly\\" or \\"woman-manly\\"-so as to convey the fullness of the real world. As Woolf notes, \\"Coleridge perhaps meant this when he said that a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all of its faculties.\\" Based on this criterion, Woolf promulgates her own canon of English male writers, a canon which includes Shakespeare, Keats, Sterne, Cowper, Lamb, Coleridge, and Proust (who \\"was perhaps wholly androgynous, if not perhaps a little too much of a woman\\").<br />\\"A Room of One's Own\\" is, in sum, a fascinating, thoughtful and perceptive essay on women and fiction written by one of the Twentieth century's most formidable writers and thinkers, a woman who truly succeeded in creating a room of her own in the canon of modern English literature.onvey the fullness of the real world.

US	49563640	RLM946FWZQIVN	0811214850	850711751	Vertigo	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A Tour de Force of History, Memory, Dream and Imagination	\\"Vertigo,\\" the third of W. G. Sebald's works to appear in English translation, is a disorienting narrative that conflates history, memory, dream, and imagination. The result is another literary tour de force from the author of \\"The Emigrants\\" and \\"The Rings of Saturn,\\" a remarkable work that is difficult to classify, but reinforces Sebald's deserved reputation as one of Europe's most original and preeminent contemporary writers. <br />\\"Vertigo\\" begins with an historical figure, in this case Marie Henri Beyle, better known to literary history as Stendhal. In the opening section (\\"Beyle, or Love is a Madness Most Discreet\\"), our third person narrator relates certain of the amorous adventures of Beyle during his travels in Italy, beginning with his first arrival in that country at the age of seventeen as a soldier in Napoleon's army. The year is 1800 and the historical record is drawn from Beyle's own notes of his experience, written more than three decades later at the age of 53. As if foreshadowing the vertiginous unreliability of the narrative to follow, the narrator (Sebald?) relates as follows: \\"The notes in which the 53-year-old Beyle, writing during a sojourn at Civitavecchia, attempted to relive the tribulations of those days afford eloquent proof of the various difficulties entailed in the act of recollection.\\"<br />The third person narrative shifts, in the second section, to a first person relation of travels in Austria and Italy by our narrator beginning in the year 1980. It is an unreliable narrative, confounding dream and reality, past and present, in a text that seems to have a mysterious, underlying hermeticism. Thus, while aimlessly wandering the dark streets of Vienna, the narrator often thought he saw someone he knew walking ahead of me. \\"On one occasion, in Gonzagagasse, I even thought I recognized the poet Dante, banished from his hometown on pain of being burned at the stake.\\" Similarly, in the dark, misty, maze-like streets of Venice, \\"there sat,and in fact very nearly lay, a man in a worn green loden coat whom I immediately recognized as King Ludwig II of Bavaria.\\" <br />In a remarkable, resonant passage that writes another layer on the palimpsest of literary renderings of Venice, Sebald writes: \\"As you enter into the heart of that city, you cannot tell what you will see next or indeed who will see you the very next moment. Scarcely has someone made an appearance than he has quit the stage by another exit. These brief exhibitions are of an almost theatrical obscenity and at the same time have an air of conspiracy about them, into which one is drawn against one's will. If you walk behind someone in a deserted alleyway, you have only to quicken your step slightly to instill a little fear into the person you are following. And equally, you can feel like a quarry yourself. Confusion and ice-cold terror alternate.\\"<br />In Venice, too, the narrator muses on the dark history of the Doge's Palace, reflecting, in particular on the early nineteenth century writings of the German Franz Grillparzer and on one of the victims of the harsh justice carried out in that palace, Giacomo Casanova. Grillparzer, a lawyer, ponders that \\"the resolutions passed here by the Council of State must be mysterious, immutable and harsh.\\" It is a thought that brings to mind Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", among other things, and it is not surprising that, in the next breath, the reader learns that Casanova's memoir of his imprisonment in the Doge's Palace was first published in, of all places, Prague. <br />From here, the narrative shifts once again to the third person, this time in a section entitled \\"Dr. K Takes the Waters at Riva.\\" It is, again, a purportedly historical narrative of Franz Kafka's trip in 1913 from Prague to Vienna and then on to Italy, where he visits Venice, Verona and Riva, a city on the shores of Lake Garda. Kafka's journeys mirror those of the narrator in the second section of the book and the dreamlike repetitions, doublings, doppelgangers which re-occur throughout \\"Vertigo\\" provide a deeply entwined narrative for the careful reader. Thus, in a passage that, in some sense, is a trope for the entire text, Kafka stands on the porch of the Pellegrini Chapel in Verona, a place where the narrator himself related he had stood in 1980 in the previous section of the book: \\"When Doctor K. stood in the porch once again, on the threshold between the dark interior and the brightness outside, he felt for a moment as if the selfsame church were replicated before him, its entrance fitting directly with that of the church he had just left, a mirroring effect he was familiar with from his dreams, in which everything was forever splitting and multiplying, over and again, in the most terrifying manner.\\"<br />From Kafka's 1913 experiences, the final section of Vertigo relates the narrator's return in November, 1987, to his childhood home in the Tyrol. It is the most introspective and personal section of \\"Vertigo,\\" but still remains tied to the text that has gone before, resonating with themes, enigmas and uncertainties that make \\"Vertigo\\" a puzzle-palace of literary and historical renderings.<br />I could say much more about \\"Vertigo,\\" tie many more passages and themes together, make a plethora of textual allusions and connections. This would do nothing more, however, than demonstrate the richness of Sebald's imagination, the density of his writing, the dream-like dislocations and uncertainties of his original and unclassifiable literary enterprise. If you read no other book this year, read \\"Vertigo\\" or \\"The Emigrants\\" or \\"The Rings of Saturn\\"; just be sure to read at least one of W. G. Sebald's books because you will not be disappointed.	2002-04-13

The simplest way to express my reaction to this book is to say that, after finishing it, I promptly went out and bought several more of Banville's novels, realizing that he is one of a small handful of truly outstanding contemporary English writers.<br />\\"The Untouchable\\" is the first person narrative of Victor Maskell, Royalist and Marxist, art curator for the English monarchy and spy for the Soviet Union. Maskell's narrative begins in the 1980s, when he is in his seventies, sick with cancer. It is then that his past is suddenly and unexpectedly made public, the prominent, seemingly conservative intellectual revealed to be a man leading a double life, a traitor to his country. The reality, of course, is much more complex, for Maskell's motives, beliefs and actions, like those of all humans, are uncertain, clouded by conflicting memories, versions and perspectives. Married and the father of two children, Maskell is a homosexual. Ostensibly a Marxist and supporter of the great Soviet experiment, he is deeply attached to England and, in very personal ways, to the Royal family. Presumably acting for many years as a spy for the Soviets, the practical value of his activities is largely confined to being a symbolic trophy for his spymasters in the Kremlin, someone who rubs elbows with the highest levels of the British government while providing little in the way of truly useful information.<br />Drawing on the historical facts surrounding the Cambridge spies, \\"The Untouchable\\" is a brilliantly imagined, vividly realistic fictional memoir of the complex and often perplexing life of such a spy. Banville's prose is flawless, his narrative voice is always at perfect pitch, and his characters and story are a masterpiece of verisimilitude.	2002-04-13

Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a once-respected and successful Paris barrister, sits alone in an Amsterdam bar delivering his stark monologue to an unknown listener. It is a confessional narrative, a tale in which Clamence slowly unravels the spare facts of his life, his deceptions, his inauthenticity, his bad faith. <br />As he sits in the dimly lit bar, Clamence makes the locus of his telling a metaphor for the narrative to follow: \\"We are at the heart of things here. Have you noticed that Amsterdam's concentric canals resemble the circles of hell? The middle-class hell, of course, peopled with bad dreams. When one comes from the outside, as one gradually goes throught those circles, life-and hence its crimes-becomes denser, darker. Here we are in the last circle.\\" It is a metaphor that resonates with existential imagery, reminiscent of Sartre's claim, in \\"No Exit\\", that \\"hell is other people.\\" From this grim place, Camus writes a classic of Existentialist literature, building on this metaphor, writing an extended trope of unremitting self-examination, self-doubt and anguish.<br />Clamence was, by all outward appearances, both a virtuous and a modest man. His courtesy was famous and beyond question. He was generous in public and private, literally exulting at the approach of a beggar. He helped the blind man cross the street and the indigent defendant secure a reduced sentence. He ended his afternoons at the café with \\"a brilliant improvisation in the company of several friends on the hard-heartedness of our governing class and the hypocrisy of our leaders.\\" <br />But appearances give lie to the truth, for the truth in \\"The Fall\\" is that life has no meaning, that it is full of ennui, and that people act unthinkingly, inauthentically, habitually. Thus, Clamence reflects on a man he knew, a man \\"who gave twenty years of his life to a scatter-brained woman, sacrificing everything to her,\\" only to realize in the end that he never loved her. How does Clamence explain this? \\"He had been bored, that's all, bored like most people.\\" And from this boredom, the man married and created \\"a life full of complications and drama.\\" For, as Clamence suggests, \\"something must happen-and that explains most human commitments.\\"<br />Clamence describes himself, too, as \\"a double face, a charming Janus,\\" for his motives and feelings, his very psyche, belie his outward virtue. While outwardly supporting the poor and downtrodden, he is \\"well aware that one can't get along without dominating or being served, [for] every man needs slaves as he needs fresh air.\\" While known as a defender of justice, a great Parisian lawyer, his \\"true desire\\" is not \\"to be the most intelligent or the most generous creature on earth, but only to beat anyone [he] wanted to, to be the stronger.\\" While professing deep love and affection for the many women in his life, he is a misogynist who \\"never loved any of them.\\" As Clamence cynically suggests, \\"true love is exceptional, [occurring] two or three times a century more or less. The rest of the time there is vanity or boredom.\\" <br />\\"The Fall\\" is a little novel that makes the reader ponder big questions, questions of meaning and existence and death, of how we live our lives and of what motivates our actions. It is, in other words, a novel that articulates the open-ended questioning characteristic of the French Existentialism of the 1940s and 1950s. But it is more than that, for it is also perhaps the finest work of one of France's greatest Twentieth Century authors, a work that deserves to be read, re-read and pondered.	2002-04-13

What I mean to say is that once I start reading one of his books, I can't stop. Nothing gets done around the house, I have less time with my wife and children, the dog doesn't get walked, and you can forget about the stack of papers I brought home from the office to review over the weekend. <br />This is exactly what happened when, on a Friday night, I decided I needed something easy to read, a page-turner, a plain old story-in short, something by Stephen King, the modern American master of the ripping yarn, replete with its baggage of cultural references no one will be able to decode a hundred years from now and deficient only if you cannot abide horror or terror or the macabre. Once I started \\"Misery,\\" I didn't put it down until I was finished, and I loved every reading minute of it.<br />\\"Misery\\" is not one of King's typical horror stories, that is, it does not require \\"the willing suspension of disbelief\\" that is needed when you read about telekinetic powers (\\"Carrie\\" or \\"Firestarter\\"), monsters from sewers (\\"It\\"), vampires (\\"Salem's Lot\\"), or any one of King's many other supernatural or unnatural characters (a very long list of King's books). \\"Misery\\" is, instead, one of King's stories that, while extreme and terrifying, is also realistically possible. It is one of his better books, written during a time when he wrote a string of similar, realistic horror stories that I consider among his best, including \\"Dolores Claiborne,\\" \\"Gerald's Game\\" and \\"Rose Madder.\\"<br />The plot is straightforward. Paul Sheldon is a popular author known for his series of novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Sheldon finally kills off Misery, thereby ridding him, once and for all, of the pulpy best selling series and allowing him to move on, living off the royalties, to write more highbrow literary novels. Sheldon has, in fact, just finished writing such a novel and is driving home, manuscript in tow (theonly copy, in fact), when he drives off a road in the wilds of Colorado during a blinding snowstorm. He is severely injured and, under less fortunate circumstances, his car probably would have been buried in snow and he would have died of exposure. Instead, he has the blessed fortune to be found by Annie Wilkes, one of his most devoted fans, an avid admirer of the Misery Chastain novels, and a reclusive-and deadly-psychopath. <br />Annie, a nurse by training, takes the author to her home, where she holds him captive for several months while he resurrects Misery Chastain, writing a new novel in the series for Annie Wilkes's private enjoyment. The Babylonian Captivity pales in comparison to the mental and physical tortures that author Paul Sheldon endures, and King keeps the reader turning the pages, wondering what cruel or grisly event will follow one of Annie's many mood changes. It is vintage Stephen King, one of his better efforts, a book that I highly recommend if you're a King fan and, if your not, a good place to get some insight into King's imagination and skill as a story teller. It is also an interesting book for many other reasons, not the least of which are the way in which the plot of his novel is a kind of horror-writer's take on the relationship between author and editor, as well as between author and reader (Annie Wilkes, his mentally deranged, sadistic fan becoming not only his reader, but also his editor-in-captivity), the way in which an author who may have more serious literary aspirations can become captive to a reading public that becomes enthralled with his commercially-motivated work, and the way in which \\"Misery,\\" as well as several other works written around this same period, embody things going on in King's own life (see, in this regard, his autobiographical piece in his book, \\"On Writing\\").<br />While \\"Misery\\" may not be a great work of literature by highbrow standards, it is a great piece of storytelling by an author who is, perhaps, America's foremost popular, contemporary storyteller. For that reason, if no other, it's worth putting everything aside for awhile and just reading.	2002-04-13

Immediately the subject of controversy upon its publication in 1796, Lewis was prosecuted and subsequent editions of the book were heavily censored. Coleridge described it as blasphemous, \\"a romance, which if a parent saw it in the hands of a son or daughter, he might reasonably turn pale.\\" Yet, \\"The Monk\\" was so popular that its author became a minor celebrity-coming to be known as \\"Monk\\" Lewis--and Sir Walter Scott prounounced that \\"it seemed to create an epoch in our literature.\\" And whether \\"The Monk\\" truly created an epoch in English literature, or merely marked the early apogee of a genre, it stands as a stunning example of the Gothic novel.<br />\\"The Monk\\" tells the story of Ambrosio, the ostensibly pious and deeply revered Abbot of the Capuchin monastery in Madrid, and his dark fall from grace. It is a novel which unravels, at times, like the \\"Arabian Nights\\", stories within stories, a series of digressions, the plot driven by love and lust, temptations and spectres, and, ultimately, rape, murder and incest. It is sharply anti-Catholic, if not anti-clerical, in tone, Ambrosio and most of its other religious characters being profane, murderous, self-centered hypocrites cloaked in displays of public piety. And while it sometimes seems critical of superstition, \\"The Monk\\" is replete with Mephistophelian bargains, supernatural events, appartions, and spectres, as well as entombment and dark forebodings of mystery and evil. It is, in short, a stunningly entertaining, albeit typically heavy-handed, Gothic novel, perhaps the ultimate classic of the genre.	2002-04-13

Seeking a sanctuary to finish his work, he rents a small cottage at an estate in southern Ireland known as Fern House, \\"a big gloomy pile with ivy and peeling walls and a smashed fanlight over the door, the kind of place where you picture a mad stepdaughter locked up in the attic.\\" It is a setting, and a story, heavy with gothic overtones. <br />In his words, \\"the book was as good as done, I had only to gather up a few loose ends and write the conclusion-but in those first few weeks at Ferns something started to go wrong . . . I was concentrating, with morbid fascination, on the chapter I had devoted to [Newton's] breakdown and those two letters [Newton had written] to Locke.\\" <br />He becomes obsessed, however, not only with Newton's two letters to John Locke, but also with the inhabitants of Fern House: Edward, the often drunk master of the house; Charlotte, his wife, a tall, middle-aged woman with an abstracted air and a penchant for gardening; Ottilie, the big, blonde, twenty-four year old niece of Charlotte; and Michael, the adopted son of Edward and Charlotte. <br />The narrator soon becomes entangled with Ottilie in a mysterious way when she appears at his door. \\"It's strange to be offered, without conditions, a body you don't really want.\\" But what, exactly, is the nature of his relationship with Ottilie? When he embraces her, he feels \\"the soft shock of being suddenly, utterly inhabited.\\" In the pervasive aura of the gothic, the reader wonders exactly what is happening, for, as the narrator enigmatically relates in the middle of the novel while making love to Ottilie, \\"how should I tell her that she was no longer the woman I was holding in my arms?\\" It is a strange statement, presumably intended to refer to the fact that the narrator's true obsession is with the older, aloof Charlotte, even as he cavorts with Ottilie. The mystery is fed by the narrator's conclusion, where he speaks of brooding on certain words, \\"succubus for instance.\\" It suggests, in short, a kind of surreal narrative imagining, where the realism of the narrator's struggle with his book on Newton is confounded by the incursion of the strange, enigmatic and, at times, dreamlike inhabitants of Fern House. <br />\\"The Newton Letter\\" is a powerful, intricate and allusive work of imagination that demands the reader's careful and thoughtful attention. Banville shows, with remarkable skillfulness, how the narrator's imagined history of the inhabitants of Fern House is undermined by successive, incremental discoveries of the reality of their lives. At the same time, Banville draws on the gothic to lend his tale an imaginative element that is both a counterpoint to the real lives at Fern House and a touchstone to the enigma of the Newton letters. Like great works of literature, \\"The Newton Letter\\" is an ambiguous text open to many interpretations, the writing an elliptical treasure that allows the reader's imagination to run free in the interstices of Banville's creative field.	2002-04-13

I say \\"unreliable\\" quite consciously, because Freddie Montgomery says as much throughout the novel, another in a long line of remarkable fictions from John Banville, perhaps Ireland's finest living author. As Freddie relates at the end of his tale, \\"I thought of trying to publish this, my testimony. But no. I have asked Inspector Haslet to put it into my file, with the other, official fictions . . . [H]ow much of it is true? All of it. None of it. Only the shame.\\" <br />And what is Freddie Montgomery's story? An educated and brilliant academic, he married a young woman, Daphne, whom he met while teaching at Berkeley. He left academia for a dissolute life on a Mediterranean island. He became indebted there to apparently dark and unseemly characters, left his wife and young child behind, and returned to his family home in Ireland to obtain enough money to repay his debts. While in Ireland, he committed a brutal and seemingly inexplicable murder, fled the scene of his crime in a kind of \\"Lost Weekend\\" of drunken binging and obsession with his dark deed, and, ultimately, is apprehended and imprisoned. He writes the dark, powerful, obsessive interior monologue of \\"The Book of Evidence\\" while sitting in prison awaiting his trial.<br />The reader is never quite certain what to make of Freddie Montgomery. He is, indeed, a disturbed and disturbing narrator, someone who kills an innocent woman for no apparent reason, with chilling sang-froid. He bludgeons her with a hammer and then wonders, as if he were the victim: \\"How could this be happening to me-it was all so unfair. Bitter tears of self-pity squeezed into my eyes.\\"<br />Freddie Montgomery's narrative is lucid, but it's not clear that heis entirely sane. There is complete lack of feeling. He seems a psychopath, or worse. Perhaps he's simply mad. Perhaps he is commenting on himself when he says, \\"Madmen do not frighten me, or even make me uneasy. Indeed, I find that their ravings soothe me. I think it is because everything, from the explosion of a nova to the fall of dust in a deserted room, is to them of vast and equal significance, and therefore meaningless.\\" <br />There is a cold anomie that pervades Freddie's actions, his reflections, his feelings. It reminds the reader of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Notes from Underground\\". But there is also a dark humor and a sleight of hand working here that is absent from the great Russian master. Perhaps Irish sensibility is creeping in, perhaps just the penumbra of the post-modern. Whatever it is, it works.	2002-04-13

In Proust, the stunning use of memory and sense perception, as well as the stream of consciousness narrative of the great \\"roman fleuve\\", marked the auspicious beginnings of a modern sensibility and technique in fiction. Similarly, Joyce's difficult, blasphemous and similarly streaming novel, set in the course of a single day and emanating from the perceiving mind of its narrator, carried forward this sensibility and technique. It is not surprising, then, that Virginia Woolf, while writing her brilliant and innovative \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", was reading these two authors at the time, for Woolf's novel stands as yet another masterful work of modern sensibility and technique, a classic in its own right.<br />\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is set entirely during a single bright beautiful day in June, when Clarissa Dalloway is occupied by last minute preparations for a party she is having that evening. The wife of Richard Dalloway, a member of Parliament, Mrs. Dalloway is someone who is skilled, like an artist, at creating the perfect party. But the resemblances to a character and a narrative from Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope end there, for Woolf's fictional agenda is consciously modern and her technique is entirely that of interior monologue, omniscient description and, most markedly, a stream of consciousness narrative. Thus, Woolf's text gracefully and imaginatively moves from the interiority of Clarissa Dalloway's thoughts, perceptions and memories to those of the her former lover, Peter Walsh, who has just returned from India, to those of Septimus Warren Smith, a kind of literary doppelganger to Clarissa, a broken young man who served in World War I and suffers the horrible psychological effects of that conflict. It is, in particular, Septimus who darkly hovers over the gaiety of Mrs. Dalloway's day and, ultimately, brings that psychological darkness to Mrs. Dalloway's party.<br />Continually challenging the reader, Woolf's difficult, stream of consiousness narrative technique brings the reader into the minds of the characters, the language on the page telling a coherent and deeply sensitive story by describing sensations, memories, feelings. But it is worth the effort, for \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is truly one of the great works of Twentieth century English literature, a modern novel that can stand comfortably, albeit diminuitively, next to The Great Marcel and the creator of Bloom's Day.	2002-04-13

One day he goes out to buy cigarettes for her and is drugged and kidnapped by three black-hooded women. They keep him chained and captive in a stark white room for eighteen days, where he is emotionally and sexually abused, made to masturbate and perform, and, ultimately, mutilated, before being released. This occurs in the first half of the book and is narrated in the third-person. The man is never identified by name and the third-person narrative voice has the desired effect of distancing the reader from the victim's experience, making the reader feel the stark, dehumanizing experience of the dancer. This first part of the book is psychologically disturbing and erotically charged, in a dark sort of way; it is, in other words, a powerful piece of writing.<br />The second half of \\"The Book of Revelation\\" is written in the first person and relates what happens after the dancer is released by his captors. The victim remains unidentified by name, but the first-person narrative voice now brings the reader intimately into the mind of the dancer. Unfortunately, this part of the book requires the reader to suspend belief, the dancer's behavior seemingly at odds with what the claims of realism demand. Thus, upon his release, he makes his way back to his apartment, where he sees his girlfriend Brigitte. He does not tell her what has happened to him, nor does he tell anyone else. All he can say, at this point, is \\"how difficult it is, sometimes, to find the right words, or any words at all.\\" In some ways,his inability to communicate with his girlfriend (and others) is adumbrated at the beginning of the story, when he gets into an argument with Brigitte about her smoking, an argument that seems curiously devoid of any real interpersonal relationship. The effect of all this is to make the reader (or at least this reader) feel that the dancer's problems are as much a result of his own disfunctionality as they are of his bizarre kidnapping and captivity.<br />From this point forward, the story is propelled by the dancer's unmitigated attempt to find the three women who held him captive. His only touchstones are the identifying marks he had observed on the naked bodies of those women. He is thus compelled to embark on a misogynistic crusade to sleep with every woman he meets in the hope that he can identify one of them by the revelation of her nakedness. This is one of the possible meanings of the book's title, a meaning suggested by the book's epigraph: \\"Will there ever be anything other than the exterior and speculation in store for us? The skin, the surface--it is man's deepest secret.\\" <br />In the end, the dancer becomes a victim of his own obsession and his own inability to communicate, his inability to verbalize his experience and intimately share that experience with others. His redemption, if it will come at all, can only occur if he can overcome these inabilities, if he can \\"reveal\\" his kidnapping, his humiliation, his disturbed motivations; if he can tell his story, a book of revelation.<br />\\"The Book of Revelation\\" is an interesting book which keeps you turning the pages, wanting to know what happens in the end, whether the dancer will ever find his captors. Rupert Thomson is also a writer with great imaginative and writing ability. It is certainly a book worth spending time with, but not quite deserving of some of the critical acclaim it has received.	2002-04-13

While Fowlie's translations are workmanlike and somewhat unimaginative, they are generally faithful to the original French text. Moreover, because the original French version and the English translation are on facing pages, the reader can easily compare Fowlie's translation with the reader's own understanding and interpretation of the French text. In this respect, the book is particularly useful if you have some French fluency. <br />All translations are, by their nature, inauthentic since there is never a perfect correspondence between the resonant images and meanings of the original language and the new language into which a text is translated. Translation is, as one critic has said, \\"like kissing someone through a veil\\"; the sensations (meanings) of the original are occluded by the translative process. Recognizing this inevitable deficiency, all that a reader can ask is that a translation approximate, as closely as possible, the linguistic meaning of the original. Fowlie has achieved this, more so than many other translators of Rimbaud, who have corrupted the integrity of Rimbaud's original meanings by their own creative and symbolistic interpretive renderings. <br />Fowlie also has provided solid translations of Rimbaud's important letters, particularly the letters of May, 1871, to George Izambard and Paul Demeny which articulate Rimbaud's precocious and iconoclastic aesthetic view of the role of the poet. If the book has any real shortcoming, it is the truncated and relatively unintersting biographical section and a lack of detailed notes. However, those failings can be excused by the fact that Wylie's book achieves its main objective--bringing a complete text of Rimbaud's poems to the English speaking world. If you are studying Rimbaud and the biographical details of his early life, and you cannot read the original French, Wylie's collection is indispensable	2002-04-13

As it turns out, Mitya and Dima are moths (or are they humans?) drawn to the light in one of the many episodes in Pelevin's remarkable and imaginative satire of life in modern Russia. As Mitya explains, \\"if I wrote a novel about insects, that's how I'd represent their life: a village by the sea, darkness, and a few lamps shining in the darkness above this repulsive dancing. But to fly to those lamps means . . . [death].\\"<br />\\"The Life of Insects\\" is the novel Mitya would have written. Set in an old resort hotel by the sea, the story begins with intrigue: Sam, an American, meeting two Russians, Arthur and Arnold, while a loudspeaker blares, first in English (\\"The Voice of God, Bliss, Idaho, U.S.A.\\"), then in dreamy Ukrainian. The conversation among them immediately puzzles the reader, talk of hemoglobin, glucose, insecticides in the blood. \\"Sam looked around at his partners. Arthur and Arnold had turned into small mosquitoes of that miserable hue of gray familiar from prerevolutionary village huts, a color that in its time had reduced many a Russian poet to tears.\\" Arthur and Arnold, the Russian mosquitoes, in turn looked enviously at Sam, an American, \\"a light chocolate color, with long elegant legs a small tight belly, and wings swept back like a jet plane's.\\" <br />From this first episode, I realized I was in for a wild imaginative ride, and Pelevin did not disappoint me. Weaving his story from chapter to chapter with stunning imagination and verve, \\"The Life of Insects\\" is an episodic narrative of many lives, all of them adumbrating ideas (from Ancient Egyptian religion to Buddhism to Marcus Aurelius) and biting satirical commentary on modern life in Russia andAmerica. Appropriately described as a \\"satirical bestiary\\" by one reviewer, Pelevin's narrative tells not only of Sam, Arthur and Arnold, but also of a father and son, dung beetles, whose life is defined by the sphere of dung that they push along. \\"I know it's difficult to understand, but there simply isn't anything other than dung . . . and the purpose of life is to push it along in front of you.\\" And there are Mitya and Dima, the moths, whose lives are dominated by the need to fly towards the light. And there is Marina, the pregnant female ant whose daughter, Natasha, decides to become a fly. As her mother watches, Natasha leaves her cocoon, \\"and instead of a modest ant's body, Marina saw a typical young fly in a short sexy dress with spangles.\\"<br />\\"The Life of Insects\\" is the work of a remarkable imagination, a biting satire that, at the same time, is laden with insightful reflection and commentary. I highly recommend it!	2002-04-13

Unfortunately, while the short memoir of how Fowlie first came to connect these two figures is interesting and worthy of a short journalistic piece, the bulk of this book contains nothing more than truncated and regurgitated biographical sketches of Rimbaud and Morrison and disparate commentary on some of their writing. <br />Fowlie, who published an English translation of Rimbaud's collected poems in 1966, first heard of Morrison when he received a letter from him in 1968 thanking him for the English translation. Morrison implied that Rimbaud was an important writer for him: \\"I don't read French that easily . . . I am a rock singer and your book travels around with me.\\" Fowlie didn't know of Morrison until, many years later, he heard some of the music and lyrics of The Doors and recognized the influence of Rimbaud on the writing of Morrison. Fowlie's memoir relates how his discovery of these connections led to a series of lectures on Rimbaud and Morrison, lectures which were (not surprisingly!) received with enthusiasm and interest by his young college students at Duke and elsewhere. <br />Fowlie's discussion of Rimbaud's poetry, in addition to being cursory, can only be understood with a copy of his poems close at hand; without reading the poems in their entirety, Fowlie's commentary is largely unintelligible. With respect to Morrison, Fowlie does nothing more than regurgitate biographical details gleaned from other authors and discuss a few of Morrison's poems. Again, understanding the discussion of the poems suffers if you don't have the texts of Morrison's poems available. <br />While Fowlie's prose is wonderful and his brief anecdote of the way that Morrison and Rimbaud connected in Fowlie's own life interesting, the bulk of the book in unremarkable and derivative.	2002-04-13

Sebald's \\"The Rings of Saturn\\" is categorized as a work of fiction, although it is often difficult to discern what is, in fact, imagined and what is real. Dreamlike, mysterious, sublime, enigmatic, strange--all these adjectives appropriately have been used to describe Sebald's remarkable work of literary, philosophical and historical imagination. <br />\\"The Rings of Saturn\\" is a first person narrative of the author's year-long ramble through East Anglia beginning in August, 1992. It is a \\"ramble\\" not only in the physical sense--a walker's tour and observation of the natural surroundings and history of the land--but also in the mental sense, being a series of historical, philosophical and psychological digressions triggered by everything Sebald sees and experiences on his journey. The landscapes are, thus, both interior and exterior. They are also landscapes that exist not only in the present, but extend back into the past and forward into the future; both natural and mental history become trans-temporal, the ground for a dreamlike ponderousness that, at times, takes the reader's breath away.<br />\\"The Rings of Saturn\\" is, in many ways, a dark relation of the author's experience, for he \\"became preoccupied not only with the unaccustomed sense of freedom but also with the paralysing horror that had come over [him] at various times when confronted with the traces of destruction, reaching far back into the past, that were evident even in that remote place.\\" He ends up, at the end of his journey--\\"a year to the day after [he] began his tour\\"--in a total state of immobility in a Norwich hospital. It is here that the book begins, that Sebald \\"began in [his] thoughts to write these pages.\\"<br />Filled with grainy and sometimes mysterious, disturbing and imaginatively illustrative black and white photographs of the narrator's thoughts and experiences, \\"The Rings of Saturn\\" is equally fertile in flights of imaginative and historical reflection. Thus, the author's stay in the Norwich hospital leads to a digressive exploration of the obscure writings of the seventeenth century writer Thomas Browne, whose skull was at one time kept in the hospital's museum, an old-time cabinet of wonders. This, in turn, runs into a discursis on Rembrandt's painting, \\"The Anatomy Lesson\\". Reaching the seaside leads to an exploration of the history of herring fishing. The dim recollection of a PBS documentary on the life of Roger Casement, a recollection floating in the narrator's mind as he drifts off to sleep, leads to a detailed exploration of Joseph Conrad's experiences in the Belgian Congo, where Conrad had briefly encountered Casement. <br />The digressions go on and on. \\"The Rings of Saturn\\" is, in a sense, like being in the mind of Sebald during the course of time, a mind experiencing reality, dreaming illusion, and speculating on nature, man, literature, and time. The imaginary becomes real; the real, imaginary. Thus, tracts of Borges are cited as authority, treated as valid scientific works, when Sebald discusses time. \\"The denial of time, so the tract on Orbius Tertius tells us, is one of the key tenets of the philosophical schools of Tlon. According to this principle, the future exists only in the shape of our present apprehensions and hopes, and the past merely as memory.\\" <br />Conflating the real and imaginary, the historical and the fictional, \\"The Rings of Saturn\\" represents an obsessive and powerful work of literature, a narrative that shows the uncanny ways in which imagination can be used to connect our lives with the world and with the past, even though \\"we know that we shall never be able to fathom the imponderables that govern our course through life.\\"	2002-04-13

This place is ineffable; Rudolf Otto, in his memorable book, \\"The Idea of the Holy\\", referred to it as the \\"numinous\\". Nathan Englander, in his collection of stories, \\"For the Relief of Unbearable Urges\\", captures this place in the best of his stories. In \\"The Tumblers\\", a band of Hasidim escape a train to the death camps, ending up instead on a train of circus performers. While \\"clumsy as Jews\\", they improvise a tumbling act which leads to a magical and redemptive outcome that leaves the reader breathless and disturbed. In \\"The Twenty-seventh Man\\", Englander tells the tale of Pinchas Pelovits, a writer who has never published--a writer known only to himself. That is, until the day Pinchas is rounded up with \\"an eminent selection of Europe's surviving Yiddish literary community\\" as part of Stalin's purges. In this setting, in a room no bigger than a closet, Pinchas Pelovits encounters the numinous, finds an audience, and generates meaning for the desperate situation of his cellmates. <br />These are only two of the nine stories, perhaps the two best. Each story in this vividly imagined and often disturbingly brilliant collection seeks to capture the meeting of the ordinary with the extraordinary, the ineffable. Each story seeks to provide a locus where religious belief (in this case, Orthodox Judaism) inscribes meaning in the mundane, and sometimes desperate, lives of its characters. While Englander doesn't always succeed, and there are as many mediocre stories in this collection as there are remarkable ones, \\"For the Relief of Unbearable Urges\\" is, at its best, the work of nascent literary genius, perhaps the beginning of a remarkable career.	2002-04-13

Thus, they were often likened to the old-time \\"cabinet of curiosities\\", displays of disparate and unusual artifacts which bore no relationship to one another. A visitor to these museums often saw things which, in later years, became the staple of carnival side shows.<br />In \\"A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities\\", Jan Bondeson, a British physician who also holds a doctorate in experimental medicine, has written a fascinating and brilliantly executed textual analogue to the cabinet of curiousities. In successive chapters, Bondeson details, among other curiousities, the histories of spontaneous human combustion, apparent death and premature burial, maternal impressions (the belief that what a pregnant woman sees and experiences can cause corresponding alterations in the unborn fetus), and people with tails. Bondeson tells true, and not so true, stories of dwarfs and giants. He relates the story of Mary Toft, the English woman who, in 1726, was believed to have given birth to seventeen rabbits. And, of course, such a compendium of marvels would not be complete without a bearded lady--in this case, Bondeson narrates the remarkable life story of Julie Pastrana, who made appearances throughout the world in the mid-nineteenth century and whose mummified body (along with the mummified corpse of her infant child) continued to draw crowds at fairs and carnivals many years after her death. <br />While these topics may seem grotesque, even repulsive, Bondeson writes with deep feeling for his human subjects and a wry sense of humor for the foibles of his sometimes credulous profession. He also integrates these seemingly freakish and disparate topics into remarkably lucid and informative discussions of their place in the medical, scientific, religious, and literary discourse of their times.	2002-04-13

Joyce wrote the first of the fifteen stories in this collection, \\"Sisters,\\" in Ireland in 1904. The story was published in August of that year under the pseudonym \\"Stephen Daedalus.\\" Joyce wrote the last, longest and most famous of the stories, \\"The Dead,\\" in Rome in 1907. The stories were published in the book known as \\"Dubliners\\" in 1914. While there are many editions of \\"Dubliners\\" in print, the definitive edition of the work is generally considered to be the corrected text prepared by Robert Scholes in consultation with Richard Ellman, Joyce's biographer. Random House publishes the Scholes edition under its Modern Library imprint and I recommend this edition.<br />\\"Dubliners\\" stands as one of the Ur-texts of modernism, a startlingly original collection of stories set in turn-of-the-century Dublin that began the Joycean literary project. That project subsequently moved through the increasingly difficult, and characteristically modernist, iterations of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\" \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"Finnegan's Wake.\\" Like those succeeding texts, the interested reader can find thousands of pages of commentary on \\"Dubliners,\\" the study of Joyce's works being akin to a Talmudic undertaking, an undertaking that can, if one chooses, occupy an entire life.<br />Joyce once commented that the stories of \\"Dubliners\\" constitute a \\"chapter of moral history\\" that represents the \\"first step towards the spiritual liberation of [Ireland].\\" He also said, \\"I call the series 'Dubliners' to betray the soul of that hemiplegia or paralysis which many consider a city.\\" The stories are, in other words, inherently critical (although also, at times, appreciative) of the Dublin life that Joyce abandoned, living and writing as an expatriate in Paris, Trieste, Rome, and Zurich for nearly the entirety of his adult life.<br />The stories operate on two levels. On one level, the stories are realistic narratives of every day life in Dublin. On another level, however, the stories are suffused with symbolism, with recurring, allusive images of spiritual, sexual and political meanings that mark a departure from nineteenth century literary realism and make \\"Dubliners\\" an enduring, and deservedly canonical, modernist narrative.<br />The first story, \\"Sisters,\\" begins with a striking example of the tone of the stories in \\"Dubliners.\\" A young boy stands, in the evening, looking up at the shadows flickering through the window of an upstairs room where a priest is dying: <br />\\"Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word 'paralysis'. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word 'gnomon' in the Euclid and the word 'simony' in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.\\" <br />Thus, a vivid, realistic image appears in the reader's mind, but so does a collection of words that suggest meanings and themes that go far beyond the real, that capture physical and intellectual and religious undercurrents, the inner life of a young boy living in Dublin.<br />\\"Sisters\\" is a brilliant story, as is \\"The Dead\\" and nearly every other story in \\"Dubliners\\" (excluding, perhaps, one or two, the worst being \\"After the Race,\\" a story that Joyce reluctantly included in the collection). Realistic in its narratives, richly allusive in its language and symbolism, \\"Dubliners\\" is one of a handful of story collections that truly deserves the label \\"classic\\" and should be read and studied by every serious reader.	2002-04-13

Thus, the noun precedes him--\\"sadist\\"-and the adjective-\\"sadistic\\"-our language itself fixing the man's transgressions before the fact of his biography, making the biography appear superfluous in light of the enormity of the man's crimes. But there was, indeed, a real human being behind the noun and the adjective--Donatien Alphonse Francois, Marquis de Sade--and Francine du Plessix Gray's \\"At Home With the Marquis de Sade\\" provides an insightful, sympathetic, well written picture of that human being in all his complexity.<br />Gray's biography concentrates largely on the relationship de Sade had with two women-his first wife, Renee-Pelagie de Sade, and his indomitable mother-in-law, Madame de Montreuil. De Sade's wife remained a constant companion to the erstwhile Marquis for more than a quarter century, suffering his sexual excesses (including dalliances with her younger sister, Anne-Prospere), the ensuing scandals and, ultimately, the many years of imprisonment. His mother-in-law, a social climbing women of fierce and irrepressible will who at first found the Marquis charming, ultimately became his worst oppressor, driven like the Eumenides to avenge de Sade's seduction of her virginal younger daughter, Anne-Prospere. She was, in Gray's characterization, a woman who exemplified \\"primitive female fury, a rage that is unquestioning in its self-righteousness.\\" And it was Madame de Montreuil who unstintingly worked to keep the Marquis imprisoned for over thirteen years, freedom coming only with the fall of the Bastille in 1789, when the Marquis was forty-nine years old. <br />Gray deftly uses correspondence and other contemporary historical documents to illuminate de Sade's life, including his prominent involvement as \\"Citizen Louis Sade\\" in theRevolutionary government of France, his role in saving his hated mother-in-law from the guillotine in 1793, and his subsequent incarceration in the Charenton asylum from 1799 until his death in 1814, where he carried on as an author and director of numerous theatrical productions staged by the inmates of the asylum and by professional actors. Gray also puts de Sade's early life and sexual excesses in context, showing how his actions, while transgressive and freely chosen, were also the product of a society and an upbringing which allowed libertinism to flourish among the pre-Revolutionary French nobility and clergy. Finally, Gray provides illuminating, albeit brief, discussions of de Sade's literary works, putting his writings in historical context and showing that the excesses of the man's life did not attain the excesses of his imagination.<br />\\"At Home With the Marquis de Sade\\" is, in short, a carefully researched, lucidly written life of the historical figure who has come to symbolize sexual transgression, a biography that eludes the imprisonment of culturally fixed meanings to get at the real life behind the \\"Sadist\\".	2002-04-13

In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of 'Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.<br />\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.<br />From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America. <br />From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not somuch the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America. <br />Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award.	2002-04-13

It remains a barbarous bloody act. . . . The sacrificial idea which invested the act with sanctity in former days has no significance for us.  However tenaciously religious sentiment may have clung to it formerly, at present, its only supports are habit and fear, to which we certainly do not wish to erect any shrines.\\"<br />Notwithstanding Geiger's private views on the subject, his public position was quite different when, in 1843, a group of Frankfurt laymen formed the Society for the Friends of Reform and declared, among other things, that the long-standing rite of circumcision was null and void.  Like other members of the emerging Reform rabbinate of mid-nineteenth century Germany, Geiger could not consider abrogating the rite, even though every other aspect of Jewish religious practice was subject to reconsideration in the light of modernity.  As Lawrence Hoffman notes in the opening chapter of \\"Covenant of Blood: Circumcision and Gender in Rabbinic Judaism,\\" when discussing the actions of the German Reform rabbinate in response to the Frankfurt laymen and during three historic meetings in the period between 1844 and 1846:<br />\\"Rabbis apparently found it possible to commit nothing less than liturgical surgery on their time-honored prayer book; they could cancel age-old mourning and wedding customs; they even declared the Talmud no longer binding.  They had no trouble dispensing with Hebrew and cutting off their ties to a Jewish Land of Israel.  They would even think seriously of declaring a marriage with a non-Jew `not forbidden.'  But they could not even consider abrogating circumcision.  Moreover, they could not even agree that males who are not circumcised are still Jews!  Nowhere else, to the best of my knowledge, were the reformers so adamantly tied to their past as in the case of circumcision.\\" <br />Indeed, the atavistic power of tradition almost prevented Professor Hoffman himself from publishing this fascinating and compelling exploration of the role of circumcision in Judaism, a work that he largely completed as early as 1987 (nearly ten years before its publication).  Struggling to find the light of day, he admits to having erased the text from his computer and then lost the only hard copy in his possession.  In the end, fortunately for those interested in better understanding the real meanings of Judaism, he decided \\"it is better to come to terms with the crawly creatures in the basement than to pretend that they are not there.\\"<br />\\"Covenant of Blood\\" methodically explores the development, importance and meaning of circumcision within Judaism.  Tracing the rite from its original textual origins in the story of Abraham, Professor Hoffman combines close analysis of Jewish texts with anthropological theory (particularly the seminal and insightful writings of Mary Douglas and Claude Levi-Strauss) to demonstrate how circumcision evolved into a binary system that served to reinforce Jewish patriarchy while simultaneously marginalizing women.  It is a system that developed initially from the dichotomy between the salvific meaning ascribed to the blood of circumcision and the impurity of the blood of menstruation.  From this dichotomy, Professor Hoffman demonstrates how the rabbinic system evolved in a manner that effectively excluded women from the religious culture of Judaism (while recognizing that the preserved rabbinic texts do not always reflect the reality of cultural practice).  In a characteristic passage showing how \\"Covenant of Blood\\" relies upon anthropological analysis to illuminate Jewish theology (and which reminds me of some of the linguistic observations of Judith Tannen), Professor Hoffman summarizes why Jewish women were excluded from compliance with positive commandments dependent on time:<br />\\"[W]ith regard to gender, the rabbinic system presents a cultural diad of in control/out of control.  Men are controlled, they learn the system of controls, and they exercise control to transform the environment; women are the opposite:  they are out of control; they are nature; they are wild, loose, unable (by temperament) to master the application of those commandments that must be done precisely `on time.'  Therefore, the system necessarily exempts them from those commandments.  In a word, men are nature transformed by culture; women are nature, dependent on culture, that is, on men.  They enter men's domain at times like marriage (thus requiring one-sixth of the Mishnah to tell their men how to deal with them), but they are never fully `culturated.'  They do not learn Torah and are not obliged to effect culture's-that is, Torah's-transformation of nature.  Using Levi-Strauss's celebrated categorization scheme loosely, we can say that men, as culture, are the cooked while women, as nature, are the raw.\\"<br />Tracing the circumcision rite through history, Professor Hoffman demonstrates through careful textual and philological analysis how women were finally excluded entirely from participation in the rite by the Medieval rabbinate, making circumcision an exclusively male ritual in the synagogue.<br />For those who view Judaism as revealed religion, and Torah and its Talmudic elaborations as revealed texts, \\"Covenant of Blood\\" will appear to be nothing more than heresy.  Similarly, for those who unquestioningly accept Judaic tradition and practice without regard to its origins and effects, there will continue to be a cultural, if not religious, imperative for circumcision, \\"the sine qua non of Jewish identity throughout time.\\"  But for those willing to examine the religious ritual of circumcision in the light ofreason, Professor Hoffman has written a text worthy of careful reading and consideration.	2002-04-08
