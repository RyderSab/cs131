Not Penelope  Fitzgerald!  I've enjoyed THE BOOK SHOP, OFFSHORE,  and THE BLUE FLOWER, each so different that I'm amazed the same author  penned them. <br />THE BEGINNING OF SPRING is my most recent Fitzgerald  reading, and it may be my favorite so far.  Frank Reid, the main character,  runs a printing company in Moscow, a business he inherited from his father.   Frank was born and brought up in Moscow although he is still considered a  foreigner because his parents were English.  Frank was sent back to England  to polish his education and while there he married Nellie, a woman who felt  constrained by the narrowness of her English hometown.  She was ready to  leave that town, but she wasn't prepared for Moscow and could never quite  adjust.  One day, she gathers up their three children and leaves on the  train to return to England.  Not being able to cope with the children, she  sends them back to Frank before she continues onto England. Frank is  mystified by his wife's actions and doesn't know if he will be able to cope  with the children either.  <br />This is the story of a domestic crisis, but  the backdrop of unrest brewing in Russia clearly presages the Revolution.   The year is 1913.  Frank doesn't know how much longer he can maintain his   business, and he's not sure where his sympathies lie. <br />Ms. Fitzgerald  does have one trick:  she seems to lead the reader one direction, and then  bam! you  find that's not where she was headed afterall.  I thought THE  BEGINNING OF SPRING was quietly wonderful, but when it concluded I found  that it just seemed quiet and the resolution was resounding.	1998-09-20

Besides the Queen  herself, there were Walter Ralegh, Sir Francis Drake, Ben Jonson, William   Shakespeare, and not least of all, Christopher  Marlowe.  <br />Marlowe was a  brilliantly creative playwright and poet, and was more popular in his own  time than  William Shakespeare.  If he had not been murdered, it's possible  that he would've completely eclipsed Shakespeare.<br />Charles Nicholl does an  admirable job of explaining Christopher Marlowe's complicated  personality  (he was a scholar, homosexual, atheist) and the difficult situations he was   always getting involved in (killing a man in a  fight, accusations of  blasphemy, and spying).   The spying was probably the real reason he was   murdered.  The &quot;official&quot; story that he was  killed in  self-defense by Ingram Frizer over a disputed food &amp; drink bill when  Marlowe pulled  a dagger on him just seems a little too convenient.  Frizer  was just one of several sordid characters with whom Marlowe associated, and  all of them were connected to Sir Francis  and Thomas Walsingham, brothers  who definitely were involved in spying.      <br />Mr. Nicholl's book, THE  RECKONING, is as entertaining as any spy thriller or mystery novel.  He  does not concentrate on or try to interpret Marlowe's literary works, but  his interpretations of Christopher Marlowe's life and murder really make  sense!	1998-08-29

I'm puzzled that they are unremittingly depressing. <br />Mr. Lamb's book, I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE, is no  exception.

Stereotypes may often be quite cruel, but they also may hold kernels of truth that are quite  funny if we can laugh at ourselves.  Paul Theroux's The Kingdom by the Sea affectionately  recounts his experiences with the wonderful and  slightly eccentric subjects of the British Isles.  <br />Theroux had lived for years in London, but he had  never really got out into the countryside to meet the &quot;real&quot; people.  So he decided to walk the  coastline starting in Margate and then going clockwise on the map along the edges of England, Wales and Scotland (with a brief foray into Northern Ireland)and winding up back in London. It was 1982, and the prime subject of conversation in the pubs, B&amp;Bs, and on television was the  invasion of the Falklands by the &quot;dastardly&quot;  Argentines.  <br />Theroux observes the raucous behavior of leatherclad and shaved-head youths on the train to Margate, and how most of the other passengers studiously ignore them.  He notices that ! ! the  average Britons are so excessively polite that they are the only people in the world who say &quot;sorry&quot; to you if you step on their toes.  Theroux doesn't know quite what to make of this, but he begins to wonder if British shyness and  reserve may be rooted in depression.  Every where he goes, people seem to be depressed.  They probably have plenty reasons to be depressed, but getting them to tell the reasons is next to impossible.  Instead, the wry, ironic wit that  has become a stereotype of the British keeps showing up.  The love of &quot;small passions&quot; and  the sublimely ridiculous are apparent from the  thousands of lined-up &quot;chalets&quot; on the shore to  the shabby &quot;holiday camps.&quot;  <br />Although, Paul Theroux can come across as crabby, he is wonderfully observant, and you get the  feeling that he is not only vastly amused by the British &quot;national character,&quot; he has great affection for the people.	1998-07-17

What a surprise!<br />Instead of some overblown macho stud like James Bond, the protagonist is Charles Latimer, a quiet English academic, who becomes intrigued by the  death of an arch-felon, Dimitrios Makropoulos. He decides to find out more about this Dimitrios, and winds up traversing Europe from Istanbul to  Paris.<br />There are no gimmicks in Ambler's writing; he  presents a mystery and unravels it.  Supposedly, Ambler is responsible for the &quot;modern&quot; spy thriller.  If so, he did it well, but the genre  devolved after him.  A Coffin for Dimitrios is a  superb book whether it is classified a mystery,  thriller, or whatever.	1998-07-14

A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown.  This is perhaps  the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.<br />Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly  unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.<br />While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself.  I went to see the movie.  I was  appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit.  I already had a fixed  notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations. If I had read the book or seen the movie without any expectations, possibly I would've liked them better.	1998-07-14

I was so annoyed with this assignment that I wrote a vehemently nasty review. The teacher was vastly amused.  He suggested that  I read Road to Wigan Pier.  I couldn't see anyway to niggle out of reading it, so I settled down to read it as perfunctorily as possible and still be able to convince the teacher that I had given it due thought.  Instead, as I read, I became enthralled by Orwell's descriptions of life in a bleak industrial town in the north of England.  I gained new respect for Eric Blair; I still didn't like 1984, but I understood better where he was coming from and why he wrote it.  <br />I've thought about Road to Wigan Pier many times in the intervening years, and I just recently  re-read it.  It is still just as powerful and  despairing.  The non-fiction beats the fiction any day.  I have an insig! ! htful teacher to thank for recommending this book.	1998-07-13

Islands were particularly elusive, and  many of them had a habit of wandering around in  the ocean!  Occasionally, someone would bump into  an island; think a new discovery was made; give it a name; and then spread the news to mapmakers. Some islands got discovered and named several times.  Other islands were imagined or invented. Imagine the confusion of a poor navigator trying  to figure out where he was if he was relying on a  map drawn from hearsay.  <br />Phantom Islands of the Atlantic is filled with  quaint maps and illustrations.  Mr. Johnson's  narrative is breezy and entertaining yet well-researched and informative.  This book is a delight!	1998-06-30

This book really brought home my own experiences with &quot;innumeracy.&quot;  Back in the 'sixties when I  was in high school, I enjoyed mathematics and  decided to take trigonometry; I was the only girl in the class.  Mid-semester I transferred to another school, and I was told upon enrolling that I couldn't take trigonometry as it was a &quot;boys only&quot; class!  What a flap that would cause now! Instead, I meekly accepted this and was put in a  sociology class.  Grrrr!  It still makes me mad, mostly at myself for being so docile.  Perhaps things have improved for young women in the intervening years, but I'm afraid that too many otherwise bright women have the mistaken notion that they &quot;just aren't good at math.&quot;  <br />Mr. Paulos' book is wonderfully witty, and it's  obvious that he loves his subject.  I wish that  I'd had him for a math teacher rather than the  football coach who was doing double duty as the  high school algebra teacher.	1998-06-29

I did see it on the western horizon a couple of times, and it was interesting but not particularly exciting.  Reading the tales of other comets was much more fun for me.  I heard my grandmother talk about the 1910 appearance of  Halley's Comet, and how it frightened so many  people.  Her father was a Lutheran minister, and many of his congregation came to him asking if it was the end of the world.  His answer was, &quot;If it is the end of the world, there's nothing we can  do about.  I'm going to bed.  Good-night.&quot;  Even though we know so much more about comets nowadays, they are still a frightening phenomenon for many people, and some even go crazy.  Witness the suicide cult in California who thought a spaceship would be accompanying Hale-Bopp especially to pick them up!  But even though Hale-Bopp was a dud (at least for the layperson), I think this book is  very enlightening for the historical perspective. The author's enthusiasm for his subject makes  his writing very entertaining, and he doesn't  bore the average person with technical jargon and erudition.	1998-06-20

I had a vague idea that the  characters were based on real people, but I wasn't very curious about them.  Then I ran across this  book.  I meant to give it a desultory glance, but I got hooked by the charming George Leroy Parker aka Butch Cassidy and his hothead partner, Harry Longabaugh aka the Sundance Kid.  I found myself peering at the photographs and thinking, &quot;They were real!&quot;  I was particularly entranced with  the mysterious Etta Place (if that was actually her name).  This is a very entertaining account of obsessive sleuthing.  The author and her husband even went to Bolivia and witnessed the  digging up of remains of an outlaw purported to  be Sundance.  Ms. Meadows reaches no definite  conclusions, and that's just fine with me.  Perhaps if we knew exactly what happened to them, they wouldn't be so intriguing.	1998-06-15

A particularly rainy season filled the lake to capacity and the already-stressed dam gave way. Mr. McCullough begins quietly by describing the  ordinariness of the lives of the people in Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1889, and then he  shifts to the dissolving dam.  It is truly horrifying to realize that it was doomsday for those people.  The description of the wall of  water surging down the valley, sweeping everything in its path along with it, including the buildings and inhabitants of Johnstown, until it finally  slammed into the railroad bridge is one of the  most gut-wrenching things I've ever read.  The  aftermath was indescribable but reporters from  all over the country tried, and their tales in  the newspapers captured the minds of the American people who rushed to aid the victims. Today, we  are jaded by overexposure to the media, but we  can still be shocked by the callous disregard that the rich men had for the safety of the &quot;little&quot; people in the valley, and we can still admire the indomitable spirit of the survivors. This is a superb narrative of a horrible event. My highest praise goes to Mr. McCullough.	1998-06-15
