Books	4	4	6	N	N	An Interesting & Somewhat Superficial Book about Dying	The title of this novel is a perfect description for the story. Not only because the book is about someone dying, but because, as the title implies, it is a \\"superficial\\" look at life and death. <br /> <br />Written in first-person narrative but containing two main characters, we get the story of both Lily, a single mother of two, and Michael, her best friend. Lily, an outspoken columnist, gets assigned a column about breast cancer awareness. This means she has to go and get a mammogram. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the results come back positive, and after a biopsy, it's discovered that Lily has aggressive cancer. After a few chemotherapy sessions, it's clear that she is going to die. She decides that Michael will care for her children when she's gone, not her deadbeat ex-husband. Meanwhile Michael is trying to write the story of his life, which has been a lot of violence due to his being gay. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, as it was full of good advice on making sure there is plenty of love in your life, as well as a suggestion that we should live life to the fullest. I did however feel the book was \\"superficial\\" because it only scratched the surface on Lily's battle with cancer, her dying, etc. The story was very short and rarely got into details or too much into the characters' minds. <br /> <br />Lily and Michael as characters were great however and I was rooting for them throughout the book. Erica excels at creating larger-than-life characters. <br /> <br />I couldn't understand, however, why Michael's story about being betrayed by his crush, and being assaulted so many times because of his sexual orientation, was in the book. There is a lot of violence and cringe-worthy details in his part of the story. As a matter of fact, I had to skim some of the parts because it was just bad. Why was senseless violence thrown in with a cancer story? I have no idea. And, all of the characters in this book, save for Lily's ex-husband, were too-good-to-be true and seemed overly perfect and loving. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a good read that will make you think about living, dying and loving. If you are looking for a meaningful yet light look at one woman's battle with breast cancer, this book is for you.	2005-09-30

This is the predicament our main character Maggie finds herself in when her best friend Olivia announces she is getting married and that Maggie is going to be the head bridesmaid. <br /> <br />Maggie and Olivia had both struggled with being overweight all through childhood, but Olivia had a successful gastric bypass surgery and is now nearing a size 2. Meanwhile Maggie is still the same. She is excited about being Olivia's bridesmaid, but wonders why Olivia is settling for something less than what she deserves. Her new fianc might be rich and extremely handsome, but he doesn't seem very emotionally available. <br /> <br />At the same time, Maggie finds herself at that point in her life where things are changing unexpectedly. After getting kicked out of her apartment, she is faced with finding a new place. Her job as a waitress is getting old, and she finds herself longing to put her degree to good use. When new opportunities arise, Maggie must find the courage to move on. All the while she is feeling left out of Olivia's wedding plans and trying to juggle a potential new man in her life. <br /> <br />Just how far will Maggie go to continue to try and fit into Olivia's new life? Will she continue to let herself be treated as a doormat, or will she find the strength to stand up to her old friend? <br /> <br />I loved this book. Not only was it an excellent \\"bigger girl lit\\" read, but it told an excellent story of a childhood friendship on the rocks. I loved how Maggie was faced with so many life changes and choices, and although she didn't always make the right decision, she stayed true throughout the book. There were many threads to the plot in this novel and they all were tied together seamlessly in the end. There was all the ingredients to an awesome chick lit read: humor, weight issues, subtle romance, friendship angst, career choices, and more. <br /> <br />Maggie didlet herself get run over a bit in this book, but it wasn't quite to the point where you wanted to scream at her. Considering that is usually a major pet peeve of mine, it didn't distract much from this excellent novel. <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend this book to all readers.	2005-09-30

After all, she had never gone out with Teddy, the now-famous rock star in question. She doesn't want to believe it. After all, she likes to keep her life organized and complication-free. She doesn't have time for this. <br /> <br />But unfortunately her brother is determined to push her into the spotlight and shed light on the fact that yes, she is the \\"Janey\\" in the song. Jane meanwhile decides one night on a whim to live it up. After all, how often is a famous love song written for you? Her life quickly turns into talk shows and interviews. But are things what they really seem? And what about Drew, the guy at her office that seems sort-of interested in her? <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed Off the Record. The characterization is excellent, the plot believable and fun, and the story line unique and refreshing. O'Connell's writing style is fast becoming one of my favorites- she has a knack for telling an excellent story with just a hint of subtle romance and uncertainty present in the background. Best of all, Jane was a great main character. She was smart, funny and quirky enough for anyone to like. <br /> <br />Other than a tiny bit of predictability found in the story, I couldn't find much I didn't love about this book. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book for a fun abd thoroughly enjoyable read.	2005-09-30

Jane, main heroine of this novel, sure does. With a currently passionless marriage, a catty coworker trying to edge her out of the picture, an unrequited crush on the handsome Evan, and a promotion that seems out of her grasp, Billy Rendell has plenty of things going wrong. <br /> <br />After a trip to her therapist Blinda, who gives her a ceramic frog that is supposed to make her dreams/wishes come true, Billy goes home, puts the frog on her nightstand, and promptly forgets about it. <br /> <br />That is, until her life changes overnight. Suddenly her husband is loving and passionate again, she has that promotion, and Evan can't seem to get enough of her. Billy is puzzled, but ecstatic. Things are finally going her way. <br /> <br />But Billy realizes too late that getting everything you want can also cause problems. Realizing she's in over her head, she tries to get rid of the magical frog. Problem is, she can't... <br /> <br />There is a reason Laura Caldwell is one of my favorite authors - her books have been a perfect 10 so far, and this one is no exception. With wonderful, real-life characters, and an original story line that somehow manages to be realistic despite its magical quality, The Night I Got Lucky was a fabulous read that I simply couldn't put down once I started. Characterization is one of Caldwell's greatest strength, and it shines in this novel. <br /> <br />I couldn't find anything in this book that I didn't like. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel to everyone, especially chick lit fans.	2005-08-27

Alex realizes she must get over her resentment for her wayward father (who refuses to pay for her college tuition), and make an effort in school of she might not graduate with her class. <br /> <br />\\"Faking 19\\" was a very engaging and fast-paced read. The author does a great job of getting the reader into Alex's head and make them feel her emotions. The story is well-written, capturing the girls' teen angst perfectly. Overall a great book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the Gossip Girl series and other teen books.	2005-08-26

After absolutely loving Jackie Rose's first novel Slim Chance, I was eagerly anticipating her second novel Marrying Up. The premise sounded intriguing and a bit naughty: a woman who decides to marry a rich man, and write a book telling how to do it. <br /> <br />Holly Hastings is the main heroine in this book. She writes obituaries for a living, and one day after writing her own obituary (out of mostly boredom), she realizes that she hasn't really accomplished anything yet in her life. Heading full speed ahead to 30, she realizes that she needs to figure out what to do with her life - and fast. After a few sessions with her therapist, she decides that desperately wants to be a writer. Not only that, but she figures that she needs to marry a very rich man to support her while she pursues her dreams. <br /> <br />So off she goes with her best friend George to Northern California, where all the rich men supposedly live. Holly and George move into a crumbling house with the adorable Remy, who Holly immediately is attracted to figures is gay. The two women don't waste any time hitting the bars and meeting some well-to-do men. But does money substitute charm and chemistry? Will Holly and George get in over their heads? <br /> <br />Marrying Up was a very satisfying read. Once again, Jackie Rose created a flawed but easy-to-like character who doesn't always make the right choices, and in fact often makes bad ones. But somehow you still like her. The story line was indeed intriguing. I enjoyed the author's writing style this second time around as well - she kept me turning pages effortlessly until the end. <br /> <br />The only downfalls to this novel were that it took a while for the story to really get moving. Also, in regards to the original story line of the novel - it seemed to stray off subject a bit. This book really isn't about marrying a millionaire much at all. <br /> <br />However, I highly recommend this book for enjoyable reading to any and all chick lit fans.	2005-08-12
US	28822725	R34FIRTFZ1W0EH	0446576883	599707212	Adored	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A little bit of romance, chick lit and glamour	I confess to enjoying rich, glamorous, dishy novels filled with cold and calculating characters from time to time. I anticipated that Adored would be such a novel, especially from the author's note on the back cover. <br /> <br />There are many characters in this novel, but one major one seems to be Siena McMahon, a spoiled, beautiful girl. Shipped off to boarding school in England, she plots her escape and tries (unsuccessfully) to get expelled. More than anything, she wants to move to Hollywood and become famous. She manages to leave school to do some modeling work. Meanwhile back on the home front, her extremely rich and powerful father Pete McMahan is furious, and threatens to disown her from the family will unless she continues in school. It doesn't deter Siena, and so she is off. <br /> <br />Many side plots and threads weave their way into this intricate novel. Siena's and her half-brother Hunter reunite; Siena acknowledges that she has feelings for Max, who she once professed to hate. But unfortunately, her career, jealousy and misunderstanding come between them. Siena finds another man who promises to further her career. Problem is, he's cold and cruel. <br /> <br />At over 500 pages, Adored was a long but pretty good read. (Any novel that I can get through that is over 300 pages, is good). I didn't like Siena much after the first several chapters, because she was so spoiled, selfish and vain. Her father was a complete and utter jerk; her brother Hunter was too nice. The major thing I liked about this book is that it kept me turning pages. Surprisingly, the novel was a bit predictable. It had all the elements of a juicy read: glamour, love, hate, revenge, philandering, success, pain, sorrow, and more. It was all pulled together well. But something was missing. It was extremely hard to care about these characters, because they were mostly all selfish and vain. This novel couldn't seem to decide if it was romance, chick lit, or just plain fiction. <br /> <br/>For a novel that was supposed to be scandalous and dishy, it lacked that certain naughtiness that one would normally expect. Sure, there were plenty of affairs and bad language; there were plenty of curse words and crudeness thrown in for good measure. But somehow, Siena never came across as someone that I could root for. The author may have been trying to play up the \\"poor little right girl\\" thing, but I wasn't convinced. <br /> <br />Also, there was a very bad twist to the story that got thrown in towards the end. I won't give it away, but it was cringe worthy and honestly did nothing to make me sympathize with Siena, although that certainly was the intent. <br /> <br />Overall, however, this was a decently good novel, and I'm sure many people will enjoy making their way through the 500+ pages. I'm planning to check out Tilly Bagshawe's next novel, for there is certainly promise in her writing.	2005-08-12

Or maybe not all Americans, but it's clear that many chick lit novelists are! Laurie Gwen Shapiro's latest offering The Anglophile in fact features a woman who absolutely loves anything to do with the British - especially the men. <br /> <br />Shari Diamond, a linguist working on her Ph.D, is the Anglophile in question. She has been obsessed with nearly anything British since early childhood. Since she can't exactly go and live in England, she contents herself with dating British men who live in the U.S. <br /> <br />During a business trip to Chicago, she meets an extraordinarily handsome and accomplished British man named Kit who is visiting the states. They end up hitting it off rather well. As a matter of fact, he turns out to be a Linguist also.. and professional competition. But they get along so well that he offers her a trip to England. How could Shari turn that down? <br /> <br />Throw in a dead skunk, very strange family members, an old childhood school friend (who is rather cute himself), an ever-growing suspicion about Kit, and soon Shari doesn't know what to do. Will she end up having to choose between her dissertation and a man? Or two men? <br /> <br />The Anglophile was an interesting read, especially for someone like myself that also loves anything British (including the men). The author has definitely done her homework with the subject of the Brits and their history. It was a refreshing change for the main character to have a slightly unusual profession as a linguist. <br /> <br />The only downfall to this story was that the plot seemed to go all over the place at times. I couldn't figure out why the side stories of the dead skunk was in there, among other things. The romance subplot of the story was very predictable as well - due in part to the back cover copy. <br /> <br />Overall, however, this was an unusually smart and offbeat chick lit story that I recommend. If you like the British, you will like thisbook.	2005-08-12

A world where the skinnier you are, the more you are ridiculed? That is the concept of what \\"Alternate Beauty\\" by Andrea Rains Waggener is. <br /> <br />Meet Tabitha. She is overweight and generally unhappy. She is tired of being constantly put down by her mother, a thin socialite. The woman she rents an apartment from is not the nicest person around either. Worst of all, she's about to lose her job because she is getting too heavy, and as her boss says, she isn't projecting the right image for the store. Problem is, she works in a large woman's store! Her sort-of boyfriend Gordon is OK, but rather bland. <br /> <br />Just when she thinks she can't take anymore, she wakes up the next morning... and suddenly lives in a world where \\"overweight\\" is considered \\"gorgeous\\". To the point where the skinny are discriminated against rather strongly. Tabitha catches on quickly to what is going on, and she wonders how she landed in this alternate universe. Suddenly she is model-beautiful to everyone else. Her mother adores her and everything seems perfect. After the shock wears off, she settles into her new exciting life. <br /> <br />That is, until she finds she can't keep weight on her. Being so happy and all, she no longer has an appetite. And she finds herself in the terrible position of losing it all... literally. <br /> <br />For the most part, I enjoyed this book. It has an original story line and most of the loose ends were tied up neatly by the end. Tabitha was a great main heroine that many could identify with. This book also really makes you think about society and the way people are treated based on their looks. <br /> <br />The only downside to this story was that it wasn't quite as exciting or absorbing as I'd hoped. I kept reading to find out what would happen, but the story just didn't grab me the way I'd hoped. The plot is also a lot to wrap your mind around, but I pretty much expected that when I picked it up to read. <br /> <br />Overall however, I would still recommend this as an interesting fantasy type chick lit novel, and to anyone who likes reading about a heroine struggling with weight issues.	2005-08-07

This latest debut novel by Jennifer van der Kwast features Sarah, a young woman who has been unemployed for over six months. Luckily she is scraping by with the odd freelance under-the-table manuscript-reading job (for her previous boss who had laid her off) and a string of unfortunate temp positions. However, at one such position she meets Jake - a gorgeous guy who had recently dumped his girlfriend after catching her cheating. <br /> <br />Sarah and Jake really hit it off and are very attracted to each other and share the same passion for movies, but Sara can't help but wonder if Jake is merely on the rebound. After all, the break-up with his stunning ex girlfriend seems to have devastated him. <br /> <br />Through temp jobs from hell, ex bosses with a score to settle and relationship woes, Pounding the Pavement was a great summer read. Anyone who has ever been unemployed and not willing to settle for a job that will clearly bore them to tears will be able to identify with this novel. The author did a great job of presenting the heroine in such a way that many will empathize with her situation. <br /> <br />This book had a little bit of everything: romance, job angst, roommate hell, friendship and fun. There was an interesting and unusual factor to this novel: the author sometimes let the reader imagine what would happen next, instead of telling what acutally did happen next. There were several scenes that should/could have ended with details, but instead the author just kind of let it hang as though we were supposed to fill in the blanks. I didn't mind it much, although I would have enjoyed it had it been done less often. The ending was left completely to the readers' imaginations as well. <br /> <br />Other than that and the constant (and sometimes annoying) movie references, I loved this novel and recommend it to anyone who loves a great book about trying to find that perfect job and man in the big city.	2005-08-01

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to bartend in New York City or the Hamptons? I know I have! The Perfect Manhattan will take you behind the bartending scenes and show you both the good and bad. <br /> <br />Meet Cassie, a fresh graduate from Columbia University who wants to be a writer but knows she needs to support herself in the meantime. No corporate slave-driven job for her! Instead she decides to become a bartender, telling herself it will only be temporary. After long hours of schmoozing customers and her boss, she ends up with a great opportunity to work in a bar in the Hamptons for the summer. <br /> <br />So after snagging a decidedly questionable summer share (a house occupied by a bunch of drunken frat-boy types), Cassie and her good friend Annie (a cocktail waitress) begin work at what turns out to be the hottest bar/club in the Hamptons. <br /> <br />Too bad Cassie exaggerated her bartending skills in the interview... will she get in over her head? What about the deliciously handsome and famous bachelor James? He really seems to be interested in her, but why does he keep introducing her to his socialite Paris Hilton look-alike crowd as his friend only (and not his girlfriend)? <br /> <br />I enjoyed The Perfect Manhattan quite a bit, to the point of not being able to put it down once I started. Told in first-person narrative, this book is packed with delectable details and exciting adventures. From dates with famous bachelors to snobby socialites to the stuck-up social ladder of the Hamptons to the interesting life of a bartender, this book has it all, and then some. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the theme of the book: a young woman, fresh out of college, decides not to pursue the traditional way of life, and instead goes on to struggle to support herself and follow her dream. Along the way she runs into plenty of bumps but retains her sense of humor. Cassie is a great main character, if a little naive. <br /> <br />The only downsides tothis novel were that some of the happenings were a bit unrealistic, and there was at least a couple of scenes in the novel that were of the eye-rolling variety. For instance, how does she suddenly get a screenplay written when she is so busy bartending? Other than a couple of small things however, The Perfect Manhattan was a great read. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for an awesome summer read - don't miss this one!	2005-08-01

I absolutely love chick lit that feature Indian characters, so I was glad when I learned Sonia Singh had a second novel out entitled \\"Bollywood Confidential\\". Although her first novel was average at best in my opinion, this latest book was a great read. <br /> <br />Raveena is a struggling Indian actress currently living in Los Angeles. She is tired of not getting anywhere in her acting career. After much deliberation, she decides to accept her agent's latest offer: the lead in a Bollywood film - that takes place and shoots in Bombay, India. Despite her misgivings about living in another country for six months, she figures it would be worth it; after all, she is playing the leading role! <br /> <br />Despite the fact that she is of Indian decent, Raveena has grown up in the USA and is unprepared for how India really is: extremely dirty, crowded and hot. Her hotel is a dump, and she is forced to move in temporarily with her seemingly crazy uncle. The director is lecherous and determined to get her into bed, and her costar, the extremely handsome and famous Indian movie star Siddharth, is charismatic and famous, but aloof and uninterested. Too bad Raveena is attracted to him. <br /> <br />Worst of all, the as-of-yet unwritten script turns out to be downright terrible. Raveena is afraid she has made a big mistake by accepting this offer to star in what will obviously be a flop of a movie. But she is determined to stick it out. <br /> <br />If the Indian food and water doesn't kill her first... <br /> <br />Just when it seems Raveena might have caught Siddharth's attention, she gets embroiled in a love triangle with India's number one actress, who is also interested in Siddharth. <br /> <br />Bollywood Confidential was a tantalizingly delicious read. Filled with glitz, glamour, poverty, backstabbing, and rivalry - I was hooked from the start. Raveena is a smart, admirable main heroine that I liked reading about. Sonia Singh has a fluid, engaging writing style that mademe want to continue reading until the end. <br /> <br />The only downfall to this book was that it was a bit predictable overall. Also, the last couple of chapters were downright ridiculous and far-fetched, for the most part. <br /> <br />But overall, the great writing and engaging story line made up for any bad parts. I highly recommend this book to all who want to enjoy a great story about actresses and India.	2005-07-29

She has a wonderful way of creating vivid, endearing characters that get into all sorts of mishaps. Her latest offering, \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\", however, sort of disappointed me. <br /> <br />Meet Samantha Sweeting. A highly intelligent and workaholic attorney for a prestigious law firm, she is over-stressed and high-strung. Even during a spa treatment for her 29th birthday, she can't bear to tear herself away from her blackberry or cell phone. About to be made partner at the firm, she is known for her competence and brains. <br /> <br />However, on the day she is supposed to have her partnership announced, she discovers she has made a huge error costing one of the firm's clients over 50 million pounds. And she completely loses it. She stumbles out of the office, onto the nearest train, and manages to somehow get mistaken for a housekeeper seeking a job. And... she ends up getting a housekeeper job at the Geiger residence. <br /> <br />The only problem is, Samantha doesn't even know how to turn on an iron, let alone wash clothes, cook fancy dinners, or sew. Although she \\"accidentally\\" mentions to the Geigers that she is highly skilled in those areas. (Shades of Becky Bloomwood, indeed!) <br /> <br />This book started off really good. I liked that the main character was very intelligent and had an interesting career at a law firm. The book has Kinsella's trademark wit, humor and lively storytelling. As always, the other characters were endearing and interesting. I did have a hard time putting this novel down for the first several chapters. <br /> <br />But unfortunately, things went sort of downhill. For one thing, everything just happens WAY too conveniently and coincidentally for Samantha. As a matter of fact, most of the novel is based on things that just \\"happened\\" somehow. The entire novel is too far-fetched. Samantha somehow goes from not knowing how to even use an iron to someone cooking, cleaning and mending happily within 3 short weeks, among other things. It's ridiculous. I feel that Kinsella should have spent more time fleshing the plot out more realistically. One should not have to suspend THAT much disbelief in a fiction novel! <br /> <br />And the ending? Perhaps had this been a fairy tale, it would have had the perfect ending. For a chick lit novel, it was just too trite and hackneyed. Without giving away the ending, I can't go into further details, but I was disappointed about the choices Samantha made. And the events leading up to the ending were just ludicrous of the eye-rolling variety. <br /> <br />Kinsella's breezy and enjoyable writing style saved this book from being a total disaster, but overall it was nothing more than an average read - much less than what I've come to expect from this author. I do however recommend this book to chick lit/fiction fans alike for a light, humorous, romantic summer novel - if they are willing to deal with such an unbelievable plot.	2005-07-22

(Katie Chandler, Book 1)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Amazingly Excellent Debut Chick Lit Fantasy Novel	Although not a Harry Potter fan in the least, so far I have absolutely loved the novels to come out of the chick lit paranormal/fantasy sub-genre. Enchanted, Inc by Shanna Swendson was so good, in fact, that it made me wish the genre was bigger. <br /> <br />Meet Katie Chandler. From a small town in Texas and now residing in the large and overwhelming New York City, Katie is just trying to fit in and find her niche. Unfortunately her meager salary as an Assistant to the Marketing Director is barely covering rent, let alone any extras, and her boss is just plain terrible to work for. Katie also begins noticing more abnormal things on the streets and subways she takes to and from work. For instance, what is up with the girl with fairy wings? And why does nobody else seem to notice the gargoyle that sits on top of the church? And who is the horrifically ugly man who has begun to follow her around and offer her a new job? <br /> <br />After a particularly horrible day at her current job, Katie decides to bite the bullet and go for an interview at the company, MSI Inc, that the strange man keeps emailing her about. <br /> <br />Katie is in for a surprise, one that involves a lucrative new job, magic, spells, magic immunity, handsome men, gargoyles, fairies, and much more. <br /> <br />I absolutely loved Enchanted, Inc. It was a classic single-girl-in-the-city formula with a nice fantasy twist thrown in. Katie, for instance, has to deal with her job, boss, men, and life in the big city at the same time as handling her \\"immunity to magic\\" situation, which ends up taking more of her time than she ever intended. Through it all, Katie never loses her intelligence or humor. <br /> <br />Once you wrap your mind around the story line, this book manages to be somewhat realistic despite its magical plot... and for me, that is a major plus in any novel I'm reading! <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend this book to all chick lit and fantasy fans for a fresh new entry into the newfantasy/paranormal chick lit genre. People who enjoy books set in New York City will also love it!	2005-07-18

Or... are you a type of person that would never be labeled as \\"nice\\" in a million years? Even if you are neither of these, you will most likely enjoy Alesia Holliday's latest novel \\"Nice Girls Finish First\\".  <br /> <br />This book is told from two points of view. Firstly, there is Kirby, VP of marketing for a sex toy manufacturer. She is a type of woman that has never been mistaken for being nice. As a matter of fact, after recently firing most of her department, her boss Banning Stuart has issued an ultimatum: Kirby either gets someone to declare that she is nice, or she will not be able to go on the Italian vacation she has planned. Not only that, but she will lose her job. Kirby steps up to the challenge, albeit a bit reluctantly. After all, you don't get ahead in life by being nice, right?  <br /> <br />Then there is Brianna, Kirby's assistant. She is Kirby's opposite: just too nice for her own good. She is currently engaged to a sweet guy named Lyle, and trying to make it as an Opera singer. Putting up with Kirby's terrible handwriting and tempers isn't easy, but she is determined to do her job well. When Brianna finds about Kirby's challenge, she decides to help her out.  <br /> <br />With the quirky characters and sometimes laugh-out-loud madcap moments that Holliday is known for, Nice Girls Finish First is a completely enjoyable read. It's intriguing to be able to see both sides of the coin: a girl who is too nice and a girl who is too mean. There is also a romantic side plot to both girls' stories that I loved.  <br /> <br />The plot was a tiny bit far-fetched - after all, an office bet that hinges on a person being called nice doesn't happen much in real life, but Alesia Holliday does a wonderful job of keeping it realistic despite the circumstances. I really couldn't find anything about this novel I didn't enjoy.  <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel for some good, solid, romantic summer reading. Fans ofthis author's other book will also enjoy this novel, although it's not quite as zany or hilarious. I'm looking forward to seeing what this author comes up with next!	2005-07-05

Meet Scarlett Stein, the heroine of Lauren Baratz-Logsted's latest novel. She is beautiful and never lacks for meeting men, but she is nearing 40 and still unmarried. Her love of books makes her job as a librarian the perfect career, but there definite downfalls. After catching a nasty case of Chicken pox, Scarlett is confined to her home. At the same time, her jealous friend Pam keeps telling her that she should frumpify herself in order to find the perfect man - so that he will see her personality rather than her looks.  <br /> <br />Since Scarlett is still single, she decides maybe Pam has a point. After some pointless arguing, the gorgeous Scarlet Stein becomes the frumpy, unkempt Lettie Shaw. She quits her job at the Danbury Library and goes to a smaller town to start over.  <br /> <br />And somehow, despite her frumpiness, she still manages to meet men.  <br /> <br />\\"A Little Change of Face\\" was definitely a strange book.  Firstly, there are wacky characters that you will find nowhere else: Pam, the jealous, spiteful friend; TB, whose initials stand for something I will leave the reader to discover; Delta, single mother of two frightful children, and Scarlett herself, who is quite amusing and seemingly strong-willed.  <br /> <br />As with the previous novels by Baratz-Logsted, the plot in this book is a bit far-fetched. That is, when the plot is actualy happening! It's razor-sharp commentary and observations that makes the novel so interesting. Scarlett will amuse you for hours with her odd but entertaining thoughts on life, friendship, men, and work.  <br /> <br />The things in this book that I didn't like were the far-fetched plot that went almost nowhere, and the fact that none of the characters (except for TB and Scarlett herself most of the time) were very easy to like.  <br /> <br />However, the novel's quirkiness more than made up for it and enabled me to finish the book with a smile on my face.  <br /> <br />Overall, for an out-of-the-ordinary and thought-provoking read, I would definitely recommend this book.  <br />	2005-06-28

There is nothing like a breathtakingly good book that simply will not let you put it down, regardless of what time you have to get up the next morning.  Even better is when it is a debut novel.  I found \\"Twins of Tribeca\\" by Rachel Pine to be such a novel.  It was so good, so gossipy, so dishy, and so well-written that I simply had no choice but to finish the book in one read. <br /> <br />Bored with her job at CNN, Karen Jacobs (our main heroine) jumps at the chance to work in the publicity department for Glorious Productions. Despite having heard terrible rumors about the working conditions there, she manages to get hired on as a junior publicist - assistant to the infamous Allegra Orecchi.   <br /> <br />Karen realizes pretty quickly that she may be in over her head.  The elusive Allegra is rarely around, and when she is, she isn't the most pleasant person to deal with.  Dagney, Allegra's other assistant, seems OK at first, but soon starts acting like she is jealous of Karen and is about to have a nervous breakdown.  Then there is the whole backstabbing issue:  it seems all the top people in the department hate each other and will stop at nothing to tear one another down.  Karen realizes that she is in the middle of it all - which is not a good place to be.   <br /> <br />While in the midst of juggling her 12-hour work days, Karen has to try not to get too cozy with a Page Six editor who could send all of her hard work tumbling down around her.   <br /> <br />This book was an enormously interesting read.  Filled with studio moguls, harried assistants, glitz, glamour, and backstabbing, I couldn't have asked for a better novel.  It was a well-written, highly engaging story with a great main heroine and plenty of other intriguing characters.  The book's setting goes from the Tribeca area in Manhattan to the red carpet and movie premieres in Hollywood- all without losing pace.  There are also a lot of interesting details about the ins and outs of movie studios, publicity, and much more. <br /> <br />There is very little about Karen's personal life thrown into the story, as it is mostly centered around her job.  But the author does a great job of tying everything up neatly at the end - with no lagging parts or stalling chapters, as other books of this nature have had.  Best of all, the novel stays realistic throughout it all, regardless of the sometimes implausible situations. <br /> <br />Overall I highly, highly recommend this awesome debut to anyone who likes a great novel - chick lit or otherwise!  Fans of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" will adore this book and also find a special treat within the pages.	2005-06-15

There is a fine line between Chick Lit and Romance, and a lot of authors toe the line delicately.  I would definitely say that although \\"A Connecticut Fashionista in King Authur's Court\\" by Marianne Mancusi is supposed to be Chick Lit, it fits more comfortably (in my opinion) into the Romance category.    Katherine (Kat) Jones is the heroine of this novel.  She is a bright, outspoken woman in her late twenties trying to get the latest scoop for her fashion columnist job, which just happened to be about Medieval garb.  Traipsing around at the local King Authur Faire  isn't helping her disposition much, and when she agrees to get a palm reading by a gnarled gypsy woman, she scoffs so much that the gypsy threatens to put a curse on her.  (A curse to send her into another \\"time\\").  Kat waves her off in what I soon learned to be her trademark airy, carefree way.     But after getting hit over the head with a flying lance a little while later, she awakes and finds herself in a strange place filled with strange people.  After much confusion, a couple of horseback rides (one with the famous Lancelot), and a conversation with Queen Guenevere, she realizes the gypsy woman had made good on her promise: Kat has somehow ended up in Camelot... back in King Authur's day.  And with the handsome Lancelot always trying to rescue her, she might soon find herself in over her head.    This book was an extremely light read filled with hilarious dialogue, romance, and fashion.  Kat is a tough, sometimes brash, but often spunky heroine that I liked.  Being a modern girl used to the 21st century's amenities, comfort and fashion, she handles things with aplomb.  She was a character that I wouldn't mind reading another book about.    My main disappointment with this book was that I had been expecting a chick lit novel, with more of a developed and fleshed out story line, characters and resolution.  Instead it turned out to be a mostly contemporary (time-travel) romance, complete with bodice-ripping type love scenes and a love-centered story.  But the extremely far-fetched plot held together well for the most part of the novel and had an unexpected (and funny) ending.    This was a very light read - if you are looking for substance, you will not find much of it here.  But if you are looking for a madcap, hilarious contemporary time-travel romance, you will love this book.  I enjoyed it and recommend it especially to King Authur fans, as it also gives a new interesting twist to some of the old legends.	2005-06-08

These novels usually feature women struggling to find their right career path, and in the process, go over a lot of bumps or end up having to claw their way up the ladder of success. This book is a wonderful example of such a novel.<br /><br />Heather Hall, the main character, is what you would call a \\"corporate rebel\\". She has been working for a large corporation called Commerce World, and along with her friend Regan, is testing just how far she could go without getting \\"laid off\\" or fired. Since the company had been doing layoffs for some time, she fears her turn is coming up soon. Sneaking away on two hour lunches, watching movies during company time, and coming in late every day, Heather knows her number will be up soon. And sure enough, it is one day.<br /><br />Knowing she's burned some bridges, Heather tries to find another job she is happy in and can make a decent salary at. It's not easy - the economy is terrible and she has a family at home that she must juggle along with her job. After flitting to a couple of other companies and not finding a job that is a good fit, Heather finally realizes where her true talents lie, and sets out to find true job satisfaction.<br /><br />In this novel, Stephanie Bavaro has done an awesome job of chronicling the struggles of today's woman finding a job, keeping it, and attaining true job satisfaction. In this book you will find hilarious descriptions, interesting and witty dialogue and a down-to-earth and intelligent main character. Chalking It Up is the perfect chick lit read.<br /><br />Be prepared to laugh when you sit down to read this novel - I cracked up with laughter more than once at the way Commerce World and some of its other employees was described, and some of the shenanigans that Heather and Regan got up to. I also loved the way their friendship was portrayed.<br /><br />Bavaro's writing style is highly satisfying. She is one new author to keep an eye on - \\"Chalking It Up\\" is her debut novel and I certainly hope she plans to write more.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a stellar read. It's a hilarious, addictive, dead-on account of one woman's search for job satisfaction in today's less-than perfect economy that you don't want to miss.	2005-06-08

She is a church-going girl with morals, and she vows not to drink to much or get involved with the wrong man. Thanks to her generous uncle, she has a new job at a large publishing house. Emily knows immediately that things aren't going to be quite as she'd imagined. First, her roommate (whom she'd met on the internet) was nothing like she'd hoped. Then she meets the totally eligible and handsome Bennett. He seems to be the last man in Manhattan that goes to church and has morals. They immediately hit it off, but it becomes clear that something isn't quite right. He seems to keep trying to get her into bed, for one thing, although she's made it clear that she doesn't do that before marriage.  <br /> <br />Emily flounders around the city for a bit, doing things she vowed never to do, such as going out and getting drunk with the girls from the office. When the time comes for her morals and beliefs to be tested, she realizes she must speak up, even if it means losing her job...  <br /> <br />I enjoyed Emily Ever After for the most part. Emily was a good character - flawed yet easy to like. Reading about her new job and life in the city was fun, and I liked how she seemed to have morals. This book kind of straddles the line between Christian Chick Lit and regular Chick Lit, and leans more heavily towards the latter. Therefore, it should appeal to a wide variety of readers.  <br /> <br />There were a few bothersome things about this book. People who pick up this book thinking it will be Christian Chick lit might be disappointed since the main character drinks a lot and doesn't really live the life of a dedicated Christian. There is very little mention of the actual Christian faith, yet the character tries to act as though she is a devout Christian. Also, Emily is a bit naiv about a lot ofthings - to the point of it being annoying. How can she not know that Bennett is up to no good? It is so obvious to the reader. Lastly, a few of the \\"plot twists\\" end a little too conveniently.  <br /> <br />Overall however, I found \\"Emily Ever After\\" to be a great read about one woman's struggle to find herself in the big city. I definitely recommend it to all chick lit fans - especially ones that enjoy New York city chick lit.	2005-06-07

Nearly everyone has something to say.  \\"I'm Not the New Me\\" by Wendy McClure is a memoir based on the online journal she kept to (sort-of) track her weight loss.  This book chronicles how Wendy lost over 25 pounds mostly using the Weight Watchers system.  She makes clear that she was adamantly against all the diet type things and advice that everyone always gave her.  Through the course of the story, we learn how Wendy came about to deciding to lose weight and putting her website online; how she had a couple of serious relationships that fell apart; how she learned through friends that she wasn't truly \\"ready\\" to lose all of her weight.  And much more. <br /> <br />Laid out in short chapters that occasionally go from present to past tense, there are even some funny weight-watcher cards in the middle of the book that make fun of the horrible diet \\"dishes\\" that are supposed to be healthy.   <br /> <br />For the most part this was a semi-enjoyable read.  I didn't laugh hysterically at anything in the novel as some other readers did; for some reason, a lot of the supposed humor fell flat.  But the book had its funny moments.  Wendy is an unusual character, and this book is well-written.  <br /> <br />The main thing about this novel that I came away with, however, was that the main character seems to almost not have a likeable personality.  I mean, she has a very dry sense of humor, but sometimes things she said that were supposed to be funny just weren't.  She comes off at times as though she is very bitter.  There was one very disturbing chapter in the novel where Wendy gets upset that someone tells her she looks much nicer since she'd lost some weight.  She ends up telling the person angrily that she lost it due to cancer.  I think that was supposed to be funny (since she didn't have cancer), but I just didn't find it amusing in the least.  As a matter of fact, I found it to be in very poor taste. <br /> <br />It is definitely possible that I just didn't \\"get\\" the humor in this book, or the meaning of it either.  Although I tried. <br /> <br />Overall, however, this is an interesting and amusing read that I recommend to anyone who has ever had to struggle with their weight.	2005-06-06

Chick lit meets danger/suspense/action in this novel- or at least I thought it was supposed to.  Let me elucidate.    Meet Melanie Prescott.  The first time we meet her, she is a hip, upbeat woman just scraping by on rent, hoping to meet Mr. Right and trying to fund her expensive taste for designer shoes. The day starts off normally: she is walking dogs for some extra cash when she runs into her ex boyfriend Todd, who manages to coerce her (with beautiful designer shoes) into coming over to his place for dinner.  But after a night spent with him, she wakes and discovers him in a pool of blood and brains... and the hunt begins.    Melanie doesn't know it yet, but she has been chosen to participate in a game (called PSW) that originally started on the Internet.  Somehow it has morphed into real life.  Melanie is an unwilling target, and with the help of the gorgeous (and brawny) Stryker, who is assigned as her protector, she must solve clue after clue to stay alive.  With her uncanny knack at solving puzzles and juggling numbers, she is definitely a good match for the puzzles, while Stryker is just plain a good match...for her.    First off, I must admit that this book was well-written.  Melanie was an interesting main character, as she was smart and tough.  The book had an engaging writing style, plenty of chick lit elements and non-stop action.  It was fun to try and figure out the clues with the characters.  I plan to read another novel by this author.    However, being that this was supposed to be a mystery/suspense... well, it just didn't work.  To begin with, the entire story line was extremely far-fetched.  When I got the gist of it, I continued reading, thinking somehow things would be more explained and fleshed out later on.   But they weren't.  One will never know the details of how this game went from the Internet into real life, and many other elements I felt were significant to the plot.      Not only that, but there was absolutely no suspense in this book.  The characters had such an easy time of things while they were supposedly running for their lives, and it just didn't ring true.  Things were just TOO convenient.  [...] The whole thing was way too predictable and bland for my tastes.  The romance subplot, while entertaining, was extremely predictable as well.    Overall, I'd recommend this for an extremely light, cookie-cutter chick-lit style romance/action novel.  For mystery, suspense or an intricate (and believable) plot, I'd definitely look elsewhere.	2005-06-01

She has a tiny but tastefully decorated apartment, and a tough, demanding but well-paying job as a business manager, complete with hellish hours and rude boss. Audrey is generally happy, but discontent at her corporate life gnaws at her from time to time. One night, at a company dinner party she is hosting, Audrey discovers that her coworkers think she is cold and kind of mean. Audrey gets pretty upset, knowing this isn't the life for her. What has she become? And what can she do? Then a phone call from her sister Ava back home in Florida comes through - it turns out their father is very ill, and Audrey needs to fly home immediately.  <br /> <br />Audrey puts her New York life on hold and flies home. She is immediately absorbed into her sister's wonderful family and the sadness of her father's condition. Audrey soon discovers that maybe she shouldn't have left so many things behind... Such as her loving sister, her ex-boyfriend (an old flame that is still burning), and her father, who doesn't seem to have long. She also finds that she has been missing the peace of mind she gets in the beautiful, quiet place she grew up in. And when eventually she is faced with a difficult choice, she has to decide what she truly wants... either to continue clawing her way up the corporate ladder (complete with the high salary and status it comes with), or the love of her life and the simplicity she has so long craved.  <br /> <br />Her Backyard was a great read. It was absorbing, touching at times, funny and sometimes uplifting, and just plain a darn good read. Audrey was a wonderful main heroine - she had flaws that many will be able to identify with, but at the same timehad a definite strength.  <br /> <br />Her Backyard has all the ingredients of an outstanding chick lit book: a character going through job angst, uncertainty in life, romance, and family issues. The only downside to this book was that it seemed to be drawn out longer than it needed to be.  <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this book. It left me with a smile on my face, and I don't doubt it will do the same to others!	2005-06-01

Lee Nichols, author of \\"Hand Me Down\\" definitely possesses such talent - her characters in both of her books have been flawed, but highly lovable.    In this latest offering, we have Annie (Anne).  She is tired of living in the shadow of her two older sisters- one is a famous swimsuit model and the other is a bestselling author.  Not only that but her life growing up as the youngest child has always been difficult.  She often ended up with the oldest and most worn items.    As a result, Annie doesn't like anything old or used, and has a very hard time committing.  Now 29 years old, she is vaguely happy with her boyfriend Rip, a decent job (working as an Office Manager for Rip), and gets to spend time with her sisters and their children.  However, she isn't quite satisfied with her life.  Especially when Ian, her childhood crush (and older sister's ex-boyfriend) keeps showing up.  It soon becomes clear that Annie isn't over her \\"crush\\" on Ian.  But she refuses to settle with one of her sisters' ex-boyfriends.  Plus, he isn't interested in her anyway... he has a fiance, right?    \\"Hand-Me-Down\\" was a often hilarious and enjoyable read.  Lee Nichols manages to really get us in the head of the main character.  Although the plot seems at a sort of stand-still through a lot of the book, it is still fun to read because of the funny and endearing scrapes/situations that Annie gets herself into.  She is definitely one of those characters that \\"make\\" the book.      As with this author's last book, the reading was fresh, fun and kept me turning pages.  Without giving any spoilers, however, the only thing I was a little disappointed about with this book was the romance aspect, which was a bit on the bland side.      Overall however, I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a wonderful, hilarious and cute novel with great characters.  I'm eager to see what this author comes up with next!	2005-05-30

With three previous regular chick lit novels under her belt, Laura Caldwell's latest book \\"Look Closely\\" is a suspense/mystery chick lit novel - one that I found hard to put down. <br /> <br />It all begins when New York City Attorney Hailey Sutter receives an anonymous letter one day that simply reads: \\"There is no statute of limitations on murder.  Look closely\\".  Immediately Hailey knows that the note has something to do with her mother's death, which happened over twenty years ago but has always been shrouded in mystery and silence.  As a matter of fact, she has been estranged from her sister and brother her entire adult life, and her father, who practices for the same law firm as Hailey, always closes up whenever the subject is brought up. <br /> <br />Hailey decides to once and for all solve the mystery of what really happened to her mother.  The only problem is, she has no memory of the night, although she was supposedly present.  And nobody's talking.  So she hops on a plane and returns to the small coastal town she lived in, and begins digging deeper.  The timing is bad unfortunately since she is embroiled in a tough case with a difficult client and trying to make partner in the law firm, but she manages to juggle her travel plans accordingly.  And slowly, she begins uncovering details she had previously known little (if anything) about.  She also suddenly starts having flashbacks of the night her mother died.   <br /> <br />Soon, it's as though everyone could be a suspect or is hiding something: her father, who is definitely holding out on some important information and who wants Hailey to stop the investigation; the sweet, handsome Tyler who runs a hotel in the town Hailey once lived in that is inexplicably nice and helpful (and whose father had originally been assigned the details of her mother's death); her brother and sister, who she manages to track down just in time for them to suddenly and mysteriously disappear; and others.  Hailey knows she is indanger and is certain that nobody wants her to know the truth.  But why? <br /> <br />I loved this book!  \\"Look Closely\\" was a page-turner of a novel that I got into immediately.  Caldwell has a way of drawing the reader in within the first chapter, and this book is no exception.  This book has tons of suspense, mystery, a dash of subtle romance, and some of the usual chick lit elements.  I was also pleasantly and completely shocked at the ending.   <br /> <br />There did seem to be a couple of tiny loose plot threads that didn't seem to get resolved in the end, but they were small enough to have not taken anything away from this wonderful novel. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to all suspense fans, and to anyone who enjoys a smart, exciting chick lit mystery.	2005-05-29

We've all dated him, and some of us are too good at finding him.  Emily Sanders, our main heroine of this novel, seems to have an extraordinarily good nose at picking out the wrong man.  So she decides to go to therapy to see what she is doing wrong.  Her therapist tells her to make a list of 10 reasons why she thinks it didn't work out for her past relationships.  So she does. <br /> <br />The novel goes back and forth in time, and tells the story of each of Emily's relationships, while Emily lists the reasons why she thinks it didn't work out.  Each of the stories are really good.  When she gets to her most recent relationship, which she is still in at the time of therapy, she begins listing why she knows deep down that the relationship won't work out either. <br /> <br />This was a great book.  I personally feel as though I've learned some things about dating Mr. Wrong, which was an added benefit of reading this novel.  Through all her bad choices with men, Emily doesn't seem to me to be a pushover or idiot; instead she seems intelligent and funny, but just needs some guidance in her love life.  Another great thing about this novel was that although it went back and forth from past to present, it didn't once get confusing. <br /> <br />The only thing about this book that I didn't like as much was that the writing seemed awkward and did not flow smoothly.  I ran across a couple of grammatically incorrect sentences that made me raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br />However, overall this was a great book that I really enjoyed.  Best of all, I feel I came away with some good pointers about how to spot Mr. Wrong.  This book definitely isn't for everyone - if you don't like stories about a woman sitting in therapy and rehashing the past mistakes she's made with men, then you most likely won't like this book.

I love reading books about traveling and dating - especially when based on a true story.  I knew this book fit into both categories and was based on the author's non-fictional account of how she found her true love. <br /> <br />\\"Around the World in 80 Dates\\" starts off in the UK where Jennifer is fresh from her latest heartbreak, and takes the reader from beginning to end.  You will learn how she conceived of her \\"Around the World in 80 Dates\\" idea;  You will be taken vicariously through each of her sometimes odd but often interesting dates; You'll see how she ends up meeting \\"the one\\"; and much more. <br /> <br />There were definitely some dates that stood out in the book: the handsome, overly confident Frank in Holland; William from Sweden who ended up expecting something from the date that Jennifer wasn't prepared to give him; the good-looking and enigmatic Olivier from France who didn't give Jennifer something she wanted; Davide, who was already happily devoted to a dead woman; Garry from Seattle who she meets at the Burning Man Festival in the hot deserts of Nevada; and many more.  Through it all Jennifer has to juggle jet lag, constant travel, coordinating future dates, and keeping in touch with the friends and family who want to know what is going on. <br /> <br />\\"Around the World in 80 Dates\\" was an engaging and fast-moving read  that I really enjoyed up until the part where Jennifer seems to find her true love.  From there, the story line went sort of downhill. Although she remains determined to carry out her \\"80 dates\\" plan, she isn't as enthusiastic, and all she can think about is the man she's fallen in love with.  (Not that I could blame her!)  But the last fourth of the book was very slow-going and I had to force myself to finish it. <br /> <br />The best thing about this book is getting to go along with Jennifer on her many dates in all kinds of exotic places - from Los Angeles to Sweden to Asia - and many places in between. <br /> <br />Overall, Iwould recommend this novel to travel and chick lit fans, and anyone who is curious what it is like going on a bunch of first dates.  I certainly hope there is more non-fiction chick lit to come from Downtown Press!	2005-05-21

We first saw this type of book in \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" (which was a better book than this). With \\"Wolves in Chic Clothing\\" by Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman, it's a jewelry heiress named Lell Pelham of Pelham Jewelers who decides to take the hip, beautiful but offbeat Julia under her wings. <br /> <br />It begins innocently enough. First Julia gets to deliver Lell's engagement ring to her, then Lell decides to promote Julia to be her assistant in a new department of the store. Soon Julia is thrust into parties, makeovers, and society events. Lell's rich and mostly stuck-up friends, who are not without problems of their own, also take Julia under her wing, but not without some cattiness. But when Lell's husband and Julia realize they are extremely attracted to each other, things begin spinning out of control. What will happen if Lell catches them? <br /> <br />This book had all the makings of a good novel, but unfortunately it just didn't come together as an intriguing and solid read. Although it was fun to read about heiresses and the super-rich doing all the things they do, the story lacked any type of substance and crucial plot elements.  The authors also refer to themselves at one point in the book (although they hide their names) which I thought was ridiculous.  The characters were wooden and very unrealistic.  I know this was supposed to be a light, gossipy read, but this just went way overboard and frankly, insulted the reader's intelligence.  If I had to sum up this book in one word, unfortunately it would be \\"boring\\".   <br /> <br />The things I did enjoy in the book was reading about the situations and problems that Lell's circle of friends were going through. They were interesting and made an otherwise awful book a little more readable. <br /> <br />Overall I don't recommend wasting your money on this book until it's published in soft cover. So much more could have done with the plot and characters, and wasn't.   <br /> <br />Please note: this is a reposting of an earlier review.  I have read this book for a second time and felt a need to revise the original review.	2005-05-16

I have to admit that the novels in the Shopaholic series are some of my absolute favorite chick lit books around.  So, be aware that this review is based on the UK version of this book, since I couldn't wait for it to be released in the USA and had bought it the moment it became available in the UK. <br /> <br />So here we are at book four. Becky is now happily married to Luke, is traveling around the world with him on an extended honeymoon, and still has a desire for shopping. However, after about nine months of schlepping around the world, they decide to return to reality. Overnight Luke turns from the hippie-like nomad he'd been on the honeymoon into his old business-like self again. Becky meanwhile can't wait to get home and surprise everyone and share stories about their world travel. <br /> <br />Upon Becky and Luke's return to London, however, she discovers things aren't quite the way she expected. Her good friend Suze has a new best friend named Lulu, who doesn't seem to enjoy Becky's company much. Luke has discovered the extent of Becky's shopping to such a degree that he's put her on a budget. Worst of all, Becky's parents drop a bomb - she has a long lost half sister! At first Becky is extremely excited, as she's always wanted a sister. However Jess is the exact opposite of Becky. She is frugal, cheap, and not very open. After a few disastrous meetings, it doesn't seem much will come out of their relationship. They just have nothing in common. <br /> <br />Things take a turn for the worst when Becky's spending, as usual, gets completely out of control and threatens to destroy their marriage. On a whim she decides to go visit the small town her long-lost half sister lives in and make peace, no matter what it takes. Will she succeed, or will she make an even bigger disaster out of things? Or has Becky truly gone too far this time? <br /> <br />\\"Shopaholic and Sister\\", I have to say, is now one of my official favorite book in the series. It had the truly insane adventures and hilarity that only Becky Bloomwood could get herself into. This time, they include: a horse-ride which Becky managed to turn into an impromptu shopping trip that had me rolling with laughter; an exciting shopping trip in Milan that resulted with Becky buying a purse for $2000 Euros; and the scenario between Luke and Becky when the two lorries full of junk Becky had purchased on their honeymoon arrived at their tiny new flat. And that's only the beginning. Sophie Kinsella outdid herself with Shopaholic and Sister in my opinion. I cracked up with laughter more than once, shook my head at Becky's antics, and even found myself touched with some of the issues Becky had with her sister and best friend Suze. <br /> <br />As the other books in the series, \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" is well-written, engaging and full of colorful characters. There are a few over-the-top scenarios in Shopaholic and Sister that some may shake their head at, and some may get annoyed with Becky's obsessive-compulsive behavior, but I didn't. I absolutely loved the book and highly recommend it to everyone. People who have enjoyed the Shopaholic books until now won't be disappointed with this latest installment.	2005-05-16

That's a question you will have answered in this hilarious, absorbing novel.  There is:  Danielle, a spoiled Texan who has just moved to the big Apple looking for adventure and independence from her overbearing family; Greta, a very tall, loud German woman who has just caught her boyfriend cheating on her with a woman half her size; and Edie, a struggling actress whose boyfriend has just deserted her for Uzbekistan.    This book was very hard for me to put down. I had to keep reading to see what would happen to the three women. Would Danielle ever get on her feet and stop being so self-absorbed? Will Greta open up to her roommates and start being honest? Will Edie wise up to the fact that her boyfriend may not be coming back and get on with her life?  The characters were truly what made this book such a delightful read - they were quirky and delightful.    I highly recommend this book. Although the story is told from three viewpoints, Liz Ireland handles it like a pro and makes a clear distinction between the characters. This novel's only downfall is a tiny bit of predictability, but I have to say this is one of the only books that has ever made me burst out laughing on the very last page.	2005-05-16

She has just about completed her latest novel when she hears the bad news: famous movie producer Michael Tolsky has committed suicide.  Sophie thinks it is odd that his \\"suicide\\" was done just as a scene in  his movie was done.  Also, Tolsky was supposed to be making one of Sophie's books into a movie.  Needless to say, she is a bit upset.  Things don't get much better when other people begin dropping like flies around her - and their deaths begin resembling scenes from one of her bestselling novels. <br /> <br />Around the same time, Sophie begins finding tiny clues that someone is following her around and breaking into her apartment.  Things such as a broken glass in the middle of her kitchen floor and a book out of place in her bookcase that she knows she didn't touch.  When her car is completely vandalized, Sophie knows that someone is out to get her - using methods she described in her book.   The question is, who is doing it?  There is a wide array of people to choose from, such as the hunky, difficult Russian guy named Anatoly who has recently moved into her neighborhood (and on whom she has a crush).  There is also: the brain-damaged neighbor who seems to have a crush on her; her gay best friend Marcus, who has a new love;  her friend Dena's new boyfriend Jason, who is very suspiciously into vampires.   <br /> <br />Will Sophie make it out of this mystery alive, without losing any loved ones (or her sanity) in the process? <br /> <br />\\"Sex, Murder and a Double Latte\\" was a totally addictive read that I simply could not put down.  Sophie as a main character is great - she isvery funny, sharp and realistic.  The other characters that color the pages are also amusing.  A lot of the dialogue in this book is laugh-out-loud funny, and Kyra Davis kept me guessing until the very end who the killer was.   <br /> <br />With such a solid, suspenseful and witty story line, I could find very little wrong with this book, except that the main character has the annoyingly stereotypical gay best friend and quirky cat.  Also, the dumb-as-bricks police force bit was a little overdone.  However, this novel was so good that these things didn't matter very much.   <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend any mystery and/or chick lit fan to give this book a read.  Just don't start it too late at night, or you'll be up reading all night!	2005-05-16

And sure enough, she is!  Working as an accountant, Rory is currently dating a boring Star Wars geek, and although she herself is a non-boring Star Wars geek, the sparks just aren't there between them.    However, after Rory runs into an old crush from grade school - the handsome Hunter Chase, her best friend Allison convinces her to go after him.  Rory decides to go through with it.  The results that ensue are slightly disastrous but entertaining.  Rory hides her true vegetarian, Star-wars-convention attending geeky self and begins to win Hunter over.  But will it last?  Will she succeed in getting the man of her dreams and in the process lose herself?    For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  It was a sweet, romantic novel with a likeable heroine and a fun story line that kept me reading.  It carries a good message as well, about loving and being yourself above all else.  Some of Rory's dating antics make me laugh out loud as well.    The only thing I had a problem with in this novel was that the main character kept saying \\"Creator!\\" and \\"Oh, Creator!\\" as sort of a curse.  It got very annoying, and some people could find it offensive.    However, I recommend giving this a read if you are in the mood for a solid, sweet chick lit tale.	2005-05-16

Ashley Stockingdale, a successful patent attorney, seems to have it all: a great condo in Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, CA), a great job, a sporty car, and a great group of Christian friends whom she calls \\"The Reasons\\". She wants to settle down and get married - preferably with Seth, a handsome, blue-eyed man in The Reasons. At 31, she feels her time is running out. <br /> <br />Fed up with doing the same thing with the same people day after day, week after week, Ashley decides one day to change her attitude and outlook on life. Before she knows it, she has met a very handsome doctor who has just broken up with his girlfriend. At the same time, Seth decides to enlist her help in getting the attention of a beautiful young woman, who happens to be the handsome doctor's ex-girlfriend. As if things aren't complicated enough, Ashley's job begins sending her to Thailand for business, and she discovers she has to move due to some unpleasant infestation problems. Just when Ashley's life seems to be filled with excitement and new men, she wonders if her old comfortable life might have been enough. <br /> <br />This book was a wonderful read.  Best of all was the main character Ashley - who was a woman everyone could identify with on some level. She is smart, down-to-earth, funny, has morals, and is slightly spoiled. She doesn't always to the right thing, but whatever she does, you will be rooting for her. Also the story line of this novel was addicting - I just had to keep reading to find out what would happen next! The supporting characters are a quirky and interesting bunch that add even more appeal to this book. <br /> <br />The writing in this book is worth mentioning. Kristin Billerbeck has a very readable style and flows easily from one scene to another. Told in first-person narrative, the story is lively and detailed enough that I felt I was right there in every scene! <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book. This is a Christian chick lit novel, but I'm certain that most women could identify and enjoy the main character and plot. This novel is the first of the three-book Ashley Stockingdale series.	2005-05-15

She is thirty-something, has a few extra pounds padding her figure, and just wants to meet a good Christian man to settle down with. Unfortunately she is laid off from her job writing obituaries, and must find something else to do. At the same time, her best friend Lindsey signs her up for an online personals service. After at least one disastrous date resulting from the dating service, Phoebe thinks she has met the email man of her dreams. But then she gets a call from her mother who has become injured and needs Phoebe to fly home to the small California town she grew up in. <br /> <br />Back at home, Phoebe has her hands full with the town's newspaper, which lost one its oldest reporters. Her mother also keeps her busy, as does a couple of other causes Phoebe can't resist getting involved with. Her dating life is pretty much non-existant, since the only man that seems to be available is the infuriatingly handsome yet seemingly moral-lacking Alex, who was responsible for Phoebe's layoff back in Cleveland. But is there more that meets the eye to this guy? <br /> <br />For the most part, I enjoyed \\"Dreaming in Black and White\\". Phoebe was an endearing heroine, and the supporting characters were vibrant and well-defined. This novel is packed with the ingredients of a good chick lit book, such as romance, career angst, family issues, and a girl trying to find her way in life. <br /> <br />However, there were some downfalls to this novel. I knew exactly how it would end - it was very predictable. The story line also dragged out needlessly and too many sideplots and characters were crowding the pages. In my opinion, the plot could have been tightened up a notch. Also, Phoebe's dislike for Alex seemed overly exaggerated. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to Christian chick lit fans, and regular chick lit fans who want something different. It's a fun and feel-good read that many will enjoy.  I am looking forward to the sequel, which comesout in September 2005!	2005-05-15

Just when she thinks things can't get much worse, her best friend Ben drops the bomb that he is getting married... to his Park Avenue girlfriend.  That in itself isn't so bad, but Rachel has always secretly wondered what would happen if she had ended up as his girlfriend, instead of just his friend.  Now it seems she is too late. <br /> <br />Bored with her sudden joblessness, Rachel flits from temp job to temp job, until one night, as a joke, she decides to start a letter-writing business.  More specifically, a business where she would help prospective business-school applicants write their entrance essays and letters.  After papering Manhattan with leaflets containing her name and phone number advertising her business, she promptly forgets about it... until she gets her first call from someone wanting to hire her.  Around the same time, Rachel starts a new temping gig at an environmental information company and makes friends with Zach, the art director.  Zach is not her type at all, but they hit it off as great friends, and she ends up regaling him with tales of her disastrous dates and work scenarios.  Zach surprises her by turning her stories into fodder for the heroine of a  hilarious comic strip on his website.    <br /> <br />Just when I was contemplating giving up on co-written books, Shaking Her Assets turned out to be the great single-girl-in-the-city book to change my mind.  This book is warm, witty, and genuinely interested me in the main character's life.  Epstein and Kaplan's writing blended together well enough where I couldn't tell their writing apart- to me, it was just one very well-written and entertaining book. <br /> <br />Best of all, there are genuinely hilarious examples of the comic strip that is loosely based on Rachel's life occasionally thrown into the book sporadically.  The authors don't overdue it by including one in every chapter -although they were funny enough that I wouldn't have minded!   <br /> <br />Overall, this was a wonderful read, and I definitely suggest picking yourself up a copy.  Be prepared to laugh out loud!	2005-05-12

Holly now lives alone and works as an event planner in the bustling city of San Francisco. When her boss Olivia accosts her one day and says she must either do something about her personal life or think about getting another job, Holly has little choice but to join Olivia and her friends for drinks out. Although the night is somewhat uneventful and humiliating, it does show Holly that it's time to take control of her life. <br /> <br />As she makes her way through the ups and downs of shedding some weight and going on some laughably bad dates, Holly decides to throw herself into helping plan a charity event that benefits hospice patients. The only problem is that Olivia doesn't know what she is doing, and if she finds out.. there will most likely be hell to pay - perhaps even her job. But Holly doesn't give up, even when the going gets extremely tough. At the same time, she learns that she isn't quite ready to give up on herself yet. <br /> <br />\\"The Frog Prince\\" was an absolutely wonderful read. You would never know that author Jane Porter has recently crossed over into the chick lit genre from romance. The book is subtle, sweet, sometimes sad, and sometimes funny- but always true to life. Porter did an awesome job at capturing the true angst of a newly-divorced woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life. The writing in this book flows seamlessly from one scene to the next, and Holly is such an interesting, slightly flawed yet likeable character that one will feel they are there, experiencing the things she does. <br /> <br />I couldn't find one thing about this book I didn't like. Even when Holly was at her lowest point, she didn't act like a wet dishrag or doormat - and that, in my opinion, is highly commendable in chicklit. <br /> <br />Overall - this is an amazing book!	2005-05-12

There are five engaging main characters in Sleeping Over, Stacey Ballis's latest novel: Jess, who has just returned home from the Peace Corps and ends up in bed with the handsome and charming Dr. Harrison. Since he is known as a womanizer, Jess intends to steer clear... but why are they sleeping together every night? Robin meanwhile has been busy cozying up to Michael, who is also her boss. But they are \\"just friends\\"... although Robin is nursing strong feelings for him. Beth and Anne are sisters, and both going through man troubles of their own: Anne has just met the enchanting Chris, and is slowly falling in love. Beth has had a lot of bad luck with men - after getting out of a long relationship with a selfish but incredibly intelligent man. Lastly, there is Lilith. She is torn between an adorable and sweet bartender, and a married actor whom she can't stop thinking about. Then there is her boyfriend... <br /> <br />The five stories are told in short chapters, going from one character to the next pretty quickly. Each woman is \\"sleeping\\" with a man - literally. <br /> <br />I found this book to be a good read overall. The characters were real, unique and quirky, and each had their own situations to work out and emotional issues to overcome. Each woman's story drew me in and made me want to keep reading. <br /> <br />The problem with this book is typical of multiple-perspective novels - there was too much going on. Five characters is a lot to keep up with, especially when each one introduces a whole new set of men and situations. Although I managed to finally get them all down, I was very disappointed at the end. For no apparent reason, some of the characters' conclusions were told from the other characters' points of views. I have no idea why the author did this. For instance, Beth may have started off telling her own story, but in order to find out how her situation ended, you would have to read it while another character was talking. <br /> <br />Another slight downfall to the book was that the chapters were very short. Just as I was getting into one story than BAM - it was another character's turn. One last problem I had was that most of the book seemed to be just too good to be true and not very realistic. <br /> <br />Overall however, this was an interesting chick lit read. It stands apart from other novels because of its many perspectives and feel-good tone. I'd recommend giving it a try!	2005-03-29

She is lonely, having just been in town for a month. She has a job in a high-fashion boutique, but still hasn't made any friends. So after a month of being lonely, she decides something must be done.

And one day Natalie decides to open an invitation, just out of curiosity. <br /> <br />As soon as she opens the letter, things begin happening. She starts making friends at work, finally meets the adorable guy upstairs who always has parties, goes on a blind date, and gets invited to all kinds of parties. Mind you, the people at the parties think she is Cressida. As does her blind date, the handsome Simon Rutherford, whom she might be falling in love with... <br /> <br />\\"Little White Lies\\" was a funny, endearing read. The main character is funny, down-to-earth and always means well. But as with many things in life that people mean to do honestly but don't, bad consequences happen. As Natalie got deeper and deeper into her dishonest life, the story's suspense grows. Gemma Townley has a warm and highly addictive way with words which will keep many reading far into the night. I also love how the main character did have to suffer for her wrongdoings - it made the story that much more realistic. <br /> <br />The only downside to this novel was that the story was that near the end, it became a little predictable and was drawn out a little longer than it needed to be. <br /> <br />Overall, I adored this book and highly recommend it to all chick lit fans, and anyone who likes a good book about a character with good intentions that have gone awry. This book will certainly bring many new Gemma Townley fans!	2005-03-29

This novel explores the unusual topic of selling one's soul - to the devil. V - the main character, (she isn't allowed to tell you her real name) was once a size 14 with lumpy thighs, a mediocre life and job, and was miserable. That all changed when V decided to sign her soul over to the devil - in exchange for beauty, powers, wealth and fame. There are different levels of the program (called \\"the Life Enrichment Program\\"). Your powers increase with each level. There are some catches, of course. In order to move through the levels, you have to recruit other people into the program. You have to practice apathy at all times, and you must be discreet. <br /> <br />So in the beginning of the story, V has already signed her soul over to the devil. The devil's name is Lucy - and she is a beautiful woman who is coveted by many, and writes a weekly column that gives the dish on the who is who and what is what in Manhattan. So V is pretty content at first with her new powers and beauty and fame, but she begins to see that there are many downsides to Lucy's program. Such as, she has to continually try and recruit people into selling their soul. She is not supposed to help anyone or do any good deeds. And when she dares go against the devil's plans, there is definitely hell to pay... <br /> <br />V starts to wonder if she made a mistake in selling her soul. After all, her life just isn't the same without one. Sure, she has wealth, success, power... but what about helping others, falling in love and just plain life contentment? V knows she is in deep, but is there a way out? <br /> <br />I had mixed feelings while reading this book. On one hand, it is very original, bitingly funny and has some hilarious dialogue between the characters. The pace is frantic, and the story is very suspenseful. On the other hand, I had a hard time wrapping my imagination around the plot, which was very far-fetched. I have no problem with fantasy or paranormal novels, but in chick lit - it's got tobe somewhat believable. For the most part, this book was. <br /> <br />I have to admit, Kathleen O'Reilly really did a wonderful job of handling such a delicate subject matter (to some). The ending of this novel made up for anything I might have not liked in the story - it was excellent! <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend this book. It pushes the envelope with its daring plot, and will make you laugh out loud more than once.	2005-03-29

Her boyfriend seems suspiciously cozy with his gorgeous editor (who clearly dislikes Lisa); Lisa gets a call from her own editor back in New Sparta with very bad news about her column - she's being sued. Throw in a famous rock star who seems obsessed with her and a stint at Harrods where she pretends to be a true Brit. <br /> <br />As things begin crumbling around her, Lisa wonders if she's made a mistake in moving to London. I enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. Lisa Marie comes across as a very original, offbeat and unusual main heroine. The writing is also different - Lisa's story is told from a third-person narrative. All at once this novel seems to be about everything and nothing, but it draws you in. <br /> <br />A really fascinating thing about Lisa Marie Takes Off is that the author explores many of the British/American stereotypes. She tackles both the American and British sides of it, and it's laugh-out-loud funny. <br /> <br />The only downfall to this novel was that it seemed a bit far-fetched in some places. However, it was enough to make me like the book any less. <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend this book. Hubbard's intriguing and refreshingly original and unusual third-person narrative writing style will absorb you into Lisa Marie's life and keep you reading until the end.	2005-03-29

That's how Lara Stone, main heroine of this book, finds herself. She had been putting off getting pregnant for some time - because after all, she had finally worked her way down to a size 4. As an admissions counselor at Bel Air Prep, Lara doesn't have time to have a kid. However, her husband Andrew gives her an ultimatum one night: either agree to have a child, or reassess your marriage priorities. (In other words, \\"get pregnant or get out\\"). <br /> <br />So after several tries, Lara finds herself pregnant. She vows from the start that she will not get fat like all the other pregnant women out there, and will not be one of those weepy, weak women. But her hormones seems to have a different idea when she discovers that not only is she gaining weight steadily, but her emotions are out of control and she develops hemorrhoids, among other things. At the same time, she is challenged at work to help Tick, a famous movie director's wayward daughter, get into a decent college. Lara's boss makes a deal with her: either get Tick into an Ivy league school, or plan to work full time next year after maternity leave. <br /> <br />Notes From the Underbelly was an absolutely hilarious read. Lara as a main character is fantastic, if a little rough around the edges: she is mean and she is not putting up with anything. The many pregnancy conditions she goes through are fun to read about. Author Risa Green kept me laughing throughout the book. The side plot with Tick getting into school only added to the story line, and I also found Lara and Andrew's relationship and conversations very funny. Andrew was the perfect husband to the erratic and lively Lara. <br /> <br />The only downside to this novel was the fact that it seemed Andrew had forced Lara into pregnancy, which in my book is a huge no-no. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to any chick lit fan that enjoys a very humorous read about pregnancy. Women that are looking into getting pregnant in the future might become a little squeamish at some of the details though...	2005-03-29

Working as an assistant to a glamorous events planner, Dalton finds herself torn between two men. There is the handsome, sweet, caring and intellectual Roman, who has just proposed - and then taken off to Africa for a six month trip. Then there is Jeremy, who is irresistibly attractive, frustratingly hot-and-cold, and just somehow gets under Dalton's skin. Never mind the fact that Jeremy already has a girlfriend. Dalton never intended to keep seeing Jeremy, but somehow, she can't help herself. And her fianc Roman seems to never be around! <br /> <br />Through alcohol-soaked nights, run-ins with her arch-rival from high school, dealing with her zany roommates (also going through guy troubles), Dalton must figure out which guy she really likes - before it is too late. <br /> <br />A Love Like That was a very interesting look at relationship angst, cheating, being alone, and what happens when you are torn between two people you really love in totally different ways. Amanda Hill's writing is witty and outrageous - the characters don't mince words or actions. Dalton as a main heroine is all at once quirky, impulsive, mixed up, and irritating at times, but you will fall in love with her. <br /> <br />The plot to this novel has all of the essential chick lit ingredients: laughter, tears, escapism, naughtiness, strength, and fun. <br /> <br />Some might be put off by the excessive cursing that the characters do and might think that Dalton is a crude and selfish main heroine. It didn't bother me though. I personally love characters that make mistakes and are human like the rest of us. Also, some will be put off by the cheating that goes on throughout the novel. However, I didn't mind because I don't read chick lit in order to find directions in my life - I read it for entertainment. Sometimes it is very interesting reading about a character doing a bunch of things you yourself would never do,right? <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this great chick lit novel to all fans, and to anyone who loves an offbeat story.	2005-03-29

If you've ever been curious about what it's like to visit many of Europe's hot spots, you'll love this book. <br /> <br />Jadie Peregrine is tired of her boring office job. She desperately wants to break into writing full-time, but so far she's had little luck. The city of Boulder, CO that she lives in is just not prime dating ground either - she's had nothing but miserable dating experiences. What she wants to do more than anything is take off and travel through Europe. But how can she afford it? While pondering this very question, she is suddenly hit with an idea: what if she were to travel the world and write a book on the differences and similarities of dating in other cultures and countries? <br /> <br />Jadie manages to get the time off from work and gather her best friend Tate, and together they head to Europe, starting in London. What follows is plenty of adventures, meeting men, interviewing locals on dating customs, and soon Jadie has found someone she thinks may be the man of her dreams. Tate meanwhile doesn't seem to be thrilled with the men she encounters, although many of them are nice. Will she find someone she likes? Will Jadie manage to write the book she planned? Will she discover dating in other countries is the same as dating in Colorado? <br /> <br />I loved The Girls' Global Guide to Guys. It was a fun way to go along with the characters to the many countries and cities they explored. Author Theresa Alan is very descriptive when portraying many of the foods the characters ate and the atmosphere of the many different places. Several chapters of the book are devoted to following the characters around to different places, but it soon heats up after that. Jadie was great as a main character - she was funny, realistic and smart. <br /> <br />The only downside to the novel was that the plot was a tiny bit unrealistic at times.  <br /> <br />Overall, however, I highly recommend this novel to all chick lit fans and to anyone who has ever thought abouttaking a trip abroad. This is a wonderful and fun read not to be missed!	2005-03-29

If you are looking for such a read, this is your novel. This is the third book in the bestselling teen \\"Clique\\" series. <br /> <br />Alicia Rivera is rich, beautiful and tired of following the popular and feared Massie Block around. Although they are both part of the extremely popular and coveted \\"clique\\", Massie Block clearly runs the group and expects all of the girls to do what she says. For instance, the girls have a mandatory Friday night sleepover every week. But one Friday Alicia decides to branch off and have a sleepover of her own. After all, Massie can't get mad over that, can she? Especially if Alicia's jazz dance classmates are invited. <br /> <br />But apparently Massie can, and does, get mad. Thus begins a rivalry between Massie and Alicia that starts off innocently enough but quickly spirals out of control. The girls stop at nothing. Alicia is determined to start her own Clique now and steal away the members of the original. Massie is determined to make Alicia regret ever going against her and will stop at nothing. <br /> <br />With a non-stop action-filled plot, plenty of beautiful and cool characters, I found this book to be a wonderful read. Once I started this novel I simply couldn't put it down! Author Lisi Harrison does a wonderful job of getting into the minds of these girls and making the reader side with them. I found myself siding with both characters at different times throughout the book. <br /> <br />One thing about this book is that it's hard to tell how old the girls are. They seem to be in middle school (I actually thought they were teens at first) but I think by the way it's hard to discern the ages makes this book that much more enjoyable for even adults to read. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to all readers of all ages. It's a wonderful teen chick lit novel filled with backstabbing, friendship, and good fun.	2005-03-22

After having her purse snatched while waiting for the bus with her friend Jenny one evening, she comes across something very disturbing in a graveyard.  Blessed (or is it cursed?) with the gift of clairvoyance, it's not the first time Tabitha has been able to see visions of horrible things to come.  Sure enough, she is soon thrown headlong into a mystery involving a woman's death, two handsome men, an old abandoned building, disgusting beetle bugs, and frightening nightmars and visions.  Somehow she must get to the bottom of the mystery because it seems whoever is responsible has chosen her for his next victim... <br /> <br />With a plethora of intriguing details about witchcraft and clairvoyance mixed in with drinks with the girls, dates with handsome unobtainable men, and Tabitha's mounting frustration, \\"Dating Can Be Deadly\\" was a very satisfying read.  The author does an amazing job of capturing the reader's attention and holding it until the end.  No predictability about the plot whatsover - I was hooked until the very last page because of the suspense.  This book could easily fall into the Paranormal chick lit category because of Tabitha's gift, but is also quite at home in the mystery category.  <br /> <br />\\"Dating Can Be Deadly\\" has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and a frothy concoction of drinks, dates and dead bodies.  I simply loved this book! <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend this book to all Mystery and chick lit fans alike.  There is something for everyone in this hilarious and suspenseful novel - don't miss it!	2005-03-17

Girl keeps intending to leave boyfriend but is too weak.  On the sidelines is an old guy friend who is cute and nice who you know girl will end up with.  Girl doesn't realize she has feelings for nice guy until nearly the end of the story.  Then jerk boyfriend comes back for one more go-round.  Girl realizes her mistake almost too late but ends up with nice guy in end.   <br /> <br />Sound familiar? <br /> <br />\\"The Goddess Rules\\" by Clare Naylor features a slight variation of the above story.  Meet Kate Disney.  She lives in a shed, she paints animals for a living, and is unhappy with her life. Yes, the requisite gay best friend is around.  But this time there is another character, the fascinating Mirri.  Mirri is an old-time movie star who drinks, smokes, has sex with men any old time she pleases, and knows the ins and outs of love, men, and how to make a man fall in love with you.  After a somewhat rough introduction to her (walking in on Kate and her jerk boyfriend in the middle of them... getting busy), Kate decides she doesn't much like Mirri.  Mirri seems to think Kate is dowdy, lets men run all over her, and doesn't know anything about keeping a man interested. <br /> <br />But when Kate's jerk boyfriend Jake doesn't show up for her birthday party, she begins to realize that maybe Mirri might be on to something.  And thus begins an unlikely friendship... and Kate begins to learn about life, love and happiness.  And perhaps find a true love that has been there all along. <br /> <br />I enjoyed The Goddess Rules.  It was a nice blend of romance, comedy, and fascinating characters.  Despite the much-recycled plot, it managed to throw in some surprising plot twists and turns.  The writing style was addictive and the story flowed well. <br /> <br />The downfall to this book was just the predictability of the overall story.  Also, Kate let herself be treated so badly by her boyfriend that it got pretty annoying.  She needed a good slap in the face (not literally of course) to wake her up.  Thankfully the brash and enigmatic Mirri was around to do it. <br /> <br />Overall, this was another great read from Clare Naylor.  I definitely recommend it to all chick lit fans, and anyone who enjoys a great book!	2005-03-12

Now her mother is angry with her, and her family thinks something is wrong with her. <br /> <br />With her mother getting more and more controlling, Tamara decides to put her dreams to break free into reality. She gets a part-time job at a gallery in Los Angeles and a tiny apartment. Much to her mother's strong protest and threats that she will no longer speak to her, Tamara moves out. And that's not all - there is the handsome Will, with whom she went to kindergarten, and have always been attracted to. Now that she is on her own and forced to be in contact with him (because of her job), their mutual attraction begins burning out of control. <br /> <br />But Tamara's mother is no longer speaking to her, and she will also surely disapprove of Will.  Is Tamara going to be able to make amends with her mother?  Is her burgeoning relationship with Will going to go anywhere, or is it just a fling? <br /> <br />Hot Tamara was a good, solid and well-written novel. The characters were all interesting, and it was fascinating to read about the Latino family culture and life. Tamara was also a good heroine because she was intelligent and very realistic. The story's overall tone was romantic and charming. <br /> <br />However, sometimes the characters utter Spanish phrases, and the they weren't followed with an English explanation. Being somewhat bilingual in Spanish, I pretty much knew what they meant, but other readers who don't know any Spanish won't. Some (if not all) of the phrases are explained in the back of the book Also, Tamara's mother was really hard to like, because she was just plain rude and horrible to her daughter with no understandable reason. <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend \\"Hot Tamara\\" for a light, romantic and engaging read. A plus to this book is the Q & A at the end of the novel, where the author explains the ins and outs of the story plot. Don't miss this one!	2005-03-12

Things are going OK for her - she is a \\"coolhunter\\" at Pravda, (a trend forecasting company), and has recently broken up with her last boyfriend Ian because he based a character in his novel (quite unflatteringly) on her.  But lately her job seems to lack the excitement it once did for her.  For one thing, Mim Warner, her boss and co-owner of the company, has lately been extremely careless.  Her latest trend forecasts, which are outrageous and unlike her, have lost business for the company.  As a matter of fact, she has horrified her fellow staff and colleagues enough for them to decide on a strategy to silence her for a while - until she \\"gets better\\".  After all, none of them will have jobs if they lose any more accounts! <br /> <br />Meghan has seen the other side of Mim though - her caring side, and greatly admires Mim as a person, so she decides that she had better find out for herself what is going on.  She unintentionally begins stalking Mim, and what she ends up finding both horrifies and shocks her.  Meanwhile, Meghan has her own personal problems to deal with, such as her attachment to her ex-boyfriend Ian, whom she can't seem to completely let go of.     <br /> <br />I ended up loving this book.  About halfway through, I was completely hooked - I had to keep reading to find out what would happen to Mim, Meghan, and Ian.  Lynn Messina did an excellent job of creating both palpable suspense and very intriguing characters in this book.  The story is told from Meghan's perspective in a first-person point of view, but Mim Warner herself was an amazingly well-drawn character.  I felt I got to know Mim and Meghan better than I know many people in person!   <br /> <br />This novel also has the general fun chick lit plot elements, such as a little bit of froth, glamour, relationship angst, and humor.  The wonderful characterization, Meghan's curiously offbeat view on life, and suspenseful story line add a lot more substance.  Regarding the story line, the far-fetched nature of it could have ruined the book had it not been for the excellent handling by the author. <br /> <br />Other than the first few chapters being a tiny bit vapid, there was nothing I would change about this book.   <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book for a great and unusual read, and I'm eagerly looking forward to this author's next book!	2005-03-09

Emily Briggs, our main heroine, has just been proposed to by boyfriend Henry. Although Emily has always promised herself she wouldn't become \\"one of those horrible, obsessive brides-to-be\\", she starts showing signs of it right away. Her annoying mother adds into the fray, trying to take over many of the details. Throw in an attractive guy that Emily seems to have a thing for, moving into a new apartment with Henry, and more - things don't seem to be going the way she planned. Since I was truly confused at what was going on half of the time in the story, I really can't give a better plot synopsis. <br /> <br />This book had some amusing moments. The entire novel is filled with Emily's sporadic and jumbled thoughts that get thrown in the midst of paragraphs where things are happening to characters. Some of her thoughts are funny, as Emily seems to be a vibrant and odd character. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that is about all the entertainment I gleaned from this novel. <br /> <br />The downfalls of this book unfortunately are numerous. The writing of this book is truly horrible. There were too many run-on sentences where the author started to say one thing, then suddenly, in the same sentence, went into the character's thought process, which was truly bizzare most of the time. For the most part, I had no clue what what this book was supposed to be about. (I initially read the back cover, but it didn't at all seem to match up with what was going on in the book). I couldn't figure out why Emily even wanted to marry Henry - he was lifeless as the male love interest, and he got stranger as the book went on. Emily generally makes her way around Manhattan on seemingly needless trips pertaining to her upcoming wedding that usually resulted in some kind of disaster or mishap. <br /> <br />Overall, I cannot with good intention recommend this novel at all. Chick lit fans - steer clear unless you are in the mood for 379 pages of confusion.	2005-03-06

I definitely think so - as long as people are willing to work on their relationship.  Robyn Sisman, author of \\"Summer in the City\\" seems to think so too.   <br /> <br />Meet Lloyd and Suze.  They are total opposites - Lloyd lives in NYC, is responsible, straight and has a devoted girlfriend named Betsy.  Suze on the other hand lives in London, is unpredictable, scattered, and single.  The two of them work for the same company but in different countries.  When the company asks them to switch places for the summer, they both agree.  Lloyd, accompanied by his perfect girlfriend Betsy move into Suze's untidy flat in London, while Suze happily moves into their pristine apartment in NYC. <br /> <br />Suze eagerly takes to living in NYC - complete with new best friend at the office, dates, drinks and clubs, and more.  Lloyd also soaks up the british culture and loves it.  When Suze discovers however that something odd is going on in the office concerning Lloyd's position in the NYC office, she realizes she must do something about it.  The two of them begin chatting on the phone, and realize that maybe there might be something special there.  But what about the wonderful and brainy Betsy?  And what about Nick, the handsome and well-connected man Suze has been seeing in NYC?   <br /> <br />I loved this book.  It was a fabulous blend of surprisingly hilarious wit, romance, and great storytelling.  The author did a great and convincing job of telling the story from both character's points of view.  From disastrous dates, to laugh-out-loud moments, to office politics - this novel had it all. <br /> <br />The only downside to this novel is that it became a tiny bit predictable, and dragged out a bit more than it probably should have.   <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good British chick lit novel told from both a guy and girl's point of view.	2005-03-01

That is the tough decision that Gwen Traynor, heroine of \\"Exes and Ohs\\", must make, and fast - before someone finds out and gets hurt. Gwen is just finishing her Masters program at UCLA, and is interning as a therapist. One day she runs into an ex boyfriend who completely broke her heart, and just as she's about to have a public meltdown on a busy street, along comes the handsome Alex Coughlin. He manages to calm her down, (not before she hurls her cell phone into traffic) and they end up spending the afternoon together, getting to know each other. Alex seems to be the perfect man. He is intelligent, wants a relationship, and is dying to have kids of his own some day. <br /> <br />But just when she thinks she has met a real, interesting, handsome and available man, Gwen discovers something very disturbing. She has a four-year-old client named Leo whom she is counseling on a regular basis. Leo's mother, she finds out, is Harmony, Alex's ex-fianc. Worse yet, Harmony, not knowing Gwen and Alex are dating (or even know each other) confesses to Gwen that Alex is the unknowing father to her child. Gwen is torn between wanting to tell him, but also knowing she can't because of her professional involvement with Leo. <br /> <br />However, the decision is taken out of Gwen's hands abruptly when Harmony confesses to Alex over the phone - from Gwen's office. Soon Alex is mad at her, Leo is running away from home, Harmony is practically forcing Alex to get back together with her, Alex has fallen in love with his son and believes he needs to move back in with Harmony, and Gwen is fed up. She can't believe she has been dumped... again. <br /> <br />Once again, Beth Kendrick has spun a fantastically witty and outrageous romantic chick lit comedy. This novel contains her trademark humor and endearing characters. The plot in this novel never stops - it plunges you right into Gwen's life and the chaos that rules it. The characters are funny and entertaining, and Gwen is a main heroine that you will just like from the start, regardless of her slight naivet and the mistakes she makes. <br /> <br />This is a story of men, roommates, romance, parenthood, breaking up, ethical work practices, and finding yourself when all seems lost. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great chick lit book, or a zany romantic comedy!	2005-02-22

I was excited when I heard Sarah Mlynowski had written a teen chick lit/fantasy book - especially since she is one of my favorite chick lit authors! <br /> <br />Meet Rachel. She is 14, unpopular and and suffering from the usual teenage angst. That all changes one day when she discovers that her younger sister Miri is a witch. Yes, a witch. Apparently it was passed down from their mother. While Rachel wonders why she didn't inherit her mother's powers, she knows that she can convince Miri to help her cast spells to help her out. (Behind their mother's back, of course). For instance, there is a freshman fashion show coming up. Rachel knew if she got chosen to be in it, she'd become popular and get invited to the A-list parties. Too bad that normally she couldn't dance to save her own life. <br /> <br />Although the girls' mother warns Miri not to use her powers until she is fully trained in them, under Rachel's begging and pleading, Miri begins doing some small spells to help out. First it's just to help Rachel become a dancer. Then there is the zit-away concoction. Then the girls decide to try and break up their father's soon-to-be-wedding with a woman they feel is horrible and two-faced. Meanwhile Rachel is ecstatic with her newfound popularity - not only did she get chosen to be in the freshman fashion show as a dancer, but she suddenly is dating one of the most handsome boys in school, and the A-list is inviting her to parties. <br /> <br />But after a few disasters and spells-gone-wrong, the girls realize they might be in over their heads. Maybe their mother was right. Will Rachel end up losing her new popularity and best friend? Will she make a complete fool of herself in front of the school? Will the girls' dad end up making the biggest mistake of his life? Find out this and more by reading this delightful novel. <br /> <br />This book was a wonderful read. It has all of the ingredients you could ever want in a teen fantasy chick lit novel: family angst, friendship and popularity dilemmas, crushes, parties, magic, and more. Mlynowski's trademark wit, warmth, and addictive storytelling come through in this book stronger than ever. Reading her novels is usually like having your best friend confide juicy secrets to you, but even better - and Bras and Broomsticks is no exception! The characters and dialogue are realistic, and the plot is original and absorbing. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Bras and Broomsticks to all chick lit and fantasy fans of all ages. Adult readers will forget they are reading a teen novel as they get lost in the pages of this book, and teen readers will be delighted.

I certainly have on many occasions. However, I've discovered that some of the most awful-sounding titles cloak some of the best stories. This is one such book. I absolutely loved Liz Ireland's previous book \\"Three Bedrooms in Chelsea\\". This latest novel is yet another wonderful read! <br /> <br />Meet Alison Bell, our main heroine. She was once a rich girl and grew up in a very nice part of Dallas, TX, but her father has since went bankrupt and went to live the simple life on a ranch. Alison is now on her own and in her late twenties, living in a squalid apartment, and looking for a new job. She finds a wonderful opportunity in the newspaper and goes to inquire about it. The ad was looking for a nanny, with possible relocation to New York City. This particularly appeals to Alison since her best friend from college relocated there years ago. <br /> <br />Imagine Alison's mortification and surprise when she discovers the woman who is interviewing her for the nanny job is none other than Pepper McClintock. Not only was Pepper a rival of Alison's since the tender age of 5, but Pepper had stolen and apparently married Alison's one true love, Spence Smith! Pepper and Spence are married with a beautiful child, and very well off, while Alison is single, poor, and looking for work as a nanny. <br /> <br />However, Pepper manages to talk Alison in to taking the job. Alison discovers a few things pretty quickly. First off, she isn't really nanny material. Second, Pepper is certainly holding a grudge against her. And third, she isn't quite over Spence yet... The entire situation is a recipe for disaster! When they do relocate to New York City, things get even more insane. <br /> <br />Despite the ridiculous title, I loved this book. Liz Ireland has crafted a fantastic, multi-layered and impossible-to-put-down story. She seems to have a knack for creating irresistably offbeat characters with both good and bad qualities. I must add that this book really much about stealing husbands and getting revenge. (The back cover certainly exaggerates). Alison is a great main heroine despite her many weaknesses and passivity. The plot, which goes from the present to past tense (so the reader can see why Pepper and Alison have so much angst between them), is absorbing and exciting. <br /> <br />There were a couple of things in the story I found irritating. One was Spence's character. He wasn't in enough scenes for the reader to get a good sense about his personality, and when he did show up, he seemed lifeless and like a cardboard cutout. (What DID Alison and Pepper see in him??) Also, as mentioned above, Alison was very passive at times - to the point of me wanting to give her a good shake. However, even those things weren't enough to make this less than a five star read. <br /> <br />Overall, this is one book you do NOT want to miss!	2005-02-16

After finishing this third wonderful novel by Stephanie Lehmann, I've discovered a few things. First off, she is near the very top of my list of favorite writers. Second, there is a definite trend with her books. Not only do they all have daring titles that cloak true gems of the stories within the pages, but they feature main heroines that are flawed in some way, but are also seriously likeable.  <br /> <br />In this third novel, \\"The Art of Undressing\\", we have Ginger Levine. She lives with her ex-exotic dancer mother (named Coco) in Manhattan, attends cooking school paid for by her wayward father, and has just broken up with her boyfriend Ian, who seemed more interested in her mother anyway. Ginger is the complete opposite of her beautiful, outspoken and feminine mother. She dresses much more plainly and is afraid to open up and be \\"sexy\\" around men. Ginger's main problem seems to be that she is overcompensating for her mother's outrageous activities. She feels that she is too plain and un-sexy for a man to like her, but she doesn't know what to do about it. <br /> <br />Not only that, but a guy she likes in her cooking class seems to be spoken for by a gorgeous girl, and the instructor Jean-Paul seems intent on making Ginger miserable enough to quit the class. Meanwhile there are issues to be dealt with at her father's house. Will Ginger give up on her cooking class, and men in general? Or will she realize the help she needed was right in front of her, all along, and that things aren't always what they seem to be? <br /> <br />I enormously enjoyed this novel. Lehmann has used her signature style of subtle humor, straight-forward storytelling and realistic characters to spin yet anther delightful and touching tale. She has a way of taking the most ordinary of characters and making them into someone that everyone can identify with on some level. <br /> <br />Overall, I very highly recommend this book!	2005-02-16

I can't say every book does that to me - in fact, very few do - but this novel certainly did. It turned out to be one of the sort that somehow gets under your skin and makes you think for days after reading it. <br /> <br />Meet Jane Laine. She works for the prominent Dick Reese gallery in New York City. At the beginning of our story she has just been dumped unceremoniously by her boyfriend Jack. She enjoys her artsy job, although Dick Reese, the gallery owner, is a complete tyrant, and at least one of her coworkers is catty and annoying. Jane holds a Master's degree in Art and usually is really good at figuring out the meaning behind each artist's piece. That is, until she comes across Ian Rhys-Fitzsimmons. Ian is known as a genius, and his work is highly regarded throughout the art world. When Jane's boss drops the bomb on her that she has to accompany Ian on a five month international art fair tour, Jane is disappointed. How is she going to promote an artist's work she doesn't even \\"get\\"? And why now, when she is trying to get her love life started back up? <br /> <br />Thus begins Ian and Jane's tour, which starts in England and continues on through Rome, Chicago, and many other places. Through their time spent, Jane begins to slowly learn just what it is about Ian's work that is so popular. And she begins to wonder if maybe she had someone great in front of her the whole time, but just didn't know it... <br /> <br />This book was a very satisfying read. It's a little difficult to pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that I liked so much. Jane as a main character was great - intelligent, down-to-earth, and funny. Ian was a great supporting character - he was very smart, polite, funny, interesting and a bit eccentric. Jane goes through the typical ups and downs of dating while trying to juggle her career and personal life. The book's plot moves smoothly and doesn't waver. If Andy Warhol Had a Girlfriend simmers with a quiet brilliance and polish that will stay in a reader's mind for days. <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend this novel to all readers who enjoy a superb, feel-good yet realistic book.	2005-02-06

Betsy is a loud, smart-mouth woman with a penchant for fine shoes. After a week from hell, she gets hit by a car and dies. However, she wakes up \\"undead\\" - in a coffin. After a few startling discoveries, she realizes that she is not only a vampire, but an extraordinary one. For instance, garlic and crosses don't bother her in the least, and she has superhuman powers - she can scale a building, and fight off other vampires with a flick of her wrist. And more.    After going against the \\"code of vampire ethics\\" and letting her family know she isn't really dead, Betsy attracts the unwelcome (or is it?) attention of Sinclair, an annoyingly handsome and enigmatic vampire who is interested in her for various reasons. She also gets on the hit list of the ruler of vampires and has a contract out for her head (literally) within days. What's a girl to do?     This was a great read - I was unable to put it down once starting it. Mary Janice Davidson has a wonderful gift of storytelling and keeping the reader hooked. Betsy is a heroine that is not to be messed with. The romance in this novel is a subplot to the actual story, which keeps things interesting. This novel is not \\"technically\\" a chick lit novel, but it's not a romance either. It effortlessly falls into the paranormal/vampire chick lit category. (If such a category really exists!)    The only downfall to this novel, I felt, was sometimes Betsy was too loudmouthed. Part of her charm is that she doesn't put up with anything, but occasionally she was just too annoying about it. Some parts of the story were drawn out too long because she refused to listen to anything. I must admit to wanting to smack her into silence a few times.    Overall, I highly recommend this book!	2005-02-06

Anna also lives with two beautiful models (one of which is very stuck up) and who have no qualms in assuring Anna of how ugly she is. If all of that isn't bad enough, she has just been dumped by her boyfriend Brian, who had suffered from halitosis and questionable body odor. The cherry on the pie is Anna's personality. She is horribly acquiescent - to the point of being a complete pushover. <br /> <br />However, her luck is about to change. After her company is taken over by a large corporation, Anna's boss-from-hell Kitty has ordered her to find a movie script that will actually be able to be made into a movie. Anna somehow manages to do that, and manages to find a top-name director to make the movie. This director, the reclusive, handsome and enigmatic Mark Swan, takes an interest in Anna and manages to get her on board with the movie. He also seems rather interested in Anna on a personal level... might it have something to do with her recent makeover? <br /> <br />Too bad Anna is convinced that such a handsome guy isn't interested in her. Instead, she gets caught up with Charles, a man who is rich, but with whom she has absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. When he proposes marriage, Anna's life is thrown into a tailspin. And things only get more insane from there... <br /> <br />Despite Anna's major character flaws, I got so into the story that I ended up finishing it in one night. The narrative is lively and funny, and some romantic suspense is thrown in for good measure. Lastly, the dialogue that occursbetween the many characters is often very humorous. <br /> <br />The major downside to this novel was Anna's doormat character, (at least until the part of the book that she finally grows a backbone).  People that enjoy assertive characters will absolutely despise Anna in the first half of the book. However, good storytelling makes up for these downfalls. <br /> <br />Overall, I definitely recommend giving this book a read. It is a fun, absorbing and interesting novel that one can immerse oneself in for hours.	2005-02-05

I was happily surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel.  Kerry Spence, the main heroine of the novel, is one of those characters who are good enough to make the book, should the book not have a good plot. She is funny (hilarious at times), endearing, clueless in some ways, and vibrant. However, since this book had an excellent plot too, the book ended up being amazingly good. At the beginning of our story, Kerry is stuck in an on-again, off-again type of relationship with Sam, a good-looking guy who she thinks is way out of her league. In order to try and get over the angst this dysfunctional relationship has produced, Kerry begins seeing a therapist, who instructs her to write down some of the most mortifying moments in her life. And mortifying they turn out to be - from a twelve year old kissing game that ended badly, to a horrifying ski \\"date\\" that ended with a terrible bloody nose, to a night where Kerry realized at the end that she had tape stuck on the bridge of her nose throughout her date (hence the odd, strange looks he'd been giving her the entire time), and much more.<br /><br />As Kerry deals with her past, she also has to deal with her present. She is stuck in a soulless advertising job with a horrible boss and a ridiculous co-worker who is not only in love with her, but manages to humiliate her thoroughly when she turns him down. She decides to enroll in a program that helps \\"medium to high risk teens\\", and goes on a few interesting dates. But Kerry realizes that perhaps her therapist wasn't being a total ogre when she'd had her write down her most embarrassing moments. Maybe looking into the past is how she can get her present sorted out...<br /><br />I laughed out loud on more than one occasion while reading this book. The author has a wickedly fresh sense of humor, and mixed together with a plot that will keep you guessing until the end, this is one wonderful and engrossing read. The journal entries only add to the book's overall tone. Think you've had some embarrassing moments in life? Well, after reading this novel you will discover - you are not alone!	2005-01-27

I read this book as soon as I got my hands on it, since I really like Ariella Papa's writing style and previous books.  This book might look like a mommy lit type of novel, but it's really more of a \\"singleton's best friend gets pregnant\\" book, and so much more. <br /> <br />The main heroine Voula is a character that really stands out from the norm. She had a turbulent and somewhat tragic childhood; she has a stubborn Greak mother who believes Voula should be living at home until she is married; she likes to be alone and has only had 2 1/2 boyfriends (technically) in her life so far. She lives with a beautiful Italian man with a large libido and has a freelance writing career that is satisfying, but just paying the bills. <br /> <br />Voula isn't sure if she wants kids one day, but suddenly it seems like everyone around her is getting pregnant: her best friend Jamie, for one. Suddenly the close friend Voula has known since childhood is one of them. At the same time, Voula's long-estranged sister shows up again, toting two kids and a husband. Still further, Voula must find a third roommate, but at the same time is wondering if she should find her own place somewhere. The problem is, how can she afford it? Everyone has heard of the difficulties involved with finding a place to live in Manhattan. Is it really that difficult? Join Voula on her house-hunting adventures and see for yourself! <br /> <br />This book explores a litany of interesting topics: the ups and downs having a newly pregnant best friend; the friend's joy and struggles of pregnancy, childbirth and child-rearing; the uncertain yet exciting new relationship that Voula finds; her struggle to open up to others yet learn to be true to herself. And of course her frustrating yet irresistable hunt for a place to live. <br /> <br />I absolutely LOVED this novel. Ariella Papa, whose previous two books (\\"On the Verge\\" and \\"Up and Out\\") I also loved, has outdone herself this time around. Voula is an outstanding main heroine, and she is dealing with realistic and difficult situations. The overall story line kept me reading straight through until the end. Very highly recommended.	2005-01-22

With a title like that, who could resist? This novel is sort of like a Chick Lit memoir type of book that I instantly loved. <br /> <br />Author Rachel Toor takes the reader into her life starting from college in New England. She chronicles her different relationships with men, struggles along the way, and her different pets and how she related to them. There was Barkus, the dog she'd left behind at her parent's house for college; there was Prudence, the sweet little mouse during her senior year of college; There was Hester, the unfriendly rat who later turned into a bright and interesting pet; Hannah the intelligent and precious dog, Emma the pig adorable and endearing pig, and many more. Usually with each animal, Rachel also had a man of the moment. <br /> <br />Rachel describes in loving and touching detail each of her relationships with her pets, and how each of her relationships with men fell apart. I found myself moved when her pets would pass away. The Pig and I was a delightfully warm, real, and interesting read. Animal lovers will smile with knowing and sigh with sadness at many parts. Rachel's writing style is offbeat and engaging. I found myself amazed at the way she could relate to and get along with so many different kinds of animals, and impressed with the fact that she came away from each relationship, whether it be with her pet or with a man, with knowledge about herself. <br /> <br />This was an excellent read and I know many will love it.	2005-01-22

In exchange, she will have to keep a diary detailing her every move - from picking wedding cake, to deciding on a florist, to choosing a gown. Sounds amazing, right? It is at first, but things go downhill fast. First off, Eloise's boss Astrid, who is calling all the shots, insists that she have her family at the photo shoot. The problem with that is Eloise's mother passed away years ago, and her father has always been MIA. (He took off when she was a kid.) She also hadn't spoken to her brother in some time. If that isn't bad enough, Astrid is forcing Eloise to be the \\"modern bride\\", which among other things means a canary yellow feathered wedding dress. (Yeah, you read that right.) To top everything off, Eloise is suddenly feeling as though she might be making a mistake marrying Noah. <br /> <br />Will it be the wedding disaster of the century? Or will there even be a wedding at all? Will Astrid sue her for dropping out of the wedding? <br /> <br />With a few laugh-out-loud scenes, hilarious wedding antics, and plenty of touching moments, this book is another wonderful chick lit read by a great author. Anyone that says chick lit is all fluff obviously hasn't read Melissa Senate's books - they are anything but. Her plots are solid and well-crafted, and she delves into serious subjects. The characters are so real that they nearly jump off the pages. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good Marriage/Wedding chick lit type of novel.	2005-01-12

If you are looking for a novel filled with a sharp sense of humor, witty dialogue and very interesting characters, look no further - you've found it. <br /> <br />Meet Shannon McCormick, the witty and endearing main heroine in Unbecoming Behavior. Much to the chagrin of her mother, she isn't a lawyer, but does work at a law firm catering to the every whim of the interns. Trying to evade dismissal for the \\"Unbecoming Behavior\\" that the firm often let people go for, she slugs away at her thankless job, deals with rude interns, a demanding and ridiculous boss, and the knowledge that she is disappointing her mother. Her only reprieve is Van, the funny, friendly security guard in the lobby of her company's building. Shannon knows she doesn't want to become a lawyer, as she cannot stand them, but what other options does she have? She's not happy in her job and she knows time is running out. <br /> <br />While dealing with her work issues, she is also juggling her love life. She has just broken up with long-time boyfriend Max, who can't seem to leave her alone. Then there is Noah, her brother's best friend who seems to be avoiding her; Blaine, the hot new guy in her office who seems to prefer her best friend Emma; and Van, who is supposed to only be her friend, but with whom she clearly has chemistry with. And of course there is the ever-present Max who refuses to leave her alone. <br /> <br />What's a girl to do? <br /> <br />I absolutely adored this book. With an endearing and quirky cast of characters, a plot that keeps you on your toes, and wonderful writing, it is a great chick lit read. I loved how the characters were all realistic and lifelike. Stephanie Rowe has done a fantastic job with balancing fun, romance, friendship, and career angst inthis novel. <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend this book to all chick lit fans. You will laugh, you will sigh, and you will smile while reading it. Don't even think about missing this one.	2005-01-12

After all, she was positive that her boyfriend Kieran was about to propose. Instead, Kieran ends up giving her the old heave-ho, insisting that he wanted to see other people. Clarissa is devastated, and decides to head for Antarctica with her two best friends Kate and Delilah. <br /> <br />Antarctica turns out to be not quite as easy as Clarissa had hoped. It is downright freezing, she seems to be making ridiculous mistakes, and she just wants to go home. Will things get any better for her? Will the handsome Mitch step in and welcome her with open arms? Will the three girls ever make it in such rough terrain? Find out by reading the book! <br /> <br />I'm usually intrigued with a far-fetched story line in a chick lit novel if it's done right, but unfortunately this novel didn't really leave much of a good impression. Too much detail was given to the characters, but not near enough to the story or setting. I found myself a bit bored and annoyed through most of the novel. I had been hoping for an interesting portrayal of Antarctica at the very least, but I didn't even get that. (Granted, there were some descriptions, but they weren't near enough). The characters were endearing though - I did like Clarissa and her friends. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd have to sum up this novel as being generally boring with lackluster storytelling. It certainly has a cute and eye-catching enough cover, but unfortunately what is inside doesn't measure up.	2005-01-12

The main heroine of the story is Girl (yep, that's her name). She is stuck in a job with a boss from hell and a tiny studio apartment in the city. However, her job doesn't last long - after stealing a year's worth of research from her, Girl's boss Doris fires her unceremoniously. Girl enters the desperate world of job seeking, and through a series of accidental meetings she lands a job at My Company. (Yeah, that's the name of the actual company.) Guy, her loud, obnoxious boss spends most of his time screaming obscenities into his cell phone, and doesn't exactly make clear exactly what she's supposed to do. As a result, she spends half of her time trying to figure that out, and the other half covering up her mistakes when she discovers her original assumptions were wrong. If that isn't enough, the people she is subletting her apartment from notify her that she has to move immediately, as they need to take possession of it.    However, Girl is prepared. After all, she has a potential new boyfriend (named Buster), a new salary, and a new job. What can go wrong? It doesn't matter that she has no clue what she is doing half the time, right? Girl stumbles along bravely, finds a new apartment, and puts up with her ridiculous job environment.    I enjoyed the story line and plot to this book. However, there were many pitfalls along the way. The storytelling was choppy, disjointed and confusing at times. Many times characters who weren't properly introduced into the story made an appearance, puzzling things. Moreover, Girl is annoyingly passive and acquiescent. Who puts up with that kind of abuse at work? I sure wouldn't.    Although it's obvious that the authors of Citizen Girl strive for their writing to be unusual, biting and satirical (which it is), it also ends up being convoluted and confusing. Bit if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with an interesting and sometimes funny story.However, don't expect to find an overall meaning or satisfying conclusion to it.    Overall, I recommend Citizen Girl to chick lit fans and other readers who enjoy stories about horrible bosses, glamourous jobs and living in the big city of New York. However, be prepared for some rough reading, crude language and sometimes confusing scenes. I've definitely read worse books.	2004-12-26

Just when things couldn't get any crazier, Neil, an ex-boyfriend of Laurens, comes back into her life. This time though, he's looking for a wedding cake - for his own wedding, which is planned. <br /> <br />With an original and constantly-moving plot, a subtle humor that will have you guffawing out loud more than once, and engaging characters, I was hooked on Dress Rehearsal from almost the moment I started reading. Packed with delicious cake details, author Jennifer O'Connell's keeps the plot unpredictable and highly irresistable throughout the novel. Set in the exciting city of Boston, I think readers who enjoy a spunky and intelligent main character will love this book. There is a subtle humor to this book that makes it even better. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend Dress Rehearsal, and am much looking forward to the release of O'Connell's next book.	2004-12-26

When she discovers a secret about PJ's past that can mess things up, she must make a decision: write the story of her life, and in the process ruin PJ's life, or continue on in her miserable job?    All three stories interweave together in this book to make a very engrossing, interesting and original read.  The characters were refreshingly unique and well drawn.  Set in the glamourous San Francisco Bay Area, Cathy Yardley takes the reader through the interesting world of clubs, DJ'ing, and modeling.  PJ's love of music is palpable and gives the book an interesting twist.    I loved this book and highly recommend it. The only downside of this book was that the last few chapters seemed to be a little dragged out.  However, the overall book was excellent, and I think most chick lit fans will adore it!	2004-12-26

If so, you are in good company - we all have at some point. This is also the scenario that Mona, the main character in this novel, is in. <br /> <br />When her company offers some of their employees early retirement (as a way to cut back on layoffs), Mona jumps at the chance. She takes the modest package and decides to spend her free time making over herself and getting the man of her dreams (a tax accountant named Adam). She hasn't seen or spoken to him in some time, and he barely (if at all) knows she exists, but why should that stop her? Her recently deceased grandmother (with whom Mona grew up with, since the rest of her family perished in a terrible accident in Montana when she was a young girl) had always said he would make the perfect man to marry. <br /> <br />Mona goes about changing herself with serious determination. Through a series of comic events she manages to get the help of Mike \\"The Dog\\" Dougherty, who writes a column in a men's magazine entitled \\"The Dog House.\\" Mike reluctantly agrees to help her (after she agrees to pay him). Mona's re-invention begins taking place thereafter: stripper classes, glamourous shopping trips, weight loss, and more. Will Mona get Adam, or discover she wants something more? Find out in this hilarious, endearing and sometimes touching novel. <br /> <br />This book was a pleasure to read. Mona was a somewhat misguided young woman that sometimes did things that made you wonder, but she had a way of growing on you. Jennifer Coburn did an excellent job making the story come alive with vibrant characters, an original plot, and some interesting twists and turns in the story. This novel also has real substance and charm.	2004-12-20

I found it be powerfully touching, exquisitely detailed and highly readable.   <br /> <br />Lemon, the main heroine of the book, is strong, hard-working and an excellent cook. As a matter of fact, she owns her own restaurant in NYC and is trying (so far unsuccessfully) to turn the place into something profitable. Her devoted boyfriend is dropping marriage hints, but she just doesn't have time or desire to settle down until she has made her restaurant into something spectactular. However, it soon becomes apparent that she is pregnant, but she is so busy that she doesn't realize it right away. <br /> <br />When it finally dawns on her that maybe all the symptoms are pointing to pregnancy, Lemon has mixed emotions. On one hand, her wonderful boyfriend says he plans to be there every step of the way, which is reassuring. On the other hand, she is conflicted, because the timing just stinks. However, after some heartfelt talks with her boyfriend and getting an ultrasound, she becomes fiercely attached to the little creature growing within her. <br /> <br />Things are hectic, but going along okay, when tragedy strikes. Lemon loses someone very close to her, and things begin spiraling out of control. She is forced to deal with her emotions and overcome her grief, sense of loss and feelings of abandonment. <br /> <br />I don't want to give away any more details about the plot, so I'll leave the reader to find out the rest! One of the best things about Luscious Lemon is that it enticingly goes from one scene to another flawlessly. The story starts off with a daring food and love scene, then plunges into the details of Lemon's life. The author provides a detailed background on all of the main characters in the story as well as plenty of delicious descriptions of food. As with Heather Swain's previous book Eliot's Banana, there is a small supernatural side-story. All of these details combine to make Luscious Lemon into a wonderful, vivid and detailed story. <br /> <br />Heather Swain does an amazing job in capturing the true feelings of abandonment and pain that one often experiences when they lose someone close to them.  Overall, I highly recommend this book.	2004-12-18

Are you endlessly fascinated with the British and/or the UK in general? Whether you answered yes or no to either question, you will still enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />Alexandra Brennan is the main heroine in the novel. She is living in New York City and generally bored in life. When her ex-boyfriend tells her she wouldn't be able to get into Grad School in the UK, she takes that as a challenge - and gets in.

I quickly raced down to the bookstore and grabbed a copy. What better premise can you imagine - two women decide one night (after having a few drinks) to put a list of \\"bastards\\" on the internet, only to have the list become extremely popular and get out of hand? I knew it would be good. And I was right - it was really good. <br /> <br />Gemma and Sarah have been friends forever. Along with their friendship, a list has survived over the years - a list they fondly call \\"the bastard list.\\" This list is made up of a the names of guys that had earned the name in one way or another. One night after a few too many cocktails, they decide to put the list up on the internet. Gemma not only puts up the list, but gets the word out to the virtual world about it. Before they know it, people all over the world are viewing the list, adding their own names and stories. Gemma discovers that money could be made from it, and she decides to put the list on a new website and begin advertising. The new name she comes up with is [...] She hires an assistant (a quiet, serious type of guy) and the revenues begin rolling in. <br /> <br />Gemma's friends Sarah and Michael begin expressing their concern over the website. After all, the website was supposed to be based on a list of men who had acted like bastards, not state that all men were bastards, right? Gemma seems to be especially bitter about men lately, it seems. But she has pretty good reason to, or so she thinks. <br /> <br />I absolutely adored \\"Friday Night Cocktails\\". It was outrageously fun to read, well-written and irresistable. I loved Gemma, the main character. Although she was flawed in many ways, somehow I still found myself rooting for her. Even when she went off on her \\"All men are bastards!\\" tangent. She was a woman to be reckoned with, and I really enjoy that in a main character. As for the plot, it moved along breathlessly and was well executed. And the novel was very funny! <br /> <br />Overall, this book was a highly satisfying and fun read.	2004-12-18

It's the classic, original chick lit forumla, but does it work every time? Thankfully it did this time. <br /> <br />Trina is 28 years old and just living. When she finds her sweet, computer-obsessed boyfriend is found in his living room making out with another girl, she figures it's time to move on. Trina is understandably disappointed, but decides it is time to move on. So she does. First there is the irresistable Javier, who only seems to call her once in a blue moon. Then there is Pete, the \\"guy's guy\\" who seems to be pretty interesting after all, despite his initial impression; At the same time her job is going through a \\"reorganization\\" which could either land her a promotion or the ax. When she discovers a very unpleasant ailment that one of her boyfriends apparently gave her, she has to find out who is responsible. <br /> <br />Trina decides it's time to figure out who she is, where she is going, and who she wants. <br /> <br />Overall I enjoyed White Bikini Panties. It was well-written, engaging and had some likeable characters. However, there were a couple of times that I felt the story line kind of lagged and I was waiting for something to happen. While the book is good, it isn't outstandingly great. But White Bikini Panties will charm most chick lit fans. I do recommend it to readers who enjoy reading about women trying to find her way in life, get over an ex-boyfriend, and get ahead in her job.	2004-11-28

However, this book was amazing. Not only did each character have their own distinctive voice, but the characters were hilarious, amusing, and realistic. The story line itself was absorbing and fun. <br /> <br />\\"Hit Reply\\" tells the story of many different characters in different states of their lives. There is Amber, the sarcastic yet hilarious woman living in Boston, who works at Milennia Marketing and has just reconnected with an old flame from high school. Gray, Amber's \\"old flame\\" is living in another state with another woman and her child, but is soon trading loving, tender and sweet emails and Instant Messages with Amber. Stephanie, now living in Florida, is a happily-married, stay-at-home mother of two, but lately her marriage has been on the rocks. So she accepts an outside consulting job Millenia Marketing (the same company that Amber works at). She also suspects her husband is cheating on her with a leggy beauty from his office with whom he's taken many business trips with. Tom also works for Millenia Marketing, and is married, but suddenly finds himself confessing his feelings for Stephanie via email/IM. What with the four of them emailing and IM'ing each other, sparks soon begin to fly. <br /> <br />Add in a disgruntled boss who is after Tom's job and determined to cause trouble as she does, a sweet, motherly assistant who is having a sort-of email romance with an old flame, a sudden secret that Amber is hiding from nearly everyone, and much more, you have yourself an irresistably funny story. <br /> <br />So how is it that a book of emails and instant messages can be so darn good? Well, I think it's a combination of the authorbeing able to tell a story (or as it is, many stories) and keeping the reader hooked, filling the story with memorable characters and surprising plot twists, and causing the reader to either laugh, cry, and/or get a smile on their face that just doesn't go away until hours after they've finished the book.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a book not to miss!	2004-11-28

What happens when you add in a fourth angle? Would it be considered a love square? Perhaps. In any case, this is the scenario that the characters face in Lauren Henderson's latest novel. In my opinion, there is nothing more enticing then a juicy, intriguing chick lit book filled with offbeat characters and situations.   <br /> <br />Katie and Michael have recently become an item and seem to be madly in love. The only problem is, Michael still lives across the street, and is best friends with Sally, one of his ex-girlfriends. Not only that but Sally seems to still have feelings for Michael, and enjoys flaunting her intimate knowledge of Michael's habits in Katie's face. Jude is Sally's best friend and wants nothing more than to see Sally back together with Michael, and Katie out of the picture. Meanwhile Jude is dealing with her own new workaholic boyfriend Scott, who doesn't seem to get along with her friends. For the time being, at least, Katie and Michael seem to be very much into each other and faithful. <br /> <br />But of course, life drops a bomb. As if things aren't complicated enough, Michael's first love Sofie, who had broken his heart mercilessly (from which he had never seemed to recover) comes to town. Katie discovers she is expecting Michael's baby, which throws everyone into a panic. Michael seems to be the devoted father-to-be, but is he really? Will Sofie woo him back? Will Sally woo him back? Will this complicated mess ever be solved? <br /> <br />Lauren Henderson has thrown together an irresistible recipe of romance, bad manners, jealousy and friendship in this book. The story is very unpredictable - just when you think you know what is going on, a wrench is suddenly thrown into the works to knock everything about. I enjoyed the seemingly unshakeable friendship that Sally and Jude had, the realistic relationship angst between Katie and Michael, and the angst felt among the characters.What a great story! There is a delightful amount of British wit and phrases to further spice up the story.	2004-11-28

The attraction is immediate and mutual, although Declan is supposedly seeing a famous movie star, Laura Stapleton, at the time. However, the two of them soon find themselves sending flirtatious emails back and forth, culminating in a face to face meeting, and eventually, Kyra moving to Venice, CA to be with him.  <br /> <br />Things are fine, and the two of them even end up getting married. However, Declan's movie is finally released, and it is an instant Box-Office sensation. Overnight he becomes a well-known star, and Kyra quickly finds out that being married to a famous actor isn't easy. As a matter of fact, it is downright dangerous, what with deranged fans looking in their windows, desperate women sending crazy letters, and the tabloid frenzy that examines their every move and starts spreading rumors that Declan is cheating. Will Kyra be able to handle this? Will her sudden fame help, or destroy, her budding design business? Find out by reading this well-written, absorbing novel.  <br /> <br />I've come to expect that any novel by this author will be well-written, out of the ordinary, unusual story lines that are ultimately satisfying. This book is no exception - I adored it.

Making ends barely meet as a Yoga instructor, and having her latest screenplay rejected, she has no idea her life is about to change. On the advice of one her professors at school, she begins to revise one of her earlier plays in hopes it will be made into a movie. At the same time, she meets a handsome soap star, Hank, who is definitely interested in her.  <br /> <br />When she receives the great news that she will be able to direct the play, Charlie is thrilled. Hank manages to convince her to give him the lead part, but she isn't too sure of her decision. When problems break out during the rehearsals and taping, she realizes it may not have been the best idea...  <br /> <br />Kissing in Technicolor is a solid, highly readable story featuring a very strong and admirable main character, intellectual writing and bantering that will appeal to people who appreciate that (as I do), and a satisfying story that unfolds at a leisurely pace. Jane Mendle has definitely impressed me with her intelligent and wonderful novel - and I hope she plans to write more books!  <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend Kissing in Technicolor. There was nothing about the book that I didn't like. The supporting characters were realistic and likeable, and the author keeps a good handle on the story line. The main character is one of my favorite types in chick lit - strong, slightly flawed, intelligent and realistic. At a hearty 346 pages, the novel will keep you pleasantly occupied for many hours.

Plenty, if you consider what got them all to the island in the first place!  25-year old Kelah from London is dying to become a published writer.  Maybe a beautiful island can help?  Anya from San Francisco is convinced she is cursed in love - and after almost dying from an overdose, she has a choice: check into rehab, or go on vacation with her friend's sister Parker.  Parker meanwhile has problems of her own - her husband of only 11 days has deserted her.  So she decides, after some not-so-gentle prodding from her partner at the law firm, to go on vacation to a Greek island on what was supposed to be her honeymoon.  46-year old Claire Dillon from Australia also has man problems: her husband is cheating on her with a masseuse, her gay son hasn't spoken to his father in over 7 years, and Claire decides she needs to get away before she loses her mind.    Things don't quite go the way they are supposed to for these four women.  Anya falls for a man who pined away for his ex-girlfriend, who has suddenly shown up on the island; Parker is very attracted to a man who refuses to let her be anything but a good friend; Claire finds that she still has a singing voice, and that she can have an affair with a very enigmatic singer named Andreas, who may not be as available as he seems; and Kelah discovers her best friend Boz may have more feelings for her than she ever imagined.      Join the four women in their struggle to find themselves, find peace, and perhaps find a few hunks on the tiny island of Corfu in Paging Aphrodite.  Kim Green has thrown together the perfect recipe of sun, fun, love, angst, friendship and uncertainty in this book.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, as the four main characters have a way of making you root for them.    There were many plot twists and turns in this book that really surprised me.   If you are looking for a very unpredictable novel that will keep you reading until the very end - make sure to pick up a copy of Paging Aphrodite.  You won't be disappointed.  The characterization is excellent, the plot races along breathlessly, and the story is refreshingly distinctive.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-29

Ever wonder what it would be like to have a best friend from childhood who would remain your best friend forever? Or even a group of friends? Lindsay Faith Rech's latest book explores just that possibility, and more. This is no ordinary chick lit book, I might add.  Instead, this book is a wonderful novel filled with characters that you just don't want to leave at the end, and a story that is more like an experience then just a story.     \\"Joyride\\" is told from Stella's point of view. The story begins in the present tense one night when Stella gets a phone call from her best childhood friend Emily, who now lives in Europe. Emily is all worked up and needs Stella to come out to her immediately. What the exact problem is isn't revealed to the readers yet, but it's clear that it is something that Emily has done that is bad enough to threaten their solid friendship. Stella, clearly agonized over the news given, jumps on the first flight she can find.     But since Emily lives so far away and it will take no less than three flights to get to her, Stella has plenty of time to reminisce about the past. That is where the book then goes into the past tense and explains how Stella and Emily got to be such good friends and what led up to that fateful phone call. It tells how their lives growing up were exhilarating, yet tinged with the sorrow of many losses. However, somehow they stuck together through man problems, parental issues, deaths of loved ones, and much more.     \\"Joyride\\" is a complex, rich and beautifully written book that I never imagined it would be when I picked it up to read. Author Lindsay Faith Rech is supremely talented to pull such a story together. The vibrant and realistic descriptions of friendship, love, lust, sorrow, pain, and happiness are interwoven with the threads of the plot. There is a very healthy amount of suspense in the story as well, since we have no idea what the fateful phone call is about until near the end. I tried to guess but ended upbeing wrong, which I loved. (I dislike being able to predict an ending in a book I'm reading.)     The characterization in this novel is thorough and solid, and the story and characters gripped me immediately, to an extent that I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. Some parts of this book are not completely realistic, such as the friendship and how it was portrayed in the story. However, that only adds to this book's genius. Trust me - read it and you'll see what I mean.     Overall, I highly recommend this book to absolutely everyone! My only warning to you is not to start it right before going to bed, because you will be sure to be up all night with this one.	2004-10-08

With her ex husband living in Seattle, Charlotte is just fine going about her life on her own. Although Charlotte misses her daughter Emily and is always wondering what she is doing, things are okay in her life. After all, she has her routines to occupy her time.  <br /> <br />However Emily, who now lives in New Hampshire with her boyfriend and two eccentric roommates, pays her a visit one day and both of their lives are never quite the same again. Some rather shocking news gets revealed during her visit, and both Emily and Charlotte are faced with some difficult decisions and times. What with Emily's caring boyfriend Walter, Charlotte's ex-husband Joe, the uncertain feelings between them all, and Charlotte's paranoia, things hover quickly on the edge of disaster. Will they be able to work it all out? Find out in this wonderful and moving story.  <br /> <br />I immensely enjoyed this novel for several reasons. The main thing about it was how well the author let the reader into the head of the main character. Charlotte comes across as a real, four-dimensional mother figure that you will instantly care about and root for. She has real flaws and issues, but is just so likeable somehow. This story is also very well-written with a splash of imagery thrown in. From the small condo that Charlotte occupies in New Jersey, to the woodsy house that Emily and Walter live in New Hampshire, the reader will be immersed in details so rich and real, they will be there themselves.  <br /> <br />There were some delicate subjects tackled in this book, such as abortion issues, mother-daughter angst, love, and loneliness. Elise Juska did an absolutely amazing job with it - I couldn't have asked for a better story that captured real family emotions.  <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend \\"The Hazards of Sleeping Alone\\" for anyone's reading collection, especially if you are a mother or a daughter!	2004-10-04

As is the tradition in Indian marriages, Sanjay lives with his parents, and as the wife, Priya is expected to take care of the household and try to have children. However, when it doesn't happen (the children part at least), Sanjay's parents decide Priya is to get a job. Priya is only too happy to comply, as she is tired of catering to their every whim. She can't seem to relate much to Sanjay either, with him either always at work or taking his parents' side against her.  <br /> <br />Somehow Priya manages to land a glamourous job at a major Hollywood media company, starting as a receptionist and working her way up. Soon she is leading a double life - interviewing famous movie stars, wearing revealing designer clothing, and making friends at work. Then she goes home at night (after changing into her old drab clothing) and is the perfect wife who cleans and cooks. She can't tell Sanjay because he will disapprove. And his family would be angry. SO what's a girl to do? Can she keep up the double life or will it all crumble around her in disaster?  <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"The Village Bride of Beverly Hills.\\" Once again Kavita Daswani's easy flowing, addictive and intriguing story-telling drew me in. I was able to sympathize with Priya's situation, as she was a pretty likeable character. However, I found a lot of the story to be very unrealistic and unlikely. The author also could have done a better job of researching her subject matter. However, I must say that the story was well-written enough and enjoyable that those factors didn't matter as much as they normally would. I am definitely looking forward to this author's next novel. She has a particular way with words that will keep you reading until the end.  <br /> <br />Don't miss it!  <br />	2004-09-10
US	28822725	RH51PC8ZWE1HY	0843953705	900465262	American Idle	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Completely Hilarious!!	I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which tells the story of Jules Vernon. She has just been hired to be a Production Coordinator for the reality TV show PSL (Pop Star Live.) After having been clubbed over the head with a frying pan by her previous celebrity chef boss, she is desperate for a job. When the opportunity comes up to work on PSL, she grabs it, not knowing \\"Production Coordinator\\" really means she is a glorified babysitter to a handful of Pop Star Wannabees, as well as having to cater to every whim of the production crew.  <br /> <br />Although Jules had thought it would be a great idea at first, she begins to see things are pretty insane with the show. Not only is she forced to deal with a coworker from hell, an insane producer, neurotic judges (who resemble the real judges on American Idle the TV show so closely that I suspect they were the fodder for this book), and a great assortment of other wacky people, but she ends up meeting a total hunk that seems to really like her, but for some reason keeps disappearing. Throw in a best friend who writes ad copy for a sex toy manufacturer and a father going through a mid-life crisis, and Jules's life is just going insane. But it is not without a lot of fun, and in the case of the reader, laughter.  <br /> <br />Author Alesia Holliday doesn't waste any time in this novel. She throws you immediately into the fray of Jules's crazy and insane life. Her dead-on and wry observations are a big part of what made this book so funny. The other part is the insane characters. The thing about this book that really got me was that the author was so subtle somehow with the humor. She didn't throw in ridiculous puns or go overboard, yet the book was screamingly funny.  <br /> <br />The plot took me a few short chapters to get into, but once I did, I was hooked. The overall tone of the novel was light, borderline madcap insane, but even had a few touching scenes thrown in. Jules as a main character is great - she is smart, sassy,and strong-willed. Whether she is dealing with having her personal belongings (including some sex toys her friend Kirby sent her as a gag gift) searched by airport security, the hypochondriac Roger (the judge who is just like Simon on the show American Idle) showing her what he believes to be Testicular fungus, and many other zany happenings, Jules manages to get through it.  <br /> <br />Overall I highly enjoyed American Idle and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light, absolutely hilarious, and well-written book. I can honestly say this is one of the funniest books I've ever read. It would be just as much at home in the humor section of the bookstore as well as the chick lit section. In any case, don't miss it!	2004-09-10

Mafia Chic is about Theresa \\"Teddi\\" Gallo, a 27-year old woman who just happened to have been born into one of the most notorious Mafia families of New York. She's tough as nails, has a huge, bustling Italian family that dote on her, runs her own Italian restaurant, and lives with a posh British girl named Diana whom she fondly refers to as \\"Lady Di\\". At the beginning of our story, she's determined not to be struck by the \\"thunderbolt\\" of love, as at least one of her family members has done and lived to regret. She also wants a normal life somehow, despite her assorted relatives staking out her apartment on a nightly basis, tracking her every move, and a grandfather who hands over $100 bills like candy. But how? For Teddi, it means having Lady Di distract her cousin Tony with baked goods while she sneaks out for a date with an eligible man she met one night in a club. <br /> <br />I highly enjoyed Mafia Chic for the first four chapters. It was laugh-out-loud funny in a witty, dry-humor sort of way, which I love. However, it began to pall as I got deeper into the book. As much as Orloff tries to portray Teddi's Mafia family endearingly to her readers, and does to a certain extent, it just didn't get very far with me. Especially when it became apparent that they were supposed to all be a big group of \\"softies.\\" I mean, how soft can these guys be when they have been found in the past with body parts in their freezers? And found with loads of stolen goods that just happened to fall off of a truck? What really galled me was when one of Teddi's family members made it clear that a guy was \\"Good\\" so long as he wasn't into \\"drugs and stuff like that\\". Oh yeah, drugs are so bad, but cutting various body parts of other human beings isn't? And killing for revenge? And having various relatives in prison doing life sentences for murder? I have to admit I wasn't convinced. <br /> <br />Overall I was a little disappointed with \\"Mafia Chic.\\"  It started off great and was laugh-out-loud funny at times, but as the book wore on just got a little too predictable and a little ridiculous.	2004-09-05

It's funny (downright hilarious at times), touching, absorbing and hard to put down.     Clare Spencer, main heroine of True Love and Other Lies, is a travel writer - but not the glamorous kind. She works for a magazine called \\"Sassy Seniors\\", and gets stuck traveling to places that are suitable mainly for senior citizens. Not only that, but the slightly sarcastic and witty twist she injects into the articles she writes are always being shot down by her editor. The story starts with Clare boarding a plane and getting stuck sitting next to an irate Indian woman who keeps complaining non-stop to her husband seated behind her, but the guy sitting next to the woman's husband offers to switch seats. This guy, named Jack, ends up being interesting, intelligent and nice. Needless to say, they hit it off very well and arrange to meet up during her stay in London. They spend a glorious few days together, and despite herself, Clare starts to fall for him.     However, there is a twist. (Isn't there always?) Clare discovers that Jack is her best friend Maddy's ex boyfriend, whom she is still obviously pining for. Clare, who is a very moralistic and solid person, is stuck in the middle and doesn't know what to do. She wants to confess to Maddy about her and Jack's relationship, but Maddy is so torn up about him (even seeming psychotic at times) that Clare is afraid to confess. Meanwhile Jack and Clare are becoming closer and closer.     What's a girl to do? Join Clare on her adventure through this mess of a romantic triangle. True Love and Other Lies isn't only about romance, however; Clare is trying to find a new job, as her current one is driving her crazy with boredom. She is also struggling with a lot of self-doubt and isn't sure she is ready to open herself to being hurt again.     True Love and Other Lies is a wonderful story, and I enjoyed it very much. Whitney Gaskell has created in Clare a strong,yet flawed character many will be able to identify with. She is a woman with actual morals, and has a way of looking at life that is sarcastically hilarious yet down to earth. This book made me laugh out loud more than once with the funny commentaries on airplane travel, job angst and general life happenings. (If you think you've ever been stuck sitting beside someone unpleasant on a flight or had a job interview from hell, you'll especially appreciate this book).     Definitely a unique novel, I highly recommend True Love and Other Lies. The book was a tiny bit predictable to me (especially the ending), and a couple of times I wanted to shake Clare because she was just too nice for her own good, but overall this was a great read that I had a hard time putting down. People that enjoyed Gaskell's first book \\"Pushing 30\\" will love this one, as well as others who haven't read this author before. Gaskell puts together a winning formula once again: insecure yet strong and witty woman trying to find herself, a better job and get her romantic life sorted out, with snappy dialogue and plot twists to add to the mix.	2004-09-02

Star is the name of her character in the book. Her rise to fame apparently began one day when she attended a baseball game. Somehow that baseball game turned into a photo shoot where Star was the make-up artist. Her supposed good friend Brandi was the model for the shoot, but for some reason didn't live up to the expectations of the photographer. However, Star's good friends Billy and Skip got some pictures of Star herself, much to Brandi's disgust and jealousy, and somehow those pictures ended up in the hands of Jayne Hersfield, the executive editor of Mann Magazine.     One thing led to another and Star was offered a cover shoot for Mann magazine. So she had to leave behind her childhood lover/boyfriend Adam and rural Florida where she'd been all her life and fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. And thus began her career. The rest, of course, is history. The story goes on to describe how she nearly instantly became an icon, went on to bed hop with many famous men, attend orgies, and much more.     So, just how bad was this book? I can't begin to cover all the things about it I didn't like. But I'll try. First of all, the author tries WAY too hard to show how sweet and innocent Star is before her foray into modeling. Why, the sweet country bumpkin didn't even know what \\"Check Your Baggage\\" meant, (\\"What are you checking them for?\\") or what a \\"Blimp field\\" was, (\\"You mean they grow blimps in fields??\\") or that LAX is an airport. Come ON. I GET IT ALREADY. This way over-done effort to have Star appear innocent goes on throughout the book and frankly makes Star appear to be a complete and total moron. It's as though someone hands you a piece of pie and tells you it is sweet. When you might appear to be disbelieving, the pie is then smeared in your face and shoved down your throat violently until you decide to agree that yes, it issickly sweet after all. (To the point of gagging.)     What made it hard to get through the first several chapters was the vague, choppy storytelling. There were too many characters in various scenes that weren't properly introduced into the story, making it confusing to figure out who was who. Once the story did get moving, things were a little better. However, this book, sad to say, appears to have been written by a 10 year old! There are no surprises, no skilled or enticing prose, and no solid plot (other than the recounting of what really happened in her life) to make someone continue reading. However, I continued because I knew I had to finish the book in order to review it.     After reading the first 4 chapters of the book, I began to seriously wonder who this book was marketed for. First off, there is a reversible cover which shows Pamela Anderson as close to nude as a book can get, which I discovered by accident when I removed the cover (as I usually do while reading hard-cover books.) Second, there is almost immediately a girl-on-girl love scene, which isn't the kind of thing that most women look for in a book. Third, if a guy picked up this book to read to find out about Pamela Anderson's life, they'd be bored stiff because of the girly plot. So I ask, who was this book marketed for?     Overall, it is safe to say that I did not like this book, and won't be recommending it to anyone. And I seriously doubt this book would have been published had it not been written by a celebrity.	2004-08-31

See Jane Date by Melissa Senate was the first or second book in the Red Dress Ink series that I read. I remember how excited I was to discover this new imprint from Harlequin. See Jane Date has actually remained one of my favorites from the series to this day, nearly 3 years later!  <br /> <br />Meet Jane, a 20-something-year-old gal living, dating and working in Manhattan. Having been single for a while after her last boyfriend dumped her unceremoniously, Jane is in a slight pickle: she had to find a date for her cousin's wedding, since everyone in her family was under the impression that she had a boyfriend. With both parents dead, it was understandable that Jane felt a lot of pressure in her family.  <br /> <br />After a few disastrous (but fun to read!) dates, Jane thinks she may have found the perfect man. After a few amazing dates with a doctor who suddenly stops calling though, she realizes she may be back to square one. At the same time her job has become very stressful. She is forced to edit a memoir from childhood nemesis Natasha (fondly referred to as \\"the Gnat\\" out of earshot by Jane and her friends). At the same time she is trying to placate her Aunt Ina and various cousins that everything is fine in her life.  <br /> <br />And then everything begins to crumble, and Jane begins to discover surprising new things about herself, Natasha, and her family. Will Jane begin to keep all the balls in the air that she is juggling, or will things turn into a disaster? Find out by getting yourself a copy of this funny yet surprisingly touching book.  <br /> <br />I absolutely loved See Jane Date. I feel Melissa Senate captured the angst that accompanies pleasing your family and trying to meet a decent and eligible man in the city. Jane as a character is funny, endearing and about as realistically flawed as you can get. I found myself really moved near the end of the book as a matter of fact, and not many books do that to me.  <br /> <br />Definitely a 10/10 star read, I highly recommend See Jane Date to any woman who has found herself on a date from hell, is having family and/or and work issues, is trying to better herself, or just looking for a great read with both laughs and substance. This is definitely a chick lit book not to be missed!  <br /> <br />	2004-08-30

Dee keeps seeing visions of Shaun's recent ex-boyfriend meeting a beautiful readhead.  So what does Shaun do?  Appears at the place they are supposed to meet and prevent it from taking place.  Very interesting results take place.  I enjoyed this story about letting go and moving on.  In Agony by Isabel Wolff is about Jane, an Agony Aunt with problems of her own she can't solve.  New York by Jill Davis is about a week in the life of Anne, a new employee at a glamorous magazine in New York City.

Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor is a personal memoir written by Julia Derek.  Her story begins when she moves to Washington DC from Sweden to attend Journalism School.  One day, after several fruitless searches for a decent job or way to make enough money to stay in the USA (which she had fallen in love with), she came across an ad that was seeking Egg Donors.  The ad requirements fit her nearly perfectly, so she decides to apply, not knowing much about donating eggs. <br /> <br />Although the couple turned her down, Julia was intrigued that there was such an easy way to make money.  After a few more tries that ended in disappointment, Julia gave up, and relocated to the Los Angeles area.  However, the egg donor idea stayed in the back of her mind, and it wasn't too long before yet another opportunity presented itself.  Before Julia knows it, she has signed up, and is accepted by a couple to donate her eggs. <br /> <br />Thus begins her foray into egg donation.  Julia's first egg donation was so successful that her services as a donor quickly became in high demand.  Julia moved into her own place and made what she thought was a good friend in Rosa, her representative at the donation agency she is signed up with.  There were some pretty uncomfortable side effects and downsides to the procedures, such as having to give oneself an injection of hormones, having to undergo various doctor appointments, and having to suffer side effects of taking so many hormones.  However, Julia took them in stride, and things went really well for her.  She began making more egg donations, and more money for each one.   <br /> <br />However, slowly but surely, Julia's world began crumbling.  After a particularly awful reaction to birth control pills, a failed egg donation, and her growing depression, Julia starts realizing things aren't quite what they seem and that Rosa may not be friend she claims.  After her 11th donation, Julie is so depressed that she is nearly ready to commit suicide.  What will become of her?  Will she be scarred for life?  Read Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor and find out! <br /> <br />Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor was a very intriguing and easy to read novel.  I enjoyed it immensely and was unable to put it down.  The plot moves along quickly, and Julia does a good job of drawing the reader into her life.  The book reads just like chick lit story with a first-person narrative, but has the bonus of being based on truth.  I definitely recommend Confessions of a Serial Egg Donor to all women, especially one who is considering donating her own eggs.  Julia does a good job of covering all of the possible side effects and ins and outs of the process.   <br /> <br />The only downside to the book was the ending.  The way the author ended it made me wonder if she'd really learned her lesson!!  Other than that however, this is a gem of a novel.  <br />	2004-08-30

Unfortunately since I first heard about it in June of this year, I've had quite a wait. However, the wait has paid off. Roz Bailey, author of two other hip and fun chick lit novels (\\"Girls' Night OUt\\" and \\"Party Girls\\") didn't disappoint with Retail Therapy. It's definitely a fun, satisfying novel that is not to be missed.  <br /> <br />Alana and Hailey are young, beautiful and absolutely love to shop. The two girls are roommates with very different upbringings, but get along great. Alana is from an upstanding family, whose father is a well-known judge that will probably make it into the Supreme court one day. Alana doesn't have a job in the beginning of the story, and spends most of her days doing some serious damage to her father's credit cards. Lately however, he has begun to balk at the amount of money she is throwing away on various designer clothing, furniture and accessories. Hailey, a wholesome girl from Wisconsin with a clean, good-girl image, is an actress on a soap opera who is hoping her contract will be renewed one day soon before she runs out of money. She spends her days on the set trying to stay out of the way of the Soap Opera Diva from hell, and the rest of her time hitting the designer shops with Alana.  <br /> <br />However, all good things must come to an end, right? When Alana's father puts his foot down and declares that all of Alana's credit cards will be stopped the following morning, she is thrown into a panic. She enlists the help of Hailey and goes on a major spending spree that night. Hailey meanwhile discovers she's been \\"laid off\\" from her soap opera for a while. Just when things can't get more desperate, a woman named Marcella comes along to save the day. She knows how to bargain shop and budget. The problem is, will the two major spenders be able to stop? Will Marcella help them before they end up in bankruptcy?Since both women use shopping as therapy, will the underlying issues causing the excessive behavior be discovered and dealt with?  <br /> <br />Roz Bailey has brought us another fun and hard-to-put-down novel with \\"Retail Therapy\\". Chock full of innocent yet flawed characters, outrageous shopping trips and career woes, this book is sure to please. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. There are some reality-defying moments along the way and a slightly unbelievable story line, but it somehow works.  <br /> <br />Overall I highly recommend \\"Retail Therapy\\". Shopaholics will grin with knowing, and bargain-hunters will raise their eyebrows, but most will probably enjoy this fun gem of a novel. Don't miss it! This book is a September release from Strapless Kensington. <br />	2004-08-29

To Forgive, Divine by Melissa Leedom is such a book with these qualities. Chock full of endearing characters and set in rural Texas, To Forgive, Divine is a Christian \\"Chick Lit\\" book that should not be missed.  <br /> <br />Meet Bonnie, a widowed mother of two who is a dedicated Christian. She resides in Chandler City, GA, one of those small town type of places where you run into people you know every day, everywhere you go. In the beginning of our story, she has just begun to notice Jeff Wells, the pastor of Foster Road Baptist. Jeff is also widowed with a teenage son, and has just begun to notice Bonnie. The two of them however don't have time for anything but one special kiss between them before it all comes crashing down. Clara Adkinson, the town gossip, can't stand to see the two of them get together and starts spreading nasty rumors about them. And we all know how rumors can spread like wildfire in a small town! And unfortunately Clara manages to break the two of them up before anything really starts. Jeff believes Clara, and quickly cuts things off with Bonnie, who can't believe she has already fallen for him and is crushed.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile other things are falling apart as well - a young boy who recently joined a gang breaks into the church office; a woman who has left her cheating husband joins the church, and is suddenly spotted all around town with Jeff; Bonnie can't stop running into men she wants little or nothing to do with, including a loud-mouthed, overbearing ex-flame (that she'd never gotten together with in the first place); Clara tries to have Pastor Jeff resign from the church because of false allegations; and Bonnie and Jeff can't stop running into each other even when they try, and it's the last thing they want! Will this town and congregation ever pull together? Will thisgroup of people ever learn to forgive each other? Find out in this heartwarming story.  <br /> <br />To Forgive, Divine was a wonderful book and I enjoyed it immensely. Bonnie, the main character, is a likeable woman with flaws that many can identify with. Her situation with Jeff as well as the other characters' lives kept me riveted to the book to see how it would all end. I also loved how the book wasn't sickly sweet and unrealistic. It showed the ins and outs of living a Christian life, even some of the bad things about it, such as hypocrisy and jealousy that sometimes takes place. Melissa Leedom manages to get the message of salvation through to her readers too in this delightful story.  <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend To Forgive, Divine to all readers who love a romantic and down-to-earth story that will tug at your heartstrings. People with a Christian background will especially like it. Do you think that a true, simple and pure love doesn't exist? Read this book - it may change your mind!  <br /> <br />	2004-08-18

She is a world-traveling culinary writer currently visiting Italy for an article, when she gets a phone call from her younger sister Skye back in Minnesota. It seems Skye has gotten herself into trouble once again and desperately wants Faith to come home. (Home as in Minnesota, not Los Angeles). Skye's husband has left her, she is pregnant, and the bar that they co-own is in financial trouble. Faith at first is adamant about not wanting to go home for various reasons, but after a couple of terse phone calls (one from Faith's own ex, who can't stand her but really thinks she needs to get back to Minnesota to help her sister), Faith gives in. Upon returning to Los Angeles, she packs her stuff up and takes a road trip to Minnesota.  <br />  <br /> Thus begins Faith's adventure. She vows to save her sister, save the bar, and reconcile with (or just avoid entirely) her ex-boyfriend Flynn. But of course things don't quite go the way she plans. Her ex, who had proposed to Faith before she'd fled town with another guy ten years previously, seems to not be able to take being in the same room with her. Her scatter-brained yet lovable sister Skye is desperate to get her life together, but can't seem to pick a decent guy or show up for work on time. Worse yet, certain financial circumstances force Faith and Flynn to spend a lot of time together. When it becomes apparent that there is still a lot of sparks between herself and Flynn, Faith realizes she must come to terms with why she ran off in the first place, and whether she still has feelings for him. (Feelings other than physical, that is!) Will she be able to find herself, help her sister, and save the bar from financial ruin? Will her sister get her act together? These and many other questions will be answered when you read this book.  <br />  <br /> &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; mixes together a perfect recipe of romantic suspense, sisterly love, friendship, exciting plot twists, and wonderfully flawed characters for a delightful read. The main character Faith is very funny and real, and I often found myself laughing out loud at some of the things she says. The other characters, while all possessing various flaws, come across as very likeable and realistic. You'll find yourself rooting for them even through all of the mistakes they make!  <br />  <br /> The plot of &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; was flawlessly executed, stubbornly holding my attention until the very end. Pretty much from page one, things start happening at a fast pace. Beth Kendrick does an excellent job at both keeping the reader informed about what happened in the characters' pasts, and moving things along in the present.  <br />  <br /> Many readers will be able to identify with the main character, because she is just so down-to-earth and funny.  <br />  <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who loves a good story. (Just don't start it before going to bed or you'll be up all night!)	2004-08-05

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Another Winner from Stephanie Lehmann	Are You in the Mood is the August release from Strapless Kensington, an imprint of Kensington Books that publishes chick lit. Most of the books published under this imprint are breezy and light. However, &quot;Are You in the Mood&quot; breaks the mold a bit. It is neither breezy nor light, but instead thought-provoking, real, and compelling. And somehow, it is still chick lit. And I absolutely loved it! <br />  <br /> Camille, heroine of the book, is a 30-something-year-old actress working off Broadway, living in NYC and trying to get her big break. She lives on her own in a tiny apartment, and is doing fine, but somehow knows that her life isn't complete. She has just met a new guy named Daniel, a responsible, caring man, if a little on the boring side. Camille thinks she is happy with him, but not exceedingly so.  <br />  <br /> One night, an important critic from the NY Times sits in the audience of the play she is currently acting in. To her great surprise and delight, he ends up giving her a rave review, which Camille is certain will skyrocket her career into fame and fortune. She somehow knows everything will go well for her from now on. Daniel, however, acts as though he isn't so thrilled, and Camille decides that he perhaps he isn't the right man for her after all. After all, now that she is finally making it, she won't have time for him!  <br />  <br /> But unfortunately, things don't quite happen the way they are supposed to. The rave review doesn't open any doors for her; Her best friend Lisa declares she is going to settle down with a man who doesn't make her extremely happy, but is rich, and willing; an agent Camille has just signed on with turns out to be a total slimeball; and worst of all, Camille discovers she is pregnant, which could ruin her career. What's a girl to do in this situation? Camille must make a choice. Will it involve settling down with Daniel and raising their child, gaining the security she craves, but not the excitement? How will she deal with her acting career? And just how hard is it to raise a child these days? What will happen when she runs into a famous actor/director that she's always wanted to work for, (and has a huge crush on) who doesn't know she's married with a child?  <br />  <br /> This book was absolutely amazing and I couldn't put it down. Overall, I highly recommend Are You in the Mood to everyone, especially those who love reading about motherhood, friendship issues, and women trying to keep their careers afloat.	2004-07-30

A year older, a year wiser (perhaps), this time with a steady boyfriend in tow, Emma writes down what she's accomplished in the past year, and makes some goals for her next year of life. These goals include moving her relationship with boyfriend Jack into the next phase, purchasing more Manolo Blahniks, and moving on in her career. Emma is still the sweet, somewhat scatty, obsessive-compulsive person she was in the last book, but seems to have developed a little more of a backbone. Many of the characters from &quot;32AA&quot; are also in Call Waiting, and they are all going through different things. Rachel, Emma's outspoken, genius friend has just discovered she is pregnant, much to her chagrin. Tish is itching to drag Rufus down the aisle before his mother sets him up with someone else. Katy, married-but-not-necessarily-happy, has just gotten promoted while her husband can't seem to find a job to save his life. Many other familiar colorful characters also make appearances throughout the story.  <br />  <br /> This time around, Emma has some different issues to contend with. For instance, boyfriend Jack keeps taking off on business trips with his beautiful boss Clare and not calling Emma to let her know when he will return. Emma's eccentric Aunt Alice has passed away, leaving Emma an inheritance, but before she can get it, she has to fulfill certain unclear requirements. At the same time, Emma's job is going down the tubes. She is downgraded to a telemarketers, of all things. (Emma is known for despising telemarketers and in fact has many ingenious ways to get rid of them when they call her!) Last but not least, the beautiful Clare seems determined to not only steal Jack, but also all of Emma's friends.  <br />  <br /> Will Emma's next year of life be as difficult as her previous one was? Will Clare succeed at stealing Jack from Emma? Will Emma ever figure out what she hasto do (and how) to get her inheritance? Find out these answers, and much more, by reading Call Waiting.  <br />  <br /> I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The characters are all interesting and quirky. Emma is funny and endearing, and seems a little like an American version of Becky Bloomwood, sans the shopping habit. Her friend Rachel, whose rather colorful language made me laugh a lot in the first book, is a little more subdued this time around, but still pretty feisty. The story moves along fairly rapidly and is definitely not predictable. Also, since Call Waiting is told in first-person narrative, kind of in a loose diary format, I felt as though I was right there with Emma, experiencing everything with her and her friends.  <br />  <br /> The only thing about Call Waiting that I didn't like was the many story lines that were taking place all at once. There are at least 4 sub-plots in this book, and a couple of them seem pointless. Emma herself is going through so many different things, and with all the side stories added in, the book seemed to pull in too many directions. It was a little hard for me to keep track of. You will definitely have to stay on your toes while reading Call Waiting.  <br />  <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this book, and recommend it for fun and breezy summer reading. The novel doesn't have much substance, but all the same it is enjoyable and funny with a cast of original characters. Emma herself has grown up a little (but not too much, thankfully!), and many will be able to relate with her many dilemmas in this book.  <br />  <br /> I certainly hope there is a third book in the series!  <br />  <br />	2004-07-21

Meet Deirdre, Juliette, Anne and Lisa. At the beginning of the story, they all seem content in their lives, but it quickly becomes revealed that dis-satisfaction is lurking in the shadows for each of them, and all for different reasons. Deirdre wants to go back to her singing career, and she wants passion, which she doesn't get with her husband Paul. Juliette wants another baby, but her husband Cooper doesn't seem too thrilled with the idea. Anne discovers her husband is cheating on her, and as much as he is trying to win her back, she isn't so sure that it's what she wants anymore. And Lisa? Well, this perfectionist mother of four is definitely hiding something from everyone. But what? <br />Join these four women, and their hopes, dreams, disappointments and surprises in &quot;Babes in Captivity&quot;. The story explores four women's lives and how they are all tied down in some way to their current lives (hence the title of the book), and what they do to try and removes those binds.  This book is not predictable or boring in any way, and it is both tender, hopeful, funny and engaging all at once. It's a solid good read that will be enjoyed by many! <br />&quot;Babes in Captivity&quot; is Pamela Redmond Satran's second book. I found this novel a very intriguing character study and was drawn into the story pretty quickly, despite having started it while sitting in a busy and crowded room at my car dealer waiting for my car to be fixed. Once you get to know each of the characters, which is a little difficult at first because there are quite a few of them, you'll feel as though these are women you know. Satran does a great job of not only telling a compelling story for each of the characters, but also letting you see into their lives. I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Babes in Captivity&quot;. <br />I highly recommend this book to all women, especially married women with families,as they will really be able to commiserate with the characters. However, even I as a single and childless woman was able to greatly enjoy this book. This is a bit more of a serious chick lit novel, and not light and fluffy in any way. &quot;Babes in Captivity&quot; is a Downtown Press July release.  Don't miss it!	2004-07-11

As soon as you open this book, you will see that Vivian has mastered the art of story-telling, as well as drawing her readers into her multi-faceted and fascinating life.  This is not your ordinary chick lit book; Vivian welcomes you into her life and invites you to see all sides of her, including the bad ones.  As in her previous two books, &quot;Vivian, The V Spot&quot; is detailed yet fun, sad yet uplifting, touching, and hard to put down.  (For me, impossible).  <br />In this novel, she continues her life story, starting from when she had completed her first manuscript (for her first book) and is about to drop it off at her agent's office.  (I recommend new readers of the Vivian books start with her first one - &quot;Autobiography of Vivian&quot; or they might be confused).  A lot of things are happening in Vivian's life: her best friend is about to get engaged to a guy that doesn't seem to like Vivian; her next book is due in six months; she misses Jack terribly, although she finds out he has moved on (to a slimmer, prettier model); she finds out her book might be optioned into a television show; and much more.  Through it all, Vivian keeps up her witty, honest, best-girlfriend type of tone with the reader.<br />I found &quot;Vivian, The V Spot&quot; absolutely impossible to put down because I had to keep reading to find out what would happen next.  People who have followed her website and read her two other books will love this one.  The best thing about this book is how wide open Vivian lays her life; she has incredible courage to do it.  Although at times it seems her life is too exciting, too perfect, or too full of drama, something else usually happens to destroy the fascade.  She is real.  And this last book is extremely touching.    <br />The only problems with the book I found was possible inconsistancy with one of her previous books.  She swears up and down that she has never slept with a guy on the first date in this third novel, yet I distinctly remember her doing it also in her first book.  (Am I wrong?)  I also found a glaring typo on one page.  However, these things are very small and in no way take away from this great book.<br />Overall, I highly recommend &quot;Vivian, The V Spot&quot; to all Vivian fans, chick lit readers, and anyone looking for a touching, true-to-life story.	2004-06-29

Meet Elle Medina, a twenty-something year-old girl who has just been dumped by her fiancé and is left to pick up the pieces of her life. Not only did her fiancé dump her, but he actually married someone else while on a business trip to Iowa, mere weeks before their wedding! <br />&quot;Tales of a Drama Queen&quot; is written by Lee Nichols, and is one of the July Red Dress Ink books. This chick lit novel seems to be geared towards the younger, single gal, although I believe anyone can enjoy this story. Lately there have been so many chick lit books about married women and/or mothers. I can understand that chick lit is &quot;growing up&quot;, but I'm glad that there are still authors penning younger, single-girl books. <br />At the beginning of the story, Elle has just moved in with her good friend Maya (who lives with her Perfect Boyfriend Brad) in Santa Barbara, CA. After the requisite few days lying around feeling sorry for herself and watching endless hours of TV, she makes a to-do list. She must: find an affordable car, find a decent job, find her own place, and get her head (and life) together. Add in a new boyfriend and she'd be thrilled. However, things just don't seem to go very well for Elle. She gets fired within a week at her new job; not long after moving into a tiny new place, gets evicted because of an unfortunate accident involving water-filled condoms; has a couple of embarrassing mishaps in front of the guy she'd like to date; and much more. It is one disaster after another for Elle. Will she ever be able to find something tangible and get her life together? Or is she destined to become a failure? <br />&quot;Tales of a Drama Queen&quot; is a fast-moving, well-written book that many women will be able to identify with. The main character Elle is one of those types that despite all her wrongdoings and mistakes, comes across as someone you'd want to know. Somehow she retains her aura of innocence eventhrough all of the mayhem that ensues due to her mishaps. She is also a very real character that jumps off of the page with her vibrancy. I found myself unable to put this book down, because I had to keep reading to find out what would happen to Elle next! <br />The supporting characters in &quot;Tales of a Drama Queen&quot; were very well crafted and defined. Lee Nichols definitely has a great talent for characterization. This book is also very funny, so beware of reading it in public (unless you don't mind howling with laughter from time to time wherever you may be!) <br />As for the downfalls of &quot;Tales of a Drama Queen&quot;, I really can't say I found anything worth mentioning. Unlike many chick lit books, this one wasn't predictable in the least. Some readers will undoubtedly be put off by Elle's many mistakes and flaws though. I definitely wasn't, however. I feel the book was true-to-life because whenever the character made a mistake, (intentional or not), disastrous results would usually follow, and isn't life like that usually? It is for me at least! <br />Lee Nichols is definitely a new voice in chick lit to take notice of. Make sure not to miss this book!	2004-06-29

And for the man who dumped you to also be your boss at work, as well as the man you live with?  Disasterous and humiliating, these are the circumstances that Emma Taylor is going through when we meet her in &quot;32AA&quot;.  Things are really looking down for her.  After Adam dumps her, she is unfortunately stuck working for him since he blocks her transfer to another department at work.  (She manages to get in her little digs though, which are very amusing).  She must also vacate his apartment and find a new place, which is extremely difficult to do in the NY/NJ area.  Her well-meaning friends end up setting her up on a couple of disastrous dates, further complicating Emma's life.  And handsome, enigmatic Jack seems out of reach.  Will things ever get better for her?<br />Very funny at times with witty dialogue between the characters, &quot;32AA&quot; is a great book that will be enjoyed by many chick lit fans.  As for characterization, Michelle Cunnah does an excellent job at creating wonderful and likeable characters.  Emma herself is no idiotic chick lit heroine that you want to strangle.  Despite making some mistakes, she comes across as a strong woman with a mind of her own.  Rachel, Emma's brainiac friend, was one of my favorites in this book.  Some of the things she says are just hilarious.  <br />I also enjoyed the way this book was told in first-person narrative.  The reader will definitely get to know Emma and her friends, as well as enjoy the ride through the ups and downs of their lives.<br />I highly recommend &quot;32AA&quot; to any reader.  This is a fun, well-written debut novel from author Michelle Cunnah that should not be missed!	2004-06-28

Are you looking for a modern, \\"feel-good\\" way to understand and accept the world for what it is? Do you feel like you should be spiritual yet don't want to adhere to the old-fashioned customs and beliefs of religion? Do you want to get the most out of life and \\"living\\" that you possibly can? If you answered yes to any of those questions, \\"The Spiritual Chicks Question Everything: Learn to Risk, Release, and Soar\\" is most likely the book for you. <br />\\"The Spiritual Chicks Question Everything\\" is written by Tami Coyne and Karen Weissman, two self-proclaimed \\"Spiritual Chicks.\\" They are two sorts of different people-Tami is a passionate and highly motivated woman, while Karen is analytical and tends to think about things a lot more. The two of them, however, are very good friends and tend to think of spirituality the same way: that it's an awareness that we are connected to in Life and Living in a special way, and that Spirituality is a mindset that allows one to participate in life and realize that one has everything they need in this world to succeed. <br />That is how the idea for this book was conceived. This book is packed full of questions and answers (sixty to be exact) and real-life essays that are thrown in here or there to further explain the answer to certain questions. Here are some examples of questions asked throughout this book: Do I need to go to church to be spiritual? Am I doomed because of bad karma? Do I need God's approval to do certain things? Do I need to suffer? Is there sex after death? There are also personal essays which one or the other of the authors write to further drive a point or answer home. <br />\\"The Spiritual Chicks Question Everything\\" is written in an easily-understandable fashion and is short enough that most people will be able to finish it. It is 204 pages long, and is a little blue paperback book that can be carried most anywhere. <br />Tami and Karen convey effectively the concept that Spirituality is just living life to the fullest, not analyzing every little thing, and that we truly live in \\"heaven\\" here, that we have all the necessary tools right here on earth and within us to live happy, fulfilling lives. This book teaches that most of the old stodgy beliefs of century-old religions don't need to be taken seriously in all their aspects in order for one to gain true meaning and happiness in life. However, God is not completely thrown out in this book; many times the bible is referenced, or God is talked about in certain ways that shows that the authors do in fact believe in God, but just have different beliefs and understandings of Him. <br />Interesting though some of the concepts are, I did not find this book very helpful in my own quest for spirituality. For the most part, it seems these authors are taking what they want out of different religions (particularly Christianity and Buddism) and applying it like a thin veneer of faith to their own beliefs of spirituality. Sure, we are all spiritual beings and should live life to its fullest potential and not constantly worry. Had the book only gone that far, it would be difficult to argue with it, but many of the questions and answers and essays seemed to tell us to \\"Live for yourself\\" and \\"Don't worry about what age-old beliefs and customs and religions say; do what you feel is right and good.\\" However, that may be just me; I'm a down-to-earth girl who was raised in Christianity and still believe it to this day (and always will). <br />Which brings me to wonder, who will like this book? Who will truly benefit from this book? What messages are its authors are trying to get across? Born-again Christians and Atheists most likely will not agree with this book, Christians because of the many times the authors change something from the bible and basically throw out many of the age-old beliefs and truths of Christianity, and atheists won't because of its many references to \\"God\\" and an \\"All-Powerful One.\\" Buddhists might because this bookdoes actually reflect many beliefs and thoughts of Buddhism. For people who are not religious in any way or are undecided, The \\"Spiritual Chicks Question Everything\\" might be a good tool for them to begin to get in touch with spirituality and living life to its fullest. It seemed to me that the authors used a \\"pick-and-choose\\" method and took what they wanted from whatever religion, and used it as the foundation for their own beliefs of Spirituality. Which many will find no problems with. I did to some extent, however. <br />Don't get me wrong-I liked some of the ideas presented in the book. Particularly that we should live life to its fullest, not judge each other, and that we should treat others in a reflection of a way we wish to be treated. Pretty classic semi-religious stuff, isn't it? This book does offer some very good advice and questions/answers and explanations about general ways we can live in fulfillment of our desires. The authors many times reference Spirituality as Power, and that we can embrace Power in our day to day lives for a more fulfilling life. I did like the many positive things and ideas that the book presented and explained. <br />Overall, If you're looking for a book that answers many questions about Spirituality, want a better perspective of living life to its fullest, and want to see how you can perceive the world as all you need to succeed in life, pick up a copy of this book. It does contain some thought-provoking material that can be enjoyed and appreciated by most. Are you wondering what Spirituality is, and would you like to know how you can use it in your life? Read this. Are you looking for something deep and sacred that will give you the meaning of life? Skip this one; you will probably be disappointed.	2004-06-11

I went into reading this book knowing it wouldn't be a deep or meaningful read.  And I was right- it wasn't.  However, it was well-written and fun.  <br />&quot;Bergdorf Blondes&quot; is written by Plum Sykes, who coincidentally has a few of the characteristics as the main protagonist of her book does, such as being a columnist for a fashion magazine. Our main character, who never reveals her name in the book, is described in gossip magazines (when she's lucky enough to get in them) as a &quot;champagne bubble about town&quot;. She has WASP parents who live in England and want her to marry the Earl's son next door, and a &quot;department store heiress&quot; for a best friend, Julie Bergdorf. <br />The main character takes us through the every-day lives of what it is like to be a &quot;Park Avenue Princess&quot; and to spend your time in search of the perfect, most expensive jewelry you can afford, the perfect, richest man, the perfect, white-blond hair color that is only achieved when you visit the Bergdorf stylists (hence the title of the book), and more. Some questions, which you might be asking yourself now, are answered as you read the book. Such as, What is it like to be best friends with an heiress? Why would a department-store heiress steal from her own store? Just how does one get invited to a Chanel sample sale? Should you talk to a person if they are in last-season's Manolo Blahniks? The horror! What does a Park Avenue Princess do when she's been dumped by her fiance? What should one do if stranded in France for missing their married boyfriend's private jet? I assure that these questions, and many more, will be answered when you read Bergdorf Blondes. The characters, although about as shallow as a drying puddle of water, are funny and interesting and go through the not-so-typical ups and downs. The story revolves around Julie Bergdorf's life almost more than it does the main character's.<br />Overall, reading this book is a nice way to escape.  People who love fashion should really enjoy it as well, since there is a lot of name dropping of famous designers.	2004-06-10

It has never been so true as it was with this book. Because \\"Thoughts While Having Sex\\" ended up not only completely surprising me with its warmth, honesty and raw emotion, but actually helped me to see things about myself that I didn't realize. I'm still amazed that a chick-lit type of book had such an effect on me.<br />\\"Thoughts While Having Sex\\" tells the story of Jennifer Ward, a 25-year old playwright living in New York City. It all begins after Jennifer has written a play and submitted it to a theater in Chelsea. The play, entitled \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", is about two sisters, one who commits suicide and the other who is left behind and feels as though her dead sister is haunting her. After receiving the good news a couple of months later that the play will be produced, Jennifer throws herself into the casting and production process. Things aren't easy, but luckily the production manager Peter is sexy, smart and above all, nice. Sparks, although reluctant on Jennifer's part, seem to be flying between them. But everything changes when Kelly Cavanna joins the cast. Kelly is the complete opposite of Jennifer - she's beautiful, outgoing, and outspoken. She's also razor sharp, suspecting that Jennifer's play is based on something that really happened. Unfortunately, she's right. Jennifer's sister Diana did commit suicide, the night after they had had a terrible argument. <br />But Jennifer doesn't like admitting it, so she closes up her emotions and won't allow herself to really feel anything. She had been that way since her sister's death and probably would have gone on being that way forever had it not been for Kelly. Kelly decides it's time to bring Jennifer out of her shell. She ends up doing some pretty shocking things that threaten the outcome of the play and their uneasy friendship. At the same time, there seems to be something between Peter and Jennifer, but also Kelly and Peter. <br />Thisbook is a wonderfully warm and sometimes painfully honest story that was an absolute delight to read. It is very well written with a prose that is both easy to read and suspenseful. While the book does touch briefly on the topic of sex, it is nowhere near to the degree that the racy cover and title suggests. The story explores various themes such as opening up, guilt over the death of a loved one (when the last words you exchanged with them were hateful or angry), friendship, love, lust and more. Don't miss it!	2004-06-07

I was excited when &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; came out. Somehow I knew that it would be as good as the Shopaholic series. And I was right! It was a fantastically funny and touching read.<br />The main character, Emma Corrigan, is your normal 25-year old and somewhat-insecure woman. She is trying to get a promotion at work, has a fantastic boyfriend, and is very happy with life, or so she thinks. On an extremely turbulent flight back from a business trip from Glasgow, Emma's secrets unwillingly spill out to a total stranger next to her. She ends up telling this handsome American stranger nearly every secret she has, and then some. When the plane lands, she is embarrassed but figures she'll never see him again.<br />When this American stranger ends up being the owner at her job, Emma is mortified and determined to act like nothing happened. But Jack, the American stranger, has other ideas. Emma seems to have touched him in some way. And Emma, who thought she was totally happy with her perfect boyfriend, starts to wonder. <br />I recommend everyone to read &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; by Sophie Kinsella. It will keep you turning page after page until you finish it; Emma is a delightfully imperfect heroine that many can identify with. Make sure not to miss this fantastic book! Now if Sophie Kinsella can just write books faster...	2004-06-07
US	28822725	R1AKRGMHZBM4Y0	0425194221	308847100	Diary of a Working Girl	Books	2	6	12	N	N	Fun, But Seriously Shallow and Unrealistic	&quot;Diary of a Working Girl&quot; had a very promising beginning, but after a while things just got ridiculous.  The book tells the story of Lane Silverman, a recently-dumped-by-her-boyfriend, twenty-something year-old who lives in New York City, and writes magazine articles for no-name and little known publications. At the beginning of the book, Lane is trying to break into a big-name magazine, but keeps getting rejected. That is, until suddenly she stumbles upon the perfect idea for an article, which is approved by the Editor-in-Chief at Cosmopolitan magazine. The article idea is to explore love in the workplace. Lane must somehow land an office job and a new man within 2 months. And keep a diary about it.<br />Sounds like a great idea for a story, right? It lays the foundation for an exciting book detailing the struggle of getting and keeping a new job and man, right? Of course it does. However, sadly enough, this is where &quot;Diary of a Working Girl&quot; begins speeding downhill at an alarming rate. For the rest of the book fails to deliver anything solid or realistic, or even interesting. The book also contains an awful lot of speculation and rambling that failed to keep my attention for long.<br />I found most of the story ridiculous and the main character self-absorbed and shallow. Things were just too good-to-be-true, and I couldn't once sympathize with Lane. I seriously wonder what this book was written for? Where is the suspense? I do admit in the beginning of the book, it appeared the story would be interesting with Lane having trouble thinking of great article ideas and having editors turn them down, but it didn't last long. <br />Overall I was disappointed, because even though the book is fiction, it should have something realistic and plausible in it.  But it doesn't.	2004-06-06

Firstly, the author assumes you don't even know how to turn on a computer.  Who would be bothering to learn about JavaScript if they don't even know how to power up a PC?  Come on!  The author should spend less time detailing the basic boot up process on the PC and how to open your text editor, and more time explaining the way JavaScript works, and how it depends on the browser that the person visiting your website is using to work correctly.  Also, a lot of the examples given in this book don't work.  (Unfortunately, I've found that is common with JavaScript books.)  Also, the book seems to waste a lot of time going on and on about useless nonsense.  I know it's a &quot;dummies&quot; book, but this book expects its readers to truly be morons.<br />I'm only thankful I purchased the book at a discount bookstore for only $3.99.	2004-05-06

Gardner's debut novel A Year of Samantha. A Year of Samantha tells the story of 27-year old Samantha Van Holt, an assistant manager in a clothing store who is currently undergoing a somewhat chaotic year of her life. Who knew 27 could be such a difficult age? Fortunately (or is it?) she has plenty of male admirers to choose from - there is the very married Gordon, and the sweet, marriage and commitment enthusiast Cedric, and the night janitor who Samantha suddenly finds exceedingly attractive. While trying to figure out her love life, Samantha's boss Guido appears to be up to a no good embezzling scheme that might get everyone (including her) in trouble. Add to that the usual family chaos and problems, and you have a recipe for a pretty difficult year of life, but the makings of a solid novel.<br />This book is slightly different than some of the other more fluffy and airy chick lit. It has real substance and is delightfully realistic.  It will also keep you reading into the night to see what happens next!  I highly recommend &quot;A Year of Samantha&quot;.	2004-02-15

Not only do some of the scripts not work, but the way Perl is explained in this book, it just doesn't make enough sense.  I learned more from online tutorials that were perhaps 3 pages long than I learned in 15 pages of one chapter of this book.  I usually pick things up quite easily, so it must be the book that is confusing.<br />At least two of the script examples given in Chapters 1-8 had typos in them, and not enough explanation for someone that doesn't know much to figure out what.  I am unfortunately going to have to give up on this book to learn Perl and turn to the internet... too bad I spent $35 for the book.  I don't recommend this book to anyone except perhaps someone that already knows Perl.	2003-10-27

The main heroine, Evelyn Mays, has just been proposed to by her boyfriend, and although she says &quot;yes&quot;, her life is suddenly thrown into a confusing chaotic mess.  Evelyn decides she wants to be a glamorous, perfect size 8 bride, and joins a gym.  However, nothing seems to go right for her.  She spends too much money, flirts with her personal trainer, and grows more and more distant from her fiance.  Not only that but she just can't seem to find the strength to hold onto her fast-sinking job.  <br />Jackie Rose did a great job of introducing a totally believable character in Evelyn.  Evelyn is so perfectly imperfect and disorganized that the reader will just love her and be able to empathize greatly with her!  One will be unable to put this book down.  This is definitely one of the best Red Dress Ink books out there.	2003-07-20
US	28822725	R3LFFXI9NSP0MB	0373250126	471365971	Milkrun	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A fun book about drinks, dates and getting over your ex!	What would you do if your boyfriend dumped you via email and tells you he wants to see other people while he's backpacking around Thailand?  When Jackie Norris, heroine of &quot;Milkrun&quot; by Sarah Mlynowski, gets an email like this from her boyfriend Jeremy, she decides she will go out and date every eligible man in Boston to forget about him.  <br />Readers will be follow along breathlessly as Jackie dates, goes out to trendy Martini bars with her friends, makes new guy friends, and learns about her life and what she wants out of it.  I was amazed at how straight-out and honest Jackie was; this book is told in first-person narrative and holds nothing back.  <br />I highly recommend &quot;Milkrun&quot; if you are a single women - you'll love it!	2003-07-20
