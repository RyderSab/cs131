Characters that could have been eccentric stereotypes are anything BUT in this charming novel about a curmudgeonly scholar and his quest for love despite a nervous affectation that will have you rolling off the bed.

(After readng the farting babysitter story I called at least three people and read it aloud to them, although I never made it through the passage without breaking up.) But it's not just his past that he writes about, it's about the guts of a writer, how they work, what works for him.  What might work for you.<br />This is a three course meal.  You get a glimpse into his early years, a healthy portion of easily digestible writing advice, and a reflection on a writer's life, including his recovery from a horrible accident that left him in agonizing pain.  <br />Have you ever consumed a satisfying dish and afterwards wondered, &quot;What was that seasoning?&quot;  You can't quite place it, although it is familiar.  (I could have said vaguely familiar but after reading this book I have become an adverb nazi).  Well, I finally figured out what it was.  Sprinkled throughout the book, Stephen King makes references to his wonderful wife Tabitha, who has supported him in a multitude of ways (including an alcohol and drug addiction intervention) throughout his writing history.  She is the main ingredient in his success.  It has been her unwavering love and belief in him that has given Stephen King a reason to keep writing.  <br />Thank goodness for the ones who believe in those who dare to call themselves writers. Thank goodness for us that Stephen King found Tabitha.	2001-01-14

It is as intense in its guided exercises as Progoff's, but the format is  much less structured and much more creative. The book first offers an  in-depth look at the psychology of journaling and then is divided into four  &quot;quarters&quot; of the year.  Each week you are offered a thematic  writing exercises and six extensions of that assignment to fill out the  week. There are also exercises for special occasions/holidays and a  bibliography of books and resources. I can't wait to get started in my new  favorite writing book (plan on filling up several spiral notebooks to go  along with this one.)	2000-08-03

Told from  alternating points of view of the wife and daughters, you come to hope for  their physical and emotional survival in spite of their minister  father/husband who refuses to move out when dangers closes in.  A literary  masterpiece of finely woven history and the human psyche.  The only thing I  would have changed was to end it when the story ended.

Sensing this from his family and many of his acquaintances, the author did  his best to stifle the weight of his loss(es) and &quot;act normal.&quot;   Fortunately, for him and for us, what comes naturally, what is normal, is  to pour one's heart out onto the page.  A page doesn't judge your feelings.   A page absorbs the the grief, the anger, the frustration.  It just  listens.<br />I encourage you to listen to the pages in Three Cats, Two Dogs.   If you are quiet, you will hear the purring, you will see the talking  dog-eyes, you will smell the smoke, you will taste the tears shared by this  couple when only they could understand how it was to lose five of their  best friends, and you feel the not only the weight of that loss, but the  celebration of each animal's life as well as the joy in gradually  re-opening their scarred hearts to animals in need.<br />I read this book in  two parts, and I'm glad I did.  It gave me the chance to absorb the  feelings of loss, confusion, fear, emptiness and sudden change.  It  reminded me of how precious each moment is.  In the second half, I found  myself rejoicing in the healing and the eventual footfalls of new paws, new  friends, and a renewed spirit of animal advocacy.<br />An inspirational,  honest, and boundless telling of a story certain to touch you for a long  time.	2000-05-16
