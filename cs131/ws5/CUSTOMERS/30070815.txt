This is a restful collection, a delight at the end of a wearing day, and an intimate glimpse into the heart of the author. Fun and light-hearted, it is sometimes lilting, sometimes sober, and sometimes sparkling - yet always uplifting.<br />Many of these works are the kind the ear longs to hear in the author's own voice, to catch the inflections and listen to the body-language. Though simple and straight-forward, they have more depth than a first quick reading can reveal.	2005-08-28

It is hard to fake a come-back from great adversity. It is hard to fake a positive attitude when you have to relearn a sense of balance in an area where you were ranked among the best in the world.<br />There is a unique richness and honesty to a 14 year old's writing style. Bravo to the professional writers who worked with Bethany to polish this work, yet kept it hers. That is a difficult challenge, met and surmounted in this warm-hearted book. From the eye-catching cover design to the text to the photographs, this is a winner<br />Bravo from a Grandpa who has never been on a surfboard and whose closest encounters with sharks have been through aquarium glass, but who found this work fresh and rewarding, upbeat and honest.	2005-08-28

Aptly named, Obsessed will grab your imagination and not let go. Psychological thrillers are rarely my cup of tea, so I resisted this one for a long time. It is brilliant, breathtaking, and paced at a sprint from start to finish. It is hard to put a finger on any one strength. If there are weaknesses, the principal ones may be that the pacing never lets up - and the ending is almost too perfect (for this reviewer's taste) - yet I was consumed (obsessed?) by the need to reach that ending. The adrenaline pumping pace held competition with the desire to take in every word - the urgency to skim and so keep up with the narrative held competition with the brilliant writing that held too many gems to rush past.<br /><br />As a writer myself I am always searching for that elusive quality that raises one work above the crowd. Ted Dekker has captured that quality in Obsessed.	2005-08-28

A fun and entertaining read, the message is unobtrusive, but so integral to the story that you ache for a closer relationship with Palidan and his Father, Wulder.<br /><br />It is a very rare talent to stimulate that hunger for a closer relationship with virtually no churchy language or theological jargon. It is rarer still to do so with simple language showing gripping and imaginative characters involved in a desperate battle - while keeping the tone upbeat and hopeful. The good dragons are a surprising and delightful twist against preconceived notions that all dragons must be evil.<br /><br />Reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia in the imaginative creatures and characters, this has a tone and flavor all its own. Readers who loved the Chronicles will love this also. Yet they should come to it expecting something new and fresh. They won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I am eagerly anticipating dipping into the sequel - savoring it - like a second helping of dessert that is just a bit too rich for one sitting.<br /><br />Altogether a wonderful book	2005-08-28

This is a fantasy with surprising depth, dealing with dark issues, yet managing to keep a light and fun tone and feel. Despereaux is about as unlikely a hero as we will ever meet, often reduced to fear and trembling, yet overall showing a rare courage and a winsome belief in life and light.<br /><br />Geared to readers considerably younger than this Grandpa, yet older than my Grandson, this is a tale I look forward to reading to him in a few years.<br /><br />Somewhat difficult to categorize, it was simply a fun and rewarding book to read, well illustrated - and it left me feeling richer - having looked at life with the fresh newness of a child's vision.<br /><br />Highly recommended, this would be an outstanding book to read aloud within the classroom for elementary age students.	2005-08-09

This is a war story of astonishing depth and breadth.<br /><br />If the language had been kept more readable, giving just a hint of the accents and quaint expressions, rather than trying to make the reader hear every word and then translate it, I would willingly have given this book five stars. It is a rewarding read with splendid character development, but dangerously close to exhausting to work through the animal's speech. That said, the author has given meticulous attention to the detail of the language. For anyone willing to tackle the translation process, he has laid out an amazing challenge and a rich story. It is also a linguistic exercise of considerable value, although I doubt that was the author's intent.<br /><br />A great story, but a lazy or an over-tired reader will be defeated before getting well into it, which is quite unfortunate.	2005-08-09

Nature lovers will be caught up in the intimate details of the Amazon rainforest - especially as they can be shared vicariously without the sweat, the bug-bites and the snakes. Adventure lovers will find their appetite deeply satisfied. And those unwilling to simply read about an adventure, but wishing to actually experience it, will find a very sober warning before they launch themselves into the great wilderness of the Amazon basin.<br />The author's faith in God starts out like so many people in the North American Church - firm but little tested - almost a security blanket. The growth of that faith, repeatedly stretched to its absolute limits - is a key element of this story. The skepticism of other members of the team comes through with clarity and blunt honesty, actually enhancing the writing.<br />Altogether a wonderful and rewarding read. It left me hungering for more as well as searching for the earlier book, Romancing The Rain, which is unfortunately out of print at this time.	2005-08-04

Sleep Deprivation	Rich in plots, sub-plots, intrigue and surprising twists, this book should carry a warning: \\"Danger! Sleep Deprivation!<br /><br />Lonnie, a career missionary, loves the simple live, but carries baggage from broken relationships. Long-festering wounds of never quite measuring up to his money-hungry father, and the deep animosity between his brother and himself hints that his \\"Call\\" to the mission field is at least in part, running away.<br /><br />Coming home too late for reconciliation with his estranged brother, the will, read the day after the funeral, thrusts Lonnie into the leadership of a movie empire. It is one step from bankruptcy with an XXX rated film about to release. Lacking background knowledge of the film industry, distrusted by the employees he has suddenly inherited, and despised by his brother's son, Lonnie also battles a hostile takeover bid with inside corruption working against him.<br /><br />This is a tightly written story showing deep insights into the very human struggles of a man following a high calling. Lonnie is a fascinating and very \\"real\\" character, with all his hopes and dreams on the line, including the financial backing for his mission work. An unforgiving calendar with impossible deadlines looms. Financial pressures he has never imagined, with not just his own welfare, but other family members and his mission work under the gun push intensely toward compromise. And in the midst of it all, a relationship he thought long dead begins to grow again from deeply buried roots.<br /><br />Drawing on the writing strengths that made \\"If I Should Die\\" a wonderful and rewarding read, this book shows the author's greater grasp of his craft. A work that demands a fully engaged intellect, this is also richly entertaining and exceptionally difficult to put down. It holds fascinating questions to the very last page. Even the ending, far from a \\"they lived happily ever after\\" windup, is somehow rewarding and deeply satisfying.	2005-08-04

With an absolutely fascinating plot line that is skillfully developed, it is a story with almost limitless potential. Yet the writing itself is disappointing - more like a first draft than a polished work. This is a book that deserves to be revisited and rewritten when the author has gained a bit more depth and maturity as a writer. It has too much potential to be allowed to die. There is too much richness. All the potential is here for one of the truly great books of this generation - but it is an unmined treasure in its present form.<br /><br />This is one book I want in my personal library if its full richness is ever developed.	2005-06-29

Beck Easton, a widowed 5th level black belt with military intelligence background has all the requisite skills for his role, but barely escapes being somewhat flat. Jennifer Cassidy, an attractive research specialist, is a more colorful character with a vulnerability that makes her believable and winsome.<br /><br />The fascinating glimpse of historic cave diving before scuba gear is a delightful plus for this book, and some of the strongest writing. The technical cave diving - the hook that drew this reviewer to the book - received less attention than I had hoped for.<br /><br />The competing interests that all characters become obsessed with - and the clues to an ancient treasure in gold - seem contrived, but are almost imperative to drive the story.<br /><br />Still a good and enjoyable read in spite of the weaknesses. Overall a well crafted story with some intriguing historic tidbits.	2005-06-29

Among the highest tributes I can pay to an author is to say you have caused me to look at something in a totally new light, and given me a good, entertaining read in the process. A reader who is often frustrated with too little technical information, I found the balance of technical detail near perfect. It left me hungry for more, but shouldn't cause other readers to bog down.<br />A couple of apparent logic problems are grappled with by the main character as he strives to comprehend technology outside his experience and training. They aren't just swept over with the hope that readers won't catch them. That had me - with the characters - searching for answers.<br />I was pulled into this story from the very beginning, fascinated throughout, and entirely unprepared for the windup - yet deeply satisfied with it. This is altogether a winner.	2005-06-28

The comparison to Tolkien - I think - does an injustice to both this author and to Tolkien. They are not in the same league and a reader who goes to this book expecting Tolkien's writing style cannot help but be disappointed. Yet I recommend it without hesitation on its own merits.<br /><br />A basic Bible knowledge will be of help to the reader in following some of the symbolism, although word-plays and coined words often disguise the symbolism that is there. Many - perhaps most - Christian readers will struggle with some of the occult references. It is not a \\"feel-good\\" book for Christian readers. It grapples with key issues and exposes corruption in high places within the church.<br /><br />Very much a genre book, this story is somehow breaking across typical genre boundaries and drawing a wide and diverse readership.<br /><br />It is worth checking out and forming your own opinion.	2004-08-15

It is a book I'd rather my daughters didn't read, yet I feel that they MUST. Like so much of Farley Mowat's work, MY FATHER'S SON gives a chapter of Canadian history that was never taught in school. Brutal, obscene and probably unfair at times, it consists mostly of a collection of letters exchanged between a son and his parents separated by an ocean and a war. It is refreshingly free of political correctness. The blunt honesty of a 20 something nature lover crouched in a slit trench while he dispenses death and comrades die around him -- comes with the uncensored vocabulary of men and women caught in hell. Distilled from the stink of gunpowder and the scream of falling shells in the muddy trenches of Italy, it is 200 proof, uncut. This tea-totaler has gasped at every sip, taken offense at the language and morals, yet ranked it among the most worthwhile books he has ever read. It won't be found on the shelves of Bible Book Stores, with good reason. Yet if this writer had the authority, it would be back in print and mandatory reading before any Canadian could graduate from High School. Out of the many thousands of books I have read over the years, MY FATHER'S SON is a story with few peers. It doesn't fit any genre, it makes its own. It doesn't read smoothly and comfortably, it rends the fabric of cozy prejudice. It doesn't glorify war, it paints it as the hell it is. Perhaps more than anything else, it reminds me of the price my freedom cost, a reminder I don't always want to receive.<br /><br />This is a book that shouldn't be out of print, but copies are readily available on the used book market.	2004-08-14

But he does so from a completely fresh perspective.<br /><br />A young reporter risks her job and her life, entering a nursing home after receiving a professional make-over, searching for the real story behind the palpable fear among residents.<br /><br />The pithy wisdom of Ruth, a sprightly old woman with a mind as crisp as the crack of a whip; the sometimes winsome, sometimes whining, but always very human effeminate makeup artist, Peter, who assists Laurie with her disguise as she tries desperately to not overdo forty years of instant aging; and the Nursing Home Director in financial crisis, resorting to the \\"Peaceful Slumber\\" room to ease finacial burdens -- are all tied together by a main character who somehow acts as a catalyst, taking a straight-forward plot and repeatedly surprising the reader.<br /><br />The sensative and compassionate development of Peter, who struggles with his sexual orientation, combined with the tough love of Ruth, an uncompromising senior who confonts his tendencies head-on, while accepting him fully as a person, achieves some of the most effective writing on gay issues in print.<br /><br />Another mark of the genius of the writing is that much of the time we actually \\"Like\\" the Nursing Home Director and ache for him as he battles his financial demons. We disagree, but understand and almost sympathize as he resorts to desperate measures. He is not an inherently evil man that we love to hate. He is a man caught in a world of muddy ethics; a \\"victim\\" of his time who is simply following the logic of a world that values \\"Quality of Life\\" more than \\"Life\\" itself.<br /><br />Topnoch writing, this book is also far more. It speaks strongly and effectively to pertinent issues. Not for the lazy reader, Clemons will exercise your intellect, grip your imagination and your emotions and keep you turning pages late into the night. He will leave you mulling over issues for months to come. Never preachy, this book achieves that rare balance of masterful storytelling, gripping entertainment, and a message that engages your mind and calls you to think. BUY IT!! READ IT!!

I know for I have spent years unlearning things I \\"knew\\" for more than thirty years.<br /><br />A non-Catholic myself, I actually became fearful before completing this book that Scott Hahn was going to persuade me I HAD to become Catholic if I was going to approach my faith with intellectual honesty while taking the Bible seriously (issues of great importance to me). The arguments are presented with simple clarity and Biblical authority that rings true. They are arguments that conflicted with my prejudices, but not with Biblical teaching. Perhaps stronger even than the logic, however, is the reality that Hahn fought against that logic every step of the way. Coming from a non-Catholic background himself, and steeped in anti-Catholic teaching, in-depth study drew him against his intense resistance, to embrace the Catholic faith.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book, very dangerous to deep rooted prejudice, but giving a wealth of insight into the Biblical foundation of key Catholic beliefs and traditions. It is invaluable for Catholic and non-Catholic alike. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to understand the teachings of the Catholic church, from either inside or outside. I will also give fair warning to those who cherish a strong anti-Catholic bias -- this is a dangerous book to read if you are intent on holding onto that bias.<br /><br />My respect for Catholic Brothers and Sisters has multiplied greatly, this book being a catalyst in the process. I don't know how to pay higher tribute to an author than to say \\"Thank you for helping me see old things with new eyes.\\" My understanding of my own faith, and the many core beliefs we share is deeper and richer today because of this book.	2004-08-13

No English document in history has had an impact comparable to this work in any of three key areas; Literature, History, or Spiritual. Yet I have the privilege - and others like me - to hold in my hands a copy of one of the earliest issues of this great book. I don't have to go to a University Library or some ancient Monastery and gaze at it through glass. Nor do I have to mortgage my home for the purchase price, though even that would undervalue this book.<br /><br />It wants a better poet than me to find language for the value of this document. It probably requires someone who has risked his or her life to own a Bible to begin to comprehend its true worth.<br /><br />Of special interest to historians as well as theologians is the lengthy and detailed section on English Translations that predate the 1611 King James Bible. The Calendars are also a fascinating resource.<br /><br />With clear, easy-reading type (very much a surprise to me) yet the authentic spelling, sentence structure, organization and footnotes, this volume makes all that wealth readily accessible. I don't use my copy as much as other Bibles I own, for the Old English makes for a challenging read.

This book falls into none of those traps, bringing simple comforting word-pictures backed by the gentle beauty of heart-warming illustrations.<br /><br />Laurie Snow Hein has done a superb job of under-girding the story with her artwork, managing to cross age, gender and race boundaries while enhancing the text.<br /><br />This work stands firmly on a foundation of truth implicit in Biblical teaching.<br /><br />This is a rich book. It does not promise to take away the pain, nor does it in any way mock or belittle the tears that most readers have shed and will shed. It gives comfort and hope that shines through the tears.<br /><br />A valuable and needed contribution, a treasure in my personal library.<br /><br />From a grandfather looking forward to a reunion - fully convinced of God's love and of eternal life - but still sometimes aching too deeply for words.	2004-08-13

US	30070815	R14HQ35RPQDOEE	B0002H7GIA	964386491	Blink	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Don't Blink / You Don't  Want to Miss Anything	Seth Border and Miriam, daughter of Prince Salman bin Fahd, live worlds apart, physically, culturally and socially. Seth, with a razor sharp intellect, makes waves among the academic elite. Miriam runs from a forced marriage in Saudi Arabia. Thrust together in a bizarre escape, drawing the combined but competing attention of one of the most powerful oil-lords in the world as well as the FBI, Seth's gifted mind plots each step in a desperate race where the prize is their lives.<br /><br />How do you describe a mind that plays with quantum physics with the ease of a high-school math wiz handling Grade 2 Arithmetic? Bigger challenge - how do you show that mind in a light that us lesser mortals can comprehend? The incredible flashes of insight Seth employs would strip almost any novel of credibility, yet somehow Dekker pulls this one off.<br /><br />A fascinating story that pulls together such divergent themes as Christian / Muslim interactions, Woman's Rights, International security, and the inner working of the human mind. Dekker has also spun an immensely readable tale of edge of your seat fiction. From page one to the closing paragraph, this work combines entertainment, insight, thrills and spills and just plain good writing.	2004-08-07

Containing romance, but not driven by romance, it deserves a thoughtful reading for the clear message of wholesome morality and even more for what it says about the erosion of genuine freedom.  It proves as applicable and timely north of the Canada/U.S. border as south of it and is still surprisingly relevant nine years after publication.	2004-01-29
