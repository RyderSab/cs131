This is the story of a century of great adventurers from Victorian England and Tsarist Russia as they struggled for control of Central Asia. The back and forth between the two great Ninteenth Century powers is gripping as they use force and guile over what is now Iran, Iraq, Afganistan and the various other &quot;-stans&quot; that were former Soviet states.<br />The history is told through the varios exploits of Russian and British men who travel through lands unknown and risk their lives for adventure and Mother Country.  <br />While most all of the stories are fascinating, it is hard to keep track of the years when the stories take place. The book is more like a series of great stories rather than a flowing narrative. It is also very Anglo-centric and would have been better to have been more balanced.<br />This book is recommended for those particulary interested in this era but not to anyone else.	2001-01-24

For the curious, a hypergraph consists of a set V and a set E of subsets of S. A graph is a special case of a hypergraph where each element of E has cardinality two.<br />Published in 1989, this book has become, by default, the authoritative text on hypergraphs.  It does not delve into more advanced, technical results (e.g.: asymptotics, etc...) but instead covers all the fundamental material related to hypergraphs (e.g.: Helly property, Konig property, Kruskal-Katona, etc...). Since hypergraphs are usually not part of standard curricula, this book has definitely carved out its own niche. Practically every paper which mentions hypergraphs (written since 1989) references it.<br />This book appears to be written for practicing mathematicians (or sufficiently sophisticated students) who have stumbled upon a combinatorial problem and are in need of some basic (though non-obvious) results. Thus, in many cases, results are presented somewhat tersely and with little context or motivation with the implicit assumption that the reader already knows what hypergraphs are good for and is skillful enough to navigate the densely packed theorems.	2001-01-18

It covers all the basic subjects (big-O notation, trees, graphs, etc...) as well as a few intermediate subjects (amortized analysis, matroids, etc...). Of course, this book is not the be-all and end-all of computer science nor does it pretend to be. It touches on NP-completeness only lightly and all but omits randomization; but if you wanted a text on NP-completeness, you would be reading Garey &amp; Johnson and if you wanted randomization you'd go to Motwani &amp; Raghavan. But if you need a reference on data structures and algorithms, this is the book for you.<br />Now, some have complained that while this book is an excellent reference that it is a poor text to learn from. I beg to differ. I concede that it is certainly more demanding than many other introductory texts, but this is a boon not a curse. By remaining true to computer science's mathematical heritage, Cormen et al. force the reader to become accustomed to rigourous, formal reasoning, something which is unfortunately absent in many computer science curricula. The authors present the concepts cleanly and clearly, without the distraction of any specific programming language/paradigm. Perhaps it is this removal from a familiar C/C++/Java/flavour-of-the-month/etc... milieu which makes some readers nervous. But it is precisely this separation which forces the reader up into the realm of abstraction where computer science truly resides.	2001-01-18
US	47925868	R18AGLC1K9BGJ0	0132278286	967293220	Introduction to Graph Theory	Books	1	15	23	N	N	Not for beginners	One of the main problems of writing a textbook on graph theory is the relative immaturity of the field. Unlike, say, algebra or analysis, it is difficult to establish exactly which concepts and topics are considered part of the &quot;canon&quot; and where they rank in importance. Sure, matchings should be covered but is that more or less important than colouring? Should edge colourings be even considered? And so forth. There is no universally agreed upon introductory graph theory syllabus.<br />Given this complication, I find it hard to fault this book for its seemingly slap-dash selection (and treatment) of topics. Personally, I would have preferred less on planarity and k-factors and more on coloring and random graphs. Also, I don't think that spectral graph theory and Ramsey theory belong in an introductory text. After all, why bring up these topics if you can't explore them to any intelligent degree? But again, I realize that these complaints may be petty and reflect only my personal tastes.<br />However, what truly sinks this book are its errors. Sprinkled liberally throughout the text like chocolate chips in a Chips Ahoy cookie, these mistakes (typos?) are at times flagrant, at times subtle. In any case, it is these errors which make this book unsuitable for beginners which, judging by the subject matter, are the target audience. Unless you are already familiar with the theorems and their proofs, it is very easy to become terribly confused.	2001-01-18

Often it is not even considered a field in its own right but merely a grab-bag of disparate tricks to be exploited by other, nobler endeavours. Where is the glory in simply counting things? This book goes a long way towards shattering these old stereotypes. By unifying enumerative combinatorics under a strong algebraic framework, Aigner finally bestows upon the humble act of counting the respect it so surely deserves.<br />At first, it may be somewhat trying to make sense of his presentation as he reworks familiar results in this algebraic view. Often, I was left wondering why it is necessary to go through the trouble of all these high-powered techniques just to obtain results we've already obtained through much simpler means. However, as I progressed through the chapters, it became clear that the only consistent way to tackle the truly difficult problems in enumeration was with these algebraic tools.<br />If you are serious about combinatorics or merely interested in what combinatorics has to offer, this volume is certainly a valuable addition to your library.	2001-01-09

I want to describe it in a way that reviewers typically describe a work of fiction but it is a true story. The book is meticulously footnoted and referenced yet reads like a novel.<br />It tells the story of Leopold II of Belgium who ruled an area many times larger than his true country yet never set foot there. He was a master of P.R. who used the popular press to manipulate his way to tremendous wealth. Leopold's reign was brutal and devastating to an innocent population. <br />The stories of many other players in this era are also very well told from heros like Morel and Casement who tried to put an end to the horror to rogues like the famous explorer, Stanley. Most interesting of all of them is the story of Stanley, famous for finding Livingstone, who's true past is explored in great detail. <br />The wickedness of went on in present day Congo still echos today. This book give great insight to a sad, sad era.	2001-01-06

Chomsky, as ever, writes without condescension and without pretension.<br />Even if you disagree with his thoughts, you cannot deny his sheer intellect, his astounding command facts, and his unwavering determination to be clear.

Wow.	This dictionary is great man.  It's better than any thesaurus, it tells you the difference between words that are alike , or similar, or kinda the same, or akin, or homogenous.  You may be thinking that I used the same word over and over again, but this book says, uh unh.  These words are different, so use them differently.<br />Pure genius.  Why didn't I think of it?  Probably because my english sucks.  But if you want to be a writer like me, man, this is the book for you.	2000-10-04

You are left confused but with a feeling of satisfaction that reminds you of a good steak.<br />  Mr. Pollack does not write for a specific human group or way of life.  He does not even try to appeal to the intellectuals as opposed to the bores.  He works on all levels, the brain and the gut and everything in betweeen.  And it stings like hell.   But you love it, and you want more.<br />  He has gotten at the root of American Literature with more vigor than Twain and more eloquence that James.  He has understood the American question of culture and answered it.  We are now at the beginning of a new generation of literature and intellect that will change American society forever.  <br />  Some will think Pollack a rebel, others will cite him as nothing more than today's fancy, some will accuse him of corrupting the minds of the youth.  And to that all, I say Pollack is Pollack, he will last forever in English literature through his brilliant fictional narratives, his ingenious twists of prose, and more than anything else his penetrating insight.  His anthology is the most impressive since Nicolas Bourbaki's and I would argue even more important.	2000-09-22
