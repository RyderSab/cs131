The ingredients are okay, the mix of all marinading and  battering ingredients and portions are not so good and actually not even  authentic.

Put long, whole uncut string beans like snakes crawling inside your dish, and call it rainbow? Decorated a cooked dish with lot of small whole raw tomatos and jammed them among the cooked food? There is no way that I could  accept such kind of gimmicky stuff and treated them as Chinese food.  Putting raw stuff in or on a well cooked Chinese dish is just like turning  it into something totally messed up. But I can understand that kind  arrangements are just for photos in the book. Too gimmicky, man. And one  more thing to remind: Never used too fancy, too complicated designed, and  too colorful plates to hold the FOOD; as plates could only be used to make  the food on them stand out, not bury them or block them with strong colors  and patterns. Such disturbing distraction is the worst dream that any  restaurant owner or chef would commit mindlessly.	1999-01-31

Also,  when read this one, Harry has become a  kinda guy mellowed too much, and  has become quite estranged. Not a lone wolf with strong inner conflict  anymore, but a married guy with a compulsive gambling wife. This kind of  transformation is the worst kind of writing a NOVEL, i.e., you just let a  hero created in a good novel series become too human and would grow too old  too soon, and finally would have to let him die. If Harry Bosch's inner  conflict finally turned into certain marital problem, then this series  would be diluted into a tasteless family stuff. Don't do this, Mr.  Connelly, keep the hero on the right track, and you, please don't lose  focus again.	1999-01-29

The oz/g/lb and USxxxx names almost drove me nuts! Some of the  photos even placed food in chipped plates or bowls is another rarity in  recipes books. Also, why treated readers as morons and need to repeat in  all the recipes with the same &quot;how to wash,&quot; &quot;how to  mix&quot; the same ingredient?!

It only makes me wonder whether the patrons would have to go to Burger King or all-you-can-eat buffet joint to fill up the  empty stomach after dined in her restaurant. By using so many and so much  &quot;star anise&quot; and &quot;peppercorn&quot; in almost every dish is  something that I'd never try and never want to eat! If you could call most  of these dishes as innovative Chinese Cuisine you must be crazy, because it  should just be called &quot;int'l or whatever-you-name-it cuisine&quot;, or  more French than Chinese? Yeah, just eat the decoration and presentation  and pay rip-off prices. If you could mix up all the ingredients--the  Kosher, Mexican, French, Greek, Italian, Russian....besides the Chinese--  you could find in America's supermarket and make them into crazy recipes as  many and as bold as you could imagine, you just cannot call them Chinese  cuisine anymore, it's a mixture and bastard kind of food but definitely not  Chinese! Furthermore, if any ingrdient could be randomly mixed together,  why you still need a recipes book like this one?! Just use your imagination  and get all the ingredients in your local supermarket, then you might  invent more crazy stuff. All I could suggest is that you never eat anything  that needed to be (re)arranged on the plate by hands(fingers) in the  kitchen, i.e., beware the cross contamination! Don't eat anything in any  Cafe or restaurant that has to be made by the waiter or waitress who, after  they takes order from you. Their hands are so dirty since they have to do  lot of side works, collecting other tables' soiled dishes, handling dirty  paper money and making changes.	1999-01-22

Dana so far is the most desirable  partner that any street cop could dream of. He died in the later stage of  this book, but Anderson simply missed the chance to make this book a real  touching one, he made Hanson a totally heartless s.o.b., albeit Dana's  widow was even worse.

If the answer was yes, then our USofA would definitely in big trouble. The author had  inevitablely gave me an impression that the whole NSA scenes inside out  were just so obviously fake, since he could only imagine the tight security  for entry, but once got in, he just could not provide us with more  realistic pictures, so he just failed to visualize correctly and to  deliver.  So, what we got here from him were couple of very unprofessional,  sexual harassing jerk like Hale, an egghead nerd, a very unconvincing IQ170  woman, her multi-lingualled sweetheart, an old, stress sticken No.2 guy, a  steel-rimmed killer, plus several security guards outside the NSA building.  Putting a Japanese American as some kind traitor, doing some personal  vandetta to NSA and its personnel is still a legacy of the pathetic  American syndrome orginated and still die-hard from WWII--the Asian  Americans simply would not be accepted completely as other racial  Americans, so, guilty until proven innocent; put them in concentration camp  before they become the snitches, informers, or traitors--the  (Japanese)American, even he had passed the security check to be qualified  as an NSA employee, but he's doomed to be unstable, untrustworthy and would  inevitablely became a traitor and sold his 'Digital Fortress' to his  Japanese folks in Japan. This is a disgusting logic that made me appreciate  more to the &quot;Mercury Rising&quot; movie. At least there were only real  Americans being betrayed and killed, and all the Japanese people in that  movie were just purely innocent, big dollar-spending tourists.	1998-11-21

Putting  suppose-to-be-priceless paintings underground of a church with a river  close by? How could anyone with common sense would store any painting in a  wet--not just humid--underground vault with dripping walls?

All in all, this is a  quite sad and pathetic story about a heavily flawed person with a not quite  likable and understanding wife, lousy job choices, bad decisions and goofy  friends and foes.

I've tried this J.P.'s new book again like a sucker, and again, I failed to grap why his books would become so popular. The continued research in his popularity is still a myth to me so far. This book, as his others, is  so pretentious, unnatural, contrived, forcefully twisted without proper  logic. I have to agree with those who gave this book a minimal ratings. The  reason I awarded it with 2 star is for his die-trying pretentious attitude,  at least he's always trying to write a book with big-screen mind. What can  I say? Once one of an novelist's books was bought by Hollywood, he would  fantasize that his next one (or the older ones) would hit again by a  Hollywood sucker, so he would start writing screenplays instead of the real  thing--a decent novel, all he could create with his imagination is to focus  on the overly twisted plots, he would only treat his readers as movie goers  and couldn't care less. This book is an insult to a qualified reader.	1998-11-03

Of course,  all the blocks were linked tightly and wouldn't fall apart, but once the  sucker was completed, it looked pretty cool by Leggo standard, but it's  also a creation in a rigid dumb style, no beauty at all, man.

The coolest part of this book is that of its short but just fine and  appropriate chapters. The pathetic strike scene really have made me think  twice about the employer vs. employees as well as employment stuff. Tony  Hunt is one of the baddest(worst) corporate CEOs a labor/employee could  ever meet. The tunnel scenes are definitely not imagined or dreamed up by a  guy who never got the realistic experience in Nam. What turned me off a  little bit is the religious part; lighting a candle could link to the other  world....that's totally crap and BS, man, but that great church could stay  and is okayed by me anyway. Just like after finished reading of any good  novel, I wish I could visit Elk River, Ohic someday to look around if  there's a real town in that name and exactly in that place.

Basically, it's just about a story of a writer's life suffered a sudden  change after his wife died abruptly. Then he suffered a 'writer block'  syndrome. He also suffered a male hormone clogging problem since before his  wife died, they usually made lot of love whenever and whereever available.  He missed his wife so badly and just couldn't resist from feeling his dead  wife's presence every where he went. Just like Willy Lamb's 'I know this  much is true,' both books are inappropriately and unnecessarily so overly  written that made the plot, if there was any, so loose and diluted. But of  course, if you're a housewife (not a housekeeper) or unemployed(or employed  with an easy workload), you've got all the time in the world to read the  beautifully crafted prose just to kill the time, then it's quite okay to  give both a higher rating. These huge-and-thick-book writers are the worst  enemies of the environmental preservation, slaughtered more trees  indirectly than you could imagine and publishers should use recycled  instead of virgin papers to print these kind books. The writers in this  kind category should also know how to rein their fingers on the keyboard  since they are now putting their words in the diskettes, they might totally  forget and overlook how many papers would be consumed to print out and bind  into a book later. Readers should also be aware that you might suffer  'Reader's Elbow' by holding these heavy books too long during reading. This  is not a joke and should be taken seriously.	1998-10-25

I actually considered this writer's writing in this book was pretty cool,  very concise, very natural,and very clear-cut, and I like it very much. The  guy who said his writing is not good, I'd like to recommend him to read the  &quot;really wonderful&quot; writing of &quot;Meg.&quot; Then he might know  that Mcgarrity was unfairly critized by a Santa Fe guy like him. When I  read it, I could feel that the author was a genuine police veteran, cuz he  knows what he's writing. The plot is not bad either, only two things made  me wonder a bit: 1)Why Sara wanted to investigate a guy like Kerny? There  was no need to do that if she's already accepted what Andy told her over  the phone; 2)Although the south-of-the-border scenes were quite real too,  but that part was read like a totally different one inserted into a bigger  book. But nevertheless, it's still quite cool. To me, folks, this book is a  better version of Nelson's deMille's &quot;The General Daughter.&quot; What  made it better is that therein existed a great character, Kevin Kerny, a  tough guy with both steel will and romanticism, a hero who we can learn  something from and to be respected at the same time. I'm going to get all  McGarrity's books to fulfill such rare foundness.	1998-10-06

At first, it looked quite interesting and promising, but  then, it lost its steam in the later pages of the first part. I've struggle  a lot trying to read on, but became so mad against those main and/or  supporting characters. You know what I did finally? I tore up the paperback  in half and threw it to the bedside floor! A total 690 pages blah, blah,  blah, and it should be shrunk at least 250 pages, and then, it might become  more readable and not so frustrated.	1998-09-26

There is no real bad guys or  good guys but small timers or not-quite-lovable characters in this book.  Several unforgiven overlooks of wrong spellings such as &quot;then&quot;  printed as &quot;than;&quot; &quot;laughed&quot; as &quot;laughted&quot;.  With no big deal plots, hero and/or heroine worth remembering, just like  those lukewarm and tasteless stories created by Tony Hillerman and Sue  Grafton, killing time's fine if you don't have too many choices at hand.	1998-09-26

Is this a genuine piece of work by Morrell, the great writer whose former  creative products so deeply engrossed and enchanted me?? Terrible  characters, rigid scenario, lousy plots, a bore-to-death read from page 1  to the end that made me really wish Labour Day would come sooner! There is  absolutely no chemistry at all in this book, man. A lifeless, charactreless  photographer cut out of a cardboard, and the first part of this double  image almost read like architecture digest, featuring the &quot;Now &amp;  Then&quot; of Beverly Hill (who cares?!)  Morrell's typical trademark of  pressurized paranoia is totally missing in this pathetic book. I was just  fooled by its 1st chapter that looked somehow promising but later proved to  be NADA at all. The most ridiculous part of this book is when Coltrane and  his woman tried to run away from their Cerbic stalker; bought two  airticket, run to Las Vegus, and then came back right away to L.A. I really  failed to comprehend what they would do such stupid thing, if they were so  assured that during the whole runaway-and-comeback operation, they were not  followed by that killer. So, running away to Las Vegus, switching flight  and getting back to L.A.  was a totally purposeless thing to do. This  terrible novel only splitted my brain and eyes into a double fuzzy image, a  so-called thriller that couldn't stop me from yarnings. This is one of the  worst books I've read in Summer98. Thanks for nothing, man, and I wish that  I could return it and get a refund.	1998-09-07

The only drawback is that lots of the  chapters, especially the earlier ones, are unnecessarily long, slow and  overly detailed; the &quot;gold pond syndrome&quot;, a sign that even most  great writers could not avoid when time flies. But, he indeed portrayed the  miserable and pathetic situation of all the modern day Muslim women have  been suffering and are facing now. Anyway, this book might turn Hilton Head  island into another would-be haven pested with retired agents and assassins  in retreat, just like Maxim turned his formerly resided city into a vest of  vipers, a mirage doomed to arise whereever he relocated.	1998-08-29

The structure  of this book is tight, the tension of the plot so unbearable that once you  start, it'd never let you put down until the last page is flipped over. The  scenario, well, quite convincing and believable. All the characters are  also well crafted. A born writer with deep insight of human nature. This  novel should be in the top 10 bestseller list; if not, a serious  promotional marketing(or just totally non-exist?) problem must be  corrected.

Mr. Child is a thinking writer who has so far visualized and delivered two pretty good stories and one superb and unique character, Jack Reacher. But he should be aware not to use too many stack-up sentences one after another in almost of all the paragraphs. By using stacking up sentenses in describing a situation and fell into a stereotype is a habit that may jeopardise the whole structure of a good book in the long run. Neither should he lose focus during the later stage(or chapters) showing his hasteness to wrap up the story; it was the time when some of the illogic and ridiculous question marks would appear, just like what happened in his last &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, i.e., using bleach to bleach out the used paper money--a ridiculous way to wrap up the funny money business. Same thing happened this time in &quot;Die Trying&quot.  One last advice to Mr. Child: Don't get any too large scaled military/militia/FBI actions or confrontation again; Jack Reacher might become even greater and more interesting if he could just do without a national-security emergency.  Furthermore, this book could become even better if the publisher could do larger instead of fine printing; saving paper plus cost is one thing, but killing readers's eyesights is definitely not recommendable, G.P. Putman!	1998-08-24

The law couldn't do nothing and has to let the rich  doctor go away with the triple murders is just another bad laugh after the  OJ Simpson's trial. A pathetic, small-time PI struggled to make a miserable  living in LA after so many years is another hopeless irony that we could do  without.

MegaSoft obviously portrayed Microsoft as the  author indeed was one of the wizboys in that copycat empire, while Jack  Malcom and Ted Nesbitt were clones of the current two hot public figures of  it. As to Jonatham, well, not a quite welcoming creation since he looked  pretty stupid and always on step behind the evolved scenario in many ways.  How could Malcom survived from the assassination in pointblank? And if I  were that assassin moved on to him so close, I'd put three shots to his  head, neck, and the chest, instead of his upper torso that might be  protected by a body armour worn under the suit. Why and how Jon would only  call MegSoft's security after he witnessed a murder in one of its parking  lots, instead of calling 911 directly , as a normal, common citizen? If he  could survive and climb the MegaSoft ladder so high as to the hottest  project, Jon was suppose to be smart, but how could he not become  suspicious when the security team that appeared on the scene asked him just  to go home and without any real police force ever presented? As I read  along, the inexplanable and illogic business-as-usual scenes, the reactions  of Jon and other characters, as normal human beings should have behaved,  almost jumped out of every chapter with so many whys and hows ???? that  only meant the author did a very poor research on any other fields and  didn't quite know jack of all trades except his computer exprience and its  jargon stuff. This is a story with lot of twists that sometimes over  twisted unreasonablly or just poorly twisted not enough, but of course,on  the otherhand, it's far better than what &quot;MEG&quot;--THE DEEP SEA  TERROR--had moronically tried to deliver in the summer97.	1998-08-22

The problem of this novel is that the author did not get a tight grip of  everything, wasted lot of pages on describing the relationship of Michael  Osbourne and his wife; the President was sufferig a low rating in the poll  and not popular(what a repetive bore). Besides, the alocations of the  whereabouts were also quite stereotyped. Why a  terrorist group would  always send a fax first to a guy worked in Times, London, and then it had  to be passed along again to MI5, and then, inevitably repeatively passed  along to CIA?  Don't understand why should we have to read so many  tasteless yet so detailed blabblahblah, man? This book and its author just  gave me an impression of the mixtured wannabe of F. Forsyth(The Icon) and  J. Archer(The 11th Commandment)--only regretfully worse--and my, my, my,  these three books are so alike. The other problem of this book is that the  author has used lot of straight-ahead sentences almost in every page but  failed to be improved by his editors, making the read even more tiresome  and bored. For instance, the last paragraph on P.72, only the first  sentence sounded quite promising, &quot;The President looked very  exhausted.&quot; Then, all of the following sentences begun with a &quot;He  had..., he had..., he turned..., he had...&quot; There is no way to call  this novel a thriller since it was so loose, forcing me to read it like a  3rd-party moron chewing a candle off, then spitting out the tasteless  tidbits hopelessly.	1998-08-15

A work that transcended &quot;Gold Coast&quot; and &quot;Presume Innocent&quot;, while the up-and-coming author undoubtedly would also take over both books's authors whose current conditions obviously are going downhill. This book was very well written, the plot and scenario all wonderfully woven and knitted. Every line with a subtle touch of sense of humour that moderately mingled with the desparate mid-life crisis. Ben not only was a more human hero rather than a vicious murderer but also an innocent, accidental and reluctant victim fell prey to his life and marriage. Young readers gave lower ratings only meant short of the realistic tastelessness of the experience after 30. Couldn't wait for your next book, Mr. Kennedy! And where have you been these years, sir?

Just finished this one in one sitting. There is only one small glitch that made it a bit unbelievable, the CIA turn-coat guy and all his sidekicks turning out to be all Soviet/Russia folks in the end? Wow, totally blew out of water, man. Anyway, except this too dramatic twist, these four-book &quot;Bob The Nailer&quot; series are just like four bottles of Burgandy, man, all primed from the vintage years and best of all, Mr. Hunter's writing also runs cooler like a chilled Chablis, pure, transparent, and clear-cut.

The first several chapters were so pretentious, rigid, awkward, reluctant and tasteless. There was no way you could believe Jane loved her doctor husband, because you failed to find any intimacy between this couple's conversation that even non-exist between doctor and his patients in a real life. It read more like a writer who never married and could not imagine a natural and normal way how a couple should and would talk to each other. The dialogues were terrible, I mean, not just the husband/wife part, almost all the conversations in the whole book were so rigid and out of picture, besides the dragging unnecessary long narrative lines in between. I've read every former book written by this great writer, not only enjoyed it but collected all of them. This time, to this particular could-hardly-wait new book, regretfully turned out to be a pain-in-the-neck to read along. I have to leapfrog and kept flipping the pag! es forward or backward, trying very hard to get something interesting to get myself hooked up but unsuccessfully until the end. What went wrong? No chemistry, man, no sparkles anymore like before, man. What a shame....	1998-08-09

There is no need to detail the process of making drugs unless you're blindly grasping the faith of freedom of speech. Making an announcement in the very beginning advising readers not trying to make the deadly drug, but almost provided the necessary ingredients, piles of raw materials copied from his narcotic retiree wife, adding more stereotyped but on the other hand, highly unlikely plot and scenario derived and misinterpretated from some current news or some whimsical ideas provided by some wannabe writers from the readers through the emails, have become a pathetic mode  of Brown's recent books. Even worse, some totally unbelievable hero obviously originated and combined from some comic and sci-fi books--the rocketeer+shadow(or ghost?)+spiderman+whatever you name it. Not quite a good way to bind up a so-called thriller.	1998-08-09

Train was a hero that could be singled out as an independent character but the author made him always one step(sometimes, even pathetically and stupidly several steps) behind Galantz, the sweeper who turned bad and beyond salvage. Gutter, the vicious Dobberman used by Train to protect the heroine was an unique touch, while using an old Japanese couple as his housekeepers was a too stereotyped flaw. Neither the detective turning out to be another sweeper was quite logic but an unnatural twist. This novel, in general, is still quite readable.	1998-08-05

The guy doesn't look like a cop in the first place albeit a serial killer. This is the first time I've read a serial killer who just kills those familiar folks around him. The scenario becomes even more ridiculous when he kills and kills again and again, senselessly and violently, all the other to-protect-and-serve colleague are just like a bunch of helpless morons only respond to the order of a local businessman, not a mob guy, not a politician, just a filthy businessman?

I've been in Fresno several times, also knew that this once quiet, beautiful, pugatory hot town in the big nowhere of California, now proudly to get the title as the crime capital of California. All the characters and plot are logically developed. Poetic, romantic and at the same time, violent. Bill Malone is just like the bodyguard guy in A.J.

Beautifully written yet unnecessarily overstrung to the extreme that diluted the thickness of nectar. The chronical year of 1969 was inappropriately detailed, especially out of the memory of a first person's narrative,  just as impossible as some procecutor asking the witness or the defendent to recite certain specific timing trivia happened long long time ago. Reading what happened in 1969 could only bring a thinking and conscious reader out of the total commitment to realize that only Wally Lamb, the writer, could memorize such small happencetenses in vivid details but absolutely not possible for the character in the his book to blah blah blah so clearly. Lamb should put much more ratio on D's other personal matters instead of merely concentrating on D's brother's Thomas. Then, it might become more interesting to read as one of the common stories that might have realistically happened among the ordinary people like all of us. A quite beautifully re-constructed giant book by a modern Chales Dickens, Summerset Maugham and, most of all, Dr. S. Freud.	1998-06-29

The final chapter of ultimate betrayal turned out to be very sad yet very illogically put... The dramatic ending was just one of the overdone twists of the plots.

Mr. Connelly delivered again this time, making a novel quite readable and knowledgeable. His style has become more natural and smooth. Except the loneliness of the hero that is always there, this time, he let a heart-transplanted divorced guy find true love in the end, a gentler and kinder ending than what his Harry Bosch series ended up with. Mr. Connelly also let the reader get a true picture of how repeatively boring but intensive when a guy tried to solve several lukewarm or even cold murder cases; what kind of a**hole detective(Det. Arrago} and die-hard detective(Det. Winston) should be. As always, by linking the unsolved &quot;Code Killer&quot; with this new novel is a quite seamless patchwork done by him. Only some have-to-be-repeative parts in this novel could be flipped easily through if you would like to speed up your reading.	1998-05-31

I kept wondering during reading this novel, did the author really know something about Yakusa? What kind of outlandish scenario and plot here in this novel? If Reese, the hero armed with two master degrees; one of them, computer science, then why his only entertainment and recreation is to play chess with a colleague BY MAIL instead of playing it on-line? Baxter Acedemy is a college for rich students or a military camp, or a concentration camp? Yakusa? How much Balling really knows about Yakusa, the No.1 Japanese crime organization? Before putting one of the funny ingredients into his creation, did the author really perform certain in-depth research in this territory, or just got his information off the big screen or his 27&quot; tube? The conspiracy designed by Balling is just as ridiculous as what DeMille created in his last &quot;Plum Island&quot;, except Balling didn't have time to create a wise-craching guy, since he surely was busy in putting lot of MSG and funny stuff in his cooking pot to lure those blindly hungry movie script scavengers from Hollywood to have a big bowl full of everything and anything you could find in the screenplay market.

US	51956980	R3ET3NLZBCF2E6	0786889152	327415185	Sunset Express: An Elvis Cole Novel	Books	3	0	5	N	N	Trying to be funny but came short with lot of ???marks	I've borrowed this novel from the local library, but as soon as I opened it, I've found many former readers have left a lot of question marks on the margine space on many pages. After I've read through, I've also found that the usually very annoying marks left behind by other readers were quite pardonable, because all the question marks were quite appropriate and reasonable. Crais obviously got almost all the police/detective stuff third-handly from the tube or the big screen. Like others, I just couldn't believe that Rossi still got to check the pulse of an already rotton decomposed corpse(???); Murderers almost always dumped the murder weapon with the body(??); leave it for the criminalist instead of the forensic team(?)....on and on. Especially when the dialogue written by Crais tried very hard to be funny and wisecracking, such as &quot;Don't you have a gun?&quot;...&quot;A gun?&quot;...&quot;He should be wearing a gun. One of those things under the arm.&quot;...&quot;A shoulder holster?&quot;....even a worse coming next line: &quot;A hat would be nice. Hats are romantic.&quot; Well, my gentle and tolerent readers, all of them, again and again, just reminded me of that Crais and his created hero, Elvis(Grizzly?) Cole, are just a pair of wannabes of Robert B. Parker and Spenser. The professionalism in this book is so thin and far-fetched just like Grafton's stuff, but if Crais likes to be himself and not so pretensious, just let the story flow, his potentiality is still there. Crais should not try to be a Parker's wonnabe but a better Michael Connelly, or just wannabe one level higher than of a better than the author of &quot;MEG&quot;. Since Mystery stuff usually are all about homocides, murders, deaths, serial killers, kidnappings...and so on, that need a lot of persistent police and/or private detective investigations, and they are all about how to solve such cases, therefore, they are not funny at all in the least but solemnly serious. Trying to be funny in this genre is a deadly wrong and mi! sunderstood way of writing and marketing, especially for Mystery.	1998-05-06
US	51956980	R1WWWW2NMCY92F	0399143653	689118756	Guilty Pleasures	Books	1	0	0	N	N	A big question mark that never goes away	When I read this book, the first impression was this book was not written by the great Sanders. For years, I've remained one of the most loyal fan of Sanders, but when his cash-in books and some abslutely-not-his-creations gradually infiltrated under his great name, I've also become pretty devastated and estranged, but still tried everytime to get ahold of his new one first-handed. This one, a so pathetic make-belief novel by whosoever-Sanders-to-be, was indeed a last coffin nail to vaporize my depreciated loyalty to this old guy. The style, the writing, the.....whatever might be included were so un-Sanders from page 1, although I could live with some of the big-deal scenarios of incest that I could be more care less. The rich-girl-must-be-beautiful and the Great Gatsby prototypes in American bestseller culture are the worst garbage dumped on our poor readers/consumers. Why all the daughters from the rich families must be beautiful? Those rich buggers might be ugly merely married to beautiful women, but not necessary to just have one-sided gene of the mother and bear beautiful offsprings only. Bored-to-death lousy and plain story with a phony author's signature. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!	1998-05-02
US	51956980	R1LSBOBONCIZAH	068814988X	780258194	The Dinosaur Club: A Novel	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Heffernan was supposed to be good, but this one....	Okay, the problem might be caused that the author did not have too much experience in making living in corporate jungle, he could only use imaginary thought-to-be or scenes he saw from the big screen to make up the make-belief story. If Fallon realized that he's gonna be a pink slip receiver and tried to fight back with his old bunch in his sales department, he should take the fight from an urban guerrilla war angle, since he indeed has some experience with the VietCong. But instead sneakily fought back for his own survial and those of the others, he did things so obviously and so stupidly by sending all of them a T shirt printed with dinosaurs and wore them in the gym publicly; giving plastic dinosaur toys digged out from his garage. What's going on? Was he stupid or something? His divorce lawyer warned him not to have new relationship during a vicious divorce process, but he could not help asking Samantha to stay over the weekend at his house. Was he stupid or what? I've never read anything so one-sided like Fallon's daughter who seemed to lack of any common sense and only trusted her mother. Was this a 7-year-old girl's IQ instead of a college student? If Fallon was a smart guy who was smart enough to win the corporate war, he should do everything subtlely but instead he threatened the dry clean guy if they refused to fix his shirts' lost buttons, he would break their shop's windows. A guy like Fallon would never be impossible to survive the VietNam war thirty years ago, and definitely would not survive the purge of the corporte war thirty years later. A very very stupid and totally focusless novel except Heffernan's writing style. Going-nowhere plots and scenarios, half-developed characters and happenings, ridiculous and superfluous corporate probes. All in all, I just don't know why WarnerBro would pay $1 million for this lousy and boring story instead of stealing stories from the French. If I were one of the Hollywood movie producers, I'd buy Donald Westlake'sTHE AX, a novel with mor! e sense of America's corporate downsizing culture and how a 50+-year old guy to deal with it desparately, or, I'd invest money in Michael Moore's war of fighting back the crazy and heartless Downsizing trend in American.

US	51956980	R17207ZHGONLOH	039914370X	185941430	Sudden Mischief: a Spenser Novel	Books	1	0	1	N	N	Another loaf of bread soaked with tasteless water	It seems to me that Parker has lost the ways and means of continuing this series. Boring scenario, plotless plot, trying to be wisecracking but not funny at all dialogue with lot of short and single words such as &quot;Umm,&quot; he said; &quot;Yep,&quot; I said; &quot;Maybe,&quot; I said; &quot;Sure,&quot; he said; and lots of repeating of the upper line, such as &quot;Even if we don't,&quot; ...I said, &quot;Even if.&quot;  It also seems to me that Parker is an loyal oyster lover since he made Spenser and Hawk eat lot of oysters in this novel(shall we call it a short story, since the plotting and the wordings of it are both short and non-exist?) Some one may still fail to pull himself out of the extremely pretentious short style of dialogue created by Parker, but in reality, this kind of short dialogue might mean termination of any kind of relationships in marriage and friendship, since the two persons involved in speaking could not find anything meaningful to say but only short and pretentious and repeative words. By using a charity gone sour and Susan's ex hubby in this poor and tasteless novel only implied that Parker has lost interest in trying to make the Spenser series more interesting or transcend himself in writing a new one better than the formers but just want to cash in by his fame. There were so many moment that Parker showed the readers that he himself could not find where to go with this book: Page 156, Chapter 27, I was sitting in my office...trying to find a pattern in the matter of...(writing this story?) Making Brad Sterling disappear at 2/3 of this book and then let him appear in the end for a quickie round-up; making Gavion cry in Page 248 and simply said, &quot;I...loved...her.&quot; to save a lot of more complicated explanation which also made this encounter a most ridiculous fact: until Page 247, when Gavin asked Spenser, &quot;So what went wrong?&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe....&quot; It only means that until then, Parker still don't know how to final! ize this bored-to-death hollow story and &quot;Yes, that bothers me too,&quot; I said to myself while holding this heavy hardcover like Spenser told Gavin in Page 247. Also, by using heavy, thick paper and loose lines printing to balloon this (should-be-120~150paged) book upto a total 288 pages thick book, wasting a lot of trees, is also a shameless trick by the publisher who just want to heighten the selling price not by quality but quantity.	1998-04-20

Didn't know what this book was all about, just like &quot;Slow Motion Riot&quot;, the other book I really didn't know how to read on and get a grip, both are so pretentious, trying so hard to deliver something out of nothing. This book was so abstract, so bored and focusless that  made my eyes cross, like trying to get a grip from those framed 3D pictures sold in the mall stores, you have to look at it and not look at the same time, then you might get something figured out. The book is still on the shelf to torture me continuously.	1998-04-08
US	51956980	R1XGAPMONAZF7R	0345411447	209327852	Reign in Hell	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Readable but not as good as the two prequels	The first 1/3 part of this novel is quite promising and read like a powerhouse, but when the author tried to let Vail get involved the militia RICO case and in the meantime, tried to give his loyal readers a resolution of the bad and cunning A. Stampler and made him connect with the crazy militia extremists, the whole plot seems suddenly lost its powerful grip. If a RICO case was expected not to be solved within 18 months after Vail was sworn-in as Deputy A.G., the whole 2/3 part of its development read just like happened and resolved within couple of weeks, didn't look like it was evoked or solved by Vail but purely by the right(wrong) timing. Once any military operation launced, the scenario has become so large, so wide and lost its steam, and Vail has become a vague character instead of a well-focused center. If describing and/or portraying it just by quite a few (and quite tiresome ones) dialogue scenes of Vail's Wild Bunch, it was not a good way to satisfy a thinking reader. But in general, this is still a readable one and definitely better than other novels in the similar genra.   Anyway, I think the best excerpt digging out from this book's Book Three CHAOS is Pascal'S: &quot; MEN NEVER DO EVIL SO COMPLETELY AND CHEERFULLY AS WHEN THEY DO IT FROM RELIGIOUS CONVICTION.&quot;  Look around you now, what happened and is happening in this country is just like what Pascal said long time ago, in addition to the &quot;religious conviction&quot;, we should also add the &quot;self-righteous extreme right-wing conservatism&quot;. These two combined evil forces are now tearning our great nation and our book market apart.	1998-04-03
US	51956980	R2D95TDX9M7USA	0445405252	282618499	The Black Dahlia	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Very very good	Everything is fine with this great novel except the ancient editing. If this book could be reprinted and re-edited in a more modern form, not just jammed all the long paragraphs together in heavy blocks for easier reading, then it's not just very very good, it'll be PERFECT! And we also could find out tht Ellroy's writings in this book was quite normal, and then the great writer has found himself an unique and outstandging style in writing that evolved into the weird but more interesting form in his BIG NOWHERE and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. I think Mr. James Ellroy should get some literary awards if Faulkner could have some, since what he wrote is the real stuff of modern days.	1998-03-28
US	51956980	R3NA15GFVRDLU9	068814179X	148832051	Hit Man	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Not bad but this is not the cup of tea of Mr.Block	First of all, I'm a loyal fan to LB. So-- 1)This book, in general, is not a bad, but Block has wasted a lot of pages on Keller and his shrink and other irrelevant stuff that I have to leap forward to skip them; 2)Block should learn more techniques to portray a hit man's killing skills, not just by choking targets' necks almost all the time; especially Block has numerously described that most of the targets were huge, tall and sometimes, overweighted guys. It just made me wonder during the reading how he could have done it by just choking these giants? Maybe Block has watched too many WrestleManias, or what?  3)It has lost the steam after 180 pages, the final three chapters simply became the stamp collecting hobby report that Block might getting from his own recent newly pickupped interest. Interesting but I couldn't care less; 4)Basically, the new hero created by Block is quite okay but before formally being developed into a series, Block should do some more in-depth studies in this kind of specified profession in order to avoid more unprofessional weakness; 5)Block has provided us with some interesting killing scenarios but in the meantime, he also failed to give the reader a more satisfactory reading by omitting and/or skipping lot of details of such cases that he should described more clearly and more logically. But this kind of failure might be explained that even Block he himself could not find a way to explain how Keller did it every time. So, unless Block himself could find a reasonable way to let readers know HOWHEDIDIT, he should not just put many empty files with just file names but nothing in them; 6)Most important, Block should be aware more than before not to digress himself in writing since the age would become a bad factor more and more, and such problem would also inevitably appear more often and serious.	1998-03-28

Sorry, too ridiculous and outlandish.

For almost twenty years, this writer has used fomulated receipe to write simplified so-called thriller for simple-minded fragile readers to get goose bumps for no obvious reasons; if you feel like nail biting, contact your family doctor and elementary school teacher. All her books are almost the same; either still watching after twenty year since falling out of the cradle, or gradually turned into a typically formatted across-street scenario; somebody's still watching, but you could be pretending not seeing yet. Same formula like S.Grafton's books, when A to Z are used up, what's next? This one, as usual, a quick flip-through and bore-to-death read (sigh...)	1998-02-16

Since then, I've read all of DeMille's books, almost every one was good, especially his &quot;GOLD COAST&quot;. But then something happened, I could not put my finger on what and when, &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;, like Stuarts Woods &quot;White Cargo&quot;, suddenly, both writers turned tabloid and light-headed. &quot;Spencerville&quot; was just like an American edition of his &quot;Charm School&quot;, but the hero has become tired and spiritless, and then, a total falldown and a joke in &quot;Plum Island&quot;; very unbelievable characters, shallow plots and almost disgusting dialogues. Does age, richness or fame really kill a writer's heart?	1998-02-16

Woods almost turned a spy writer with this one, he also aped to become a horror writer with his UNDER THE LAKE, but he chose to write topics more secular and realistic. A most talented writer, readers should try his wonderful RUN BEFORE THE WIND and its sequel GRASS ROOT and so on until PALIMDROME.	1998-02-16

But why Amazon.com never included this wonderfully written book in their best recommanded 50 books?  If all the readers of Amazon.com uncontroversially and wholeheartedly said this book is GREAT and only gave a 10~10+, it IS great, OK?! And you don't get any special credit by just writing a shallow negative review.	1998-02-11

If the hero's nightmares become a unchageable format, he should not be able to have a new romance later. J.L.Bourke should give the hero and the reader a break, less nightmare and more normal life. A guy with so many nightmares consistantly experienced would result in asylum instead of in a bed with a new love. Basically, I don't think nightmares are a MUST or main part in this series, kind of bored.	1998-02-04
US	51956980	R1HNBM4L90EXFZ	0061010235	609655260	Veritas	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A most talented writer with larger-than-life ambition	What made me think during reading this book was that Victor Carl's eyes seemed to permanently recover from his old weakness, i.e., very easy to wet by other people's insult. But in this book, the hero seemed to become a totally different person, more attorney but less humanbeing. The writing was smooth and almost as good as Nelson Demille's &quot;GOLD COAST&quot;(but not his &quot;Plum Island&quot;--which was a nuisance and downride), full of witty sentences that made me smile. The plot was also fine, yet making the hero become a totally different person--althoght still craving success and richness--was a twist that the author should be carefully worked out in his next Victor Carl series. I strongly suggest Mr. Lashner to change to other venues of his 3rd-up novels, because talented as he is, he could write anything, any kind of hero or heroine as he choose and not necessarily has to stick to the complicated-yet-become-more-vague Victor Carl. To have such gifted new writer on the bookshelves is absolutely a blessing to our world readers.	1998-02-02
