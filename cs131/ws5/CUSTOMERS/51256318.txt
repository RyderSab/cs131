What do these 3 whiny selfish sisters have to do with Austen's classis sparkling comedy of manners?  Mrs. Bennett was neither cold nor bullying of her brood of British daughters?  The characters in Pride and Prejudice are likable unlike this horror.  I was delighted to pick this up, but it turned out to be so disappointing. <br /> <br />The sisters and their mother, \\"Doc\\". are so thinly drawn.  The author labels each one and we never see beyond that.  The mother was so exaggerated she could never garner any sympathy.  The men from the father to the assorted husband/boyfriend/fiance types were also like paper dolls, nothing was there.  I never cared about these people. <br /> <br />If you want a book about marriage and sister, reread Jane Austen!	2005-05-24

I read the negative reviews, but loved the description and bought it to read over the weekend.  I am sorry I didn't listen to other readers! <br /> <br />First of all Alex is supposedly so smart, but she sounds like an 8th grader or a Sweet Valley High character.  It annoyed me that she is earning an MA in Literature, yet you never know a single thing she reads or the topic of her disseration.  Such details would have made her a more real character.  I don't know why Crane avoided ANY specifics including the \\"good\\" school Alex went to. <br /> <br />The fact that the novel centers on pubs and consuming alcohol would not bother me if ANYTHING actually happened.  Alex wines to her annoying friends and drinks.  That's it.  For over 200 pages. <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this, but it was just tedious to get through.  If you want to read a well written novel about an academics self discovery read Gloria by Keith Maillard.  It is wonderful and has actual depth!	2004-10-20
US	51256318	R34NBVB6R5QKFU	031232118X	48498315	Something Borrowed	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Wonderful- do not dismiss this as &quot;chick lit&quot;	This is truly one of the most satisfying novels I have come across. In the aftermath of Bridget Jones there has been a wave of &quot;chick lit&quot; about bridesmaids etc.  This is not one of them.  This first novel is written with great grace and style.  I read it in two days and barely let it out of my hands in that time to see how it would al turn out.  It had a comfortable feeling too it- almost like a Judy Blume book for adults.  Characters that are realistic and with whom you can relate.<br />I loved the character of Rachel- a life long good girls who is put in a diffuclt situation.  Rachel enganders the readers' sympathy and reminds us that &quot;there are no moral absolutes&quot; that the lines of right and wrong can blur and that it is wrong to judge others.  It is also a story of taking chances and knowing that love usually involves risks.<br />I also enjoyed the cultural references to 80s fashions and fads.  She truly captures a gerneation x-er.  I couldn't help but love the reference to Don Henley's &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; sepia toned video.  One of my favorite 80s songs.<BR>This was excellent and I was so sad to finish it.  I plan to reread it immediately and cannot wait for more by this talanted author.  This is just wonderful!  Well worth buying!	2004-07-07

I discovered the legal thrillers of John Grisham along with most Americans in the summer of 1993 (when the film The Firm was released) and spent several weeks reading his forst four novels.  The best was A Time to Kill in which Grisham captured race relations in a small southern town.  I read each sucessive Girhsam blockbuster each summer.  Other than The Rainmaker I felt let down, some (The Brehtren, The Partner) were funny, but not truly cpativating novels.  After the King of Torts I was losing faith in Grisham- The Last Juror changed that.<br />This was fantastic.  It is admittedly a beach read, but seems more quality than most of this genre.  Grisham returns to smalltown Mississippi and describes issues ranging from lecetions, to the decline of the main street downtown, to race.  I could absolutely not put it down.  The characters were wll drarn and multidimensional.  It is not technically a thriller, but certainly held much suspence.  I hope John Grisham keeps writing like this!	2004-06-28

Pilcher's coming of age saga Coming Home is one of those &quot;desert isle&quot; books that I could read againa and again.  I wasn't sure anything else could be as good.  This is, just very different.<br />This is a reflective story of an elderly English lady looking back upon her life, her choices, circumstances in and out of her control, and those around her.  Each chapter focuses on a differnt character and their relationship to Penelope, the protagonist.  I assumer Penelope would be a typicla little old lady, but she has such depth and opinions of her own.  The book wanders around significant events in her life including the turbulent WWII years.<br />I was incredibly moved by the end of this book.  Without spoiling anything- the scene where her daughter finds the red drss in her closet brought me to tears.  This book celebrates love and life.  I adored it and know it will be one I reread!	2004-04-13

I loed that this fellow Long Island Girl turned her wedding into her own magazine.  Much of her wedding expertise and wit are in the last chapter of the book.<br />Her, wonderful, concept of being a princess is actually all about power, poise and self confidence.  There is nothing demeaning about it!  She argues that women need to take care of themselves to feel their best.  She also expresses the need for friendships among women rather than cattiness.<br />Her tips on finding a style muse are wonderful and something all &quot;profashional&quot; women need to consider.  This is like an etiquette book for the modern woman, but instead of stuffy manners she encourages women to just have fun and be themselves!<br />I read it from cover to cover the day I purchased it and have continually flipped throught it!  I hope Francesca keeps on writing!	2004-03-09

I read and enjoyed Fast Food Nation a few years ago and wanted to read more about McDonalds as a corporation that began quite modestly and is now an internationally recognized symbol.  This book while critical at times is far less disparaging than Fast Food Nation.<br />From a business perspective this book offers insight into managemnt, advertising, product development and expansion.  I admit I skimmed the long passages on fanchising.  The best parts are those describing the fateful meeting of the McDonalds brothers and Ray Kroc who took their idea of trasty, well produced fast food and spun into a national phenomenon.<br />I enjoyed the chapter dealing with how McDonalds made its foray into the international market as well as how new products were developed.  The best ideas came from the franchisees.  Kroc was convinced little poundcakes would be top sellers and also introduced a &quot;Hula Burger&quot; of cheese and pineapple ?!?  The idea of a chicken entree was oringinally to be a deep fried chicken pie and the mcnuggets began as onion bits deep fried.<br />It was interesting to read and I liked seeing the evolution of a corporation.	2004-01-28

The begining with the briefcase and the interruptions to present day are slow moving, but the love story was poingnant.  I found myself wishing that these two could just take the risk and be together instead of limiting themselves to a bittersweet reunion each year.  The characters were well drawn, but I just kept asking- Why can't they be together?<br />Probably best for fans of the Notebook and the rest of the genre.	2003-11-09

Conroy had even more books to read.<br />I was hesitant to read a basketball memoir, but this was much more. The sports motif was really an allegory of so much more. I learned a lot about the author's life, education and childhood. This gave me more insight into his other novels particularly Beach Music and Lord's of Discipline (both excellent).<br />This was so well written. Everything become lyrical when described by pat Conroy. He is so reflective, honest and insightful. I am not sure about the conversation between the author and the protagonist from Lord's of Descipline, but it was an interesting diea.<br />I had to go back and savor passages that were just so beautitful.<br />I loved it and thank the author for sharing so much of his spirit and craft!	2003-01-10

The character, Jane, was just too annoying- no wonder she couldn't find a boyfriend.  I give this two stars, because I did read it all, towrds the end I WAS skimming.<br />All Jane does is whine about her job- hmm she has an entry level position...don't many 20 somethings, her small apartment - it's NYC get over yourself.  Her wardrobe from Ann Taylor and Banana Republic- not exactly low end shops! She is downright nasty to/about her family and coworkers.  She has a real sense of entitlement.  I found it revolting that she only quit smoking for some guy not even for herself.<br />The ending was obvious, I think a book about the other characters might have been better.  I also need to add that the scene where she compares herself in Bloomingdales to Holly Golightly at Tiffany's was nearly offensive!  How did the editor allow shallow nasty Jane to be likened to the spirited Holly?!?<br />Skip it.....	2003-01-10

Of course it is not Grisham's usual genre- but it is a cute story that really put me in the mood for the holidays.<br />It was funny- the descriptions of upscale stationary &quot;boutiques&quot; and nosy neigbors are caricatures, but very funny ones.  Grisham captured modern America quite well.  He satirizes the cost and lack of meaning in too many Christmasses, realy making the reader think (while laughing).<br />The happy ending was truly heart warming not at all contrived.  Yes it does seem a little like a tv movie (W/Chevy Chase) especially when Luther finds himself hanging from the roof by Christmas lights, but you need a few of those moveis every year- they make Christmas waht it is.  I am glad that I ignored the negativity and read this.  It was fast- two sittings and very enjoyable!	2002-11-09

I only wish he had more books to read!<br />I knew that this was rough, Beach Music and others had prepared me to expect a harsh story.  I am amazed at how Conroy can describe atrocity and beauty with the same deftness and eye for detail.  Nothing escapes his scrutiny.  The story of four cadets was interesting.  I liked that the story is not told chronologically.  We are able to meet the characters and then see glimpes of their first year at the school.  The plot twists were wonderful and unexpected.  I thought I might have it figured out, but found a completely different ending!<br />This was one of those books which I had to force myself to slow down, despite the suspense and savor the writing.  I reccommend this and look foward to more Pat Conroy novels!	2002-11-03

I have read and enjoyed all of Maeve Binchy's novels and was lucky to have picked this up in Canada over the summer.  There is something welcoming and soothing about all of her novels.  This one pulls you into Quentins a chic yet cozy restaurant in Dublin.  I only wish I could go there and meet the people and try that wonderful food.<br />Like Scarlett Feather, Quentins celebrates the economic success of 21st Century Ireland, that is after the EU.  But this still has the warmth of her earliest novels.<br />I did find the story telling disjointed, but it still flowed.  My favorite parts were the short vignettes of patrons of the restaurant.  The story line of the missing money grew confusing and tiresone, but the on going story of Quentins si just wonderful!<br />I enjoyed this so much.  I do not believe that Maeve Binchy can write a bad book!  I plan to reread this again and again!	2002-10-31

I have to say that after reading the 2nd in the series, I know \\"get\\" why such a fuss has been made about Harry Potter.  I liked the first one, but this was truly masterful storytelling.<br />I really love the boarding school aspect to this series and enjoyed seeing the kids return for the 2nd year.  This time the plot centered around the dark froces at Hogwarts being unleashed from the Chamber of Secrets.  There were so many plot twists and surprises.  The author offers hints, there is really no wasted information in this story.

I really loved Bummer Summer and her other novels long before the Baby-Sitters Club (but I read about 50 of those=).  So I picked this up for sentimental reasons at the book fair at the school where I teach.<br />I was so impressed by the caliber of writing here.  Martin realy captured the voice of a rural southern girl in the 1950s!  The cadence rang true and was clear and honest.<br />I thought the story of rcaial tension in a newly segrated school was handled beautifully and might make children that age (5th grade) really think about prejudice and beliefs.<br />It was poignant, funny, sad.  Just a great story. I wish that it hadn't ended with the school Christmas pageant- I want to know how the rest of the year finished up!<br />This is well worth reading- for all ages!	2002-10-26

I am an 8th grade social studies teacher and have found this a useful classroom tool.  The kids have really gotten into performing these plays.<br />There is a nice range here- from Fort Sumter (which is great because it offers a female perspective) to Reconstuction.  The plays offer bits of insight into the human side of the Civil War as well as fun bits of trivia.  I needed a way to teach the Emancipation Proclamation and the Frederick Douglass play offered views from both the north and south as well as white and African American.  I am also happy to say that generally quiet students participate with the plays.  Some parts as quite large others just two lines.  This really works well with a mixed class and offers good \\"sparks\\" for wrap up discussions.<br />It was nice to see my students think about these people and events and even relate a little bit!	2002-10-21

I had the pleaseure of reading Beach music this summer and chose this becauce I had enjoyed his other book so much.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Conroy had an early career in education.<br />As an 8th grade teacher I enjoy reading books about others in education, but quality teaching stories are hard to find.<br />I loved this lyrical tale of Conroy's year spent teaching on a remote South Carlina island.  He faced immense challenges in this primative school, but loved his students and made a great impact on these young lives.<br />I found his stories both tragic and humorous.  Aternatley lauging and crying.  Conroy is a gifted story teller capturing the children, the island and himself woth poignancy and clarity.  This was delightful to read!	2002-10-05

I usually love long family sagas and had great expectations for Nashborough. This novel started out well enough, but I just skimmed the final third...<br />My main problem was that none of the principal characters were likable or even that interesting.  The sister, jasmine, who sleeps with her brother-in-law (all the while emphasizing the value of family!) critisizes her sister's wedding.  The family is rather cold amongst each other, yet places themselves above all others.  To them anyone else is an outider.  When an alcoholic brother leaves his young bride and their children they assume the wife must have been boring!?  What kind of family is this!?<br />Other than such meanness (clannishness they call it).  Not a lot happens.  This is surprising since the novel spans much of the turbulent twentieth century.  Major events such as WWII and the Depression are mentioned, but really do not impact these selfish people.<br />I wish this had been better.  By the way, Rona Jaffe's The Road Takes is a much more pleasant family saga!<br />This was simple mean spirited &amp; tedious.	2002-09-08

If you have read and enjoyed other MHC thrillers, you will certainly be unable to put this one down.<br />I liked that this had a supernatural theme and introduced the idea of reincarnation to the mystery.  Like her other novels this one has a young, strong female protagonist, lots of characters (almost too many), and moments of suspense.  I actually found some of the &quot;cliff hangers&quot; which end many chapters made me gasp out loud.<br />I have read all of the other mysteries and found this one deliciously spooky and suspenseful.  The last line alone sent chills down my spine.<br />I actually solved this one and enjoyed watching the mystery unfold!  Curl up with this- just not alone!	2002-08-26

Unfortunately, I found the book disapointing.<br />It is basically divided into 3 eras starting with the American Revolution to &quot;young America&quot; in the early 1800s to the Civil War.  What usually makes Jakes so talented is his ability to link generations for seamless story telling.  I really didn't find that here.  It was more like 3 loosely connected stories that did not relate the way they should have.  The novel was also missing a likable hero.  None of the family members were that pleasant and I found myself not really caring about them.  The book would have been much improved by having likable people!<br />The section dealing with the era preceeding the Civil War is well written and captures a divisive time.  As usual with Jakes, figures from US history walk across the pages (Frederick Douglass, the Grimke sisters).   I almost hope Jakes writes another book about this great city, but with a stong likable family.	2002-08-18

This is not a &quot;legal thriller&quot;  although I am not even sure what the term means at this point, with so many legal novels on the market.

I hope the author continues to write novels.<br />Stephen Carter is an expert at prose with vivid descriptions and realistic (often humorous) dialogue.  I loved that this novel is told in the first person Talcott was a very interesting character with wonderful observances of daily life.<br />The mystery was needlessly complicated at the end and a good 50 pages could ahve been shaved off.

The ending was lacking- I liked the plot twist, but found it a little hard to swallow.<br />This was fast, fun- definately one of Grisham's better novels!	2002-07-01

I did learn a great deal about the tidal water region of the Carlinas.  I liked how the book was divided into thirds.  I found the early settlement and revolutionary war eras the most interesting to read.  The women in these sections were passionate about their cause and facsinating characters.<br />For me the book fell apart with the final section- The Civil War era.  This surprised me baecause I love to study this time period.  I felt that the third story was rushed and simply borrowed parts from the other two with out true character development.<br />It really bothered me that the back of the book mentions the third women- Seleta.  Well the third heroine was Laurel (Seleta's mother).  This is so minor, yet I feel the publisher should have caught this.<br />I found the interspersed history lessons interesting and helpful, but the descriptions of native fauna got a little tiresome.  All in all, a partially good book	2002-06-26

Every description was detailed and fitting.<br />I loved the scope of this book- crossing across continest from Poland to Rome to South Carolina.  It spans 3 (4 if you count Jack's daughter) genereations and how each affects the next.  The beauty of the novel is the interlocking families, pasts, and hidden truths.<br />Conrad is a magnificent story teller.  The descriptions capture a sense of place and character.  But it is his conversational narration that adds plot.  The story is not told chronologically, but unfolds as we learn more.<br />This is a truly emotional story- in addition to love, friendship and hope there is abuse and despair.  A few descriptions are difficult to bear, but it all adds to a rich tale.<br />I just finished Beach Music, but am already to go back and savor it all again.  Find time to read and enjoy it!	2002-06-23

This is an addictive book- you cannot thumb through it without being amazed at the amount of neat facts!<br />My husband and I (both tried out Jeopardy as teens!) took it iwith us on a car trip and read aloud from it.  Where else can you find first lines of famous books, the original 31 flavors and the islands mentioned in Kokomo!<br />I love the little bits of pop culture- I always remember that the Facts of Life girls went to Eastland, but liked being reminded that Holden Caufield was booted from Pencey Prep.<br />This is great for a game show contest or just a trivia afficionado.

I love this author and cannot wait to read more of her Lowcountry tales.  DBF truly captures the beauty of the region and the lacal character.  Her descriptions are wonderful and her dialogue rings true (mostly).<br />That being said, I had few &quot;issues&quot;.  The main character, Caroline is not that likable.  I was disapointed that while she was devasted that hew husband cheated on her, she condoned the affair that her brother carried on....The treatment of her sister-in-law Frances Mae was really appaling. Clearly this family had great wealth, class and style.  However, ther were so snobbish to look down on Frances Mae because of her background.  When Frances Mae gave birth on the side of the road the first htought was of the disgrace she bought to the family, not sympathy for the poor woman.  I just felt that since Caroline was supposedly so lovely, she should have exercised greater compassion.  I also found the last hundred pages rather melodramatic and all of the voodoo stuff (in great detail!) got a little old.<br />As I said, this was worth the time to read and I lov ethe author.  Sullivan's Island was definately better!	2002-06-13

A story of bonding	I enjoyed this book so much and would love to read more about the irrepressible Ya Yas.  Wells captures the essense several different eras with dexterity.  She also creates a wonderful gang of characters with whom I feel as if I sat down to a tray of iced teas and pecan tarts.<br />My favorite parts dealt with the adventures of this close group of women.  I loved seeing the YaYas grow.  Some of their antics were laugh out loud funny- skinny dipping, others capture turmoil in America- racial issues at the premier of Gone with the Wind.<br />I definately preffered the scenese from the past to the modern day ones.  Vivi's daughter, Siddalee, just lacked the interest and spark of the older ladies.  It is not always easy to follow a book that is not written chronologically, but Wells allows us to draw conclusions and read between the lines.  The reader is always left wanting more....<br />This great novel is truly a celebration of female bonding and friendship!	2002-06-06

I loved this book and just ordered DBF's other novel and urge her to keep writing!  I don't think Sullivans Island left my hands for the couple of days that I read it.  I was so sad when it ended, having enjoyed Susan's trials and triumphs!<br />As with so many great novels, the setting is part of the story.  I now want to see the lush low country of South Carolina, ht ewatery imagaery is so appropriate to the story!<br />Susan is a likable heroine.  I enjoyed the alternating settings of 1963 and 1999- I always wondered what was happening in each.  DBF found a true voice for both of Susan's eras.  The other characters, her beloved Livvie and wise sister Maggie ring equally true.  I wish that there could have been a bit more emotion when she solved her father's murder.<br />This was an entertaing, emotional, and truly captivating novel!	2002-06-01

I was most impressed with Leamer's ability to fully chart the lives of so many diverdse characters.<br />I eagerly awaited the Kennedy Men.  If I had not read his previous work, this probably would have seemed better.  I felt that the Kennedy Women had a broader scope dealing with a longer (and earlier!) time frame and more individuals.  This started, really with Joe Kennedy and didn't focus on too many others.  A very minor complaint, is that the Kennedy women had a comrehensive time line in the beginning.  It would have been useful to include one here as well.<br />Otherwise, this is an extaordinarily well rearched volume.  What I enjoyed most was the conversational approach taken by Leamer.  It is a pleasure to read.  I wish that the final chapter \\"Requiem for a President\\" was slightly more detailed, but this was a chance to learn not about invididuals, but about complex family relationships and bonds.<br />I am glad that I read it and look forward to volume 2!	2002-05-29

Including the little anecdotes that make history fun, as well as some of the perspectives that we might not have learned in school.  I actaully read this before I started teaching social studies and am glad that I did.  This does not &quot;dumb down&quot; history, but refreshes the details of events.

I had purchased and enjoyed the first Cake Mix Doctor and was pleasantly surprised that this one seems even better!<br />There is such a nice variety of layer cakes, loaf cakes, cupcakes, brownies, even cookies and biscotti.  Just like the first book there is a small color photo of each recipe that really helps.  The author offers lots of advice (ie How to flod in ingredients).  I have made several of the recipes and have been delighted every time.  I made the Cookies and Cream cake for an adult birthday party and everyone raved about the results.<br />The cakes neither look nor taste like mix cakes, but have an old fashioned look of homemade to them.  Some of the recipes are very chocolatey, but there are many to please those who like other flovors as well!<br />This is also fun to just flip through!

But, it is not pure fluff- this one has real substance.<br />I found myself thinking about it long after.  The authors know Park Avenue and effectively satirize it right down to the tropm L'oeil doors.  The descriptions of these apartments/parties are worht the price of the book.  I understand whyt the protagonist is simply called &quot;Nan&quot;, but it made her too impersonal.<br />Seeing her relationships with the little boy she watches as well as his parents grown and change made for a book that I did not want to put down.  My (minor) complaint was the ending felt rushed and could have been better.<br />This was fun to read and I hope for more from this author.	2002-04-26

It actaully took three tries for me to get past the first couple of chapters.  I felt this was another retread of Gone With the Wind, rather than anything new.<br />I will admit that I finished the book and found it an ejoyable read, but had the following quandries about it.  The opening scene seems hard to follow and offers little character development.  It makes the book more confusing, rather than enhancing it.  The story was forgetable.  I had to keep remininding myself who the characters were.  Finally, Emma, the protagonist is simply not a likable individual.  I had little intesrest in her, did not feel her motivation was clear and founs her to be rather cold- not a heroine I enjoyed.<br />If you likes the business aspect try Jeffrey Archer's As the Crow Flies instead.  That is a far superior tale of one man's quest to create an ENglish shopping empire.	2002-04-22

I was disappointed in this book.  The Hudson Valley is a magnificent well for story tellers and I was excited to read about the generations who had lived in a single home and worked on its orchard.<br />This is much more a creative writing guide than a history of a house/family.  Philip spends chapters describing the writing process, but not enough about the actual home/family.  The writing parts would have made an excellent preface, but the book needed more substantative history.<br />Too often Philips interupts herself to backtrack to modern times.<br />This had great potential, but left me looking for another book.	2002-04-05

Please don't let that teen cover fool you- this is a beautiful love story for all ages<br />It is set in 1940s Wisconsin so parts are endearingly dated- getting cokes at the drug store, the family is very traditional.

I enjoyed the character of Paul Brenner more the second time around- Brenner has adopted much of John Corey's (Plum Island/Lion's Game) sarcasm and wry humor.<br />Much of this novel is a description of travel through Vietnam.  I do not see why this should be a complaint.  It is also plot/character development.  DeMille's personal experiences as a returning veteren shine through.  America's actions in Vietnma are important to current events today and Up COuntry really offers greater understanding.  This book brought the experiences of that place and era to light more than any other source I have come across.<br />The suspense plot does not falter and is expertly written.  Although Lion's Game remain's DeMille's best thriller Up Country is one of the best books I have read in some time!	2002-02-24

It was one of the sweetest, yet well written romances that I have read in recent years and was looking forward to continuing with the series.  The Macgregor Grooms was nowhere near as entertaining!<br />It seemed that Nora Roberts was following a formula and simply plugged in names in a set of events that varies only mildly from vignette to vignette.

The part where she is looking for background on the &quot;mysterious&quot; author of these letters is right out of Sleepless in Seattle<br />The suspense is non-existent.

Leamer tackeled an immense project by chronicling the lives of 5 generations of women and is met with great success!<br />It is not often that an author can find sympathy for both Jackie Kennedy and Rose Kennedy (the 2 women had conflicts and were quite different!), but Leamer allows both to be understood in new light.  My favorite parts were the ones that introduced the reader to JFK's ill fated sister, Kathleen (&quot;Kick&quot;) Kennedy.

Parts are fascinating.  The best section deals with myths that surround American Presidents.  Some are fluff, but neat to learn.  Lincoln hated to be called Abe!  Some of the information is things that most everyone has heard before- Lincoln grew a beard in response to a letter from a little girl.  Some of the information is dubious as well- Were the Adams' (JOhn &amp; John Q) REALLY the Kennedy's of the nineteenthe century. <br />My personal favorite is the section in which the author dispels the &quot;rags to riches&quot; myth with which so many preisents are associated.  It makes a great politcal story, but is rarely accurate.  As the author points out Lincoln was not wealthy as a child, but also not poor by the standards of the day.<br />The sections on sex, family, and education really offer a facsinating view into American past. In some segments the author seems to really struggle to uncover a &quot;lie&quot; he explains that Emma Lazurus' famous poem is in fact innacurate because the immigrants were not truly tired (!)<br />This was an entertaining way to spend a morning, but by no means a scholarly look at American history	2001-12-28

Homeland is just a much more broad sweeing epic with vivid characterization.<br />In Homeland we see the character of Paul Crown grow as an individual.  There is no such characterization here.  Fritzi is likable and intersting, but lacks the connection the reader will feel to Paul.  Likewise, Paul's other cousin, Carl seems so one dimensional.  Jakes make frequent references to Carl's clumsiness.  That seems to be his stand out trait.  Alot of the episodes here seem familair- the wealthy young woman with a forebodding father, Joe Sr's wrath at his children's careers/goals, a path of self discovery.  It is all the same as homeland.<br />Meanwhile the principal characters from that novel, Paul, Joe Senior, Ilsa feel like guest stars in a television show.  The younger generation is lacking somehow.<br />That being said, this is a good historical novel if you are interested in the turbulent years preceeding WWI.  I would have liked seeing more how Joe Senior (a native German) felt about the brewing winds of war...<br />This was disapointing, but not entirely w/o merit.	2001-12-06
US	51256318	RGZVR77Z8H1IB	1568362765	444196809	Teaching Stories	Books	1	11	38	N	N	Complete nonsense!!	I was assigned to read this waste of paper for not one, but two graduate school classes.  I even met Mrs. Logan and wondered how this women actually survived a real classroom where you are actually accountable for your actions.<br />I am a sucessful educator.  I know that my students enjoy coming to my class everyday.  Beyond that, they actually learn in my class.  Not fluffy, feeling things, but true American history.  My students do not spend each day writing stories and looking at fluffy clouds getting in touch with their inner children, but learning about the New Deal or the causes of the Spanish American War.<br />Mrs. Logan's students seem to spend all of their time sewing quilts.  That is fine, but teachers in the real world have a curriculum to follow.  She may dislike the &quot;big bad tests&quot;, but that is too bad.  They are a fact of life in schools across America- my principal expects me to prepare the student for those tests.  I would love to ask Logan's students questions to see if they know who JFK, FDR or Rockefeller are, but at least they know how to make quilts.<br />She advises new teachers to abondon the material you should be teachers to just &quot;chat&quot; with your students.  Hmm, is that why so many kids can barely read, forget about writing a resume or balancing a checkbook.<br />She also favors getting to know your students on a personal level.  I love my students, but am fine with the fact that we part ways at 3 pm each day.  She goes for ice cream with them and visits them at home.  The parents must love that.<br />The most appalling of these little vignettes includes an episode where a 13 year old student had her first menstual period.  Mrs. Logan, ever the fluffy sensitive teacher, throws the girl a special party.  Is that not crossing the line?  Is that even acceptable in any school in America?  Not on Long Island!<br />This is not a book for serious educators.  This is recommended by school of education professors who have no idea what it means to be a teacher!	2001-12-04
US	51256318	R16DFIC67NO0GO	0761117199	681264263	The Cake Mix Doctor	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Great cakes!	This is a fun cookbook.  I often look through it for ideas and am always impressed with Byrn's creatvity.  The ideas are unique and quite varied.  She offers tons of chocolate recipes, cheesecakes, cakes with fruit and a chapter of cakes (Such as Red Velvet that you might not make all of time, but are still intersting).<br />Every cake that I have baked has turned out beautifully.  There are photographs (albeit small ones) of every recipe that are quite helpful in assembling the cakes.  The instructions are clear and easy for bakers of all mastery levels to follow.  The chocolate cakes are very rich, but of course very tasty.<br />I wish she offred more variety with some of the cakes that a 13x9 pan.   I would like to see more than one way some of the cakes could be prepared.  Despite this, the cakes really are good and you would never guess that a mix was invovled.<br />The author inludes lots of sidebars that offer baking hints- very helpful.  I also likes the section about the history of baking mixes.  I think this book would be a great way to get kids hooked on baking as well.  I love this book and plan to buy the sequel!	2001-11-30

It captures Kennedy era culture.  I had no idea they created those hideous plastic masks of JFK and Jackie!  This volume is lushly illustrated with sidebars and smaller photographs as well.<br />I was sadden to realize that only Caroline remains of Camelot.  The last few pages- the saddest birthday remind us of the tragedy our nation endured.<br />This is great for kids and adults alike!	2001-11-28

This is a book that can be savored over a lifetime.<br />It shows the progression of Rockwell's art from his early, almost Victorian style covers, to his most famous illustrations, to his political portraits.  It always annoys me that people claim he is an illustrator, not an artist.  Simply because these pictures tell a story should not detract from their artistic merit.<br />This volume has them all.  From the beautiful, awkward, girl at the Mirror, Doctor's appointment and countless others that are not as well known, but still great!  So many of these paintings allow us to learn more about America (Can you get much more American than Norman Rockwell?).  His GI- Willie Gillis is truly everyman during WWII.  We seem enjoying a hometown newspaper, on leave, with his comrades, and finally as a student on the GI Bill.  So many ideas are timeless.  The chronicle of a day in the life of a boy or girl seem to embody childhood.  Commuters on a platform captures the rise of suburbia.  THe one of a son sitting with his father and dog about to leave for college captures that bittersweet moment on the cusp of adolescence.<br />The sunlit, yet dusty, Marriage Liscense is generally recognized as art, but others should be too.  I hope that with the recent Rockwell exhibets a new generation of Americans will appreciate this wodnerful artist who captured so much of our lives!<br />This is a great addition to any collection- you will never tire of looking through it!	2001-11-27

My mother read it to me so many times (well over 20 years ago!) that I memorized the text!  I loved cats as a child and was delighted with the story of Henry (&quot;One smart cat&quot;) shushing along the snow on skis and poles he fashioned himself.  The author tells the story so matter of factly that it seemed so real.<br />This is also a beautiful book to look at.  The water color illustrations of the snowy landscapes are very well done.  I remember this book fondly and look forward to sharing it with my own children.<br />A great story to read out loud!	2001-11-23

Jales told a really good story with excellent character development.  It is also the story of America in the 1890s and all the changes of that era.<br />The characters are well drawn and interesting.  I also liked that historical figures (Edison, Teddy Roosevelt, Clara Barton, Jane Addams) also wander in and out.<br />The story is mostly the experiences of new German immigrant, Paul Crown.  Paul is a truly interesting character and he really grows throughout the story.<br />I look forward to reading the sequel becuase I was sorry when Homeland eneded......	2001-11-22

Jeffrey Archer's most recent anthology of short stories is every bit as good as the three previous volumes!  Sometimes when I read story collections I will put a mark next to the ones that were particularly good.  There is no need to do that here since each one was excellent.<br />Somehow Arhcer manages to put great detail and life into each vignette!  There is always outstanding characterization, twists, and plot.  I have always felt the Jeffrey Arhcer is one of the most talented uathors of recent times!<br />Of the ones that stand out as true works of art are &quot;The Grass is Alwys Greener&quot; a poignant look at perception and envy.  &quot;Love at First sight&quot; is only a few pages long, but is so simply beautiful.  Each story is so good and memorable.<br />This is a great book with which to spend a Saturday afternoon.	2001-11-22
US	51256318	R166OND0VLQ8TS	0446360856	38570142	The Gold Coast	Books	5	31	33	N	N	The absolute best!	This is one of those books that stays with you long after you have read it, however I find myself rereading it every so often.  I catch myself making references to it and recalling favorite lines and scenes. <br />Gold Coast has everything.  It is suspenseful, poignant and surpisingly witty.  The protagonist John Sutter has a great dry humor that is actually laugh out loud funny.  It helps to live on Long Island and spot landmarks such as Hicks Nursery, CW Post College, and Oheka castle, but the themes are universal.<br />This is truly a modern Gatsby.  DeMille borrows imagery from that previous Long Island classic.  Most notably the hauntng image of a green light that represents all that could be.  I have read all of loved most of DeMille's other work (Lion's Game and Plum Island are wonderful action novels), but Gold Coast is truly literature.  The suspense growns and you wonder when Sutter truly got caught up in the world of the mafia.<br />The finely woven dicotomoy of two fading worlds is complex, as is Sutter's own growth in the spring and summer of his own diasastrous mid life crisis.<br />I recommend this book to every person I meet.  When I spent a summer working in a public library I asked countless patrons, Have you read Gold Coast.  I wish I could give it more than five stars as it surpasses every other book I have read!	2001-11-08

Her books are fast paced, suspenseful with wonderful characters that all interconnect.  I always take one of her books on vacation with me!  I have read and enjoyed them all.<br />This one was just a cut above.  She mixes more supernatural elements with her usual murder mystery.  The Cape Cod setting is extremely intersting- almost a character of its own.  Menley is a wonderful heroine that seems even more finely drawn that Clark's usual young protagonists.  There are really several interconnecting stories- all exciting and well written.<br />This is one of the few mysteries that I curl up with again every so often- definately worth reading!	2001-10-30

This is a great dessert cookbook for chocolate lovers.  There is a nice range of recipes from basic cookies and bars to elaborate cakes.  The recipes are clearly written and can create impressive results for bakers of all levels.<br />The pictures really inspire the reader to pick up a mixer and try the recipes.

This was a book with great promise that turned out to be highly disapointing!<br />There is nothing outstanding in this mundane collection of recipes that can't be found in an ordinary cookbook (Anything from Joy of Cooking to a Pillsbury anthology is just as useful).  The recipe for German Chocolate cake is available in countless other volumes and every grocery store.<br />I found the directions vague.  The interesting historical facts are fun to browse through, but the lack of photographs make this a difficult cookbook to enjoy.	2001-10-26

If you want to know the exact number lost at Gettysberg there are &quot;scores&quot; of such books on the market, such as Shelby Foote's masterful chronicle of our nation's bloodiest hour.<br />This short book presents topics ranging from the Presidents, the generals, African Americans, the soldiers on a double page.  The book is not written in paragraph form, but in a series of facts that have no connection from one to the next.  Some are quite intersting- Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were born about 100 miles apart.  This is fun for someone who already knows the basics of the war and enjoys ineresting trivia a la Cliff Clavin.<br />The thee dimensional aspect is what makes the book special.  I wish that more documents could have been included, but the author offers a nice variey of diary entries, photographs, and letters.  There is something special about holding two tickets for Ford's Theatre for that fateful April evening.<br />This is a nice addition to a Civil War library	2001-10-02

The cheesecake has become a New Year's Tradition.  In addition to great classic recipes like Pecan Pie bars there are many more modern/ trndy recipes- mocha tiramisu.<br />It is packed with great photographs and tell little anecdotes about the history of the Borden company.

If this book is required for a college class do not waste the money on it.  There is not a single useful piece of advice.  The author apparantly has never been in a real classroom or spoken to a real high school student.<br />His advice is condescending and just plain wrong.  The sample lesson plans are not practical for real life!  The author gives instruction that are simply contradictory to the real world.<br />This is one of the worst books that I have ever read.  If I could give it zero stars I would!	2001-09-18

I have always been interested in Long Island history and no one played a larger role in carving so much of its landscape that Robert Moses.<br />Caro provides insight in Moses' early years as an ambitious college student full of energy and ideas to spark efficiency and beauty.  Caro also deals with Moses' rise to power and actions taken with that power. Truly Moses had more say than anyone else in New York for a number of years.  The reader learns that Moses used this power both positively and nagatively.<br />We see a visionary who create a playground on the grandest scale.  Jones Beach IS the jewel of Long Island because Moses had the confidence to dream big (and leave his budget by the wayside).  The chapter of his discovery of making the beach a reality is just marvelous.  I will never forget the image of Moses walking on the deserted sand dunes dreaming of what could (and would) be. <br />Yet we see a very different man who willingly destroyed the pleasant community of East Tremont since it was in the way of his vision.  Care paints a picture that is both critical and respectful.<br />An interesting anecdote from the book.  Anyone familiar with the parkways of Long Island has likely wondered what Moses was thinking.  We learn that the man who designed so many of Long Island's roads never even had a driver's liscence.<br />This book is well worth reading, if the length seems daunting, you will be caught up in this great life story very quickly!	2001-09-17

This great volume includes the first and last editions of Leaves of Grass.  Whitman viewed his poetry collection as something that should grow and change with time.  Also included is his memoirs that show the Civil War through the eyes of a northern nurse.  This is truly a unique and insightful perspective.  His Civil War sensitivity comes across most clearly in the senstitive &quot;O Captain&quot;<br />Whitman's poems capture the momentum of life.  No other poem can touch &quot;There was a child went forth&quot; for capturing the spirit of childhood.  All stages of life are brilliantly illustrated here.<br />Whitman's life spanned such a unique era of American history and one cannot study the nineteenth century without reading Whitman.	2001-09-17

This diverse collection of poems is accessible for readers of all levels.  I have used the book with 7th and 8th graders, but am sure it would be fine for younger students as well.<br />The pages reproduce easily and clearly.  One side offers students background to that era or individual.  The author thoughtfully includes a vocabulary box that defiens words that your average middle school students might not know (ie Victory Garden, Tory, Jalopy).  The poems all have attractive illustrations.<br />The ones that have been successful in my classes are a poem that allows the reader insight into George Washington's thoughts upon his inaugeration.  The War of 1812 poem is a shenty in the voice of an impressed sailor.  I had my 7th grade class recite it aloud and I feel that it brought a difficult topic to life.<br />There are alos peoms dealing with Harriet Tubman, Civil Rights, The WWII Homefront, Ellis Island, the New Deal, Farmers' loneliness and the Transcontinental Railroad.  I always return to these worksheets again and again.<br />The new teaching standards encourage students to read documents and these are a great introduction.  I have used many of these poems as motivational activities.  This is well worth the money anda  great addition to American history lesson plans!	2001-09-15

It was interesting to see her early life on a farm and then the changes that came from her family's move to suburbia.<br />Cleary explains her early writing experiences explaining that she wanted to read books as a child that were realistic.  Her school and family experiences gave great insight.<br />This is also a great history of being a child in the depression era.<br />This is a great book for anyone who curled up with a copy of Henry Huggins or Ellen Tebbitts!	2001-09-14

The outsatnding research of this book can really be a wake up call to parents and educators.<br />Mary Pipher uses a variety of case studies to describe issues faced by girls of varying ethnic and socio-economic barckgrounds and one message is clear: It is not easy to grow up female in Amercica.  She discusses changes that need to be made in our school systems and at home.  Pipher offers valuable insight into what could be done to boost self-esteem of so many young women.<br />While this is usefull for adults, teenage girls will wnat to read this for reassurance that they are not alone and to realize that there are individuals and groups that want to help.<br />This is a meaningful book for anyone who cares about improving a difficult time in any girls' life.	2001-09-05

The brownies on the cover turned out beautifully. That is a complicated recipe, but it is broken into simple steps. Any level chef would enjoy concocting these creative recipes! I also had fun learning about the history of this famous bake-off. This cookbook is a nice addition to any kitchen!	2001-08-27

I have read a few of nora Roberts books before, but am not an avid reader of the genre. I like some romances, but find few with enough substance. I truly enjoyed reading The MacGregor Brides and plan to read the others in the series. The book is told in three vignettes each dealing with a reluctant bride. Each of the three youbg women claim that they have a career and don't need a mate. And each protest when their pushy, yet very well-meaning grandfather throws a suitable man in her path. It is formulatic, but that formula works. I enjoyed the middle story, Gwendolyn, the most. That was the most intersting; it seemed to build more of a relationship. This is a fun read- a good enough way to pass an afternoon or two!	2001-08-26

I like series, I like small town America, it seemed that this would be a perfect book to curl up with. I actually feel guilty that it just didn't grab me. The idea of a pastore in a town that feels hopelessly out of date sounds good, but Karon didn't quite pull it of. My biggest complaint is that it is boring. I just didn't care what happened. There was very little excitement, substance, or even plot to keep the story moving. It seemed that the general gist was that Father Tim wanders around town and then goes home. That's it. A disapointment.	2001-08-26

I have read all of John Grisham's previous work and knew that her decided to foray from his regular genre.  Truly, The Chamber and Street Lawyer were more moral tales than legal thrillers, but this newest book is not about lawyers at all.<br />The story is interesting and I like the idea of a child narrator, but it doesn't flow evenly throughout the novel.  Luke is supposed to be a 7 year old and comes across as alternately whiny and wise.  The book does deal heavily with the inticacies of cotton farming, but there needs to be more of a true story line.  It seems more a narrative of Luke's summer.<br />At the end I felt that not all of the issues had been resolved and that it just faded away.<br />It wasn't all that bad, Grisham obviously wants to prove that he is more than just Pulp Fiction, but this is not the next To Kill a Mockingbird.	2001-08-09

Siddons that I have read and I now plan to try her others.<br />She paints a vivid picture of small town life without making it streotypical or cloying.  The three main characters- Peyton, her father, and Nora all ring true.  Nora's motivation is a little hard to understand and she seems a little over the top, nonetheless she brings light into Peyton's life and into the novel.<br />Interstingly Nora, Nora frequently refers to To Kill a Mockingbird and Our Town and there are elements of both of them in her novel.  For example characters deal with racism and the single father is reminiscent of Scout's dad in Mockingbird.<br />This is a story of seeing and perception. The reader grows with Peyton as her view of her town, family, and herself are altered in this yesr of change.<br />This is an interesting story.  It seems short and I wondered what else will happen to these characters	2001-08-06

I had to read the book and was amazed that I enjoyed the novel even more than the film.<br />Her books have rich detail, great story lines (which often interconnect, realistic and humorous dialogue.  I had enjoyed her earlier novels whoch deal with young girls coming of age in 1950s rural Ireland. When she switched to more adult books (Evening Class, Tara Road) I wondered how I would like them.  They are every bit as enjoyable and this is no exception.<br />Scarlet Feather is entertaining, the characters are likable and have true depth.  I enjoyed that the each chapter is a month in the first year of a fledging catering business.  This story is told with more subtlety than some of her other novels and is wonderful.<br />I couldn't put it down and I was sorry when it ended and hope that the story of Tom Feather and Cathy Scarlet continues in the future	2001-08-04

I just got married 3 weeks ago and this book made the wedding planning process so much easier.<br />The advice on selecting vendors was practical and helpful.  She also offers advice on relaxing during those tense weeks beforehand. <br />Some of the best features are on suggested photographer shots, realistic ways to budget and save money, and incorporating cultural traditions.  <br />This guide should be the first on every brides list!	2001-07-31

The story seems to sparkle in the Dutch sunlight of the 17th century.  It contains the characteristics of many great works of literature- symbolism, foreshadowing etc, yet the plot moves along quickly.<br />It helps to be familiar with art of the era (Rembrant and others in addition to Vermeer).  This is a book that can be savored while the art brings it to life.<br />I also appreciated the description of various painting techniques illustrated by the author.<br />This is definately worth your time!	2001-07-26

A young woman (often alone) in trouble, too many characters at first, intersting connections among those characters and a good story.<br />This is one of the most enjoyable novels I have read in a long time.  The action moves the story along and the ending is a great plot twist.  I wish that it had not ended so abruptly and had explained the denoument a in a little bit more detail, however.<br />Any fan of suspense should not be disapointed	2001-07-24

I enjoyed this book! it is great summer reading- more substantial that you might expect, but just plain fun to read. The story spans the course of the twentieth century and I really enjoyed Jaffe's descriptions of each successive era.<br />This is basically a &quot;nice&quot; book- things work out, the family gets along through all their tests. I truly recommend this fun read!	2001-07-03

I am a teacher of American history and always like to learn more.<br />I felt that McCullogh offered interesting insight into Adams' early years and truly shared much of his personality in the first chapters.  The later chapters, particularly those of his presidency lack that familarity.  I would have liked to have known more of what Adams was thinking during his tenure in office and the years following.  I was surpirsed that so much of the biography focused on Adams' years abroad and his separation from Abigail.<br />I found his wife, children, and other supporting characters (including Thomas Jefferson!) offered much clarity on those first formative years of a tentative young nation.<br />This was well worth the effort it took to read!	2001-06-28

I loved Bridget Jones, but thought that this was a pale clone of Fielding's more interesting and intelligent singleton heroine.<br />The characters in this book are one dimensional and seem whiny. There are a few humorous descriptions, but I found this a tedious novel and did not enjoy it!	2001-06-26

Despite the lovely cover, this book was a let down	2001-02-10
