In the first one, the author provides a description of the allies and enemies of Egypt; this takes account of the Nubians, Libyans, Bedouin, Hittites, Persians, Sea Peoples, Greeks and Romans.  The next chapter depicts the numerous weapons, used in Ancient Egyptian times (such as maces, spears, axes, knives, bows and arrows), as well as the military equipment (shields, armours, chariots) and the materials (stones, flint, copper, bronze, iron).  The third chapter presents the 9 gods of war  Amun, Anhur, Bes, Montu, Ptah, Sekhmet, Set, Ra and the Aten.   Chapter four deals with the structure of the army, the training and work of a soldier.  It also informs the reader of the dangers and drawbacks in existence to a soldier.  The fifth chapter details defences, fortifications and siege warfare, while the sixth one gives details on the various battles and campaigns that took place from the Predynastic period to the Graeco-Roman period.  In the concluding seventh chapter, \\"The Legacy\\", the author argues that Ancient Egyptian achievements would surely not have been possible without the military.  The book contains numerous black and white drawings, photographs and maps, as well as an index.  Using archaeological evidence to back up his portrayal of the Ancient Egyptian military system, this is without doubt one of the most important works about warfare in Ancient Egypt.

The truth, however, is as astounding in its simplicity as  it is in revealing the sophistication of their belief structures. These  very scenes in fact provided the food and drink needed to sustain the tomb  owner in the afterlife. This book covers the origins of these models, from  their first appearances during the First Dynasty at Abydos and during the  Old Kingdom, down into their final demise during the course of the New  Kingdom.

It is a chronological study of the nw (translated as 'official gift' by the author), in which he discusses the  concept, the role, the uses and the administration of 'official gifts' in  Ancient Egypt, as exemplified in his introduction.

The book examines closely renowned Ancient Egyptian  books, such as The Book of Am-Duat, the Book of Caverns, and The Book of  Gates, with the express aim of providing the visual and textual backdrop to  the myths. Imhotep, the architect of the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser at  Saqqara, features prominently in the mythology of ancient Egypt. Hart  captures eloquently the life and history of Imhotep, as well as the  construction and perpetuation of his divinity status in later times.

He is archaeologically  concerned with the Arabian Peninsula. [...] The first chapter discusses the  geography of Ancient Egypt and particularly the influence of the Nile on  the developing civilisation. A brief outline is presented of the history of  Egyptology, with the main emphasis on Sir Flinders Petrie. The second  chapter deals with the typological industries preceding the First Dynasty:  the Badarian, Naqada I, Naqada II and Naqada III times. The discussion of  the concentration of sites, as well as the artefacts excavated, from these  periods is concise and informative. Problems creep in, though, in his  analyses of these artefacts. [...] The third chapter describes the  development of hierarchy through the Predynastic and the way it manifested  itself through societal expressions. Hierakonpolis is discussed in depth  and the origins of the ideology of kingship. The development of maceheads  and palettes are traced in parallel, as are the early tombs. [...] The  fourth and fifth chapters deal with the Third Dynasty until the end of the  Old Kingdom. [...] The final chapter deals with Rice's psychological mentor  - Jung. Jung himself expressed great interest in  Ancient Egypt, a factor  that heightens, in Rice's view, the validity of using Jung's philosophy in  interpreting the development of the Ancient Egyptians through  &quot;analytical psychology&quot;. [...] A lot careful and hard work has  gone into producing this very lucid text. [...] While there is much useful  information for both academics and interested scholars of Ancient Egypt to  take note, Rice's text is littered with factual errors which makes the book  problematic. The book should be read with a critical but open mind.&quot;	2000-04-26

The book also serves as a travelogue since  we follow Professor Schoch in his travels from the sandy deserts of Egypt  to the bottom of the ocean in Japan. This book does not answer questions  but makes us wonder. A definite must for all.	1999-10-03
