Hermux is called to the Varmint Theatre (to install alarm clocks in the dressing rooms), but soon finds himself roped into designing the stage set and solving a baffling murder mystery.  <br /> <br />As in previous volumes, the plot is engaging and the writing witty. Favourite characters from the first two books, (like aviatrix Linka Perflinger and beauty-product megalomaniac Tucka Mertslin), make a welcome return - and we meet a whole cast of colourful newcomers: Fluster Varmint the theatre manager, Nurella Pinch a mysterious aging film star, and a very peculiar ventriloquist. Hermux's pet ladybug, Terfle, also takes a starring role in the plot - and the touching relationship between mouse and bug is as charming as always.  <br /> <br />This is perhaps my favourite book of the three - but it also has to be said that some of the plotlines might perhaps be rather 'grown-up' for the very youngest: murder, love triangles, an unwed pregnancy, an abandoned single parent ... all softened under mouse-fur and whiskers, but there none-the-less. Such themes are commonplace in contemporary teen fiction, but surprising in anthropomorphic bedtime stories for the under nines - and at times seemed a little surreal. In all probability it'll go over the heads of most youngsters, and it didn't bother me - but some parents might want to read the story through first. <br />	2005-04-05

If you enjoyed `Time Waits for No Mouse,' then you'll love this too - and even if you haven't read about Hermux before, this is the kind of sequel that doesn't require an in-depth knowledge of the first book.<br /><br />Talking mice aren't to everyone's taste. In recent years, anthropomorphised creatures have become much less fashionable - but this book may change your mind. However, I think the cover-art on both books has let the author down, as the modern, stylised, garish pictures give no hint of the charm and whimsy within.<br /><br />The book is divided into many small chapters of 1 - 3 pages, which makes it the ideal bedtime story book. To ensure pleasant dreams, I prescribe one chapter before bedtime, to be taken every night until completed.<br /><br />May your tail grow long - and all your squeaks be little ones!	2004-11-07

If given the choice between the `Diary of Anne Frank' or the latest J K Rowling or Lemony Snicket, few children would choose the biography, despite it being an essential addition to their library. However, Roald Dahl's true-life stories of his childhood are the ideal cross-over, helping the young reader discover that truth can be as fascinating as fiction.  <br /> <br />As always, Roald Dahl's style of writing is highly accessible and great fun to read. Millions of children are familiar with his hilarious fantasy stories (Matilda, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, The Witches), so are more likely to read this slightly more serious book than they would other biographical material. Those who are interested in writing and have ambitions to become an author themselves one day, will be fascinated to discover the original inspirations behind many of Dahl's fantasy books. <br /> <br />`Going Solo', Dahl's sequel to `Boy' is one of the most gripping little books I have ever read - far more so than 'Boy.' I strongly recommend both books to children of all ages ... adults too. <br />	2004-11-06

It's a real page-turner; I couldn't wait to read the next chapter!<br /><br />As always, his style of writing is a pleasure to read, and although most younger readers prefer his macabre tales of fantasy, this is well worth adding to their Dahl Library.<br /><br />Both `Boy' and `Going Solo' are the perfect way to introduce the developing younger reader to biographical/true-life stories, rather than remaining forever stuck in the magical realms of fantasy fiction. This book can be equally enjoyed by young and old alike ... the sort of book a grandfather and grandson can read together!	2004-11-06

Although set in the past, and in a world that few modern girls can fully comprehend (slavery & piracy), the two heroines face many of the same issues that their readers also face.<br /><br />Although clearly a fantasy, the author depicts both the characters and the world they inhabit with skill and attention to detail. A slight predictability of plot is soon forgiven; when the journey is enjoyable, knowing the probable destination needn't be a stumbling block.<br /><br />Not a book for boys, as there are no real heroes ... only heroines! Recommended for young adult readers rather than girls below the age of ten; for younger readers try \\"Piratica\\" by Tanith Lee ... an adventure story with a similar setting/concept that takes a much more light-hearted and humorous route - yet also manages to give a more convincing flavour of a piratical life!	2004-11-05

In this version, Beauty is plain compared to her two elder sisters ... and the beast is more sad and mysterious than frightening or beastly.<br /><br />Closer to the original French fairytale than any version so far, the style of writing has an old-fashioned charm and simplicity about it, giving you the feeling that you are reading a letter from Beauty herself describing her life at the beast's enchanted castle.<br /><br />This book would make a wonderful gift for girls aged nine to ninety!	2004-11-05

This is an intriguing and well-crafted book, neatly divided into three acts, each divided into three parts which are each sub-divided into three chapters. The setting is a world similar to our own but with some subtle differences, not least of which is that the majority of pirate captains and highwaymen appear to be young girls!    The story begins with the 16 year-old heroine, Artemisia or Art for short, suddenly recovering lost memories of her childhood; a childhood spent at sea with her mother, pirate captain Molly Faith. She leaves her prim, suffocating girls' school behind and sets off to find her mother's old crew and embark on an adventure of her own. However, her recently retrieved memories are not quite as reliable as she thinks!    My admiration for this book grew as I read it. For the first three or four chapters (setting scenes, meeting characters) I was only mildly interested, but once Art discovers the truth about her memories, I was hooked. By the end of the second part, I came to regard the characters, (Art, each of the pirates ... even the parrot), with affection, really caring about what happened to them. By the third part, the adventure becomes a real page-turner.     Art isn't simply the standard feisty heroine, but an oddly noble girl, determined to follow her star ... whilst continually bewildered by enigmatic (possibly false) memories of her childhood. Her romantic interest, Felix, is also no stereotype ... and for much of the book it is difficult to understand his true motives for joining the pirates. The book's conclusion is both dramatic and satisfying, holding your attention until the very last page.    There have been several pirate stories published of late ... also the film, 'Pirates of the Caribbean'; however, this is without doubt my favourite. Although more fantastical and less grittily realistic than some books, it cleverly manages to convey a much more convincing flavour of life at sea.	2004-11-03

Now the royal family send four islanders to rescue their son: An elderly wizard, a magical fey, an invisible ogre and a young hag. Unfortunately, the now nine-year-old prince doesn't want to be rescued. <br /> <br />The writing is a sheer delight, describing the fantastical characters with such charm that they are easy to visualise and become utterly believable. This book is perfect for 8 - 9 year-olds to read on their own - or would make a great bedtime story read nightly to 6 - 7 year-olds. It's exciting, magical, mysterious ... but best of all, there's nothing too frightening and plenty to make you laugh out loud! If you're an adult analysing the narrative for subliminal messages then you're missing the point - This is entirely and purely for the entertainment of young readers.	2004-11-03

I have not been a fan of the `Sabriel' series by Garth Nix. I found their preoccupation with death a little morbid for my tastes. However, I recognised a considerable story-telling talent, and suspected I would really enjoy this author with a different subject matter ... and I was correct. <br /> <br />This is a magical story, equally suitable for either boys or girls. Magic is not used arbitrarily as a convenient flash-bang solution for every problem, as is so often the case in this genre, but rather, requires logical application by the central character. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the uncertainty I felt with many supporting characters in this story, never entirely sure until the final pages exactly who could be trusted. Nix has managed to avoid creating people who are stereotypically either good or bad. We may doubt the motives of those who appear good, and forgive the actions of those who seem evil, once we learn more about them. The hero makes wise decisions - but I wouldn't be at all surprised if they came back to `bite him' later in the week! <br /> <br />The plot is well-paced, gripping and full of surprising twists and turns. This is an adventure as exciting as you could wish for - and never predictable. However, I did feel one particular scene might be rather nightmare-inducing for the youngest readers - so recommend this for the ages of 12 and above.  <br /> <br />If you didn't like 'Sabriel' - don't be put off; give Mr Monday a try. You won't be dissapointed!	2004-11-03

This book starts with possibly the most clich&eacute;d opening sentence of all time: 'It was a dark and stormy night.' However, the story that follows is both original and charming.<br /><br />Meg and her younger brother Charles Wallace go in search of their beloved missing father, whose experiments have left him trapped in a parallel dimension. With the help of three mysterious witch-like characters they tesser (travel through a wrinkle in time) to rescue him, but face many dangers and adventures along the way.<br /><br />Both Meg and Charles Wallace are endearing multi-faceted characters. I especially like the fact they are considered to be below normal intelligence by the educational system, yet undoubtedly have much higher IQs than their teachers. Both show the rare insight and depth of understanding granted to few ... and recognised by even fewer. This is a wonderfully empowering message to young readers who are made to feel less than adequate at school. The writing style has a clarity and simplicity that makes it a pleasure to read. Recommended for readers aged 8 - 11.	2004-11-02

Sound familiar? It probably does; after all, this is a well-worn concept. In such an over-worked genre, this book needed some fresh or unique twist to set it apart. Unfortunately, although it is charmingly written it doesn't offer the reader anything they won't have read scores of times before. <br /> <br />Although a lengthy book, (300-ish pages), this is definitely a story for pre-Harry Potter-readers ... probably best suited to those no more than 8years of age. Young readers who have mastered the complexity of a Rowling's plot might possibly find this a little juvenile for their tastes. Adult readers will doubtless find it tedious in the extreme.  <br /> <br />The story is nicely broken into lots of short chapters making it perfect to read to little children at bedtime, inspiring pleasant dreams of dragons, unicorns and flying carpets. However, a very deliberate message of 'tolerating those who are different' may go over the heads of the youngest, or seem a little heavy-handed and 'preachy' to the oldest.  <br /> <br />In summary: an enjoyable fantasy book for young readers ... pleasant enough to read, but lacking the originality and individuality needed to stand the test of time and become a true classic.	2004-11-02

However, some of its strengths are also, perhaps, its weaknesses.  <br /> <br />The story is told from two very different viewpoints: Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimaeus a 5,000 year-old djinn (a good scrabble word). Bartimaeus is a witty raconteur, and tells his first-person story in a style reminiscent of P G Wodehouse, complete with hilarious footnotes. (In fact, the two main characters often reminded me of Jeeves and Wooster - a know-it-all servant frequently rescuing his hapless young master). Unfortunately, the djinn's sense of humour makes Nathaniel's chapters (told simply from a narrator's viewpoint) seem to drag a little in comparison.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, Nathaniel isn't always the most likeable of heroes - though his human flaws are sometimes a refreshing change from some young wizards. However, the two main characters' uneasy relationship is what makes the book really work - especially as Bartaemus is no stereotypical sidekick; it is impossible to be certain precisely where his loyalties lie (apart from with his wickedly self-obsessed self). <br /> <br />The writing is a sheer delight. However, I began to wonder whether this was what kept me turning the pages, rather than the plot. The plot itself worked well, but at times suffered slightly from a rather too feeble villain. Simon Lovelace (even his name is feeble) is certainly no Voldemort. I await the second part of this trilogy with anticipation. With a really dastardly villain and a few more twists to the plot, Mr Potter could find himself with some serious competition! <br />	2004-11-02

When the dashing aviatrix Ms Perflinger leaves her travel watch to be repaired, Hermux finds himself thrown into more adventures than he could possibly have imagined. <br /> <br />All of the characters in this book are mice - but not living beneath the floorboards in human's houses. No, they inhabit their own beautifully detailed and believable mouse world. The characterization is delightful - and although aimed at young readers, will appeal to many an older reader with a taste for whimsy and anthropomorphized stories. The plot is a kind of 'whodunit' - and requires the reader paying close attention if they are to solve all the clues.  <br /> <br />The book is divided into lots and lots of mini-chapters - some no longer than a page or two in length. This makes it the ideal bedtime storybook for reading aloud to little sleepyheads! <br />	2004-11-02

Any book that holds my attention to such a degree that I read it in one sitting certainly deserves that, despite the fact that towards the end I started to lose sympathy for the narrator. <br /> <br />However, many people mistakenly feel this is a chidren's book. Although the text is clear and simple, this is NOT in my opinion a book  suitable for a child; young adults yes, but not children. The bad language and profanities throughout the text make it unsuitable. I lost count of the amount of times I read the 'F' word and worse (often several times per page). The reason is that the narrator's mental problem means he remembers everything he sees/hears in detail and repeats it verbatim. Doubtless, kids hear language as bad, and worse, every day at school, but that doesn't automatically mean that responsible parents want them reading it at home.  <br /> <br />Don't let the bright childlike cover-art, or the fact it is frequently seen displayed beside Rowling and Snicket, fool you into thinking it is suitable for ages 12 and under. If you are the broad-minded parent of a precocious child, then go ahead; however, discerning parents may wish to check this book out BEFORE ordering a copy for a child. I feel it only fair to make this clear. After all, television programmes that use bad language before 9 pm are obliged to broadcast a warning beforehand.  <br /> <br />This is already a best-selling adult book. Children aren't children for long, they can always read it in a year or two.  <br /> <br />I know many will not agree with my opinion, thinking my view is outdated or narrowminded. Most people who take this stance are not parents themselves - perhaps they'll see things differently as and when they are! My intention is to provide parents with the facts ... it is up to each individual to judge whether this is something they want for their children or not. <br />	2004-11-02

Thimbletack their house-boggart has fallen out with nine year-old-Jared because he refuses to give him Arthur Spiderwick's old book containing the truth about the invisible faerie world - only now, it isn't invisible to the Grace kids any longer. A hobgoblin spat in their eyes, giving them 'the sight,' and now they see magical creatures that are invisible to their mother and everyone else. This is perhaps as well, as Jared's twin brother Simon is looking after an enormous injured griffin!  <br /> <br />The old house that the Grace family live in belongs to their Great Aunt Lucinda - locked away in an insane asylum for refusing food and claiming she is fed by faeries. Jared realizes that their mad relative isn't perhaps as insane as people think - so he, Simon and Mallory visit her, to ask her advice about what they should do with the Field Guide. But when they return home they are in for an unpleasant surprise. This time their adventure involves a phooka, a unicorn and some beautiful yet sinister elves. <br /> <br />These little books are like something from a bygone era. The writing is a delight - but it is the illustrations that make them truly special. They are amply illustrated with fabulous 'Arthur Rackham' style pictures that will delight children from 8 to 80.  <br /> <br />This book is the third in a series of five - about the strange, magical, and decidedly dangerous inhabitants of the invisible faerie world that surrounds us.

During a fencing match, while their 13 year-old sister is fighting a duel, 9 year-old twins, Jared and Simon spot someone rummaging through her sports bag. Jared goes to investigate - but finds something he never expected - a shape-shifter impersonating him, turning the Grace twins into triplets! As a result, he is expelled from school - but that's the least of his worries - while he and Simon are distracted, Mallory is kidnapped. A trail of mysterious clues lead them to an old Quarry inhabited by dwarves. Here they find the incredible Ironwood Tree - and to their horror discover their sister asleep, locked inside a glass coffin. Somehow they have to rescue her, escape the dwarves, their mechanical dogs and a giant ogre.<br /><br />This book is the fourth in a series of five. Although the stories revolve around the magical inhabitants of the faerie world - don't assume that these books are just for girls. Jared, the main character, is very much a boy - into fighting, getting expelled from school and generally being difficult! Even the faeries are not the twee Enid Blyton variety - neither are they the like the feisty gun-toting elves of the Artemis Fowl books. No, they seem much more realistic: Strange, magical, dangerous and willing to do anything to get Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide. What is it about this innocuous looking old book that drives the inhabitants of the faerie world to such great lengths. Book five - 'The Wrath of Mulgarath' has the amazing answer ...<br /><br />I have always awarded 5 stars to the previous Spiderwick books. However, a slightly disappointing ending meant that this one got 4 stars. I felt the denouement was below par - and rather rushed, as if the author felt obliged to conclude the book within the customary 7 chapters, when it might have worked better with an extra chapter or two. The conclusion seemed overly convenient, especially the unconvincing way the robotic dogs were dealt with and the Grace kids escaped the quarry. That being said - it's still a most enjoyable book.

Jared and his sister, fencing expert Mallory, set off to rescue their brother - but they are in for a few surprises along the way - including a troll, a friendly hobgoblin and a gigantic griffin. <br /> <br />For those unfamiliar with the series, these 5 little books are a real retro-style treat to the eyes.

As you are no doubt aware, \\"The Supernaturalist\\" is the latest book by Eoin Colfer. I won't bother with a synopsis, (you can read Amazon's own above - no point in reiterating it here). Let's get right to the point. If you're an Artemis Fowl fan and haven't read it yet, then the question you'll want answering is: is it as good as the fantastic Fowl series? <br /> <br />The answer is not a simple yes or no. The most honest reply would be to say that it is entirely different. For a start there's absolutely no magic - it's more science fiction, (though science fantasy would probably be a more accurate description). However, like AF it's full of futuristic high-tech gadgets and is incredibly imaginative and witty. There are plenty of laughs, thrill, spills and impossible adventures to keep you turning the pages, long after midnight! <br /> <br />Speaking personally, I didn't find Cosmo - the main character - as compelling/unique/vibrant as Artemis - but clearly Colfer is going for an entirely different protagonist here. He's far more the hapless under-dog than the wise-cracking evil genius. Supporting characters are fun, but I failed to bond with them - though the Bartolli baby (a 28 year-old man in a 6 year-old body is an imaginitive creation and great fun). The style is very action/comic book - and as ever the dialogue is superb. <br /> <br />So, dear Artemis Fowl fan, should you splash out on a copy or not? The answer is an unqualified YES. A great book, well worth reading - just be sure to approach it with an open mind, knowing it's taking a different (and at times slightly more mature) tack. Don't expect another Artemis ... just enjoy it for what it is!  <br />	2004-10-31

There is something almost Victorian about the quality of their presentation. Beautifully designed covers, outstanding illustrations and a watercolour frontispiece piece all help conjure an aura of days gone by, when faeries were the standard reading matter for the young. <br /> <br />The writing has a clarity that will suit young readers whilst not being overly simple for slightly older readers. The vocabulary is good, but not off-putting for those still feeling their way through books alone. Pages are small - less than half the amount of words per page found in a standard children's book, enabling younger readers to really feel that they're progressing.  <br /> <br />Each book is divided into 7 chapters - making it ideal for a week of bedtime stories. Furthermore, what really makes these little books special is the stunning quality of the line illustrations. The artist dedicates his work to Arthur Rackham - and it is clear that Rackham has been his inspiration. There is hardly a double-page-spread without some little picture and there are plenty of highly detailed full page illustrations too - yet again making it perfect for bedtime reading. <br /> <br />Although the style of the books is intentionally retro, the story is anything but. The plot of the first book: 'The Field Guide' revolves around the three Grace children; nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon, and their older sister Mallory. They move into their Great Aunt Lucinda's derelict house - and soon discover that it is not quite as empty as they thought. While trying to trace the source of the mysterious noises within the walls, Jared discovers a strange hidden room in which he finds an old hand-written book belonging to his long-lost Uncle, Arthur Spiderwick, which contains the terrible truth about the faerie world. Once he opens it, his life will never be the same again. <br /> <br />This book is the first in a series of five. Although the stories revolve around the magical inhabitants of the faerie world - don't assume that these books are just for girls. Jared, the main character, is very much a boy - into fighting, getting expelled from school and generally being difficult! Even the faeries are not the twee Enid Blyton variety - neither are they the like the feisty gun-toting elves of the Artemis Fowl books. No, they seem much more realistic: Strange, magical, slightly dangerous and determined to stop at nothing to protect their world and reclaim Arthur Spiderwick's powerful book. Subsequent stories include a whole menagerie of mystical beasts, including: goblins, griffins, unicorns, boggarts, ogres, dwarves and elves. The Spiderwick story continues with: Book 2 - 'The Seeing Stone' <br />	2004-10-31

Garth Nix has an amazing imagination (the story contains a gigantic creature mutated from someone's lost eyebrow), and he has created an impossible yet believable world peopled with vibrant three-dimensional characters. Arthur, the central character, continues to charm - ably assisted by the delightful Suzy, and not so ably assisted by the 'Will.' <br /> <br />So why, when I gobbled my way through 'Mr Monday' in less than a day, did I find myself plodding through 'Grim Tuesday' over an entire week? The answer: I found it rather formulaic and episodic. Oh yes, there's a great cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter - but the protagonist usually overcomes the obstacle within the first couple of pages of the next chapter, then marks time until the next chapter-ending cliff hanger. Lots of little story arcs - but not really any decent or challenging big ones. <br /> <br />The resolutions were just too darn convenient and required little thinking or effort on the part of the characters - and as such they did little to grow or develop throughout the narrative. For example: at one point they're stuck on a sort of glass pyramid whilst under a hail of fiery missiles. However, the creature they just happen to have with them just happens to have a glass-cutting diamond hidden in its mouth. Aarghhh!!! This kind of convenient resolution occurred with such regularity, that I no longer cared about the plight of the protagonist - certain that whatever tight corner he found himself in, he'd overcome it a page or two later with the minimal of mental effort. <br /> <br />That being said, it's still a jolly good book. If, like me, you've read the first part and intend to keep on reading until Sunday's book - then it's a must read. Really sorry I couldn't give it 5 stars!I liked it - but it just didn't have the class of 'Mr Monday'. Here's hoping 'Drowned Wednesday' will be a return to top form! <br /> <br />	2004-10-31

At first I wondered whether a book about trolls would be something I'd like. However, I was pleasantly surprised - and found I enjoyed it thoroughly. The fantastical creatures of Norse mythology are a refreshing change from the characters found in most contemporary fantasy. Troll Fell is set in a world where trolls are as common as mice - though considerably more dangerous! <br /> <br />The story begins with young Peer Ulfsson at his beloved father's funeral. Finding himself now the obligatory orphan required for most children's fiction, he goes to live with his two unpleasant uncles: Baldur and Grim. They live in an old watermill at the foot of Troll Fell - and soon put Peer to work, treating him like an unpaid slave. Fortunately, Peer has his faithful dog, Loki, with him - and soon makes friends with Hilde from a neighboring farm, whose father has just sailed off on a Viking ship. He also befriends a Nis - a mysterious little creature who cleans the mill, (badly), in return for a daily bowl of groute, (a sort of Norse porridge). Peer also makes the acquaintance of Granny Greenteeth who lives in the millpond, waiting to drag the unwary down to the bottom. <br /> <br />As if slaving for Grim and Baldur isn't bad enough, Peer soon discovers his uncles have more sinister plans for him; plans that involve making a nefarious deal with the trolls of Troll fell. I'll say no more - leaving you to enjoy this beautifully crafted tale for yourself. Suffice to say it all ends well, with a twist or two along the way. An excellent first novel - hopefully the first of many. <br />	2004-10-31

Surely this was just another Harry Potter clone, I thought. But no - this is a truly excellent little book, which seems to have been somewhat overlooked amidst the recent hype over other less well written children's novels. The pacing is brisk, the characters are well drawn and the multi-stranded plot will keep you guessing to the end. Furthermore, it couldn't be more different than the Harry Potter novels - yet is certain to appeal to many young readers in exactly the same way.  <br /> <br />The story starts aboard a train, where Joe Binks finds himself in a carriage with some rather odd people; one of them plants something on him, then manoeuvres him off at the wrong station. Unaware of what he's carrying, he stumbles upon a coven of witches, and meets Twiggy, a teenage apprentice witch who helps him solve the mystery he finds himself suddenly embroiled in. It's lots of fun and there's plenty of clues and shoals of red herrings along the way! <br />	2004-10-31

I've read every one of the Series of Unfortunate events - and certainly had no intention of missing this episode. However, I was slightly disappointed with the book this time.     The story is reasonable enough by Snicket standards - but we learn little of any real value to further the ongoing plot or get answers to any of our questions (though an intriguing new character is introduced on the last page). It rather felt like `filling in' until the final book or two. Normally, with the witty narrative and dialogue, that wouldn't have been a problem - but there were several things that made this book somewhat irritating to read:     1) New character Captain Widdershins says `Aye,' after almost every sentence - 8 -12 times every single paragraph of dialogue. Then as if that isn't enough to, his niece starts doing it too.  2) There are several (intentionally dull) double page segments about the water cycle intended to lull the reader to sleep to avoid reading any further misery; it's only funny the first time, by the fifth/sixth it's a nuisance.   3) Count Olaf has a new and very annoying way of laughing, saying things like: Hee hee hee sniggle haw snaggle heepa heepa ho ho heffalump ... after virtually every sentence. Esme does it too.   4) Carmelita keeps telling everyone she's dressed as a `tap-dancing ballerina fairy princess veterinarian'; funny a few times then it starts to grate.   5) There's an enormous amount of plot exposition woven in which seems unnecessary; if you've read all the other books you already know this stuff, if you haven't, you shouldn't start by reading part eleven of a series anyway.     All that being said, if you're a die-hard fan eager to read this series through to the end, then this, of course, cannot be missed. But speaking personally, it's my least favourite so far ... and just seems to lack the originality of the early episodes. It makes me wonder if stretching this tortuous tale in to 13 episodes is perhaps stretching it a little too far	2004-10-31

If you are addicted to Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, then the tenth addition to this thirteen part series is a must have! If you enjoyed the early books but found the last few somewhat formulaic, then I still recommend Book the Tenth!  <br /> <br />After countless tantalizing hints and suggestions, we finally get some real clues. Without giving anything important away, I can reveal that information is uncovered concerning whether or not both Baudelaire Parents really died in book one's fatal fire (hinted at in the last book); we draw much closer to finding out what the initials V.F.D. mean; we are reacquainted with at least two characters from the early books; and a hitherto missing person makes an astonishing appearance subsequently shedding considerable light on the tragic events blighting the Baudelaire sibling's lives. Furthermore, although you won't be able to read about it (for reasons of privacy), Violet has an unexpected romantic entanglement in a very cold place! <br /> <br />The last book left readers with a cliff-hanger: Sunny had been abducted by Count Olaf and his entourage and was being driven uphill, whilst Violet and Klaus were rolling downhill in an out-of-control carnival caravan. If that sounds bad ... then be warned ... things get much worse! If you enjoy cheerful books about mischievous elves, talking mice, magical spells and soft, fluffy teddy bears, then don't order this book - however, if you like alphabetical pledges, snow gnats, trained eagles, mysterious hidden letters, and find vicarious pleasure in the misfortunes of others (an expression which here means you like laughing at luckless orphans), then this is the book for you.  <br /> <br />Finally, the obligatory dedication to Beatrice is the funniest yet! <br />	2004-10-31

At a time when many children's authors are jumping on the fantasy bandwagon and producing clones of existing popular books, this weird tale comes as a refreshing change.  <br /> <br />The story is a surreal one; imagine 'Alice through the Looking Glass' with a contemporary twist, written in a style that makes the dark humor of Roald Dahl seem tame by comparison. Coraline lives with her parents in one half of a block of flats; the other half is empty and the door connecting the two is bricked up. However, one day the bricks vanish and Coraline finds her way into a parallel world that mirrors her own, but with some very, VERY disturbing differences. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have grumbled about lack of depth to supporting characters - but I think they are missing the point. This book is quite short, (largish print) and no time is wasted on superfluous details about Coraline's neighbours. The emphasis of their characterization is on dark humor - all we really need to know are their peculiarities and foibles to appreciate their skewed mirror characters in the alternate world Coraline gets herself trapped in.  <br /> <br />I like children's books to take me somewhere new, unique and different - and to give me a few laughs along the way. This book certainly gets into my top ten favourites, despite being like one of those hideous nightmares that you can't seem to wake up from! <br /> <br />If you enjoy something dark and different, check out 'Speed of the Dark,' by Alex Shearer. <br />	2004-10-31
US	36339267	RO7BVNMRLP1L0	014131706X	499666777	Blood Red Horse	Books	3	12	14	N	N	The Tale of a Crusader's War Horse	I had been looking forward to this book - despite reading about it in one of the most scathing newspaper reviews I've ever read. I'm glad that I did read it, because I have come to the conclusion that the reviewer was most unfair. It suggested that this book was written as some kind of comment on parallel wars being fought in recent times. Knowing the timescales involved in writing and publishing, I knew this was impossible - but I was curious to see what kind of slant the author had put on the history of the Crusades. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the view presented was impartial and balanced. We learn about this historical event from both sides: from King Richard and his men as well as the Sultan and his Saracen army. <br /> <br />The story is well written and has a definite sense of period - yet without resorting to 'olde worlde' dialogue that would swiftly weary the reader. The three main characters: Will, Gavin and Ellie, are well drawn and have real depth. The reader follows their growth from children to young adults. As they age it becomes ever clearer that there is a romantic triangle of sorts here - Ellie is clearly attached to Will, yet must marry Gavin the oldest. How their emotional stories progress (whilst together and far apart) really holds the story together.  <br /> <br />Despite its merits, I felt the story had a few flaws that kept it from being a truly perfect children's novel. It seemed to have a very slow start; on a number of occasions whilst reading the first few chapters I was half-tempted to abandon the book, as it seemed rather pedestrian and dull. I also found the earlier segments about the Sultan and his son distracted me from the story of the three main protagonists, and felt tempted to skip them. I pressed on, however, and gradually my affection for the story and characters grew.  <br /> <br />Bizarrely, I found the least well-rounded and convincing character to be the 'Blood Red Horse' himself. I never truly understood whatwas so very special about 'Hosanna' that captivated everyone who came into contact with him. Apart from his attractive appearance, ability to move well, and a certain steadfastness - I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. I read continually about how everyone utterly adored him (to the rather uncomfortable point of idolization), including the entire Hartslove estate, King Richard, and the Sultan's son. Yet despite this, I couldn't see one single heroic deed or action that prompted their devotion - and as such, I never really bonded with the horse or cared enough about it, in the way that I did about Will, Gavin and Ellie. True, at one point he stubbornly refuses to join in with a mass slaughter - but this subtle distinction of what was honorable seemed unconvincing, especially when he played an active role in many other bloody scenes.  <br /> <br />When first told of this story, I had understood that it was a story about the crusades as told from a horse's point of view - so I kind of expected a historical 'Black Beauty.' Sadly, this was not the case. For me, the central character of Hosanna has practically none of the emotional impact of Black Beauty, because we never really get to know him, his thoughts, feelings, etc. This is especially unsettling when he seems to switch his allegiance midway and focus his affections on the Sultan's son, with little evidence of missing his previous owner. This may be how a 'real' horse would behave perhaps, but for me, this central character just didn't work in the way he should. Maybe if we had 'heard' from Hosanna (got inside his head), this story might have had a real emotional impact and might have become a true classic instead of a rather standard historical adventure with a horse that everyone obsesses over thrown in for good measure. Perhaps it all works so much better for lovers of all things equine - but the gruesome deaths of so many of the other horses (though historically accurate), might be distressing.  <br /><br />A sterling debut novel - but it could have been so much more! <br />	2004-10-31

However, I will try to make my comments as helpful and balanced as possible - fully aware that many may well disagree.<br /><br />When I read that this book had been written by an Author aged fifteen (when he started), I approached it with enthusiasm - and an open mind. Surely, I thought, for it to get published, it must be way beyond the talents of most young writers. In many ways it is; I certainly cannot imagine many people of that age having the patience to write something of this length. So, five stars for effort!<br /><br />However, I have not awarded this book five stars. Why? Well, although an excellent effort for one so young, it undoubtedly reads as the work of an immature writer with much still to learn ... and when I pay good money for a book, I would prefer not to be reading someone's apprenticeship material, no matter how valiant the attempt. There are countless other reviews all saying the same kind of thing and quoting specific examples of immature writing style - so I won't bother to do the same. I just genuinely wish I'd taken notice of them, instead of being lured by the marketing - and a nicely illustrated front cover.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, this young man is a bookseller's/marketer's dream. In interviews he comes over as intelligent and engaging. And this is, at least partly, what is helping to sell what would otherwise be a rather amateurish and overlong book. At several stages whilst reading, I tried to analyze how it got as far as publication. I later learnt that this was initially a vanity publishing project (self-published), and after an enthusiastic response (probably as a result of vigorously publicizing the youth of the author), a legitimate publisher bought the rights, (no doubt thinking they might as well have the profit as the author).<br /><br />Now I understood. There is always a problem when this situation occurs; it is usually published by the new publisher in its original state - rather than having the enormous benefit of a thorough editing. Tightening Eragon by about a third could have worked wonders alone - but that would be just the beginning. Considerable improvements are needed with regard to plot (too dull and predictable), pacing (waaaaay too long and slow), characterization (too many characters distinctly two-dimensional) and lacking originality (nearly everything in this book has been done before by somebody else - and done far, far better).<br /><br />No doubt, the next epistle in this series will be a huge improvement. The young author will hopefully have developed and honed his craft - and a second book will have the benefit of the editing process. But meanwhile, if you're thinking of buying this book here's my advice:<br /><br />If you are the type of reader who when offered an epic meandering tale about knights and dragons, will cheer, grab it with both hands and gobble your way through it - no matter what the quality; then go ahead and buy it - this book is for you. However, if you are a discerning reader with limited time, then I heartily recommend buying something else (preferably shorter). There are plenty of debut novelists out there who have spent many years honing their skills before expecting customers to part with their hard-earned cash; try one of their books instead.er than having the enormous benefit of a thorough editing.

I'm happy to report that I found it to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read for years.  <br /> <br />An adult J K Rowling novel is, to my mind, a description that does the book few favours; I would describe it as a Jane Austen with magic. The style of such writers as Austen and Thackeray is captured so perfectly that it is hard to believe that this is not a 19th century book, but one from the 21st century. Using this device makes the reader feel that this story has been part of our British literary heritage and, as such, seems to turn it into an instant classic. Clarke creates a world that is entirely believable. Weaving the plot around historical figures (Wellington, Byron, Mad King George) added a sense of reality to the magic.  <br /> <br />The story revolves primarily around Gilbert Norrell and his gifted pupil, Jonathan Strange. They are both multi-faceted complex characters, and, in many respects, I was constantly wondering which of them was the so-called bad magician, and which the good - as with real characters, they are neither entirely black nor white! Apart from the two main protagonists, the story is packed with wonderful characters, my favourtie being Stephen Black (Lord and Lady Pole's Butler), who is befriended by a strange faerie gentleman anxious to grant his every wish.  <br /> <br />The scale is immense and the pacing somewhat measured - but I enjoyed it all the more for this, as it felt like a book I wanted to savour rather gobble. I didn't want it to end. My only criticism is that it's just too big and heavy to read in bed!  <br /> <br />	2004-10-30
