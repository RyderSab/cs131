US	52601178	R1QAE8UH2ZL82P	015602943X	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Worth reading but over-hyped, self-absorbed	The story was good enough and I developed enough interest in the characters to read this through to the bitter 500 page end. But, it's nowhere near the quality that the gushing reviews here and elsewhere would have you believe.<br /><br />The writing alternates between the points-of-view of Clare and Henry. The Clare point-of-view seems real enough to me most of the time, but I'm a guy so what do I know about that. I would say Clare sometimes uttered words or thought things that I thought were shunned by real women and reserved for porno characters. It seemed like a cheap way to inject pseudo-reality into some sex scenes and didn't work for me, especially with this \\"artsy\\" character. On the other hand, Henry's point of view seemed very fake to me, clearly written by a woman who isn't that in-touch with many men and a deep personal level. Henry seems most real in dealing with his father and his daughter, but we see far too little of those characters.<br /><br />The emotions are overblown at times, making me think the author thinks she's the first person every to explore themes of loneliness and waiting. Stylistically the writing reminded me of the written equivalent of 90's grunge music: angst-ridden, self-important, woe-is me.<br /><br />The writing is also slow and flowery to a fault most of the time. The characters think and talk in several foreign languages and routinely quote great literature at length. Maybe people are like that in the circle of fine art fiends the author teaches, but it struck me as just elitist. And every time Clare launched into a page long description of making paper, paper texture and color, it was a signal for me to skip ahead a few paragraphs.<br /><br />At times she does break out of the angst and self-pity and celebrate the glory of living every moment, and enjoying your blessings, not taking anything for granted.<br /><br />There were discussions and descriptions of miscarriages that were too disturbing for me. I thought it was fine to use that topic and the plot surrounding it was well done, but I thought the author crossed the line into the grotesque in dealing with the physical descriptions.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the time travel angle is less than unique and not original. Vonnegut did it better in Slaughterhouse Five. In a different genre, time travel as a human physical condition has also been explored more uniquely by Dan Simmons in Hyperion (including the attendant pain suffered by the loved ones of the time traveler).<br /><br />I always made a point of avoiding any book Oprah recommended for her book club. No matter how interesting it looked on the surface, I knew better. I let my guard down a little and didn't notice the \\"Today Show Book Club\\" endorsement on this one until I was a couple hundred pages in. I'll know better next time and watch for that book club endorsement as a red flag.e plot surrounding it was well done, but I thought the author crossed the line into the grotesque in dealing with the physical descriptions. <br />As other reviewers have noted, the time travel angle is less than unique and not original.

So, who am I to think it's so bad? No one really, I have no education, training, or specialization in any of the areas discussed in this book so maybe the problem is me, not the book. But, the book is billed as if written for laypersons, not experts in the field. So I'm more the audience than Dr. Watson, and I found it lacking. <br /> <br />I have no idea id any of Hawkins' theories are correct or not. Having read the first half of the book though, Hawkins had failed to offer any proof that any of his theories are correct. He beats them to death with some analogies, repeats conclusions from hypothetical experiments as if they have been laboratory tested, and then moves on to build on this very shaky foundation. About half way through the book when I realized that he was done laying the foundation, wouldn't offer any proof, and was now squarely in the middle of building his conclusions, I put the book down. <br /> <br />While the book may be important in terms of forward-looking hypothesis, it doesn't do anything to support the claims the author is making. It's as much science fiction as science, as it's all speculation, little proof. <br /> <br />I did skim to the end to find the appendix that in my mind, really proves my dissatisfaction with this book is well-founded: \\"Testable Predictions.\\" Until some of those tests can be performed and prove or disprove his theories, this book is premature. Unlike a theory in another scientific discipline (physics for example) if the theory can't be backed up experimentally, there's got to be some good grounding to prove it and rule out other theories from another standpoint (in the physics example, a theory has to work mathematically to be worth experimental testing). In his theories, there is no other outside frame of reference given to try to prove them.	2005-04-01

Some of his later stuff (Fierce Invalids from Hot Climates, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas) fails to recapture the early magic. Or maybe I'm just getting to old for this.

Ender's Game, 2001, Rendezvous with Rama, Stranger in a Strange Land. If you've read and enjoyed any of those, you owe yourself a read of A Canticle for Leibowitz which fits that mold. At times the pace is slow (comparable to 2001 in the respect), and it's definitely the darkest of this cluster of greats (save the ending of Ender's Game). <br />This may not be for everyone.

Anyone who readers it more than once after college needs to step back and get in touch with reality. It's great fiction and timeless. But despite Rand's attempt to shape the world in this mold, let's be thankful her philosophy never took hold. <br />If you read this in high school or college, you can be excused for buying into it briefly. Give yourself a year or two of growing up outside academia, and you'll grow out of the philosophy. <br />If you are an adult just curious what the phenomenon is all about, you might want to read a Cliff's Notes version instead. Otherwise, it's hard to justify putting yourself through something like the 70 page monolog in here.	2005-03-19

Beta 2 (which there's a good preview available of as of March in the form of a new \\"community technical preview\\" on MSDN) should be close to the final feature set developers will see when ASP.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 finally releases. So, beta 2 is now a good point for developers to get familiar with ASP.NET 2.0 in preparation for final release. <br />Given that the point of ASP.NET 2.0 is to build data-driven sites, Kauffman's database-centric book is a good way to look at it. <br />The most important change in beta 2 is ASP.NET 2.0's new ties to the \\"SQL Server 2005 Express Edition\\" product. This is detailed well in one of the early chapters here. <br />After that the author covers all the routine ASP.NET data techniques you'll need to know including: <br />Displaying data <br />Paging and sorting data <br />Filtering data <br />Updating, deleting, inserting data <br />Working with XML	2005-03-19

Starting during a time when a plague wipes out the populations of most Christian countries, the world is repopulated mostly by Buddism and Islam. The book follows the reincarnations of two main souls throughout many reincarnation cycles. In some they are peasants, others warriors, sometimes merchants, others great leaders. Between each cycle there's a brief interlude where the souls look for each other in limbo before coming back into their next earthy existence. <br /> <br />I can't remember reading anything quite like this before and I really enjoyed it. In addition to the alternate history, there's great emotion between the main characters throughout al of their many lives. <br /> <br />I will say I thought it went on a little too long. By the last 1/3 of the book and the last several reincarnation cycles, I thought all that could be said had been said and I was relieved to get to the end. But even that doesn't detract from an otherwise great novel.	2005-03-19

Duggy, the title prince of thieves, and his band of childhood friends turned bank and armored car robbers are believable. If you grew up in a subdivision, their complex relationship with their neighborhood may seem a little alien. <br />Most of the thieving plot, from the big bank heist, to the first armored car job, to the big finale armored car job seems believable. <br />But, Duggy's love interest in Claire, a bank employee and kidnapping victim is implausible. Her returning the interest in him, even when she begins to suspect he was involved in her kidnapping (an event that left her emotionally wrecked) stretches any hope of believability beyond the breaking point. Add in the primary FBI agent on Duggy's case having his own crush on Claire, the victim/witness, and we've got a completely unreal love triangle. <br />The book has a satisfying dark ending. The last paragraph tries to wring out some philosophical truth from a thief's death that just doesn't fit with the rest of the book.	2005-03-19

That was a great column 15 years ago, he showed a very human side you didn't get from many other computer pieces. The column was long and winding, intermixing life and whatever computer toy he was playing with. <br />So, recognizing his name I picked up this book. What a mistake. I'm sure there's a market for this branch of sci-fi, but it isn't me. This is space opera at it's worst, pure silliness. What Heinlein saw in this to give the endorsement on the cover of the edition I read, I'll never know.	2005-03-19

There are 5-8 good stories here, which makes it worth reading. Most of the others are easy enough to ditch quickly that you know within a page or two whether or not to continue. And, the better stories are in the \\"people together\\" section which is the first part of the book. It mostly goes downhill after that. <br />The same ones other reviewers here have called out as good I'll mention: demolition derby, amateur wrestling, castle building were the highlights. Juliette Lewis and Marylinn Manson (excuse me if I haven't taken the time to learn to spell that name right) are the memorable lowlights. There were other more boring stories but those two stood out as bad. <br />BTW, if you have any aversion to porn or obscenity, skip the first story but don't pass on the whole book because of it. <br />	2005-03-15

So I picked up Camouflage based on that reputation. I don't think I could have been more disappointed. This is derivative to the nth order. First there's the mysterious impenetrable alien object. Shades of 2001. But it's under the ocean. So that makes it somewhat of a Sphere rip-off too. Complete with aliens. <br />But these aren't your ordinary aliens. These are sexual predators (that is what you would call someone who tricks someone else into sex under false pretenses), into sex with humans, and who participate in some of the most gruesome human experimentation in human history. They can also take any form they want, again, useful for tricking humans. This sounds like a job for good old James T. Kirk and his intrepid ability to bed every alien shapeshifter in the galaxy. <br />If you think Kirk is a well-rounded character and him in bed with aliens is the high-point of sci-fi, adjust my rating to 5 stars. Otherwise, this is an easy book to skip if you've read 2001, Sphere, or probably countless other alien artifact books. <br />	2005-03-09

It deserves discussion along with Ender's Game, 2001, and maybe 2 or 3 others as candidates for the best of all time. Its effect on our culture is obvious, with \\"grok\\" becoming a word most people now recognize. (An Amazon search reveals nearly 400 other works that use the word \\"grok.\\" How's that for influence.) <br />Like most of the more in-depth reviews will state this, this novel is really like a play in two acts. The first half of the book is a masterpiece, and what places it amongst the great works. The 2nd half bogs down and meanders though. The first and second halves are different enough to make you think it's really two different stories. <br />Without debating the merits of the themes on love in the 2nd half, the second half still would have been improved by a tighter focus, doing more with less. <br />The first 1/2 of the book is the greatest couple of hundred pages of scifi ever, nothing compares. The 2nd half brings it down a little to the level of a few other greats, but it's still in select company. <br />Everyone should read this. SciFi fan or not. I hope that one day it will be core reading for most 20th century literature courses, and included with great works outside of the scifi genre.	2005-03-05

Time Enough for Love though is boring and for me, was unfinishable. The back cover of the edition I have states it is his \\"longest and most ambitious.\\" Well, in this case, length isn't a strength. In fact, even in Stranger in a Strange Land (Heinlein's greatest story and arguably the best SciFi story ever), the story loses its way 1/2 way through. Shorter would have been better in both cases. <br />True scifi and Heinlein fans will need to read this anyway. I'd suggest a steady diet of caffeine to make your way through it.	2005-03-05

But then, that's fair because The Runaway Jury doesn't say anything that Grisham hasn't said before. My wife used to pick up these Grisham books, and because I'll read almost anything once, I'd read them when she finished. I enjoyed the first couple a little (The Client, The Chamber - I'm sure those weren't his first, I don't follow him closely enough to know his complete list in order). But this one was the one that finally convinced me I needed help. After reading this, I joined a Quit Grisham 12 Step Club. And with a little help, I wake up every day and resolve \\"I will not read any Grisham lawyer stories today.\\" Some days it's difficult, I think I may have backslid once when I was out of work. <br />But you can have the same reading pleasure I've found by promising yourself to avoid Grisham until he invents a new character, new story. There's a whole world of deserving novelists out there. He isn't one of them. This book isn't worth reading. if you've read The Firm, The Client, the Chamber, The Partner, etc, there's nothing new here for you.	2005-03-05

I was on the way back from a trip, at the airport in a hurry to catch a flight. Wow, a Grisham story not set in a court. I bit. <br />No having cracked the book in the store, I didn't notice until I was buckled in that the font size qualifies for a first grade reader or \\"large print edition.\\" Don't be fooled into thinking it's 240 pages worth of writing, it's more like 1/2 that, had the type been a normal paperback novel size. <br />The upside there is, you only get stuck with 1/2 the clichs, 1/2 the transparent cookie cutter characters. 1/2 the unbelievable plot. (A championship-loving H.S. football coach hits a player in the locker room 15 years ago. Sure, I'll buy that but I won't buy the fallout, that the player and coaches have a falling out. Football is about hitting. A player dies in the heat of summer practice and the coach gets fired? OK, Bobby Knight got fired for less but he hadn't won 15 consecutive championships or whatever this character supposedly won. No, this would have been more akin to firing John Wooden after his 10th NCAA championship.) <br />Here's advice I never thought I'd give: thinking of reading this? Rent a movie instead. Go rent Hoosiers (or buy it, it's worth keeping). <br />John Grisham, make me a promise: you don't try to write any more sports stories, and I'll keep not reading your lawyer gunk.	2005-03-05

Otherwise, you'd probably never be lucky enough to find this rare treat. I first read Replay several years ago, on the way back from a trip, picking it up at the airport. It looked like the kind of throw away pulp I needed to relax in the back row. <br />And while it was a light and easy read, I could have never guessed how much the story provoked me. The theme of \\"getting a 2nd chance to do it all over again\\" is certainly not uncommon. But Grimwood's characters, especially the main character Jeff, are real, believable, and easy to relate to. The struggles Jeff goes through to \\"get it right\\" the 2nd time, and then a 3rd time, and many more times after that run the gamut of vices and redemption. <br />Although I finished it on the plan trip as planned, I didn't chuck it in the trash on the way out.

He should write more. The First Immortal and The Truth Machine are both good enough to give him a lasting place in any SciFi collection. <br />There are many novels dealing with consequences of immortality. I couldn't say if this is one of the best. What I do like in it are the realistic characters and real debates arising. In fact, although published in 1998, Halperin does a great job predicting exactly the kind of family legal battles over cryonics that would erupt 4 years later when baseball great Ted Williams died. The characters, the family involved, and their relationships and reactions are very believable. <br />More than a story about immortality and medical miracles though, it makes you think about the value of each day you have, relationships with your family, and questions about what growing old really means.	2005-03-05

Of the two, I probably prefer The Truth Machine. Is everything he describes in this book plausible? Probably not, but if you can suspend disbelief just a little, you should enjoy this. <br />The book centers around one man's invention of a perfect lie detector, eventually made so small and imperceptible that every person everywhere can always have on a wearable version. The overriding themes are the effects that not being able to lie have on society and humanity, with people eventually forgetting how to lie and never even thinking of lying as an option. A little farfetched? Maybe, but still a good story. <br />The story follows Pete from his youth through adulthood, and his development of the truth machine. More important than the societal effects of not being able to lie, and what really makes this novel great, are the themes dealing with Pete's lie, the age old debate of ends justifying the means, and the question of punishment. In these respects, it bears striking resemblance to Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" (one of the top sci fi books of all time). Halperin did a great job of dealing with some of the same questions Card addressed but in a different and original setting.	2005-03-05

As he's grown a little older, he now asks for it as the \\"balloon book\\" because of the bright red balloon that appears on several pages. <br />I expect the older he gets as he learns to appreciate the humor, this is a book he'll treasure for years. <br />I was first introduced to this book by a long time friend who had it for his first son. I read the book to his son years ago when visiting, and my friend remembered that and got me a copy when my son was born. It's the kind of book that is that memorable and makes that kind of impression.

In this heavily footnoted book, she outlines numerous problems in the industry, congress, and regulatory agencies as well as some steps to correct the problem. <br />Some of the criticisms she levels are: <br />The drug industry claims to just be benefiting from the free market when in fact it benefits from enormous taxpayer subsidies from research and generous tax credits for R&D making the free market arguments spurious.  <br />The patent office awards drug patents of dubious value. This argument is much bigger than just the pharma industry, as anyone who has followed the software industry and ridiculous \\"business method patents\\" such as a method for one-click ordering on web sites knows the U.S. patent agency isn't equipped to serve its constitutional purpose on most technical patents. <br />Drug companies have far too much control over the clinical trials prepared for FDA approval of their drugs, biasing the results, designing studies to deliberately not find side-effects, and failing to show that new drugs out-perform old drugs. <br />Doctors and medical institutions are too \\"in bed\\" with their pharma reps, accepting bribes and kickbacks disguised as educational trips and consulting fees. <br />Congress for the last 25 years has been too friendly to the pharmas and created the legislation that spun this situation out of control. <br />She makes her case very well, if all of the data and sources are real and representative. I have read other reviews here criticizing her data though and have no doubt that wherever possible, she has chosen the data that while correct, contributes the most to her cause even though it may not be representative. In that respect, she may be no different than many of the one-sided research studies she blasts. <br />That brings me to one of my major criticisms of the book: most of the charges she levels against big-pharma could be made against any other industry. All industries report as little specific financial data as possible where she's asking for an exact accounting of R&D versus marketing expenses for every drug. All industries with the money to afford it spend ridiculous amounts lobbying politicians. Many industries have lavish trade shows that are perks for their members to attend, where they are wined and dined by someone who wants to sell them something or get their help selling something. Most competitive industries are guilty of \\"me-to\\" - when they see a competitor with something successful, they copy it within the extent of the law.  <br />While she makes some minor points that the pharma industry should be different, she spends so much time blasting R&D versus marketing that she fails to make a clear ethical, moral, or economic case of how the pharma industry is different and should be treated differently than say competition in the auto or beer industry. <br />The case would have been easy to make: pharma pricing should be regulated because it already benefits from govt subsidies in the form of research (a point she makes but doesn't tie specifically to price controls), because economically there are significant barriers to entry in the industry meaning that from a free market standpoint, the govt role should be to foster competition rather than protect monopolies, and that from a moral standpoint, the human benefit from affordable drug pricing is too great to ignore and hope the free-market invisible hand will outmaneuver patents and exclusive marketing rights. <br />I thought she failed to place enough blame on doctors themselves and their professional societies for curbing their own greed and kicking the pharms reps and pharma subsidies out of their businesses. The lingering question of \\"are you prescribing x instead of y because the x rep was hot and sent you on a \\"educational\\" trip to Cancun all expenses paid\\" should never have to come between a patient and doctor.  <br />I thought she failed to place enough blame on our own insatiable appetite for quick easy fixes. Why eat right and exercise to lower your cholesterol when their are a dozen statins to choose from? <br />I think she mentioned in one sentence the role that managed care (HMO/PPO, etc) plays in this \\"take the pill\\" attitude. Again, that's far too little emphasis. Managed case is the source of the time squeeze that forces doctors to see more patients in less time because the HMO/PPO has cut their reimbursement for doctor visits so the doc instead of counseling you to make a lifestyle change, you leave the office with a script. <br />I thought she failed to see the connection between our hyperlitigious society that's driving docs out of business through malpractice suits and docs covering their bases and offering a patient every possible prescription to avoid a malpractice suit if they don't get better. <br />Finally, I thought she failed in not considering the economic impact of the changes she's suggesting. This is not a win-win. All of the changes she's suggesting will result in massive pharma layoffs. Living in central Indiana, a region where Eli Lilly is one of the largest employers, the affects here would be devastating. We're not just talking about potential layoffs for 1000's of workers (10,000s? 100,000 throughout the industry?) we're talking about thousands more who are contractors, loss of work for the industries that provide support services for pharma, loss of a huge source of philanthropy in the case of Lilly's charitable foundation in Indy, probably a huge destabilization in real estate prices in communities that are home to big pharma headquarters, and the trickle down effects of laying off people from good paying jobs are just too numerous to list.  <br />I'm not saying that these economic factors would outweigh the benefits of some drug price controls, I'm no where near qualified to know that. But I fault her for not acknowledging the potential downside of her proposals either through economic ignorance or again deliberately stacking the deck in her choice of facts to present. <br />	2005-01-18
US	52601178	R3M6E9EJI3CEDQ	0830832025	628381942	Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage	Books	3	48	51	N	N	Good observations but not what you'd expect from the title	With a confrontational title like \\"Why the Rest Hates the West\\" you might expect a scathing talk-radio-style diatribe about the evils of the uncivilized non-western world. Or you might have expected the author to blame Western imperialism, Judeo-Christian religious history, and ecological shortsightedness for terrorist attacks. <br /> <br />Refreshingly, the book offers fodder for neither set of extremist views. Instead it's a reserved and rather academic (although readable) study in the differences between the post-modern West and the rest of the current world and all previous world cultures. In taking the high road though, I get the sense that the author might have titled this book \\"A History of Post-Modern Western Civilization's Moral Failings and their Long Range Impact on Global Demographic Shifts\\" and the publisher's publicist probably played a role in the \\"Hate\\" title despite little content in the book supporting it. <br /> <br />The author makes several keen observations on differences between the current west and non-western worlds. He details that the post-modern world has rejected its own religious heritage (despite the cries of the American left in the days following the 2004 election, the U.S. is not in danger of becoming puritanical although the U.S. does have a larger percentage of practicing Christians than many European countries). He looks at the west's history from the Renaissance, Enlightenment, Reformation, through the Victorian, post-Victorian, and finally post-modern ages. He observes the effects of all of these upheavals on the institution of the family.  <br /> <br />His first main conclusion is these changes along with industrialism have combined to devalue social institutions like the family and local communities while elevating the importance of individualism, nationality, and human rights. It is however the institutions of family (including ancestors) and local communities that all previous world cultures and the current non-western civilization still hold dear and it is this distinction (not religion itself or militarism) that separates the west from non-west today. The pre-industrial non-west can't afford the luxury of \\"individualism\\" - families need to stick together for mere sustenance and survival. Nationality is expressly rejected by Islam. And abstractions such as \\"human rights\\" mean little to anyone struggling day to day for clean water and food. Pre-modern societies who don't know where tomorrow's meal might come from also favor stability over change, so even an \\"evil\\" dictator who is stable is preferable to a change that might endanger the family's day-to-day living. Divorced from the reality of day-to-day living by hyperprosperity, the west can afford temporary instability in the name of the long term march of freedom and can't understand how anyone could deny the value of freedom. <br /> <br />While he doesn't say so explicitly (unfortunately) the inevitable conclusion I drew from the book up to this point is that the west, in its all-knowing all-powerful elitist style fails to understand that today's west took some 500 years of history to evolve. But we then turn around and try to force 500 years of \\"progress\\" down the rest of the world's throat in the name of \\"freedom\\" or \\"human rights.\\" If the rest of the world is to find \\"freedom\\" or \\"human rights\\" they're going to have to find it on their own terms, in their own time. Neither the approach of democracy at the point of a gun nor the approach of peaceful mediation to convince the non-west of the intellectual superiority of \\"tolerance\\" and other western values will advance real freedom's march by a day. (These are both laughable approaches considering the arbitrary geographic boundaries imposed by the west \\"joining\\" vastly different religious sub-cultures into pseudo-countries.) <br /> <br />He concludes the book with an unexpected twist: he ties all of the post-modern west's rejection of religion and tradition to staggeringly low birthrates in Europe, birthrates so low that they point to a population implosion. Along with rising senior citizen populations thanks to longer life expectancy, economic struggles result from an imbalance in the ration of workers to retires. These trends open the door to a flood of immigration to fill the European void and the current trend is this immigration is decidedly non-Western. The new immigrants aren't westernizing, are holding dear their traditional values including family which means higher birthrates in their populations, leading to the conclusion that \\"western\\" culture as we know if today in Europe will cease to exist within 100 years and will be equally balanced by the influx and growth of non-Western traditions. He paints a slightly different picture for the U.S. where the birthrate is at least holding steady at the minimum population rates but points out that immigration will reshape the U.S. as well. The only alternative is for the west to re-adopt traditional values. <br /> <br />And with that, the book ends. Not with a conclusion that the \\"rest\\" hates the \\"west\\" but that the current west is not viable because the population is not self-sustaining and that the non-west will overtake the west via population growth. <br />While in general he makes many good points and I felt I learned from reading it, there were things I didn't like about this. <br />First: the disconnect between the title and the material. He made very little effort to link his lengthy discourse on the last 500 years of western history to \\"hate\\" for the west from the rest.  <br /> <br />Second, while the issues of family and local community are important to many people non-western world, I think he vastly understates the role of religious differences in creating and maintaining the current divide. Millennia of religious differences and western military domination the last several hundred years are hatred's foundation. The fear that the western non-traditional values will be part of thewest's cultural steamroller only adds heat to hate's fire. <br /> <br />Finally, on the population sustainability note, I thought he failed in not connecting that if the non-west sees the west's non-sustainable birthrates, the non-west may fear the west will take the only other route available to any demographic that can't sustain through procreation - converting others (the non-west) to western culture. <br />	2005-01-14

That and Gaiman co-wrote \\"Good Omens\\" (with Terry Pratchett) which I enjoyed a ton.<br /><br />But, the great premise of an American mythology personified and come to life is undermined by truly disturbing sexual and violent content (no spoilers here though). The sex and violence seemed to only be in here to shock, not to tell a story. I don't think I'm a prude but there are some things I just don't want to read about and unfortunately, this book contained them. Which probably explained by it achieved best-seller status. Sometimes, it's nice not to be in the norm.<br /><br />Why 2 stars then? The beginning of the book isn't awful, and there are a few points where the author's excellent style overcomes the pathetic attempt at a story.	2005-01-08

It's short, under 300 pages, and if you have some time to kill, it's light enough to whip through in a few hours. The story and main character (Marc) get off to a very funny start. However, about mid-way through the book, about the time the Marc gets his job as chief apologizer to the world, the humor is harder to find. On the whole, it's completely worth reading though. <br />A couple of other minor issues that might bug some readers: if you aren't a foodie, the pages long descriptions of individual meals and foods could put you off. They're easy enough to skim through after the first few and after all, the author is a professional food critic so he's writing what he knows. American readers beware, some of the British slang might throw you. And, if there's any serious flaw it's that I didn't find either of Marc's two female love interests to be very believable or complete characters. They seem to just exist in the story for Marc's benefit, and don't stand very well on their own. The author put more effort into describing some of the chocolates in the story than he did development of the girlfriends. <br />But it's definitely still a funny book and worth reading. I found it a very entertaining balance to some weightier non-fiction I'm struggling through.	2005-01-04

This is classic techno, futuristic sci-fi with space-faring, and a space war. The plot of the war is all too believable and the twist at the end will stop you in your tracks. The main characters are all children and Card does a great job writing their characters and showing you their growth as they age. <br />The only possible drawback anyone might find in this book is in the outcome of the war. Some readers could very easily find that outcome too morally and ethically disturbing and criticize the book on that basis.

Many new best-sellers and best-seller hopefuls have been rushed to market in an attempt to capitalize on the interest to prove or disprove the \\"facts\\" behind the fictional \\"Da Vinci Code.\\" Although I must be one of the last people not to read the Code (I read one of Brown's other books and it was so bad I didn't feel the need to torture myself with another) I wanted to start my own journey of understanding of Biblical origins. I turned to a couple of seminary students I know for book recommendations but unfortunately they had none so I struck out on my own. My main criteria was to read something that was written by a Christian Biblical expert or experts, that it was written prior to Brown's novel so it isn't a reactionary book, and that it cover a range of issues regarding Biblical origins and the authority or lack thereof of individual books that are or aren't included in the modern standard Bible. <br /> <br />This book fit all of these criteria. It is a collected work (some of the chapters appear to be articles from scholarly publications). The positives I gained from it are a good foundation to allow me to understand other books on the topic. I think having read this I can now arm myself with the questions to read and analyze books more specific to apocryphal works and the accuracy of our current translations relative to original writings. <br /> <br />The problems I faced in reading this are that parts of it were redundant from article to article and author to author. Parts of it were also well over my head as a lay person, introducing scholarly terms that were never explained or defined. In general, I was able to follow most of it by context. The writing is also extremely dry, and I believe it was never intended for a general audience. This paperback edition was probably released (following the original hardcover 10+ years ago) in reaction to seeing the new found interest for other books.<br /> <br />Fortunately, it's also easy to skip around in, and doesn't require a complete front-to-back read. I'd recommend it for you if you have a real interest in starting a solid understanding of Biblical origins and translations and you are looking to avoid the books being turned out by the current hype machine. But, it isn't an easy read, so prepare yourself for some work. <br />	2004-12-27

Although written 20 years ago, it still seems visionary today. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition won't be remembered as either a classic or visionary. 2 years old as I write this, it already shows signs of age. Gibson seems to be trying to be cutting edge current, with the main characters \\"googling\\" each other, a discussion of steganography (very 90s), and other current tech references. But what they show is that Gibson is out of his element in using real world current tech instead of envisioning the future. His reliance on media-propagated internet (and cultural) stereotypes begs the question of whether the future he foresaw in Neuromancer has already left him far behind in reality. <br />The female protagonist has a mental aversion to brands and can't safely go into department stores, wear clothes that are overbranded, etc, without risking physical manifestations of her malady. Yet while she suffers from even seeing the Michelin Man in print form, she is comfortable carry around an iBook, complete with its iBook and Apple logos one supposes, with no problems. Is Gibson trying to impress his literary and artistic circle of pals who \\"know\\" that Macs and iAnything are the only cool tech products the in circle can own? Or, judging by the insane number of times her laptop is referred to by its brand name as \\"iBook\\" maybe this is the first occurrence of movie-style corporate brand placement in a book? Or maybe that's Gibson's little ironic joke on all of us: that his brand-averse heroine is helping him promote iBooks. <br />Beyond that annoying fact, I was deeply disturbed by the secondary plot line involving the female lead's deceased father and 9/11. There may come a day when passing references to 9/11 are appropriate in literature and film. But here, it's too recent and fresh. It's inappropriate and comes off as a cheap plot device. <br />I'm sure this book has some redeeming literary value that I missed, that Gibson has some artistrywith his voice that rises above a weak plot that won't stand the test of time. But that wasn't what I was reading it for.	2004-12-27

Terrific plot, unique premise, and good characters. Even though it is a \\"message\\" book, the message is well delivered and doesn't get in the way of a fun read. You don't have to believe the author's eco-message to enjoy reading this. My only complaint: I've thought for years that the author left the ending open enough for a sequel which has never come unfortunately. And I've tried reading some of his other series oriented books and found them to be pale and shallow in comparison, obviously produced to meet an unending string of deadlines.	2004-12-19

As other reviewers have noted, it bogs down in sex (and sexuality, and gender roles), and is hopelessly complex. It's trying to deliver at least a half dozen political messages at once, and is so laden with them that it fails on all of them.	2004-12-19
US	52601178	R359IR5VPXBRZ0	0380978938	591476242	Ilium	Books	4	2	2	N	N	As good as Hyperion	I wouldn't have picked this book up except for an article Dan contributed to a recent issue of the Wabash College alumni magazine. Until then, I didn't know he and I went to the same school, and I hadn't cared for the last several books in the Hyperion series. But, given that parts of the Illiad and Odyssey are required reading at Wabash, I decided to support a fellow alumn. <br />And in general, I'm glad I did. This is a fun book to read, with mostly fun characters and a fairly unique combination of plot devices. I liked Hyperion, although not the remainder of the books in that series (which I plowed through just to get the satisfaction of getting to the end). So, I'm hoping Olympos is a better follow-up than the later Hyperion books. <br />I thought the Eloi and \\"Time Machine\\" allusions (and outright references) were overdone. But I've never been a big Time Machine fan so that probably influences my opinion.  <br />I enjoyed the Illiad and Trojan War references. However, they did lend more length to an already longwinded style. But, if you are going to dive into the Illiad, there's no decent way to do it briefly. You can read this book without being an Illiad or Trojan War expert by the way. My memories of what I read of this in the mid-80s are fuzzy at best. His reference guide to the Greek gods, trojans, etc at the back of the book is very helpful in this regard.  <br />I don't care much for the regular pattern of 3 plots, with chapters rotating through each plot 1 by 1.	2004-12-13

Any of those three are so much better than this. But, Bellwether is fun, sometimes funny, and a lightweight read. It's short enough to blow through, uncomplicated enough not to require flipping back to be sure you didn't miss anything. Anyone who works in an office will recognize all of the office characters and politics -  they're universal sure gags we all love to identify with.	2004-12-11

The 4th edition adds a new chapter on Ajax, simplifies some of the examples to focus the learning more on the concept and less on the example data itself, and is rearranged for some better flow. There were also fewer working authors on this edition for better cohesion from chapter to chapter.	2004-09-20

The second edition adds some new great coverage of dynamic HTML in more recent browser versions and a new chapter on JavaScript and XML.

Very slow pacing and a setting that is hard to relate to today. The characters themselves lend some interest and I can see how the characters and their situations would lead a major celebrity to endorse this for a reading club, but unless you genuinely enjoyed War and Peace or other classic tomes, be realistic with yourself and recognize the odds are slim that you'll finish this.	2004-06-01

I didn't actually spend a whole weekend with the book as the title suggests, but each lesson takes about the amount of time prescribed and getting through the book in several evenings over the course of a week or two is pretty easy. be sure of course to get the right versions of MySQL, Apache, and PHP. The combination of the 3 can lead to problems if you don't use the exact versions with all the right patches applied as the author suggests. I had tinkered with IIS some in the past but never before had I done anything more complicated than HTML web pages. From the examples in this book, I was able to set up my own web site with a database.	2004-05-01

The other reviewers stating there are many errors in this book are exaggerating the case. I found a few errors as is to be expected from any technical book but I also found a lively discussion at the Wrox web site forums where many other readers and the authors gladly helped each other answer questions about the book and even general ASP.NET questions that we not specific to the book. All in all, I learned a lot from these authors.	2004-04-23
US	52601178	R2A7HQ4I451J0N	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	2	7	7	N	N	Rabbit Roadkill	This is the worst Clancy book I've read to date and I think I've read every piece of his fiction. (That doesn't include the books that have his name on the along with a co-author which are clearly written by the co-author and his name is just window dressing.) Clancy's strengths are in the military strategy, the combat techniques, and action elements of his other books. I'm 1/2 way through the hardcover version (bought on discount from a discount table) and so far the entire book has consisted of people sitting in their office cubicles and homes. If I thought that was action, I'd peer outside my door at our office cubicle farm instead of reading. His attempt to make Jack into a stock market genius by &quot;predicting&quot; in the early 80s that a small Seattle coffee start-up would be a good investment or the constant creation of back stories to match the minor characters' histories from other books just comes off as clumsy and silly. I hope he sticks to what he does well in the future. I do applaud him for the courage to try something different but I hope he can see this was a weak effort.	2004-04-09

I knew I wouldn't enjoy this book when 21 pages in the author completely botched the explanation of public key encryption. I'm not a cryptographer, computer scientist, or national security expert, just an average guy who uses a PC. Anyone who's ever read a single newspaper or internet article about encryption probably has the facts more correct than this author did.<BR>Reading techno-thrillers, like sci-fi or big-budget action flicks requires a \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" But if the author is going to try to pass himself off as an expert in something he clearly isn't, and make a huge mistake, it's hard to take anything after that seriously.<BR>The rest of the cryptography discussion is over my limited knowledge, or completely made up, doesn't matter. The computing terms thrown in read like the author made a laundry list of every acronym, protocol, and technology he'd ever read about and just dumped them in every-other sentence to impress readers.<BR>If you can use your computer for more than email and web browsing, you'll be thoroughly insulted by this.<BR>And, yes, the plot is weaker than the single digit \\"kill code,\\" as are the paper thin characters.	2004-02-17

Mr. Goldberg's newspaper editorial piece that ignited his fame was the right vehicle for his opinions. A few hundred words, a few examples culled from his years of experience at CBS made his opinions interesting and insightful, whether or not you agree with his analysis.<BR>However, even as one who generally agrees with what he's saying, the book was painful to read after the first few chapters. I found it repetitious and shallow. After the first 50 pages or so, you've read everything unique he has to say. This book proves why Mr. Goldberg was a producer at CBS and not on-air-talent. He's not Andy Rooney, more like a not-funny bitter shadow of Andy Rooney.	2002-04-08

In it he delivers opinions and insights regarding the players and teams he coached at Indiana (and West Point) over the years. Ninety percent of the book is a pleasant trip down memory lane with personal stories about the likes of Uwe Blab, Brian Sloan, Matt Nover, and of course, the \\"superstars\\" Isiah, Damon, Alford, Calbert, and too many more to list. And there are little tidbits that all but the most dedicated die-hard IU trivia fans would have never known, such as Jon Gruden (the NFL coach) having been an IU basketball ball boy.<BR>The book is seriously flawed in two ways though. While some of the stories about his great celebrity friends are a fun read (the Ted Williams stories stand out) others come across as constant name dropping. Second, near the end there are about 40 pages detailing Coach Knight's view of why he was fired. (In fact, contrary to what some other reviewers have written, most of the book is not vindictive outside of this section other than an occasional barb elsewhere.) If you follow IU basketball, you certainly know all this and it's a fresh wound. His retelling here won't convince anyone on either side of the debate to switch sides. The book would have been better had he condensed that part of the story to a few pages.	2002-04-08
