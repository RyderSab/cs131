After the GREAT &quot;About Face&quot; Hackworth hasn't quite recaptured his ability to tell an intelligent story nor teach a lesson intelligibly.  I was really disappointed in this book...it is written for teenagers and war groupies, rather than soldiers and/or historians hoping to learn something (other than catchy cliches and snappy comebacks...and a few new ways to swear) from this soldier's vast experience.	2002-05-07

Without this background, Farwell's fine book will be nothing more than anecdotal and amusing.  This books is a valuable addition to the literary collections of military historians and modern military officers.	2001-10-05

This truly exhaustively researched book of one of the greatest infantry warriors of the 20th century is seriously flawed by the author's inappropriate use of jargon and cliche's.  LtCol Hoffman, a well educated man, unfortunately has only reinforced the sea-story legend personna of Puller (just like Burke Davis) in his attempt to establish Puller as something more.  This book is more for Marine groupies than serious Marine students of warfare.	2001-08-23

Unrepentant and loudmouthed is the way Skorzeny lead his life and the men of his SS special forces.  If you want to read a revisionist, mealy-mouthed apology by a man who lived his life on the edge, this is NOT the book.  On the other hand, if you want to gain perspective into the man and his times AS THEY REALLY WERE, this is the book for you.  A great read, but for the full story, read &quot;My Commando Operations.&quot;  No professional military officer should be without this book.	2001-05-16

Buy a used copy of Bear's Guide, as this edition is really justa re-hashing of earlier versions.  Nevertheless, Bear's Guide isprobably the only comprehensive source of distance education info onthe market.  It is a great starting point for anyone really interested in pursuing distance education.  I would point to three areas of concern, however.  First, distance education is much cheaper than the traditional format: You get what you pay for...no matter the medium.  Bear's Guide touches on this only slightly.  Second, Mr. Bear(a pseudonym), has quite a large following of rabid, unquestioning groupies who tend to \\"circle the wagons\\" any time Mr. Bear is publically challenged.  Most reviews of this book, at this site, are written by these groupies...Finally, with Mr. Bear's growing popularity and entourage, I would say the quality of Bear's Guide has been slipping.  This current edition is merely a re-hashing of his last.	2001-01-09
