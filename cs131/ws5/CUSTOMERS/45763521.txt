Kureishi's \\"Buddha of Suburbia\\" is a look at race relations in England, the aspirations of youth and the problems of family.  All of this is put right under the surface of a story narrated by the English born adolescent, half Pakistani, half British young man called Karim.  <br />Karim is so self involved that he has little idea of what is going on around him, and it is through his heavily biased eyes that events show themselves to us.<br />Everything that is revealed to us, from his family's turmoil, Karim's own greed, his neglect of his family during this difficult time, his aspirations to become famous, and above all else: to get laid, all of this comes sneaking past the bewildered young protagonist.<br />His friends, family and co-workers are all wonderfully colorful characters that represent the full spectrum of clich√©s and stereotypes in the London suburbs of the 1970's.  <br />These people are all trying to live and to get by in their own ways, and Karim in anticipation of the American &quot;Reagen 1980's&quot; is trying to make sure that the world will give him everything that he desires.<br />Kureishi is such a brilliant stylist that we forget that he has created these characters and that Karim is not in fact telling us this story.  His prose style is superb and flowing.  The plot flows and entertains us while many complex and human themes are revealed in a bare nakedness that amazes the reader, without becoming &quot;preachy&quot; or overly pastoral.<br />This is not just an amazing social commentary, though it is that, but rather in fact, a wonderful and fully entertaining romp through the Suburbs of London, the city itself and even the U.S.'s East coast during the 1970's.	2002-01-12

Yoshimoto's writing is to Japanese literature as Feng-Shui is to Chinese decorating: simple, spiritual, deep and insightful.<br />Six separate stories (including \\"Lizard\\") all speak about passion, intensity, confusion and desperation.  Yoshimoto's characters embody the lost Generation X philosophy.  Deep thinkers unable to figure out the world around them: this common thread runs throughout each of these tales that somehow uplift and manage to celebrate life.<br />Short stories in a small book that doesn't even reach 200 pages, yet with a Hemingway like brilliance, Yoshimoto forced 800 pages worth of depth into these stories.  We begin with an apparently simple read that becomes a stark yet hopeful look into the human condition and the lives of people in their twenties, living in this mind blowing world.	2002-01-12

Following an antiques dealer and his wife as the two attempt to sell cheep dresses on the black market as a favor to a friend.<br />Sexual morays and British stereo type stuffiness are thrown out the window as the two find themselves trapped in the Soviet Union with the police on Paul Hussey's trail.  On the boat ride over his American wife, Belinda, becomes sick and finds herself hospitalized for a terrible rash.<br />\\"Honey for the Bears\\" satirizes the secret capitalist desires of the Soviet people with a schizophrenic jump between their urges for Western pleasures and at the same time a contempt for the capitalist pigs that cannot even take care of their own people.<br />Sharp, witty and insightful, Burgess again succeeds in bringing together a dark twisted world that strongly resembles our own.  As always, Burgess' mastery of linguistics shines through as he plays games with language and dialects: thus giving his characters a sense of reality.	2002-01-12

These stories talk about a civil servent working as a teacher and trying to make a change in the lives of people who are already changing their own world as they give the boot the their one time British task masters.  <br />The teacher turned administrator, Victor Crabbe, tries desperately to keep control of his own eroding life as he sees the rotting of the systems created by the British many years before.  His own fall is much like the one that the British empire took, and like the workers in the empire: he tries to help and reform things after it is too late for him to cause any positive effect.<br />Crabbe wants to unite the different Asian ethnic groups that are taking control of Malaya (Malaysia now), but the only thing that they can agree upon is their hatred for the white man and also their hatred of each other.<br />This tale is edgy and gritty but at the same time, Burgess' wonderful wit and humor come shining through.  Tragic and sad one minute, and absurdly funny the next, the one thing that &quot;The Long Day Wanes&quot; always has is brilliance and insight into the human condition.<br />A delightful and moving trilogy, &quot;The Long Day Wanes&quot; runs with Burgess' style in that he constantly plays with dialect and word games.  The comedy of language and the way that people communicate (or fail to do so) is a constant theme in Anthony Burgess' work, andthis trilogy makes sure to keep that alive and well; even if it is only a small facet of this masterpiece.	2002-01-10

The duel tables of context, one in chronological order and the other seperating the writers topically was a useful tool.<br />This book only skims the surface of ethics and is limited in its scope; making it useful only for an introduction course.  The problem this leaves is that the reading sections tend to be thick and will not capture the attention of a reader unless they must read in order to pass a class.<br />The study questions at the end of each section are very basic, some times simple enough to be answered by high school students, but open enough that they work within the context of a college class room.<br />A slow read.  This book should only be purchased by college students that are taking a course that requires them to buy it.  Otherwise, the level of interest that this book has to offer is rather limited.	2001-12-20

A masterpiece of psychological evaluation, linguistics and satire.<br />The work chronicles the &quot;near future&quot; as seen by Burgess, where he creates a new form of slang and language for his characters and masterminds a dark reality in the vain of &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot; and similar stories.  Yet there is not just the forewarnings of doom seen in the writings of other dark future writers, but also a slightly hidden but wonderful sense of wit and humor.<br />In the American re-edition called the intro &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked&quot; and complained bitterly about what Kubrick did with the movie.  More likely than not he was proud but just angry with Kubrick's leaving out the final chapter of the book, as he mentions.<br />Burgess looks at the darkest impulses of humanity, and the out of control attempts that society goes to in order to rectify and &quot;cure&quot; the social deviants.  This is not just a dark future, but also a warning to us about the course that our reform programs seem to be heading towards.<br />Gritty, dark, somber and somehow always cleaver, this mini novel is a must read for everyone.  Burgess flourishes with his mastery of how language works and employs his gifts as a linguist to bring out a colorful sub-culture lingo that has evolved (within the context of the book) from the reasonable and normal perversions of every day speech to the language.<br />Burgess said that there were other books that he would rather have been remembered for.  &quot;A CLockwork Orange&quot; brings modern readers to the late Burgess' prose and leaves us interested to go on and see some of the wealth that inhabits the rest of his writing.	2001-12-18

He critically analyzed all the information and conflicting sources that he had before making a decision. Although some of the theories that he put forth may not be seen as wrong; this critical thought was an impresive leap in the writing of history.<br />The creater of the battle narative he wrote from a perspective other than the Homeric poetic tradition.  Looking at battles as more than the hubris of a few men.<br />Wonderful and informative.  Although there are many parts of Herodotus that must be questioned, he is an invaluable resource to anyone interested in Greek history or the early classical historians.  He was the first.<br />Some sections of the writing become heavy handed because of his moralizations and theories that revolve around the gods, but this just adds flavor to this interesting historian.  Herodotus began a new genre of writing and did it with style.<br />Because of his tendancy to run off in many different directions, it is helpful to only read him in sections or with a sylabis put together by a Greek historian.  Otherwise one can drown in this massive, but wonderful work.	2001-12-16

A thoughtful and deep look into the war that tore apart the ancient Greek world, this is the original &quot;Clash of the Titans.&quot;<br />Thucydides employs the use of rhetorical and artistic forms to put forth major speeches and to give us a glimps into selected sections and minor scirmishes that led to the war between Athens and Sparta.<br />Rather than the traditional Homeric theory that Wars happened because of the actions of a few people in high places, Thucy. looks to larger social and international reasoning.  There is no &quot;it's because of the gods,&quot; but instead a deep look at human nature and the way that we behave.<br />A general in the war, and later this historian and writer, Thucy. looks at the human condition logically and uses a medical perspective to break things down as if war, and even human nature were a disease that we have yet to cure.  This is genius.<br />He begins with the theory that the only important things are: men, money and ships.  This returns again and again throughout the entire work until we see how ironical this statement was, and that he has been slowly dragging us along to follow his theories.<br />Wonderfully writen and amazingly ahead of its time, this history should be on everyone's shelf; after they have read it at least once.	2001-12-16

The need for the over-throw of the royal family and the current (at the time) political system of Russia.  Also the theories of the revolutionary newspaper, information, and what revolutionaries should do for the movement.<br />A very thick little book.  The concepts of who may become a revolutionary and what parts of the populace should be tapped are all included in this piece.<br />The major flaw is the fact that one must work very hard to figure out what Lenin is trying to say.  There is so much diversion and unclear thinking that one is not surprised to find out that Lenin never dearmed of seeing the revolution within his own life time.  He must have thought that nobody would be able to get through his book before he would die of very old age.<br />Interesting for the sake of political history and revolutionary theory alone.  Nobody in their right mind would read this book unless they were being required to do so.  On the other hand, they might just be happy that they had been forced to read this book, because there really is a lot there (if you are willing to dig far enough).	2001-12-16

Looking at life, loss and relationships, the two long stories in &quot;Kitchen,&quot; are placed in the lives of young women trying to get on in a difficult world, and how their kitchens reflect their lives.<br />Yoshimoto's writing is the literary equivalent of the Chinese decorating style, &quot;feng-shui.&quot;  Yoshimoto's prose is straght forward and at first look, simple.  The mastery of her style is that it sits at the edge, and is almost invisable to the reader.<br />The prose flows and does not manhandle the reader; instead it gently takes the reader on a ride through amazing stories.  The &quot;Kitchens&quot; are a theme that unites the two stories but there is a deeper connection as Yoshimoto speaks of the confussion and loss that many generation X'ers feel.<br />Beautiful, seemingly simple but deeply profound.	2001-09-13

Confussed?  That tends to happen a little with this book.<br />Well written in Yoshimoto's wonderful and flowing style, this is a story of sucide, love, sex, death and depression.  Dark, oft times funny and always powerful, Yoshimoto has come up with another hit.<br />This is a wonderful story that takes Yoshimoto's wonderful prose to places that it has never traveled to before.  The most impressive things about Yoshimoto are her style with its unimpossing voice and her way to get inside her characters and to bring such devistated and yet hopeful people to life in so few pages.<br />Yoshimoto should be on the reading list for all young Americans.

This is the ringing endorcement, that sits on posters and adds, in Burgess' future world in the novel, &quot;The Wanting Seed.&quot;<br />In this book, Burgess, takes some tried and true formula from some of his other novels: a drastically different future that could happen (&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;), a main character that is an instructor (&quot;The Doctor is Sick&quot;), and a satire on the absurd nature of large industries (&quot;The Complete Enderby&quot;).<br />This time around, Burgess is writing about a future that has become a bleak place (Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;), but taken his on take on a future gone slightly off.  An ultra liberal future (not a bad thing), faces a gross over population (not that far off).<br />This novel revolves around the lives of a history teacher and his family and how they fit into and adapt to a world different from our own, that is going through many drastic changes.<br />As a common theme to Burgess' books, this story is looking at the indaviduals that somehow get lost in a place that is drying out their humanity.  The author praises them as they try to find and hold onto their humanity, at the same time he attacks major functions of society: the army and government, witha priceless satirical wit.<br />Again, as with other novels, Burgess uses his background as a linguisist, to toy with the odd variety of speech, and the many forms that it takes.  The prose style is very vivid.  Burgess paints stiring, oft times disturbing pictures for the reader.	2001-09-08

Unlike other stories on this subject; this tale is drawn from the personal experience of the author and gives an interesting perspective.<br />This book is not a glorification of herion use, or much of a condemnation of it either.  &quot;Junk is a way of life,&quot; says the author, and the narrative seems to prove this rather well.<br />A small book, the one major failing, that it seems to be much longer than it is.  With no definite chapters or sections, the book drawls on at some points, only broken up with little markers that appear to be like scene changes in a film script.  This marker tell the reader that time has passed, or that the landscape is going to change.<br />This book is fascinating, and does tell an interesting tale, but because it was written a couple of generations ago, it moves a bit too slowly at times and holds very little of the meaning that it would have for the Beat, or even the Hyppie generations.<br />Burroughs' theme and characters are both very interesting, but the prose style drags on.  This book should not be read on a rainy day: it may take a bit of time to get through it, but it will bring the reader down.	2001-09-08

One of the most striking plays written in the 20th century, Samuel Beckett's, &quot;Waiting for Godot,&quot; is a must read for any serious student of theater, lover of the theater of the absurd, or those interested in high thought as seen through the eyes of a couple of nobodys.<br />An absurd play, it is stirring, chilling and unreprentively satirical.  The characters even poke fun at the play that they are in as one of the states that, &quot;nothing ever happens,&quot; and he is right.  Stark and empty, the play has an air of waiting for something to happen.  Not only are the main characters, Didi and Gogo (Vladimir and Estragon), waiting for something monumental, but so are the readers.<br />The potential bleakness of the world that we live in comes to a head in this play where every action hinges on the appearance of Godot, who strikes a resemblence (acording to the players) to God himself.<br />Beckett was quoted as saying that if he had meant, &quot;God,&quot; he would have said &quot;God.&quot;  Godot, is ambiguous and powerful; as is the play that carries his name.<br />An excellent, though thick read.  The play is dark, and by no means uplifting.  By this point in time, &quot;Waiting for Godot,&quot; should have been read by everyone.  This piece is the center of the theater of the absurd movement, and has been quoted, and been alluted to more often then any play since its writing.  It is perhaps only less well read than, &quot;Hamlet,&quot; and &quot;Private Lives,&quot; by Shakespeare and Coward, respectively.	2001-09-07

The selesctions that were chosen from some of the greatest philosophers: Plato, Kant, Buddha, Descartes, Locke, Hume and Nietzsche, were well thought out before being put in.<br />This text is seperated into sections, God, death, ethics etc. to put Western (and some Eatern) thought into bite size pieces.  Having the works of the philosophers in their own words and not interpreted for you is one of the strenghts of this text.<br />There are questions and exercises at the end of each section, placed there by the editors to be helpful; these are the major failing of the book.  The beliefs of the editor (who includes some of his own work in the text book) come through in the questions and are quite biased (though not invalid).<br />For an intro course this is a wonderful text.  Also, it may give a person that is new to philosophy, some ideas and thoughts as to whom they may wish to read in the future.<br />All in all, not a bad book.  It serves its purpose as a text for 101 level classes at the college level, but does not do much beyond that.	2001-08-23

This translation of his works, by Walter Kaufmann, is the definitive version and the best translation from Deutsch to English available. Kaufmann was celebrated for his writings and work on Nietzsche.<br />This edition takes one of the most prolific and intelligent people from the 19th-20th centuries and brings him to us in all of his glory.<br />A small book (700 pages), and yet there is both a good sampling of Nietzsche's early works, and the complete transcripts of his four most important books. This single edition allows for someone to follow the evolution of Nietzsche's writing and his very thought process over the course of his life.<br />The works of Friedrich Nietzsche should be read by anyone and everyone, not just those who are in an enviornment of higher education. If you agree with him, or even hate him and everything that he stands for, it is worth it to read this amazing man's work. If nothing else, it will cause you to stop and reevaluate everything that you hold dear. Reading Nietzsche, and understanding him are to very different things: and understanding him does not mean that one will agree with him; just that one will learn to stop and think about the world around them rather than to just tkae things for granted.	2001-08-07

Burgess' use of the English language as a plot moving device is at the same level of pure genius that it reached in his most famous novel, &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;<br />At the same time, this is a sentimental tale that looks at the modern world and its tendancy to dehumanize and objectify people.  Funny, and comedic in an off kilter satirical way, this novel tries to bring the humanity back to the protagonist, the sick professor, Edwin Spindrift.<br />The story shows the same cyincal look towards the hospital, and specifically mental health issues, that were later seen in the second of Burgess' &quot;Enderby&quot; tales.<br />This is truely the story of the humanization of Dr. Spindrift and his joining the &quot;real&quot; world for the first time in his life.  A wonderfuly written, bittingly satrical and greatly humorous book, this is a must read for anyone who enjoyed &quot;Clockwork,&quot; the widely read &quot;Complete Enderby,&quot; or any of Burgess' other works of fiction.<br />There is an insider look at the medical world, Burgess, who himself was diagnossed with a brain tumor, brings his own knowledge of the condition and adds to it the satire on British institutions that was a common theme in his fiction.<br />Anthony Burgess shows us that humanity is sick as much as the good doctor, and that it might be out tendancy to lose the human in the machines of every day life, that is the real problem.	2001-08-06

Synge was a very important Irish playwright of the early 20th century.  These plays, especially, &quot;Playboy of the Western World,&quot; are pivotal to Irish literature, and now, Irish culture.  Any serious student of British drama, or actor should read both of these plays.<br />On the other hand, it may not be an ideal idea for someone that does not fall into one of those two catagories.  The dialectic style is very thick, and at times difficult to understand.  &quot;Playboy,&quot; an important (and early) Irish peasant drama is beautifully writen, but for a casual reader it would probably come off as a slow read that is not all that entertaining.<br />Important work from cultural and recent historical perspectives, but these plays are very dated and, as I mentioned, not the most entertaining read.	2001-08-02

This book covers the entire spectrum of one of Ireland's greatest writers.<br />Creater of the theater of the absurd, world renouned playwright, and man who single handedly made a place for the &quot;shorter play,&quot; in a world that had come to expect a minimum of two acts, for a peice of drama to be considered serious.<br />This book contains novels, novel excerpts and short stories, all of which, redefined the genres that they belonged to.  Prolific, constantly changing, and reaching new hights, Beckett redefined every genre that he wrote in, and set new levels of perfection for the rest of us to reach for.<br />One can not say enough things about this true literary genius.  The best advice that I can give you is, buy this book, read it, and give yourself the perfect oppertunity to become aquainted with Beckett.  This book gives a wondeful over view of each of Beckett's writing stages and the evolution of his work.	2001-08-02

The jokes are piled so thickly on top of each other, that in real time, it is imposible to catch everything, or to digest all of the deeper meanings that this play attempts to expose.	2001-07-31

For anyone that has read or seen Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet,&quot; reading, &quot;R&amp;G Are Dead,&quot; is a must.<br />Reversing the story of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; so that the minor characters take the lead, and Hamlet himself becomes only background noise, Stoppard, brings new life to one of the most important plays in English language.<br />Funny and off kilter, this play takes two of Shakespeare's minor players and makes them &quot;deep&quot; philosophical thinkers who are just trying to naviagte their way through the backstabbing Royal Court of Denmark, and to get a free meal or two.<br />For anyone who has seen the great film version starring Gary Oldman, the play is even better, and well worth the read.	2001-07-31

The final story, &quot;Enderby's Dark Lady,&quot; is wonderful and surprising to the reader with value not only for fans of the dyspeptic poet but lovers of Shakespeare as well.  <br />While slightly dated, these stories have a bite to them that speaks volumes of truth for anyone who has been an academic, a professional writer or just a little bit out of touch with the world around them.  Enderby is often misunderstood and though he makes his living in a &quot;communication&quot; field, he has a lot of trouble getting his point across to others.<br />Not only are these books funny, but as is often the case with Burgess, the satire is thinly veiled and pointing at both society and himself.	2001-07-30

These people make the rest of our families seem pretty good.  The play is twisted and as much a psychological journey as anything else.<br />Pinter lives up the claim that his plays were like, &quot;Beckett in doors,&quot; with this one. Though most of Pinter's plays have a dark edge to them, this one may even cross over the line, if you are paying close attention to what is really going on.<br />Worth reading at least twice, after the shock from the first time through, the second read (if read closely), becomes even darker and more forbidding.<br />Wonderfully written, and further proof that Pinter is one of the masters of modern British drama.	2001-07-30

Not for those who are easily offended or whose feelings are hurt.  Orton, who was described as a &quot;poor Oscar Wilde,&quot; lived up to the name.  His plays are fast paced assults on everything that the British hold dear.  There is no respect for religion, custom, death or social norms.<br />Satirical and full of quick wit, Orton's plays attack British culture and spit on everything that the &quot;respectable person,&quot; would hold dear.<br />Orton does not hold back anything and could come on a bit strong for a conservative reader, but my suggestion is that any lover of drama and theater should own and read these plays.	2001-07-30
