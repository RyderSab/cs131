That being a very subjective statement that helps you know nothing about the book, other than that the stories are good, let me quote from the jacket cover what I found to be very true in reading this book.      \\"THE SAINT BOOK, written by a noted religious educator and \\"story lady\\", is a lives of the saints that is factual and dependable enough to be trusted yet engaging enough to be useful to families, teachers, and homilists. In brief, lively sketches Mary Reed Newland sets the saint in his or her time and place, focusing on those details of character and biography that are most appealing to children but also to adults. While never missing a good yarn or two or minimizing the fact that the saints were as human as the rest of us, Mrs. Newland shows how the saints' lives can still offer examples of incomparable human experiences and models of extraordinary spiritual progress.\\"     Unfortunately, you can't buy this book from Amazon.

I would agree with most of what they have said. I do want to say that I believe that this book is one which will be appreciated by both children and adults given the reasons stated elsewhere on this book's page. I also want to point out that while there are few words about Scholastica, the pictures in the book show her as a novice, being accepted into the community and being sent out with other nuns from one foundation to begin another monastery, being chosen of the abbess for it. These pictures are included on the same pages that are portraying Benedict's life and relate to what is happening in Scholastica's life at the same time period as what is being written about which is happening in Benedict's life.	2005-10-08

While there is one 9 page chapter on St. Brigid out of this 20 chapter 178 page book, most are of Irish priests who went sailing elsewhere as missionaries or who dealt with scary situations. The writing is not particularly good, though it is not bad writing. The version I read was published in 1955. I have found that a number of books on saints written before Vatican II were not written as well as those written after Vatican II, though I do not know the reason for that. Maybe before Vatican II reading books on saints was more popular, so the writing did not have to have the same quality for selling as those written after that time. There are very few pictures in this book and the ones which are there are black and white, so the child would need to be of an age where pictures are not important.  This book includes stories on the following saints:  Adamnan.......Benignus.......Brendan.......Brigid.......Canice.......Ciaran.......Colman of Kilmacduagh.......Colman-Elo.......Columbanus.......Columcille.......Cormac.......Finbarr.......Finnian.......Flannan.......Gall.......Laurence O'Toole.......Modomnoc.......Patrick.......Thaddeus MacCarthy.......The monk who heard the bird sing for 150 years.	2005-10-08

To give you an example of what I mean, let me quote the following from this book on page 121 about St. Francis of Assisi:<br />  \\"Francis had pets, a lamb, a pheasant, a rabbit, a cicada, a dog, a wolf, but upon honest and unsentimental terms. For he was as polite and considerate to an earthworm, a slug, a bird, a beetle or a mole, as amusedly tolerant and withal, understanding and warmly loving as one would be to one's brothers and sisters. He called them so, not with the pious emptiness the words have come to connote in modern times, but with the deep conviction of the kinship.<br />  It is told of him that he would stoop to remove an earthworm from his path so as not to crush it. One feels that with Francis it was a personal as well as symbolic courtesy to something living he happened to encounter.<br />  There appears to be a touch of the child's world of fancy in this but it is really an intensely practical way of life aboard an overpopulated planet, and what is more, it has the great advantage of beauty over ugliness. Looking back to the daily joy and happiness that Francis managed to crowd into the forty-four years of his life it is not at all difficult to understand that it is better to be kind than unkind and to be generous and accommodating instead of rude and possessive. This is not childish. It is one of the most adult discoveries ever made.\\"<br />  If this is the kind of retelling of the saints lives that you want, then this is a good book for you.

In the opening paragraph it explains that a \\"Golden Legend\\" was \\"an enormous book which a learned priest had set down everything he could find about the saints and martyrs of the Church, everything he thought interesting, amusing sometimes, and of course instructive.\\" This is such a book. While I wouldn't say that by \\"instructive\\" that there was any preaching that really went on here. The one historical inaccuracy that I found in this Golden Legend was where it talks about Saul going to Damascus by foot and alone, rather than by horse and with others, as is depicted in the book of Acts. However the rest of the story gave you greater insight as to what that must have been like for him.<br /><br />It is one of those books you hate to see come to an end. And I am sad that it is out of print. I got mine from my library, though I wish that I could have a copy to give to my nephew. If you want to find other excellent books please feel free to check out the over 20 other books on saints that I have reviewed.<br /><br />  It covers the following saints when they were children:<br /><br />Marcellus, the boy who gave his lunch to Jesus;<br /><br />Mark, the boy who fled the soldiers in the Garden of Gethsemane and who later wrote the Gospel by his name;<br /><br />Saul, who became Paul;<br /><br />Beautiful Agnes, a martyr;<br /><br />Blandina, a slave girl;<br /><br />Frumentius and Aedesius, two captives in Ethiopia who were also missionaries to the people there;<br /><br />Genevieve the Shepherdess;<br /><br />St. Brendan and the boy from the North;<br /><br />Odilia, the blind princess;<br /><br />Louis IX, King of France, as a boy;<br /><br />Joan of Arc, soldier for France;<br /><br />Aloysius Gonzaga, a boy saint;<br /><br />Bernadette Soubirous and our Lady of Lourdes;<br /><br />Charles Lwanga, Joseph Mkasa, and other young martyrs of Uganda;<br /><br />and Dominic Savio, a member of Don Bosco's Oratory.	2005-10-05

But there needs to be an awareness that these are legends, or as Funk and Wagnalls defines that word, \\"An unauthenticated story from earlier times, preserved by tradition and popularly thought to be historical\\". The first story is about St. Christopher, which the Catholic church has  indicated they are not sure really lived. Some stories seem well within the possibility of reality others don't. But, as the author says on the back cover, \\"If you were to ask me if these stories are true, I could only reply that if they are not, then they should be, for goodness, is true and so is humility and so is love, and if goodness and truth and humility and love cannot work wonders, then there may be no wonder in the world at all, but only cold facts and concrete.\\"      There is one picture for each of the 15 stories which vary from 7 to 16 pages in length.

Other miracles accompany these visitations, the end result of which is that millions of people who were unable to accept the religion of their ruthless Spanish conquerors were able to embrace the religion of this maiden and became Christians. Tomie De Paola is well known among elementary school and children's librarians as a great author and illustrator and this book is just another reason that she has this reputation. Of course, the events involved in how the Mexicans were able to accept the religion of their conquerors were great!

This book was originally written in Germany, but I can only imagine that the reason that it was interpreted into English is because it was so popular in Germany!  There are 2 pages per saint with a picture on each page, one being black and white block and the other colored in earth tones. The stories are great! At the end of the book there are listed the names of the saints and which names are related to it. The names of the saints that this book portrays in alphabetical order are:  Agatha, Agnes, Albert, Alice, Andrew, Angels, Anne, Anthony, Augustine, Barbara, Bernard, Bertha, Bridget, Carol, Catherine, Charles, Christina, Clare, Dorothea, Edmund, Edward, Eileen, Elaine, Elizabeth, Ellen, Eric, Francis, Fredrick, Gabriel, George, Gerard, Gertrude, Harry, Helena, Henry, Herbert, Hubert, Hugh, Irene, Isabel, Jack, James, Jane, Jean, Joan, John, Joseph, Julian, Karen, Kathleen, Lawrence, Leo, Louis, Lucy, Luke, Margaret, Marian, Martha, Martin, Mary, Matthias, Matilda, Maureen, Michael, Monica, Nancy, Nicholas, Patrick, Paul, Peter, Philip, Richard, Robert, Rose, Rupert, Stephen, Susanna, Teresa, Thomas, Timothy, Ursula, Veronica, Victor, Vincent, Walter, Wilfrid, William	2005-09-04

It told the lives of these saints in down to earth terms that you could really connect with. At the same time it also told about the miracles that God worked through these saints, explaining why or when God did these miracles and what the results were. I really learned how very practical God can be in working miracles through people to draw people closer to Himself. A WONDERFUL little book!  I can't resist adding what was on the back cover of this book.     \\"When one of the novices in his monastery decided to give up the religious life for one of wealth and luxury, Martin de Porres did everything -- including pass through locked doors -- to convince the young man of his true call.  When given the divine gift of healing, Lutgarde of Aywieres asked God, \\"Why did you give me such a grace, Lord? Take it away, please!\\" Then she impishly added, \\"But give me something getter!\\"  \\"'Bert Ghezzi has rescued mysticism from the midst of trendy spiritualities. In Mystics and Miracles, he shows us how God breaks suddenly and powerfully into the lives of ordinary people -- like you and me -- and changes then forever. If your prayer leaves you longing for more of God, read this book, slowly.' Mike Aquilina, editor, New Covenant\\"  \\"'Bert Ghezzi combines a wonderfully engaging style with real spiritual substance that feeds the soul. I highly recommend it.' Charles J Chaput, O.F.M., Cap. archbishop of Denver\\"  I can only say \\"Amen!\\" to the above paragraphs of these great books!  This book includes stories about the following saints in alphabetical order:  Anthony of Egypt, Anthony of Padua, Apphian, Catherine of Siena, Clare of Assissi, Dominic, Elizabeth of Hungary, Francis of Assissi, Francis of Paola, Francis Xavier, Gertrude the Great, Ignatius of Loyola, Joan of Arc, John Bosco, Lutgarde of Aywieres, Martin de Porres, Padre Pio (Blessed), Patrick, Perpetua, Sabas, Solanus Casey (Venerable), Teresa of Avila, Theresa Margaret, Vincent Ferrer	2005-08-28

This book was copyrighted in 1963, before the changes of Vatican II had much effect on the Catholic culture of America. Many of the stories start out talking about children being in a Catholic school situation, when priests were still principals of the schools, or getting letters from uncles who were priests. They also, in talking about the spirituality of the saints, often included which saints did hard penances, but never explained why this would be something good for the saint to be doing out of love for God Something which now needs to be explained or else it will likely be considered a form of masochism. In this 570 page book there are only about 60, brown and white block print illustrations. To be honest with you, reading these stories became pretty boring.  I would not recommend this book to anyone. However, I have reviewed a number of books on Amazon.com, some of which would be very good to give to youth and/or to read as adults. Please click on \\"See all my reviews\\" to learn more about these books. For those who are trying to get as much information that they can for a certain saint I will list the saints that this book covers in alphabetical order below.  Agnes, Aloysius Gonzaga, Anne, Anthony, Bartholomea Capitanio, Benedict (Holy Moor), Benedict (Patriarch of Western Monks), Bernadette of Lourdes,  Bernardine of Siena, Brigid, Camillus de Lellis, Catherine of Siena, Cecilia, Clare, Columban, Dominic Savio, Dymphna, Elizabeth of Hungary, Elizabeth Seton, Frances of Rome, Frances X.

Indeed, Brian's appreciation for St. Francis comes through every picture he has painted for this book. The paintings take up the whole of the pages. The cover of the book is a good example of the detail and joy which is throughout the paintings of this book. I am not one for enjoying art, but I could not help but look at the art of each page before I read the words on it. Brian then has added about 4 lines of story to each of his 9\\" by 12 inch pages.  It is as though the words on the page - the story - serves as a label for the painting of the page, rather than the painting simply illustrating the words.  Unique to this book is the fact that the words are written in the first person \\"I\\" rather than the third person and it tells a story that  children, as well as adults, are sure to love as much as they love the pictures. It is a wonderfully beautiful book.	2005-08-23

Two pages are devoted to to each saint, accept for Andrew, Peter, Luke and Christopher. Half of the space of each portrayal is devoted to a historical narrative of the saint's life. The remaining space has a picture of the saint from an art museum of the world. I would not recommend it for children. It reads more as a historical text than as true stories. And I believe that adults would more appreciate the pictures in this book. For books that I believe which may have more of an appeal for children please check out my other reviews.<br />The saints who are portrayed in this book are:<br />Andrew.....................Dorothea.................Joan of Arc............Martin of Tours<br />Apollonia...................Eustace...................John the Baptist.....Mary Magdalen<br />Catherine of Siena.....Francis of Assissi.....Joseph..................Michael<br />Cecilia......................George....................Lucy......................Paul<br />Christopher...............Jerome....................Luke......................Peter	2005-08-23

A WONDERFUL little book! <br />  I can't resist adding what was on the back cover of another of Bert Ghezzi's book, \\"Mystics and Miracles: True Stories of Lives Touched by God\\", which is very similar to \\"Miracles of the Saints\\", except that \\"Miracles of the Saints\\" has chapters on Clotilda, Vedast, and Remi that \\"Mystics and Miracles\\" doesn't have, and \\"Mystics and Miracles\\" has chapters on Gertrude the Great, Blessed Padre Pio and Ignatius of Loyola, that \\"Miracles of the Saints\\" doesn't have.

This is a wonderful book with 4 - 10 lines of reading in 2 pages of earth tone pictures. I just want to add to what has already been said on this page about this book. While it looks like it is clearly written for 6 year olds and above, there are some things which would make it better written for older children and adults. The concept of the need for good people to be in hiding from an evil government may be too hard for children to handle well. Also, there is repeatedly brought up that these are legends and may not be true. That may also be too difficult for a child's mind to understand well. Otherwise the story is beautiful.	2005-07-11

Three pages discuss his parents' inability to conceive for many years during which a nearby king abducted and tried to marry the wife/ his eventual mother. (Though that word was not used in the story.) It is a delightful story about Saint Tekla and the many miracles God performed through him. The pictures (of which there are 40 in this 32 page book) are colorful and reflect the Ethiopian culture from which this story comes. Indeed, the pictures were painted by an Ethiopian monk in the 18th century.	2005-07-09

It reads more as a historical text than as true stories. It covers 46 different saints. The saints are covered chronologically from Mary and Joseph to Elizabeth Seton (1774-1821). Each saint is covered in 1-2 pages. The pages are 11 1/2 in. by 9 in., much of the space covered with beautiful pictures.

Not of the muscle and action, but of the heart. It covers 50 saints from St. Ann, the grandmother of Jesus, to St. Casimir of the 15th century. There is 1 - 2 1/2 pages of written text and 1 picture given for each saint. The water color paintings in this book beautifully illustrate the accompanying stories.     It would be too historically based (ie. discussing the historical background of the saint's life) to be meaningful for elementary school children.
