I gave this book to a civilian friend  to read and he refused to believe it as a true account.  He said &quot;This  sort of thing just couldn't happen&quot;   His major problems were in  beliving that the Army would  let itself be caught off guard as they were  and also, as he put it &quot;The slaughter of innocent civilians&quot;.       To say the least Mr. Bowden's work has opened the eyes of at least a few  people to the reality of modern conflicts and the true dangers involved in  this country's peacekeeping efforts around the world. Thank you, Mr. Bowden  for telling their story.    I only hope that whatever movie deal comes out  of this does true credit to the fine Americans who fought there.....and  doesn't turn in to some lame shoot-em-up starring Bruce Willis.

Kudos to Farwell for his insightful biography of one of the most  charismatic figures of the 19th century British Empire.

Little green lizards, none of which seems to have an IQ higher than the  temp of ice water, are masters of the universe yet can't whip the mighty  Earthlings of the 1940s.  Gimme a break!

This book was nothing more than just &quot;OK&quot;.  Brin was able to hold my interest long enough for me to finish it and that's it.  Not totally boring, but definitely not worth a second read.  Here's the story in a nutshell:  Gordon Krantz survives the Doomwar and after a particularly close encounter with death dedicates his life to attempting to restore America to its former greatness by lying to everyone he meets.  His lies cause the deaths of nearly every really strong character in the book.  Yet this deceiver has the nerve to whine on and on about &quot;who will take responsibility?&quot; as though he is the only person left on the blasted planet who is trying to do more than just survive.  What conceit!   Don't buy it, go to the library and check it out.	1998-02-02

With &quot;Bleak Seasons&quot;  It appeared that Cook had lost the taste and feel of the series.  This book returns to the tightly woven scripts of the earlier works.  The thing I like most about this one is the ongoing transformation of Croaker into Captain.  The old Captain must be smiling in his watery grave at how Croaker has been transformed from the sensitive, romantic and thoughtful Annalist to the Hard-boiled, vengeful, scheming and overly secretive Captain of the Last of the Free Companies of Khatovar. The thing I like least is that I don't really care about Murgen.  I tend to read around him, always on the lookout for one of the older brothers to appear.  Maybe it's me, but I just can't get involved with him.  I get the feeling that Cook is straining to bring him into the story but can't find the way.  Maybe it is because Murgen only really gets involved by having the out of body travels using the comatose wizard Smoke to eavesdrop on the unfolding events of the story. Whatever the reason, I'm quite satisfied with the tale as a whole and think that Cook is back on the right track with the series.  Not a page burner but a good read, nevertheless.	1997-10-24

Give me a break!), but this is truly one fine story. I found a one volume set of the first three books of the Black Company lying on a park bench in the rain. I picked it up just so it wouldn't be destroyed and began reading it on the subway.  That was 10 years ago, and I've still got that worn and ragged copy sitting in a drawer in my desk here today.  I used to leave it ON the desk until a friend picked it up and started to read, it took me three weeks to get it back after he had finished, jerk would'nt give it up. Anyway, the story finds a rag-tag, down on its luck, bunch of mercs called the Black Company, struggling for its very survival. And beginning a quest to find its roots.  These are not nice people, but you can't help but be impressed by their ability to overcome the obstacles placed in their way.  The Company has been whittled away over the years by employers trying to use them as cannon fodder and has learned how to fight their battles, not with their arms but with their wits. All of these characters are very well realized, The Company magicians will have you laughing out loud. Even peripheral characters have unique personalities, without resorting to today's common practice  of writing mostly empty 1000 page adjective filled monstrosities. The writing is crisp, thrifty, and well-paced. This is Cook's finest work. Miles ahead of the wimpy Garrett series. And years away from the Dread Empire.  The really intriguing thing is the world they live in, you can't quite place the time-frame, not Medieval, nor Dark Ages, definitely not Renaissance, but still hauntingly familiar. The lexicon of proper and place names is just right for the cynical tone and down-on-your-luck attitude of the story, simple yet highly descriptive.Not your usual twenty syllable fantasy tounge twisters nor the most high, extremely hard to believe, grandfather of all multiple adjective, names and titles seen in most other fantasy works.  Cook is the first writer I've ever read who has been able to use plain old American English as the primary language for his narrative and make it work. Like so, There's a guy called Raven. Why? Remember the great line from True Lies when  Charlton Heston asks the guy why the terrorist calls himself the Sandspider? The guy says &quot;Probably, because it sounds scary.&quot; Well, you don't even get that much information about ol' Raven's name, ever. You as the reader, GET TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION. After six books Cook has never run out of story and had to resort to taking the mystery from his characters by explaining everyday of their lives to readers who really don't want to know. Remember, these are mercenaries. You are not supposed to know their secrets.  If you've got to have every detail spelled out for you then pass this one by. (Critics ignored this series, called it &quot;Not for everyone, ...characters too undefined&quot;) But, if you want a challenging read with great characters that you will remember for years, a world that you cannot stay away from and a story that will keep you waiting patiently for years to be continued (Cook churns out Garrett-trash weekly, it seems, but Black Company stuff is slow in coming) then grab a copy and hold on to it, mine's almost unreadable now.

The gunslinger Roland, is on a quest.  The bad guy is none other than Randall Flag (The Stand), a truly evil character, King's best villian. The story, though is rambling and unstructured.  There is the feeling that the fleshing out of this excellent short work into novel form was rushed.  A few more revisions prior to release and this would have been work worthy of standing with King's best.  All in all, a good read for King fans.

Then,  there's the fact that the planet itself and the life on it are also completely ridiculous. FORGET ALL THAT!  Read it to be swept up in one of the greatest adventure series of all time.  John Carter goes to Barsoom (Mars, to the Martians) rescues the most beautiful woman in the universe and (later in the series) conquers an entire world through the power of his will and the strength of his right arm.  Handsome, powerful heroes, beautiful half naked captive princesses just panting to be rescued, Villians, so evil you want to go back in time to strangle their parents, Big ugly friends, (What are you laughing at, remember Chewbacca?) strange beasts, stranger aliens, wierd science, epic battles, betrayals, great reunions. This one's got it all.  The best of Burroughs' body of work, the most action packed series from the true master of the action story.  Edgar Rice Burroughs is the creator of Tarzan.

Don't argue with me, go find The Black Company and read it, Now! Don't start with this one though. Not that it's not a great book, it's just that you won't have a clue as to what is going on. The cover of this book should have a warning notice- Full Familiarity With The Black Company Required. If you are a fan, get ready for a great story. This is the tale of the search for The Silver Spike, the object containing the essence of the defeated Dominator. The old characters here are just like you remember them, Croaker, One-eye, Goblin and all the rest with a few new ones thrown in.

Little spurts of action followed by all your favorite Heinlein characters sitting around drinking, recuperating and  explaining why the totally useless action sequence just occurred.

Everybody here is way overarmed and undersmart. Another alternate world, wow. If this is the vision of the future of Libertarianism run rampant, it's no wonder none of their candidates can get elected. The one aspect of this work which bothers me most is that HUMANS DON&quot;T ACT THIS WAY! Science fiction writers are the most guilty of all, in that when they contrive their brave new worlds they try to make man into a different animal without explaining why he would be different. If Mr. Smith thinks a little bout of libertarianism will change human nature, then he should think again. Escapism is fine, but give us a break.

Didn't matter, great reading. The protagonist, a female Frank (Frankenstein) government agent in a future filled with genetically altered beings, gets caught up in a web of intrigue leading to an unexpected conclusion involving covert alien subversion and government involvement/cover-up. The Franks aren't supposed to exist any longer, making the agents job even more difficult. The other types of characters are a genetically souped-up mish-mash of humans and animals, bred for a past war and now the new second class citizens.  Human-like dogs, lions, bears, rabbits, rats and others await in this tense story that keeps you guessing who is pulling the strings until you come face to face with a truly disgusting alien presence. And when you find out that the agent has to face a rogue Frank near the end, you can't wait for the inevitable showdown. Properly paced, with enough future high tech to keep just about every fan reading hungrily till the end.  After reading this one I immediately went out and bought every book by this author that I could track down. Not a single one has dissappointed me. The future theme that Swann envisions in his novels (everything he has written so far is set in this future) is gritty, bleak, paranoid and thoroughly enjoyable.

Williams fan, but this book was a major dissapointment.  I hope the sequel to this poor work shows some of the old Williams' style.  The concept of Plasma as the means to power in this world is UNrealized. Constantine is a particularly UNimpressive hero in an UNhappy world of petty power mongers struggling UNmightily to conquer only each other while the rest of the planet watches UNinterestedly. You will also read without interest.  A lot of UNs is the best way to summarize this  UNmemorable work from a writer who used to produce compelling plots and characters that meant somthing to the reader. The female protagonist follows Williams' now common formula of the person who acts primarily in their own self interest until they reach the moment when they are forced to choose between themselves and someone they love.

If you are looking for a late night page turner, then look no further because, in this book you meet Dr. Hannibal Lector for the first time!  That's right, The Silence of The Lambs is a sort of sequel to this book. I don't think this one has gotten anywhere near the credit it deserves. Read this book!  It is truly scary. The characters here are well fleshed-out, not the usual hard-drinking-cop-with-three-ex-wives catches-loony-serial-killer.  The FBI agent tracking the &quot;Dragon&quot; is a man who realizes that the only reason he has so much success, (He's the guy who caught Dr. Lector) is because he's just one flick of the switch from becoming a serial killer himself. The &quot;Dragon&quot; is a truly tormented soul.  Harris has always been able to generate villians you can sympathize with, while you still cheer when they &quot;get it in the end&quot;. The history of the killer drags a bit, but you are soon grabbed by the hair and yanked back into the story. Read it, and you'll end up reading it again and again	1997-03-01
