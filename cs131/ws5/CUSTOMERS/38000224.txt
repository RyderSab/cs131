I found this book difficult to be enthusiastic about.  It is definitely the most controversial of Wilkinson's books so far.  Wilkinson maintains that in order to be rewarded in Heaven we must have good works.  It seems like he is saying that we must have rewards in Heaven in order to be satisfied.  This is off the mark.  We should be striving for God's will and do as He would have us to, but not only to get rewards.  The books reasonings seem selfish.  There is little information about faith. I expected much better.	2003-02-04

Materia cannot be the woman that James wants her to be, hence their family is doomed from the start.  His actions have a longterm tragic effect on their children.

In my reading, I could not decide if I was reading a book about math or a book about psychology.  There is a lot of extra information about other mathematicians and their works that I found irrelevant to the point of the book.  A simple focus on Nash, with the story of his life is what I had expected.  However, what I got was more information than I was interested.  Stick to the movie.  It overdramatizes the life of Nash, but it's a lot easier to follow.	2003-01-31
