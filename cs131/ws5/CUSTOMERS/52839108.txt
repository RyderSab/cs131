I used to spend at least a full day putting together PowerPoint presentations for our church service (both song service and for the pastor's sermon.) A friend bought the Oxygen starter kit for me as a gift, and now it only takes me an hour or less to do everything! I like how they've already designed different slides with the same theme, so all you have to do is add the text rather than having to reposition everything yourself to make it more visually interesting.<br />In addition, the artwork is beautiful and I've had many people come up to me after the service saying that they found it uplifting. My only complaint is that I didn't find this sooner! :)	2004-07-17

Its armies had no rivals and its conquests were unchallenged. And yet, the gospel of Jesus Christ, proclaimed by mostly uneducated, unarmed men and women, turned that pagan society upside down. What made the gospel so strong? Why was it such good news? <br />In &quot;Faith Against the Odds,&quot; Mark Finley and Steven Mosley take a historical look at just how the gospel has been able to shine despite powerful attempts to stifle it. They look especially at some little-known heroes of the faith whose lives lit up some of the darkest days of the Middle Ages. In doing so, they proclaim that the power of the gospel is still available to transform your life today. This book will show that God has fantastic plans for you--plans you desperately need to know about in order to have a faith against the odds.	2004-07-04

They tend to fall apart when problems hit. They have a difficult time facing the crises which life inevitably brings. Why? They have no &quot;faith roots.&quot; Their Christian experience is shallow. Would you like to go deeper? Do you long for a vital experience with God? Then &quot;Faith Roots&quot; is for you. <br />Mark Finley and Steven Mosley delve into the deeper spiritual life in each chapter. You will find yourself drawn to God in remarkable ways as you read these pages. Faith Roots is much more than a book to read--it is a doorway to a new experience with God.	2004-07-04

Do you ever find that the closer you try to get to God, the further He seems to drift away?<br />The search for God is a big part of what makes human life meaningful. And people are embarking on that search all over the world, in all kinds of fascinating ways. But sometimes we run into barriers in our search for God--big barriers that block the road and hang us up. In &quot;Breaking Through Barriers to God,&quot; Mark Finley and Steve Mosley look at some of these roadblocks--the problem of evil, the exclusive claims of Christianity, the demands of belonging to a church, the events at the end of the world. For some people even the cross and the need for forgiveness can be a barrier to a discovering God as a Friend and loving Savior.<br />Through the real stories of ordinary people who have had extraordinary encounters with God, this book points out how to break through these barriers to a rewarding life with God.	2004-07-04

But even though it's called &quot;reality TV&quot; it isn't actually like the challenges we face in real life where we have to live each day. <br />In The Ultimate Survivor, Mark Finley, host of the international It Is Written telecast, talks about how to survive some of real life's biggest challenges--such things as divorce, depression, or the death of a loved one. He points to the spiritual resources that can make you a confident survivor in real life. The life of faith and the active life aren't on opposite ends of the spectrum. They function best together. Our faith gives our actions great potential. And it's these actions, in turn, which intensify our faith. Faith that is expressed deepens. And that, says, Finley, is the ultimate secret of resilience. God has a great plan for you to develop resilience. He can make you an overcomer. He can help you prosper in times of adversity. He can strengthen you on the inside. He can enable you to do all things.	2004-07-04

Yet many--though surrounded by people on all sides--feel utterly isolated and alone.<br />Most of us have learned that loneliness isn't cured by living in a crowd of strangers. It only goes away when we have people around who care about us--people with whom we can share our lives. In fact, loneliness disappears if we can find even one such person who truly cares. Just one.<br />Millions have discovered that one person to be none other than Jesus Christ. In a growing friendship with Him, their loneliness vanishes. But in this relationship they also find a new security--a new assurance unknown before. An assurance that they are accepted unconditionally. An assurance of their personal salvation. An assurance that they are of infinite value. And yes, an assurance that they will never be lonely again.	2004-07-03

What are the unmet needs of your life that drive you to find satisfaction in possessions or pleasure, achievements or addictions, in endlessly seeking something-anything-to fill that undefined void inside? <br />Are you trying to meet an inner need with something on the outside-with something material? Are you trying to meet a spiritual need with something physical? <br />We human beings are ever so needy. We come into this world a bundle of seemingly limitless and urgent needs. And as we grow and mature, we become aware of some of those needs. But not all. We so easily believe that just the right amount of money, just the right relationship, just the right kind of thrill or pleasure, will leave us satisfied. <br />In this brief but concentrated little book, Pastor Mark Finley of It Is Written Television points to the one and only way any of us can ever become truly satisfied. <br />For it's those inner needs-for peace and love, faith and hope, assurance and self-worth-that cry out most urgently to be satisfied. And those needs won't be met in a whole lifetime of frantically chasing after things and pleasure. <br />What is it then that can leave us totally and forever satisfied? These pages will show that this is the wrong question. For it's not &quot;What can satisfy?&quot; It's &quot;Who can satisfy?&quot; Come...and meet Him!	2004-07-03

An insightful book for anyone who wants to learn more about the \\"Left Behind\\" phenomenon!<br />What I liked about this book is the fact that everything is based on the Bible and historical facts.<br />--------------------------------------------<br />This book does not seem to be related to the movie link that Amazon.com has on this page by the way...and I don't see a description, so I'll type it up for anyone who wants to learn more:<br />Will millions of Christians suddenly vanish someday? <br />A careful investigation of the rapture theory, which forms the basis for the \\"Left Behind\\" fantasy, reveals that Scripture does not teach a secret coming of Christ. The authors explore the checkered history of Cyrus Scofield, editor of the famous Scofield Reference Bible, and show how the rapture theory originated in ecstatic visions and utterances in Scotland around 1830. <br />But what does the Bible really teach about the end? <br />In this book, the authors wrestle with such questions as: <BR>* Is there a mysterious 'gap' in the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9? <BR>* Were the promises to Israel conditional?<BR>* How will the final events play out in America? <BR>* Who is the antichrist? <br />The future may not be kind to the uninformed. Exposing the deliberate cover-up of Bible teaching about last-day events and the return of Jesus, this book will give the reader a working understanding of Bible prophecy.	2004-07-03

This book was required reading for my Public Relations seminar class. As a p.r. major, I wondered why this was assigned, since it seems to do nothing but malign the whole industry. As I continued to read, however, I began to  see why it was assigned: We as public relations professionals need to know  what the opposition is saying about us.<br />This book is great because it  shows p.r. people what NOT to do when practicing the trade. As stated  before in the previous reviews, this book is one-sided, but, as you can  tell by the title, that's what it sought to be. However, it's unfortunate  that the author's didn't explore all the positive aspects of public  relations, since many p.r. campaigns help keep the U.S. economy healthy.  <br />So, as I said before, every p.r. professional should read this book to  get a feel for the history of public relations, but they should also take  into consideration that this doesn't cover the good aspects. Just as the  book said public relations people only show the positive attributes of  their clients, this book only shows the negatives of the industry. <br />Toxic  Sludge is very well-written and informative, and I commend the authors for  a book that makes the required reading list.	1999-07-05
