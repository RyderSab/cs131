But my friend has recommended good books in the past and this one is certainly not an exception.<br />Vivid characters with different personalities cleverly mixed together. You have Cade Nyland who's determined to win the rally and on the surface he doesn't seem to care about much else. Then there's TZ Blake who has inherited a car, an auto repair shop and a debt from her aunt. Together they will enter the rally in TZ's car, after a little begging from Cade's side. But TZ's vibrating '67 Mustang seems to have a mind of its own and without a real navigator this can go wrong, very wrong.<br />A fun and sexy book where most of the story takes place on a road rally, in a car that has a personality on its own. The book consists of quick comments, fun action and a clear attraction between the different character that makes you smile from the very first page. It's definitely a must real and you're guaranteed to laugh. A most talented writer who will hopefully have another book out soon. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next!	2004-04-27

And when I started, I simply couldn't put it down.<BR>It all takes place in the begining of the 13th century when Earl Hugh Dulonget of Hillcrest's uncle dies and the will says he must marry a girl called Willa. He goes to see her, but leaves after calling her a peasant. Soon he realizes he must marry her. Refusing to listen to any advice, he sets his mind to making her need him and that way she would forgive him and marry him. It is harder than he thought and if she would reconsider, would they live happily ever after?<br />The characters in Lynsay's books are strong individuals, both the males and females. But she also makes them very realistic and clever. The females are independant, but still emotional and caring. Although this book is hillarious the characters are never stupid, which makes her novels different from many others! She has her own way of mixing history, romance, humour and realism that works wonderfully and I'm very impressed with the works I've read by her so far! Can't wait to read more!!<BR>I love this book, it's such a great read. Wonderful entertainment if you love romance novels or rarely read them. Filled with humor and strong minded characters makes it a huge hit.

Usually I'm not a heavy romance reader, but stick with fiction and thrillers. But boy am I glad I read this one!!! <BR>It's hysterical! I don't know how many times I laughed out loud reading this book nor how many thought of me as nuts when I did so at home, on the bus... I simply had to take it everywhere with me, only to find out what would happen next.<br />You have a 24 years old woman, Valoree, born a lady, who has been dressing up as a boy and managed to fool her crew as the captain of a pirate ship, mainly to get revenge for her brother's death. When she goes to claim her heir, Ainsley Castle, with a drunken as her aunt and the pirates as servent and dressed up as a lady herself, she's told that in order to inherit she needs to be married to a nobleman and with child before turning 25. With little time to solve the task, her crew decides to help her find a man to marry. But Valoree is one stubborn lady...<br />It's always something happening to make you laugh, and at the same time curious about what will happen next. Once I'd finished this one, I had to start on another one of hers, which I also loved. Hopefully I'll get to read yet another one soon!!<BR>I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a good book. Lynsay is a brilliant writer!!	2003-03-06

Two females are shot in a bank robery, and the husband of one of them escapes from prison. Now he wants to get his revenge, but not by taking it out directly on the police officers. He wants them to suffer as he is, and wanting nothing by revenge, he's going after their families...<BR>Sandford is a master of writing about different motives for the killings in all his thrillers. Previously I've read about someone killing because (s)he feels (s)he have to do it, another time I read about a much more dangerous motivation, the profit. In this book, Sudden Prey, the main character, Lucas Davenport, is facing the most simple and purest motivation, which is revenge. But can his killer-instinct, fast thinking and intelligence help him to solve this case?<BR>Sandford has the ability of making you so curious about what will happen, that you simply can't put the book away. You have to finish it right away. And if you enjoy the Prey series, this book is a must. Certainly one his best. A great book also recommended to anyone who loves to read, and those who like thillers.	2003-02-04

Henrik Ibsen in one of the most famous Norwegian writers thoughout the world. And he is known for his plays where he gives a critical view upon the society.<BR>In this play, everything happens around the main character Nora. She is innocent, naiv and has no education at all, just like most women of her social rank had at that time. Her husband, Torvald, is well known in the city, and his wife is just a \\"doll\\". She isn't supposed to have opinions on anything, just smile and look pretty in this male dominated world.<BR>When Torvald Helmer finds out that his wife has \\"stole\\" money from her father to be able to pay for a health insitution for him, he's shocked. Nora, not understand what she might have done wrong, was only trying to help her husband, and yet protect her dying father. She wakes up, starting feel independant, wanting to discover herself...<BR>Ibsen was a master of showing different sides of the social levels, and giving a critic view on what he didn't like. He has done it yet again, focusing on the marriage of these two people.

Wuthering Heights is one of oldest romance novels and stands as a classic in litterature history.<br />All through the book you will meet great contrasts that to a certain extent can explain the actions. Wuthering heights is the land of storm and wilderness compared to the quiet and more passive Thruscross Grange where one might think it's more appropriate for children to grow up. The Earnshaw family lives on Wuthering Heights while the Linton family is from Thruscross Grange. When those two contrasts meets with the children of these two families, the conflicts starts. Catherine and Heathcliff are drawn to eachother from the begining and their passion is powerful and destructive. There's love, hate and suffering, but written in a poetic somewhat advanced language and it's echanting how you get caught up with this book.<br />Sad is it that Emily Brontë died the year after its publication at the age of thirty... But with this novel and her poems, she is one of the most well known female English writers of the 18th century.<br />You will surely miss out on something great by not reading this book. I warmly recommend Wuthering Heights to everyone who loves to read. It is truly a unique piece of writing!	2003-01-29

First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...<br />This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.<br />The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.<br />Charlotte Brontë, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Brontë sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16.	2003-01-29

When Mrs. Alving is told that it was most likely inherited, she tells her son the secret too, and that changes his view on his father.

He was very critical of the society and most, if not all, of his books often has a somewhat hidden story where he debates social matters and also morals. He use symbols and mostly contrasts to give the play a certain atmosphare and meaning. I believe this is one of Ibsen's greatest plays and strongly recommend it to anyone.	2003-01-29

You can always find huge books about philosophy and after a few pages you're totally lost, and have to start over again several times. But this one is different. Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<br />I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.	2003-01-29

Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<BR>I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.	2003-01-11

Jeffery Deaver is a master of adding twists and turns to the story and specially to the end of his thillers, just as in this book.<BR>Tate Collier and Aaron Mathews are both brilliant with words. One used to be an excellent trial lawyer, and the other is a brilliant psychologist. Mathews is out to get Collier and his family, and is determined to not let anything stop him. Colliers daughter, Megan, disappears and it looks as she ran away. Now Collier and his ex-wife, Bett McCall have to work together to try to stop him.<BR>A psychopath is gifted with a glib tongue can be as deadly as anything, and it doesn't make it any better when he's seeking violence and more important... he's looking for revenge!<br />Maybe not Deaver's best book, but still worth to read if you love thrillers. To some this one might be a disappointment after reading other of his books.	2003-01-10

Wuthering Heights is one of oldest romance novels and stands as a classic in litterature history.<BR>All through the book you will meet great contrasts that to a certain extent can explain the actions. Wuthering heights is the land of storm and wilderness compared to the quiet and more passive Thruscross Grange where one might think it's more appropriate for children to grow up. The Earnshaw family lives on Wuthering Heights while the Linton family is from Thruscross Grange. When those two contrasts meets with the children of these two families, the conflicts starts. Catherine and Heathcliff are drawn to eachother from the begining and their passion is powerful and destructive. There's love, hate and suffering, but written in a poetic somewhat advanced language and it's echanting how you get caught up with this book.<BR>Sad is it that Emily Bront died the year after its publication at the age of thirty... But with this novel and her poems, she is one of the most well known female English writers of the 18th century.<BR>You will surely miss out on something great by not reading this book. I warmly recommend Wuthering Heights to everyone who loves to read. It is truly a unique piece of writing!	2003-01-09

Since I hadn't seen the movie before reading the book, it gave such a powerful impression. An amazing story that have been very well written by Keneally.

His way of adding twists and caputring you right from the start is only a couple of the things that makes him great. The killer of Eyes of Prey can, to a certain extent, even be compared to Hannibal Lector. The gross almost rituals and the horrible acts.  Sandfords way of describing the way the characters think, their desires and their way of acting is unique!<BR>Once you're started reading the book you're trapped. No way to get out until you're done with the book. Highly recommended to anyone who loves other Prey-books, and thrillers!!	2003-01-03
