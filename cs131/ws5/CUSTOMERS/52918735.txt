But I found that aspect all too confusing and pointless. I did like the heroine, but her ability to see beyond the normal senses plays no part in the tale -- it's mostly her intuitiveness that helps her uncover the murderer.	2005-09-17

US	52918735	R3RVPGOWIIR5DY	1419165046	703962517	The Grey Room	Books	3	9	9	N	Y	A Marginal Recommendation	The Plot:  During a 1920's house party at the ancestral estate of Sir Walter Lennox, the sordid reputation of the unused Grey Room is a topic of discussion. An ancestor of Sir Walter's died in the room under mysterious circumstances -- although she was in her 80's so how mysterious is that? Years later a robust young woman meets a similar fate, being found in the morning looking peacefully from bed with dead eyes. To debunk the myth one of the house party connives to sleep in the room, and a repetition of the previous death occurs. Sir Walter's nephew talks him into hiring a detective to uncover the truth. But before the truth comes to light a number of other deaths occur.<br /><br />A Review: I enjoy mysteries with a supernatural twist, so I did enjoy reading this obscure book. The ending was a bit of a let-down, but not unexpectedly. The writing style is pleasant, although there is way too much of dinner conversations that drone on for pages, mostly filled with speculations about the \\"here-after\\" and lots of religious clap-trap, since one of the characters is a parson. It's easy to skip over these parts and just read the meat of the story without missing anything.<br /><br />A note: While I appreciate being able to find this book as reprinted by Kessinger Publishing (other editions I found online from antiquarian booksellers were way too expensive), I am disappointed in the bare-bones presentation. There is no modern introduction to the novel, and not even an original date of publication. In addition, the typesetting is pretty sloppy. There were numerous typos -- many of them where a small u was replaced with a small n, and vice-versa.	2005-08-07

Flight Lieutenant Jasper Doyle is an Intelligence Officer at the base, from which RAF bombers depart for occupied Europe and Germany. Prior to joining the Air Force Doyle was with Scotland Yard and while going over some photographs taken during a bombing raid on Berlin, he sees something that stirs his detective's soul: in the glare of a flare, a shape that might be a body can be made out on the film. Since one of the crew from the bomber taking the photo is AWOL, Doyle suspects foul play. Between debriefings of bomber crews, he sets out to uncover the facts about the missing man and the possible body that was dropped with a load of bombs on the German capital.<br /><br />Review: Lakin's writing style is an easy one, and the setting is one you don't find in a British mystery too often. There is a plot twist at the end, as well as a bit of espionage and romance thrown in. The denouement is a bit convoluted and confusing, but on the whole it was an enjoyable read that evoked a time and place for me.	2005-05-26

There are three volumes in this set, each containing valuable reviews and articles on the writings of others of the period.<br /><br />I enjoy reading Golden Age mysteries, but finding information about the more obscure ones isn't that easy. Finding many of the books is easy thanks to Amazon and eBay, but are they any good?<br /><br />Boucher's opinion is one I trust. He has steered me towards some of my favorite mysteries. (I don't understand his high opinion of Craig Rice, though.) So these volumes have been very helpful to me.<br /><br />Vol I and Vol II are similar -- reviews of new mysteries published between 1942 and 1947. Vol I has slightly longer articles on each reviewed book. Vol II reprints Boucher's weekly review colum, so the actual reviews are short and sweet. (Well, not so sweet if he didn't like the book -- see below.) Vol III is a mixture of reviews on sci-fi, mysteries and other articles. All three books are available through the Ramble House web site.<br /><br />Boucher must have been a quick reader, plowing through hundreds of books submitted to him every week. Some he was enthusiastic about: his review of \\"Evidence of Things Seen\\" by Elizabeth Daly reads \\"Henry Gamadge, usually the impersonal expert, can hardly be impersonal when the evidence seems to prove either that his wife is mad or that lean brown ghosts can kill. Miss Daly's always skilled writing carries an extra emotional punch in this uncanny tale, cannily told.\\" Boucher told it like he saw it, too, but even his negative reviews don't sting too much: on \\"Death At Dakar\\" by Kerry O'Neil -- \\"American girl reporter foils Nazi quest for death ray formula in Rio and Dakar. The local color is hot from the guidebook, and the preposterous dialogue makes the Rover Boys sound like Clifford Odets. Perfect ammunition for the snobs who claim mysteries are execrable writing.\\" OK, maybe that stung the author a bit. But it probably saved people the trouble of finding out a book was bad themselves.<br /><br />The reviews are obviously of a time, but the editor, Francis M. Nevins, has included notes to let a reader of this day know what Boucher was referring to in the 1940's. (There are many reviews of stories with Nazi spys as protagonists, of course.)<br /><br />So, if you are searching for old books to buy, get a copy of these books first to start your research.nition for the snobs who claim mysteries are execrable writing.\\" OK, maybe that stung the author a bit.

But as he gets deeper into the haunting and its reason, David isn't so sure there is anything to debunk. But there is an obvious living villain at work also, as the deaths of people involved in the case start to mount.<br /><br />Written in the 1960's, the book fits the mold of the Golden Age mystery, and is worth seeking out, with a nice twist at the end that sort of explains a lot of things I was puzzled about when I decided who was behind the dastardly goings-on.	2005-04-23

His reviews from his years with the San Francisco Chronicle have been compiled in two volumes by Francis M. Nevins and published by Ramble House in 2002. These are great volumes to peruse while looking for other golden age mysteries to read (and avoid.)<br /><br />Having read thousands of other mysteries, Boucher was qualified to write some of his own. \\"Irregulars\\" has some of the elements of the typical golden age mystery: a house where murder occurs and all the suspects are gathered under one roof for the duration, an impossible crime, and a plucky heroine. It also has elements that I can't resist:  charts showing suspects and alibis, a diagram of the house, graphic representations of the clues and solution. The only thing missing from the Carrol & Graf paperback edition I have is a crime map on the back cover.<br /><br />If you are prepared to have your leg pulled for 250-odd pages, dig in.	2005-04-01

If you enjoy the golden age mysteries then you will probably enjoy this.<br /><br />From the IPL back cover review by Dorothy L. Sayers, The Sunday Times, 10 June 1934:<br /><br />\\"Its background is Germany, immediately after Hitler's rise to power, and this gives it a strong topical interest. Periods of political revolution and reform are usually confused and puzzling periods, and the book faithfully reflects this aspect of its setting. Murders occur, and the solution of the problem is made more difficult and embarassing for the police owing to the fact that the names of prominent Nazis are involved...<br /><br />  \\"There are sinister hints of hidden intrigue, lurid flashes of light on the persecution of Jews, grim little scenes of blood and squalor mingled with the glitter of nightclub life, and over it all hangs the atmosphere of suspicion and insecurity which is bound to accompany national upheavals.<br /><br />\\"The opening episode, which gives its name to the story, has a queerness and fancifulness which slightly suggest the work of another mystery writer, John Dickson Carr . . . One has clearly the sensation of moving in a kind of phantasmagoria in which nothing is really astonishing and nothing really inevitable...<br /><br /> \\"...recommended to those who like something out of the ordinary.\\"<br /><br />This paperback edition has an introduction by Douglas G.

Books	4	9	10	N	N	Hilton channels Christie	From the Dover edition: \\"Was It Murder?\\" like \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips,\\" takes place in that most traditional and confounding of English settings, the public school. Colin Revell, impudent Oxonian and sometime sleuth, returns to his alma mater Oakington to puzzle over a schoolboy's \\"accidental\\" death. The accidents multiply in frequency and horror as Colin idly pokes about the Gothic quads, and the tightly modulated suspense ripens with a generous foretaste of Hilton's later acclaimed talent: finely perceived, individual characters, overwhelming atmosphere, and full complement of adventure and romance.<br /><br />From reviewer: I must admit it has been many years since I read this, picking it up because \\"Random Harvest\\" and \\"Lost Horizon\\" are favorites, and I enjoy mysteries. So, my rating is based mostly on not having a bad feeling about it, but not having a great one, either.<br /><br />P.S. This book was originally released in 1931 under the title \\"Murder At School\\" under a pen name of Glen Trevor.	2005-03-26

A peripheral character in other Vale stories, Murray has a classic inferiority complex (and without Grandmother Vale's help, too.) There is a belief-stretching occurance early on that the entire plot hangs on, and if you can go with it, the book satisfies.<br /><br />\\"Home Port\\" is mostly not about the Boston goings-on of the family, though, following Murray during an extended period of time away from his suffocating upbringing. Charlotte makes an appearance, but is not central. Her story was so much more interesting (and she herself so much more so), that there is disappointment in this tale for those who became engrossed and cheered for Charlotte through her trials.<br /><br />An okay read (since Prouty's style is pleasing) in the saga (which also includes \\"White Fawn\\" and \\"Lisa Vale.\\")	2005-03-22

Also their neighbors Eve and her son (who is secrectly loved by the niece) and the son's fiance. McCloy was a prolific writer in the 1940's and her books flow at a nice clip.

Like when we were in grammar school and had to read a book, then submit a review with colored covers made out of heavy paper (well, I did, anyway.)<br /><br />Somewhat a mystery, Carr is too besotted with the historical time he sets his story in. I admit I skimmed the sword-fighting parts, since they didn't seem necessary to the plot. I found the book interesting mostly for some of the details I just faulted it for.

The pre-war destination playground is deserted now except for diplomats and oil refinery workers, who often see their efforts sunk by German U-boats that attack departing tankers. When one of the local wire services correspondents dies, Stark sees a chance to make some money. Having worked for the same company in the past, Stark offers his services and is hired to replace the dead man. But, unlike the police, Stark doesn't think his predecessor died by accident. As he looks further into the mystery, he encounters a rival correspondent, an enigmatic police officer, the mistress of the dead man, and other local residents who all seem to have a stake in the dead man's activities.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Not as much fun to read as some of McCloy's other stories, this mystery does hold your attention, although the ending felt a bit rushed and anti-climatic. The title comes from a poem of the same name by Christina Rossetti: \\"We must not look at Goblin men, We must not buy their fruits, Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry, thirsty roots?\\"  It's great title, and sort of fits the plot at least.

Carr's mysteries can be clever and interesting, or contrived and tedious. This one is in the first category. The murder takes place during a staged performance to prove the unrealiability of witnesses. And of course, everyone sees things differently. It's one of those mysteries where you'll be flipping back through it to see how you could possibly have missed the obvious clues.	2004-12-05

So the report of his murder was no disappointment. But it was disconcerting when gossip columnists daily recorded his activities:  escorting beautiful women to Manhattan's most glamorous nightclubs, writing songs, and otherwise behaving as a person very much alive. Crack magazine writer William Deacon set out to unravel the mystery and quickly discovered that he, Deacon, had his own problems about staying alive.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Boucher review, May 1960:  \\"Brean returns ... to the kind of crime-fantasia in which he first made his mark -- the grandly improbable and apparently impossible situation, with seeming overtones of the supernatural or at very least the paranormal...BRILLHART (is) a book that only the most incurious clod could fail to finish in one long sitting...a who-, how-, and whydunit in the classic grand manner!\\"<br /><br />Well, guess I'm a clod since I didn't finish it in one sitting.

Here is the blurb from the cover of the IPL Library of Crime Classics edition (which has an entertaining 1986 forward from Baxt included): \\"This is a detective story, and unlike any other that you have read. No brief review can attempt to convey its quality. I merely note that it deals with a Manhattan sub-culture wholly devoid of ethics or morality, that staid readers may well find it 'shocking,' that it is beautifully plotted and written with elegance and wit, that I have certain reservations concerning its strict technical fairness, and that you must under no circumstances miss it. This is announced as the first of a trilogy about the dual minority (Negro and homosexual) police detective Pharoah Love; and I wish I could simply estivate until the second appears.\\" -- Anthony Boucher, June 12, 1966.<br /><br />Well, Boucher generally knows his stuff (even though I'm not sure about that \\"estivate\\" thing in there, which looks like it means \\"to spend the summer in a torpid state.\\") His recommendations are rarely off the mark, and this book is not one of his rare misses. Of course times have changed in the last 40 years, so not many readers -- staid or not -- will be that shocked. Amused, probably, though.	2004-10-16

But this book doesn't satisfy. It's mostly a rehash of the other information printed about her, with long, rambling paragraphs about people she associated with during her Hollywood days and after.  The main problems with this book (besides the fact that it commits the unforgivable sin -- for a movie star bio, at least -- of not including one photograph! -- are the poor writing style and terrible production value. An example of the latter is that you encounter the first of many (many) typos in the fifth line on page one, where the authors recount how Goddard's grandparents moved to Salt Lady City. Later on we learn that Goddard's last husband &quot;because a U.S. citizen&quot; -- maybe he &quot;became&quot; one?  The writing is fairly annoying too, with certain words being overused -- one of which is &quot;unique.&quot; As well as being overused,the authors make the mistake of using modifiers for it, such as &quot;most unique,&quot; &quot;very unique,&quot; and &quot;quite unique.&quot; Professional writers should know that something is either unique, or it is not. It cannot be a little unique, or a lot unique.<br />There are also many errors that any fan of Goddard notices right away: the name of Ray Milland's character in &quot;Kitty&quot; is given as &quot;March,&quot; although it is &quot;Marcy,&quot; actress Vera Zorina's first name is listed as &quot;Zera,&quot; actress Eva Gabor's name is listed as &quot;Ava,&quot; Goddard's 1940 film &quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; is referenced as &quot;The Ghost Catchers.&quot; You get the idea.<br />In the end, I enjoyed the book after I got out some paper and a pen to keep track of all these factual, grammatical and typographical errors. Thankfully, I was reading a library copy. You are warned.	2001-07-27

When I happened on this and a few of his other mysteries, I was naturally anxious to read them. They don't disappoint (although they don't soar to the heights of the three books mentioned above.) This one, involving a cult, is fun to read and has some impossible crimes to solve, in keeping with the Golden Age.<br />(By the way, the other two books in that series were &quot;A Blunt Instrument&quot; by Georgette heyer, and &quot;Cat of Many Tails&quot; by Ellery Queen.)	2000-10-20

The story concerns a woman who seems to have the gift of pre-cognition, but sees things that aren't always pleasant.

Of fevers, chills or other ills; But Wilders walk away.<br /><br />That's the little ditty they all sing in the quaintly picturesque New England village of Wilder's Lane. That's part of the mystery too, of course. You see, from pre-Revolutionary War times on, members of the Wilder family never die; they walk away -- disappear into thin air -- forever. Footprints on a deserted beach may simply stop. A man who enters an office building is never seen again.<br /><br />Teen-aged Ellen Wilder is waiting for a bus when she walks away. Well, not quite. Reynold Frame, a photojouranlist on assignment from Life, finds a fresh grave with the murdered girl in it.<br /><br />Frame begins an investigation.

Knowing the 'secret' as you read still doesn't diminish its impact, but I'm jealous of those readers in 1933 who had the advantage of mystery as they read on.	1997-11-03

A great little murder story that is fun to re-read every few years. The hero gets a chance to relive  the previous year, right up to the point where he may have committed a murder. Set against the Broadway stage district of the 1940's.	1997-11-03

Knowing the most important plot device ahead  doesn't spoil it, but if you don't know it (and haven't seen the wonderful movie), you'll get a special delight from this great story.	1997-11-03

If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading &quot;She&quot;, you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread &quot;She&quot; instead.	1997-11-01

Murders take place in empty streets covered with snow, unmarked by footprints other than the victim's and in a &quot;locked&quot; room. Dr. Fell even gives an extended lesson in impossible murders during the investigation.	1997-11-01
US	52918735	R2B32BM1ZB72HJ	0892440686	263695513	The Uninvited	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A ghostly murder mystery - but buyer beware	If you've seen the movie and know the plot twist, you'll still enjoy the book. Some interesting sub-plots were dropped from the screenplay and they add to the supernatural atmosphere of the story. Picturing Ray Milland as Roderick, Ruth Hussey as Pamela and Gail Russell as Stella as you read helps, since the three actors were perfectly cast.<br /><br /> The story follows a brother and sister who buy an old seaside house in England and begin to investigate the spooky occurances they experience. They delve into the history of the house and its past inhabitants as the haunting becomes more intense, figuring that by discovering the reason behind it, they can lay the spirit to rest. The story unfolds as both a neat little English mystery as well as a chilling ghost story.<br /><br />Be sure you are buying the novel and not the play by Tim Kelley. That's okay in itself, but is nowhere as good as Macardle's book; sometimes it's not easy to tell here on this site which version you are reading about.	1997-10-30
US	52918735	R2N0CFKF9AIYA	0930330307	988964342	Rim of the Pit	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Can ghosts commit murders? And can murderers fly?	A snowbound group of people in the north woods must deal with a supernatural killer unleashed by a seance they hold. Locked rooms and impossible murders seem to be explainable only by believing that the dead can come back to take revenge on the living. Footprints that begin and end in the middle of unbroken snowfields, the appearance of a Wendigo that can swoop down on its victims, someone killed by someone possessed by a dead man -- these are some of the puzzles adventurer Rogan Kinkaid is faced with in this classic whodunit/howwasitdun. (Also worth seeking is Talbot's first novel with Kinkaid, \\"The Hangman's Handyman.\\" Not as atmospheric as \\"Rim,\\" it features a nice puzzle concerning an ancient curse.)	1997-10-30
