I am from Meridian, thus my interest in Mr. Clarke's book.  Interesting idea for a book, all the violence associated with Meridian, a small city in eastern Mississippi, best known recently as the source of most of the Klan members who killed the civil rights workers in Philadelphia in the early 60's.<br /><br />The latter part of the book about that crime and other lesser known  incidents is interesting.  In fact, the Epilogue in which the auhtor talks about why he did the book and who he talked with was very interesting.<br /><br />Missisisppians have a bad habit of whining and blaming evrything on others, usually the Yankees.  Clarke is definitely of this school, even referring to the Civil War as the War for Southern Independence, and bemoaning how those poor oppressed Mississippians had to endure all that hardship.  He even states that old discredited theory that the UDC folks love, that the war was really about taxes, conveniently overlooking that annoying slavery issue.<br /><br />Lots of \\"colored people\\" talking in dialect. And for those of you who think the Klan was really a bunch of God fearing only protecting the white folks from the out-of-control darkies, then you will like the book.<br /><br /> This sort of stuff is unfortunate because Clarke clearly has a love for Meridian and spent a lot of effort on the book. It is a shame that he couldn't resist writing like a sterotypical \\" Forget Hell \\"  Mississippian.	2005-07-15

Lewis, the author of several memorable books, has aapparently succummed to the temptation to make a few bucks off his name.  This extremely short book ( I didn't pay enough attention to the details in the Amazon listing )  is also extremely shallow, about his high school coach and the effect that coach had on his life.  The book may have been a passable magazine article somewhere ( Oh, now I read some of the other Customer Reviews, and I see it was a NY Times Mag article ), but it certainly falls way short in the \\"book\\" category.  Interestingly, Lewis writes this rip off book about his coach who constantly preached about not taking the shortcuts, and that the guys would not be rewarded by doing such.  Clearly, Lewis' process of wrting is \\"shortcut\\" book is out of step with the content of the book.  Save your money.	2005-07-12

Bell seems to have been a major player in the Middle East in the 20's during the establishment of Iraq.  She certainly was the only woman on the scene who was a major player.  This situation should have made for a much more interesting book.  Ms Wallach chose to spend way too much time on Ms. Bell's social life, her fashions, her smoking so much, and her rather dismal love life.  The result is a very unsatisfying book.  Ms. Wallach also over and over writes about things that she could not have possibly know, ie \\"she smiled inwardly\\" while upacking her suitcase alone in her room ?????? <br /> <br />Finally, one is left with wondering just how much Ms. Bell actually contributed to the process in Iraq.  The cover mentions her being a colleqgue of T.E. Lawrence, but the book doesn't mention him much.  She did have a lot of meetings though. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm just upset over this whole Iraq thing today which has resulted in great part because of Ms. Bell and her British contemporaries setting up such an artifical state in Iraq in the first palce.

It is extremely well done.  The author travels around the state, interviews many prominent and not-as-prominent Mississippians about problems, solutions, and opportunites for the state to move beyond its history of severe racial problems. <br />In the process he summarizes a lot of history, and introduces many insights about how Mississippi got where it is and what it needs to do to move on.  One thing I, as a white Mississippian with a somewhat liberal bent, found refreshing was his not falling into the trap that many of us Mississippians do of saying that all of that stuff is old news and we have moved beyond it.  Things are undoubtedly better now than before, but while segregation may not be legal it is still very alive in the hearts and minds of the residents, both black and white If books like Walton's cause us to reexamine some of our \\"truths\\" about the state, it will have served an extremely useful purpose. <br /> <br />At any rate, for one wanting to understand more about Mississippi, reading this book is a good way to do it.	2005-03-16

That part of the book was informative for me since I did not know a whole lot about that part of the world and its people.  But, the really intersting part of the book is the parallel story he tells about his mother and father inlaw, who are Holocaust Survivors. <br />That part of the book, which documents his inlaws' survival stories, is especially memorable.  Now the fascinating aspect of all of this to me was that the two stories, ie his memoir, and the inlaws' history, have virtually nothing to do with each other. <br />The two stories remain separate throughout the book. <br /> <br />Offutt's style of short concise sentences, and chapters makes for easy reading.  His insights into the Appalachian culture  <br />are eye opening for us outsiders. <br /> <br />I recommend the book, especially for those who might be considering \\"going home\\" to give back.

In literary circles in Mississippi and elsewhere one need not add a sir name to Willie. Just like Elvis, everybody knows who you are talking about. In addition to being a wunderkind young writer and editor, Morris was widely recognized as an ambassador of sorts for Mississippi.  <br /> <br /> David Halberstam said in his piece, \\" I think we understood in some intuitive way that he was an ambassador for a new Mississippi, one that did not yet exist, but one day surely would-and that in the meantime he was a representative of a pained, troubled society which sent it most talented sons and daughters into momentary exile\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />His book, North Toward Home, is a classic for those Southerners who  left the South, but who have  continuing love/hate feelings about their native region.  I have been a fan of Willie's ever since I first read North Toward Home 30 years ago as an expat Mississippian in Ohio. I enjoyed the book immensely   <br /> <br /> <br />The essays written by  prominent and almost prominent contemporary writers and politicians are wonderfully well written and enjoyable  reads.

However, I loved the book and I am one of the few New Orleanians who doesn't like Confederacy.  I really don't like th4e main chacter,Ignatius. <br /> <br />It is well written and incorporates equal amounts of info on Toole's life and the crosswalks of that like into the book. <br />Toole's mother as she is portrayed in the book is a character not unlike Ignatius, ie you either love her and her perseverance in getting the novel published after Toole's suicide, or you abhor her because of all of her self centered strangeness. <br /> <br />All in all a \\"time well spent\\"  read.	2005-02-11

It is the story of the adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly, a social misfit from Uptown New Orleans, and his interactions  with a bunch of stereotypical New Orleans characters. <br /> <br />This book is one of four books often mentioned as mandatory reading for anyone wanting to understand New Orleans  ( Incidentally, the other three are TN Williams' Streetcar Named Desire, Walker Percy's the Moviegoer, and Kate Chopin's The Awakening).  Many people love Confederacy, and many people, though probably not as many, don't.  After a second reading I confirmed my initial reaction and again firmly place myself in the \\"don't\\" category.  Undoubtedly, the book has some major things going for it ( as do most Pulitizer Prize winning novels ). Toole nails New Orleans cold.  The dialogue is great. <br />One might enjoy the novel if for no other reason than listening to Ignatius' mama and her friend, Santa, pass the time of day in conversation.  His depiction of Uptown New Orleans and the French Quarter are again right on the money.  As someone who lives in the Quarter, I especialy enjoyed his depiction of my neighborhood.  The plot comes together quite well.  But, God, I found  the characters, especially Ignatius, just horrible people without many redeeming social values at all.  And, after two readings with very few chuckles, I just don't get how so many readers think this is not only a laugh out loud novel, but maybe the greatest such novel ever written.  <br /> <br />But what do I know ?  What I do know is that my views are in the minority of New Orleanians. If you are planning to live in New Orleans, you better be familiar with this book, or else you won't be able to get a visa.	2005-02-07

The book chronicles the author's trials with being a Saudi wife. <br />Undoubtedly, Saudi Arabia is a dark world and not somewhere one would want to live.  But, what kind of person would marry into such a world knowing what awaited her.  It was at the point in the book where the author was relating that she had to put on one of those coverall chadors  before exiting the plane on her first arrival into Saudi Arabia that I thought why am I reading about the life of someone who is obviously crazy.  What could possibly cause soemone to do this ?  It had to be that the author was doing it to gain access to the wealth of the Bin Laden family.  Nothing else makes any sense at all.  A little past that point I decided there were too many books written by worthwhile people to justify my spending any more time on this one.  And, additionally, there isn't much to the book anyway that anyone with a passing familiarity with the horrors that are Saudia Arabia wouldn't already know aobut.	2005-02-05

Since I'm one of those Hardy Boys \\"buffs\\" as described in McFarlane's book, I decided to give it a read. I was not disappointed, and I don't think anyone who enjoyed the adventures of the Hardy Boys will be either. McFarlane was  the ghost writer for the first 20 Hardy Boy books. Writing under the familiar to all of us boys pseudonym, F.W. Dixon, McFarlane quickly wrote the stories from outlines provided by Edward Stratemeyer.  Today the Hardy Boys series remains the most popular series of juvenile adventure/detective books ever. <br /> <br />The Ghosts of the Hardy Boys is actually an autobiography of McFarlane and covers more than just his experiences ghosting the Hardy Boys books.  Turns out he did a lot more things, but his main \\"claim to fame\\" was always as the author of the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br />The book isn't very long, and though maybe not as \\"easy a read\\" as the Hardy Boys, it is an easy and enjoyable experience. I defintely recommend it for those  who remember fondly the exploits of the brothers Hardy in Baytown.	2005-01-25

Kurson is an excellent writer who brings that whole strange and exciting world of wreck diving to life.

A sane person might question why one would risk his or her life to recover a dish from a wreck 230 feet deep in the ocean.

Also, though I certaily recognize the courage and \\"stick toitness \\"  of the primary divers, I had to wonder why the obsesiveness over such a mission. <br /> <br />But, to repeat my first statement, this is one great read and well worth the reader's time.	2004-09-08

However, the intricacies of all the puzzles were a bit much and sort of implausable. The characters educating each other during pretty stressful times just didn't ring true. Also, the story depends a lot on happennings that could have just as easily not happenned and sent the story off track.	2003-08-19

This is a wonderful read, especially if you are Southern, or if you have ever wondered just what this fixation Southerners have on the Civil War is all about.  Horowitz combines some Civil War 101 with a travelogue of the South and Civil War battlefields.<BR>In the process he introduces the reader to a whole bunch of memorable characters, and you learn what a Civil Wargasm is.<br />James McPherson author of the Battle Cry of Freedom ( my choice as the best book on the Civil War ) says, &quot; If you want to know why the war isn't over yet in the South, read Confederates in the Attic to find out&quot;  I agree, and would add that Horowitz's style that combines humor with indepth writing makes this one of those books you just don't want to see end.	2003-05-04

And, it has its moments, but not nearly enough to justify your spending time reading it.  McMurtry should be ashamed at writing what is so clearly a shallow book to make a few dollars based on his name.  Reader beware.  You will be disappointed.	2003-03-30

But interesting is an interesting word	I was prepared to not like this book since I had so not liked Winchester's The Map that Changed the World, but I thought this work by the author was a much better effort.  It certainly was an interesting subject, how two very different individuals worked together to help produce the OED.  Those readers into words and their history will love the book.  However, others who are more into plot might find it slow.  I noticed some of the other customer reviewers thought it would have been better as a long article. I agree.  <br />I thought the author at times was stretching to bulk up the story.  But, all in all an enjoyable and memorable read.	2003-03-30

The first book has it moments, and Rubin as an interested outsider does make perceptive observations.  The second book about the crime just never gets going.  It just sort of goes on and on.  It might have been better treated as an article in the Atlantic.<br />I really wanted to like this book more than I did.	2003-03-30

I'm especialy annoyed when the author uses them over and over.  This book is lushly written, but has no central plot. I was left only with a feeling that Newfoundland isn't too nice of a place to live.  I know that I'm out of the mainstream.  I mean, Pulitzer Prize and all.  ( God, now I'm using sentence fragments, too.)<br />This book is for the reader who loves lush descriptions, and who doesn't care much about a story never going anywhere.	2003-02-17

Mr. Levin writes about many of the legends of jazz and recounts  personal experiences with many of the the jazz musicians.  I liked the depth of treatment by the author.  He tells you a lot of interesting things about the musicians and their careers, but doesn't go overboard in telling you more than you really want to know.  His telling of the story of how the statute of Louis Armstrong made it to Louis Armstrong Park in New Orleans is especially informative. I recommend it to most anyone who has an interest in traditional jazz, but especially to those who want ot knwo just a little bit more about the major players.	2003-01-07

The author writes in a popular vein about the explorers in the late 1800's and early 1900's who tried to be the first to the North Pole. Well written. The reader really gets a sense of what it must have been like to be iced into the ice pack, be cold all the time, hunt polar bears, develop scurvy, etc. in the quest for the Pole. The author does a nice job writing about the various players and expeditions. At one point I was sufficiently moved to look up North Pole expeditions on the web with an eye towards gong there. I got over that, but I enjoyed the book till the end.	2003-01-07

Mr. Carter has done an excellent job <BR>describing the origins and growth of Preservation Hall, the citadel of traditional New Orleans jazz at 726 St. Peter St. <BR>He profiles many of the musicians who played at the Hall, and manages to do it in such a way that the reader keeps turning the pages.  I usually run out of steam about the middle of books like this one, but that was not the case with this one.<br />If you enjoy traditional New Orleans jazz, and have ever been to or plan to go to Preseration Hall, you gotta read this book.	2002-11-27

I picked this book up at the library after seeing the Booklist review blurb, &quot; ......carefully constructed psychological thrillers ,.......... &quot;  After 326 pages, I saw absolutely no evidence whatsoever of a thriller of any kind.

I love the way Brian Lamb does his program, Booknotes, on C-Span.  He is at the top of my &quot;people I want to have lunch with&quot; list.  If you, too, enjoy Booknotes and Lamb's interviewing style, then I'm quite sure you will enjoy this book.  If you are not familiar with Booknotes, then you need to get with the program.  You're missing out.<br />Th book is a compilation of summaries of Lamb's interviews with some 130 prominent and not so prominent authors.  Each summary is tightly edited, and written like a statement from the author rather than a Q and A seesion. The result is excellent.  The summaries are short enough to maintain reader interest, and the titles of the authors' books is great fodder for reading lists.<br />If Brian Lamb asked me in his understated manner, &quot; So,what's your recommendation&quot;  My answer would be &quot;  Unqualified 5 stars &quot;	2002-08-02

Maraniss is one fine writer.  The content is excellent.  From  stories about the Packers and their classic games,  stories about a lot of the players, and , of course , many stories about Lombardi himself, the book really flows well.  This is one of those books for me that when it ended after some 540 pages, I was sad.<br />They have an excerpt from a Washington Post review on the cover,<BR>\\"An astonishingly good book...  A trimuph, a classic American biography \\"  I completely agree.<br />Maybe reflecting I'm about the age Lombardi was when he died, I was very taken with the end of the book in which the author wrote  a particularly moving account of Lombardi's last illness and death.<br />There ain't nothing wrong with this book.	2002-05-10

If you are looking to learn what went wrong between the Judeo/ Christian world and the Muslim world, I would recommend that you look at sources other than Dr. Lewis' book.  After  160 pages,<br />the author never does really answer his question in the title.  It may have been this, it may have been that.  Unfortunately, before he gets to this soft conclusion he subjects the reader to a really long trek through Middle Eastern ancient history. Intersstingly, he doesn't say much of anything about World Wat I and the defeat of Turkey.  The author acknowedeges that the book is built around a few lectures he gave. I think thi book is on the Best Sellers list only because of 9/11.  It's an ill wind that doesn't blow someone some good. Two stars at the absolute best.	2002-04-04

Makes you not want to pursue a carreer as a house cleaner, waitress...etc.<BR>I enjoyed (\\"enjoyed\\" may not be the operative  word ) the book, and underlined a lot to use in discussions with some of my more free market oriented friends. I definitely will always leave tips for the housekeepers at hotels, and urge my friends to do likewise.  The author paints a pretty bleak picture of the low income worker's lot in life. I did find the author's tying her experience into her living situations where she tried to make ends meet by leaving in cheap motels kind of a stretch.  She didn't need that aspect to paint the picture she was painting. Finally, I think the book is a good reality check for those  enjoy their upper middle class lifestyles and just cannot seem to sympathize with those who do have the get up and go to achieve a similar life style for themselves.	2002-03-12

I generally enjoyed most of the others, but I  think The Testament was so bad that somebody should have been prosecuted.  I also found the Bretheren lacking.<BR>And, we come to The Summons.  Slow, plodding, takes way too long to tell the story, and when you get to the end, alas there isn't much of a story.  I think Grisham has lost it.  I won't bite on the next one.  The Summons for me was one of those books that made me angry that I had spent time reading it.	2002-03-12

I got the feeling that most of his content  had been well covered by others, but his cutting the pie around the happennings in a single month was creative.  I always enjoy popularly written accounts of Civil War battles, the South in the 1800's , slavery, reconstruction   , etc.  So, I enjoyed the book very much.  Winik doesn't confine all of his writings to the occurrences of April, 1965.  He also uses what was going on then as points of departue for exploring the bios of many of the participating characters, ie Lincoln, Davis, Sherman, Lee, Grant, etc.  These mini-bios were enlightening. He also laces the story with personal items like a six year old Theodore Roosevelt watching Lincoln's funeral procession go by in New York.  <br />I found my interst waning somewhat near the end when the author began addressing what was going on with a lot of other soon to be famous people.  Kind of seemed like he was sruggling to continue the book beyond where it should have logically ended. But, these are minor points.  It is advertised on the cover as a &quot; Civil War Saga&quot;.  Well said.	2002-03-05

Shemp died peacefully in a friend's car after  a horese race.  He just leaned against a friends shoulder and died with a smile on his face.

She could not have read the book and written that.  More appropriate adjectives would  be trite, plodding, poorly written, banal, and disappointing. While the idea for the plot, ie a former priest now a fisherman from the US gets elected Pope, is intriguing, the authors failed miserably to follow up on the promise.  I give it one star only because you apparently have to give it at least that or the system won't accept your review.<br />Save your money.	2002-02-15
