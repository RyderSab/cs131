The purpose of the book is to help cancer survivors to become exceptional patients who learn to embrace life more fully and live longer. Usually these patients are able to take control of their lives and treatments in partnership with their doctors. There is a connection between mind and body which can be exploited in order to maximize chances for recovery. The will to live is very important in this process. In arguably the most interesting chapter of the text, the author describes the characteristics of exceptional patients and other notable survivors. The book provides much information and hope which anyone battling cancer will find uplifting.	2005-06-28

The book is not only Chandler's best novel but also his most ambitious.<br /><br />The character of Roger Wade is very similar to Chandler himself. This is also true of Terry Lenox to a lesser degree. Wade is an alcoholic and Chandler is in top form when he is describing the idiosyncracies of alcoholic behavior.	2005-02-14

The main characters are an exhibition high diver named Dennis Lenahan and a black con artist from Detroit named Robert Taylor. The best part of the book is probably Leonard's description of a reenactment of a Civil War battle. The story's ending is slightly reminiscent of the final scene in the movie CASABLANCA. <br /> <br />TISHOMINGO BLUES appears to be written by formula and it takes a long time to capture the reader's interest. If you are expecting another GLITZ or GET SHORTY, you will be disappointed. But if you just want to relax with a fairly good mystery, TISHOMINGO BLUES may well fill the bill.	2005-01-12

The book is filled with dense material but Funk's readable style helps to make it understandable to the layman.<br />After reading HONEST TO JESUS I am now more convinced than ever that we are indeed beginning to experience a new reformation and the resulting reforms will be driven not by the churches but rather by the publishing industry and the internet.	2003-05-18

One of the more interesting discussions he continues from earlier works is about theism - the idea that there is a personal God somewhere else who intervenes in the affairs of earth in order to accomplish the divine will. He cites Sigmund Freud who believed that theistic religion came about because of the trauma of self-consciousness experienced by the earliest humans. Now there is no work left for a theistic God to perform since the power attributed to this deity can be explained due to scientific advances.<br />Spong's idea of a God who will replace the theistic God is more difficult to understand. The new God is described as a &quot;transcending reality&quot; found in all forms of life but only humans have the capacity to recognize it. Spong seeks this God in his own depths.<br />Spong may seem to be slightly outrageous but he can never be accused of having a closed mind. I always feel energized after reading one of his books - including this one.	2003-04-25

However, these themes are not understandable if we read the Bible literally and the Bible will not survive if it is viewed literally.<br />Spong makes a fairly convincing case against the claim for the Bible's inerrancy. He also gives the reader an upbeat interpretation of the Bible's message. Spong believes that the Bible shows that God loves every person and for Spong the Bible is the means through which he hears and interacts with the Word of God.	2003-04-15

He criticizes mainline Christianity in particular for its outdated explanations of the past and liturgies which are based on canabalistic practices and the blood of sacrifice. He believes fundamentalist Christianity will expire due to its own irrelevance.<br />The new Christianity which follows will emphasize the God-experience exemplified by Jesus. The God Spong envisions will be available through many doorways. We will be able to honor holy lives in all traditions. By holy lives he means those that bring life, love and being to other people. Jesus is Spong's portal to God but God lies beyond Jesus.<br />Spong speaks of a new being which is the dimension of our humanity that escapes the drive to survive and gives itself away to enhance the lives of others. This is selfless love which represents the next state in our evolutionary human development.<br />Spong is a good writer. He is also a provocative thinker and I can't wait for his next book.	2003-01-21

The main character of the novel is a boy named Heathcliff who is an orphan brought to Wuthering Heights by its owner, Mr. Earnshaw. He has two children of his own named Catherine and Hindley. Heathcliff is soon favored over Hindley by Mr. Earnshaw. A bitter rivalry develops between the two boys which is only intensified later by the death of Mr. Earnshaw. Meanwhile Catherine and Heathcliff fall in love and it is this relationship which dominates the book.<br />Catherine and Heathcliff meet the Lintons who own Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is welcomed by the Lintons but Heathcliff is excluded. Heathcliff disappears for three years because of a misunderstanding. During his absence Edgar Linton and Catherine marry. After his return Heathcliff's obsessive love for Catherine and his desire for revenge against Edgar provide all the necessary ingredients for a real tragedy.<br />WUTHERING HEIGHTS can be looked at as a story about love and hate or good and evil. The characters are complicated and interesting. The literary quality of the novel is very high and it is easy to see why Emily is considered by many to be the best writer among the Bronte sisters.	2002-11-26

It is also useful if you are seeking insights into Hemingway. So much of the novel is taken directly from the author's experiences as a foreign correspondent in Spain for the North American Newspaper Alliance.<br />There are many facets of the book which contribute to its outstanding reputation. Hemingway's treatment of Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is exceptional. Jordan is a very complicated man who is radically transformed by the events described in the book. He is also the first Hemingway hero to contemplate suicide.<br />El Sordo is a leader of another guerilla band which is operating in the same territory as the band in which Jordan serves as an aide. The description of El Sordo's last stand on a hill against the Nationalists is an example of Hemingway's best writing.	2002-11-10

The protagonist, however, is named Harry Morgan and as in the film Harry is a fishing boat captain. His wife is named Marie which is the same name as that of the Lauren Bacall character in the movie. The plot of the book is very different and the mood throughout is dark and sombre - except for a few humorous interludes while Harry is drinking in a bar with wealthy tourists.<br />Hemingway begins the story using the first person before switching to the third person after five chapters. The effect of this technique causes some confusion but it does add an extra dimension to both Harry and the plot.<br />As a protagonist Harry is courageous but not very likeable. He at times appears to be just a desparate man who does not mind killing in order to make a decent living for his family.<br />TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT never rises to the level of Hemingway's more successful novels but it is still worth reading as an example of the author's writing during his early years in Cuba.	2002-11-05

Nick also soon meets his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who has made a fortune through questionable means and has moved to Long Island in an attempt to revive an old romance with Daisy.<br />Gatsby knew Daisy before World War I.<br />At Gatsby's suggestion, Nick arranges a reunion between the two former lovers. As the romance is rekindled a tragedy unfolds involving Gatsby, Nick, Daisy, Tom and Tom's mistress as well as her husband.<br />THE GREAT GATSBY is a short book but Fitzgerald manages to create some complicated and interesting characters.

On top of all of this he embarked on a sometimes lonely journey as a scholar which has left him at odds with mainstream academia much of his career.

In two succinct essays and the book's introduction Marcus Borg gives us some basic tenets of modern Jesus scholarship. There is, for instance, no such thing as a wholly objective perspective on Jesus. The Bible is the human product of two ancient societies. The gospels  are products of early Christian communities and they reflect a developing tradition within those groups of people. Jesus' public life took place in the first third of the first century while the canonical gospels were written during the last third of the same century. In between the newly emerging faith was sustained largely by oral tradition. Most of the other contributors to this book are probably in agreement with the above statements even though they come to this discussion from widely different backgrounds.	2002-05-06

It is arranged around interesting topics such as the great compromise of 1790 and the enduring friendship of Adams and Jefferson. Ellis seems to believe that the most underrated person of the generation may be Abigail Adams. As the most overrated character Ellis probably favors Benjamin Franklin. Aaron Burr easily wins the distinction as the most despised member of the brotherhood. I recommend the book as a provocative reading experience, especially if the subject is new to you.	2002-03-02

In Borg's view Jesus has at the center of His life a relationship to the Spirit of God and He is concerned with creating a community grounded in the Spirit. Jesus is a charismatic, a sage, a renewal movement founder and a prophet. Although Borg doubts the authenticity of the exalted identity and purpose of Jesus described in John, he still sees Jesus as a model for the Christian life as well as for one's own personal discipleship.	2002-02-15

In achieving that goal the book is probably a success since Stevenson and Habermas manage to cast doubt on the credibility of the radioactive measurement process.

Borg sees the Christian life as an opportunity to have a deep relationship with God as shown in Jesus Christ. We can use Jesus as a lens through which we see God and what it is like to live a life full of God. Borg's approach is refreshing because it is not necessary to hold a lot of beliefs about Jesus in order to lead such a life.	2001-12-24

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke were then written with the help of those from Mark and another unknown source which is called the Gospel Q. In 1838 a German noticed that there were many sayings of Jesus which were common to Matthew and Luke but not included in Mark. The Lost Gospel Q is comprised of these sayings. Adding fuel to the argument was the discovery in 1945 near the Upper Nile River in Egypt of a codex called the Gospel of Thomas. It contained 114 sayings of Jesus. Over one-third of these sayings were similar to those found in the Lost Gospel Q.<br /> If you accept the idea of the probable existence of Q, then you can look forward to reading sayings of Jesus which were recorded and used by some of His earliest followers less than two decades after His death and resurrection.	2001-12-05

He had a profound religious experience and at some point became associated with John The Baptist. Jesus started his own ministry after John went to prison. The message of Jesus was God-centered and He probably did not think of Himself as the Messiah. Jesus was one of many mediators of the Sacred.<br />Instead of learning and believing certain facts about Jesus, the author views the Christian life to be a journey with the Spirit of Christ towards a deepening and transforming relationship with God. Borg asserts that the gospels were written for Jews and Gentiles in the wider Mediterranean world. They reflect the developing tradition of early Christianity and are not eyewitness accounts.<br />This book will appeal to Christians who are struggling with their faith and looking for a fresh image of Jesus. For those who are firmly rooted in any of the many Christian sects, Borg's book can only promise to be unsettling.	2001-11-27

Manchester has plenty of good material to examine from both the personal and professional aspects of MacArthur's life. MacArthur's genealogical background is also interesting since one of his ancestors is shared in common with both Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.<br />MacArthur is portrayed as a brilliant innovator as exemplified by his masterful manuever in jumping from Hollandia to Leyte in World War II and of course the Inchon landing during the Korean War. The author by necessity tells the story of the U.S. Army's role in the Pacific during World War II mostly from the army's point of view. In that respect AMERICAN CAESAR serves as a useful adjunct to Samuel Eliot Morrison's HISTORY OF UNITED STATES NAVAL OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II.	2001-11-02

Recently I read Volume XII of the HISTORY OF UNITED STATES NAVAL OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II and found it helpful to get an overview by rereading the brief section on the Battle for Leyte Gulf in Costello's book before tackling the four hundred pages on the same subject written by Samuel Eliot Morison in Volume XII. This suggests to me another use for THE PACIFIC WAR 1941-1945 and I intend to continue to use it in this manner in the future.<br />As an attempt to write a one-volume account of World War II in the Pacific I also believe that Costello's book is largely successful.	2001-10-31
