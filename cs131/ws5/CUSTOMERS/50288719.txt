In fact this is probably why they called him 'Doomsday' because they realized they had created a monster who was on the same level as Victor Von Doom.<br /><br />A follow on set of books called 'Superman / Doomsday Hunter Prey' revealed the unimaginable origin of Doomsday.<br /><br />This is pure genius as far as comic books go.<br /><br />I would like to make a movie about this story and I'll play Doomsday.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1563892014 Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001I55O2 Spider-Man - The '67 Collection (6 Volume Animated Set)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001MZ7J6 Jonny Quest - The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OY9V7K Birdman and the Galaxy Trio: The Complete Series]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1563892499 The Flash: Terminal Velocity]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000KCYYKK Silver Surfer Marvel Heroes Long Boarder Mens T-Shirt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1401203655 Green Lantern: Legacy - The Last Will & Testament of Hal Jordan]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004J8FM52 Superman - Doomsday Dust Adult T-Shirt In Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AIEIYTM Doomsday Destruction -- Superman Adult T-Shirt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A5O812A Pastels -- Supergirl -- DC Comics Adult T-Shirt]]	2005-10-09

You can read the entire book in about an hour.<br /><br />The author is wrong in saying in the introduction that Atlantis was not a real place.  Many people are experiencing past life memories now and remembering their experiences on Atlantis.<br /><br />Fascinatingly it indicates that at the beginning the gods divided up the earth and Poseidon took what was to become Atlantis.  Poseidon created Atlantis and another name for Atlantis is Poseidia.<br /><br />Poseidon's first born son was Atlas who the Atlantic ocean was named after.  Sadly Atlas was turned into a mountain of stone by the witch Medussa if I remember my mythology correctly.<br /><br />The temple of Poseideon was beautiful but yet had a 'strange, barbaric appearance'.<br /><br />Fascinatingly Plato abruptly ends his writings at precicely the point where Zeus and the other gods have convened to talk about destroying Atlantis (and I think some other places).<br /><br />Why did Plato do this ?  Was he perhaps afraid of misquoting 'the god of gods' ?<br /><br />Sadly we may never know.<br /><br />But most likely it was only through the intervention of the gods that Athens could have defeated Atlantis.  I think the Atlanteans had nuclear weapons and other strange military technologies.<br /><br />I suspect that Plato was in fact the reincarnation of Poseidon.<br /><br />As Plato's student Aristotle said of Atlantis:<br /><br />\\"He who invented it also destroyed it.\\"<br /><br />Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:156718023X Atlantis: Insights from a Lost Civilization]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]	2005-09-06

That's what happened to me with this book.<br /><br />Just by reading this one book you can get caught up on the entire new age movement.  It touches on many of the main new age ideas.<br /><br />It also offers a possible theory for the origin of our human race including the time when our dna was converted from a single strand to two strands which contain the memories of both the original earth people and the star people.<br /><br />These crystal skulls, especially the original 13 that were given to humanity by beings from other planets, are exquisite and priceless works of art.  But they are much more.  When they have been brought back together they will become an amazing 'living library' of ancient and arcane knowledge.<br /><br />These skulls can truly be called sacred objects.  It is not often that a physical object can be said to possess supernatural properties.<br /><br />The big question is what is going to happen on 12/21/12 when this current age ends.<br /><br />Will we enter a new age of peace and wonderous knowledge ?<br /><br />Or will our human race simply die out as a result of pollution, greed, and violence ?

It's like I can feel Atlantis calling to me from across the centuries.<br /><br />The writing style is very unusual.  It contains many profound statements about Jesus Christ, the meaning of life, good and evil, etc.<br /><br />To me the best parts were the descriptions of life on Atlantis.  These include not only the advanced technology but also the underlying spiritual principles, social structure, criminal justice system, etc..  This information is presented in the form of a first person narrative meaning the author claims to have actually lived on Atlantis in a previous life.<br /><br />We can call it 'technology' but it was more a knowledge of the fundamental forces of nature.  Eventually the high priests in  Atlantis (not everyone else) found they didn't need physical air planes and things like this to travel.  They could project their bodies to other places.  This was just the result of a more advanced understanding of those same mysterious 'night forces'.<br /><br />Whether or not I actually believe everything stated in this book I would say no.  I don't see how anyone could be living on the planet Venus in physical form.  We know now that Venus is an uninhabitable, volcanic wasteland.  If anyone is living there it's not in the physical form that we are familiar with.<br /><br />However I do believe in Atlantis and the information presented here is consistent with the statements made by the American psychic Edgar Cayce who I do believe in.<br /><br />I would say the author had a lot of knowledge about Atlantis and other arcane subjects and was some type of mystic or supernatural being.<br /><br />Either that or he had done a lot of research in these areas and then constructed a very elaborate and detailed fictional story for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In any case the story is consistent throughout and doesn't contradict itself.  It all seems to make sense as far as how the sequence of events are described.<br /><br />My own conclusion is this book contains real events and facts about Atlantis which are then embellished to create an interesting fictional story.<br /><br />Or possibly the author himself really believes it but he himself was deceived by some weird spirit guides.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]w the sequence of events are described.

This is a well researched and fascinating book.<br /><br />The author has an almost childlike faith and trust in her belief in Atlantis.  There is no question in her mind whatsoever that Atlantis was a real place.  This is because she had been on Atlantis as a young girl during the final destruction.<br /><br />Quite a few references are made to visitations and influences by extraterrestrial beings.  She also mentions the mysterious Philadelphia Experiment and The Montauk Project when people in the 1900s were supposedly involved with time travel and other secret knowledge.  These strange high tech projects are somehow tied in with satanism and the black arts although I don't know how.<br /><br />Amazingly Shirley indicates that there were still some plesiosaurs around during the Atlantean times:<br /><br />\\"Plesiosaurus often came to the surface just to play with and upset the flimsy crafts of the fisherman, sending the occupants into the water, where they made a delicious meal.\\"<br /><br />The appendix contains great refererences to other authors including the philosopher Plato.  Plato's father indicated he was a direct descendant of Poseidon.  Who knows maybe Plato was a reincarnation of Poseidon.<br /><br />I see what I have to do now.

Either that or he already wrote a book about the Mayan calendar and ran out of material but decided to write another book anyway.<br /><br />Conveniently his theories match up with things like the big bang occurred 16 billion years ago.

The author herself as well as another reviewer who is discussed in the book had lived on Atlantis and were there when it sank for the final time I think.<br /><br />I picture Atlantis as a paradise with beautiful women with flowing blond hair dressed in beautuful robes standing around the amazing crystal in the temple.  Somebody should make a movie about this.<br /><br />As I read this book I got a feeling that I may have been the philosopher Plato in a past life.  However I'm not sure about this.<br /><br />Like Plato I'm fascinated with this subject.  Also Plato did something that I think was very important.  He preserved the info about Atlantis by travelling to the library at Alexandria.  This library was tragically later burned.<br /><br />I don't necessarily agree that the visions of Ezekiel in the bible were flying saucers.  I have witnessed similar phenomenon.<br /><br />I once saw three miniature orange suns hovering above the forest.  These suns starting moving together as a beautiful dome of light appeared above them that contained all the colors of the spectrum.  Lightning flashing.  Smoke on the ground.

A truly super race.  This may have been the garden of Eden described in the bible.<br /><br />But in 'The Destruction Of Atlantis' Frank starts diverging into many different interpretations of a series of geological and astonomical catastrophes that oblitered much of the human race 3200 years ago according to him.  The bible describes this catastrophe as the great flood but could that possibly have been just 3200 years ago ? There are many other similar myths that Frank ties together to try to indicate that they are all describing the same catastrophe (which they may be in some cases).<br /><br />However he contradicts Plato on a key point and he even admits this in the book.  Plato insisted that the destruction of Atlantis occurred 11,600 years ago.  But Frank says that when the Egyptians translated Plato's writings they accidentally converted Plato's numbers from months to years so the 11,600 number is much too high.<br /><br />However that's quite an assumption to make.  If you're going to say that you could question every date that's ever been recorded in history.  Could the Egyptians really have been so stupid ?<br /><br />This is just one example of how he takes existing information and makes it fit into his theories.<br /><br />Then finally on the last few pages Frank starts suggesting that Atlantis may have really been the super race that new agers believe in.  It's like he's torn between the new age movement and his desire to fit in with the conventional scientific community which in other places he says he despises.<br /><br />A lot of these answers were probably contained in one of the many libraries that have been burned and destroyed throughout recorded history by people of many different religions.  At one point the book lists all of these centers of recorded information that were destroyed.  At the end of the list is the library at Alexandria.<br /><br />At least Frank survived long enough to write this book.

Particularly interesting to me was the stories of people who travelled mentally to Atlantis and ancient Egypt and also to the future on this planet:<br /><br />on Atlantis the buildings were made of something like glass and people used their knowledge of the forces of nature for evil purposes.  the guy who did this got the 'rack' treatment by the Catholic church in a later lifetime.<br /><br />the priests in ancient Egypt used 'energy rods' that produced sound and light energy to heal the body.  using these secret arcane methods they could stimulate the body to regenerate limbs that were lost in battle.  this guy is a homosexual in his present life. his partner makes him do things he doesn't like.  sexual things.<br /><br />These ideas are consistent with the Edgar Cayce material.  The markings inside the great pyramid tell the history of our human race which I think ends around the year 3200 according to the pyramid.  Interestingly none of Dr. Weiss' case studies in this book spoke of any time on earth past the year 3200 although they spoke of coming to this planet some 60,000 years ago and hiding some artifacts from their civilization.<br /><br />Dr. Weiss also summarizes his prophetic vision of the future based on his progessing of groups of people at his seminars.<br /><br />I would love to have Dr. Weiss hypnotize me and talk with him for many hours and then have him write a book about my experiences.<br /><br />I'm signed up to attend his weekend session coming up in Rhinbeck, NY in August 2005.  I didn't get into the following week long session but will keep checking his schedule:<br /><br />I only believe in Dr. Weiss not other people like psychics who claim they can communicate with the dead.  Those people use their psychic powers for their own greed probably.  I'm one of those people that Dr. Weiss mentions that have some fears that this subject has the potential to lead into the black arts and the occult.

The grave robbers stole most of the material treasures from the kings' tombs but much greater treasure has yet to be discovered.  Nobody has disturbed it because the sphinx was set as a sentinel to protect it all these thousands of years.<br /><br />This amazing theory (which I believe) was that the Giza plateau was designed based on a time scale of thousands of years and the monuments reflect the position of the stars and constellations over this time period.  Who built the great pyramid and the other monuments ?  Not aliens as many believe but gods.  Even the Christ spirit was there in the form of Hermes.<br /><br />The number 12 comes up a lot in this book.  Twelve is a very mysterious number.  According to the book 'UFO Contact From Planet Iarga' there are twelve universes.  The Iargans showed a sort of machine which has been created on another planet which represents the twelve universes.  It's a machine that just keeps running forever.<br /><br />This is consistent with the idea that the complex under the Giza plateau mirrors the creation of the universe(s).<br /><br />As recently as the early 1900s people have witnessed monks in Tibet both levitating and disintegrating gigantic stones using musical instruments including a strange 'gong'.<br /><br />Einstein said that 'imagination is more important than information'.  I agree with the author that a lot of the people controlling the Giza plateau are suffering from a severe lack of imagination.  Rather than realize that the great pyramid is a machine (read 'The Giza Power Plant' by Christopher Dunn) they keep drilling holes and damaging the pyramid even more than it already has been.<br /><br />A lack of imagination can have terrible consequences. The conclusion of the 9/11 commission was that 9/11 was caused by a failure of imagination.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425093204 Edgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of man]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1585422509 The Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]usion of the 9/11 commission was that 9/11 was caused by a failure of imagination.

Maybe there really was for example a 'medussa' who had snakes of living hair.<br /><br />Very interesting for me was the idea that Polaris, the North Star, has become lined up with the entrance to The Great Pyramid in 2004.  This alignment indicates that our human race is approaching the beginning of a new age or a new 'root race', the fifth root race.  This is tied in with the Mayan calendar that indicates that the current age started arouond 3100 BC and will end in December 2012.<br /><br />The book also contains a chapter about the various apparitions of the Mother Of God at Fatima and other places.  Interestingly the Cayce material related to Mary has its parallels in Catholic tradition.  Cayce indicated that Mary is the twin soul of the Christ spirit and was created from Adam as is indicated in the bible.  It can be interesting to see how the Catholic Church has its own interpretation of these ideas.<br /><br />The book also talks about the time when the apostles spoke in one language but everyone could understand them.  This may not have been a verbal language but instead is a type of radiation that even the plants and animals can understand.  Our ability to understand the radiation was lost as is indicated in the Tower Of Babel story in the bible.<br /><br />Surprisingly the authors feel that Edgar Cayce's statement that the Great Pyramid is 10,500 years old is wrong based on carbon dating of material from the pyramid.  But I don't think Edgar Cayce was ever wrong.  Sometimes for example he said things would happen in '98 and people thought he meant 1998 but he could just have easily meant 2098 or even 3198.<br /><br />I think what may be happening there is the radiation from the Great Pyramid nuclear reactions messed up the carbon dating.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />(which I donated to the ARE library and which mentions Edgar Cayce)<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1585422509 The Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]eff Marzano    [[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]    [[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]    (which I donated to the ARE library and which mentions Edgar Cayce)    [[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]    [[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]    [[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]    [[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]    [[ASIN:1585422509 The Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)]]    [[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]    [[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]    [[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]	2004-09-08

For me it was impossible to understand what he was talking about with all the numerology.<br /><br />A lot of the Mayan art work contains monstrous creatures who are always frowning and looking sad. That's probably a warning about the possible dangers of getting involved with the I Ching.  At the beginning of the book it states that some Jesuit monks had experimented with the I Ching and they went insane.  (The I Ching appears in the tv show 'Dark Shadows' as a way to open doors to other domains.)<br /><br />I wasn't able to read the last chapter because I started to sense the horrible occult energy coming from the book.  Then I heard a voice say 'we are the keepers of the light'.  I can't imagine who was telling me this.<br /><br />This often happens when I read books which are based on occult or satanic ideas such as for example The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />On the positive side there are some beautiful illustrations that I think the author created himself.  The author is certainly an unusual person who has a background in art history.  Another reviewer said the author thinks he's a reincarnation of one of the Lords Of Time.  Certainly anyone with such an intense interest in Mayan history must have had past life experiences as a Mayan.

Interestingly Cacye indicated there are three identical sets of records which are all the same and are somehow really part of the same thing.  This seems to parallel the idea of The Holy Trinity.<br /><br />In this case the focus is on the lost hall down in the Yucatan.  The other sites are at the Giza plateau in Egypt and Bimini near the Bahamas where Atlantis sank.<br /><br />The conclusion as I understand it is some of the artifacts related to the lost hall may have already been discovered and they are in various museums but people don't realize what they are.  Cayce indicated that back in the 1930s people had actually discovered some stones that had strange powers but they 'know so little about them'.<br /><br />But the actual lost hall hasn't been discovered yet and nobody is really sure where it is exactly.<br /><br />Van Auken believes he had lived in ancient Egypt in a past life and was some type of priest.  He was in the great pyramid and was levitated off the ground and into the mysterious fire inside the pyramid.<br /><br />A lot of the material in this book diverges from the search for the lost hall and gets into a discussion of Edgar Cayce's prophecies about the akashic record.  The akashic record is the 'book' that contains the history of every souls activities in this earthly plain.  Cayce was able to read from this psychic book.<br /><br />The authors have another book out which expands on the akashic record and other things called 'Secrets Of The Ancient World'.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:087604481X Secrets of the Ancient World: Exploring the Insights of America's Most Well-Documented Psychic, Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]cumented Psychic, Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]	2004-09-08

I ordered it after seeing the authors on tv several times where they were interviewing serial killers and talking about profiling.  I believe one of them actually invented the entire idea of profiling and he used his profiling techniques to catch that 'Gacy the clown' guy who buried 30 kids in his basement.<br /><br />This book is very informative and gives insights into the minds of the homicidal psychopaths. It's interesting to see how looking at a crime scene tells so much about the offender.  It's like the killers are expressing their horrible natures in symbolic, ritualistic ways.<br /><br />If I understand the authors' conclusions correctly sexual psychopaths gets completely consumed by their horrible fantasies to the point where they become more or less disfunctional.  (That's assuming they ever were functional.)  In their fantasy world the killer has complete control and domination over everyone else which is what they crave.  At some point they start to project these dark fantasies into the real world.<br /><br />There's also an interesting section about the affects of a murder on the families.  Not surprisingly these affects are all negative and can be severe:<br /><br />&#34;I can't have sex with my husband anymore because every time he touches me, I think about what the rapist did to her.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I hate Halloween.  My sons body was found in a desert area badly decomposed, a week after he was murdered.  Each year when I see the skeletons at Halloween, they remind me of my son and what he must have looked like.&#34;<br /><br />In another case the father lost his job (without pension) because he couldn't concentrate anymore and the mother was also out on sick leave from her job.<br /><br />There's also a section on how a female should possibly react if confonted by a potentially violent psychopath.Sexual assault is horrible in its own unique way I guess.<br /><br />I may read some more books about this subject.  I would like to find more case studies of what the psychopath did and how the profilers figured out who the killer was based on the evidence.<br /><br />I think subjects related to forensic science are getting very popular nowadays.  There's a lot of tv shows coming out which are based on some of the non fiction shows like 'Cold Case Files' and 'Forensic Files'.like to find more case studies of what the psychopath did and how the profilers figured out who the killer was based on the evidence.

It was originally distributed internally within IBM and many changes were made based on feedback from the original users.<br />This is a good example of how someone managed a tremendous amount of information.<br />The reference documentation was written before the language was actually implemented.  The author felt that writing the reference documentation after the language was implemented would result in inaccurate documentation because the writer would know the implementation too well to write an objective description.<br />He says the following about the thousands of e-mails he received from the original users:<br />&quot;All of this mail was reviewed some time after the initial correspondence in an effort to perceive trends and generalities that might not have been apparent on a day-to-day basis.&quot;<br />I guess this is similar to how things evolve in the unix world.<br />Something gets introduced on some newsgroup and then it evolves.<br />Anyway the end result is a relatively easy-to-understand programming language which fills a certain type of niche functionality very well.<br />Rexx is sort of like a scripting or command language but it has many of the same features as a full blown programming language plus some of its own unique features.<br />It's definitely a better alternative than batch files for working with files and issuing commands to the operating system.	2003-07-04

Also the accuracy of the psychic info is examined.<br /><br />The general conclusion as I understand it is that Cayce had little interest in reading about esoteric subjects in his normal (non trance) life.  In any case he wasn't that much of an intellectual.  So there is very little verifiable evidence that the psychic info was influenced by existing sources to any significant degree.<br /><br />The psychic info about things like Atlantis and past or future events is presented as being less than completely accurate and reliable.  However I disagree with this.<br /><br />Problem: Cayce said earth changes and other historical events would occur in 1958 and 1998 such as New York City would sink under the ocean.<br /><br />Answer:  He didn't say '1958' and '1998'.  He said '58 and '98.  This could mean any years such as 2058, 3198, etc.  (Other supporters of Cayce have said that he was correct but people changed so the future events didn't occur.  However this is not an accurate description of a prophet.  Prophets only say things that happen.  Anyone can say something 'might' happen.)<br /><br />Those 20 years cycles come up in relation to the time travel experiments that were performed by the navy during The Philadelphia Experiement which later became The Montauk Project.<br />The earth is on some type of 20 year cycle.<br /><br />Problem: It is highly unlikely that such a high percentage of those who received psychic readings would have personally known Cayce and Jesus Christ in past lives.<br /><br />Answer: It was Cayce's hope and prayer to help people understand themselves and their relationship to God in his own unique way.  God answered his prayer and sent those people into his life to help him accomplish his goal.  (Cayce said he wrote the gospel of Luke in a past life.)<br /><br />Problem:  If a highly advanced civilization such as Atlantis existed we would have some evidence of their advanced technology.<br /><br />Answer: Such evidence does exist.  It's called 'the great pyramid'.  In his book The Giza Power Plant Christopher Dunn proves that the great pyramid was a machine like a form of nuclear reactor.  The gigantic granite blocks inside the pyramid contain crystals which transformed energy to generate a cosmic energy beam.  This is eerily similar to Cayce's description of the temple in Atlantis with its crystal technology and death ray.<br /><br />Any other discrepancies found in the Cayce readings can be attributed to misunderstandings which occurred when the information was recorded or to misinterpretation.<br /><br />I think I have demonstrated that everything Cayce said while he was in the trance state is true.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1585423157 The Essential Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876043503 The Lives of Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743264347 Same Soul, Many Bodies: Discover the Healing Power of Future Lives through Progression Therapy]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TBYA06 The Truth About The Philadelphia Experiment]]n such as Atlantis existed we would have some evidence of their advanced technology.

This is called the law of kharma.<br /><br />I doubt if there's any other source of information available that can provide this type of insight into the process of reincarnation.  For most of us this type of information remains mainly at the subconscious level while we travel through our earthly lives.<br /><br />This is one of Edgar Cayce's greatest legacies.<br /><br />There's also a tremendous amount of other information besides Cayce's experiences in this earthly realm.  Cayce interacted with incarnations of the Christ spirit in some of his past lives as well as with Abraham in the bible and other famous historical figures.<br /><br />The sceptic will find it hard to believe that one person would have had experiences involving so many significant historical events and so many historical figures.  However the reason for this is that Cayce himself is an historical figure and he is a very spiritually oriented person.  Often when people like this are reincarnated they reach a level of fame and recognition and they share experiences with similar types of souls.<br /><br />Not all of Cayce's past life experiences were positive by the way.  He was the one who got tricked into letting the Greeks bring the Trojan horse into Troy and then he committed suicide.  He hit rock bottom during his two incarnations as the soldier of fortune John Bainbridge, going so far as to use his psychic powers to make money gambling.<br /><br />At times the Edgar Cayce soul entity had problems in two areas which are problematic for many people; sexuality and a feeling of racial superiority.  As the law of kharma says must happen  he experienced the negative effects of these things himself in the most heart breaking and brutal ways.  Unfortunately the mistakes we make often affect not only ourselves but those we are closest to.<br /><br />The author indicates that Cayce gave specific dates for the second coming of Christ and Cayce's next incarnation.  The year for both of these events is given as 1998.<br /><br />Since this year has already passed the questions are:<br /><br />1) have these things happened but we don't realize it yet ?<br /><br />2) did Cayce really say '98 (as he sometimes did) and mean for example some other year ending in '98' such as 2098 or even 3098 ? (this seems doubtful because the author is an expert on the Cayce readings.)<br /><br />3) did Cayce really mean 1998 but some other misunderstandings occurred when the readings were recorded or interpreted ?<br /><br />4) was Cayce wrong about the year for these events ?  since he was right very often this is an interersting question.<br /><br />I don't know the answers to these questions.  I did order a book entitled 'Edgar Cayce In Context' which may help with putting Cayce's psychic prophecies into perspective.

The author indicates that Cayce gave specific dates for the second coming of Christ and Cayce's next incarnation.  The year for both of these events is given as 1998.    Since this year has already passed the questions are:    1) have these things happened but we don't realize it yet ?    2) did Cayce really say '98 (as he sometimes did) and mean for example some other year ending in '98' such as 2098 or even 3098 ? (this seems doubtful because the author is an expert on the Cayce readings.)    3) did Cayce really mean 1998 but some other misunderstandings occurred when the readings were recorded or interpreted ?    4) was Cayce wrong about the year for these events ?  since he was right very often this is an interersting question.    I don't know the answers to these questions.  I did order a book entitled 'Edgar Cayce In Context' which may help with putting Cayce's psychic prophecies into perspective.  I haven't received or read this book yet.

I read it quite a few years ago before the Internet even existed in its present form.<br /><br />It's not like other UFO related books that talk about things like alien abductions which are performed by the evil aliens.  In fact the Iargans indicate that these evil aliens' flying saucers sometimes crash such as the Roswell crash and the alien autopsy video.<br /><br />This book talks about things like Jesus Christ, the bible, the anti-Christ, injustice on our planet, the buildup of nuclear arsenals, etc., and how these same events and patterns of behavior occur on many other planets.<br /><br />The Iargans talk about their planet also.  They are much more socialistic and advanced than Earth but they do have to deal with many of the same issues and problems.<br /><br />The Iargans mention Edgar Cayce and Atlantis.<br /><br />I searched through quite a few UFO books and other far out info.  This book is by far the most valuable UFO related book I've ever read.<br /><br />The Iargans indicate that some changes are going to occur on our planet as they do on many other planets.  The time for these changes are probably approaching soon although I don't know what form these events will take.<br /><br />They said 'Satan is going to collect all of the selfishness he's given out'.<br /><br />Yes, I suspect Satan is going to be taking care of some business soon.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002J09 Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671797204 Secret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1585423157 The Essential Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1931044899 Crash at Corona: The U.S. Military Retrieval and Cover-Up of a UFO]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1569243425 Top Secret/Majic: Operation Majestic-12 and the United States Government's UFO Cover-up]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004HWQJ8E Secrets of the Unified Field: The Philadelphia Experiment, The Nazi Bell, and the Discarded Theory by Joseph P.

I don't understand why some other reviewers said that this book somehow corrects what Edgar Cayce said.  To me it is in complete agreement with what Cayce said, even to the point of devoting an entire chapter to people who were identified in the Cayce readings as having lived in Atlantis.  They had names like 'Aa-rr-ll-uu' and 'Sululon'.<br /><br />Scientific evidence does not exist to prove things like the Atlanteans' crystal technology, their ability to travel through time and space, etc..  Since the author is a researcher he doesn't claim that scientific evidence exists where none does exist.  But I don't see where he tries to disprove these fantastic but possibly true theories either.<br /><br />This book discusses the Atlantis that Plato spoke of but by then Atlantis was much like the other races that existed around 1200 BC.  This was a much different Atlantis than the one Cayce spoke of with its crystal technology, death rays, genetically engineered 'things', etc..  The islands of Atlantis sank over a period of thousands of years, not all at once if I understand the legends correctly.<br /><br />I believe that proof of Atlantean technology does exist.  It's been sitting on the Giza plateau for thousands of years.  It's called 'the great pyramid'.  In his book The Giza Power Plant Christopher Dunn proves that the great pyramid was a form of nuclear reactor.  Dunn's book proves that the great pyramid was built by people who had god like powers and knowledge of time and space.  It was Edgar Cayce in another incarnation as the high priest Ra Ta who built the great pyramid.  The sacred geometry for building the great pyramid was given to Ra Ta by another god like being named Horus.<br /><br />This idea is consistent with 'Edgar Cayce's Atlantis And Lemuria'.  This book indicates that these god like beings from Atlantis and Lemuria became the mythical gods of later races such as the Incas and Myans.  Those later races talk of 'gods' who came from the sea and taught them about new technologies, astronomy, etc..  Eventually most of this knowledge was lost as these civilizations de-volved to the point of like the Incas began the practice of human sacrifice.<br /><br />There's a big part of the Atlantis story that's still enshrouded in mystery.  All we have is a few statements from Cayce's psychic readings and a few archeological sites under water.  You get glimpses of these mysterious topics when in the Cayce readings it refers to things like 'visitations of those from the outer spheres'.  This would seem to imply that Atlantis was being visited by beings from other planets, other dimensions, etc..<br /><br />This book offers a comparison between what happened to Atlantis  and our modern world.  Atlantis was destroyed by the greed of individuals.  For them this was catastrophic because their greed could be transformed into energy by the terrible crystals.<br /><br />The final paragraph of this book is:<br /><br />\\"Everyone senses a crossroads just ahead.  When we reach it, which example will we follow - Lemuria or Atlantis.\\"<br /><br />I would answer with a quote from a book called 'UFO Contact From Planet Iarga' which was supposedly communicated to someone by people from another planet called Iarga.  The Iargans stated:<br /><br />\\"The human race lives for the present since it really has no future.\\"<br /><br />The Iargans may mean that our human race doesn't have a long term future.  Even if we last for another thousand years that's a relatively short time in relation to the universe.<br /><br />I think most people would agree that many industries have a relatively short term view of using the earth's resources.  Maybe somehow everyone knows that what the Iargans said is true.<br /><br />The Iargans also said that sometimes when people see flying saucers those are our ancestors from Atlantis travelling through time to see us.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]repretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]    [[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]    [[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]    [[ASIN:0876045123 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis]]    [[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]    [[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]    [[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]	2003-05-19

If you're convinced that the great pyramid was built by a bunch of guys pulling 50 ton blocks of granite around in the desert with ropes you probably won't like this book.<br /><br />You can read this book in one night as I did.  Quite a few pages are taken up by beautiful pictures of art work from Egypt with explanations of the hidden meaning of the symbols and figures.  If there was ever a race of people who were heavily into symbolism it was the Egyptians.<br /><br />This book makes some statements which have implications that apply to the entire human race.  One is that the current form of the human body is going to change somehow sometime in the near future.  This has only happened a few times since the beginning of the human race.<br /><br />I didn't realize that the high priest Ra Ta who built the great pyramid was a reincarnation of Edgar Cayce.  I think it's obvious that Cayce is a very unusual soul.  If I understand correctly it says Cayce was going to be reincarnated again in 1998 which means he may already be alive again.<br /><br />Another suprise for me is there are many similarities between the ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and other religions such as Christianity and the Jewish faith.  It's possible that Mary the mother of Christ and the godess Isis are the same person.  For Catholics Mary is like a godess anyway and this may be an accurate symbol since she is supposedly also Eve who was created by dividing the soul of Adam (Christ).  So she is the twin soul of God.<br /><br />I have no problems believing all of the references to Atlantis.  To me what Cayce says makes perfect sense.<br /><br />For more wonderful ideas about the construction of the great pyramid I recommend this book:<br /><br />The Giza Power Plant by Christoper Dunn<br /><br />Dunn proves that the great pyramid was actually a machine like a form of nuclear reactor that shot a cosmic energy beam into outer space.  Dunn's theories agree with this book that the great pyramid was built using anti gravity technology.<br /><br />I believe what Cayce said that we are entering a new age.<br /><br />The Egyptians indicated this also and said that some type of trial by fire is going to occur.  Yes, I believe this.  I believe Satan is going to collect all of the selfishness he has given out.<br /><br />A lot of this information is consistent with theories I read in a book that was supposedly communicated to someone by people from another planet called Iarga.  They said that human beings could originally communicate using a non verbal form of radiation that even the plants and animals can understand (ie. 'everyone spoke the same language').  The Tower Of Babel story in the bible indicates the point that humans lost the ability to understand the radiation.  People such as Tanya Fitzpatrick (the Pet Psychic) can still understand the radiation.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001DMXJC Meditation Music of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]hat shot a cosmic energy beam into outer space.

However it appears to me that this book provides a good sampling of many different books that never made it into the bible (for good reasons though).  These samplings are short enough so as not to dwell too long on any one subject which could become boring if you're not really interested in a particular area too much.<br /><br />I felt the views expressed in the introductions were not biased towards any specific belief system and were almost scientfic.<br /><br />Those who don't believe in for example the Gnostic philosophy will probably wonder (as I did) how such an elaborate belief system and philsophy could be created if it wasn't inspired by some god or other.  You really have to wonder why people would come up with something like this.<br /><br />The Raelian organization which wants to start cloning human beings follows some of these Gnostic ideas I believe.<br /><br />Some of these books were apparently written to entertain people like religious versions of Aesop's fables.  However to me the events surrounding the life and death of Christ and His apostles don't lend themselves very well to entertainment purposes.<br /><br />The main reason I read this book was to pick up some ideas that might be true but which are not in the bible.  I did find some of these items.  For example a physical description is provided of Abraham's wife Sarah (she was one of the most beautiful women who ever lived) and it tells that Abraham knew the evil pharoah would want to kill Abraham and kidnap Sarah.<br /><br />In another place it says Abraham went into Egypt to confront the occult forces and the prophet Isaiah was sawed in half. There's a few good items about Moses also.<br /><br />But these possibly true ideas are few and far between.  Most of this book is about things that the Christian and Jewish person will not believe.  Many of these alternative philosophies are in direct contradiction to Jewish and Christian beliefs.<br /><br />For those who are familiar with the Christian gospels some of these alternate gospels which claim to quote Christ can actually be humorous because they don't sound quite the way you expect them to:<br /><br />Jesus said, \\"Blessed is he who came into being before he came into being.\\"<br /><br />Jesus said, \\"Whoever has come to understand the world has found a corpse, and whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world.\\"<br /><br />They showed Jesus a gold coin and said to Him, \\"Caesar's men demand taxes from us.

It also contains references to many other books which sound excellent for people who are interested in Egyptology.<br /><br />I'm planning on going back and ordering a bunch of the books which are referenced in 'Giza The Truth'.<br /><br />I felt the first chapters spent too much time talking about things which really cannot be proven in any way. A new age theory would be presented and then refuted using traditional beliefs about Egyptology which to me are no more reliable than the new age ideas. I think it's obvious now that traditional beliefs about the Giza plateau are severely lacking in credibility and don't stand up to close scrutiny.<br /><br />I felt this book suffers from some ambiguity about whether or not to believe the more far out new age type of ideas relating to the original building of the great pyramid and the Giza plateau.<br /><br />For example the book states that the following things are possible:<br /><br />1)the ancient Egyptians may have been given secret knowledge<br /> from beings from outer space<br /><br />2)the ancient Egyptians may have had an anti gravity capability<br /><br />But then it sometimes disagrees with other new age theories relating to the building of the great pyramid such as those presented by Christopher Dunn in 'The Giza Power Plant'.<br /><br />If the above 2 statements are true that makes many of the other new age ideas much more possible such as Dunn's theory that the great pyramid was like a form of nuclear reactor.<br /><br />Another new age theory is that the pathways inside the great pyramid tell the entire history and future of the human race with every inch representing about one year.<br /><br />I suspect the authors have been so thoroughly involved in traditional Egyptology that they find it hard to accept that the great pyramid was apparently built by beings who had god like powers.

I personally believe a lot of it is true or at least it's a true interpretation of events as the author perceived them.<br /><br />Mr. Nichols is an engineer and a real person who got pulled into some of these top secret government projects.  He indicates that this involvement did not occur by chance but was his destiny because of his relationship with beings that live on planets in the Pleiades constellation of stars.<br /><br />The world is lucky that guys like Mr. Nichols and Al Bielek even have a brain left.  Anyone involved in projects like this eventualy gets the old 'debriefing' treatment.  I think Dunkin Cameron is legally brain dead.<br /><br />Mr. Nichols describes an apparent attempt on his life which required major surgery when a government agent knocked him out with a stun gun while he was driving.  He 'got too close' to knowing the truth about their intentions to use the Star Wars system as a mind control vehicle against the entire human race.<br /><br />Therein lies the frightening aspect of this entire subject in general.  It appears that there are top secret projects going on and that human life is expendible if someone becomes a threat to whatever the goals of the project are.  Making it even more frightening is that some of the people that are driving these projects may have connections to beings from other planets whose intentions appear to be malevolent towards the human race.<br /><br />I think most people believe in God, Satan, angels, etc., or at least some form of beings that are above the human which are either good or bad.  This book sort of stays consistent with this idea but these beings are portrayed as coming from other planets in some cases.  There does appear to be a relationship between what this book says and traditional beliefs about evil beings such as the followers of the Leviathon possibly coming from a certain area of the galaxy.<br /><br />This only makes what to me is a very frightening idea even more frightening.<br /><br />The second part of this book is by Peter Moon who tells how the Pleiades constellation fits into mythology and other ancient legends about the human race.  I tend to agree that those mythological stories hold hidden meanings that have a basis in reality at some level.  They are probably symbolicly written stories that indicate spiritual truths and real events similar to the Adam and Eve story.<br /><br />Moon gets into a large amount of other philosophy such as tying this stuff in with the bible and other things.  He has a background in scientology and other strange philosophies.<br /><br />The art work on the cover of this book and the other one I've read so far is excellent.  I like the horse on 'The Montauk Project'.  This is a depiction of the mysterious horse the Montauk boys saw when they were sent to the year 6037 AD.  If you turn the horse upside down it forms another picture.  Moon expands on the possible meaning of this horse.<br /><br />On page 88 Mr. Nichols offers a possible explanation for the large bulge that could be observed in Von Neumann's trowsers.  This was apparently the result of a procedure that was performed on him by alien beings.<br /><br />I enjoy these books a lot but the reader must be very careful not to assume that Satanism and witchcraft are the same as other religions.  They are not.  As far as I've heard Aleister Crowley was a very evil man and wherever Crowley went blood shed was sure to follow as it apparently did at Montauk.  Some of the Montauk boys were beaten to death to try to get them to cooperate with the homosexual activities and time travel that were all part of the Montauk project.  My understanding is this was one of the things that drove Mr. Nichols and Dunkin Cameron to create a creature out of Dunkin's subconscious to destroy the equipment for the Montauk project.<br /><br />As I saidthis stuff gets really bizarre.<br /><br />I would never want to be involved in anything like this to the level that Mr. Nichols is.  Sooner or later they'll give you the old 'debriefing' treatment.

Traditionally held theories about the pyramids being tombs for pharoahs that were built by manual labor using primitive tools are completely disproved (anyone who thinks something like this could be built by people who hadn't discovered the wheel yet should be committed to a mental institution). As you read this book the terms \\"Queen's Chamber\\" and \\"King's Chamber\\" start to create confusion because according to Dunn these were not burial chambers at all.<br /><br />The pyramid builders were mysterious to the point of being almost frightening as far as what they were able to do. The reason we don't find additional archeological evidence of the ancient Egyptians' technology or an advanced society may be because they were not like us. If Dunn's theory is correct which I believe it is the ancient Egyptians had an understanding of the universe which is far beyond ours at this time. They may have had the ability to travel not only through space but through time as well or to other dimensions of reality. Although there is evidence that secret government agencies today do have knowledge of some of these advanced technologies such as time travel.<br /><br />A few reviewers have criticized the references to the Edgar Cayce readings but the author correctly realizes that a discussion of this subject should include theories about the possible origins of the pyramid builders and the society in which this pyramid was built. Cayce indicated that the ancient Egyptians were survivors of Atlantis which sank into the ocean as a result of misuse of technologies that were similar to the power ray described by Dunn's theory and also involvement in occult activities. Maybe one reason the technology of the ancient Egyptians disappeared is because the human race was entering a period of evolution which couldn't handle this type of power. Imagine what Hitler could have done with an anti gravity machine.<br /><br />The Cayce theory is that the human race actually started to de-volve after Atlantis sank. After the ancient Egyptians it appears that humanity became more and more entrenched in earthly problems such as war, slavery, disease, etc. So maybe the great pyramid stands as a monument to humanity's lost glory but we may yet power it back on sometime soon.<br /><br />Christopher Dunn should be commissioned to repair and resurrect the great pyramid. Who knows, maybe he was one of the people who built it.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181762 Gods of Eden: Egypt's Lost Legacy and the Genesis of Civilization]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044348 Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern Discoveries]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0932813380 The Giza Death Star]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0943358507 Initiation]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0918936217 Initiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591430453 Forbidden History: Prehistoric Technologies, Extraterrestrial Intervention, and the Suppressed Origins of Civilization]]t handle this type of power.

It contains things like:<br /><br /> -was Noah's arc a flying saucer<br /> -are there people living under the earth<br /> -who were the original people who lived in Atlantis.<br /><br />These things are interesting but have absolutely nothing to do with UFO conspiracies.<br /><br />The book jumps all over the place with stories about things like some guy who was enslaved in a cave in some desert somewhere by devils.<br /><br />The book has some value mainly for the sparce input provided by Al Bielek.  The experiences of Bielek related to the Philadelphia Experiment affected him deep within his soul.  He disappeared and his wife and child never found out what happened to him.  So much for the government's concern for those who participate in such dangerous activities.<br /><br />Some of the things Bielek says are very thought provoking but you won't find any good expansion of those topics here.<br /><br />Another problem is people try to speculate about the intentions of these weird alien creatures who impregnate females to create hybrid life forms.  They are evil.  That much is obvious.  They are just one form of an evil force that can take any form.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00079HZT8 Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TBYA06 The Truth About The Philadelphia Experiment]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345353358 Missing Time]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671797204 Secret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions]]	2002-04-03

I guess the Montauk project would be part of Phoenix.  This is one of those mysteries similar to the Kennedy assasination which won't go away because it's obvious that something really happened.<br /><br />I see no obvious contradictions in this book. What the author doesn't know he states. This makes sense because very few people if anyone would know everything about something like this. It's like the Kennedy assassination where everyone was lying to everyone else.<br /><br />It wouldn't be that easy to create a story like this if it wasn't true. However some readers will not be able to believe it because they can't go back and read about it in a college physics book. Remember Einstein said that 'imagination is more important than information'. With great minds such as Einstein, Van Neumann, and Tesla science begins to merge with philosophy and spirituality. That's because this is a spiritual universe we live in and God is spirit. The believer will trust that God understands these things and many more which are far beyond human comprehension.<br /><br />The people who ran these projects had little regard for human life. It sounds like they sent many a soul on a one way journey to who knows where and when.<br /><br />Awhile ago there was a story on America's Most Wanted about someone who had been in the rock band Iron Butterfly. He had been working with his father on some highly secret project that involved something about transmitting thoughts throughout the universe or something like that. They found him dead. These guys play for keeps and work outside the law and government.<br /><br />One of the reasons the author wanted to write this book was to make it more difficult for those who ran these projects to kill him. If someone becomes a problem for people like this they'll have an 'accident' or 'commit suicide'. ...<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0767906284 The Hunt for Zero Point:  Inside the Classified World of Antigravity Technology]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0963746766 Occult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)]]6284 The Hunt for Zero Point:  Inside the Classified World of Antigravity Technology]]    [[ASIN:0963746766 Occult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)]]	2002-03-29

C is something where you see a lot of different types of coding methods but you may not understand why something was done a certain way or if that is the best or even correct way to do it.  This is the type of book that helps to demystify things like that and I've seen at least two of the mistakes described in this book in programs.  I didn't fully understand everything in this book so I may pick it up again every once in awhile and review the things I highlighted for further review.  I'm getting into C++ now so maybe the author can write another book called 'deep c++ secrets' which would probably be about 5 times thicker than this one or maybe broken up into several volumes (he does provide one chapter on c++).	2002-01-02

I saw the author and the book on a Sightings segment for cattle mutilations.  This is a potentially very intriguing subject for those who enjoy paranormal subjects.      However I found that the book isn't structured well enough.  It jumps around talking about someone who saw some weird lights in the sky, an ambulance lost power for a few seconds, somebody picked up a hitchhiker who was a shape shifter, etc.      I don't doubt that these things can happen and there's a lot of good general info there but it could be structured better.      However it does hit on some interesting topics some of which could probably be expanded into entire books.      There's been ufo sightings and possibly crashes in the mysterious valley, cattle mutilations, and a lot of government secrecy.  The more serious readers would probably like to see any one of these topics researched and expanded on in a lot more detail.      The author indicates that a pregnant woman who was an employee of the government 'committed suicide' after finding out about something she would have been better off not knowing.  If this is true it's an insidious aspect of the ufo phenomenon and anyone who has done research about ufos will have seen this before.      The civilians at Roswell were threatened and a nurse was killed 'in a plane crash' after witnessing the alien autopsies.      According to Bob Lazar the government has worked with alien creatures on projects such as 'Looking Glass' that enabled them to see through time and they have saucers that crashed that they try to reverse engineer.      Anyway this book is no literary masterpiece but it does provide a lot of general info.      I may check out the book 'Alien Harvest' for more in depth coverage of the cattle mutilation subject.

For example some people cannot have occult objects such as ouija boards or Satanic literature in their homes. If they have these objects around they cannot sleep.  Last night I started hearing chanting, strange flutes, and rattles probably coming from the mysterious valley.<br /><br />These types of occult sounds are very strange.  They sound distant and blend in with other normal sounds in the house so you can't tell exactly where they come from.  But yet you know they are very real and it quickly gets to a point that any sound you hear scares the living hell out of you.  You start to be afraid for no apparent reason.<br /><br />The horrible occult forces normally don't bother people unless they feel someone wants to get involved with them which is the most unfortunate of mistakes a person can make.<br /><br />Somehow my having The Myserious Valley indicated my potential interest for this involvement so I had to throw it away so I could go back to sleep. I wasn't planning on throwing it away since I usually save my books.<br /><br />Anyway this book about the mysterious valley with it's animal mutilations and other paranormal phenomenon created a reaction for me with the terrible occult forces.<br /><br />I don't know if others would experience the same thing or if they did they would be able to recognize what I perceive as the potential danger or maybe for them having this book would not be dangerous.<br /><br />As I said I've had similar experiences with things like Satanic books such as The Necronomicon and it happened when I got some videos about that guy in Sweden who films real ufos.<br /><br />I always have to destroy this material or I can't sleep.  I suspect if I chose not to destroy them things would happen to disrupt my life such as making serious mistakes at work, health problems, car crashes, and  general mental problems and insanity.<br /><br />Another possibility might be things would change completely and be wonderful (for me) in an unrealistic way if I chose to accept and agree to a commitment with the forces of darkness but horrible things would probably happen to those I care about.  But if I were to make such a commitment that would mean I don't care about anyone other than myself.<br /><br />I think most people who have studied about ufos for awhile will start to notice that there is a negative aspect to the phenomenon.  There are often suicides and accidents that appear to really be murders perpetrated by mysterious government agencies. Fear. Confusion.<br /><br />The Mysterious Valley has all of these things.  Now that I think of it The Mysterious Valley mentions The Leviathon which is one of the occult gods.<br /><br />The occult is probably most dangerous when people want to use it to harm others such as putting a curse on someone although I don't claim to be an expert on the subject.  Don't ever say you want to put a curse on someone even if you don't mean it.  Your worst nightmare may become a reality.<br /><br />Satan himself is not the monster that people think but most people should probably not worship Satan as a religion.  If they do it's not just him involved.  Others get involved.  The occult creatures will show no mercy and there is no escape or protection from them.  These are the creatures in the universe who have chosen the path of darkness, selfishness, anger, hatred, etc.. They can take on human form or use real people to do things.<br /><br />The Leviathon is very old, older than the mysterious valley.<br /><br />I guess I probaly won't get that other book about the cattle mutilations.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345353358 Missing Time]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671797204 Secret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00079HZT8 Alien Autopsy: Factor Fiction?]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000TBYA06 The Truth About The Philadelphia Experiment]]	2001-05-29

It was the title that intrigued me and made me want to read this book. Leonardo's education and maturation process in relation to painting is really not that unusual.<br />This book does demonstrate with a lot of precise details how Leonardo's involvement and association with paintings from his early period can be proven or disproven. In some cases advanced scientific techniques such as x-ray analysis are cited to disprove or clarify statements made by previous authors about Leonardo's supposed involvement in various paintings. This book would be very helpful if someone was, for example, writing a paper about Leonardo's early career as far as exactly what paintings he worked on.<br />However the mysterious aspect about Leonardo da Vinci is not his painting which he eventually grew tired of and he sometimes didn't even bother to finish his own paintings. The mysterious thing about Leonardo is how did he all of a sudden become (at least in his own mind) an engineer, architect, scientist, etc., when he was never trained in any of these things ? How did someone who was trained as a painter and artist make that transition ? That's where the mystery deepens about Leonardo da Vinci.<br />As far as the books I've read so far that mystery has never been fully explained other than he was self taught. His art was very important for this transition because it allowed him to record his basically limitless ideas at a time when photography didn't exist yet.<br />But a good follow on to this book would be called 'Leonardo Da Vinci Origins Of A RENAISSANCE Genius' or 'Scientific Genius' or something like that.<br />Whether some or most of Leonardo's scientific ideas were valid is I think open to debate. But he did have some of the characteristics required for true genius which are intense curiosity, being very observant, and having almost unlimited energy. And he was a good painter, that much can be stated positively.t much can be stated positively.	2001-03-11

Cayce provides a similar type of insight into the entire history of the human race.<br /><br />What started with the first human (Adam) reaches a sort of conclusion with Christ who Cayce indicates was in fact Adam.<br /><br />Even so some of these ideas are still mysterious and hard to understand.<br /><br />I assume this same process has occurred on many, many other planets and that Christ died on many planets.<br /><br />It would have been very interesting to talk to Edgar Cayce because he had the ability, as did Christ Himself, to point out what was either really good or really bad in people.  People can have very positive characteristics which they don't even realize they have such as being patient or understanding.<br /><br />Like the other two books in this series many interesting insights are provided about people such as John the Baptist who was also Elijah.  When you think about it John the Baptist did have a tendency to say things that were probably better left unsaid.  It was his criticizing of Herod's adulterous relationship with his wife that caused the wife to hate the Baptist and to cause his death.  This wife was a reincarnation of the infamous Jezebel in the bible.<br /><br />I assume this was a continuation of this soul's journey that will eventually end in hell since it takes multiple lifetimes to lose your soul.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876042167 Lives of the Master: The Rest of the Jesus Story]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1585423157 The Essential Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425103277 Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044771 Jesus: His Words Decoded, His Mystery Teachings Revealed]]	2001-02-22

Maybe God caused this so that Cayce could use his miraculous psychic abilities to explain the bible which is something Cayce wanted to do to help others.<br /><br />The discussion is mainly about the different people who became leaders of the Israelites during this time period when they went from judges to kings.  A re-occurring theme is that every person receives from God abilities, opportunities, and free will.<br /><br />Cayce's view of the greatest potential achievements of a person is to know God's will in their life and to strive to achieve this by working with God.<br /><br />Solomon probably represents the best example of someone who achieved greatness as Cayce viewed greatness by being in tune with God's direction.  But then Solomon gave in to the negative side of his nature and abondoned his former glory.  This is after God had told Solomon there had never been anyone like him before nor would there be anyone like him again on earth and this came true.<br /><br />This is especially significant seeing that Solomon was a wealthy person who had access to women and anything else he wanted already.  So Solomon developed a desire to reject God for no other reason than he wanted to.<br /><br />Cayce indicated during his bible study sessions that \\"Very few people can stand prosperity and Solomon was not one of the few.\\"<br /><br />Cayce actually feared becomming wealthy based on his knowledge of what happened to Solomon which is an indication of the greatness of this man who I have come to admire.<br /><br />The lesson is that anyone, no matter how much God has been a part of their life or chosen them, can reject God at any time.  This was true even of Christ Himself.<br /><br />And if the individual chooses to reject the spiritual values this has implications not only for them but for others, maybe even for an entire nation or an entire world.<br /><br />As Spiderman's uncle Ben told him:<br /><br />'With great power comes great responsibility'.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001I55O2 Spider-Man - The '67 Collection (6 Volume Animated Set)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876042167 Lives of the Master: The Rest of the Jesus Story]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876043503 The Lives of Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425103277 Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044771 Jesus: His Words Decoded, His Mystery Teachings Revealed]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044682 Edgar Cayce on the Revelation: A Study Guide for Spiritualizing Body and Mind]]rs, maybe even for an entire nation or an entire world.

I suspect these souls were people who would later be involved in His crucifixion so maybe this was His revenge for events that would happen in the future. I believe a person can affect the past by things they do now or in the future since God exists outside of time.<br /><br />An important question is raised about why Christianity considered and continues to consider the idea of reincarnation heresy.<br /><br />Cayce indicates it was a short cut intended to simplify the information for the masses.  Certainly something was lost there but at least this information is now available for those who want to explore the idea further.<br /><br />The art work on the cover of the book is nice also.  The background is from the famous painting by Michaelangelo from the Cistine chapel I think and then at the bottom there are smaller pictures related to some of the life experiences of 'the Master'.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425093204 Edgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of man]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425103277 Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876041144 Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of Moses]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044771 Jesus: His Words Decoded, His Mystery Teachings Revealed]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000CRPF1K The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]gs Revealed]]    [[ASIN:B000CRPF1K The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]	2001-02-09

(Edgar Cayce's own life story is itself fascinating.)<br /><br />Anyone who wants to really understand the bible and human existence itself would want to read this book.<br /><br />But this type of information is not for the skeptical.  It requires faith and an open mind.  This book contains information which could only be obtained psychically.  For example there would be no way to know that Eve and Mary were the same soul entity just by studying historical documents.<br /><br />This book indicates how intelligent life first starting appearing on and affecting the earth going back hundreds of thousands of years.  Not surprisingly the selfish force manifested itself almost immediately with horrible consequences.<br /><br />Explanations are given for the legends of mythology and other myths.<br /><br />Quite a bit is explained about Moses and the many strange events surrounding the Exodus and wanderings of the Israelites.  Moses was a very passionate person who killed an Egytpian that had messed around with his sister apparently in some disrespectful way.<br /><br />This is an interesting example of how Cayce's version of the event differs from the biblical version.  Obviously Moses was enraged by this event and the general injustice being perpetrated against the Israelites by the Egyptians at that time.<br /><br />To say Moses was a mysterious person would be a gross understatement. He was a god like creature.  The book doesn't state this but I would suspect that maybe Moses and Abraham were the same soul entity in different forms.  Both spoke directly to God in some way.<br /><br />But it was Moses who dramatically demonstrated an intimate knowledge of God's powers. For example when the Khoras rebelled Moses indicated they would fall into the earth as the result of some type of earthquake. And they did !<br /><br />But Moses had his problems and made his mistakes which is consistent with the idea of the soul learning during the earthly existence.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book there is an indication that Satan and the arch angel Michael somehow argued over or about the physical dead body of Moses.  I'm not sure what that means but I think it indicates Moses had very pronounced characteristics for both good and evil.  Both of these forces influenced Moses as I suspect they do for most people.<br /><br />Cayce indicated that Moses working with Joshua wrote at least some of the book of Genesis as well as other parts of the old testament while in a state of deep meditation.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425093204 Edgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of man]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876043503 The Lives of Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876042167 Lives of the Master: The Rest of the Jesus Story]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]y existence.

I wrote a letter to the author and got a response back.<br /><br />This book is excellent in giving detailed information about what exactly happens during these bizzare abduction experiences.  It goes beyond just physical activities to indicate what is going on in the abductee's mind.<br /><br />AND IT AIN'T PRETTY !  An abduction experience is a form of spiritual possession and overpowering. The abductee can feel the strange alien force enter their mind and body through their eyes at which point they can feel the alien presense taking control of them completely.<br /><br />After reading many books about ufo abductions and based on my own religious beliefs my conclusion is the alien force is a parasitical force on the human race.  The alien creature seaks to create hybrid life forms by exploiting the life force that exists within every human being.<br /><br />Most likely every human being has something infinitely valuable within them and the alien creature seeks to exploit this for their own purposes.  I suspect like vampires they have to do this because their own species is continuously dying out because they are evil creatures who seek to create life in a selfish way.<br /><br />Evidence indicates the alien creatures have the power to place a spirit into a human embryo which they have been involved in fertilizing so that the person who is born is actually an alien in human form. But I guess everyone is an alien in that sense.  But that's why the abductees sometimes feel a certain bond with the alien creatures.  They are alien spirits themselves.<br /><br />The alien / occult force seems to exist in parallel with the Creative force that most people are familiar with. These evil alien creatures sometimes crash their spaceships as happened in Roswell, New Mexico.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00079HZT8 Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345353358 Missing Time]]act from Planet Iarga]]    [[ASIN:0345353358 Missing Time]]	2001-02-06

I thought it was good enough to buy the second edition.<br /><br />If you ever watch the commercials on TV during the evening news you would think pretty much everyone in the United States has something wrong with their stomach.  That is not too far off.<br /><br />I've seen tv commercials encouraging teenagers to start taking laxatives.<br /><br />This book is good because it gives real life examples and doesn't try to tell anyone to always eat pefectly which is basically impossible and even if it is possible the person would die of monotony probably. For example I used to eat 3 or 4 pork chops at one meal but the book says meat should not be as significant a part of the diet. This causes you to lose weight also in a safe way.<br /><br />The biggest thing I think is the part about exercise.  The book says go for a long walk every night.<br /><br />If you do this and also identify things you may not be able to digest such as milk you shouldn't have too many stomach problems.  There's milk out now called 'Lactaid' which has the lactose enzyme added in.<br /><br />Those who don't do these things will ultimately try to treat their problems with over the counter or prescription drugs rather than attack the problems at the source.<br /><br />Updated 12/23/07<br />-----------------<br />Since I read this book and wrote the original review I have learned more about diet.  The hell that I went through with my stomach was mainly caused by flooding my system with white sugar and other refined sweeteners such as high fructose corn syrup.  White sugar is basically a poison for the body.  The soft drink and candy companies are poisoning America and the the entire world really with this crap.<br /><br />White sugar attacks and weakens the immune system.  When I removed it from my diet I lost my allergies for trees, grasses, molds, and ragweed.<br /><br />But you have to beware of so called 'sugar free' candy and other things also.  These contain the sugar alcohols which are even worse than white sugar.<br /><br />What you should look for is raw (not necessarily organic) sugar.<br /><br />An emerging discovery in the area of natural health is maintaing the proper Ph level in the body's chemistry.<br /><br />  Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000LKZK7C Sugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0961959533 Alkalize or Die]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0892810998 The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health: Restore Your Health by Creating Balance in Your Diet]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FH19D0 McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, Traditional, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)]]even worse than white sugar.

For example in 'The Last Supper' the figures are arranged in a unique way and 'The Virgin of the Rocks' introduced completely new ideas.<br /><br />Many other painters benefitted and used some of these ideas.<br /><br />Leonardo had a tremendous talent for painting the human face and accurately capturing the affects of light and shadow in paintings.<br /><br />He viewed painting as a science really which I think was more or less one of his unique characteristics.<br /><br />This book also mentions some of Leonardo's criticisms of others.  Leonardo was never one to hesitate to criticize other people.  He made a famous statement one time that many people are nothing more than consumers of food and producers of waste.	2000-12-07

I bought it after seeing the author on the A & E Biography episode about Leonardo.<br /><br />On the show the author indicated that Leonardo was not at all like a modern scientific thinker.<br /><br />I think people can relate to Da Vinci more easily than they can to someone like Einstein.  Einstein  could not have painted the Mona Lisa but then Leonardo didn't invent the theory of relativity either.<br /><br />But the Mona Lisa is something that the  average guy on the street can relate to while the theory of relativity can only be understood mainly by scientists.<br /><br />Da Vinci may not have been so  much a genius as someone who did many things well and had a very active and  energetic mind. He represents as much the spirit of achievement as actual  achievements.  He seemed to have so much mental energy that learning was something he simply had to do.  It was not optional for him.<br /><br />What makes Da Vinci interesting is the unique combination of artistic and scientfic interests that he had.  Some of Leonardo's notebooks were recovered relatively recently from a historical point of view so the idea of da Vinci as a Renaissance genius is a pretty new idea.<br /><br />At the end the book he attempts to maybe clarify and expand on the earlier material so that Leonardo can be re-invented hopefully more accurately for our era.  In  fact if Leonardo da Vinci had never existed someone probably would have invented a fictional person like him.  Someone who knew basically everything which of course Leonardo did not but people sometimes like to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Quite a bit is said about the Mona Lisa.  The Mona Lisa appears to be a self portrait by Leonardo, not of his  physical life as Leonardo, but of his soul.  Old, peaceful, content,  mysterious.<br /><br />It also talks about a painting of some guy with snakes crawling out of his head which was mistakenly (?) attributed to Leonardo for many years.  Leonardo had some problems.<br /><br />The author expresses some resentment that the fields related to the humanities are held in low esteem these days by some people.  The author's writing style indicates he's into philosophy.  This is not a book for someone trying to get a general idea of what Leonardo was interested in and why he is considered by some to be a genius.

As far as his actual technical ahievements this book doesn't get into that too much but as another reviewer pointed out this book is mainly about his art.  It may be difficult to know all of what he accomplished due to the lack of accurate records back then.<br /><br />Leonardo was an odd ball and sort of an enigma who was unusual to the point of being almost mystical. He was said to possess almost superhuman strength and 'just to see him made you happy'.<br /><br />Leonardo was constantly learning and becomming more mature throughout his life so things said at a younger age may not reflect his thought processes later in life.<br /><br />Leonardo was not a homosexual... That was only a rumor. I suspect it was this subject that created the apparent rift between him and Michaelangelo. However maybe Leonardo and Michaelangelo did get along ok and the argument mentioned in this book was an isolated case.<br /><br />For all his genious and abilities Leonardo was melancholy sometimes and at one point became so angry about money that it became almost scandalous. Just being alive back then was a hardship due to the state of medical science and the high level of political corruption. Leonardo worked for people who got into power by murdering their political enemies.<br /><br />All in all he did ok. There were a lot of people back then who just died of the plague and nobody wrote any books about them. At least he didn't get burned at the stake by the Church or something like that for doing autopsies. That was around the time of the Spanish Inquisition when things were done to people that made battle hardened soldiers crynge with fear.<br /><br />Leonardo was somewhat of a mystery and his relationship with Salai only adds to this mystery. It seems that Leonardo was looking for a true friend in Salai but he did not find it. After Leonardo's death someone killed Salai. Salai did things that were basically wrong and this was a learning experience.<br /><br />\\"Study me reader, if you find delight in me, for on very few occasions shall I return to the world...\\" - Leonardo da Vinci (on painting)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0865163480 Plato: Apology]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]a learning experience.     \\"Study me reader, if you find delight in me, for on very few occasions shall I return to the world...\\" - Leonardo da Vinci (on painting)    [[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]    [[ASIN:0865163480 Plato: Apology]]    [[ASIN:0876044380 Edgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever Known]]    [[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]	2000-05-28

I could not put this book down.<br /><br />This must certainly be a unique situation.  Has anyone ever written a book that exposes corruption while at the same time provides information that could solve a murder investigation?<br /><br />The re-occurring theme is about a guy who is surrounded by corruption and hypocrasy but is powerless to do anything about it.  There's an underlying rage that's constantly boiling just below the surface of this entire book.<br /><br />Finally the pot boils over.  The Boulder, Colorodo criminal justice system is exposed...  That's just the tip of the iceburg.<br /><br />The author went through a lot of hardship during this process including health problems.  I assume this book will be a best seller for a long time so at least he will be well compensated.<br /><br />As far as the murder itself this thing keeps getting weirder all the time.  This child suffered tremendously.<br /><br />Even with all of the corruption the author and his few trusted assistants did eventually piece together what happened.<br /><br />This is assuming you believe his theory.  I do and apparently most law enforcment officials outside of Boulder do also.  The solving of this mystery was basically a miracle given the circumstances.<br /><br />This book is invaluable because it provides insights which are not available from reading about this case in newspapers or seeing it on tv.  This is a guy who knew what really happened and he's not afraid to name names.	2000-05-28

This book is not about describing near death experiences although some are described, mainly the author's.  It's about understanding the experience and making recommendations about how to deal with the affects of the experience.  There's quite a bit of material about philosophy and making correlations between main stream religious or philosophical ideas and the near death experience.<br /><br />I would say a near death experience is consistent with the belief systems of most religions including Christian religions.  The individual's entire life flashes before them instantly and they understand how everything they did affected any other person.<br /><br />The author came close to dying several times I think and describes her experiences and tells how she attempted to deal with and understand these experiences.<br /><br />She also tries to find similarities with others who have had similar  experiences.  These experiences are much more common today than in the past due to the ability of doctors to revive people who are almost dead.  I believe nowadays for some delicate medical procedures people are almost put into a death state to greatly reduce blood flow.<br /><br />I'm inserting a product link for the book by Howard Storm where he talks about going to hell for a time.<br /><br />The author suspected that sometimes people don't often talk about going down there.  Going to hell is an indication that a person's life has truly been a failure and that the person is bad.<br /><br />This book is mainly positive.

Here's a  tormented soul who was sexually molested, raped by sex fiends, and slit her wrists twice by the time she reached about age 20.<br /><br />The father can take  credit for the rape.  He allowed a 12 year old girl to go to a strange house with strange people who he knew were in the pornography business.  Anyone with even minimal intelligence would realize this was a dangerous situation for a young girl.<br /><br />She was wreckless and exploitive of herself also.  Prostitution is after all an exploitive activity.<br /><br />The second case study came very close to getting pulled into a white slavery ring in Paris.  This was done under the guise of a modelling engagement by an enterprising individual who turned out to be cunning, devious, and sinister.<br /><br />If that would have happened the things in this book would be kids' stuff compared to what would have happened to her.  I assume her family and friends would never have seen or heard from her again.<br /><br />Girls thinking about getting into prostitution should be intelligent about going to strange places with strange people, especially about going to another country.  In a situation  like that the line between asking someone to do something and forcing them  against their will is very thin.  You can never be sure who you'll run into in that business.<br />Danger and death are always lurking in the shadows of this dark world.<br /><br />The sequel to this book, \\"Once More With Feeling\\", gives a better idea of the negative side of prostitution.  They all don't go to parties at mansions and make tons of money.  As this book shows even those that do are miserable anyway.  Many don't escape with their lives.<br /><br />Not that this book presents prostitution as a bed of roses either.<br /><br />There are  some common denominators that lead girls onto this path:<br /><br />1) lack of family structure or abusive home life<br /><br />2) drug abuse which impairs judgement<br /><br />3) enticement of 'easy' money and luxury<br /><br />4) naivety and lack of experience in life<br /><br />5) no way to support themselves financially (caused by other factors  above like drugs)<br /><br />6) to some extent low self esteem and self respect<br /><br />Most of the girls in both books have at least some of these characteristics.pe with their lives.
