There are other books I read merely because I think they will contain some information that will be useful to me in life or in ministry.  Then there are some books which are flat out difficult for me to read.  Yet I read them to stretch myself and broaden my horizons.  <br /> <br />Such is the book The Soul of Science by Nancy Pearcey and Charles Thaxton.  It's not the book is any way deficient, as can be seen by the endorsements of the book.  Phillip E. Johnson says this is a \\"brilliant book that deserves a wide readership.\\"  J. P. Moreland says it would be an excellent text for courses on science and religion. James W. Sire says that \\"this book should destroy for all time the persistent myth that Science and Christianity have always been at war with each other.\\"  <br /> <br />Truly, this is a great book, but it was difficult for me to read, being a non-scientist.  And when I say that I am a non-scientist I am giving myself far too much praise and credit as a scientific scholar.  I have always done poorly in science.  I somehow survived all of the biology classes I had to take in High School and College and nearly bombed out in chemistry.  The fact that I passed a required chemistry class in college, I attribute to either the generosity of the professor or that he was in a drunken stupor when he was handing out grades.  I went to college hoping to be an engineer but abandoned all hope of such a career when I took my first physics class.  The only time in my life I can ever remember having a complete mental block in a subject was when I took that physics class - I just couldn't get it.  Two weeks into the semester I dropped the class and changed my major.  <br /> <br />So, I read this book as a non-scientist and want to share a few thoughts on its value to non-scientists like me.  For a good review from a technical standpoint you'll have to look elsewhere.  The book has lots of interesting information about biology, mathematics, quantum mechanics and DNA, to which the most intelligent response I can give is \\"wow . . . hey, . . .  that's um . . .  interesting, . . . that's really groovy man.\\"  In other words, it all sounds pretty neat but I don't understand much of what I read.  <br /> <br />What I did understand though, and what makes this book valuable to a scientific ignoramus like me is that all science has an underlying philosophy.  Science is supposed to be one field of study where you just deal with bare facts, where the facts speak for themselves, where empiricism rules the day.  Yet, the project of science itself depends on certain philosophical underpinnings.  <br /> <br />The project of science begins with a presupposition that the world around us is real and understandable.  This is not something native to all societies and Pearcey and Thaxton point out what many historians agree on - that Christianity is the native soil out of which the scientific enterprise grew.  The Christian worldview says that there is a God, a God of order, who created a world of order.  Thus the earliest scientists sought to understand the world that God created, to think His thoughts after Him.  Science was a means of knowing God and giving praise to Him.  <br /> <br />Thus, the notion that there is some kind of hostility between science and Christianity is false.  The hostility that arose between science and Christianity arose as scientists abandoned Christian presuppositions for atheistic presuppositions.  <br /> <br />However, it is not as if there is a \\"Christian philosophy of science\\" and an \\"atheist philosophy of science.\\"  Pearcey and Thaxton demonstrate that, historically, there have been three dominant philosophies of science.  All three have morphed at times, but the basic philosophies are Aristotelian, Neo-Platonic and Mechanistic.  <br /> <br />Aristotle pictured the world as a vast organism.  He believed that all forms of motion or change areaccomplished because of an objects built in purpose or goal.  Aristotle described things using metaphors of living organisms, not machines.  Aristotelianism  was rationalistic, viewing God as a rational mind whose thoughts are known by logical analysis.  The development of living organisms was driven by some kind of internal pattern that assured they fulfilled their goal or purpose.  <br /> <br />The Neo-Platonists were similar to Aristotelians in that they believed the world was a living organism.  However, they differed in that how they explained this:  \\"In explaining natural processes, it appealed not to rational Forms but to the creative power of spiritual forces.  These forces were often regarded as divine, or at least as avenues of divine activity in the world.  <br /> <br />The mechanistic worldview rejected Aristotelianism and Neo-Platonism in that it didn't see the world as a living organism, rather as a machine with God as the chief engineer.  <br /> <br />Pearcey and Thaxton point out that there are many nuances within these basic worldviews and the worldviews are applied somewhat differently in different disciplines.  Further, these are rough groupings and some scientists would be hard to categorize.  But, for Pearcey and Thaxton, these worldviews are portrayed as the grid through which almost all scientific disciplines are pursued.  They also point out that, historically, each of these worldviews have been used in service to both Christianity and non-Christianity.  Hence, the obvious implication is that there are certain faith commitments that form an even deeper sub-strata beneath the philosophies themselves.   <br /> <br />I say that I didn't understand most of the more technical stuff in the book, but there were some nuggets that got through my thick skull.  There is a fascinating chapter on the fall of mathematics from its pinnacle as the ultimate source of empirical certainty.  And the chapter on DNA is wonderful.  The complexity and volume of information contained in DNA gives wonderful testimony to the existence of a creator and to the notion that we are fearfully and wonderfully made.   <br /> <br />But the bottom line value of the book is that it will help us look beyond the facts in discussions about Christianity and Science.  Very often, Christian apologists seek to go head to head with non-Christian scientists in regards to evidences.  The Christian piles up a stack of evidence that he says proves the existence of God or the Christian worldview, and the non-Christian piles up a similar stack of evidence against him.  They both attack the others stacks of evidences and defend their own.  The outcome sometimes looks like an office where both stacks of paper have been blown around the room resulting in chaos.  <br /> <br />We need to look beyond the \\"bare facts\\" (there is no such thing as a \\"bare\\" fact) to the philosophical foundations behind them.  In that regard, the Christian worldview provides a remarkable foundation for science.  <br /> <br />\\"The Soul of Science\\" affirms the words of Max Planck who says \\"Over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: 'Ye must have faith.'\\"	2005-04-05
US	49043469	RYYGVYWD0PLC3	0976035715	431755756	Pocket Guide To The Apocalypse: The Official Field Manual For The End Of The World	Books	5	28	29	N	N	A Great  Display of the Folly of End Times Date Setting	Jason Boyett is the author of A Guy's Guide to Life,  Things You Should Know By Now, and a few others.  With this new book he is branching out into the field of end times prognostication and date setting.  Or, maybe I should say that with this book he is branching out to show the folly of those who would try to be end times prognosticators and date setters.  <br /> <br />Jason's books are targeted at a younger audience, those in and around the quarter-century age range.  As such, while I was reading his book I felt very old, almost as if I was in my forties or something.  The book is full of youthful slang and otherwise hip language.  It's not what I am used to or the way I usually speak, but ol' gramps here can understand that it communicates especially well to youngsters.  Which is not to say that it doesn't communicate well to us old timers, because it does.  But the style is definitely aimed at a younger audience. <br /> <br />In fact, after I read it I came home one day to find my 13 year old son reading it.  My son is an avid reader of sci-fi, especially the Star Wars books.  He will read 2-3 Star Wars books in a week at times but he has never been excited about reading religious books.  But he is enjoying this one very much.  <br /> <br />The book is written in a very snarky, comedic tone.  But, Jason has done a remarkable thing in being snarky without being mean spirited.  I have to admit that, when I started reading the book I had my antennas up a bit, thinking he might go overboard.  But, though he poked fun where fun needed to be poked throughout the book, there was no malice in any of it.  While some may want to scold Jason for being so flippant, the truth is that all of the date-setting and anti-Christ predicting that goes on these days is quite ridiculous and there is something to be said for treating these things as the ridiculous things they are. <br /> <br />Because of the slang, the hipness and the snarkiness of the book you might be tempted not totake it seriously.  And while this may never be a Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society Book of the Month selection, you would be surprised at the depth of material he has included here.  There is a good deal of research beneath the humor.  Jason has done an excellent job of describing all of the major eschatological positions and has fairly outlined their positions, along with their strengths and weaknesses.  I particularly appreciate this, because when you are talking eschatology, it is easy to caricature the different views, especially the ones you disagree with. <br /> <br />The book is most effective in chapters 2-3 where he gives an extensive catalogue of end times date setters throughout history.  I'm no eschatological scholar, but I've done a fair amount of research into eschatology and he has found a bunch of date setters that I was unaware of.  I say that these chapters are the most effective because this is where his snarkiness is most appropriate.  If there is one group of people throughout history who deserve snark, satire and caustic wit it is date setters.  As Jason says, if there is one passage of Scripture that many eschatological literalists fail to take literally, it is the words of Jesus that no man knows the date or hour of his return. <br /> <br />These two chapters list dozens of end-times date setting scenarios and the cumulative effect is greater than the sum of the parts.  While I don't remember every detail of every date-setting scheme that is listed in this book, the sheer volume of them speaks volumes.  Someone who reads something like this and still wants to predict the date of Jesus' return will have to ask themselves, \\"what makes you different from every other date setter who has been wrong throughout history?\\" <br /> <br />Along with chapters 2-3, he is also effective in chapter 4 as he lists several candidates for Anti-Christ.  If the favorite sport of some is date setting, the second favorite is \\"guess the anti-Christ.\\"Jason lists several potential anti-Christs, including Nero, Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbechev, Bill Clinton, Saddam Hussein, the Pope, Prince Charles and Bill Gates.  Again, his sarcastic style is effective here in showing the silliness of the whole enterprise of seeking to guess the anti-Christ. <br /> <br />I will quibble with him on a few things.  As he went through all of the date setters I was aghast that he could have left Harold Camping off his list.  Jason, Jason, Jason - you'll  have to include something on him in a future edition.  We amils have always been pretty smug, thinking that date setting was the private domain of wacked out dispensationalists.  But Harold Camping is an amil and his antics have wiped those smug looks off our faces.  Camping is the closest thing we've got to a William Miller for this generation.  Hal Lindsey is a close second, but Camping takes the lead. <br /> <br />Also, just because it is one of my pet hobby horses, I want to point out that this book makes the mistake of saying that premillenialism was the dominant belief of the early church.  It's understandable why the author would say this, as it is a point that has been proclaimed by nearly all premillenialists and conceded by most post and a- millenialists.  However, it is not at all certain that all, or even a majority of early church fathers were premil.  In his book Regnum Caelorum, Dr. Charles E. Hill shows that there was a diversity of opinion of millennial views amongst the church fathers.   True, there were some premils, there were many who weren't, and there were many more for whom a millenial position was hard to nail down.  I only bring this up because, as I said, it is a hobby horse of mine (and probably no one else really cares) and because this argument carries great weight with many.  Many believe that the doctrines held by the early church fathers carry greater weight in these debates because they lived closer to the time of Christ.  Their nearness to the timeof Christ is what gives them the greater weight. <br /> <br />He also includes an interview with Paul Meier, formerly half of the Minirith-Meier team, who is also an end-times aficionado.  Meier is interesting and puzzling.  He thinks you can tell alot about a person by their millenial view.  Because I believe that the church has inherited the eschatological promises given to Israel I am supposed to be a guilt-ridden, yet well educated and financially well off perfectionist who is so insecure that I have thrown Israel out as God's favorite child and put myself in his place - huh??  On the other hand, Meier, being a dispensationalist, shows a fair amount of humility regarding end times views, and this is refreshing. <br /> <br />All in all I enjoyed the book and can recommend it highly.  Like I said at the beginning, the writing style is not exactly up the ally of many of us old geezers, but this would be a good book to give to a younger person who wants an introduction to eschatology.  It would also be a good book to give to someone who is an eschatological fanatic.  Hopefully, the witty, sarcastic tone will help them to see that no one is really taking them seriously, so they shouldn't take themselves so seriously.	2005-04-05
US	49043469	R37HHI0D7MDRBL	0812970802	670191536	Girl Meets God: A Memoir	Books	4	63	74	N	N	Winsome	Lauren Winner strikes me as the kind of person who could be the ultimate dinner guest.  She's young and energetic, interested and interesting, together and a mess, mature and girlish, saint and sinner.   For such a young lady she is incredibly well read and knows all kinds of things about all kinds of topics.  If her writing style is any indication she has an abundance of charm, and she is opinionated enough to be provocative and self-effacing enough to be humble. <br />This book is her tale of walking into Orthodox Judaism, out of it to Christianity, and her attempts to synthesize some elements of her Jewish background with her newfound faith in Christ. <br />The story is valuable to Christians simply for the insight it gives into Judaism.  Lauren was a convert to Judaism, she wasn't born in an orthodox Jewish household.  Thus, she became an orthodox Jew by conviction, and through much study.  She didn't merely adopt the ways of the Jewish faith in an unthinking manner, she studied it in depth and adopted it throughout the process of a long intellectual and spiritual struggle. <br />A similar thing happened with her conversion to Christ.  Through a period of study and a series of events she felt Christ calling her.  As, little by little,  she came to believe that Christ was real and that He had truly come in the flesh, she found herself irresistably drawn to Christ. <br />None of us can ever escape our own biases when reading something and I can't escape mine in reading this account.  Lauren came into the branch of Christianity known as the Episcopal Church.  As one who is from the Reformed tradition, I would wish that in her journey to Christianity she had continued all the way to Geneva, and not stopped in London.  I recoil at her use of icons in worship.  She seems to me to rely too heavily on the Book of Common Prayer, and not the Bible.  So, I doubt that I will wholeheartedly recommend this as an evangelistic tract, simply because she doesn't &quot;speak my language.&quot;  Yet, I do recommend it to the discerning reader of a wonderfully honest, earthy story of the struggles involved in one person's journey to faith. <br />Also, one of the benefits of this book is that she is just so well read.  She understands the nuances of the different evangelical subcultures, talks intelligently about historical events in the church and raises important theological topics.  Although she doesn't always come down on my side of things she talks intelligentl about them all.  If nothing else, this book is a testament to the value of reading in a person's life.  She is very young and yet very well rounded, and this well-roundedness can only be explained by her voracious appetite for reading.  One of my favorite anecdotes in the book is her story of how her mother used to have some kind of obligation she had to attend each week.  Her mother would take Lauren, with her, give her $5.00 and send her to the pizza place next door and tell her to get something to eat.  Trouble is, there was a bookstore right there to.  So, Lauren says that she was faced with her weekly dilemma of whether or not to eat dinner or buy a book - I love it. <br />It's a good book and I can enthusiastically recommend it, with the aforementioned caveats.	2004-05-16

S. Lewis's Narnia series) I write this review with the knowledge that there are probably many things I don't get in this story. Therefore, this review will probably lack some of the depth that could come from a more knowledgeable reader.  However, maybe as an &quot;outsider&quot; to the sci-fi genre I'll have a few worthwhile thoughts. <br />Ender Wiggin is a tormented child genius, charged with saving the earth from alien invaders.  The book tells the story of how Ender is recognized as the potential &quot;savior of the earth&quot;, how he is trained and how he ultimately defeats the alien invaders. <br />The plot is a good one, but the development of the character of Ender is the highlight of the book.  When we first meet him, he is the kid who gets picked on by his evil older brother and the bullies in the neighborhood.  Ender is a sensitive kid who doesn't want to hurt anyone.  However, throughout the book he is put into positions where he has to defend himself.  When he does defend himself he doesn't merely defeat his enemy, he destroys him.  Then he feels guilty about it afterward. <br />The rulers of the earth monitor Ender and notice this, along with his brilliance in computer simulated war games.  The earth has been attacked twice by alien invaders and nearly wiped out each time.  The powers that be expect another alien invasion and so they conscript Ender into leading them in battle against these aliens. <br />While Ender is whisked away into outer space to be trained to save the earth, back on earth his evil brother Peter concocts a plan to rule the earth, and he conscripts his and Ender's sister, Valentine to join him in this.  Peter and Valentine take on cyber identities of Locke and Demosthenes and interject themselves and their opinions into the affairs of the day, and eventually grow to wield great power on the earth. <br />There is a sense in whichthis is a psychological thriller because much of the story has to do with what is going on in Ender's head.  Here he is, the sensitive young boy (did I mention he is only 10?) who is being taught to destroy others and eventually destroy an entire alien race.  His interior wrestlings with this dominate the book.  We also see him agonize with fears of becomgin like his brother Peter, and deal with the fact that the world leaders are using him. <br />The fact that the author chose the names Demosthenes and Locke for two of the main supporting characters is interesting.  Demosthenes is an ancient Greek writer known for his orations against Phillip of Macedon and Locke is known for his anti-authoritarian views.  Since I don't know what was going on in the head of Orson Scott Card when he was writing I can only speculate why he chose these names.  As Demosthenes and Locke, Valentine and Phillip do, over time, undermine the existing authorities and raise themselves to levels of power. This hints at one of the subtle messages of the book, which is certainly seen in the case of Ender - you can't trust the authorities.  In this book, the authorities can't be trusted.  Demosthenes and Locke undermine authority, and Ender grates against the way he is used by the authorities. <br />There is a religious element to the book, albeit a subdued element. It appears that at the time of the story, religion has either been outlawed or done away with.  Ender's mother secretly prayed, and if memory serves me correctly, may have even had the kids baptized or dedicated as small children.  Rather than having faith, Ender is an object of faith in this book. In that sense, he is a kind of Christ figure, but only in a loose sense.  He is the savior of the world.  And, in fact, at the end of the book, he becomes the founder of a new religion. There is even a place in the book where, when wrestling with deeds he has done, he confesses to a real love for his enemies, which is a very Christian theme. At the end of the book, he finds that he is unable to return to earth, and goes off to colonize another world - his kingdom is &quot;not of this earth,&quot; again a very Christian theme.   <br />I admit these religious elements are only there in a loose sense, I am not arguing that Orson Scott Card was operating from any Christian or religous presuppositions, but it is still fascinating to me to see potential connections. <br />The story has a great and unexpected ending - I wouldn't have expected it.  Overall, its an enjoyable book - probably good enough to make me want to read the next one.  Who knows, maybe I'll become a sci-fi aficionado.	2004-04-09

He has an exercise in chapter 1 on managing your relationships where he walks you through all the many disconnected and fragmented relationships we have in our lives. By the time you add your spouse, your extended family, spouse's extended family, your work relationships, your spouse's work relationships, your children and their relationships at school and extracurricular activities, your hobbies, your church involvement and a host of other relationships, most of us have dozens of disconnected and fragmented relationships. The problem is that none of these relationships intersect with each other, so we are pulled in all different directions. This helps explain alot of our frustration in life. We are built for community, but because we are so fragmented, it is impossible to develop deep community in any area of our lives. <br />Having set up the problem, he spends the book trying to solve it. Frankly, most people will see his solutions as undoable at first glance. However, I would highly recommend that you not write his suggestions off as undoable. A friend of mine says that there is a predictable pattern whenever we are given new information. First we reject, it then we consider it, then we embrace it. If you read this book and automatically reject it, please go back and at least consider it, and see if you can't embrace atleast some of what he says. <br />One of the keys to &quot;Making Room for Life&quot; is to live life according to the Hebrew Day Planner, which basically follows the clock set down for us in Genesis 1. We work during the day, and relate and sleep during the night. Because we moderns are so work-obsessed we work so much at night that we never have time to relate to one another. He offers some helpful suggestions for those who travel, or have shift work, on how to do this. <br />He also addresses the need for consolidating our relationships - he suggests that we recover the idea of neighborhood - where we spend lots of time working and playing close to home. This will enable us to build relationships with our neighbors. He cites some studies that show that the automobile is the number one detractor from community. The more you drive, the less you can build community. He issues a clarion call to cut down all the driving and going. <br />I also like his emphasis on the dinner table. The dinner table is where community is built in the family and amongst our neighbors. He suggests that we do whatever it takes to have dinner together with your family, or those who are in your community, every night. This is where conversation skills are built, this is where you get to know one another, this is where discipleship takes place. <br />There are a few gaps in the logic here. I find his vision for life very desirable. However, he doesn't prove that it is biblically mandated. To say that Genesis 1 shows that God set up this day/night structure does not prove once and for all that no work should be done at night. However, I think he makes the case that this is a desirable situation. I would like to see a little more exegetical work with some biblical texts in order to strengthen his case. Intuitively, I think he is on to something here, but I think he can shore up his case with some extra biblical data. <br />All in all, a book well worth reading and seeking to apply - I recommend it highly	2004-03-28
US	49043469	R25LMM0NGLAWSR	0785263454	807583202	Hard to Believe: The High Cost and Infinite Value of Following Jesus	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Not his best, but still a necessary reminder	I've read a lot of MacArthur's stuff through the years, so as I read this I am comparing it to other things he has written.  In that regard, I would have given this a four star rating because I don't think it is up to the standards he has set in &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus.&quot; Also the basic themes of this book and several others are covered in &quot;Our Sufficiency in Christ.&quot;  In my mind, &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus&quot; is MacArthur's magnum opus, and everything after that (&quot;Faith Works,&quot; &quot;Ashamed of the Gospel,&quot; &quot;Reckless Faith,&quot; and now this book) are postcripts and reinforcements of that one. <br />Also, I am not the biggest fan of transcribed sermons, which I think this is. It seems to me that different communication styles are used in speaking and writing.  &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus&quot; seemed to have been written before it was preached and it seemed to me to pack more punch.  But these are picayune comments reflecting my own idiosyncrasies. <br />Instead of giving it a four star I have given it a five star because the message is still crucial in our day of continued easy-believism.  If someone is new to MacArthur I would recommend &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus,&quot; but if this book fell into their lap first I would still say there is much to chew on. The message is vital - the Word of God has never changed, following Jesus means denying oneself and taking up a cross - there is no salvation apart from these things - it is now as it was in the beginning.  As before, MacArthur illustrates the shallow gospel that is often preached in our day, and the great majority of spurious conversions that result. <br />So, by all means, read &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus,&quot; but if you get this one first you won't go wrong.	2004-03-25
US	49043469	RR0IB8PY4QYU5	0801012600	561299527	Prophetic Untimeliness: A Challenge to the Idol of Relevance	Books	5	62	64	N	N	Timely!	This book has an interesting way of making its point. The flaps and back jacket of the book advertise this as a critique of the modern church's mad rush to be relevant.  However, he begins with an interesting description of our slavery to time - he calls watches &quot;the gods on our wrists.&quot;  This obsession with time has translated itself into an obsession with being &quot;timely,&quot; i.e. current and up to date and relevant to the culture around us.  And the downside is that in our obsession to be relevant, we have become irrelevant. He says this: <br />&quot;After two hundred years of earnest dedication to reinventing the faith and the church and to being more relevant in the world, we are confronted with an embarassing fact: Never have Christians pursued relevance more strenuously; never have Christians been more irrelevant.&quot;<br />He is correct - even in this era of the megachurch, where the advocates of relevance champion their methods because of the size of their churches, the fact of the matter is that the church is, and has been, losing its saltiness.  Most church growth is the result of professing Christians transferring churches. Also, because of the watered down &quot;relevant&quot; gospel that is preached in our day, most of those who profess faith probably don't possess it. <br />Guiness makes a case, and I think a good case, that true progress doesn't come from accomodating to the culture, but through resisting the culture.  He quotes C. S. Lewis who says that &quot;progress is made only into resisting material.&quot; <br />Among other things he points out that our quest for relevance is fueled by our fascination with futurism.  We are always trying to construct a church for the next generation.  However, as Orwell says &quot;futurism is the major mental disease of our time.&quot; Guiness points out that futurism is &quot;a quack science, it picks up current trends, projects them into the future, and then pretends that results are predictions.&quot; <br />In fact, history is a better guide to our future than relying on the study of current trends.  History gives a broader understanding of humanity than does science, so it behooves us to pay greater attention the past than to the current.<br />It has often been said, and Guiness reiterates it here, that the only way to be always timely, is to always focus on the eternal.  One of the things I have noticed about those on the mad quest for relevance is that they are constantly having to re-invent themselves with every changing wind of the culture. It seems to me that this would wear you out.  It also seems to me to be patently obvious from Scripture, that this world is hostile to the things of Christ - culture is not neutral.  Therefore, trying to stay current with the culture may mean we are accomodating our persecutors. As John MacArthur said in a recent sermon - &quot;unbelievers have become the number one church consultants in our world today.&quot;  Or, as Guiness quoted in a prior book &quot;He who sups with the devil had better use a long spoon.&quot; <br />I can't recommend this book too highly.  Guiness is not calling for irrelevance, he is just saying that the gospel is eternally relevant, it doesn't have to be &quot;made relevant.&quot;  The Biblical view is that the gospel evaluates and critiques culture, it doesn't accomodate itself to culture.  This book is a welcome defense of that notion.	2004-03-25

The characters are well-developed, the plots are good and there are many interesting sub-plots.  My only gripe is that the first two get started a little slowly, but if you hang in there for the first 50-75 pages then the action gets going well. <br />The Mystic Rose does the best job of the three in grabbing your attention at the beginning and holding it.  Within the first few pages an event happens that sets the tone for the rest of the book.  The heroine, Caitriona sets off on a quest to avenge her father's murder and capture Christendom's most sacred relic. In fact, capturing Christendom's most sacred relic is integral to her plan for revenge.  This sets up a dicey moral dilemma that is resolved nicely at the end.  <br />I find things like this moral dilemma to be one of Lawhead's strengths.  In so much Christian fiction the heroes are cookie cutter Christians who seem to rise above all of the sins and temptations of the common man.  Lawhead's heroes, and Caitriona in particular are very earthy, and very sinful people.  The upshot of this is that he tells a story that leads one to believe that God, in his mercy, is the real hero of the story, not the protagonist of the book. <br />At the end of this story, Caitriona is less conquerer and more conquered by the love and mercy of God.  This is a very gospel based story line. <br />All in all, the entire series is a worthwhile read.	2003-11-20

It's a subjective thing - the Iron Lance just grabbed me a little more than this one. <br />Howver, this is still a pretty decent book, worth reading.  The lead character is Duncan Murdosson, son of Murdo Ranulfson from the Iron Lance.  Duncan's uncle, Murdo's brother, has come home from the Holy Land where he stayed after the Great Pilgrimage.  He has harrowing tales of life in the Holy Land, but also plants in Duncan the seed of knowledge of the existence of the the Black Rood, a piece of the cross of Christ.  After enduring a great tragedy, and against the will of his father, Duncan goes on a quest for the Black Rood.  This quest will take him on a long journey through many lands and adventures and much intrigue. Along the way he will find the object of his quest, as well as love and restoration to the True Path. <br />This book is written in an interesting style.  Most of it is written in first person narrative with Duncan as the narrator, writing a story of his travels while in prison awaiting execution as the hands of Muslims.  He is writing this for the sake of his daughter, whom he expects never to see again.  One of the high spots of the book is the tale of his deliverance from prison. <br />So, for a fun read I recommend this. It's not the greatest book you will ever read, but it enjoyable nonetheless.	2003-11-17

It's the story of how a supervisor at a financial institution brings about great changes in one of the company's worst departments.  This change is brought about as it uses the philosophy of the world famous Pike Place Fish Market. <br />This book is a story, not a straight dicactic tome. That may be one reason that this book and the whole \\"Fish\\" franchise is succeeding.  It is built on stories - real and fictional - of people and companies who have made great changes using the Fish philosophy.  The \\"Fish\\" message is simple - choose your attitude, play or have fun at work, make someone's day, and be totally present wherever you are.  This is not deep stuff, but conscientiously following these steps can make a big change in the way you work and live. <br />As regards choosing your attitude, the Fish people remind us that we cannot always choose our work, but we can choose our attitude toward work.  The message here is of personal responsibility.  As regards play, this book reminds us that it is ok to have fun at work.  In fact fun is integral to work - people who are basically happy and enjoy what they do will be far more productive.  The message of making someone's day simply resonates with the Biblical imperatives of servanthood.  We exist to serve others and this servant attitude can permeate our work lives and make a difference.  The final step, of being present wherever you are reminds us all to engage the people and surroundings we find ourselves in at any moment.  Rather than being pre-occupied with someone or something else, we need to focus on those around us. <br />The story sometimes is a little contrived, but for the most part it makes the point well in an enjoyable fashion.  As one who is a stranger to the Pikes Place fish market I would like to have heard a little more of its history.  If that is not in one of the follow-up books to this then it would be good as a forward or afterward in future editions of this book. <br />All in all, it's a quick read, worth a little of your time.	2003-10-30

This is the second book of his I have read - I missed the books surrounding Arthur and others he wrote earlier in his career.  I read his novel about Patrick last year and it was pretty good, but it didn't make me a committed fan of his.  After reading this one I am much more of a fan. <br />The story centers around the Crusade of the late 1000's and 1100's.  The central character is Murdo Ranulfson, who wants to join the crusade but is too young.  His father and brothers go on the crusade but he is unable to and it grates on his terribly.  While his father and brothers are gone, his family is the victim of the treachery of some unscrupulous churchmen, and they lose their estate.  This sets Murdo on a course of action where he journeys to the Holy Land to try to find his father, in order to bring him back to claim his lands. <br />On this journey to and from the Holy Land, Murdo grows from a precocious boy into a man of strength and character.  As he makes his way across the sea and to his father he has many adventures which shape his character.  He is befriended by Celtic monks who help guide and care for him and who show him the way of the True Path.  <br />There are many reasons I liked this story - this is a \\"Christian\\" book by a \\"Christian author\\" with many Christian themes.  But, the characters are not your stereotypical characters that are found in so much Christian fiction.  There is a wonderful conversion scene involving Murdo but it is done in a very believable way.  We see Murdo's struggles along the way, and he doesn't become a saint nor does this conversion scene wipe away all of his troubles.  Instead, a very real and human person struggles along in his faith in a very harsh and brutal time of history. <br />Speaking of harsh and brutal, there are some scenes of pretty explicit violence.  I usually don't get emotionally affected, but in one scene in Jerusalem the brutality took my breath away. This is a vivid picture of man's inhumanity to man, and it is all the more stark in view of the fact that much of this is committed in the name of Christ. <br />Lawhead doesn't really theorize on the morality of the crusades - he simply tells the story.  To my mind, the story shows the futility of the crusades and the sinfulness of the whole project.  But the real story in this is the transformation of Murdo.	2003-10-30
US	49043469	RQ8W6C08DCQO5	0060694424	860874204	The Spirit of the Disciplines: Understanding How God Changes Lives	Books	4	83	87	N	N	Good, thought provoking look at one aspect of sanctification	In the doctrine of sanctification, or Christian growth, it is customary to distinguish between God's role and man's role.  Spirit of the Disciplines is focused exclusively on man's role in sanctification, or his own spiritual growth.  As long as you keep that in mind and read from that perspective, this book is dynamite.  However, it is useful to point out that this book is not the last word in Christian growth, or sanctification, simply because it does not deal with God's role in our sanctification. <br />For study on God's role in sanctification you need to look to books like \\"Transforming Grace,\\" by Jerry Bridges, or \\"Holiness by Grace,\\" by Brian Chappel.  Both books do an excellent job of bringing out the fact that God's grace is the thing that enables a man to engage in spiritual disciplines.  Also, Jerry Bridges book \\"The Discipline of Grace,\\" is probably the best book dealing with both God's role and man's role. <br />I give these commercials for other books simply to prevent the reader from thinking that Willard's book is the whole story on sanctification.  If this is the only, or the main book that you read, frustration is inevitable, simply because Willard does not point you back to the source of our sanctification, or the source of our ability to practice spiritual disciplines, which is the grace of God. <br />Having said all of that, I heartily recommend the book.  I think the most useful thing that Willard said was his comparison of the Christian life to athletics.  He has a great illustration of how kids will idolize a major league baseball player (this illustration will work for any sport).  They will copy his stance, his swing, his position in the batter's box (I'm thinking of Joe Morgan of the Cincinnati Reds and his famous double elbow pump as the pitch was being thrown), and any number of his mannerisms.  However, they will never be able to perform like their idol unless they enter into the same kind of life of their idol.  The star didn't get tobe a star by performing that way on the spot.  He adopted an entire style of life that enables him to perform the way he does on the field.  He adopts a certain exercise, diet, and practice regimen that enables him to perform the way he wants to on gameday. <br />So it is with the Christian - we can not behave \\"Christianly\\" on the spot, at a time of crisis, unless we have conformed our entire life to the pattern of Christ.  We cannot turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, be merciful, etc., at a time of crisis unless all of our life, before the crisis has been devoted to following Christ.  Willard gives Peter as the example of this.  When Peter denied Jesus three times, it was not because Peter did not love Christ, for he did.  It was not because Jesus had not warned him, for He did.  Peter denied Christ because the habitual pattern of his life till that point was one of saving his own skin.   Peter needed to develop new habits and a new way of life.  I think that in this example Willard neglects the role of the spirit in Peter's transformation, but the point is well taken.  We who are accustomed to self-indulgence, must often learn self-denial through a long period of training. <br />This is where the spiritual disciplines come in - it is through the practice of spiritual disciplines that we become like Christ.  Most of the book is a kind of philosophy, or apology for the spiritual disciplines, rather than an explanation of the disciplines themselves. He only spends one short chapter on the disciplines themselves.  The bulk of the book is concerned with persuading you and me why we need the disciplines. <br />In doing so He does make the disciplines seem attractive rather than restrictive.  This is one of the great strengths of the book.  He shows that disciplines don't restrict freedom, they enable it.  Disciplines are not harsh, punitive things, but are the means of knowing and becoming like Christ.  In large part, he makes an apology for Christian asceticism.He does a good job of distinguishing biblical asceticism from many of its historical abuses.   As someone from the Reformed tradition I have always looked at asceticism as a dirty word, but Willard's take on it is balanced and biblical. <br />Willard's concern is to show that salvation is unto a new way of life, not merely unto heaven.  He shows that the church has pretty much failed in helping people live for Christ on this earth because we have been so focused on getting them to heaven.  This is a good, well taken point.  But, this leads to what I think is a very unfortunate statement in the chapter \\"History and the Meaning of the Disciplines\\" in the sub-section called \\"The Continuing Error.\\"  He says that we have replaced salvation, which he defines as a new way of life, with one of its effects, or components, which is forgiveness of sins.  This is a glaring error, since salvation is at its essence the forgiveness of sins.  In fact, the new way of life is an effect of salvation, or the forgiveness of sins, not vice versa.  Willard's statement is pure Romanism, or works righteousness.  Because of his soundness in other areas I choose to believe that this was either carelessness in wording or that I may not fully understand what he is getting at here.  Still, though it is one sentence, it is crucial in the scheme of things.  It is forgiveness of sins that makes possible all that Willard talks about in this book in the realm of spiritual disciplines. <br />All in all I would say this is a book that should be read by the Christian as long as you balance it with some of the other books I mentioned.  Willard's writing style is dense, he packs a lot of content into a few words.  This is meaty stuff and well worth the effort.	2003-10-30

He says that as we do this we will have to have a genuine love for those we meet, while at the same time holding firm to our commitments to Christ. In doing so, he says that we will often seem too Christian to those outside of Christ.  Because of our commitment to Christ, we will rub many outside of Christ the wrong way.  On the other hand, to many Christians we will seem too pagan.  Many Christians see the non-Christian world as something to be avoided.  We cluster and cloister in our closed Christian communities and never venture out for fear of contaminating ourselves.  If a Christians genuinely loves the people outside of the world, he will seem too pagan to many Christians.  They will think he must be compromising his faith. <br />The first nine chapters of the book deal with resolving the tensions involved in this too Christian/too pagan motif.  The rest of the book deals with practical advice for entering the world for Christ. <br />From chapter 10 on the chapters are short pieces of advice.  For instance, he spends two chapters on exhorting us to experience and live the gospel as the foundation for entering the world of the non-Christian.  He then encourages us to learn how to see, think and feel Christianly.  And he follows this up with exhortations to see the movies, read the books and listen to the music the world is listening to. <br />All of this is done from the perspective of being able to relate to the world.  What is absent here is critical engagement with the world.  For instance, his encouragement is to use movies as a kind of window into the worldview of non-Christians. He doesn't encourage us to critically interact with the worldviews of the movies themselves. This is not to say that he offers a blanket commendation of non-Christian worldviews.  On the contrary, part of the reason we read the books, see the movies etc., is to discern the errors and give a proper Christian response. So, what he is basically doing is saying that we engage these things first to understand and build bridges, not to go on the defensive or the attack. <br />This book is written in a popular style. I would not call it meaty in the sense that he doesn't delve deeply into philosophical or theological issues.  But, maybe that can be considered a strength - this book doesn't encourage one to sit comfortably in an ivory tower, but to get out into the highways and byways of life.	2003-08-06

She says this: &quot;Jeffy Berryman has taken an evangelical preacher, and turned him into the most unexpected thing: a human being.&quot; <br />As an &quot;evangelical preacher,&quot; who is all too human I had to read it and I am glad I did.  It has immediately jumped into the upper echelon of my favorite novels.  <br />This is a story of a preacher and a church.  It is mostly about the preacher, but it gives a good glimpse into the life of a small town church.  Churches can be places of amazing grace, and there are some incidents depicted in this book that vividly portray this amazing grace.  Churches can also be places of unimaginable cruelty, and this book gives some realistic pictures of some of the hurts that happen in a church. <br />But the main story is about the preacher. Cyrus Manning is a study in paradoxes, pardoxes that most preachers can understand.  He is desperately in love with Jesus and desperately wants to experience Him, yet most often Jesus feels far away. He longs to be holy, while at the same time he wrestles with longings to lust after everything in a skirt.  He loves his wife deeply yet has a very difficult time communicating with her.  He loves his children, yet struggles with how to raise them.  And, he loves his church very much, yet at times hates what the church does to him. <br />Many pastors will read this book and relate to it.  They will understand the struggles that Cyrus goes through.  Many church members will read this and appreciate the struggles of their pastors like never before. <br />I predict some will hate this book.  Many pastors think they are beyond the wandering eye, the vengeful thoughts, or an occasional outburst of profanity.  To them, Cyrus will be an example of a man who is double-minded and unfit for service in the kingdom. <br />Others, who are church members will hate the book also because Cyrus definitely doesn't fit their idea of what a pastor should be.  Cyrus is certainly not on anyone's pedestal.  Most folks want a pastor who has his act together and it is obvious as you read this book that Cyrus has many struggles.  <br />I am not suggesting that Cyrus is a model to which modern pastors should seek to attain, I am saying that he is a model of what many of us are.  Many of us have similar struggles and we desperately need Jesus the way that Cyrus does.  In that sense, this book may help validate the struggles of many in the ministry. <br />There are plenty of charlatans out there, and it is tempting to assume that all pastors are quacks, based on the examples of a few.  The fact is that most pastors are trying their best to follow Jesus and shepherd the flock.  Sometimes we do well and often we fail miserably. Cyrus gives a good example of a pastor who tries his best, fails miserably, yet still finds God in the midst of his failures. <br />The great thing about this book is that it shows that there is something greater than ministerial success - knowing Jesus. Sometimes we need to fail in our ministry to succeed in knowing Jesus.	2003-08-06
US	49043469	R6C0PC6OUKFFJ	1576732304	168287793	Wisdom Hunter	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Good expose' of extreme fundamentalism	The protagonist of this book, Pastor Jason Faircloth, was everyone's worst nightmare as a pastor.  He fit the caricature of the arrogant, self-absorbed, uncaring, unfeeling fundamentalist pastor that we often hear about.  He was one who felt that he knew the Bible well, he knew God's will, he was called by God and as such, he was unassailable.  He ruled his church and his family with an iron fist.  This worked well in the church - his church was able to grow.  The mindless people who followed him accepted and appreciated his demagogery, but this didn't go over too well in his family.  I'll stop there so as not to tell the whole story, except to say that he ends up losing his family. <br />This loss of family forces a crisis in his life - he re-examines his faith and nearly abandons it.  What he ends up abandoning is his extreme fundamentalism.  What he ends up embracing is a faith that is more relational and compassionate, less structured in terms of theology and less denominationally oriented.  He completely abandons anything that smacks of tradition in favor of what seems to be a pure biblical faith. <br />This pure biblical faith is lived out in the lives of the pastor and members of a church he joins in Norway.  It is there that he is exposed to what he perceives to be true and pure Christianity. <br />The backdrop for his search for an authentic faith is his search for a granddaughter he has never met, and his search for a stunning Norwegian blonde he meets on an airplane while searching for his granddaughter.  Along the way he makes stops in London, Cyprus, Norway and New York City. The book has a very poignant ending that is worth waiting for. <br />All in all it is a very enjoyable and fast paced book.  It is hard to put down.  It grabs your attention at the beginning like a good fiction work should and does a good job of holding it. <br />The book's value is in showing the dark side of extreme fundamentalism.  I use the adjective \\"extreme\\" here because notall fundamentalists are as extreme as Jason Faircloth was.  However, I have been around a few of the extreme fundamentalists and know enough to know that some are pretty close to Jason Faircloth.  <br />However, even though most fundamentalists are not as bad as Jason Faircloth, most share one important similarity - the focus on externals.  Fundamentalism started as a good and proper doctrinal reaction to modernism but in its extreme forms it has descended into an externally based version of Christianity where one's spirituality is measured in terms of what they do or don't do.  Although most real life people will never experience the extremes that we see in Jason's family, this story does do a good job of showing the impossibility of living by legalistic externals. <br />What is missing in the life of Jason Faircloth is grace, and this is where the book has value for those who are caught up in fundamentalism.  <br />While this book tells a good story of the dangers of extreme fundamentalism there are some caveats that should be mentioned.  First of all, if you are not a fundamentalist, please don't assume that all fundamentalists are like Jason Faircloth and the people in his church.  Most fundamentalists are sincere Christians seeking to be faithful to Christ as best they can.  They may err on the side of legalism from time to time but most folks are sincerely seeking Christ. <br />Also, in his search for authentic Christianity Jason throws off everything that smacks of tradition.  It is true that traditionalism can be as binding and deadly as extreme fundamentalism, but a rejection of all tradition is as dangerous as becoming a flaming traditionalist.  Those who reject tradition usually do so out of a desire to find pure Christianity and they assume that they can find it on their own with just their Bible and the Holy Spirit.  What they fail to realize is that the Holy Spirit didn't begin speaking when they became a Christian, He has been speaking and teaching the bride of Christ for thousands of years, and it won't hurt to listen to the voices of Christians who have gone before.  <br />Also, there is a subtle downplaying of the importance of preaching in this book.  It is subtle - the author contrasts churches which are mere preaching stations with churches that are alive with what I would call body life.  This is a false dichotomy - the preaching of the Word of God is central in any church and it can foster body life, rather than hinder it. <br />I have two favorite quotes from the book - at one point, Jason's mentor says this: <br />\\"If Christianity present in a country for a long time, and becomes tightly intertwined with the culture, is it possible that Christianity in that country could become more defined by the culture's qualities than by the actual teachings of the Bible.\\" <P...<br />Overall, this is a good book - if you keep the caveats I mentioned in mind this book can help you see any legalistic tendencies in yourself and follow Jesus more fully.	2003-08-06
US	49043469	RJW8N8M9PJOHJ	0802800432	218523585	Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview	Books	5	45	48	N	N	A good introduction to worldview thinking	The subtitle of this book is \\"Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview,\\" and as the book develops, the author clearly aligns himself with the Dutch Reformed school of thought.  This school of thought is best represented by Abraham Kuyper and there is a real sense in which this book can be viewed as an introduction to Kuyperian thinking. <br />Wolters begins the book by defining what a worldview is.  He distinguishes \\"worldview\\" from the academic disciplines of theology and philosophy.  He says that one may need specialized education to engage in theology and philosophy, but a worldview is something that everyone has, regardless of education.  He defines a worldview as \\"the comprehensive framework of one's basic beliefs about things.\\" <br />He goes on to say that a Biblical worldview is to understand the world through the biblical lenses of creation, fall, and redemption.  Chuck Colson's book \\"How Now Shall We Live,\\" takes the same approach.  <br />What is unique about Wolters book, and this is a theme that runs throughout, is his distinction between structure and direction.  Structure refers to the way something was created. In other words, everything has a structure - the family, government, labor, etc., all have a structure given to them.  Direction refers to their movement toward or away from God. <br />He shows that many Christians tend to reject the structure of a thing, when they should be dealing with direction.  For instance, he speaks of human sexuality.  Many Christians view sex in a negative light.  However, sexuality has a biblical structure, i.e. it was created by God for a purpose and is to be pursued according to that purpose.  To reject sexuality out of hand is to reject God's created order, or structure.  It is the direction of human sexuality that we are to engage, not the structure.  We are to seek to redeem it, pointing it in a godward direction. <br />Wolters goes on to develop these themes through looking at how the fall affected the created order (structure) and how redemption affects it.  Redemption is concerned with reversing the effects of the fall.  Because the scope of redemption is as wide as the scope of the fall, there is nothing in all of creation that is irredeemable. <br />All of this leads up to an explanation of the Kuyperian notion of sphere sovereignty - which states that no societal institution is subordinate to any other.  In other words, the church is not subordinate to the state, nor vice versa.  This applies to all institutions - family, education, etc..  If I read him right each institution has a created structure and though they are not subordinate to one another, they are subordinate to God's laws.  Hence, all can and must be redeemed - i.e. put in a godward direction. <br />I enjoyed the book - there is a lot of meat in a few pages.  It has motivated me to study Kuyper and his disciples more closely. I am not sure that I am completed persuaded on the sphere sovereignty notion yet, but regardless, this book is provocative and well worth a read.	2003-08-05

I hope that no one avoids it because of the title.  If you read between the lines you can see that he is not denying the biblical doctrine of the eternal state.  In fact, I thought that another way of titling the book could have been &quot;Disembodied existence somewhere in an ethereal third dimension is not my destiny.&quot; <br />The view that many Christians have is that, after this life, our souls go to heaven and we walk streets of gold, wearing white robes and singing hymns for eternity.  What Marshall does is show that our eternal destiny may in fact look a bit more like our current earthly existence than we realize.  <br />Marshall correctly brings out the biblical teaching that the created order is basically good, and therefore it can be embraced.  Sin is not the essence of the creation, sin is an imposter.  <br />Because many Christians have wrongly interpreted Biblical passages on the world and worldliness we have adopted an attitude that sees this world as something evil at worst, or unnecessary at best.  Either way, this world and this earth and this creation are to be avoided or endured until the time when we will be freed from all of it. <br />However, Marshall shows very well that sin is to be removed from the creation, the creation itself is not destined to perish.  He demonstrates that this creation is destined for renewal, not eradication. Eternity will be spent in a new heavens and a new earth. <br />Such a view has implications for how we live now.  Our work, our rest, our play, our culture, our politics, and all human activity has value.  We are to embrace our earthly callings.  He makes the comment that all honest work is pleasing to God.  Paul tells us - wheter we eat or drink, do all to the glory of God. <br />All of life can be and should be done to the glory of God. <br />One weakness of the book is that he does go overboard on showing that this earth is our home.  I once hada professor who said that when a ship is listing badly to the right, you don't jump up and down in the center to get it straightened out.  You jump up and down on the left.  I think this is what Marshall has done here - he has seen how the church has overdone it on the otherworldliness and is trying to get us back on course about our responsibilities in the here and now.  As such, he doesn't deal adequately with the verses that speak of our identity as pilgrims, strangers, aliens, etc.. <br />With this minor weakness I still have no problem giving the book 5 stars. It is a beneficial and necessary read for Christians.	2003-08-04

For instance I just read Waldron's book - The End Times Made Simple.  It's a terrific book, but this book by Riddlebarger is far more comprehensive.  Also, Hoekema's book - The Bible and the Future - has long been a standard amil textbook, but this one is more current.  Here Riddlebarger is able to speak to more current issues like the Left Behind phenomena and postmillennialism.  So, though those others are not inferior, this book moves to the top of my list simply because of its comprehensive and current nature. <br />What Riddlebarger does real well is to ground amillennialism in the promise-fulfillment structure of the Bible. The Old Testament deals with the promise of the coming kingdom and the new deals with the fulfillment.  Of the four main millennial views, amillennialism does the best job of accounting for the New Testament emphasis on fulfillment. <br />One other reviewer mentioned that he wished Riddlebarger would have dealt more with the Progressive Dispensationalism than he does.  This reviewer mentioned that the Lahaye/Walvoord school of dispensationalism has been thoroughly dismantled by other books.  I agree with this, with a caveat.  In academic circles it seems like the Walvoord school is losing ground or has just about been annihilated, but this is still the dominant view in the pews.  I understand that Progressive Dispensationalism is making its way through the academic ranks but it hasn't made it to the streets yet.  The man on the street gets his dispensationalism straight from Left Behind.  So, as a pastor I appreciate Riddlebarger giving me one more tool to deal with in that regard. <br />I do hope that books like this will somehow find their way onto the shelves of Christian bookstores in our nation.  Unfortunately I am not optimistic - books like this are not quick and easy reads.  It is tightly argued and packed with Scripture (I might add that the Scripture is always understood in context). It also seeks to relate the doctrine of the end times to the whole of Scripture and the whole of theology.  And frankly, this book and this view is not very sensational.  Left Behind is a far easier and quicker way to get your eschatology.  But, if Christians would take the time to read books like this alot of the end times confusion that plagues us would be ameliorated.  And, we would all have our attention focused on worshipping Christ our redeemer, instead of trying to construct charts and timelines.	2003-07-31

If you can get the amount you way-overpaid for such a small book and if you don't have the time to read a more in-depth treatment of the subject this is a good book to read on spiritual warfare.<br />I mention the high price because it is one of the new genre of itty bitty books that has hit the shelves ever since the Prayer of Jabez. All of these books are small and are over-priced. However, for those who have limited time some of these books (especially C. J. Mahaney's book on the Cross) are well worth reading.<br />Pricing aside, this book seeks to counter the modern deliverance model of spiritual warfare with the biblical discipleship model of spiritual warfare.  To do this, Hanegraaff tells a few stories of some of the well known fakes and frauds in the deliverance industry and then turns his attention to exegeting the spiritual armor of Ephesians 6.<br />As regards the spiritual fakes and frauds he points out that modern deliverance warfare takes its cues from dubious movies and books like the Exorcist and Hostage to the Devil by Malachi Martin.  He also addresses the fabrications of people like John Todd, Mike Warnke and Loren Cunningham.  Although all three were found to be frauds they got the deliverance train moving with enough momentum that the movement has been able to sustain itself without them.<br />Hanegraaff correctly points out that the clearest passage in the Bible dealing with spiritual warfare - Ephesians 6 - does not follow the deliverance model.  In this biblical model one does not address Satan and demons, one addresses God and one's walk with God.  He makes the point that the deliverance model of spiritual warfare dovetails nicely with modern irresponsibility.  The great thing about the deliverance model is that you are not responsible for your own sin - you can plead the Flip Wilson line - \\"the devil made me do it.\\"  Ephesians 6, on the contrary makes the individual responsible for his actions, not the devil.<br />There are some things I wish he had said in his discussion about the pieces of armor, but with it being such a short book, its hard to fault him for that.  You can only say so much in such a short space. Specifically I would have liked to seen the book give greater emphasis to the fact that all of the pieces of armor are things we have in Christ, they are not things we try to achieve.  In other words, we rest in Christ's righteousness, we don't try to be righteousness. This is touched on, I just would have liked to seen it emphasized more.<br />Overall, not a bad book for such a short book.6, on the contrary makes the individual responsible for his actions, not the devil. <br />There are some things I wish he had said in his discussion about the pieces of armor, but with it being such a short book, its hard to fault him for that.

I have to add the caveat that understanding the end times will never be as simple as many other biblical doctrines.  However, in this book, Waldron shows that the end times don't have to be as hard to understand as we tend to make them. <br />He begins the book with some simple principles of interpretation that are very helpful.  When reading the bible we should read the clear before the difficult, the literal before the figurative and the general before the detailed.  Such simple advice will go miles in helping us understand prophecy.  For the most part, people who want to understand the end times run straight to the books of Daniel and Revelation, two of the mmore difficult, figurative and detailed books in the bible.  Although he didn't state it this way, one of the strengths of the amillennial position that Waldron espouses is its emphasis on interpreting the prophetic books in light of the rest of the bible, rather than the other way around.  Waldron's three simple principles of interpretation help the reader do this. The bible is full of prophetic material, which, if read first will give the student of bible prophecy a trajetory for reading books like Daniel and Revelation. <br />From there, Waldron goes on to show the two-age view of world history and it is at this point that he shows the beautiful simplicity of God's prophetic plan.  He spends a good deal of time describing this and comparing the various end-times views with this model.  His exposition of Revelation 20 is a particular strength in this regard.  In my opinion Waldron proves his case when he states that the amil view is the biblical view. <br />The latter part of the book answers many of the knotty questions surrounding prophecy such as the relationship of the church and Israel, the intermediate state, heaven, hell, eternal punishment and things like this.  In doing this he covers most of the bases on issues that come up. <br />I am thankful for this book because it is scrupulously Biblical.  It is unfortunate that those who hold the amil position are often dismissed in evangelical circles.  Books like this one need to be widely circulated so that the church can see that the amil view (which is the dominant historic view of the church) is clearly taught in the Scriptures.  That is not to say that there are no problems or issues that can't be debated.  However, those who write amils off as &quot;non-literalists&quot; or as those who don't take the bible seriously will have to reconsider their view if they read books like this one.	2003-07-29

The author has researched a vast array of commentaries and commentators on the book of Revelation and given us a summary of four different ways of interpreting the book, straight from the mouths of proponents of the various views. <br />It is obvious that in such a work he cannot be exhaustive.  Furthermore, he doesn't really try to prove any one position but simply tries to let the advocates of the various positions state their views. <br />As a pastor I find this book valuable.  Although I obviously have more time to study the bible than most I don't have all the time in the world.  I don't have the time to wade through a dozen or more commentaries in preparing to teach on the book of Revelation.  However, I have the responsibility to teach accurately and to fairly represent different views which are found within Christendom. <br />This is where the book shows its greatest strength.  Full time scholars will wade through all of the commentaries, but pastors and bible teachers whose time is more limited can turn to this book as a reference on the differing views. <br />One of the things you will find is that there are four broad categories of approach to the book of Revelation - the historicist, preterist, futurist and idealist.  And you will also find that within those categories there are differing angles which are taken on particular passages.  This could be discouraging to some because it may make you come away thinking that the task of understanding the book of Revelation is hopeless. <br />On the other hand, maybe God has a purpose in this confusion.  I believe it was Pascal who said something along the lines of this - God did not give us the bible to tickle our intellects but to tranform our our lives.  I probably butchered the quote, but the point is that maybe God gave us Revelation in the form it is in to help us understand His greatness and our smallness.  Maybe the book of Revelation has received so many different interpretations because God doesn't want us to figure it out or become experts, He wants to humble us and reduce us to awe and wonder at His power which is so richly displayed in the book of Revelation. <br />All of this is not to say that we can or should be agnostic when it comes to interpreting the book of Revelation.  I have a definite opinion on the book and am prepared to argue it.  However, this book has tempered my argumentative spirit.  It has helped me to see where those I disagree with are coming from and shown me where those opponents have pointed out legitimate weaknesses in my own position.  Most importantly though, it helps me embrace those brothers I disagree with as we eagerly await the return of Christ.	2003-07-29

I laughed because everyone knows that the book of Revelation is anything but simple and clear.  He said he was serious and he mentioned that he had studied Revelation under Vern Poythress at Westminster Seminary and he had made it seem clear and simple. <br />At the time this book had not been published but I was able to get some tapes by Poythress, and they taught what is written in this book.  When the book came out I got it right away and I have to say that I was not disappointed in the tapes or in this book. <br />Poythress writes like a kindly, wise elder.  I say he is kind because, though he takes a position on the interpretation of the book, he is gracious to those who disagree with him.  One of the things I particularly liked about this book is his discussion of how to outline the book.  He listed a few different ways that this could be outlined, but rather than attacking various positions he affirmed that the existence of these differing views should cause us to marvel at the greatness of God in the book.  These things show that the book of Revelation is like a giant tapestry, with many colors and patterns weaving in and out.  The book is so rich that one can never tire of admiring the beauties of God in it. <br />As to his position, Poythress says that the book follows the pattern of recapitulation - it describes the same historical events over and over again using different metaphors and pictures.  So, rather than being a straight chronological description of the end time, the book of Revelation describes the second coming, and the events surrounding it, several times. <br />Poythress shows that the book of Revelation is actually comprised of several cycles of judgment.  He gives the tools for understanding how to identify these cycles and in doing so makes Revelationslightly less difficult. <br />This is the place to start in understanding the book of Revelation.	2003-07-29

(Basics of the Faith) (Basics of the Reformed Faith)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A good short overview of the Reformed tradition	Steve Smallman packs a surprisingly large amount of content into this little booklet.  He gives a very short history of the Reformed tradition, then moves on to state some of the key Reformed doctrinal positions.  A book of this size is not designed to prove these doctrinal positions, merely to state them and he does a good job. <br />Smallman discusses the Reformed views of Scripture, God's Sovereignty, the church, the covenants, the law of God, and the sacraments. I was impressed that he even gave a quick and dirty explanation of the three uses of the law.  <br />This is a good booklet to give to new members in a Reformed church.  This will let them know what the church believes.  Of course, they will need to go to other books to find the proof of these points (may I suggest Michael Scott Horton's &quot;Putting Amazing Back Into Grace&quot;), but this booklet does a great job of stating the Reformed views in a quick format.	2003-07-24

By that, I don't mean to say that this book is the last word on small groups, nor do I mean to say that it has everything you will need to maintain and grow a small group ministry. <br />However, for those churches that are contemplating beginning small groups in their churches, I can't think of a better resource.  The authors cover all the bases.  The section titles of the book are: <br />Part 1 - Making the Case for Community<BR>Part 2 - Pursuing Community in Small Groups<BR>Part 3 - Developing Leaders of Small Groups<BR>Part 4 - Leading a Church of Small Groups<br />These sections provide the rationale for small groups and the basic mechanics of launching and maintaining small groups. I particularly like the practical emphasis of the book.  It gives you help on building relationships, resolving conflict, and shepherding small groups. Among other things, it encourages you to have &quot;open&quot; groups with an &quot;empty chair&quot; to emphasize the outreach aspect of small group life. <br />It covers all aspects of leadership training - although it doesn't give you an exact curriculum it gives you a process for leadership training. The authors focus more on apprenticeship and what one could call &quot;on the job training&quot; for leadership development than classroom training. <br />The section on &quot;Leading a Church of Small Groups&quot; is especially helpful.  You don't just decide one day to &quot;do small groups.&quot; Launching takes time and is best done in steps, phasing in over time. <br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, thorough overview of what small groups can be and do in a church.	2003-07-24

However, this small volume is written more to show what a Calvinist looks like.  Another way of saying this that Ryken spends most of his time describing what effects Calvinism has on the life of the one who embraces it. <br />With that in view, this little booklet does an excellent job.  It is a welcome respite from the \\"everyone who isn't a Calvinist is an idiot\\" genre of writing that so often characterizes usCalvinists.  It has none of the combative tone that many works on Calvinism possess.  <br />Ryken shows that the one who is a true Calvinist will not be characterized by his combativeness.  The true Calvinist will be characterized by God-centeredness, humility, penitence, gratitude, and holy living among other things.  <br />This is a good litmus test for those of us who follow the Calvinistic tradition.  If our doctrine has not produced the above characteristics in us then something is missing in our theological education.	2003-07-24

Someone asked the speaker why he didn't shorten it.  He replied &quot;I didn't have the time to prepare a shorter speech.&quot;  <br />Sometimes the most nourishment is packed in the smallest container and that is how it is with this book by C. J. Mahaney.  Yes, there are much bigger books you can get on the cross of Christ but this one hits the nail on the head better than much bigger books. <br />Being short and to the point, the book gives you a good understanding of the centrality of the cross, but also how to live the cross-life daily.  Mahaney shows how the cross defeats the legalism, condemnation and subjectivism that drags Christians down.  <br />One of the best points he makes is to remind us that there are many good and excellent things in the Christian life that we can be involved in or interestd in, yet these things can distract us from focusing on the cross. We should never take our eyes off the cross. He paints a picture of the cross that is so beautiful you can't help having your eyes turned toward the one who died on the cross for His people. <br />This is one to be read and re-read.	2003-07-23

It does an excellent job of fulfilling that objective.  The author is a former skeptic who, through the influence of his wife came to faith in Christ.  So, the book is a mixture of teaching and testimony.  He teaches us what the unbeliever is thinking and illustrates it with his own life story.  He doesn't limit himself to his own story but illustrates his points with stories from many others he has known. <br />Christians often speak of the ministry of Jesus as &quot;incarnational&quot; - where He became one of us.  He became like us to save us.  Strobel's book gives some good advice for how Christians can do the same.  We often seek to evangelize without understanding our audience. <br />I would caution that this book does make sweeping generalizations.   Rather than pigeon-holing every unchurched person you meet and thinking you understand them because you have read this book, you can simply take the time to listen and get to know the person as an individual, and see where God leads you.  This would be &quot;Meeting Harry Where He Lives,&quot; and is a great application of the book. <br />One chapter stands out as particularly helpful - the chapter on living with an unchurched spouse.  Strobel understands this well because his wife came to Christ many years before he did.  His insights are valuable as he shares the sense of loss and disorientation that an unchurched spouse goes through when their mate becomes a Christian.  Christians may think that the unchurched spouse is merely hostile or hard-hearted, but in fact, the unchurched spouse may be feeling a great sense of loss as his or her mate's affections for him are transferred to Christ and the church. <br />This book is sociological, not theological.  That is it's major weakness.  It gives an excellent sociological analysis of the unchurched person and then it seeks to derive a ministry strategyfrom that sociological analysis.  The problem here is that Strobel is advocating a church that is organized around the needs of the unchurched, rather than the directives of the Bible.  While the pastor or religious leader needs to be sensitive to the sociological needs of the unchurched, he still must be directed by the Bible, and in this case the book falls short. <br />I want to be quick to point out that at no point does Strobel advocate compromising the gospel.  He is merely suggesting that we change our methods or delivery systems.  However, the Bible not only tells us what the message is, it gives us directions for our methods also.  <br />Overall, a very helpful book.  Just make sure you filter the sociological through the theological and let the theological take pre-eminence.	2003-07-22

If you want a quick and to the point rundown on grace try &quot;Transforming Grace,&quot; by Bridges, or &quot;Born Free&quot; by Steve Brown.  <br />But, if you have the time and desire to soak in the depths of the Bible's teachings on God's grace, I heartily recommend this book.  It is best taken slowly.  I think I read it too fast and will need to go back and re-read some portions of it. <br />Chapell has a great writing style.  He mixes teaching with illustration very effectively.  His illustrations range from the mundane things of everyday life to quotes from famous theologians in the Reformed and Puritan tradition. <br />The title of the book shows the theme clearly - holiness comes by the grace of God.  Too often Christians treat grace as the thing that gets them into the Christian life, and holiness as the thing that gets them through the Christian life.  The fact is that grace gets us into the Christian life and grace produces the holiness that characterizes us throughout the Christian life. <br />The author does a wonderful job of displaying the grace and mercy of God without making it a license to sin.  One of my favorite chapters was the one on mercy.  We Christians often forget God's mercy after awhile, and our daily need of it.  <br />He shows that, rather than being an excuse for sin, grace helps us live above sin.  The grace that saves us from the penalty of sin saves us from the power of sin. <br />Thanks to the Sonship ministry of World Harvest Mission and the writings of Bridges, Brown, Max Lucado and others grace is now high on the radar of many Christians.  But Chapell reminds us that grace is not just a new fad for the church, nor is it a mere reaction to more oppressive types of fundamentalism.  Grace is the path we walk throughout the Christian life.	2003-07-22

With this book Crabb hopes to start a revolution.  I am a little suspicious of anyone who actively tries to start a revolution.  It seems to me that the people God used to start revolutions in the Bible wanted anything but to start a revolution.  It seems that the main thing that qualifies someone to start a revolution is a reluctance to start said revolution. <br />Haivng said that, after revolutionaries are touched by God, they must move out.  And maybe that is what has happened here - maybe this is the fruit of years of God's preparaiton of Crabb. <br />This book has some profound insights into the ways of God with man that could revolutionize the way we relate to God.  I say \\"revolutionize\\" to say that this would change the way we think about God, pray to God and what we expect from God.  In saying that, I don't mean to say that our life will suddenly become a bed of roses. <br />Shattered Dreams would make an interesting companion book to Desiring God by John Piper.  Crabb says much the same thing that Piper says - our greatest joy is found in God, not from God.   It has been several years since I read Desiring God but my recollection is that Piper seeks to foster our satisfaction in God by motivating us to pursue our pleasure in knowing God.  Crabb, on the other hand, demonstrates how God fosters satisfaction and pleasure and passion in Him by stripping away all of the lesser pleasures of this earth. <br />IMHO the three most helpful insights that this book offers are: <br />1. The goal is that God be glorified in us, not that He be useful to us. Crabb says that we have taken the \\"Holy God of Passionate Wrath,\\" and turned Him into the \\"Helpful God of Useful Principles.\\"  One thought that occurred to me in this regard is that Crabb makes the case that what we need to repent of is our desire for God to make us feel good and give us a sense of well-being.  If this is the case, many probably need to re-examine their \\"salvation experience,\\" since many in our day come to Christ because He has been presented to them as the \\"useful God.\\"  Come to Christ - He is useful to get you out of hell and into heaven, come to Christ, He is useful to give you a happy life, etc., etc..  Could it be that the Christ that many have allegedly \\"accepted\\" is not the Christ of the Bible, and could this explain why so many who have allegedly \\"accepted\\" Christ fall away? If nothing else, this insight from Crabb should cause all who name the name of Christ to re-examine their hearts to see what kind of \\"Christ\\" they are naming. <br />2. God is committed to bringing us the greatest joy possible, however such joy is only found in Him.  Therefore, He allows, and even causes, us to have our most cherished dreams shattered in order that we will quit hoping in them and find our joy in Him. <br />3. Though we can now claim to be the bride of Christ, we live in the betrothal period of our relationship.  The wedding feast of the lamb is yet to come - the relationship has not been consummated yet. Therefore, though we are secure in our relationship with Christ we cannot and will not ever feel as close to Him on earth as we long to.  There is distance in the betrothal period that is not present once the wedding has taken place. God feels hidden from us because to a large extent He is hidden from us. <br />Also, Crabb makes some good points about how we treat people who are going through the agony of shattered dreams.  We are usually quick to accept those who are suffering as long as they utter all of the proper pious platitudes - \\"yes, my life is in a shambles but I am trusting God in the midst of this and getting better day by day, all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose, etc. etc.\\"  But we are less comfortable with those whose today's are worse than their yesterday's and who are honest about their pain and confusion - \\"my life is in a shambles right now and I don't see God anywhere in this situation, as far as I am concerned it looks like He has forsaken me.\\"  We prefer piety, even false piety, to honesty. <br />There are a couple of paragraphs on page 144 that summarize the book very nicely, I believe.<br />\\"It's hard to hear, but it is important to know that God is   not committed to supporting our ministries, to preventing our divorces, to preserving our health, to straightening out our kids, to providing a livable income, to ending famine, to protecting us from agonizing problems that generate in our souls an experience that feels like death.\\"<br />\\"We cannot count on God to arrange what happens in our lives in ways that will make us feel good.\\"<br />\\"We can count on God to patiently remove all the obstacles to our enjoyment of Him. He is committed to our joy, and we can depend on Him to give us enough of a taste of that joy and enough hope that the best is still ahead to keep us going in spite of how much pain continues to plague our hearts.\\"<br />Whether or not Crabb's insights start a large scale revolution, they can start an individual revolution as we exchange the \\"useful God\\" for the Biblical God, and this book is a good starting point.	2003-06-19

If, like me, all you knew about Patrick was that he had something to do with the Irish people, wearing green and shamrocks, then this book will introduce you to the real reasons for Patrick's fame - his bold missionary ministry to the Irish. <BR>As far as the how-to's go I think the gist of the book can be summed up in a little summmary table that Hunter gives contrasting what he believes is the Celtic Way vs. the Roman Way.  The Roman way said that a person has to believe before they can belong.  The Celtic way said that a person must belong in order to believe.  Therefore, the Roman process of evangelism was 1 - Preach the Christian messsage, 2 - Call to a decision for Christ, 3 - Invite into the fellowship of the church.  In contrast, Hunter says that the Celtic was is to 1 - Invite the unbeliever into the community, 2 - Engage them in ministry and conversation - a kind of conversational evangelism focusing on answering the questions of the unbeliever rather than pushing them along a predetermined path or presentation, and 3) Invitation to commitment to Christ and the ministry of the community.  Hunter says that, in the Celtic community, &quot;seekers&quot; often came to Christ in a matter of days or weeks as a result of participating in the life of the Christian community. <BR>Hunter suggests that our evangelistic methodology today looks more like the Roman way and that we would be well advised to adopt the Celtic way.  As evidence he cites some of his own research showing that most people who do come to Christ come to Christ along a more &quot;Celtic&quot; path - i.e., being welcomed into a group where they can hear and see the gospel lived out over time, and gradually embracing this gospel.  Hunter says the Celtic way affirms that the Christian faith is more caught than taught. <BR>If we were totake Hunter's insights seriously, many churches would have to seriously re-evaluate how they do &quot;evangelism.&quot;  If Hunter is correct, the standard confrontational approaches of evangelism, where we give the whole gospel presentation at one time and call for a decision right then and there, would need to be modified to allow some time and breathing room for the &quot;seeker&quot; to &quot;catch&quot; the gospel. <BR>If you read this book in conjunction with Richard Peace's book &quot;Conversion in the New Testament,&quot; you will find that such a &quot;Celtic&quot; methodology dovetails nicely with the way Jesus evangelized the disciples. Peace demonstrates that the book of Mark is the story of the conversion of the disciples, which took place in the context of a group, over a long period of time. This is what Hunter is advocating as the &quot;Celtic&quot; way of evangelism. <BR>There are a few places I wondered about in this book. In talking about the way the Celts presented the gospel, Hunter takes principles from Aristotle and Kierkegaard and reads them back into the Celtic way of evangelism.  This seems a little artificial to me, although there is some food for thought there.  Also, especially troubling, and this seemed to be troubling to Hunter to, is that the Celts seemed to portray Christ as one who brings fulfillment rather than the savior of sinners. This is espcially troubling because if there is no sin, there is no need for a savior.  The essence of the gospel always has been and always will be that Christ is the savior of sinners.  Finally, in their prudent zeal to contextualize the gospel to the Irish and find common ground, the Celts may have bluured the lines between contextualization and accomodation. <BR>Overall, a tremendous book, a few things need to be theologically filtered, but as far as evangelistic methodology goes there is much to learn from here.	2003-03-20

Conspiracy of Kindness was biblical, doable and practical.  That's a pretty good description for this book - it's short on theory and long on practicality.  Warren's \\"Purpose Driven Church,\\" and Pope's \\"The Prevailing Church\\" are great places to go for theory and some practical steps, but this book by Sjogren is particularly useful for small churches looking for ways to grow.  To begin with, Sjogren defines four kinds of churches - the struggling church, the ego-driven church, the launching pad church, and the pretty good church.  I think he rightly points out that many of the mega-churches of the day are ego-driven churches.  This is not to say that the pastors of those churches all have big egos, but rather that those churches are built around the particular skills and the charisma of these larger than life leaders. And, since most of us don't possess the same skills and charisma as those leaders it is going to be very hard to duplicate their sucesses. <BR>In The Perfectly Imperfect Church Sjogren focuses on one audience - the church of less than 200 - the struggling church.  This is where most churches in the U.S. are today.  He says that most of us won't make it to the level of a mega-church but most of us can have a pretty good church of 300-500 people which is active in ministry.  This book is targeted to such churches and is full of great ideas.  Some of the ideas are a little off the wall, but each pastor can filter it through his own theological grid and use what is helpful.  I particularly like his emphasis on outreach.  Throughout the book his passion for outreach comes through - this must be central to all we do and he also shows that outreach is alot easier and more doable than we thought. I like it that Sjogren also defines discipleship as doing, not studying and getting mystical.  I could go on, but suffice it to say - this book is worthyour while - it's an easy read, but it has food for thought that will keep you going for quite awhile.	2003-03-19

I bought this book because I recognized the name of the author as a seminary classmate of mine and so I ordered it as much out of curiosity as anything else.  I am happy to report that I am now an official member of the \\"couldn't put it down\\" club.  I had the luxury of reading it during the great blizzard of '03 that struck the northeast so I had a couple of days to read it while being snowed in. <BR>The book is fast paced and it grabs you immediately.  The plot brings together a wide range of elements - there is the spy/suspsense/FBI angle, the tragedy of lost love dimension, moral dilemmas, medical research and the ethical questions associated with certain types of research, and a little danger to boot.  I have read a smattering of the popular Christian fiction out there, so although I don't consider myself an expert in this genre but I have read enough to know that this book is as good or better than most of the popular Christian fiction out there.  I highly recommend it.	2003-02-21

I don't know if this one will replace it, but it certainly should be read alongside of PDC.  The two are very complementary - they deal with many of the same subjects from slightly different, though certainly not competing, angles. <br />There are many things I could point out about this book that are helpful but the list would get too long.  There are 21 chapters and each deals with a different aspect of church leadership and life, and each is valuable.  I will point out what I think three most valuable aspects of the book for me. <br />1 - The Prevailing Church idea - taking his cue from Peter's confession of Christ in Matthew 16 and Jesus' response that that gates of hell would not prevail against the church, Randy Pope argues that to &quot;prevail&quot; is at the heart of the church's identity.  He says that &quot;a prevailing church models such a dynamic spirit of worship and servanthood that she becomes a magnet for people needing help.  Such a church is a place where insincere people tend to fall away and sincere people long to belong.  And, most important, it is a place where nonbelievers find Christ and grow to spiritual maturity.  To put it another way, it's a place where the presence of God's power is demonstrated with such force that the community in which it exists is marked with an indelible spiritula imprint.&quot;  Such a sense of identity would motivate the church against any kind of maintenance, or &quot;precautious&quot; mindset, as Mr. Pope describes it. <br />2 - The importance of strategic ministry plan - I realize that some will balk at this, as if this means we are to rely on human planning at the expense of the leading of the Spirit.  However, this is not what the book portrays at all.  A strategic plan for ministry is one that is arrived at through searching the Scriptures, spending hours upon hours in prayer, and thenseeking to be obedient to the Scriptures.  In my opinion, the author does a marvelous job of dispelling the notion that planning and being led by the spirit are in conflict.  And, he does a marvelous job of showing that a strategic plan is often the missing ingredient in ministry. I came away challenged about my own tendency to work very hard to derive a sense of vision and mission, without doing the nuts and bolts work of implementation. <br />3 - Analysis of culture - chapter 16 is devoted to a &quot;Culturally Oriented Strategy,&quot; but throughout the book he gives some interesting tidbits of cultural observation.  My favorite anecdote in this regard is the story of his attempt to disciple a man in his congregation using a strategy he had used while in college.  This strategy included about 3 meetings per week and who knows how many hours.  This may have worked in college but this was a man who was working 60 or more hours per week, and had to travel alot.  Mr. Pope's point is that this is the kind of world we live in these days - many are like this man and we have to come up with discipleship strategies that will impact these worlds.  I realize that we can all say &quot;people shouldn't be so busy,&quot; and I can agree.  But the fact is that they are and we have to take them where we find them and move them to maturity. <br />There is much more to say, but I will stop now.  It's a great book for those in professional ministry and lay leadership.	2002-07-03

My wife and I use it as a \\"just before bedtime\\" devotional and have greatly benefited from it.  OK, I admit I probably benefit more than my wife because I am a Piper fan, but she hasn't complained. <br />There is a sense in which you could write one review that covers all of Piper's writings, because all of his writings are on the theme of the supremacy of God and/or Christian hedonism.  This is no different - it is a compilation of short devotional readings that apply those two themes to various topics. <br />There is no common thread in these devotions, but to me that is part of the fun of this book.  Piper is all over the map here - from marriage, to zeal, to doctrine, to reading, to abortion, to missions, to parenting, and dozens more.  I find it spiritually and intellectually challenging to open up to a page and to be called upon to think about a topic that I don't usually think about.  And, as I said, with this \\"supremacy of God/Christian hedonism\\" theme running throughout, the book helps expand one's worldview, seeing all of life as being lived for God's glory. <br />Great book - well deserving of 5 stars.	2002-07-03
US	49043469	RWKQJA4XS9T21	0877847940	50042379	The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views	Books	5	31	33	N	N	Indispensible (IMHO) for Understanding the End Times	Like most modern evangelical Christians, I was brought up in the faith to believe that the bible taught that there would be a rapture, followed by a seven year tribulation period, followed by the second coming of Christ where He would set up a millennial kingdom in Jerusalem where he would reing for 1000 years, followed by a final coming where he would usher in the eternal state with a new heavens and a new earth. <br />Back in the early 90's I was studying for ministry and I figured that someone would probably ask me my view of the end times some day, so I decided I needed to study it for myself.  So, I acquired a 28 tape set on the end times by one of the leading conservative scholars in America.  I listened to all of them, as he explained and defended the above scheme and I came away from that thinking that I would never be able to persuade someone of that position unless they were already heavily predisposed to believing it.  What I mean is that I couldn't find a rapture/tribulation, etc. in any of the Scriptures that this teacher used. <br />So, scratching my head, I did a little more research and came across this book. It opened my eyes to the fact that there were other views of the end times that were held by Christians who believed the Bible was the word of God.  I had been told in the past that the only people who don't follow the rapture/tribulation etc., scheme were people who didn't believe the Bible. <br />I won't tell you what view I adopted, other than to say that I found that all of the views had much to commend them, from a Scriptural standpoint, except the one I formerly held. <br />This book does an excellent job of letting the representatives from the various schools of thought speak for themselves, and it allows critiques in a scholarly and irenic manner.  I would urge anyone who feels strongly about their view of the end times to read this book.  It may or may not change your mind, but hopefully it will at least open your mind to some new possibilities when it comes to end times scenarios.	2002-05-31

It took a couple of years get through them but now I am sorry there aren't more.<br />I miss the kids, I miss Aslan, and I especially miss Reepicheep, the mouse - he was a true warrior and a gentleman.<br />It is hard to describe just how wonderful these books are - they helped a guy in his mid-thirties rekindle his imagination, they are funny, they are profound, and for those of us who are Christians, they give tremendous analogies to the gospel message.<br />Read them all, you won't be disappointed.	2002-05-31

The type is double spaced and I was able to read it in just a few hours, so it is a good choice for someone who is short on time but wants a fresh persective on evangelism. <br />Dreisbach basically paints a dismal picture of the church's current efforts to reach the lost.  His basic premise, as articulated by many before him, is that God cares for those who don't know Christ, and he calls Christians to go find them.  However, he points out that most churches today expect people to come to them to hear the gospel.  While this may have worked in an era when most people went to church and when Christianity was prominent in the culture, it won't work now.  Nowadays, when people are seeking guidance in spiritual matters, the church is not the place they turn to. <br />Two chapter titles sum things up very well - &quot;They Aren't Coming In,&quot; and &quot;We Aren't Going Out.&quot;  He repeats the oft told statistic that only 1 out of 10 Christians ever lead a person to Christ (I believe I got that numnber right) and then he asks what would happen if only one out of 10 married couples ever produced a child?  No wonder the number of Christians continues to diminish. <br />Another thing I liked about this was his critique of &quot;trickle down evangelism.&quot;  This is the idea that, if churches will concentrate on feeding believers, then the believers will naturally go out and share their faith with non-believers.  He says this simply isn't working and won't work.  We must become intentional in seeking to reach the lost. <br />Given the typical traditional church schedule, Christians spend 90% (or more) of the time they have available for service and ministry going to meetings with other Christians.  If we are to reach people, Dreisbach says we need to swing the percentage to the other side. <br />Overall, I liked the book.  Some will be uncomfortable with what seems to be a low view of theinstitutional church, but I think the points he makes about the need to prioritize evangelism are right on target.	2002-05-31

Hi, my name is David and I am a Calvinist (pause while the rest of the group says \\"Hi David.!\\")<br />Yes, I embraced the doctrines that have come to be known as \\"Calvinism\\" and it was not without a great struggle. I wrestled with the issues that many people wrestle with, God's sovereignty vs. man's freedom, sovereingty and the existence of evil, etc..  Some were thrilled when I embraced Calvinism and others were horrified.  One of the most common complaints that I have heard about Calvinists is that we don't care about evangelism.  There are some who aren't bothered by that charge, they figure that God is sovereign and he will bring in the elect with or without their help.  There are others who are bothered by the charge and would strenuously object to it.  But, many wrestle with the practical implications of Calvinism, specifically in the realm of evangelism.  There are those who believe that to be passionate about evangelism is to compromise God's sovereignty. <br />This book shows that the two can and do go together.  The only reason that a person should embrace what is called Calvinism is because they believe the Bible teaches it and if the Bible teaches it we must embrace it.  And, if the Bible says that Christians have the responsibility to evangelize then we must embrace this as strongly as we embrace our Calvinism. <br />Spurgeon got in trouble with Calvinists because of his passion for evangelism and he got in trouble with Arminians because of his passion for God's sovereignty.  But Spurgeon said that his goal wasn't to be a consistent Calvinist, his goal was to be consistent with the Scriptures.  If the Scriptures teach God's sovereignty, we must affirm it.  If the Scriptures teach that we must have a passion for evangelism, we must. <br />This book should be a challenge to complacent Calvinists who have rationalized away their obligation to evangelize by appealing to their views of God's sovereignty.	2002-05-31

I have studied church history in the past and am familiar with the Waldensians, whose story this is based on, but had never heard of Rora, or the hero, Joshua Gianavel. <br />One reviewer said that the characters are unbelievable, and I can see how someone would say this. So, I looked around for more on Joshua Gianavel and found accounts of his life and the story of Rora in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and Wylie's History of Protestantism.  Suffice it to say, the true Gianavel was quite a guy. <br />This story is inspirational on several levels.  It shows what one person can do against seemingly insurmountable odds and it gives a good demonstration of someone with the courage of their convictions.  <br />I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good story, as I had a very hard time putting it down.  It will also give some insight into the Waldensian movement and the Inquisition.  But I believe it especially needs to be read by those in leadership, as Gianavel  is one who truly was a great leader.	2002-05-31

This was a textbook for me in seminary.  I am in a conservative Presbyterian denomination and studied at a very conservative seminary, and this book got some interesting reviews from the students.<br />For me, it was a little difficult, since I don't have much background in sociology, but as I trudged through it I really grew to appreciate it.  Some of my other classmates loved it too, but there were several who were quite taken aback by it.  They didn't like it because Hunter didn't come out and condemn those who were on the wrong side of the culture wars.<br />But that is just the point - in this book he does not try to point out who is wrong and who is right, his object is to demonstrate why neither side is able to persuade, or prevail against the other.<br />Each side in the culture war has it's own set of presuppositions and assumptions that it speaks from.  Because of this, that which seems most persuasive to one side completely misses those on the other side, because they don't share the same presuppositions.  We are talking past one another.<br />Another problem that Hunter addresses is the issue of extremes and inflammatory rhetoric.  Hunter says that, by and large, the culture wars are being fought by people on the extreme ends of their positions.  So, the battle of the culture wars is usually fought with inflammatory rhetoric that doesn't persuade, it just angers.<br />As a sidenote I recently read a story about how communists used to train their young recruits.  This particular communist said that when a young person adopted communism the best thing they could do was immediately set them on a street corner passing out communist leaflets.  They would get attacked mercilessly, but this attack would only serve to harden and solidify the young communist in his or her beliefs.<br />I think Hunter shows this - the inflammatory rhetoric used by those on the extreme ends of the culture war debates, only serves to harden the other side in their respective positions.<br />So, if you are looking for quick answers, or a strategy to defeat your opponents, you won't find it here.  But, if you are willing to begin to at least try to understand your opponents, as well as the larger issues, this is a great place to start.positions. <br />So, if you are looking for quick answers, or a strategy to defeat your opponents, you won't find it here.

Books	4	6	8	N	N	Eye Opening - Possibly Life Changing	I first heard about this book when I was in college, before it was published.  A friend of mine had a tape of a question and answer session that John MacArthur had done somewhere and one of the questioners asked him how he responded to those who were beginning to charge him with believing in &quot;Lordship Salvation.&quot; I don't remember all that he said, but I do remember him saying, &quot;since when did believing that Jesus is Lord become bad doctrine.&quot; <br />A few years later the book came out and I gobbled it up.  MacArthur makes a strong scriptural case for the fact that when Jesus &quot;saves&quot; someone, he also changes them.  I was amazed at some of the things that some well known Christian authors and leaders had said about salvation and how they tried to defend their belief that a person can have Christ as savior without having Him as Lord. <br />MacArthur scripturally rebuts this idea.  Also, the caricatures that the opponents of Lordship Salvation have raised are off base.  MacArthur does not teach a works salvation in this book, he simply teaches that Christ is able to sanctify those whom He saves. <br />I read the original edition of this book, and I know that MacArthur updated it in this current edition.  The original edition was not without some problems, but my understanding is that he corrected and stated some of his points better in this edition.  The book &quot;Christ the Lord,&quot; edited by Michael Scott Horton, addressed some of the problems in the original edition and I believe that these have been addressed in the current edition.	2002-05-31

I find that I can always open this book and find the prayer of some godly saint from yesteryear who can express the desires of my heart better than I can.

I am making plans right now to read it to my kids (right after we get through with the Chronicles of Narnia series).  Though this book is old (published 1682) it is still one of the best descriptions of the Christian life available in either fiction or non-fiction form. The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross.  &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre.  So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more.  Then was Christian glad with a merry heart.  He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death.  Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot;  Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them.  Truly this is a book that warms the heart, rekindles our affection for Christ, and provides encouragement for us in our own journey to the Celestial City.	2001-05-08
