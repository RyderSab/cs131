If you don't like authors or comedians who can't let something drop, don't purchase either &quot;Book&quot; or &quot;Audiobook.&quot;  However, if you love a good, sustained rant -- that isn't directed towards you -- that seems to end in catharsis, do yourself a favor and get it.  I'd definitely lean towards &quot;Audiobook,&quot; because Goldberg gets her point across as perfectly as if she was onstage.<br />Yes, Whoopi does use &quot;language,&quot; as she warns people at the beginning of the tape.  If you didn't get the implication, it means that she uses profanity from time to time, saying the &quot;s&quot; word, the &quot;f&quot; word and a few others, too.  She doesn't hold back, but says what she wants and expresses exasperation however she wants.  If you want polite commentary on some of the same issues, there's always etiquette books.  (Hey, Miss Manners is always amusing.)<br />Goldberg addresses her relationship with Ted Danson (mainly the minstrel decible), her premature status of grandmother, Clinton's extra-carricular activities as well as those of a few other recent presidents, discloses how she got her name and some stories from her childhood.  &quot;Audiobook&quot; is basically a series of essays about why she sees the world the way she does.<br />I don't always agree with her opinions.  Some of her essays are more serious than funny.  However, I did find this glimpse into her mind fascinating and engaging.  It feels a little like hanging out in the back booth of a diner while an outspoken friend holds court, which is probably one of the best statements I can make about what is essentially an autobiography.<br />Whoopi G. was never an easy artist to experience.

As someone who got really intrigued by parchment and fancy fonts when I got married, I'm rather surprised that the only version of this book still in print is the \\"Blue Book of Wedding Stationery.\\" After all, one can have a hoity-toity paper fetish without being engaged.<br />After a few years of hunting, I found a used of this book in a small used bookstore in downtown Seattle, and I may never give it up. Even though the editor (Feinberg is not credited as the author, and there's an introduction by Stanley Marcus) is bossy, unrelenting on some conventions and is essentially pushing Crane's engraving trade every step of the way, I'm still drawn in by the ellegance of \\"proper\\" social stationery. It's easy to take Feinberg's advice with a grain of salt: he seems to resent popular etiquette mavens who state that an extensive \\"stationery wardrobe\\" is not necessary, and that the most formal invitations are handwritten.<br />The introduction of this book gets into the history of paper-making and engraving, and the beginning of each section gets into either the history of the custom being described or stories behind that particular piece of social stationery.<br />I'm a tad disappointed by the section on calling cards -- a small fluffy book I saw on the subject once got a bit more into detail on what it meant if a particular corner was folded -- but the fact that Feinberg addresses the subject at all wins a point with me.<br />Other topics covered are the basic \\"stationery wardrobe\\" for both men and women, invitations to various occasions, wedding stationery (of course), greeting cards and announcements, \\"professional stationery,\\" forms of address and a brief history of Crane's. The book includes an occasional example of famous social stationery, such as a 1942 Christmas card from the President and Mrs. Roosevelt.<br />I've been online for ten years, but I still love sending and receiving paper letters. \\"Crane's Blue Book of Stationery:  The Styles and Etiquette of Letters, Notes and Inivitations,\\" snooty though it is, nurtures that love like few other books have.<br />Chapter headings include:<br />1.

Within one month, I'd been introduced to Jemiah Jefferson's books and read two of them: \\"Voice of the Blood\\" and \\"Wounds.\\" Both follow the same story, and \\"Wounds\\" is the sequel.<br />They are rather different books. While \\"Blood\\" is more of a vampiric erotica fantasy, \\"Wounds\\" is far, far closer to French Realism, like \\"Madame Bovary.\\" Unfortunately, I detested \\"Madame Bovary\\" and got through it based on sheer force of will. With \\"Wounds,\\" I managed through morbid fascination with the occasional reference to the previous book.<br />In \\"Wounds,\\" we find Daniel, child-vampire of Catholic-guilt-filled Ricari and sire of bitter, cunning Ariane, fascinated by the one person on the planet who he cannot, for all his attempts, read: Sybil, an apparently ordinary human who is really, really good at psychic and physical defense. Daniel, getting slightly tired of living for so long and watching friends die over and over, starts off by finding the aptly-named Sybil and interesting diversion and ends up bonded to her in ways about as powerful to his connection to vampires he's shared blood with. However, Sybil is also a dangerous psychopath who is haunted by a violent past, and is only drawn to Daniel based on how useful he can be to her.<br />The majority of this book is about their highly dysfunctional relationship, and I spent most of it wondering to Daniel, \\"why don't you just *kill* her?\\" and wishing I could just step into the plot and do both of them in myself. I am tempted to say that anyone who has a low tolerance for such connections in real life will find this book the literary equivalent of nails on a blackboard. Which, I suppose, means that it was well-written, because seeing a friend go through this sort of torture would drive me up the wall just as effectively.<br />So, I give this book three stars for being well-written and keeping me captivated in a way similar to how Daniel was kept so interested in Sybil. But I have to hold back two stars. One, a selfish star, because I was just too annoyed to really enjoy the book. One, a critical star because I really have no idea how the book ended. I even re-read the ending, and I'm still not entirely sure of the result, and probably won't know unless there's a third book. Maybe I blanked it from the trauma: the actions seemed fitting given what the characters had been up to so far. But whether the actions produced a result that would allow the book to end well ... I'm not sure.<br />Sybil would scold me for wanting the answers laid out for me easily. But then, Sybil is most of what annoyed me about this book.

When reading erotic novels, I tend to simply skip ahead to the \\"good parts\\" because the author usually fails to set up a world where I could care about the characters.  The author's energies seem to go into writing sex scenes rather than a fully engrossing story.<br />Carol Queen, whose short story submissions to \\"Herotica\\" and \\"The Best American Erotica\\" have been many of my favorite erotica stories ever, proves that she can work her same magic in novel (or novella) form.<br />I think that her sucess with this book is based in that the protangist (Miranda / Randy) and her fellow adventurers stay pretty much to the point of the book:  sex.  When they're not having it, they're talking about their sexual histories or waxing philisophical on their favorite intimate activities.  But here's the fun part:  they're not shallow.  These characters care about each other and build fascinatingly sturdy, loyal relationships.  We're not specifically told the passage of time between some chapters, but as the characters get more familar with each other, it's fairly obvious that chosen families are being built.<br />I don't recall any wasted words, or anything jarring in this book.  The sex is often rough, but there's nothing unconsensual going on.  It is the stuff of fantasy, but as such Queen has managed to make each fantasy important and relevant to the overall tale of gender-play, love, sex, rites of passage and the realm of the forbidden.<br />I am sorry to see that, as of this writing, this book is so hard to find.  Queen is a wonderful writer, and \\"The Leather Daddy and the Femme\\" beats the heck out of most of what I've seen out there.	2002-02-22

Maybe even cooler.  :)<br />Really, the book is what attracted me to this collection.  I saw it a few weeks ago, started reading the back of the box and realized that the book was pretty much what I'd been wanting for a while:  a book of parables.  I'd had a fondness for mythology since middle school, but rarely indulged to this degree.  The stories are from different paths (Sufism, Islam, Hinduism, Christiantity, etc.), and each corresponds to one of the 60 cards ... except when the cards double up on a story to impress an opposite meaning.  This deck, as is the Osho Zen Tarot, is named for a man who loved to tell such parables to his followers, the Bagwaan Shri Ragneesh (remember that old dude who led the commune in Oregon?), but he's only really mentioned in the intro and closing of the book.<br />Not having read many parables, I find this book utterly charming.  The cards and illustrations I find a bit less so, but I think that for the first time since collecting divination decks, the artwork is less important to me for understanding the meaning behind the cards.<br />The cards measure 5.25&quot; x 3.25&quot;, and are bordered with a grey pattern on the picture side.  The backs feature an orange circle painting that is also shown on the box.  The artwork is amazingly colorful and, while I've seen decks that are visually more appealing to me I will say that the drawings are very skillfully rendered and fairly often get across the point of the story.  I've been told that I have big hands for a woman, but I'd find this deck little tricky to shuffle playing-card style (which doesn't seem to suit the mood of the deck anyway).  The cards are covered with a semi-glossy and not terribly slick coating.<br />This deck is probably one of the best divinatory systems I've ever picked up.  The book is gripping, so as to not force memorization of the cards as much as to make reading them intuitive.  I feel as if I know -- a little bit -- the people portrayed in the stories ... and many of the meanings behind the cards are things I've consciously pondered on my own.<br />Aside from the word &quot;tarot,&quot; I feel that this deck is exactly what it's title claims it to be.  If you learn well from stories, I highly recommend this deck.and many of the meanings behind the cards are things I've consciously pondered on my own.<br />Aside from the word &quot;tarot,&quot; I feel that this deck is exactly what it's title claims it to be.

If you would like to own this companion to &quot;The Tao of Pooh,&quot; I suggest that you purchase it when you're in such a mood, or better yet, check it out from the library.<br />As other reviewers of written, there's much more ranting than philosophy in this book.  In &quot;Tao of Pooh,&quot; I felt like I was being taught Taoist philosophy from a new perspective.  That's what I naturally thought that I was getting into with the &quot;Te of Piglet.&quot;  Nope.  Hoff flirts with the idea briefly, but instead uses Piglet as a soap box to attack the Eyores of the world.  Interestingly enough, he eventually seems to realize what he's doing, and so does Piglet (who he spends more time having fictional conversations with than he does quoting the dear character).  And Piglet eventually takes him to task for it.<br />I think that Hoff was desperate.  Could he simply not find enough examples in the Pooh stories of Piglet's smallness being used for the betterment of the Wood?  I discussed this book with some frieds, and mentioned how the author seemed to be really reaching in his villification of Eyore:  in his fictional conversations, he has Eyore coming in to pester and depress everyone.  What my friends reminded me of is that, in the original Pooh stories, the characters GO TO EYORE the majority of the time when there's need for tension between the characters, for a less than optomistic view of the world, and even for someone to rescue.  Eyore is needed and loved *because* he is gloomy, not in spite of it.<br />And at the end, Piglet - small little Piglet who Hoff has misused in an effort to have his hissy fit (and, I presume, make his next car payment) - comes to Eyore's defense.  And, for once, however briefly, Hoff is blessedly speechless.less.	2001-01-28

For years, I used erotica books as surrogate fantasy material, believing that I was incapable of fantasizing during sex, that I had no fantasies of my own and had to use other people's.  Reading &quot;My Secret Garden&quot; changed my perception of myself drastically.  Those horrid, disturbing thoughts that floated into my brain, that I would shove down quickly as &quot;sick,&quot; were indeed fantasies.  The brave women who contributed their fantasies and feelings showed me that even if what I was drawn to was &quot;sick,&quot; it certainly wasn't uncommon.<br />I am especially grateful to the women who commented on making the decision to share, or not share, their fantasies with their lovers.  This was crucial for me.  At a time when my thoughts were to be confessed on demand, I deprived my lover by depriving myself:  those weren't fantasies, they were just random weird thoughts that made me uncomfortable.  However, after getting out of a bad relationship and realizing that my mind was my own toy, I realized that I could explore those thoughts without fear of exposure to anyone but myself.<br />One I allowed myself my own secret garden, I found that I could share with myself and my current lovers in a way that previous ones had tried to coerce out of me.  Living well is indeed the best revenge, and I thank Nancy Friday for her subversive assistence.<br />There are sections and chapters.  Here's a listing of the section headings:<br />Introduction:  Twenty-Five Years in the Garden<br />1.  &quot;Tell Me What You Are Thinking About,&quot; He Said<br />2.  &quot;Why Fantasize When You Have Me?&quot;<br />3.  The House of Fantasy<br />4.  &quot;Where Did A Nice Girl Like You Get An Idea Like That?&quot;<br />5.  Guilt and Fantasy, Or, &quot;Why The Fig Leaf?&quot;<br />6.  Fantasy Accepted<br />7.  Quickies<br />Afterword:  &quot;In Defense of Nancy Friday&quot; by Martin Shepard, M.D., psychiatrist<br />Along with fantasies submitted via taped interview and by mail, Friday includes her own analysis of the history of women's erotic nature, the era at the time of initial publication and the fantasies themselves.  There's no bibliography and no footnotes; she mostly refers to any sources in her text itself.  She's a good writer, whether I agree with her at each chapter or not.<br />Written letters are kept in the style in which they were sent.  Some of the women are amazingly articulate.  Some of the letters are a painful read from a literary standpoint.  But I think that enforces the idea that all of the submissions are genuine.<br />People who are interested in this book simply as another erotica compilation may well be disappointed.

My first introduction to totemism was a group of pagans I hung around with in college.  Some of them were really, really enthusiastic about this deck, but I only picked one up for myself within the last few years.  I even did my senior thesis on the idea of personal, urban totemism.  And even with all that, &quot;Medicine Cards&quot; scare the heck out of me.<br />Unless you believe that the only important totem animals are the ones that you can find on belt buckles (Eagle, Bear, Random Big Cat, etc.), there's no real Major Arcana/Minor Arcana distinction here.  Every single card in this deck is big ju-ju.  My first two readings kinda freaked me out, really.  If archetypes, animal mythos and anthropomorphism are pretty much second-nature to you, just give up and get this deck.  You will probably understand the cards without needing to check the book all that often.<br />Unless there was a slip-up at the publisher's, the standard deck does not come with a little reference pamphlet like most tarot decks do.  It comes with a medium-sized hard back book (A nice treat, but not convenient for lugging around spontaneously -- this could be why they made the &quot;Just for Today&quot; deck) that explains each card, including an occasional story, and some spreads and an exercise to figure out which totem animals represent you in this spread.  Two of three totems that I'd already figured out for myself showed up in the exercise, and the third was kinda iffy for me at that point anyway.<br />The cards are 5.5&quot; by 3&quot; and have an alarmingly boring back -- government blue with a single yellow lightening bolt.  They're coated with something incredibly shiny, but aren't particularly slippery.  There are 52 cards in the deck, plus 9 blanks so that you can fill it in with any animals that you think are missing.  They're almost a little too large for me to shuffle them easily (and I've been told that I have large hands for my gender).  The book's table of contents tells you what animals are included.<br />The artwork works inwards from a white boarder to a thinner red boarder that also bisects the interior design.  The top half of the inside is sky-blue, and the bottom is an earth-tone green.  In the middle is a Medicine Shield inside which is a picture of the featured animal spirit.  Above, in the blue, along with the number of the card, is the aniamls name in a black script font.<br />The artwork is good.  It's not cute, and it's not dazzlingly beautiful in a way that draws me, but I'm still impressed with this deck for all my nitpicky comments.

Complete with angels and demons.  There.  Did I get your attenion?  :)<br />&quot;The Law of Love&quot; is an incredibly ambitious project by the author of &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; and is almost worth it for the light it sheds on her previous work.  I've heard people write off Laura Esquivel as an author of &quot;chick books&quot; -- the marketing assumption being that if you add recipes, more women will read them.<br />I felt the theme of kitchen witchery was a little too strong in &quot;Chocolate&quot; to ignore ... but &quot;Law&quot; gives a much clearer picture.  Esquivel seems to be fascinated by the idea of memory recall through sensory stimulation.  In &quot;Chocolate,&quot; the stimulation was food.  In &quot;Law,&quot; it's music.<br />Included with the hardback was a CD of Mexican music.  I didn't much like it, but it is indeed meant to be played at certain times in the book where memories will be crucial.  Also, during points in the book where a character undergoes a past-life recall, the pages switch to unnarrated, very dreamily painted comics -- the regression is only mulled over in words as sort of an afterthought.<br />Again, incredibly ambitious.  Unfortunately, considering the scope, I didn't find it terribly well done.  Which is too bad, because I really wanted to *love* this book.  At best, I just like it.<br />The characters go from being intelligent people who are jerked around by circumstance to lovable, zany characters fumbling around with forces some of them might barely comprehend.  The ending is a very Monte Hall, &quot;let's show 'em what's behind Door Number Three!&quot; affair.  I question whether it could have gone any other way, but I feel that the fact that I was distanced enough from the book to be paying more attention to the style of the ending than caring if the story had progressed is rather telling of the book's style.<br />I could picture the director of &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; making &quot;Law&quot; into a movie (most likely starring Antonio Bandaras as either the main love interest or the guardian angel) -- that's how weird the story became.<br />And yet, this book gave me a lot to think about.  I feel that if Esquivel can't consistently deliver stories the calibur of &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; it's at least fascinating to watch her take risks with novels like &quot;The Law of Love.&quot;  Did she take on too much?  Possibly.  But I don't feel that it was a wasted effort.  I just feel that it could have been a better story.e Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; making &quot;Law&quot; into a movie (most likely starring Antonio Bandaras as either the main love interest or the guardian angel) -- that's how weird the story became.  <br />And yet, this book gave me a lot to think about.

When I finally found a way to learn tarot that worked for me, I looked at all the pretty decks I'd collected over the years very critically. I purged my collection because I found that I was simply not drawn to some of them for anything other than the cute art, if that. One of the tests I used to decide what would stay was to lay out all of the cards from each deck side by side, and compare each member of the arcana and court with those of the other decks.<br />The \\"Halloween Tarot\\" had enough fascinating ideas to be worth keeping. It fit the keyword system of learning Rider-Waite I'd grasped, has adorable art and seemed to be a very agonized-over deck. The descriptions of the Pages as being logistics mavens really opened my eyes, and the execution of those cards reflects the meaning almost perfectly. This deck has, hands down, the best \\"Lovers\\" card I've ever seen: it mixes the literal idea of the card, the idea of Halloween *and* the Rider-Waite meaning altogether. And I'm just ashamed to admit how long it took me to get the pun of \\"The Devil\\" card.<br />Unfortunately, this ability to mix all three concepts together doesn't seem spread evenly throughout the deck. And because of that, I haven't used is as much as I'd like to. I have hopes that I'll get it eventually, but not having it click immediately keeps me from giving it a full five stars. (Yes, I'm picky. :)<br />The deck I bought did not come with the full, hard-back book, but with a carefully written pamphlet, complete with the occasional character from the deck, some sample spreads, the origin of the deck and some history of Halloween. The cards measure approximately 4.75\\" x 2.75\\" and have a fairly elaborate orange and black mirror-image on the back. They are coated like standard playing cards but a tad thinner and more flexible. And yes, as per the pamphlet, the black cat appears in each one. :)<br />Whether for yourself or as a gift, I think the \\"Halloween Tarot\\" is worthwhile.

US	52845354	RPWIT6VXOSORN	0061053716	330724227	Imajica	Books	5	24	25	N	N	I used to hate fantasy novels.	I think it's because I never had the proper background for it:  never got read fairy tales as a child (cue the sad violin music in the background), only saw &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as an animated movie, didn't even own a copy of Grimm's Fairy Fales until I was in my mid-twenties.  Sad, huh?<br />Then, after a little pondering, I figured out some of my problem:  since I didn't have the fantasy background, I'd need a guide through the fantasy world -- a protagonist who was as much a stranger to the area and culture as I was.  I requested book titles on a local bbs (boy, oh boy, did *that* spark discussion), and this was one of the titles mentioned.  I'd read some Barker before, and gave it a go.<br />Oh.  My.<br />Do not, under any circumstances, let the size of this book intimidate you.  Yes, you could use it to fend off an attacker -- consider that a bonus.  I was SORRY THAT THE NOVEL HAD ENDED when I finished it.  And yes, I read the big &quot;single&quot; edition.<br />Descriptions of the Imagica made me think of faeries and Dr. Suess and foreign countries all rolled together.  I have never wanted to go walking in an enchanted wood before, nor have I ever been quite so fascinated by snails.  I think that Barker excells at writing long novels:  he's my anti-Steven King.  I could picture the weather and the landscape without the images in my head feeling cartoony, as they usually tend to.  I was lost in the Imagica and didn't want to come out.<br />This novel starts in our world, and while that's what I really need to get going with fantasy novels, I initally found that the length of the book and the images of how dreary our world was kept me from picking it back up for long stretches at a time.

As someone who got really intrigued by parchment and fancy fonts when I got married, I'm rather surprised that the only version of this book still in print is the \\"Blue Book of Wedding Stationery.\\" After all, one can have a hoity-toity paper fetish without being engaged.<br />After a few years of hunting, I found a used of this book in a small used bookstore in downtown Seattle, and I may never give it up. Even though the editor (Feinberg is not credited as the author, and there's an introduction by Stanley Marcus) is bossy, unrelenting on some conventions and is essentially pushing Crane's engraving trade every step of the way, I'm still drawn in by the ellegance of \\"proper\\" social stationery. It's easy to take Feinberg's advice with a grain of salt: he seems to resent popular etiquette mavens who state that an extensive \\"stationery wardrobe\\" is not necessary, and that the most formal invitations are handwritten.<br />The introduction of this book gets into the history of paper-making and engraving, and the beginning of each section gets into either the history of the custom being described or stories behind that particular piece of social stationery.<br />I'm a tad disappointed by the section on calling cards -- a small fluffy book I saw on the subject once got a bit more into detail on what it meant if a particular corner was folded -- but the fact that Feinberg addresses the subject at all wins a point with me.<br />Other topics covered are the basic \\"stationery wardrobe\\" for both men and women, invitations to various occasions, wedding stationery (of course), greeting cards and announcements, \\"professional stationery,\\" forms of address and a brief history of Crane's. The book includes an occasional example of famous social stationery, such as a 1942 Christmas card from the President and Mrs. Roosevelt.<br />I've been online for ten years, but I still love sending and receiving paper letters. \\"Crane's Blue Book of Stationery:  The Styles and Etiquette of Letters, Notes and Inivitations,\\" snooty though it is, nurtures that love like few other books have.<br />Chapter headings include:<br />1.

You don't have to be an anthropology student to find this book approachable.  With Nisa's straight-forward monologues about her life, you could probably finish this book in a day, curled up on a blanket under a tree.  That's how I plan to read the sequel.<br />This book is full of gossip and stories, basically bridging gaps between that of Nisa's world and my own.  She's an outsider's insider:  just weird enough to be out on the fringes of the !Kung and thus accessible to Shostak.  But that becomes a problem later on the book -- Nisa's peers have warned the author that Nisa lies, but it's not until Nisa tells a rather impressive story about herself that Shostak begins to dismiss her as unreliable.<br />Which makes me think that the only reason Shostak published the book is that she'd spent too much time on Nisa not to.  And that's why I'm not giving Shostak's work a full five stars -- I liked Nisa a heck of a lot more than I liked Shostak based on this work.<br />Is Nisa a liar?  Or is the problem that she tells truths that others don't want to face?  Whatever your opinion, I think you'll find this book a good read whether or not you have an anthropological background.  I still have a copy.  :)	2000-12-26

One of the things that I adore about this book is that I picked it up at a time when I had no idea what I was doing with Wicca and Paganism, but found this book so accessible that I began using ideas from it.  The most important way that it was accessible to me was that I found things suggested in it that I'd already been doing unconsciously.<br />&quot;I suggest that the only books that influence us are those for which we are ready, and which have gone a little farther down our particular path than we have yet gone ourselves.&quot;  I'm certain that E. M. Forster was right.  I found Cunningham's explanations of certain things I'd been doing intriguing, even if those explanations didn't quite ring true for me.  And from there, I was better able to take some of his other houselore seriously.<br />When he can offer them, Cunningham suggests multiple ways to address an issue, and different cultures' explanations for why and how a certain tradition works.  Indeed, this book was the first I'd ever heard of Feng Shui, long before it became the popular money-making scheme Westerners have turned it into.  He devotes as much time to it as he does to any alternative, which will probably keep this book on my Craft shelf for a long time.<br />Find this book, take your pick, and create your own path.	2000-12-26

First off, this is not a book about the Moroccan people.  It is a book about the ethnographer's experience with a community of Moroccan people.  I assume that, somewhere out there, is a university press publication of his actual findings gathering dust on a shelf.  Instead, this book is about some of the more uncomfortable aspects of anthropology and the destroying of illusions.<br />Questions of finding the outsider's insider (someone enough on the fringes to be willing to take you under their wing, but not so much that they don't have a good in-road into their own culture), of the purity of research (did you have to pay these people before they'd bother to talk to you?  Were they expecting payment based on relations with other enthnographers?), and how much one can really understand a culture just by sitting a watching it (as opposed to participating, which threatens objectivity) are the issues Rabinow faced, and what he wrote about.<br />&quot;Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco&quot; is just that, memoirs on the process of the research itself, not Rabinow's findings.  There are interesting comments on Rabinow's interactions with his insiders, but rarely the sort that could go into a standard academic tome.  This answer to the delima of objectivity, splitting one's experiences into an official report and a journal of sorts, is one I'd like to see more of.	2000-12-26

Alexandra Stoddard refers to a time when she was a starving student, but from her description, she has never gone hungry due to not being able to afford food.  If you don't have some spare cash left over at the end of each month, or aren't willing to stretch things a bit, this book may not be for you.<br />However, considering that I once *did* go hungry for a brief period of time, earned pathetic paychecks and still cared enough about my surroundings to make tough (perhaps even stupid) decisions for the sake of my sanity, I simply roll my eyes at some of her claims and read between the lines.<br />Suggestions in this book include considering decorative hat boxes for day-to-day storage, investing in a fountain pen rather than another few packages of disposables, treating yourself to flowers when you can, going into sumptous stores to get ideas (which I tend to use in more pedestrian stores when I actually start buying stuff :).  And that's just what I can remember.<br />&quot;Living a Beautiful Life&quot; gave me the foundation to really start thinking about my environment, what I wanted and what I didn't.  Organization could lead not just to efficiency, but to beauty.  I have friends who are slightly more destitute than I am.  I have a friend who is a millionaire.  I have friends who are inbetween and they all look at my home and marvel at the fact that they couldn't imagine me living anywhere else.<br />And I don't think that I would have been able to do it without Stoddard's repeated encouragement, which seemed to be telling me that whatever it was I could do for myself, I was more than worth it.	2000-12-26
US	52845354	R23SII689PMAPN	1572811188	22511498	Diamond Tarot	Books	5	16	16	N	N	I used to dislike Rider-Waite.	Earlier this year, I attended a beginner's class on reading the tarot, and while this class helped me better understand Rider-Waite symbology, I still wasn't interested in the cards themselves.  They seemed very dull to me, and the Rider-Waite I had stayed mainly unused even after the class.<br />So, I packed up several decks that hadn't made sense to me, took them to a metaphysical store that buys used decks, and went hunting.  Then I saw the Diamond Tarot.<br />This deck could suck for a beginner, because while it uses Pamela Colman Smith's illustrations for the R-W, they are reduced in size and set into a fractal-like border.  The border  sometimes includes obvious symbols from the particular card it surrounds, but most often reflects an assumed mood from the card.  Also, the colors of the cards have been, I presume, digitally enhanced a tad so they don't appear quite as flat.  The whole deck just seems livelier without being painful to look at.<br />My reaction to this deck was &quot;oooooooh,&quot; a reaction that I have not had before or since to any other R-W deck.  Diamond is Rider-Waitey enough to feel familiar and like a good workhorse deck, but pretty enough for me to want to work with it.  Whodda thunk?<br />So, if you've pretty much given up on Rider-Waite as not being able to call to you, go to a new-agey store that has deck samples on display and see if they have the Diamond Tarot.  Or find a deck review website that contains pictures.  I think you'll find the research worth your while.	2000-12-23

A lot of people may be put off by the idea of an &quot;African Tarot Deck,&quot; thinking that it must involve voudou, arcane tribal symbolism, or just be for black people.  Well, I'm a black woman who has shown this deck to white friends -- this deck is completely accessible.<br />The &quot;African Tarot:  Journey into the Self&quot; is a teeny little deck based on Rider-Waite symbology.  It also looks like it was drawn by a child with talent -- the sort of art that you'd *want* to put on your fridge.  The people are brown and have kinky hair, and they live in an African village -- after that, and a few liberties with the suit cards -- it's a standard deck.<br />The suits, by the way, are traditionally named.  However, the art shows Swords as spears, Cups as gourds and Pentacles as coins or disks.  The art is rich and perhaps a tad dark for some, perhaps it's best not to read this one in low light -- but then, it's far from a gothic deck.  The back design is equally darling -- two colorful tortoises in the sun, reversed from each other so you can see one of them upright as long as you're holding the card lengthwise.  According to the South African author, the Shangaan culture considers this animal a symbol of &quot;the slow coming of justice&quot; -- appropraite enough considering its country of origin.<br />The cards are approximately 3&quot; x 2.5&quot; and covered with what I assume is a standard, slick coating.  This makes them easy to shuffle, but I have a habit of dropping some cards if I'm just going through them while holding them in my hands.<br />I even find the package a total keeper:  a brown, corregated cardboard box with descriptive cards glued to the back and front.  A rubberband to keep the box closed and you could probably drop this deck into your backpack and only have the box take damage.  However, the box is so cute, why would you want to?<br />The little booklet inside confirms the image that this is a feel-good deck -- many of the interpretations are positive or at least encouraging of growth.  So, while this isn't an all-ocassion deck, I certainly think it's worth a look!ons are positive or at least encouraging of growth.

When I heard that Pinkwater had written a  novel  mainly about fat people, I couldn't wait to get my hands on  it.<br /> I'm  not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.<br /> At first I thought  that the author hated fat folk, but as I kept reading, I began to sense a  theme:  Pinkwater seems to be  attacking obesessions.  Whether your  obession is food, fitting  in, chubby chasing, weight loss, paperback  writing, or family  tradition -- it doesn't matter.  If you're obsessed  with it,  &quot;The Afterlife Diet&quot; will make you feel like a putz  about it.<br /> But this isn't an entirely bad thing.  Pinkwater seems to be  poking as much fun at himself as he is anyone else.  As far as fat people  go, his point is that everyone can just relax about the concept:  it's not  good, it's not bad -- it just is.<br /> As another review pointed out, this  book is kinda choppy.  I found it easy to put it down for days and start  another, much more gripping, book.  I finished &quot;The Afterlife  Diet&quot; because I had started it, not because I was getting much out of  it.<br /> So, this book is okay.  I wish that I could say something amazing  about it due to the subject matter, but if you want light reading where the  fat characters are just as messed up as everyone else, this novel may very  well do the trick for you.	2000-08-15

What more could  you want?<br />Many of the people pictured on the cards seem stoic to the  point of expressionless.  The descriptions in the booklet are a bit out  there even for a tarot deck.  I wish I could have gotten more of a feel  from this tarot, because seeing people who look like me in a deck is really  refreshing.<br />It is not a great learning deck, but probably has a lot of  potential once I have more a of a clue.	2000-06-27

I haven't seen every single tarot deck in existence.  But still -- yeesh.<br />I got this set free from a friend who just didn't want it anymore.  I accepted it because I remember watching  a James Bond movie where Jane Seymour use it to tell his future.  Legend  has it that the deck was made for the movie, and that the hugely deformed  people and garish colors were for the benefit of the cameras.<br />The Minor  Arcana are ... sad, really.  Each element has its own color, but there are  just the proper number of wands/coins/swords/cups on each card, no  illustration suggesting the meaning behind the number-element combination.  The Major Arcana are a little better, but not by much -- a lot of meaning  is lost and if you don't have a fetish for raven-haired, tattooed people,  it's pretty pointless.<br />This deck is probably okay for anyone who got  interested in tarot watching 007 movies, but only as a sentimental  collector piece.  This is a deck that only a fan-girl could love.	2000-06-27

I never did learn anything about reading tarot with this deck, and would have to be really  good with tarot to even try a reading with it a few years from now.<br />I  guess it'd be a good deck if you really didn't want the person getting the  reading to get much of an idea of what the cards meant before you put your  own spin on them.

Unfortunately, that was back when I had basically given up trying to understand the traditional tarot, and this system came along.  The PoMo deck almost isn't tarot in the traditional sense -- a lot of the original  symbolism is removed for more faithful reproduction of the artwork Williams  wants to feature.<br />It's an excellent introduction to PostModern art and  art criticsm, and a way to see that there are many different ways of  interpreting the tarot.  I found that once I was able to learn more  traditional tarot through the &quot;keyword&quot; system, though, PoMo made  almost no sense at all -- it's its own little universe.<br />The cards, btw,  are both huge and flimsy:  not the best combination.  However, I like the  art style and plan to keep my deck for its own sake.	2000-06-27

Dodson  was such an effective speaker that I dug out the book just to get more of  the inside story.<br />Those who call this a partial autobiography and a  &quot;why to&quot; more than &quot;how to&quot; book are quite right -- for  &quot;how to,&quot; I'd suggest her video.  However, like with other forms  of sex, there can be a difference between getting off from masturbating and  actually feeling like a worthwhile person during and afterwards.  To my  mind, that's what this book is about.<br />Some of Dodson's ideas are indeed  still controversial:  she suggests non-monogomy, to the point of  extra-marital affairs, as potential help for sexual problems; she suggests  that people talk to each other, even to their parents, about masturbation;  the medically researched link between masturbation and  meditation/creativity was news to me.<br />I don't think the era we live in  will determine whether this book is still necessary -- I think it'll be  whether anyone still reacts to it with wonder and relief.	2000-06-27

My friends were appalled that I hadn't read &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; in 1996.  Actually offended, in some cases.  I'd heard of it, but never seen a copy until I got the first two graphic novels as Christmas gifts that year.<br /> They were right.  It's appalling that this book doesn't get more circulation.<br /> The charactes are complex (to put it mildly) and compelling.  Katchoo has a secret past, and  Francine has a standard, if slightly interesting, present.  Freddy, Francine's annoying boyfriend, pretty much stays annoying and luckilly gets  what's coming to him more than a few times.  Be warned:  keeping track of all the supporting characters is something that not even the author, Terry Moore, claims to feel up to.<br /> Speaking of the author, in the introduction to one of the compilations I have, Moore claims not to understand why there are so many angry women in the world, and why they don't seem to understand how much power they actually *do* wield.  In! terestingly enough, Moore does seem to have a grasp of why so many women are angry, but doesn't seem to realize that he's been explaining this  while writing &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot;.  This is kinda sad, and not unlike the situations his characters find themselves in.<br /> &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; is a soap opera that deals with relevant themes, a comic book about serious topics, and a novel that causes me to laugh out loud.  I strongly enourage you to invest in &quot;The Complete Strangers In Paradise Volume One&quot; and to start picking up the single issues.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.	1998-07-29

I was desperately bored and determined  not to squander money, so I picked up a book by  the new master of horror.<br /> Well, even a master has his off months.<br /> The only reason I finished this book was because I  didn't want to believe I had wasted my money.  However, I was none too keen on Barker for months  afterward, until seeing &quot;Nightbreed&quot; and  &quot;Hellraiser.&quot;  He could apparently write good,  memorable stories for the screen when he tried, so  what had happened with &quot;The Damnation Game?&quot;<br /> I think that part of my problem is that he was so  concerned with squicking his audience that he  failed to go for a memorable theme.  I remember  the Razor Eater, and the really gross part at  the end of the book ... and that's *it*.  I'm only  this bad with remembering his short stories, for  crying out loud!<br /> Maybe &quot;The Damnation Game&quot; should have been a  short story.  Perhaps there was a point to the  book that was buried under too much plot.

This book is divided into three themed sections:<br /><br /> 1.  Lestat believes in his own press releases.<br /><br /> 2.  Anne Rice complains about how awful it is to be human instead of one of those pristine lil' vampires she writes about.<br /><br /> 3.  The plot advances.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, section two is HUGE.  Lestat takes his first tinkle in a many hundred years.  Lestat attempts to have sex.  Lestat rediscovers body odor.  Lestat completely and utterly fails to remember anything about being human and had me looking away from the book in embarassment at his behavior.<br /><br /> If Rice wanted to write an essay on how much she wants to be a vampire, couldn't she just have written something non-fiction and let these characters have a rest for a while?<br /><br /> The problem here is that this book may very well be important to the rest of the series if Rice ever starts writing The Chronicles again, rather than using Lestat as a soapbox.  The last third of the book has some very important changes happen in Lestat's circle, so I can't just tell you to ignore it.  Also, the book is nearly worthwhile for two characters.  To the dog, I wish an appropriately long and happy life.  To the nun, I wish her own book entirely -- I found her fascinating.<br /><br /> So ... if you really adore Rice's love of hearing herself talk, or if you really want to keep up with characters who have become important to you, perhaps checking this book out from the library will make the investment of time less painful for you.  If you're just curious, avoid this book.  It will take up hours of your life for very little payoff.	1997-08-16

After going through several wedding planners at my local library, I thought I had a feel for them.  Quick reads, usually well-laid out, with about 50% actually having more than one or two new ideas.  I was not prepared for a thesis-thick presentation on currrent and historical marriage customs throughout the world.<br /><br /> This book was sorely in need of an index.<br /><br /> However, it was also useful.  So many customs were detailed that you could probably find justification for about 70% of anything &quot;non-traditional&quot; you wanted to do and seek out a tradition that matched it.  Very handy.  This book will be especially good for anyone who wants astrology to figure prominently in their wedding, as it's one of the author's favorite subjects.<br /><br /> If you're interested in a New Age-like report on marriage and related lore throughout the world, get this book.	1997-08-13

A good wedding book for couples who aren't networthy.  Basically, this book is almost completely composed of quotes from brides around the country about various topics (dresses, food, attendants, what they would have done differently, etc.).<br /><br /> It looks like one of those books authors keep soliciting advice for on Usenet.  So, if you're already willing to spend lots of time on-line, I'd give this one a miss.  If you know someone who's not networthy but who could benefit from such advice, you may want to pick them up a copy.	1997-08-13

This book calls itself a wedding planner, but I don't recall too many sections that actually required the reader to ponder what they wanted, or for actually getting organized within certain sections.<br /><br /> What this book suceeded at is suggested by it's title:  I really wanted to use a broom in our wedding ceremony by the time I'd finished this book.<br /><br /> Sadly, not much else in the book suited me.  It assumes a wedding where everyone involved is black, where there's a close community full of older friend and relatives, and where Afrocentric items are readily available or where you're willing to do mail-order and thus not get to bargain-hunt.<br /><br /> For me, this book was only good for inspiration which, while nice, is less than what the title prepared me for.	1997-08-13

It many ways it's a standard wedding planner, but it was one great<br />feature:  an &quot;Unexpected Situations&quot; section.  I<br /> certainly didn't want to think about anyone falling ill (or worse) at our wedding, but these are important factors to consider.<br /><br /> If your current wedding planner isn't prompting you to take such things into consideration, hunt up this slightly out-of-date but useful book.	1997-08-13

This book is a combination of advice and worksheets for planning your wedding/commitment ceremony.  It includes sample services with an<br /> emphasis on intercultural ceremonies.<br /><br /> It's ... okay.  The author seems to concentrate so much on the types of ceremonies she's lead in her work, that this book is a bit more of a departure from the type of guide I was hoping for.  While she's got some good ideas, I think the book's main strength is the author asking you about the parts of the ceremony she outlines, asking you what you find important.  The rest of the book ... well, wasn't necessary to me.	1997-08-13

From the very beginning of the book, the author has a chip on his shoulder.<br /><br /> Basically, Feinberg works for Crane's Stationery.  Okay, fine.  However, he almost immediately feels the need to discredit any etiquette maven who has said that you don't need a complete set of obscure, engraved stationery to generate proper correspondence.<br /><br />However, if there's something wedding-related that you want to do in style, there's a good chance that he'll have an answer for you.  Wedding, shower and party invitations; thank-you notes; reaffirmations of vows; etc.  If you want to do it with engraved stock, he'll happily give you the proper way to do it.  And if you happen to get that stock from Crane's, all the better, right?<br /><br /> Granted, the author is still a stickler for<br /> wording conventions and will give you a flat-out &quot;No&quot; on many current standards.  Examples abound, and I believe there's a section on how to address certain political figures.<br /><br /> This book could be a handy reference to hand around between couples as more and more of your<br /> peers marry.  Concise with a good index, the author's execuction, if not his motives, are presented quite smoothly.	1997-08-13

The author has a Dave Barry writing-style which made this book a relaxing read while planning our wedding.  However, he actually brought up relevant, but obscure, issues like checking out the site for potential construction on your wedding day, handling the parking situation, etc.<br />Few wedding planners actually go over this sort of stuff except in retrospect, and it's nice to see it suggested.<br /><br /> However, these suggestions are presented as something the groom can do while control of the rest of his wedding day is being handled by the women.  While the defeatist attitude is amusing in that it goes with the writing-style, it's rather shaking to see in an actual wedding planner.<br /><br /> I recommend this book highly:  just be preapred for the overall theme.	1997-08-13

Further proof that you can have any sort of wedding you jolly-well want, this book features several firsthand accounts of the planning and experience of commitment ceremonies.  It starts with a very educational section on the history of lesbian relationships in the Western world, which I would highly recommend to anyone ignorant on the subject.<br /><br /> This isn't a wedding planner and doesn't<br /> advertise itself as such, but it's an excellent introduction to the subject of women marrying women.	1997-08-13

Opulent receptions in glamourous settings are the stars of this book. I don't recall if anyone detailed their actually ceremony, just their clothes and reception. Eeek.<br />However, this book does have one saving grace. There's one teensy little sidebar that asks you to pick a limited number of adjectives that describe what type of wedding you want. I actually found this quite helpful, because it assists you in putting your plans into perspective.  Check it out from the library, if this intrigues you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the rest is pretty much a pagent of black, gold and silver lame' that's very reminiscent of Oscar party photos.  It's impressive, certainly, and perfectly obvious that the couple wanted what was ultimately to throw a big blow out party, but ... I guess it's a book on how to use money rather than personality to celebrate your wedding day.  I don't recall one example of a couple using *both*.	1997-08-13

It never happened, but it's true!  - Neil Gaiman	Although the copy I read in high school has Jim<br />Morrison's face on the front and the back-cover<br /> blurb suggests that he and the protagonist are<br /> together at every moment, this book simply features him as an interesting, annoying, odd and infrequent supporting character.<br /><br /> I think I great deal of Strete's poetry was lost<br /> on me the first few times I read this, but I have<br /> little desire to read it again.  I found it compelling as a teenager, but knew at the time that I was missing something.  Now that I could<br /> appreciate it, I don't think the story is complex<br /> enough to warrant another try.<br /><br /> I mainly get the impression that I never want to<br /> be a roadie, and that I should very carefully<br /> select the people whom I may run away from home with for a week.<br /><br /> If you like poetic prose and have even a slight interest in the sort of environment Morrison may have been in, you may want to pick up this book.  You'll probably get more out of it than I did.  However, if neither interests you, give it a miss.<br />It's ... okay.	1997-07-25

He wanted to write about gangs in the mid-fifties.  So he joined one.<br /><br /> This story is about how this one stupid mistake managed to haunt him for years afterward.  It's not a happy book, but it's important.  It's an historical account and it effects Ellison to this very day.  There's a lot of ranting about the system and of children thrown away -- a lot of anger.  And it seems justified.<br /><br /> I don't have the personal experience to say whether or not this book is accurate, but it's certainly gripping and convincing.<br /><br /> It's an ordeal.	1997-07-24

As a Northern black kid raised by Southern black parents, I recommend this book to people raised like me.  It answers about as many questions as it raises.<br /><br /> Being of a Western mindset, I eventually gave up ever trying to find some way to make voudou more accessable to me.  I may be African-American, but I'm neither African nor Cuban.  Teish's book is primarily about the voudou of New Orleans, which is mixed with Catholicism, Amerind and Western pagan traditions.  I think I've found in-road.<br /><br /> Want the story on the woman responsible for modern American Voudou, Man'zelle Marie LaVeau?  On the voudou-Catholic connection?  On how the Seven African Powers relate to the saints, the planets and the elements?  On what is meant by &quot;the devil is beating his wife?&quot;  Want to get scared out of making a spirit doll for yourself?  How about getting guided away from hexing as a way of life?<br /><br /> This ... is a good book.  If you've gotten frustrated when trying to learn about voudou, this is a great place to start.	1997-07-24

Then he falls in love.<br /><br /> I read this book over eight years ago and still remember it well enough to recall how bittersweet it is.

The product of generations of breeding, a young woman exists to provide blood best described as &quot;The Golden,&quot; an elixir that can get the most jaded vampire drunk as a skunk from just a taste.  For years the creme de la creme of vampire society has been waiting for just a sip of her.<br /><br /> She's just been found murdered and drained.<br /><br /> And so, in a castle full of grumpy, snobby, ancient vampires, a young-blood with a police background is charged with finding the murderer.  Granted, his suspects could easily tear him to pieces, but Michel is eager to bring the murderer to justice because our young detective was one of the few who sampled The Golden before she died.<br /><br /> Shepard manages to use elegant writing to evoke a mood and period without creating a 500-plus page exercise in listening to himself talk.  The book and the world it shows feels lush and decadent.  I find this book unique in that it has the single best description of the sun as an enemy that I have ever read.<br /><br /> I recommend this book for people interested in 80's and 90's vampire novels that have a historical feel to them.	1997-07-22

(With special guest appearance by Alice Dunbar Nelson!)<br />I've tried loaning this book to four different people. None of them seem interested in it until I start giving away what I consider to be the good bits. You've been warned.<br /><br />Gomez writes feminist vampires and portrays a kinder, gentler vampirism than I'm used to. They have small clan-like societies based on philosophy of life rather than ability. The act of drinking blood isn't a near-rape for one clan, but a \\"sharing.\\" These vampires leave hopes, dreams and inspiration to the random people upon whom they feed. Rather than murder, Gilda herself may have saved a life through her hunger.<br /><br />The book follows Gilda from the late 1800's through to the early 2000's. It also follows her small cell of vampire family from a time when they were the stuff of legend to their exposure.<br /><br />This is a fine book. It's the first I've read that actually uses the idea of running water as a problem for vampires, or the passing on of a name and legend from one vampire to the other. Gomez's writing is clear and somewhat poetic, and her ideas are sweet enough to even make the legendary bloodsucking demons of the night seem like kind, gentle, neighborly folk. Please read it.	1997-07-22
