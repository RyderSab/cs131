This nove was as flat as a paved road. It had very little substance to it. it seemed as though the author was simply just putting words on paper. none of the character a very well drawn, i couldn't understand or empathize with anything they were doing. I also didn't like the preachiness aspect of the novel.  So why three stars? Because of the poetry. Huh, poetry in a novel? Yeah SMS is a novel bound together wih poems written by the main character throught various stages of his life. To be completely honest the poetry is the best part of SMS, it's insightful, uplifting and subtle. Somethine that Mr. Bryants prose is not. It seems as though he had  some poems that he wanted to publish and he wrote a story to surround them. Perhaps he should have just published a book of poetry, I would've enjoyed it  much more.  I believe that Mr. Bryant had the best intentions in writing this novel. I commend him for tring to write a novel that deals with black men and their relationship with God. But good intentions do not make a good novel.  Single man screaming isn't a bad novel it's just not a very good one. Pehaps Mr Bryant will do better next time.	2001-01-17

At first glance Waiting in vain looks like just another love story that it seems every body is writng these days. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. But waiting in vain is more than a simple love story of boy meets girl. It deals with multi-faceted story that deals with a variety of issues; class, homosexuality, and child abuse.  Waiting in vain is essentially an novel about a group of artists, their hang-up's, confusions, passions, pains and insecurities. It's main charaters are Fire the jamaican born writer and Sylvia a  succesful magazine editor.  Channers writing is the true strength of Waiting in vain. He writes a lot like a painter, with broad strokes of words he paints a beautiful word picture.  The novel shifts locations from the strets of brooklyn to the beaches of jamiaca with a stop in london in-betwen. Another thing i liked about Waiting in... was the fact that it dealt with issues in the west indian community. It's something you don't regularly read about in a mainstream novel. So why no five stars, well it's small nitpicky things like the fact that the main character Fire was a little too perfect. I liked the relationship between Fire and Sylvia, there should've been more interraction betwen them. Also the ending while satisfying nded a little too neat. Real life usually doesn't come together in nice neat little corners. But all in all Waiting in vain is a very good read. It's better than your average  &quot;love story&quot; because it dealt with much more than just the love aspect of it. It's very good debut novel. Colin Channers writing is a pleasure to read  and hopefully  I wont be waiting in vain for his next novel	2001-01-17

As a longtime reader of Stephen King's novels, I was pleasantly suprised by his latest offering. A memior/instructional book on writing. The book is seperated into three parts. The first part of it roughly (very roughly) sketches Stephen Kings early years. His childhood, high school, college and beyond are layed out like snapshots of his early life. This part quite entertaining, informative  and quite honest. It really helps you understand where Mr. king has come from. What he's gone through and obstacles he's ovecome. <br />The second part of on writing, the real meat and potatoes of it deals with the  craft, mechanics and business of writing. He covers mostly all of the basics from grammar, syntax  and dialogue to ,description,theme and style. He does so in a very straighforward  but non-pretentious manner. Also On writing is not from  pat yourself on the back writers book school which gives the writer pie in the sky, unrealistic expectations and unworthy praise. King's lessons and advice are almost the exact opposite, more like tough love.  His Hemmingway like advice, is basically place your backside firmly to the seat and write is a real change of pace from the wait until inspiration arrives , write whenever you feel like it books. But he's not all tough talk and simple solutions. I found his door closed, door open philosophy to be the most important advice to aspiring writers.<br />The final part of on writing deals with Stephen kings accident and recovery. It was interesting to know how seriously injured he was after his accident. He notes that writing this book helped save his life. <br />There is also a short piece of writing by him that he uses to show how and what  he edits. It shows you thaty even best selling novelists need to edit. There is also a recommended reading list attached. Spread throught On.. is Kings trademark dry wit which makes this book not only informative but very readable and enjoyable. On writing is essential for all  Stephen King fans and would be writers. Door close.....	2000-11-20

There are some 50 or so snapshots of these man the spread throughout four hotels, The white house, the providence, the andrews and the sunshine hotel. Don't let the names of these hotels fool you they're no four seasons. The men come from various races, creeds and generations. Some are old men who've lived on the bowery for tens of years and don't want to live to younger men who have hit rock bottom and are trying to get back on their feel again. Each man featured tells his own story about how they got to the bowery. Most of their stories are sobering and the pictures are even more powerful. Many of these men were woking productive members of society until something happened to them to throw them off track. It is hard to leave a book like this one unaffected. If your only opinion of the homeless and destitute is that they are lazy, mentally deranged or drug addicted men this book may change your perceptions. I left this book feeling very somber about how fragile life is and how easily it can be taken for granted yet also feeling uplifted in a strange way. Many of these man despite their conditions still continue to keep on living their lives and keeping a postive attitude.  The men in flophouse are a dying breed of america's growing underclass.	2000-10-26

These postcards are indicative of that. The national museum of art has released a book of postcards by Aaron Siskind entitled Harlem the 30's. A wonderful collection of depression era photographs depicting harlem at that time. Most books about Harlem seem to mostly be preoccupied with the Harlem Renaissance  and the people around that time. Harlem the 30's is about a different time a time after the renaissance when the depression hit the country.  The collection is a real snapshot of what it was like to live , work, and play in Harlem in the 1930's. These 30  black and white postcards are not of celeberties but of real people  from professionals to the street vendors to the children, even the homeless. Well worth it if you are a collector of B&amp;W postcards like myself, or like want to see a good piece of history.	2000-10-16

Perhpaps I'm a cynic but i'm really enjoyed this novel, even the downbeat ending It wasn't the best piece of literature that i've ever read but it definetely was very compelling. Credit that to Wood's writing which really puts you there. Imagine a world in which there was no ozone layer? Earths inhabitants are forced to live in cities surrounded by huge domes that protect them from a merciless sun. Outside of the domes is a vast desert of blistering heat.   That is the setting for Faraday's orphans the latest novel by N. Lee Wood. It follows  Berk Nielsen, a immature, idealistic helicopter pilot who flies outside of the city on various missions, delivering supplies, searching for oil. On one of his flights he gets stranded in Philadelphia, his only ally a wild child of a 13 year old &quot;cook&quot; named Sadonya. The set up is basically for Berk to get home and of course there are complications. He must deal with the  earths 'survivors' who live outside of the domes, the sweltering heat of the desert even Sadonya and himself. Like I mentioned before N. Lee Wood's writing really inmpressed me mostly because on the surface thius sounds like a Road Warrior rip-off but her descriptions of life on the outside and it's people are vivid making this at times real page turner. I wouldn't call this book entirely science fiction because it seems to be very fact based.  Her description of this post apocalyptic world is very realistic, even brutal at times. Even the characters are 'real' instead of being cardboard cut-outs. The 'realness' of the characters helps and hurts this novel. it helps it because I was for the most part unable to guess what would happen next and even when I did Lee's writing ability held my attention to keep reading. For instance, the fact that Berk the novels &quot;hero&quot; is a selfish, immature and idealisitc. Not the most desirable character traits in a hero. I doesn't make you immediately want to root for him but it make him a believable (real). And Sadonya, a wild child who survives on her own in the harsh outside world. She is brutal, viscious and and cunning. Again traits that are not traditionally found in you heroinnne. But in a realistic world these traits would be essential for survival. It hurts the novel for same reasons that it helps it.  Because  Berk and Sadonya are so close to 'real' it makes it very difficutly to care about what happens to them. I also had problems with the fact that Berk and Sadonya opnely hated one another. It seems as though Lee was trying too hard not to have there be any love or even like interest between them. Unfortunately there is very little to make us really care about them. That aside Faraday's Orphans is still a very compelling read. I enjoyed reading a Science fiction story that is grounded in reality. Although this isn't the kind of novel that a 13 year old will enjoy. It's far too brutal and realistic for kids. I'd recommed it to the discriminating sci-fi reader.	2000-10-11

Writing in flow is not a book about writing by  a writer. It is a book about writing by a psychologist. If you read this  book thinking it's from a writers point of view you may be dissapointed. It  reads a little like a thesis, the author Susan Perry can get a little  academic and reading this book does require a bit of an attention span to  wade through some dull spots.<br />BUT<br />Writing in Flow is a very good on the  verge of great book. It follows groundbreaking work of Mihaly  Csikszentmihalyi. (Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and  Invention)  In writing in Flow Perry through interviews with 75   best-selling and award winning writers and poets to find out what is this  flow thing? How does it work? how do you get there and how long are you  there? The feedback from the writers is the real treat of this book. It's a  real treat to hear how different writers deal with being blocked, or  getting into flow or writing in general. Throught writing in flow perry  gives you lessons what she calls master keys. These master keys are  exercises that are supposed to help you get into the flow of writing. There  are also sections in which writing specific questions are asked to the  author and the author responds. I also found that to be very useful.  Perry's book is extensively researched. There is a notes, section , a  footnotes section there's even an appendix in which she goes into detail   the who, what, when and where of her research.   Another thing that I liked  about Writing in Flow was that the author didn't try to find a one way to  understand and get into flow. Her insights are alot like an good  investagative reporter who not only finds out what she's looking for but  also finds the contradictions. The answers to the who what when where and  how are there but there not as simple as 1-2-3. In  the end there are no  hugeground breaking discoveries about writing although i found a few small  ground rumbling insights.  Not a perfect book but I found this book to be  extrtemely useful. It really helped my look at writing from a different  perspective.  Recommended with little or no reservations.	2000-09-07

Butler and definetely not my last.  The story about a 26 year old black woman , Dana who is suddenly brought  back to the 19th century to continually her white ancestor, Rufus from  death therby ensuring her own exietence. The story is further complicated  by the fact that her ancestor is a slave owner and is very racist. I found  Kindred to be a spellbinding book. Mrs. butler does a fine job at not only  making the story interesting by adding other complications but she also  makes the story flow which makes it hard to put down once you 've started  it. It also asks some very profound questions, the most significant  being  what would you do to survive as a slave?  Kindred was a definete suprise to  me. I expected to read a story that was entertaining but i didn't expect to  read one as thought provoking and profound as it was.	2000-09-01

I  originally heard some of his poetry being on the radio just after his  death. I heard  in the even of my demise and was immediately hooked. I was  estatic when i saw that  his poems were collected in a book.  The rose...  shows you a much different side of Tupac Shakur. One that you don't often   see in the movies or on his records. Tupac was definetely like the James  Dean of rap because he personified the thug persona although with this  collection of poems I'd also compare him to Jim Morrison. What clearly  evedent is that there was so much more to him than simply the thugisms.  It's odd because his poems are so personal and touching it's hard to  reconcile the image of him as this rebel when your reading it. What's also  great about this collection is that there are two version of his poems his  handwritten version are alongside the typed ones. While his poems are not  as polished and refined as other more widely known poets what struck me  profoundly is the sentimens and feeling that is expressed in his words.  This book showed me the complexities of Tupac Shakur, that not only was he  an accomplished raptor (rapper -actor) and hip hop icon he was a very good  poet.   The one poem that stands out in my mind at this moment is  the  almost prophetic in the event of my demise but there are many others that  are equally as touching and sincere. Tupac Shakur was a complex man. It's a  shame that Tupac was taken away before he could fuly relize his full  potential. But fortunately he left with us a body of work that not only is  complex and passionate  but also sincere.	2000-08-21

It is the  production diary in which Spike goes into complete detail how he got she's  gotta have it made. The Diary is from the intitla idea to postproduction.  It's filled with loads of insights into the struggles he was up against. In  fact it's so indepth he even mentiones when his heat and lights go out.

His book Loose balls: is no Ball four, but it definetely is funny and he has some funny and thoughtful  insights  into the NBA of today. This is done in his humorous fashion. Jayson  Williams is a real personality who is not only willing to laugh at the NBA  and it's players but also at himself. I like the fact that he doesn't take  things too seriously and try to stuff his ideas down you throat. What I  also appreciated was his honesty and sincerety something sorely lacking in  a lot of todays atheletes. A funny read.	2000-08-16

I believe dopefiend was his first published book and it feels like it. It's about two middle class kids a couple actually that  get involved in  drugs (heroin). Donald goines striaghforward style and  gritty narrativew fits this story perfectly. And the characters... let me  say this I hope i never run even remotely like into Piggy in my lifetime.   Goines description of him was enough to make my stomach queasy, let along  some of the things he does. Donald goines really had an ear for the street  life. He mad it real. So real at times when I read this book I almost felt  sick reading it. Goines pulls no punches, in fact some of em doubled me  over. (the dogs) Not for the faint of heart. if you are easily offended by  drug use, violence and a story that doesn't end happily this isn't the book  for you.  But if your like me and you enjoy a good story that is  not only  told well  but one that  look a things in a in a different and exciting  way. You'll like this book. This book isn't uplifting but it does teach a  lesson, of sorts street style about what really happens to those who become  involved in the street life. Dopefiend is about as raw and gritty as it  gets. The story isn't a happy but it definetely is a satisfying read.	2000-08-14

That's all I'll say about that without revealing the rest of the plot. But  this is standard Donald goines fare here. Very quick reading an exciting  story and two characters that you really have empathy for. A good quick  enjoyable read that should please Goines fans.	2000-08-14

For these things I found this bok to be a blessing because it  explained a lot of different shots that i didn't know. It also explains  them in a very straightforward manner and sites several movie  as examples.  So why three stars? Mainly for two reasons.  One problem with this bookm is  that it doesn't tell you how to get some shots. ex. various crane shots.  What kind of crane?   Another problem is the fact that the author suggests  you go out buy book on certain subjects say, composition but he doesn't  mention any by name. Overall I did like the very straightforward  explanation of different shots. This is a decent book( not essential) that  film buffs may appreciate more than fimmakers.	2000-07-28

John Ridley's Stray dogs is one of those short, hardboiled books reminescent of a dime store novel from the 30's. It's one of those novels that you either will love or hate. I happened to love it. The chapters and  long on cynicism and short on description and detail. Ridley's writing is  very compact and brief. It feels at times like you are reading a script  because of all of the one word descriptions. It's no coincidence that  Ridley wrote the script to the movie which is almost exactly like the book.  The story is rather simple it's about a drifter whose car breaks down on  the outskirts of a dustbowl town named Sierra and what happes to him in the  24 hrs after. A good read but nothing life altering. John Ridley is a good  writer with a distinct voice. If you are looking for a entertaining read  check  it out.	2000-07-12

I decided to read this novel first because I'd heard many good things about it. So I placed aside my plans to read any of Banks other work until after I finished Rule of the  Bone. Overall I was pretty impressed with Rule... It was a very intriguing  and entertaining if not always completely beleivable read. I really liked  Bone as a character. Banks really did a good job at placing me (the reader)  in the mind of Bone. He really has a good understanding of how teenagers  talk, act and think, although I thinkn the mohawk may have been overkill. I  appreciated his spunk and tenacity, and although he wasn't always the most  likable character I really began to sympathize and root for him. Rule...  folllows Bone (Chappie Chapman) along on his escapades as he is kicked out  of his home, where he live with his alcholic mother and abusive stepfather  as he wanders from upstate new york and eventually finds his way to  Jamaica. For the most part I enjoyed rule... I enjoyed the characters and  banks style for writing this Novel. It's written almost like a confesional.  I mentioned how bans really seemed to really have a handle on characters  especially teenage ones. He also has a good understanding of the jamaican  culture. He has another book set in jamaica called the book of jamaica.  Unfortunately Rule... wasn't always believable once the story shifted  locales to jamaica. While i enjoyed bones observations and advertures while  in jamaica everything didn't always come up plausable. But hey this is  fiction... I still give this book 3.5 stars. Banks prose is very readable  and while it isn't a page turner. It's definetely interesting  read. It  reads like a modern day version of the catcher in the rye. Nothing earth  shattering happens but it still quite journey into mind of a young teen.	2000-06-08

Interesting, disturbing and realistic book, about a man downsized out of his job who winds up doing some disturbing things in order to find the job of his dreams. I really got hooked onto this book, from it's first person  point of view, the detail that he goes through not only to commit his acts  but to conceal them. I also like the fact that the narrator wasn't a total  monster. He's written as a man normal man who only has this alternative. He  also makes you actually have some empathy for the narrator, which makes  this book all the more disturbing. I found myself actually wanting him to  get the job.

Omar does a pretty good job of describing the late 80's fashions  and styles, he also has very readable prose. Some of his insights about the  life of a young Flyy girl were on the nose.

DanielKaufman has compiled 76 different men from all differen races, agesand socio-econimic conditions.  Each of these men write in theri own words what they think it means to be a man. I found this book 10 tems more insightful than any 600 page book written by some so-called expert with a PHD. Extremely insightful, I brought this book a few years ago and I still like to flip through it from time to time.	2000-05-09

Iced is a like being inside the mind of a crack addict. You should know the synopsis by now. It's the life and times of Cornelius Washington, Jr. a 40  year old crack addict and his descent from the bottom to virtual  nothingness.  What makes this book different from the countless other dope  feind books is the style of writing used by the writer Ray Shell. (a real  talent) It's told in diary form, but not in the from of dear diary this  happened, that happened ect... It's like you are inside of Cornelius'  thoughts. You expreience every high he takes you go throught all the highs  and lows throught his life. Not for the faint of heart and spirit, take  caution when reading this book it's addictive, I read three quarters of the  book in the bookstore  before I brought. I finished it that night. It's a  shame that this book is out of print and more people don't know about it  because it's so powerful. I recommed this book highly to anyone who  appreciates great writing.	2000-05-08

I found the teach yourself screenwritng book to be extremely useful in my attempts to write a screen play. This is the first book that really breaks down stories into it's smallles fragments sothat you can understand it.  Throught the book the authour uses the movie Witness as a model story.   What I appreciated about this book is how it explains each and every part  of a story. From the inital idea to the resolution. There is also a handy  appendix section that provides info on scrreenwriting books, magazines,  workshops, organizations, seminars and web sites. Very useful	2000-05-06

Chuck Palahniuk's debut novel Fight Club reads like a movie waiting to happen. Just by reading the  jacket alone gives is reason to know why this book was made into a movie.  (see it) But you might want to read the book first. It's not that the book  gives you something new. It really doesn't. But it does give you a clearer  understanding about the characters. In fact i think the movie was better  than the book. But I'll explain that later. Everyone should know the basic  premise of the book. A young depressed yuppie, whose on relief from his  consumer addicted cubicle life is going to cancer group meetings, meets  Tyler Durden. A wild and loose soap sales man. Thw two start a fight club  for disaffected males. Great premise. The fight club quickly takes on a  life of it's own garnering many mambers from different walks of life.  That's about all that I'll say about the plot.  Palahnuik's style takes  some getting used to. He doesn't write prose like most writers.   Words,sentences, paragraphs ect. He writes more in images. He throws out  tidbits of information at the oddest times. At first I wondered where in  the hell he was going but later I realized (a-ha) I am jack catching on.  The images in some parts are brutal.  There are times in which I felt dirty  even reading what was going on on the page. :) But. You can tell that this  is a first novel. (it's a good one though) It's not very descriptive at  times, leaving a lot left to the imagination. So don't go expecting  everything to completely work itself out.  I found this interesting at time  but frustrating at others. The ending was also rather weak. I was expecting  a little more. Overall I'd definetly recommend Fight club to the right  person. This is not the novel that going to be chosen by Oprah as her book  of the month. It's brutal, cynical, smarmy and un-pc as you will read in a  while and one hell of an interesting read.	1999-10-30
US	51175394	R1UYHH4NFRZ3LI	0393314634	656697230	The Scene (Old School Books)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Black pulp fiction !	In Clarence Coopers The Scene cronicles the lives of several junkies, pushers, cops, thieves that live and die in an unnamed city over the course of several months. The story is told in a pulp fictionesce type of manner  where all of these characters interconnect with one another There is even a  character who dies in the begining that we later find out why. But more  than just being a gimmicky story about crimminals and cops it's more than  that it's about  hope and hopelessness, greed, corruption, ruthlessness,  racism, classism and sexism redemtion and revenge. And it's a murder  mystery of sorts. It sounds like a lot but Cooper keeps all of this afloat  with his stark realistic depiction of street life. His description of a  heroin addicts withdrawl is unflinching, almost too real.  I recomend this  book highly to those who like  black pulpwriters such as Donald Goines,  chester himes but those who like a good hard boiled tale about a world most  us rarely see and most ofetn times want to believe doesn't exist.	1999-10-03

This is simply an excellent book. It thouroughly  chronicles all of Akira Kurosawa's movies. It's chock full of detailed breakdowns of the story, production and post production of all of Kurosawa's films. Let me add that  ALL of Kurosawa's movies are discussed in detail.<br />There is also a section  towards the end in which Kurosawa talks about his philosophy on the  elements of filmmaking. I found this section to be extremely invaluable. I  understand why filmmakers like Steven Speilberg and George Lucas were  influenced by his work. If you love Akira Kurosawas films, this is the book  to get. Do yourself a favor and pick it up.	1999-03-25
