Of course, this isn't just an account of Pol Pot the person, it necessarily has to be an overview of the dreadful Khmer Rouge. It is, in fact, a very gripping read. 450 pages in couple of days. But the author's conclusions are very disturbing. <br /> <br />THere are several questions that ANY book on Pol Pot/Khmer Rouge must answer, and Short does answer them, but not straightforwardly. Let's take a look at some examples of such questions, and Short's answeres: <br /> <br />1.Why did Khmer Rouge take everything to extreme? <br /> <br />a. Because Khmeres traditionally tend to take everything to extremes. <br />b. KR leaders were fans of utopian socialists when they studied in Paris, and were trained by head-strong idealist (but really unpractical and incompetent in real life) students in paris. They just caried it out simplistically. <br />b. Khmeres are notoriously lazy, and they wouldn't work unless they are forced. <br /> <br />2. Why did KR kill so much? <br /> <br />a. Oh, that was not their intention. They just wanted to extract confessions, or to apply strict morale in the party. Everyone just happened to die. <br />b. Because Khmere tradition holds that people never change, any attempts of re-education was never seriously considered. <br />c. KR soldiers were completely uncivilized peasants, and they can't handle complicated stuff. Killing is clear and easy. So they did. <br /> <br />3. Why didn't people revolt to such atrocity? <br /> <br />a. It was Khmere Bhuddist tradition to accept desitiny and authority and fate. <br />b. Khmers didn't have much of a community in the first place, so there were no serious effort <br />c. Every single power in Cambodia was extremely atrocious, including the ancient Angkor, Sihanouk, Vietnamese, etc. So they were used to it. <br /> <br />You see the problem; Short attributes almost everything to the national tendency or cultural tract of Khmer people. In the epilogue, Short says that you shouldn't make such simplistic connections. But, that's exactly what he does throughout the book. In the opening, he cites an example of a very sophisticated and westernized Cambodian Women. She found out that her husband (high ranking official) had a lover, so she got her caught and poured huge amount of acid on her, quietly enjoying the view. Short says, this mentality, where even a decent amount of western education can't tame the cruel and horrible hatred burning behind, is the key to understanding Khmer Rouge atrocity. After reading, I wasn't quite sure how this relates, but Short's message is clear; it's in their blood. <br /> <br />I do have some sympathy with this view, or at least the lure of such an argument. If you did any business in Cambodia, it'll make you want to scream every day. But I think Short yields too easily to that temptation. I also agree with the Washington Post review above. The book often reads like an apology for Pol Pot, which is disturbing. <br /> <br />However, as mentioned, it's a gripping read, and a very good overview of the Cambodian situation in 1960-1990. The whole thing was so byzantine, it was hard to understand who was sleeping with whom. This book does put you in proper perspective (and it tells you that basically everyone was sleeping with everyone at one time or another). Simplistic views that blame a single bad guy (like the US bombardent was THE cause, or Vietnam was cruel, or this and that) will be thoroughly discredited. It's a depressing read, also. Cambodia was always used as a pawn of international po,itics. China, USA, Vietnam, France, and Sihanouk, all lended hands to Khmer Rouge in a direct manner Sihanouk today pretends that he was innocent; No. His incompetent bloody rule sowed the seeds for many of the things to come. I don't know what anyone at any stage could have done to stop any of this.  <br /> <br />But the most frightning part is the lack of depth in Khmere Rouge actions. None of the KR leaders had any practical work experience, much less any ability to plan military operations, build infrastructure, or run a country. As a result, the whole regime simply moves to the most simplistic solution that you could ever devise. For that amount of killing, you'd expect some deep but twisted ideals or conspiracy theories. There aren't any. The whole thing is like a high school play, and its scary.	2005-08-21

The author argues that he has been doing shady stuff as an economic consultant for various aid oranization. Why? Because he was under secret order to promote the advancement of US businesses, and make US into some global empire. <br /> <br />That sounds scary. How did he (and other hit men like him) do this? By swamping the poor countries with debt under the name of aid, so that they would have no choice but to give in to any demand that the US gives. Keep them poor and ignorant and unhealthy, don't allow any good projects that might (god forbid) make them wealthy in any way. <br /> <br />Wow, that sounds really bad. Except...that doesn't seem to advance US business at all! <br /> <br />Think about this. Suppose you are an American business. Say, IBM, GM, Nike, whatever. Which is better for your business, the current Afganistan, or current Malaysia? You can't make sweatshops in Afganistan, or car factories, or anything in Afganistan (no infrastructure, workers are not educated enough). So there's not much exploitation that you could do. You can't sell anything there, because they are too poor. Malaysia, you can do a lot of things. Good infrastructure, relatively cheap and sophisticated labor, somewhat wealthy people that can buy your products and services. <br /> <br />The author argues that he tried hard to keep Afganistan (and other countries) poor, in order to advance US business. But US Business gains nothing from doing that. Yeah, you may be able to bully them around, but what do you get from that? US business (and Japanese, for that matter) would much rather see more Malaysias springing up around the globe. <br /> <br />It should also be pointed out that third world debt hurt US business more than they did the recieving countries. Citigroup really went through tough times with defaulting debts in Latin America during the 1970s. Remember Brazil? If someone owes you 200 billion dollars, they practically own you! Driving the opponent into to heavy a debt is VERYbad business, especially when you can't force them to repay at gun point. <br /> <br />So the whole book is extremely suspicious and unbelievable. Some of the stories are understandable, like people wanting more optimistic economic forecasts. There may be specific cases where you want to crush countries with debt. But not many. The whole thing sounds like an anti-globalist conspiracy day dream, and even as a work of fiction, you'll get bored very quickly.	2005-06-16

History was very unkkind to this woman. Just when she thought she completed here masterpiece, a book that was supposed to ensure her tenure and fame and all the things that a sociologist may want, everything blew up in her face.<br /><br />Her theory in the original version went like this; Why oh why are there huge concentration of functions in Tokyo, London, New York, when so much IT allows easier communication and remote office and all that? Why do these cities grow, when all the production and other functions gets shipped off to backwater countries?<br /><br />Well, she said, IT allowed the separation of production and management/development. That's why managers remain in cities with their high pay, while actual sweat work goes to third world child labor under measly wages.<br /><br />But why did the cities grow bigger? Well, because cities are the new production centers. Management and stuff requires a lot of legal services and accountants and other services etc that are much easily available in the cities. That's why all those management stuff accumulated in the city.<br /><br />But aren't those activites just leeches to the actual job? They don't create any new value, do they? Aha, she says. But they do! Look at all those financial innovations, like hedge funds and derivatives and stuff! Look how much money they are making! They are not leeches, they are creating new values. You gotta throw away your old ideas about the economy! Only cities can produce that sort of new financial products, and that's why London, NY, Tokyo are growing!<br /><br />There was another brownie point. Her theory went very well with shallow anti-globalism arguments. Managers stay in NY/London with high pays, while at the factories half way around the globe, workers suffer forever under low wage.<br /><br />But exactly when the first edition came out, everything changed.<br /><br />First was the collapse of the Japanese economy, that took down Tokyo with it. Her theory had nothing to prepare or explain this. What happened to the new production? What happened to all those financial innovation? Why didn't that work in Tokyo? In the book, Sassen tries to answer this using various ad-hoc excuses, but the more she does it, the less convincing the original proposition becomes. So it wasn't THAT important, after all? All those theories of yours were only subordinate to those other stuff that you never mentioned before?<br /><br />And yes, what about those innovations? Collapse of LTCM and huge hedge funds etc. since the first edition made finance less glamorous. Arbitrage does increase some efficiency of the market, which does create some value. But they were not the major new \\"product\\" to sustain the world.<br /><br />Her theory about the separation of production and management wasn't so hot afterall. Look at Asia, look at China! Concentration of production functions REQUIRED many management and design / development functions to go along with them. Also, the factories did make the workers richer, and as a result, much of Asia and China really became better off. There are dicrepancies, and differences in earnings, but its nothing like what Sassen had described.<br /><br />It's amazing that NOTHING of here original theory remained. In this second version, she tries to pick up the pieces, but they are too completely destroyed to be picked up, and the effort is almost painful to read. I wonder why she even bothered with the second edition. It's not a book worth salvaging in 2001, and it's hardly worth reading, except as a sad but amusing look back at the strange ideas of the past.	2004-09-19

With endorsements from Larry Lessig, Eric Raymond and Bruce sterling, I thought I couldn't go wrong. I discovered that I could. So I got wiser, but not happpy about it.<br />The story is set in a future world, where you \\"save\\" yourself once in a while and reload yourself into a new body when anything goes wrong. It's also a world which is not based on money but on reputation votes (called wuffies). The scary part is that you can check anyone's reputation any time, and people discriminate against you for that. The guy lives in Disneyworld, where it is maintained by volunteers.<br />So Doctrow got his idea from free software development models, and made it into a story, but not too well. For example, the reputation is not supposed to be money but it turns out that if you have high scores, you can actually hire people to do dirty work ... well, then that's effectively money itself. Besides, if you think it out, things are really unclear. I have a high reputation for my translation and Japanese writing skills, but my girlfriend skill sucks. So what's my overall reputation?<br />The attitude toward death is also not well thought out. You can get re-incarnated anytime, so death shouldn't be a big deal...but this guy is very upset because he was killed, and engages in petty sabotage against the person who he thought was behind it. But when the real killer is found, 10 minutes later, he goes on a date with her. What?<br />And then in the end, it kind of implies that the guy sort of tries to embrace the one-time-ness of life, instead of playing clone-reincarnation, but then, it's unclear why, and since he didn't totally give it up, well... so what was the big deal?<br />I'd say the overall writing is shallow, there are interesting motifs but they are not well developed and inconsistent. It's a quick read, sort of mildly entertaining for an hour or so if you have absolutely nothing else to do, but you'd never reread it. If it's free (and there is a free version), well, it's OK, and it's better than stuff on in-flight magazines, but not much.	2003-04-26

Based on the pre-publication blurbs here and there, I thought it may be a simple how-to book without too much theory. The book didn't turn out to be that sort of thing either.<br />This book is, sort of an executive summary of Applied Cryptography (AC), with some updates. It touches upon the insights that Scheneier mentioned in Secret and Lies (like crypto is the easy part and that won't solve security). It mentions some newer material, notably AES related stuff. The description is, in effect, a simplified version of AC. Also, it doesn't try to cover everything, and yes, some explanations about the practical applications are stressed slightly more than in AC.<br />So if you want to be practical, just go over the essential and latest stuff, this is a good book to read. But I must say that it's not as fun to read as AC. Not as many jokes, and absolutely no crazy stuff (like bio-computing and the significance of dark matters). Oh well, maybe that's what being practical means... But it doesn't give you the feeling of throughness that AC gave. Maybe this comes from my reading AC too much in detail (I actually translated the whole book into Japanese), but I think it is inherent in the book itself. In trying to cover as much ground as possible, the book hurries a lot.<br />So if you are in a hurry to cover just enough important stuff, get this book. And if you need some explanation on the newer stuff, get this. But I also recommend getting AC as well.	2003-04-17

This is a totally pointless book, written by a not-so-knowledgeable person. The book describes bunch of cracker attacks, like viruses and trojan horses, DDOS attacks and buffer overflows.<br />He then describes some war zones where information or computer whatever had some role (but then, that would include almost ANYTHING).<br />He does explain why some vulnerability persists. Like the origin of the Internet and Microsoft this and that.<br />But then, he does nothing to properly put it in perspective. He does not have any overview, or anything new to propose. It's just a laundry list and shopping list of various computer security related issues. No ideas on what to do with it, other than the usual &quot;plug your security holes and use caution&quot;.<br />He tries to make them into a big deal by calling it Cyberwar and Cyberterrorism. But there's hardly any mention of military action aspect. Yeah, the army may have a web site, or you may re-write a web site. But that's hardly war. Basically, it's just your normal computer security issues. And the author is not particularl knowledgeable in this area. So why bother to read it, when you can read books by REAL experts like Bruce Schneier?<br />And the final conclusion reads;<br />&quot;If you do all you reasonably can to keep your PC safe, there's no point in getting upset if something nasty hits you anyway. Forwhatever gets to you under those circumstances is probably hitting a lot of other people and Web sites.&quot; (p.264)<br />... and this guy is supposed to be some expert on war. So if everybody else gets bombed, you shouldn't be upset when you are bombed? How interesting. No, this is clearly not how you should think about security, or &quot;war&quot; or &quot;terrorism&quot;.<br />Besides, if all you have to do is to do some normal security stuff (like patch your security holes, use anti-virus software) to be happy under what the author calls &quot;cyberwar&quot; and &quot;cyberterrorism,&quot; why did the author even bother to go through all this scare and fear-mongering? <br />So, to summarize, the problem is disorganized, its description is second rate, and there's no real solution or proposal --- now that's what I call pointless. Don't bother.	2002-10-31

I'd say this is a bad case of over-research or losing objectivity. It's a formidable work that he's put in. He has interviewed numerous top officials in the Bank of Japan, Ministry of Finance and Politicians to dig into the current Japanese recession. But the conclusion that he draws is as follows;<br />  a. BOJ were under pressure, so they couldn't do anything.<BR>  b. MOF was busy, and they had no other choice.<BR>  c. Politicians had other interests, so they weren't available.<br />  d. So, there was nothing that could have been done (or could be done in the future) to avoid (or get out of) the Japanese recession.<br />Now, this is meaningless. Of course everybody has some excuses if you ask them. I guess the Nazis had their reason for their gas chambers, too, and most of them \\"couldn't do anything.\\" Stalin would have said he had no other choice. But should we just say \\"oh well\\" and let it go? I don't think so. What has happend, happened,  but one point of thinking about history is to figure out the options that might have been taken to prepare for future situations. This book doesn't do that, it simply justifies the status quo.<br />This often happens when you get to close to the subject and sympathize too much.<br />His attitude is apparent in his arguments about the inflation targetting argument proposed by Krugman (and almost every other economist right and left). He discribes that BOJ can't do it, the current law doesn't allow it. Well, who said BOJ has to do it alone? But Grimes never even thinks about any possiblity of changing the present, or the possible merits that it would bring IF it happened.<br />That's the limit of this book. Three stars for the considerable research effort, but this is a result of much perspiration and no inspiration. <br />Oh, and next time, get a better caligrapher for the cover.	2002-08-15

The pages are obviously printed out by an inkjet printer or something (you can actually see some jaggies in the font), and the index is created by MSWord indexing menu, which has multiple entries of the same item, and the way he indexes whole phrases makes it very hard to look up.<br />It's contents are extremely repetitive. You'll see the same ideas and examples expressed over and over and over and over again, in almost exact same wording. With proper editing, this book would have become 1/3 the volume that it is. The ideas are interesting, although some part, like his suggenstion that the US government should engage in industrial spying, seems questionable. Also, when he uses the word &quot;Open Source&quot;, it's not the open source that the people in the software community is used to, so be careful. But it's a book worth skimming through.	2002-07-20

I was looking forward to this (I look forward to almost anything from Krugman and Stiglitz), but my impression of this new Stiglitz text is rather negative.<br />As an introductory text book, it's not bad. Covers all the important points of micro and macro. However, I was rather dissapointed that the text book emphasises \\"the new economy\\" caused by IT. It has all these \\"e-Insights\\" and \\"e-Cases\\" in all of the chapters, to show how IT is affecting the economy in fundamental ways.... only, is it? After the fall of dot.coms in 2000, I would have expected a more reserved approach, to say the least, not just all these IT glorifications. Especially from Stiglitz, the champion of the economics of information, I didn't imagine such \\"oh the Internet is great\\" attitude. Such as; \\"lowering search costs, the Internet holds out the promise of vastly increasing the efficiency of labor markets.\\" (p.313) Really? I thought the lessons of the dot.com crash was that when people say \\"enormous\\" or \\"vastly\\" about IT benefits, you should ask \\"how enourmous/vast?\\" This text book doesn't do that. \\"Today, with virtually instantaneous information on sales, production and inventories, managers gan fine tune their production levels, avoiding the types of fluctuations seen in the past.\\" (P.777) Theoretically, yes. But that didn't materialize too well, did it. But no comment on that. It devotes significant pages (well, 4, but with so much ground to cover, this is quite a lot to the history of personal computers and the Internet (pp.6-10). Nice story, but how does that tie in to the theme of economics? The book offers no connection! It's supposed to give an overview of the issues in Economics, but it's not a particulary good one (this industry is a bit peculiar, you know.)<br />I just hope the undergrads using this text book doesn't start another IT bubble.<br />On the good side, Stiglitz's experience at the World Bank has a lot of positive effect. The parts aboutdevelopment aid and globalization is strong (although short, but hey, this is only introductory). It's readable and understandable (but I'm in Japan; compared to the cranky jargon-laden econ textbooks here, most American textbooks are sweeter than candy). It's treatment of inflation is rather deep, which is nice. Emphasis of the environmental issues are, well, a bit bent toward the \\"Litany\\" (see Lomborg \\"Skeptical Environmentalist\\" on this), but it's good to see that they are given some explanation.<br />All in all, it's not as good as I expected, but still very good and strong. I might say that grabbing the 2nd edition (which is getting real [inexpensive] now...) might offer more U (utility) for your buck.	2002-05-22
US	53084434	R6O6SY9167J3	0738204080	818061203	Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices	Books	3	42	45	N	N	It never happened to me, and I don't think it'll work.	I've been a fan of Chris Locke/RageBoy for quite a while. His attacks on Internet marketing gurus, those stupid know-it-alls on e-whatever, has been great, and had me rolling on the tatami (I'm in Japan).<br />This book sums up his criticism, and tries to come up with a remedy of his own, which he calls gonzo marketing. But, I'm very sad to say that his arguments doesn't hold water.<br />What he proposes is a very zen kind of thing; if you want to sell products on the Net, then you should not think of selling it (because if you think about it, people will sense that you are a sales person, and would despise you). Just be as you are. If you are active online without ever mentioning your product, then someone would notice that you work for such and such company, and people will come to you. Do not seek sales, and the sales would seek you out.<br />Based on this theory, he proposes that firms should allow employees to enjoy net surfing and engage in news group discussions on payed time. They won't be forced to make any sales or do any sales pitch. Just be sincere, and then, when people encounter some problems with a certain product, it might pop into their minds; \\"hey, that guy works for this company! Maybe he can help me!\\" And then you'll have a lead!<br />Now, this sounds nice (as an employee myself). Hey, I can waste time on the web all day and get paid! But if you have been active on the Net, you should step back and think. For example, I've been so-so active on the net, participating in Linux and other user groups and discussions. In Japan, I'm a pretty famous online presence. Now, has anyone contacted me about my professional business (I'm a consultant in the road and power sector)? Has anyone inquired me about the projects and services of my firm?<br />Not once.<br />Let's think the other way around. Has it ever occurred to me of asking my online friend Mr. W, who works at NTT (the Japanese telecom giant) to give me advice on the selection of my calling plans? Never.<br />If my experience is of any indication, I must conclude that the Locke/Rageboy's Gonzo Marketing proposition is false. It does not happen.<br />The fact is, I really don't want this sort of thing to happen. I want my online presense to be a private thing. And I don't want to deal with someone with some hidden (or explicit) corporate agenda on his/her mind. Even if you are NOT explicitly required to make any sales pitch, a sales lead IS desirable than not having one, and that motivates people to make subconscious distortions to make subtle sales pitches. He says that there can be an iron wall between the content and the sale department. We all know how well THAT works.<br />His logic is often screwy. He tries to fool the readers by mixing 2 claims: that the broadcast model is dead everywhere, and the broadcast model is dead on the Internet. He claims that there is no mass market on the Net, so in order to get the market share, they have to go for the numerous micromarkets through gonzo marketing. But when he talks about market shares, is he talking about market shares in general, or just the market shares on the Net? Maybe, it just means that firms should forget about net marketing altogether, and focus on TV. How important is the net market anyway?<br />His over reliance on mushy sentimental rethoric is often annoying. Also, he never shows us that the gonzo marketing model actually works. All he mentions is that he wrote funny clever zines which the readers loved (or some big shot praised). Did it really lead to any sales for the sponsor companies? He never tells. In one rare occasion, he notes that Harry Potter series have elicited over 10,000 reader reviews, and he says that the worth of these reviews (which represents a conversation within a micromarket) is apparent by the fact that Harry Potter part5 is already the #1 best seller. But... that's not entirely due to the reviews, is it? That's not any proof.<br />And Amazon encouraging reader reviews is vastly different from GM infiltrating an organic gardening site in the hopes that some one may mention something about cars (that's the gonzo proposition). A bookstore wanting people to talk about books is understandable. A GM sleeper lurking at an organic gardening site...that really creeps me out. And I don't think that's sincere or truthful. Maybe she IS really interested in organic gardening, but still, people would feel awkward talking about cars there. It won't be the same. And before you know it, you'll have to start suspecting everyone.<br />The book has its good moments. The Internet being a market in the old sense, a place for conversation and interaction, is nice and interesting (as it was in \\"Cluetrain\\".) But as a whole, I can't really see his ideas flying. It was great while he was ranting. But when he tried to compose it into some rational theory that makes sense, well... it doesn't make any sense. And trying to make sense sort of spoiled the irrational crazy energetic fun part that made it gonzo.<br />I'm giving the book 3 stars, because it is a good read on what's wrong with Internet marketing today. His proposals are, well, a good try, better than most other books that I've read, but falls way to short to actually work, IMHO.	2002-05-03

If you just came around after reading his vintage masterpieces, such as Sirens of Titan or God Bless You Mr. Rosewater or Cat's Cradle or whatever, and expect to find more of those sad but hilarious but deeply moving stories here, don't. You'll be dissapointed.<br />The book is a collection of interviews with dead people by Mr. Vonnegut. All of them are about 2-3 pages long (and those are pages with very large margins). Vonnegut cannot sustain the power in his writing, resorts to some small talk and just leaves without really making much of a point (except for something like &quot;Oh, life is generally OK&quot; sort of remark) in any of them.<br />This seems to have been a CD, which might have worked. But not in a book form. If you are a really royal fan of Vonnegut who would even praise his shopping list, then you might enjoy it and actually call this a masterpiece, as some of the reviewers here have done. But if you are like me who loved his earlier works but thinks that his recent works really lacks steam, you would probably feel that this is another of his rather steamless recent works. There are some moments that are...so so moving, or so so funny, but they really don't hold together as a whole.	2002-03-28

This is a catalog of WSB's shotgun paintings and non-shotgun paintings, with Timothy Leary writing text. WSB wrights a small piece, and Tim Leary writes some essay about... well, his usual upbeat-but-not-quite-coherent stuff. It's rather bad writing, I have to say. Tim Leary was suffering Alzheimers, and this was probably written right before his death, so you shouldn't expect any master pieces, but even with that low expectation, it's still bad.<br />The designer must have understood that, and tries to save the book by overdesigning Leary's text. A huge font here, totally covering the page, and then just some in the corner... Good try. However, you can't shake the impression that it's cheaply made.<br />So if you are a huge fan of WSB or Leary or Weissman (you must be, if you are even READING this at all!), you might want to have it.

First, the contents; This is an &quot;in memorium&quot; book. It contains 5 (but rather short) interviews with WSB, and an unpublished intro that WSB wrote for a Grove Press catalog. That takes about 40 pages of a 163 page book. The rest is tributes to WSB by various minor writers and artist.<br />The interviews are not anything spectacular. WSB is not a person that gives new insight like potato chips. He repeats the same thing over and over again, so most of what he says in the interviews, you've probably already read somewhere. All the interviewers are rather ... 2nd rate, most have no idea how to develop a theme, and they just slide along from one topic to the next, only scratching the surface everywhere.<br />The tributes are, there are about 40 of them altogether, and all of them are unimpressive.<br />So, as I said in the text, you can skip this unless you are a fanatic like myself (and even this fanatic was not very enthusiastic when this came through the mail). But since it does contain WSB material that you can't find anywhere else, If you GOT to have it all, go for it.	2002-01-28
US	53084434	RSHR2586GELSL	0940322676	450794803	A Handbook on Hanging	Books	4	12	17	N	N	Well, it's wry british humor against capital punishment	This is a great manual if you want to hang yourself; you know, amatuers simply strangle and suffocates to death, but that's not how the pros do it. The proper way to do it is to drop enough distance so that you break your neck, and then you don't want to drop TOO far because your neck would fall off (that's ugly, you know).  To achieve this, a hangman has to know exactly how long the rope is, and how heavy the extra weight should be, and other huge knowledge base. In fact, it's more an art, because capital punishment doesn't do any good, no one's allowed to see it, it's stigmatized, and its there as an absolute pure art. Now, why don't we put more use to it? Why not make it into the nation's favorite TV show? If the court channel is so popular, imagine what a hit your Execution channel would be!<br />The book goes through all of this in your typical British Humor, and it's great. And if you are smart, you'd realize that this book is actually a book against capital punishment, backed with figures and facts. I myself is not against the death penalty, but the book does make you think. Great book.<br />Don'd read the preface by this whoever, though. It is boring and just plain stupid PC, and it makes you not want to read the book at all. It doesn't have any sense of humor, it tries to push the same ol' conclusions in a hastly manner, a real disgrace. Rip it out. Just go for the actual thing! If it hadn't been for this, I would have gave the book 5 stars.	2001-12-23

The procedure and the idea behind Japanese bath taking is clearly explained, without the oft-found orientalism. This is exactly the bath taking manners that our parents teach their kids (well, at least they are supposed to).<br />Another great point about this booklet is the artist, Maruo.  He is the Dario Argento of Japanese comics, known for his extremely detailed and beautiful drawings of the grotesque. In this book, you'll find a lot of very pleasant drawings about Japanese bath taking, but to the people who are used to his normal works, you sort of expect some blood, gore, beheadings and freakshows that are Maruo's signature themes at every turn of the page.  Whether that expectation was satisfied was... I'll leave it up to you to find out.<br />Highly reccomended. Informative to non-Japanese (and the younger generation Japanese --- you kids have no idea how to properly take a bath these days, shame on you), and enjoyable to Japanese.	2001-11-13

Period.  <br />The only regret that I have about this tape is that WSB is quite old when he read this. The story itself is intelligent and detailed, but it has a definite feel of a work told/written by a young person who is still active. While WSB's voice remains amazingly consistent over the years, the reading of this tape comes through as apparently older than the man telling the story. I can't quite explain, but te core of the voice seems a bit wobbly than his earlier readings.<br />But it's still great. WSB's monotonous voice really conveys the not-so-pleasant contents very well. And If you want his voice to fill the room for a very long time, well nothing else comes close. ...	2001-07-23

But when he turns to proposals for the future, he fails miserably.<br />He starts out by saying that he wants to provide a vision of the future that's not Market-is-everything and not communism, but something more realistic, which he calls &quot;Utopostics&quot;. OK, that sound nice. So what is it?<br />He has no idea. He just says &quot;we should try to make things more democratic and more equal and nice, and then probably we'll get to somewhere better, although I don't know what it is.&quot; Oh.<br />And he proposes some efforts of equality, which is plain stupid. He says that for hiring people for any position, the existing various exams and qualification tests are there to maintain the status quo and prolong discrimination, so we should abandon it. And we should replace it with... get this, draws. &quot;When you want to hire 30 people out of a 100, it's not right to evaluate and rank qualifications, because the guys with the 30th score and 31st score doesn't have significant differences, so it's not rational to hire one and forego the other,&quot; he says. &quot;So let's take 3 from the top, discard the bottom 3, and ther rest should draw straws. This would make the world more equal.&quot; ... He's joking, right? Wrong. He's dead serious. He thinks this is better. Well, maybe it's more equal, but would it make a better selection? Do I want to trust people who just drew straws? Not really.<br />  His other proposals are equaly nuts and totally unrealistic. And in the end, he tries to justify his inability to provide the vision for the future by citing chaos theory, saying that it's actually impossible to predict anything. Ah, if you are going to weasle your way out like that, don't even try to write this sort of book.  And for all you potential readers out there, save your time and money. You'll learn nothing here.	2001-06-15

So, this book tries to start off by saying that &quot;Ah, we knew that all along!&quot; and then trying to sell the existing industries the IT gospel.<br />That's a hard position to maintain, and I think the book suffers from it. It resorts to saying that use of IT is crucial for existing firms, but the thing it offers is almost exactly the type of things that were touted in the pre-Internet days, where Toyoda excelled with JIT systems, Kao used their IT advantage, 7-11 improved logistics by streamlining their suppliers... in short, what people used to call &quot;strategic use of information systems&quot; in those days.<br />So, after all these Internet things, we're back to where we were 10 years ago, and the authors try to make it sound new, but it isn't.<br />Another problem is their style. The authors says that in order to prevent the book from becoming outdated within a month, they have avoided placing case studies, and focused on the philosophy.  But, this makes the whole book into a collection of general ideas, things that anyone can say, things  you already read in Harvard Business Review or Businessweek a hundred times.  They resort to a lot of quotes from zen or Buddha, or some folk story to make themselves sound profound. I don't  know how it reads to an American, but for a Japanese like me, they stink.  Since they don't site actual cases, they use only tiny newsbits to illustrate the point, and you really don't get the whole picture. They say things like,  &quot;When firm A uses US $3 billion for purchases, if IT can reduce that cost by only 1%, that's significant!&quot; but they never show whether that 1% saving is likely to happen!!<br />I also have to question their competence in judging technology, They claim that Sega dropped out of the game console business, because their Dreamcast console didn't adopt DVD. I seriously doubt that. Show me a game that uses the full capacity of DVD effectively. I don't think the authors understand the game console market, or the relation between technology and the market acceptance.<br />Nice try, and there are some interesting points in the book.  Also, my general disapproval of these management guides probably have a lot to do with this not-so-good review.  But I can't say I'm very happy with this book.	2001-04-29

The problem with this book is that the setting has almost nothing to do with the plot or character. So it's an orwellian world. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, all susupicious moves are screened out by pattern matching and suspects are immediately identified.<br />And then, the special unit named PEACE will nail the suspect using a tranquilizer gun. The city became safer, less crimes. Fine.<br />You would imagine that this sort of setting would lead to an Orwellian dystopia, where people's freedom is compromized under a police rule.  No.  The only problem is that  there is some side effects with the tranquilizer and the hero goes after it. and then he uncovers this huge conspiracy...<br />But even after everything is revealed, I can't really understand the problem. So why not use another tranquilizer??! That's all there is to it.  Everything else about this system, according to this story, is just peachy.  Really?<br />The story avoids all difficult issues about this sort of setting, and just does this tough  good guy (with a beautiful wife) against a big conspiracy.  I don't think the characters  and the plot are well worked out. He devotes a chapter about a news reporter's past,  you think he's an important character, but he doesn't do ANYTHING. Why bother? The final battle seen, where somehow, the major characters come together, is totally unbelievable.<br />I regret the time I spent on this story.  I wouldn't want other people to repeat that waste.	2001-04-29

I knew that he was a so-called &quot;relativist&quot;, and so I was rather skeptic about his writings. So,  I was rather surprised to find a clear and reasonable discussion about a lot of things in this book. The position of the liberal left in America, and its relation with the labor union movement...<br />So I liked it, and I think I understand his position to an extent. He says that we should stop pretending that there is a &quot;reality&quot; beyond what we feel and experience.  We should stop dreaming that there is some &quot;truth&quot; out there that we have to find. He says that we should try to do things that promote freedom and democracy, and we shouldn't do things for the sake of some ideal or some image of a perfect world that should eventually be achieved.<br />That's all very fine, except....<br />If there is no ideal, if there is no fixed value, then how does he justify his faith in democracy and freedon? Why are these ideas unquestionably good? <br />Also, he says that pursuing science and stuff just for the sake of it, cannot be justified. Western science is not pursuing the absolute truth about this world. It is a really good thing, but only because  it was usefull to us so far. (But since it was VERY useful, people who praise voodoo magic and folk &quot;science&quot; as something equally great as western science are plain stupid, since those things were very limited in their scope of usefullness). And so, we can't justify stuff like super colliders or space exploration, since it's usefullness to democracy and freedom are questionable.<br />Well... how the hell would anybody know what would be good for what purpose? People who were looking for big prime numbers probably had no practical use of those theories in mind.  Yet, today, they are quite useful in cryptography... which is probably good for freedom in many ways. A lot of scientific discoveries had no practical use, and so was not useful in any sense at that time.  And there were many projectsthat was supposed to improve the world that didn't do anything.<br />It's a good book, and the writing is clear and sometimes even fun.  You will understant Rorty's ideas, and its a great introduction.  But it's an introduction that makes you think.  I don't know if the  answers to my questions (and undoubtedly, many other people would have thought about the same thing, since I'm not the brightest person on earth) are in his other writings, although I doubt it.	2001-04-28

It was quite an amazing book.<br />First, Lessig argues that commerce and the government will try to turn Internet into a regulable place, and in order to do so, they will rely on changing the code (or protocol) of the Internet.<br />Now, regulation through code is problematic, because it is TOO good. If its a law or some regulation, you can intentionally choose to disobey it, or rebel against it.  With code, you can't do that. He says that this is bad, because a lot of good things in this world depend on the fact that you can't enforce certain laws too strictly. That's where some part of freedom relies on.  If regulation becomes too strict, we're doomed.<br />So, we have to do something about it.  We have to force people to create &quot;incomplete&quot; code!! This is the very surprising conclusion of this book.  You really should read this, because it sounds too crazy at first glance.<br />And then, the book becomes even better. He starts discussing who would actually take the trouble to do that kind of thing. And he starts discussing how we should restore the democratic process, and how we are in a process of becoming a world citizen!<br />It's a book with an amazing scope, dealing with much more than the title suggests. And it's not just some sort of a fairy tale, it's a problem that's facing us as we speak. A lot of people talk about the Internet changing the world, when all they actually talk about is making some petty cash. Not this book. This book will persuade you that the Internet WILL and IS really changing the world.  After this book, you're Net crawling will never be the same.	2001-04-28

It's not too technical, and he provides a very readable and understandable explanation to his approach, which also reaches beyond just design issues, but more of the state of civilization in the 21st century. And of course, this book itself reflects his ideas of design, so you literary see what you read. Too bad you can't carry this book around...<br />One thing. On my visit to a design book store, I realized that this book has several versions of cover.

It spends only about 20 pages on his linguistics. Very shallow, scratch the surface kind of description, stuff that anybody who would bother to read a beginner's guide would know already.<br />Instead, this book focuses on Chomsky as a social commentator. But the explanation on his Political ideas is poor. You will learn that Chomsky says that, the world is controlled and dominated by big companies and people are manipulated by media illusion, and that the government doesn't serve the people but only protects the interest of these companies. OK. I would say they contain some amount of truth. But this all sound like very familiar leftist political statement. What was Chomsky's contribution in all this? The book never gives you any idea. Or are we to admire the fact that he dares to say these things at all? (I suspect that this is what the authors are getting at...)<br />I would imagine that this is the fault of the authors, and not Chomsky himself. The interview at the end of the book is kind of telling. The interviewer keeps asking stupid touchy-feely Qs like &quot;Do you feel positive about the future?&quot; and you can clearly observe that Chomsky is really annoyed by this. To summarize, this a sort of an exploitation book, an attempt by a soft-headed liberal to create a cult of personality out of Chomsky. The depiction of Chomsky as a Superman on the cover clearly indicates this, I think. Now, does Chomsky deserve this? This sort of blind worship is the last thing that the man would want.	1999-10-28

She talks about &quot;globalization&quot;, yet never shows exactly what she means by this, and most of her arguments rely on anecdotes. <br />   Her argument goes like this; There's more overseas production, there are huge multi-nationals, and there's an international capital market, and then there are international issues that goes beyond the national boundaries. Therefore, the sovereign nation is losing power.<br />   While these are all true, the most important question is; to what extent? She never adresses this, and so, the whole book amounts to not much than some trendy talk of &quot;Oh the world is global now and everything's different&quot;. So, forget this book.
