Geneva, divorced mother of a teenage son, tells the story of her three friends, Noah Crystal and Chevy.  It is sitcom funny. They fight and get into some crazy situations - Chevy gets arrested, Noah's funny experience on the subway with an unknown woman, Weight watcher's group, and many more.<br /><br />The story was so enjoyable because we all know people like this.  You are rght there with them through every crazy thing that they do, laughing, crying and calling them a name or two.  My hats off to Geneva Holliday.

I respect Dr. Shabazz and the way she raised her children.  Growing up in this society is difficult.  I can not imagine how she took on the task of explaining why their father could not come home or how to explain the impact he had on the entire country. Dr. Shabazz raised her girls as queens.  Unfortuneately many of us had to learn those lessons later. Ilyasah couragously gave readers a glimps into the lives of the Shabazz family and a little of her growing pains.  She learned from her sister Attallah that she was already that daughter of Malcolm X, she did not have to prove anything to anyone.  She had to find her own self.<br />I recently attended a book signing and Ilyasah was humble, warm, friendly, beautiful and then some.  I loved the way she chatted with my 6 year old, who attended the signing with me. I have, in the same way that Dr. Shabazz started to teach him of his origins and his greatness.  She also pointed out simple things about her parents that I never thought of.  I loved that way the story started with her father's death and ended with her mother's death.  I cried from beginning to end.  I am also glad that she did not go into detail about her nephew...(some things should stay within the family).<br />Thank you Ilyasah for sharing a little of your life's story with us.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings!!	2002-06-21

Let me be  first to say &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot;.  I read 100 pages in a few hours.  This is a coming of age, love story that takes on a very indept look at the life of Eric Brown.  It was funny, true to life and at times over the top (but that does not mean that it could not happen) and romantic.<br />Alex's writing is clever and to the point.  He does not waste a lot of time telling you the story eventhough sometimes I think he give you too much information (I liked the vacation on the island but I did not need that detail explainaion of the room decor).  For his first novel, I think that Alex has written a very clever book that is different from a lot of the other stories that we are reading. I thought the poetry was really good.  My personal favorite is &quot;BLACK&quot;.  Once you met Alex, his appeal will no doubt convenience you that the book is worth reading.<br />And speaking of covers- The illustration was made by his teenage son! That is very impressive.<br /><br />Congratulations Again Alex!! I look forward to your next novel from BET books.<br />Peace and Blessings!!	2002-04-05

First, he shows the readere that drugs addicts were not born that way, they are real people.  The lives of Leory, Pookie, Black, Clarisse, Butter and Rock are real and we all see these people everyday. Second, there is always corruption in EVERYTHING. No matter how many good guys there are, the bad still outnumbers them; yet good always prevails. (At least I like to hope so) Third, there is always a struggle for the African American man to simply be men in this society with so much negitive.  Finally, Love is always present.  Despite the horror and their need to find that same &quot;high&quot;, they had love for each other and they fought for each other.<br />Jones' novel was full of suspense, horror, and chills.

The characters are funny and smart and Linday remembers to include just enough sex-appeal but not too much that it takes away from the suspense.<br />This story was funny, and full of action.  It was really a quick read but you will not want it to end, which will shock you in more than one way.<br />In the words of David's friend Rick, &quot;Look-a-here&quot;...you must read this novel. (^_^)<br />Peace and Blessings!!	2001-10-05

I recently watched the movie &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; with Gregory Peck and realized that I had never read the book. I was really anticipating reading the movie. Yet, I gained a lot more. The story written by Harper Lee is MASTERFUL. Her word use keep me in the dictionary but I was amazed at how much I wanted more. The adventures of Jem and Scout were priceless and they always taught a lesson. For instance, Jem and Scout thought their father, Atticus, was boring and unlike other fathers until with a single shot he killed a &quot;mad dog&quot;. Lee's vivid and clear description of the events made you simply want more. The story that began with simple childhood couriosity quickly changed to the evils of racial discrimination and prejudices. Jem and Scout learned a lot about themselves, their father, racism, and most of all - Always treat people the way you want to be treated!<br />Peace and Blessings!	2001-09-06

If you ever wanted to know what goes on behind closed doors in the church, you must read this book. Theophilus was a promising paster.  He was also SINGLE.  Theophilus was being hunted down by every single female in his church.  I could not beleive the things some women would do to become FIRST LADY of a church.  But Essie Lee Lane proved to be his soul mate and capable of dealing with all of the want-a-bees in the church.  I would not want her job on a bad day.<br />The characters were funny and you will laugh out loud more than once. (Especially when the Bishop's teeth falls out - or when Essie sticks the woman in the butt with her hat pin) The story proved that religious men are just like any other men.  It is the congregation that puts these religious men on such high pedestals and then they forget what their real purpose is within the church.  CHURCH FOLK should be a required reading for those that want to go into the ministry as well as the congregations.  Sometimes people do not realize how much they are acting foolish until they see it in black and white.<br />Ms. Bowen .... Excellant.  I can't wait to read your next book!<br />Peace and Blessings !	2001-08-23

Well this is kind of what happens in &quot;Just Say No&quot;.  John Williams was the high school nerd, who always stayed to himself, played in the band, had only one friend, D. Harmon, had an overprotective mother, and you know the rest.  John was like many teenagers, who also wondered about his missing father.  Then he surprises everyone at school and enters the college talent show.  The rest, shall we say is history.<br />&quot;Just Say No&quot; vividly describes what happens to John as he embarks on a singing career.  Tyree candidly describes in great detail, John's introduction to drugs, groupies, death and his own self destruction.  The story is told by John's closest friend and manager, Darin Harmon.  Darin, on the other hand, was very popular football star but after an injury he decides to help make sure his friend gets established in the music industry.  Darin has a great business mind and realizes that he has given up his dream to help his friend.<br />Tyree has written a very good story.  It really puts that reader in the middle of everything as it happens.  However, there were a few points when the story just seemed to drag or when I thought Tyree had given too much detail.  Yet, once you got the end of the story, you were satisfied.  I really enjoyed the way Omar kept the events of the story current with the music industry of today. (It really made me wonder whether this was based on someone that we currently know in the industry...Hmmmmm) Hats off to Omar... Great story!<br />Peace and Blessings!!	2001-08-07

Plenty.  Harris has once again given his readers another breath taking story.  After the wedding disaster, you would assume that Basil and Yancy went on with their lives.  Well sort-of... Yancy is off to become a successful recording star.  Yet, her #1 song has some very questionable lyrics.  (and the CD was great... try to find a copy if you have not had the chance to hear it)  Basil's sporting agency is growing and he also seems to be more mature, but he is still the same old Basil... and that is where Bart Dunbar comes in. Bart is a struggling model/actor who falls in love with Basil at first site. (or so he thinks)  Once Basil turns him down, all hell breaks loose.  And then he meets up with Ava, Yancy's mother, and then your mouth drops at all that happens.  But I think you will be surprised at the way the story ends....<br />This story will make you laugh out loud but also as all of Harris stories, you also end up wanting to cry for someone.  Returning to the story are Yancy's old roommate, Windsor and Raymond. There are several new characters, one that kind of reminded me of Kyle from  &quot;Invisible Life&quot;.  I believe there is still more to come from all of these characters.<br />I love E. Lynn and his stories.  My only regret is that I read them so fast.  I can't wait till he visits Baltimore for his book signing.  Peace and Blessings!!	2001-07-16

After I read the first 10 pages, I went Whoa!!!!! I discovered it was also hot!  I started to read this book on the subway to work and missed my stop - twice.  Needless to say I did not get much work done that day.<br />It is the story of Jada and Wellington.  They were so much in love or was it really lust.  Wellington was the typical man who did not and could not read between the lines of what was going on around him.  Jada makes a lot of bad decisions that proved to have a great impact on her for the rest of her life.  And wait until you meet Wellington's mother.  She made Ava, from &quot;Not a Day Goes By&quot; by E. Lynn Harris seem like a mouse.<br />All in all you will find this a very interesting story. Great Job Mary.  Peace and Blessings!!	2001-07-05

Mosley introduces readers to two new characters, Paris Minton and Fearless Jones. Paris is a bookworm. He states that he fell in love with books when he was told by a white libraian that he could never read any of the books in a local library. Fearless is a war vet, who is sweet, compassionate and as you would guess,he is fearless of death.<br />By the time you reach page 5, all hell has broken erupted. Elana Love walks into Paris' bookstore and she brings plenty of trouble. She is looking for a church congregation that suddenly disappears in the night because the alleged Rev. has a bond that is worth a lot of money. As a result, Paris is beat up and his store is burned down. He turns to his long time friend, Fearless, for help after bailing him out of jail. As the two travel the streets of L.A. to find Elana, they meet Fanny and her husband, Sol. Fanny is funny, brave and caring. Then there is Leory, The Rev., and many others who will make you laugh out loud. Paris turns out to be a great detective as he tries to unfold the mysteries that Elana has set in motion. If you love Easy Rawlings and Mouse then you will definately love these new characters. Like all of Mosley stories, it was a page turner with many twist and turns. You will not want to put it down.

Jessica Wolde, whom we met in &quot;My Soul to Keep&quot;, is trying to come to grips with the death of her daughter, Kira, and the new life that she has to deal with, immortality.  The question that continued to come to her mind was &quot;Why?&quot;  To make matters more complicated, she gives birth to Bee-Bee or Fana who is able to control the weather, read her mind and enters her dreams.  She is scared.<br />Then there is Lucas, who will do almost anything to save his son. Even if it means leaving his son on his death bed to travel to Bostwana for this unknown cure.<br />&quot;The Living Blood&quot; will make you hold your breath from beginning to end. It is a story that makes your question your own beliefs of loyalty and humanity. Ms. Due has written another excellant novel. I just hope that there will be a sequal. (be cautious of the Bee cave and wait until you find out who the Mummy-like character really is) Peace and Blessings!	2001-06-15

Rick, Gina and Sydney all had to deal with very difficult issues - spousal abuse, child abuse and marriage - and the most difficult family problem that they had to face together was their mother's brain tumor.  They had to find a way to work and support each other.  Delores was the most courageous character.  She dealt with her tumor through her faith in God and emonstrate her devotion to her family and her efforts to keep them together through the same faith.<br />This story was filled with love, compassion  and faith.  I cheered when Gina finally found a way to leave her husband, Phillip. Gina was the most difficult character to read about because I have witnessed women in this type of abuse relationship and no matter how much you try it is just difficult. Syndey dealt with numerous problems from being the oldest with the most responsiblity, to feeling that that she had to be strong to protect the others.<br />I lovd this story.  I read it in 8 1/2 hours. It is definately a must read...	2001-05-11

I had the pleasure of meeting Parry Brown at a book signing in May of 2000, when she was self published this book.  Just from the meeting, I knew that she was a woman with a story to tell.  I had to buy a new book because I had loaned my book to several co-workers and the book was starting to look worn.<br />This is Terry's story.  He loved his children and he worshipped Catherine.  Terry put the needs of his children before anything else. Nevertheless, he was able to see Catherine for the person that she really was.  Brown's detail account of the meeting between Terry and Jackie was breathtaking. (If only it could happen in real life-but it problable has) Cedes and Roland were wonderful friends.  And who could forget Momma C - everyone has a person like her in their lives -loving, smart and always wise.<br />I fell in love with Terry from the very beginning and everyone tthat reads the story will also.  But there has to be a sequal - what happen with Cedes and Roland?  Will Terry and Jackie have children?  Will Catherine think of another plan to win the girls hearts.

I was totally wrong.<br />Michael Datcher was adopted and fatherless.  I could not begin to image the things that went on in his head.  As an unconscious mechanism he had to &quot;Raise Fences&quot; to protect himself from all the things he could not explain.  It was also difficult for him to break through those very same fenses as he searched for a wife and family that he desired.  He had to prove to himself that he was not like so many of the men he encountered that left their families.  Datcher is a gifted jouralist and poet.<br />Datcher's story has a way of capturing the reader and taking you on a journey with him.  I really enjoyed experiencing the story with Datcher.

Next, you add family problems.  Total Drama!  Yet, at some point, you have to pick yourself up and move on with life.  The Browning family had to deal with a family that was built on lies.  As a result, everything they tried to build after was difficult.  Mingus and her sister, Eva, had to learn to accept each other, their parents and themselves.

When I began reading this story, I thought it was going to be another one of those ghetto stories without a moral .  I was surprised.

They wanted material things.  It was not until the found true love for each other that &quot;the Game&quot; became to lose some of it glitter.  Unfortunealty, it was too late.
