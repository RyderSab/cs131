As I watched my bride coming down the aisle toward me, I realized God had given me a great blessing in her. In that moment I knew more than ever before that I wanted our lives to be different. I wanted us to stand out from the world and shine for God. Unfortunately, eight years would pass before I would begin to do the work to make this desire a reality.\\" <br /> <br />In those eight years Clay Crosse became Clay Crosse: Christian Star. His first single, \\"I Surrender All,\\" climbed to the top of the charts and the Gospel Music Association named him New Artist of the Year in 1995. His first four albums went on to produce eight #1 singles. But the white suit came back to haunt Clay. <br /> <br />Even though he and Renee had remained virgins, Clay hadn't remained pure. He'd become dependant on pornography to sate his sexual desires until he was married. As his career took off, with accolades and money flowing freely, he become increasingly self-centered and his shallow faith couldn't support the weight of his success. He and Renee gradually loosened their standards --- using coarse language, laughing at crude jokes, and viewing movies regardless of sexually explicit content. He was able to justify crossing back into porn use because it didn't feel like that much of a stretch from what he viewed in mainstream media on a regular basis. <br /> <br />\\"When I watched a mainstream movie that contained graphic sexual content and nudity, something stirred inside of me. The old feelings I experienced when I watched pornography before I was married came back. I like them, and I wanted more. As I said a moment ago, the focus of my life increasingly was me and what would make me happy. Pornography fed this hunger, and I knew when I could find it,\\" he writes.  <br /> <br />That seemingly benign move started a spiral into lust that, two years later, left Clay perched on the edge of an affair. Thankfully, the Lord got Clay's attention and he started to do the difficult work of reorienting his life on God and others rather than himself. <br /> <br />It's that difficult work that fills the chapters of I SURRENDER ALL, the book Clay and Renee Crosse have written together about his struggles with pornography and lust, and her struggles to forgive and trust him again. The fact that this issue came to a head for them several years ago, in 1998, gives their advice weight. They've been in the marital trenches and have just enough distance from the dark days to offer light, but are close enough to still have compassion and a sense of urgency about the issue. <br /> <br />The couple offers a lot of practical tips for avoiding temptation and supporting a weak spouse. The Crosses also advocate male headship in the household, which some will have theological qualms with. But they and readers can agree that their most important move was to reaffirm their commitment to Christ and to rely on his strength to keep the marriage together when neither of them was able or willing to based on their own power. <br /> <br />Even though Clay and Renee's marriage faced unique opportunities to slide into danger because of his ego-driven profession, it's clear that the temptations Clay faced and the emotions Renee felt are universal. Anyone --- male or female, married or single --- who is struggling through issues stemming from pornography will find valuable information, understanding, and exhortation in I SURRENDER ALL. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-09-30

A few years after the end of the Civil War, life in Georgetown, Kentucky wasn't easy but was familiar to the Harban family. As a former slave turned sharecropper, Ezekiel Harban meets William R. Hill and purchases a plot of land in Kansas. The simple purchase changes everything for this family. Ezekiel and his three daughters --- Jarena, Grace and Truth --- pack their belongings and move to the town of Nicodemus, Kansas.    As this small group of travelers rides the train toward their new home, they have high expectations about the promised town and their plots of land. Then a guide takes the group in some wagons with their possessions to reach the town. Imagine the surprise on their faces when they arrive on the plains of Kansas full of hope yet find nothing. The buildings are \\"forthcoming\\" and any shops and supplies are miles from their land. The expectations of these African Americans are replaced with a determination to make a new life of freedom.    As Judith Miller writes in one of the opening chapters:    And Jarena's father drank up the information like a man dying of thirst. Her father was one of the first in line to hand over his life savings in exchange for four train tickets and a piece of paper. The paper was a deed declaring that he owned a piece of land in what he constantly reminded her was the freest and friendliest state for coloreds to settle: John Brown's former stomping grounds --- Kansas.    Jarena gave her father a sidelong glance. \\"What are you going to do if Nicodemus isn't everything you expect?\\"    \\"You gotta have faith, gal. You's too young to always be lookin' fer the worst in things. Trust the good Lord. We's on the right path.\\"    \\"We'll see, Pappy. We'll see.\\"    As you can see from the dialogue, it's told in the dialect of these former sharecroppers from Kentucky. Almost like reading Mark Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN, the experience is jarring at first until readers hook into the cadence and rhythm. But in the blink of an eye, that feeling soon disappears.    During the story, Jarena becomes more than a caretaker for her family and discovers a romantic attraction to a young man named Thomas Grayson, who has joined the community. When Jarena's boyfriend from Kentucky, Charles Frances, arrives in Nicodemus, the story has some built-in tension between the characters.    Beyond this story of the settlers of Nicodemus, Judith Miller starts a second strand in the storytelling involving the family of Dr. Samuel Boyle. Also living in Georgetown, Kentucky, Dr. Boyle is fed up with the racial prejudice in the south. When he meets William R. Hill, he also purchases land in Hill City, Kansas, or the sister city for Nicodemus. With unhappy feelings from his wife, high society daughter and rebellious son, Dr. Boyle uproots his family and moves them west.    For a majority of the story, the lives of these two families intersect. Dr. Boyle hires Truth Harban to help with the domestic chores in their household as a live-in maid. Periodically Dr. Boyle goes to Nicodemus and treats the medical needs of this nearby community.    Part of the elegance and beauty of historical fiction is how it transports the reader to another time period. Judith Miller has done a masterful job of capturing the mood, dialogue and setting of this period of history on the plains of Kansas. The rich characterizations and moving dialogue combine with a fascinating story of changed lives with a constant reliance on faith and trust in God. This combination provides the reader with a remarkable reading experience and something highly recommended.       [...]	2005-09-30

It's not because the premise is so complicated; it's because of the myriad filters, grids, and perspectives through which readers approach lightning-rod topics like genderism. A tyrannical, controlling male pastor will read this book, and this review, through a grid similar to the one used by the wife of a tyrannical, controlling Christian man. They'll interpret Paul Coughlin's call for a return to the authentic, biblical Jesus as a role model for Christian men in an entirely different way than would, say, the wife of a passive Christian Nice Guy, the classic CNG. <br /> <br />No matter where you live, no matter where you worship --- no matter where you go, for heaven's sake --- you've met your share of CNGs, Christian Nice Guys who traded in the gospel of Jesus Christ for the gospel of playing it safe. As a former CNG, Coughlin recognizes the fear that keeps these men believing in only a meek and mild Jesus --- and believing this is the only view of Jesus they should emulate. Coughlin likens this bogus portrayal of Jesus to that of a \\"bearded woman\\" or a glowing pretty-boy who has just received a \\"to-die-for facial.\\" But the Jesus of the Gospels, Coughlin writes, operates along the entire \\"tender-tough spectrum.\\" A meek and mild wimp doesn't overturn the moneychangers' tables or use heavy doses of sarcasm --- even if it is the \\"blessed sarcasm\\" used by Jesus, which, Coughlin points out, He inherited from His own Father. <br /> <br />The son of an off-the-charts abusive woman, Coughlin learned early on to play it safe. You'd think a personal encounter with the Lion of Judah would have led him into a life of boldness and adventure, but no. The church intervened and taught him to be a docile CNG who never makes waves, never makes a scene (think of Jesus here!), and thus never makes a difference. A series of revelations caused Coughlin tore-examine the kind of man the church had fashioned him into. (My personal favorite was the time he failed to move quickly enough when a traffic light turned green, and he looked in the rearview mirror to discover that the horn-honking, red-faced, livid driver behind him was none other than his \\"perfect\\" pastor.) <br /> <br />A result of those revelations is a changed man who has started what he calls a Good Guy Rebellion --- a call for Christian men to trade in their niceness for genuine goodness, echoing C.S. Lewis's description of Aslan in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE as a lion who is not safe but good. Good guys, he points out, may not be very popular in churches that want to keep them under their thumb, but the transformation from CNG to Good Guy will earn them the long-lost respect of their wives and children, and steer them into a life of authentic obedience to the powerful God they've wanted to serve all along. <br /> <br />My recommendation? Read this along with Dave Murrow's WHY MEN HATE GOING TO CHURCH. But read it only after you have resolved to approach it with an open mind and with a genuine desire to understand Coughlin's perspective. If you don't read the book in its entirety, you'll miss the big picture. And it's a picture no one in the church should miss, especially CNGs and their wives. Oh, and let's not forget all those CNGs who have left the church for the very reasons that made them CNGs in the first place.	2005-09-30

In THE SOUL OF CHRISTIANITY: Restoring the Great Tradition, Smith turns his pen to a defense of the essentials of the Christian faith.    Weaving together thoughtful deductions, history, personal anecdotes, insights from others, poetry and pertinent hymn lyrics, Smith looks at the Christian worldview, the foundational points of Christian theology, and the three branches of the church today. In writing, he says he rarely had to reach for his Bible to check its quotations, for they were \\"in my head and in my life.\\"    This is accessible --- but by no means light --- reading. In Part One, Smith enumerates the fixed points of the Christian world, including its infiniteness (which includes the finite) and its order. There are two distinct ways of knowing, according to the Christian worldview: the rational and the intuitive. \\"After we have done our best to understand the world, it remains mysterious but through the shrouds of mystery, we can dimly discern that it is perfect.\\"    In Part Two, Smith engagingly recaps the foundational points of Christian theology: the incarnation, the atonement, the trinity, eternal life, bodily resurrection, hell and the virgin birth. On the incarnation, \\"Christ was the bridge that joined humanity to God.\\" He offers a beautiful interpretation of the atonement (\\"the most powerful demonstration of the sender's love is to let its receiver know that the sender suffers the pain the recipient suffers\\") and a moving look at the symbolism of the cross.    His thoughts about the trinity are compelling. On Christians believing in the trinity and yet being monotheistic, he reminds us, \\"H20 can be ice, water, or steam without losing its chemical identity.\\" He later adds, \\"If then, love is not just one of God's attributes, but his very essence ---and it may be Christianity's distinctive mission in history to claim just that --- at no point could God have been truly God without being involved in relationship.\\"    In Part Three, Smith examines three divisions of Christianity today: Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism (over 900 denominations in the United States). He briefly illumines each. In Catholicism, he touches on the roles of Mary and the Pope, the Church's defense of human life, and the importance of the sacraments. Smith shows how the Eastern Orthodox Church differs from the Catholic Church in both the extent of its authority and the means by which it reaches its dogma. Smith looks at two aspects of the Protestant Church: justification by faith (faith as a response of the entire self) and the Protestant Principle (warning against idolatry, or \\"absolutizing the relative\\").    Smith admits, \\"Christianity is such a complex phenomenon that it is difficult to say anything significant about it that will carry the assent of all Christians.\\" Some Christian readers will disagree with Smith's points, especially on the exclusivity of Christianity and inerrancy of scripture. \\"There's a new mood in Christendom,\\" he writes, \\"a more conscious, general recognition that though for Christians God is defined by Jesus, he is not confined by Jesus.\\" Smith also asserts, \\"Only a minority of Christians...now claim that all non-Christians will go to hell.\\" His take on biblical inerrancy (\\"The chief Protestant idolatry has been bibliolatry\\") will also be open to debate among more conservative believers.    Writer and philosopher Dallas Willard calls THE SOUL OF CHRISTIANITY \\"a unique achievement for our times\\" with good reason. Christians and non-Christians looking for an accessible yet scholarly overview and defense of the Christian faith will find this a thought-provoking and discussable book.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

Find out in THE FOUR SEASONS OF MARRIAGE, from bestselling author Gary Chapman who penned THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES.    Chapman's tone is that of a friendly, empathetic counselor. First, he invites you to discover which season of marriage you and your spouse are in. These seasons don't progress in order; rather, your marriage is probably fluctuating back and forth between all four, he writes. After you identify your season, Chapman offers seven strategies to help you make the most of that season, and ideas for putting the strategies into practice. As he unpacks the characteristics of each season, Chapman includes profiles of married couples who have come to him for advice and counseling. His hope is to help couples move their marriages from fall or winter into spring or summer.    Marriage, Chapman writes, is both intimate and purposeful. When intimacy --- sharing life in a deep way --- is not attained, we feel troubled. Marriage is also purposeful. It helps us raise our children, and in nurturing and developing our gifts and abilities. \\"Life is easier when two hearts and minds are committed to working together to face the challenges of the day,\\" he writes.    Spring is where most marriages begin. There is joy, excitement and an anticipation of the future. It's a time of new beginnings and positive changes. Summer means happiness, peace, satisfaction, fun and comfort. There is a sense of accomplishment and a desire to keep growing as a couple. You overlook your spouse's shortcomings, and there is a growing sense of togetherness.    Fall, of course, is a precursor to winter, characterized by sadness, apprehension and rejection. A spouse might feel insecure. The couple drifts apart, disengages. An affair may happen, catapulting the marriage into winter. Winter, he writes, is characterized by the emotions of hurt, anger, disappointment, loneliness and rejection. Our attitude is usually bad. We see problems as too big or unresolvable. Our actions include withdrawal, silence, harsh words and even violent acts. Divorce can be just around the corner. \\"The marriage is like two people living in separate igloos,\\" writes Chapman.    If you find yourself in a fall or winter season, Chapman assures you this is not hopeless. This leads to the easy marital profile indicator quiz, which may seem a bit simplistic. Next, Chapman unpacks the seven strategies for enhancing the season you find yourself in, from dealing with past failures (confession, repentance, forgiveness), to a very concrete set of ideas about empathetic listening. The third strategy, \\"Learn to speak your spouse's love language,\\" will feel familiar to readers of THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES, and recaps the ideas from that book. The seventh strategy is one that a spouse can read and implement alone if the other spouse is resistant to working on the marriage. A study guide at the end of the book is suitable for group discussion, with alternate questions for a couple's private use.    There are a few small troubles. Chapman is already touting his THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by page 26 as he does throughout the book, as well as heavily pushing marriage conferences. Both are worthy things to recommend, but it does feel a bit self-promotional. (He's a popular speaker at marriage conferences.) Some of the analogies feel overly cute (the problems in the season of summer are \\"yellowjackets,\\" for example; in spring, it's \\"poison ivy\\").    But these are minor flaws in a helpful book that should mainly appeal to Christians whose marriages are in trouble, or to fans of Chapman's THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES. Small groups and counselors will appreciate the study guide tucked into the back to help with further explorations.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. Contact Cindy at (...)	2005-09-30

The birds sang me songs in my walks to and from school....Clouds followed me and God was in them.\\" <br /> <br />Both of his grandfathers were independent Baptist preachers. His father was an executive at Moody Press in Chicago, the flagship publisher of fundamentalist books. Little Jon was a paid model, smiling for photographs that served to advertise church-family products. From childhood, he sensed he would walk in their footsteps, modeling a public and active faith. \\"God intended me to lead, I was told; that much was clear, and the world out there needs more leaders. Until I was about twenty years old there was nothing else in my life that I so clearly understood: there was a spiritual need and I would meet that need.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, Little Jon was devout. And in this memoir Big Jon gives an excellent description of \\"the spiritual feelings and ideas\\" of such a boy \\"growing up in the American suburbs in the 1970s and 1980s in a distinctive brand of Christianity\\" that thought of itself as the only authentic brand. Sweeney progresses from reflections of childhood to teen and college years, where he, again earnestly, more formally learned the rational basis for Christian faith --- apologetics --- and techniques for witnessing. <br /> <br />Some of Sweeney's most interesting material is the juxtaposition of a fundamentalist faith that is both highly emotive and subjective even as it is very rational and carefully reasoned by stalwarts such as C. I. (Cyrus Ingerson!) Scofield, Charles Ryrie, and Josh McDowell. <br /> <br />In college, on an extended overseas mission trip with the goal of converting Catholics to Christianity, Sweeney came to grips with these two aspects of his faith. Even as he helped these Catholics \\"experience the God of the Bible for the first time,\\" they introduced him to a love for God that was \\"lively, mutable, and intimate.\\" They opened his eyes to what Carl Sandburg called a \\" 'fresh and beautiful' side of Jesus.\\" <br /> <br />Sweeney ultimately was swayed by the relational and mystical aspects of his spiritual legacy. \\"The sensuous, more than the dogma, binds me, like a slip knot, loosely but decisively to my religious place.\\" In his 20s he discovered the Catholic mystics and Benedictine monasticism, even seriously considering entering Thomas Merton's community in Gethsemani, Kentucky. <br /> <br />But instead he married, moved to New England, and...the particulars of his adult life are a bit vague. He works in the publishing field. He is an Episcopalian. He is not a fundamentalist, though it seems he can't quite identify who he would be if it hadn't been for the best of what he learned in that childhood environment. <br /> <br />Readers who consider themselves fundamentalists will gulp at Sweeney's conclusions. Midway through the book he writes, \\"We all need saving --- again and again --- from greed, hate, selfishness, and all of the other vices that consume us, keeping us far from experiencing and understanding the love of God. But, we also need wider hearts and wider experiences of new life, new birth, and the love of God. The formula was not as simple as I was led to believe.\\" <br /> <br />For other readers who may be skeptical of fundamentalism, the book delivers what the subtitle promises: \\"surprising gifts of a fundamentalist childhood.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-09-30

Fischer, a journalist who has enjoyed a personal and professional relationship with the new pope for nearly three decades. Unlike so many of the \\"instant\\" biographies of Ratzinger that appeared in the weeks following his election to the papacy, Fischer's book was in the works and was nearly completed before the death of Pope John Paul II in April of 2005. As a result, he offers a personal perspective lacking in books by authors who were forced to rely on secondhand, encyclopedic information about the new pope. <br /> <br />Because the book is based largely on Fischer's acquaintance with Ratzinger, there is little information about his early life, which is fine for those of us who care more about his theology and less about where he attended kindergarten. Fischer picks up the story in earnest in 1976, when he first interviewed the then-local theologian who was making a name for himself in ecclesiastical circles. As Ratzinger quickly rose to the positions of bishop, archbishop, cardinal, and dean of the college of cardinals, Fischer, the Vatican correspondent for a German newspaper, kept close tabs on the prelate's career and stayed in contact with him on a regular basis. <br /> <br />All that may lead you to suspect that an author who is also a native German Catholic would have a tough time maintaining his journalistic objectivity in writing about the first German to be elected pope since the sixteenth century (or the eleventh century, if you want to get technical, but I don't). However, Fischer paints a remarkably balanced portrait of Pope Benedict XVI, revealing such seeming paradoxes as his warm sense of humor but often cold personality. In fact, Ratzinger comes across as the embodiment of an array of paradoxes: a theological conservative who spearheads innovative efforts designed to bring the old church into a new millennium; a quiet, thoughtful, and content Bavarian theologian whose colleagues from around the world considered him to be God's choice to lead the church's 1.1 billion adherents through a time of seismic cultural change. <br /> <br />Fischer also examines the new pope's history of conflict with proponents of \\"liberation theology,\\" a movement that arose in Latin America in the 1970s through which many Catholic clerics took up the cause of the poor and the oppressed against the rich and the powerful. For Ratzinger and many other Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, the problem was not in the cause itself but in the Marxist thought and the highly politicized nature of the movement. He and other conservatives believed the church should find solutions outside the political arena; liberals believed there was no way the church could be effective in Latin America without entering the political fray. <br /> <br />The memory of that conflict could have prevented Ratzinger from rising through the ranks as he did, were it not for his unwavering stance on issues surrounding church doctrine. According to the author, the other cardinals held Ratzinger's interpretation of, and commitment to, doctrinal authority in such high regard that for many, his election to the papacy was a foregone conclusion. <br /> <br />A lover of classical music who is looking forward to meeting Bach and Mozart in heaven, Ratzinger was not so enthusiastic about ascending to the highest position in the Roman Catholic Church. During the papal voting process in April, he \\"begged God to spare him 'this guillotine',\\" Fischer writes. It's insights like that that make this biography a much more interesting and personal one than others on the market. If that's what you're looking for, along with a fairly extensive survey of the last thirty years of Catholic thought from a European perspective, then this is the book to buy.	2005-09-30

She challenges all Christians to cling to this positive expectant-type of thinking as the only viable lifestyle in a world gone adrift. <br /> <br />Opening her text, Briscoe shares the tremulous moments she experienced on 9/11 while flying back from Russia to the United States. High above the Atlantic, writes Briscoe, our world entered the \\"new normal.\\" It was at this moment (as she reached for the emergency procedure card in the seat before her) that the author had to revisit her faith and decide if she did indeed believe what she had for years professed both publicly and privately. Was God in control? Like so many other believers, Briscoe admits that her faith was tested and she battled to find her mental and spiritual footing. <br /> <br />Wrestling internally, Briscoe reaffirmed to herself some foundational key principles regarding her understanding of God and His character. She reminded herself that God is never caught off-guard and He cannot be shaken or moved, even when everything else falls apart. God is there (here), sustaining and supporting. Like so many in the world who ask why God would allow such tragedy, Briscoe also felt these questions rise. She considered life --- with all its pain, divorce, infidelity, disease, financial ruin --- and wondered how people would be able to cope with the added burden of this \\"new normal\\" and its substantially heightened level of uncertainty that gave rise following 9/11. People aren't coping well; society as a whole is experiencing more anxiety, depression, panic and pessimism across all classes, creeds and ages. Briscoe admits to some sleepless nights following 9/11 where instead of counting sheep, she was counting terrorists. <br /> <br />So what is the answer to regain a solid spiritual standing whereby Christians do not simply survive the next onslaught of terror, but reach out with compassionate care and courage? Briscoe believes Christians have two choices. They can head down the path of fear, thus paralyzing and debilitating any potential good that hope may offer an unbelieving world. Or they can deal with the fear factor with faith; the faith factor, says Briscoe, is rooted in the Father factor. Whom we place our trust in is paramount. Likewise, trusting God and His unfaltering love is essential because the Bible states plainly, \\"The secret things belong to the Lord our God...\\" (Deuteronomy 29:29). Meaning what? That on this side of heaven there will be countless \\"secrets\\" Christians will have to leave hanging in God's faithful hands --- not every answer will be given on earth. Briscoe tells Christians to remember that life is fleeting and today's opportunity to share the love of Christ with a terrified world is short. The author lovingly admonishes fellow believers to set aside mediocrity and get on with the business of evangelizing, seeing the brevity of life for what it truly is. <br /> <br />As is Briscoe's custom, she communicates with a gentle sincerity and her advice begs to be followed. Both the careworn and the apathetic will appreciate this message to live life boldly and with unconventional conviction. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-09-30

Chediak, who has been involved in lay ministry with singles and has delivered pastoral messages on the topics of singleness, romance and biblical wisdom, has brought together a weighty group of Christian authors and writers who all offer somewhat similar (because each are based on Christian principles) yet simultaneously diverse opinions on the hows and how-not-tos of dating. <br /> <br />Lauren Winner opens the text with her treatise on dating according to the \\"counter-cultural path,\\" which suggests that dating can be healthy if certain guidelines are imposed and carried out. Winner believes that Christians must date \\"against the grain of American standards,\\" meaning each relationship should confine itself within a context of community, chastity and love, with an orientation toward marriage. <br /> <br />Author and editor Douglas Wilson, who purports that guidelines and methods can only be so effective and that a principle of courtship fills the bill, presents the \\"courtship path.\\" Under this system, the head of the household will hold authority over a couple's relationship. Couples following this course are seriously committed to pursuing marriage, yet a breakup is acceptable under special circumstances, though this is not the norm within the general courtship model. <br /> <br />Pastor and college instructor Rick Holland presents the third dating pattern, the \\"guided path,\\" most notable for its ten principles that he believes helps set a standard for discovering a life partner. Holland includes such insightful guidelines as understanding the necessity of developing godly character, seeking confirmation from parents, friends and church, living a life of current contentment, having common ground and being companionable, while effective communication and chastity also play a key part in biblical dating according to Holland's method. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most challenging to understand and relate to in modern society is Jonathan Lindvall's \\"betrothal path.\\" Lindvall, president of Bold Christian Living, believes that dating defrauds the other person by potentially offering either emotional or physical intimacy that cannot rightfully be given prior to marriage. When adhering to the betrothal mode, couples are essentially engaged at the very onset of their relationship and breaking up is never acceptable. As with the courtship model, the father of the woman holds authority over the entire relational proceeding. <br /> <br />Married authors and speakers Jeramy and Jerusha Clark discuss the \\"purposeful path,\\" which asserts that dating doesn't necessarily have to be serious; it can be fun yet needs to be taken seriously. The Clarks believe that dating in and of itself can encourage character refinement and help prepare couples for marriage if done both responsibly and purposefully. <br /> <br />Each of these models includes key definitions and distinctives, personal reasons for the authors believing as they do, scriptural and spiritual principles, benefits/weaknesses, an overview, and several real-life scenarios that aid readers in seeing how the model looks and is worked out in life. <br /> <br />Readers young and old will find much to contemplate and consider with this text. Perhaps after studying each model, young men and women will piece together their own individual style for dating based on these authors' exceptional presentations. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-09-30

In BOO, Gutteridge introduced us to the quirky town of Skary, Indiana. The small town's economic life revolves around famous bestselling horror novelist Wolfe Boone --- or \\"Boo\\" --- from the Haunted Mansion restaurant to Spooky's Bookstore. When Wolfe becomes a Christian and chooses to quit writing horror novels, his decision turns the town upside down. In BOO HOO, the little town of Skary is on the edge of bankruptcy, Wolfe has become a car salesman, and his fiance, Ainsley Parker, is on track to become the next Martha Stewart.    If you haven't read Gutteridge's earlier works, put this book down and read them in order. Although it's not impossible to read this as a stand-alone novel, you'll enjoy it more with some background.    Now, the town has gone \\"from famous to obscure to a magnet for all things suburban.\\" BOO HISS picks up the story as a two-headed rosy boa named Bob and Fred is on the loose in Skary. (Just for you skeptics, two-headed snakes are possible, though a rarity). The characters juggle other problems. Wolfe is struggling with writer's block. Ainsley longs to have a baby but nothing is happening, and her carefully ordered life is thrown out of kilter when Melb gets pregnant, and Melb and Oliver (improbably) take up temporary residence with Wolfe and Ainsley.    Just-arrived suburban soccer mom extraordinaire Katelyn Downey (mother of the devilish imp, five-year-old Willem) are determined to turn the little town of Skary into the Next Big Thing. A new cell phone tower, soccer field, coffeehouse complete with lattes and frou frou drinks, and some major changes at the church are only a few of the items on her agenda. The gentle Reverend Peck is spinning over all the changes Katelyn brings to his church, and wonders if the new cappuccino bar will be more of an attraction than hissermons. Will Skary lose its small-town values?    Romance is also in the air in the most unlikely places. Martin Blarty (short and contemplating hair implants) and Ainsley's dad, Sheriff Bart Parker (tall and clueless about women), are both attracted to Lois, The Queen of Menopause (\\"Eccentricity can be attractive, especially when it comes with hot flashes\\"). Lois has launched a town play and, in the process of casting, finds herself dating both men. As she ponders their flaws, she muses, \\"As a mature woman, your standards haven't slipped, they've just deepened to include Volvos instead of Covettes.\\" Lois's sleepwalking leads to an unexpected engagement --- and more trouble --- and the play turns into a reality show.    When the strangely named Leonard Tarffeski, a charming snake hunter from New Zealand (where there are no snakes) appears to save the day --- or capture and sell the unusual snake for financial gain --- things quickly disintegrate.    Writers will enjoy some of the lines tossed at Wolfe (his father-in-law says in one aside, \\"It's not like you work or anything...\\"). Christian publishing industry folks will also snicker at the subplot involving Wolfe's editor/agent Alfred Tennison's discovery of the \\"Christian fiction\\" and his attempts to blend in --- and cash in.    If you're looking for a serious literary read to analyze for character development and plot treatment, look elsewhere. To enjoy this book, you'll have to suspend your disbelief from the earliest pages. However, if you want a book that's pure fun, BOO HISS is it. Relax and enjoy the pure whimsicalness of Gutteridge's imagination.    (...)	2005-09-30

While touring Mauthausen she heard the story of 23 Americans who liberated a local concentration camp and that the first person into the camp to help the prisoners was a Nazi wife. She knew this was a story she had to write and the result was her first novel, FROM DUST AND ASHES. <br /> <br />She has continued to write books based on the events of World War II, but her latest, DAWN OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS, shifts its focus to the South Pacific theater of the conflict. Starting in Hawaii in the days shortly before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the story introduces readers to pilots Libby Conners and Dan Lukens. Libby is working as a flight instructor on the island where prejudices against female pilots are less ingrained. Dan is a hotshot Army Air Corps pilot. Their paths cross at a local beach and it's not long before the two become a couple. <br /> <br />DAWN OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS is an atypical romance novel in that the central couple spends the bulk of the story separated. Dan is shipped out to the Philippines, sent further into the South Pacific, and Libby promises to wait for him. But in his absence, what was then unthinkable happens. The Japanese attack Pearl Harbor and Libby makes the difficult decision to head back to the mainland and join the new Women's Auxiliary Ferry Squadron (WAFS). <br /> <br />The years that follow provide grueling tests of endurance --- physical and emotional --- for both Dan and Libby. Captured by the Japanese, Dan experiences the legendarily brutal Bataan Death March and years as a POW. Meanwhile, Libby suffers a freak accident on one of her missions and faces the possibility of losing her sight --- and her ability to fly --- permanently. And when a would-be suitor hits the scene, Libby has to weigh her hopes for a future with Dan against the very real possibility that he is no longer alive. <br /> <br />One of the hallmarks of Goyer's writing is that she approaches her narrative from multiple angles. And in DAWN OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS she gives us not only Dan and Libby's perspectives, but also that of Natsuo Hidki, an interpreter in the Imperial Japanese Army who also attended college in the United States. Natsuo has been trained to value honor and allegiance to the Japanese Emperor over all, but he is conflicted by the memories of his time in the U.S. and the kindness shown to him by one of his classmates in particular. <br /> <br />The plot might not offer much in the way of surprises, but the effort Goyer puts into her research to create vivid and historically accurate landscapes --- political, social and physical --- for her books is well-spent. The story is certainly a compelling history lesson as it incorporates news articles, letters, and official broadcasts from the era. Fans of the historical fiction genre certainly will be pleased with this new addition. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-09-30

Lost: Discovering Ways to Connect with the People Jesus Misses Most	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A challenging and encouraging view of evangelism	Some types of evangelism techniques have gotten a bad rap because they use a blend of aggressiveness and fear tactics to try to convert someone to their own beliefs. As a result, some Christians are weary of evangelism all together. But Jim Henderson breathes life and hope into the idea of fulfilling the Great Commission for even the most timid believer in his new book, a.k.a. \\"LOST\\", which argues that evangelism can be as normal as asking questions, listening to people and being responsive to their needs.    Henderson's approach to evangelism is as simple as a-b-c and 1-2-3. He doesn't believe in looking at people who aren't Christians as \\"lost\\" but prefers the term \\"missing persons.\\" This may seem like semantics, but it represents a larger paradigm shift in the way people are approached. No longer is it our duty to \\"save\\" people, but rather to recognize them as individuals God is passionately pursuing. This helps erase any sense of superiority and invites Christians to partner with God to nudge others toward a real relationship with Jesus.    He writes, \\"When it comes to evangelism, we can be our ordinary selves, and it turns out to be good enough. It turns out that all Jesus needs are the five loaves and two fish of our lives --- something we already have. Rather than trying to escape the ordinary, we should exploit it and attempt something small for God, something ordinary.\\"    The style of evangelism that Henderson encourages is refreshingly simple and literally anyone can do it. He encourages readers to develop \\"the art of noticing\\" by simply reflecting on the people in their lives and celebrating moments with them. He suggests asking questions about faith and spirituality and listening to people's answers --- without trying to share your own beliefs right off the bat. He encourages small talk, avoiding Christian clichs and saying \\"Wow\\" when you don't know what else to say. For some, that may seem like common sense 101, but Henderson is somehow able to communicate these basic truths with a contagious sense of compassion and love.    The book itself is dotted with stories of everyday people who are impacting their world one conversation and one day at a time. Most of these stories don't end with the dramatic convert falling on their knees and becoming a Christian. Rather they demonstrate people coming one click closer to a relationship with their redeemer. For those weary of traditional evangelism approaches, the message is both freeing and compelling.    With chapters including \\"Boldness Is Overrated,\\" \\"Do What's Doable\\" and \\"Out of Religion and Into Reality,\\" readers get the sense that even the biggest scaredy cat can be brave when it comes to sharing their faith. Each chapter ends with a section on \\"Attempting the Ordinary,\\" which provides very practical ideas on how to live out the message of the book.    Overall, a.k.a \\"LOST\\" is a refreshing read. The book moves forward at a comfortable, conversational pace. If the idea of evangelism leaves you shaking in your boots, you'll find yourself both encouraged and challenged by this book.

If that's what you think, well, it turns out you're not entirely wrong. Carmen Renee Berry's survey of Christian thought on sex reveals an inordinate amount of emphasis on the subject throughout church history. <br /> <br />Berry's \\"unauthorized guide\\" is divided into three major sections. The first traces the history of Christian (and Jewish) attitudes toward sex, as well as historical thinking on which sexual practices were considered appropriate and, of course, which were not. Conservatives and liberals alike would do well to read this section in particular; many Christians, I'm sure, would be surprised at how ancient laws regarding property rights helped shape ideas on sexuality that have survived to this day, for instance, or how Luther's early opposition to celibacy helped shape the thinking that led to the Protestant Reformation. <br /> <br />The second section examines four specific issues that stand as obstacles to church unity in contemporary society: sexual purity, celibacy, abortion, and homosexuality. Berry offers insight into each issue by examining them from a variety of perspectives and, in some cases, a variety of denominational perspectives --- a particularly helpful bit of information for anyone who tends to lump all Christians together. The third major section looks at sex scandals in the church, providing some troubling statistics on the incidence of rape, pedophilia and other forms of sexual abuse, sex addiction, pornography, and the like within the church. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Berry offers resources with regard to each specific issue and provides a separate listing of resources in an appendix. Other appendices offer statistics on sexual misconduct, most of which specifically cite behavior among Christians, and a list of questions readers can use to help discern where they stand on foundational beliefs such as Jesus and the authority of the Bible --- beliefs that go a long way toward predicting and understanding a person's attitude toward sex. <br /> <br />If you're familiar with Berry's other books, such as THE UNAUTHORIZED GUIDE TO CHOOSING A CHURCH and the New York Times bestseller GIRLFRIENDS, you'll be glad to know that she continues with her warm, conversational style of writing in this book. In Berry's hands, church history becomes a series of delightful, interconnected stories that shed light on the way Christian thinking on sexuality has developed. As usual, her wit is never far from the surface. <br /> <br />Berry's purpose in tackling such highly charged topics is commendable; she'd like to see Christians on both sides of, say, the abortion divide talking to each other rather than attacking each other. The same goes for all the other sexually related issues that create division in the church. Berry writes in a way that shows she genuinely wants each side of a given issue to understand how and why the other side has reached the conclusions it has. <br /> <br />One can only hope that her readers will take the hint. Berry has done the church a service by providing a highly readable and entertaining look at the way diverse Christians approach sexual issues; the church would be wise to return the favor by encouraging those diverse Christians to begin a conversation with each other that focuses on finding common ground as well as solutions to sex-related problems that plague the church and society.	2005-09-30

Ault's purpose: \\"to better understand popular support for this new-style conservatism marching proudly behind the banner of 'family values.'\\" His interest: \\"it wasn't [the pastor's] religion that had brought me to follow him on his round of duties....It was his politics.\\" His method: anthropologically studying the \\"community enterprise\\" of this one church and its attendant school. <br /> <br />After a year, Ault proposed extending his involvement and filming a documentary about the church --- titled \\"Born Again,\\" airing on PBS in 1987. The book project came more than a decade later, which means that some of the political commentary seems dated. And yet most of the book is a keen and still-relevant look at the church's faith, social mores, and informal systems. <br /> <br />Working from tapes and notes, Ault walks us chronologically through his several years as a welcomed but suspect outsider, at church services, home Bible studies, men's prayer breakfasts, Sunday dinners. He puts himself into the story; you see his measured reaction to parishioners; there's the day he reads his name on someone's refrigerator --- a prayer request for his salvation. And their reaction to him --- his quiet presence (listening) and carefully phrased questions (so as not to make people defensive). After a year, the pastor's wife tells him, \\"You know, I never know where you stand on things....But somehow I think you understand.\\" Though an atheist, Ault had grown up in a liberal Methodist parsonage, and this surely gives him a head start in understanding some of the in-talk of sermons and extended conversations he chooses to print --- with dead-on authenticity. In time, mutual misgiving melts. <br /> <br />Ault's narrative, as engaging and climactic asa novel, is interspersed with cultural, and some theological, analyses of the church, drawing on a larger body of research, evidenced by 30 pages of notes and a 10-page bibliography. A chapter such as \\"Fundamentalism and Tradition\\" is not light entertainment.   <br /> <br />Ault spends considerable time on family and gender issues, as does the church itself. \\"The day-to-day business of church life had much to do with transforming and ordering family relationships, especially marriage.\\" Marriages have been solidified, largely because errant husbands had come home from local bars and taken responsibility for their families. But church and family patriarchy is more complicated than Ault had suspected. \\"The man's the head,\\" the pastor's wife tells him, but \\"the woman's the neck that turns the head.\\" This informal scheme is, as Ault says, \\"what everybody sees\\" and \\"what everybody knows\\" --- despite the official line. <br /> <br />There's an insightful tangential plot (and analysis) of social networks, gossip, and tussles for community power; factions leave the church, pastor and people feel betrayed, and ultimately new leadership takes over. This church, like every since the first, is made up of people who struggle, as the book title suggests, \\"between the spirit and the flesh.\\"  <br /> <br />Both the last chapter and the epilogue are postscripts to Ault's active involvement in the church, and in some ways they are the most interesting. Something took. Or, in gospel parlance, the seed bore fruit, the prodigal came home --- not that Ault became a fundamentalist or even a Baptist, but he has claimed faith and worships with a church community. And, even as the very publication of this book suggests, he has a vision for breaking down the negative, even demonizing, stereotypes that liberals and conservatives --- both in and outside of the church --- have of each other. <br /> <br />At the end of the book he proposes inviting \\"a group of fundamentalists and right-to-lifers together with a group of feminists and progressives\\" on a three-day boat ride. He admits it would be a risky venture (someone quipped, \\"Will there be enough life jackets?\\"), but at least he dares to dream. At least we could dare to suggest that people on both sides read Ault's book with an open mind. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-09-30

THE POTLUCK CLUB, a collaboration between authors Linda Evans Shepherd and Eva Marie Everson, which explores the relationships of women in a small Colorado town.    It's not really about the food. Potluck president and founder Evangeline Benson is single, and surprisingly enough hates to cook. Her well-ordered life is about to tank. When her favorite niece, 25-year-old Leigh, becomes pregnant and jets out to live with her, \\"Aunt Evie's\\" life turns topsy-turvy. Nosy 47-year-old Lisa Leann Lambert is new to Summit View and has a plan to revamp the members of the Potluck Club --- complete with Mary Kay makeovers --- and install herself as the leader. Goldie Dippel's marriage of nearly 30 years to the womanizing Jack is in trouble. His affairs are no secret in the small town, especially to fellow potlucker and law officer Donna Vesey. Donna, however, is unsurprised by Goldie's troubles. Her philosophy on the other gender tends toward, \\"Show me a good man, and I'll show you a woman in drag.\\"    Rounding out the club is \\"rock solid\\" Lizzie Prattle and Vonnie Westbrook. Lizzie is happily married to Samuel, and her deaf adult daughter Michelle is a friend of Leigh's. Although Lizzie's life is an open book, Vonnie has a secret past. Vonnie's first husband Joe was killed in Vietnam, and after a difficult delivery, she was told her baby boy was stillborn. No one knew about her marriage and child except her parents. Now, Vonnie loves her second husband and grade school sweetheart Fred, but \\"he'll never hold a candle to Joe.\\" Vonnie grieves her inability to have more children and compensates by collecting baby dolls (528) plus countless baby kitsch.    The chapters bounce back and forth in first person point of view of each of the six women, while in between chapters, ace reporter Clay Whitefield muses over the state of affairs in Summit View, offering yet another perspective. (Although the characters are distinctly different, their voices tend to sound similar.) There's a few clichs (\\"If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy) but for the most part, the story is engaging and interesting.    When Pastor Kevin's wife, Jan, discovers she has breast cancer (which he seems rather unemotional about in too many places), the Potluck Club finds that the best seasoning for their group is some prayer. Each character wrestles with a point of tension: Vonnie, her haunted past; Donna, an estrangement from God and an old flame; Evangeline, a desire for romance and a need to reconcile the death of a friend; Goldie's frustration with a philandering husband; Lizzie's desire to understand prayer and how it is answered; Lisa Leann's need for control). Resolution for the characters' difficulties comes as it does in life --- sometimes quickly and neatly, other times more open-ended and messy. A few loose ends dangle for what the authors promise will be a yet-untitled sequel due out in 2006.    Each chapter graphic is a handwritten recipe card with a yummy-sounding dish, from the humble pancake to apple-rhubarb custard pie. (Full recipes are included in the back of the book.)

Jesse Butterworth is one of those kids. In SIX STRING ROCKETEER, Butterworth candidly shares what it was like to discover that his parents were separating and eventually ending their marriage. <br /> <br />Butterworth's book reads like a high school memoir. It's filled with funny stories of growing up as a Christian with all its ironies and rather bizarre spiritual-meets-secular moments. He describes being part of the \\"God Squad\\" in school and the struggles and heartache of being a slightly overweight kid with the name Butterworth. (And in case you're wondering, yes, he has already heard all the jokes.) His personal stories are delivered in a humorous, deprecating manner that is both engaging and relatable. <br /> <br />He writes, \\"We were often referred to as the \\"God Squad\\" because we were all church kids. But it wasn't our deep love for the unlovely, our hours donated to charity, or our total abandonment to Jesus that set us apart. It was that we didn't cuss. We avoided every forbidden four-letter word by substituting words like frigging and schista and using phrases such as 'What the crap!' Also, if we ever said something negative about a person, we began by saying, 'Bless her heart,' and then followed it up with something like, 'but Janet is truly the most repulsive girl in the whole school.'\\" <br /> <br />Barely crossing 100 pages, the actual allusions to the breakup of his family are late in coming. In many ways, this isn't really a book about divorce --- it's a book about growing up as a Christian kid in a secular world and having your world rocked by an all-too-common reality. The actual moment where Butterworth finds out the gruesome news that his parents are separating doesn't hit until page 57. That's when readers discover his response of shock and grief. For the last half of the book, we learn of his emotional shutdown and recovery. We also learn how the tender gift of his father --- an old guitar --- provided a much-needed path for healing. Throughout, Butterworth acknowledges God and communicates vulnerably without being preachy. <br /> <br />Within the chapters, the author adds little pieces of trivia and humor. The book is packed with sidebars and inserts. There's a reference to a babysitter who wouldn't let the kids watch \\"The Smurfs\\" and a respelling of a \\"Pines\\" neighborhood sign to something far more amusing. <br /> <br />There's also a lots of random trivia, like the \\"Special Secret Mario Message\\" that reads: \\"Defeat Koopaling at the end of an Airshop (Worlds 1-7) while wearing either the Frog, Tanooki, or Hammer Brothers suit and receive a special message from the King.\\" While only Super Mario fans will truly appreciate this, it adds color to the text and is a welcome addition for short attention span readers. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Butterworth does a masterful job of keeping off-color humor and references to a G-rating. He hints and alludes without crossing any lines. <br /> <br />Overall, SIX STRING ROCKETEER is a refreshing read for today's youth.

From his home in Chicago, Calvin decides to ride his motorcycle along Route 66.    From the first sentence I was hooked on this page-turning life drama. \\"Journal-September 11: I once heard someone say that a man spends the first forty-five years of his life building a tower --- only to discover that he has built it against the wrong wall. It somehow seems fitting that I'm starting this journey on 9/11, the anniversary of the day the towers came down...It's an image that provides a perfect metaphor for the last five years of my life.\\"    From reading Calvin's journey, you begin to learn more about the man. At one time he was married and was the senior pastor of a large, thriving church. Then, through a series of choices, life fell apart until his marriage and his church evaporated. While riding his Harley, Calvin searches for answers and makes significant stops along the route.    His first visit is with Dr. Julius Leppick, an 89-year-old retired professor. The two men talk about the journey of life and the older man pulls out a napkin and draws a simple illustration. Ascent leads upward with descent or the wisdom journey leading downward. And crisis is inserted in the middle of the journey. Calvin wonders about his place in this journey, tucks the napkin away, and heads further along Route 66. In Missouri, he meets another older man, Joseph Monroe, who adds an additional element to the napkin illustration: initiation. It's where a boy learns to become a man.    Traveling into the Ozarks, Calvin meets Rev. William Wolf and their discussion adds another element about life to thenapkin. During the period right before crisis, Wolf adds self-identity to the simple drawing. Whenever an element is added, Calvin is engaged in another fascinating discussion about the key issues of life.    In Kansas, Calvin picks up a hitchhiker named Nikki. She travels with him for another section of the Route. When they go in different directions, Nikki makes Calvin promise to meet with a Catholic priest in New Mexico.    Throughout the physical and spiritual journey, Calvin doesn't answer every question or solve every problem. This gives a realistic bent to the overall novel, whose storyline simply points the reader in solid directions. I picked up this book with plans to read only a few pages and see what it contained.

Instead, debut novelist Bob Beltz surprised me with the adventures of his character and the revealing answers from his journey. Before long I was turning the last page.

The husband and wife team of \\"F. P. Lione\\" (Frank and Pam) are back with THE CROSSROADS, the second installment in the \\"Midtown Blue\\" series and follow-up to THE DEUCE. If you haven't read the first novel, stop here and do so. Although this can be read as a stand-alone, you'll miss too much background. Plus, the first one is too good to miss.    The story opens as middle-aged single cop Tony Cavalucci and his New York City police department prepare for the chaos of New Year's Eve in Times Square. Since THE DEUCE, Tony hasn't had a drink for almost six months. His stalwart Christian partner, Joe Fiore, encourages him with scripture verses and pep talks. Tony is dating Michele, a teacher and unmarried mother of four-and-a-half year old Stevie. Although he's thinking about marriage, he's gotten her earrings rather than \\"the ring\\" for Christmas.    Tony's volatile extended family continues to give him trouble. \\"Hey, we put the fun in dysfunctional,\\" says Tony to Joe. When Tony brings Michele and Stevie to his family Christmas get-together, things quickly disintegrate. Muses Tony, \\"Michele is always so tactful, she would never come out and say they were a bunch of psychopaths.\\" As a result, Michele pulls back from the relationship, and Tony sees his family --- and how he interacts with them --- in a new light. In the process, he and his mother begin a reconciliation of sorts.    This second novel, like the first, still has some rough spots. The authors take care to explain some of the police lingo, but the explanations often feel intrusive and interfere with the flow of the story (a glossary might have served readers better). In some places, one wonders why an abbreviation was used at all (Tony talks about his RDO, then in parenthesis it says \\"regular day off.\\" Why not just say it?) A consistent problem in both novels is that too many sentences begin consecutively with the same word or words and many of the sentences are the same length. There is also an overuse of the word \\"I.\\" (\\"I unlocked the door... I tossed my keys... I had gotten a cell phone...) Although most readers won't consciously register these facts, they will likely find the writing choppy and repetitive in places.    Many things have improved since the first novel, including the mechanics of the characters and the more careful use of details that enhance, rather than bog down, the storyline. What remains the same is the Liones' terrific insider look at New York City and the day-to-day work of policemen working the streets. Both husband and wife are Italian American children of NYPD detectives, and Frank is a veteran of the New York Police Department.    The Liones' Italian-American heritage shows in the wonderful descriptions of food and of family get-togethers. Indeed, anyone reading the plethora of foodie details included here (the cops can't get a bagel without the Liones describing each flavor and topping) will feel compelled to fix a snack while they continue reading. However, beware: the \\"ick\\" factor is still in full play from book one. Some of the scenes include Tony helping an alcoholic repeatedly throw up buckets of blood, drunks wetting their pants in the police car, etc.    The Liones have a knack for using humor to leaven some of the darkness of police work, and several of the incidents are so bizarre you figure they must be real (the woman answering the door naked, the man dressed as a vampire in a coffin). I laughed out loud many times while reading, especially at the arrest of Santa Claus (drunk in a bar with The Grinch). The authors also excel at offering interesting, behind-the-scenes police factoids. I found the logistics of handling between 500,000 and a million people in Times Square for New Year's Eve fascinating --- who would have thought the deceptively simple gathering of so many folks on a holiday required such organization and careful handling?    Fans of THE DEUCE will be delighted with this second installment in the \\"Midtown Blue\\" series, which offers the same mix of humor, grit, and relationship tangles that made the first novel so interesting.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

Andrew had bacterial meningitis, a wildly virulent and life-threatening disease. Within a few days, Andrew was covered from head to toe in a deep purpose rash, his skin covered with lesions and his vital organs on the verge of shutting down. After battling for more than a month, doctors were able to save Andrew's life, but they weren't able to save his legs. Both had to be removed below the knees.    UP AND RUNNING is a remarkable story about courage and comebacks. It walks readers through a very detailed account of Andrew's illness and recovery. But this book is about more than just one boy; it is packed with insightful stories about the team of doctors, family members, friends and a priest who became involved in supporting Andrew and his family through their work, donations and prayer.    The book itself is honest, vulnerable and refreshing. It doesn't candy-coat the full spectrum of emotions Andrew's family felt: The anger. The doubt. The depression. And the distance that developed between Andrew's parents. One of the most powerful storylines in the book follows the Batesons' marriage, which unravels but then finds reconciliation and renewal.    The writing itself is simple and straightforward. Many of the sentences are extremely short in order to convey a sense of urgency and draw readers into the story. Overall, it's an effective device that brings the book alive in the second half.    Unexpectedly, there's a lot of humor in this book --- mostly contributed by Andrew's quick wit and spunk. Whether he was getting the best of his nurses or saying \\"ouch\\" when someone stepped on his foot, the book has a nice array of lighter moments. At one point, Andrew is out riding his bike when he accidentally bumped the release button on one of his prosthetics. His father watched and yelled for a neighborhood boy nearby to catch Andrew who was heading down the street.    Patinkin writes, \\"A moment before Andrew's leg came off, a college-aged jogger had come around the corner. He saw the whole thing and appeared panicked. He asked if they wanted him to call 911. Scott didn't have time to chat about it. He just grabbed Andrew's detached leg and kept running. The young man looked as though he had seen a ghost. His face was white, and he appeared to be shaking... Afterward, Scott would joke about the college student who perhaps still thought he saw a child get his leg sliced off by a bike. At the same time, Scott felt bad for the young man. It was not the kind of sight you would easily get over. The next day, Scott and Rebecca decided to get Andrew a bike with handbrakes.\\"    Overall, UP AND RUNNING is a wonderful book packed with hope and life. Highly recommended.       --- Reviewed by Margaret Feinberg (...)	2005-09-30

Hideaway is a small town in the Ozarks peopled by families who have lived and worked there for generations. The Cooper family has been prominent in Hideaway history and has weathered more tragedies than one would expect in such a peaceful, bucolic setting.    When Carissa Cooper was six years old, her mother left and was replaced by monsters that hid under her bed and in her closet, terrorizing her every night. But her loving father Cecil, caring stepmother Melva and nearby extended family helped her, and now, at age twelve, she is a fairly well-adjusted young lady. However, when she decides to do a school project involving her family's history, she unwittingly stirs up long hidden secrets that have been haunting the Coopers for many years --- secrets so powerful that Carissa is abducted and nearly killed in an effort to keep them from being exposed.    Her cousin Noelle, who has the gift of premonition, senses something is wrong and races to Cedar Hollow from her home in Springfield. There she runs into her childhood friend Nathan Trask, who has been praying for her to return home so they could renew their once precious friendship. He becomes her ally as they seek to unravel not only the mystery of Carissa's abduction but also of the secrets that threaten the lives of the entire Cooper family.    However, evidence points to the fact that the very family that is in danger also harbors the one who is guilty of past crimes as well as the current abduction. None is above suspicion, including Carissa's brother Justin, her cousin Jill, and even her great-aunt Pearl. Has the family history of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) transformed somehow from a neurosis to a psychosis?    With Nathan's help, Noelle begins to renew the faith of her childhood and learn to accept the gift she has instead of fearing it. Through their efforts the family learns to deal with \\"Cooper's Curse\\" and to rely upon God instead of their own feeble attempts to keep the truth hidden out of fear. As LAST RESORT unfolds, redemption comes in many forms to those who learn to embrace the love and grace of God. This is a well-written story with some breath-holding rescue scenes, and a tender love story thrown in at no extra charge!    (...)	2005-09-30

On March 15, 2004, the couple, along with three other aid workers, spent the day surveying the needs at a refugee camp in northern Iraq. On their way back into the safe zone in Kurdish-held territory, militants ambushed their truck and Carrie would be the only one to survive. <br /> <br />FACING TERROR, written by Carrie with help from popular author Kristin Billerbeck, recounts the harrowing events of the day that would forever change her life. But far from being a cautionary tale, FACING TERROR is a call to serve Christ wherever one lives and is, at its core, a love story --- a story of love between a man and a woman, and a story of the love those two people shared for the Arab world. <br /> <br />David and Carrie met in Bethlehem on New Year's Day 2000. Despite the location, it was a rather inauspicious start to their romance. Introduced by fellow \\"journeymen,\\" Carrie spent the time mistakenly calling David \\"Nathan\\" and thought little about him when the holiday was over. But when they were re-introduced several months later at a sports camp for local youth, she took more notice. \\"There was a spark within him that just lit up the dark sky. He was genuinely warm and friendly, he was a wonderful storyteller, and he was funny. I hoped this wasn't the last time we'd met, and although I can't say my romantic pursuits were obvious, I didn't want this man just to walk out of my life,\\" she writes. <br /> <br />During that stage of their ministries, Carrie was living out of a converted shipping container in Israel's West Bank and David was traveling all over Africa and the Middle East. They exchanged emails and the relationship deepened through what would become sometimes-daily missives. At the same time, both had a deepening sense of love for and calling to the Muslim people of the Middle East. \\"David asked what I would do after I finished my term of service in Israel. I told him that I would return home to attend seminary and then come back to the region to work among Arab-speaking Muslims. He then asked how I came to that decision. I explained that it was nothing I had decided --- the Lord had just put a passion for these people within me and anything different would mean being disobedient to Him.\\" <br /> <br />She continues, \\"He seemed surprised to find a girl who wanted to live in such a strict culture and shared with me the experiences he had seen the girls on his team go through. David then told me of his love for Sudan and some of his adventures. He said that he too felt called back to this area, but didn't know exactly where --- just that it was with Arab-speaking Muslims.\\" <br /> <br />The couple spent two years getting to know each other, and FACING TERROR follows what each of them were doing in their individual ministries as they grew closer and closer to one another. Of primary concern for both of them was that their desire for each other not usurp the call each of them felt to mission work, so they took their time before making the decision to marry. Once they did, in Texas, the couple put their energies into getting back onto the mission field, and the book provides an engrossing account of the days that lead up to March 15, 2004. <br /> <br />Carrie is inspirational; there's no two ways about it. On top of losing her husband and three dear friends, her own body was gravely injured in the attack and she's had to undergo multiple surgeries to restore all that can be restored. And yet, there is a glow in her face, in her eyes, that reflects a passion for Christ that pain and suffering can't diminish. I saw it when I met her in person last summer, and I can see it in the pages of her book. <br /> <br />\\"I live my life without David, but am grateful for the time I had with him,\\" she writes. \\"The world is not our place of rest; it is a time to work and follow hard after Jesus. When we get home, we can rest. But for now, God is calling his children to share the gospel of the cross, the power of our Holy Father; it's time we obediently follow Him. May we all live our lives in a manner worthy of the calling we have received in Christ Jesus.

Neither extreme provides healthy, lasting relationships. The answer lies in resolving conflicts. Without the proper tools, however, this could lead to one side simply \\"giving in\\" only to harbor a resentment, keeping handy to use when the next conflict arises. PEACE MAKING WOMEN does an excellent and thorough job of providing not only the necessary tools but the Biblical rationale behind them as well.    God's senses of humor and irony are demonstrated as the authors confess the conflicts they faced while writing this book. Many will recognize this phenomenon that seems to happen whenever we start to teach on a certain topic. It seems that God allows us to experience the problem firsthand, which definitely lends authenticity to our work. Perhaps it is His gentle way of reminding us that He, not we, has all the answers.    In this case, the authors were able to demonstrate that the tools they were advocating really do work; that God's principles and truths are practical, useful and indispensable. Despite unrelenting pain and circumstances that threatened to scuttle the book and their friendship, God remained true. And, out of the ashes of their dead relationship, He brought new life. He created not only a better, stronger friendship but enhanced the lives of two individuals by filling them with love and grace based on the foundation of His love.    Tara Barthel and Judy Dabler describe how this incredible process begins with a peaceful relationship with God Himself. For many that will be a quantum leap that has never been taken. How does one presume to have a personal relationship with the awesome, omniscient Creator God? As in any relationship, you get to know Him. He reveals His character through His words, the words that are written down for all to study in the Bible. And, despite the seemingly complex nature of the Bible, itis simply captured in the greatest commandment of all: Love one another, even as I have loved you. Is there a more profound mantra anywhere?    PEACE MAKING WOMEN is not a little self-help book to be perused for quick fixes. Rather it is a key that allows you to enter a place where you can gather the tools you need to live a richer, more peaceful and fulfilled life. Just as peace is not merely the absence of war, a peace-filled life is not merely one with the absence of conflict. It is one filled with love, kindness, trust and compassion. What a wonderful Bible study it would make, complete with thought-provoking questions at the end of each segment.    (...)	2005-08-24

Yet authors David and Lisa Frisbie accomplish this unlikely task most successfully. <br /> <br />Given that about 90 million people in the United States are now living in a stepfamily, divorce and remarriage are no longer \\"fringe\\" societal patterns. Divorce, even within the church, is a reality that must be reckoned with and faced head on. Surprisingly, those couples entering a second (or third, or fourth) marriage frequently exhibit some measure of extra-forgiveness than they did during their first marriages. The authors cite that with first marriages the high emotional component of physical attractiveness and romantic feelings often play an inordinate role in the formation of the relationship, whereas in the subsequent marriages both partners appear to be more rationally based when deciding to remarry. The deeper attraction is rooted in similarity of political and religious views, life experiences, and compatible personality types. It is on this basis that the authors say a remarriage can thrive despite the high divorce statistics. <br /> <br />Forgiveness of those who have hurt individuals in the past sets the new partners free of unwanted baggage often evidenced by anger, resentment and bitterness. Learning to forgive in the present, as couples adjust to differences in attitudes and values, also offers a sense of safety and shelter so necessary in a loving relationship. Further, embracing an attitude of personal forgiveness for past mistakes is essential. Accepting God's pardon completely allows each partner to look to the future with a solid hope instead of wallowing in regret over past errors. <br /> <br />The authors expound at length upon four foundation principles that are essential to a successful remarriage relationship. They recommend that both partners form a spiritual connection based on serving God together, determine to view their marriage as permanent and irreversible, embrace blanket forgiveness as cited above, and understand that conflict can bring about a deeper, more substantial relational bond. <br /> <br />While this text is soundly inspirational, it is also practical. Readers will glean countless tidbits of insight as they read about numerous other couples who've been there, done that, with resistant stepchildren, conflicting modes of discipline, blending within a new family home, creating memorable traditions, and overcoming financial stresses. Perhaps one of the most helpful chapters covers the hot topic of the \\"X\\" factor, or, in other words, \\"strategies for dealing with your former spouse.\\" The authors remind the remarried that frequently well-behaved ex-spouses become jealous and angry when a former spouse gets married. These volatile emotions can play out in middle-school immature acts of purposefully withholding child support, being repeatedly late for picking up children, and becoming argumentative and aggressive. So what's an ex-spouse to do in the face of such behavior? Be the adult. Don't react in kind to such juvenile actions; rather, find ways to defuse them. Keep calm...at least be polite. Speak positively when the children are present, even when your emotions are groaning to vent. And make every effort to see interested, loving ex-in-laws as team players in raising your children. Tough call indeed. <br /> <br />Remarried couples and those individuals considering remarriage will find excellent counsel in this sensitively written text. Even those who have been married once will discover sound principles for deepening their marital relationship while simultaneously becoming more aware of the challenges their remarried friends and family members must face day to day as they seek to create a permanent, loving home environment. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-24

The gal who spread the gossip about you at church. What do we do about the difficult women in our lives? In MEAN GIRLS ALL GROWN UP, Hayley DiMarco offers some good and some arguable ideas for navigating through the relationships of women. She bases her advice on her own experiences, scripture, and spiritual heavyweights such as Richard Foster in a format that is younger-woman friendly.    Not a teenager or even a twenty- or thirty-something, but having had some recent conflicts with mean girls, I am intrigued by DiMarco's approach to the problem. However, I found there was much I disagreed with, and I would hesitate to give it to my daughter without one-on-one discussion and caveats about her advice. Read on.    The main goal, DiMarco believes, is to get the mean girl to leave us alone. To do this, she first helps us understand the mean girl's motivations. Does she perceive us as a rival? Does she believe we are somehow better than her? Does she gossip about us? If so, why?    Our response, she believes, is to keep our mouth shut and try not to justify ourselves to those mean girls we don't have a relationship with (pulling from the wisdom of Richard Foster's CELEBRATION OF DISCIPLINE). Feeling a need to adjust our image, she believes, is proof that we are serving humans rather than God. Rather confusingly, she admits there might be a time to make the truth known (if a lie is being spread about us at the office that we are stealing, for example) but not to the perpetrator. Instead, tell the supervisor. \\"The spiritual truth is that God never calls us to stand up for ourselves to the Mean Girl. Psychologists teach us that standing up for ourselves is healthy, but in my study of God's Word, I can't find any biblical support for this notion,\\" she writes. This is a very discussable point that many readers may take issue with.     If we consider the mean girl our friend, the advice seems more realistic. Talk to her aboutthe problem (her complaining, the gossip she spreads, her need for control). There may also be a time to bail out of the relationship, if the mean girl is unwilling to change.     Confusingly, although DiMarco eschews self-examination that isn't upwardly focused (\\"So much freedom comes in removing our eyes from self and placing them securely on the Father that any attempt at self-justification or analysis would be wasteful if not faithless.\\"), she prods women toward it through quizzes, questions (\\"What would you have done in that situation? \\"You have to be honest and really assess how you live, what you do, and how you do it.\\") What I came away with was the idea that as long as my self-examination is God-centered, I'm on the right track. Fair enough. It seems as if she advocates \\"dying to self,\\" which is admirable, and avoiding too much navel-gazing, also admirable.    However, it's not terribly clear how to balance the two, and the flow of information isn't always conducive to figuring it out. I ended the book feeling confused. There's a tendency, especially in the first half of the book, toward a \\"woman as doormat\\" tone that, in my understanding of scripture and myself as made in the image of God, doesn't work. Humbleness is good. Being a doormat is not. How do I know the difference? The second half seems stronger, as DiMarco urges girlfriends to talk things over and confront problems in love.    Despite some arguable points, there is some advice worth taking, including the reminder that changing mean women isn't our job; loving them and forgiving them is. Much of the power of a mean woman --- or a mean man, for that matter --- can be defused with those two simple actions. Also applaudable: Mean-free women are happy when their friends do well, they leave others feeling good about themselves, and they aren't afraid to confront their friends in love, they learn to let go of past hurts. Good advice.    The page layouts are twenty-something friendly, if sometimes a bit all over the place for this 44-year-old reviewer. Lots of pull-out quotes, short quizzes, and boxed tips (\\"Surviving the Mean Compliment Giver\\") will make this appealing to women whose acquaintance with reading revolves mainly around their laptop or the latest girl-friendly magazine.     There is solid value in DiMarco's call not to focus on our image, but to focus on God and how he helps us grow through difficult people. Yet, women might be better served to use this book in small groups with an eye to discussion and discernment rather than embracing the advice --- which is of mixed value --- as gospel truth.

She makes her publishing debut on a subject she knows well: the trials and triumphs of parenthood. THE VELVETEEN MOMMY is a lighthearted, humorous look at what it means to be a mom from pregnancy to those turbulent teenage years, written not just by someone who has been there, but by someone who is still there.    The title of the book is a takeoff of the children's classic THE VELVETEEN RABBIT and highlights a simple but powerful message: God often uses the process of having and raising children not only to make us more real but also to make us more like himself. It's a fresh reminder for moms who are feeling a little worn out or tired on their parenting journey.    Few topics are off-limits to Doucette, who explores everything from childbirth to the perils of trying to potty train a toddler. She writes, \\"Then there's potty training. Need I say more? Being in the potty-training stage is like traveling to the Twilight Zone. The child progresses then digresses. He's trained; he's not trained. And through the entire process, you've changed your tactics so many times that you can't remember if you're supposed to give them candy or money or a spanking when they actually go in the toilet.\\"    The author clearly isn't afraid of being \\"real,\\" sharing funny adventures at the gynecologist's office as well as her more heartfelt struggle with panic attacks. One chapter tenderly shares the story of staying up until morning with a sick child while another recounts the family's somewhat regrettable decision to raise chickens. Each chapter ties into a spiritual lesson or theme that reminds women to ultimately seek God's help and wisdom. The transitions to these spiritual moments are relatively smooth and convey messages of hope and heartfelt encouragement without being preachy. This is a book that you could give to nearly anyone and find a receptive audience (assuming the person is a parent!).    Throughout the book, readers will find little lists, ideas and suggestions. For example, the list of \\"The Top Ten Things I Learned About Having A Baby\\" include entries such as \\"The prudence of the phrase, 'Never wake a sleeping baby.'\\" And \\"That JC Penny sends out an average of three photo coupons per week.\\"    Doucette's writing is colorful and accessible, filled with countless little observations and ironies that come with being an American mom. She's more than willing to be self-deprecating for the sake of a laugh, and it's her humor that keeps this book rolling throughout. You just never know which way she is going to twist a phrase, expression or idea. The biggest weakness of the book is that it ends too soon --- at a mere 134 pages of reading material, it leaves readers asking for more. Yet even in such a short book, Doucette's love both for being a parent and for her children shine through.    [...]	2005-08-24

Everyone and everything is open for reinterpretation --- faces, closets, backyards, relationships --- in one hour or less via the magic of television. But as authors Linda Clare and Kristen Johnson Ingram point out in their new book, such transformations are often superficial and temporary. What women really long for is a total transformation that stems from an understanding of their spiritual identity. <br /> <br />REVEALED: Spiritual Reality in a Makeover World takes a focused look at the issues that affect a woman's soul and sense of being --- beauty, status, desire, stress, and community to name a few --- via essays, poems, and stories from a cadre of insightful women. Each topic is introduced by a conversation between Linda and Kristen that sets the honest \\"just between us girlfriends\\" tone that pervades the book. About wanting things they write: <br /> <br />Linda: People often look back on their \\"poor years\\" as the best times in their lives, but when they're going through those times, they feel awful. <br /> <br />Kris: Uh-huh. I remember when my husband and I were both finishing college, and we had three small children. He worked nights at an aircraft plant and I taught piano. Sometimes I cried at night because the kids didn't have the toys they wanted, and I bought my clothes at a thrift shop. Now that time is perfumed by sweet nostalgia. <br /> <br />Linda: What I don't get is why God lets us struggle and suffer to makes ends meet, and yet Jesus apparently wants us all to give everything to the poor and follow him. <br /> <br />Kris: I think the struggle is what brings you to God. To your knees. You don't understand, so you pray. And when you pray, you realized someone is making a demand on your attention. <br /> <br />Linda: The Rolling Stones sing that you get what you need. <br /> <br />Kris: I think I often choose what I need, without knowing it. I think God guides you to what will round out your life and personality --- not necessarily money. <br /> <br />Linda: Shh! I think I hear God whispering right now. <br /> <br />Contributions to the conversation by writers including Vinita Hampton Wright, Marlee LeDai, Melody Carlson, and Luci Shaw are also worth noting. In her essay about allowing herself to be totally spent in the service of God, Vinita writes candidly about how her marriage and sexual relationship with her husband was her first lesson in being consumed. \\"Sometimes now, twelve years into my marriage, I still fear the consuming intimacy of it. Sometimes now, several books into a writing career, I still walk wide circles around my writing chair and laptop. It's always a choice to approach the flames. To submit to the altar, the torch, and the burning will always be a supreme form of submission to not only a God who loves me but to a life that is truly mine and no one else's. As I lie down in the fire, I am entering some sanctuary of soul that is bright and bold and filled with beauty.\\" <br /> <br />In one of her essays, Linda describes the first group of Christian women she met when she started to attend church. They were earnest and loved God. But they read the Bible --- and not much else. While Linda longed for more intellectual stimulation, she sensed such pursuits were suspect. Thankfully, she's clearly come to incorporate her liberal arts (and pop culture) education with her faith as REVEALED makes references to everyone from Plato to Thoreau to Jung. As such, it's a broad-based, thinking woman's guide to evangelical Christian spirituality. <br /> <br />The idea for this book came out of a writers' conference, but the authors say they were in the process of actually writing the book when the ideas really started to flow. \\"We gained a heightened awareness of God's presence and felt the need to reach more deeply into our own spiritual lives. We've seen how some of the chapters became very expensive, for they cost us and the contributors something --- comfort, privacy,even sleep,\\" they write. The fruit of these labors is on the page and undoubtedly will grow in the hearts of many of the readers who take the time to honestly engage the ideas presented in REVEALED. It will take longer than an hour, but the results could last a lifetime. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-24

Journey with Losada as she tells of the seemingly endless trials and tribulations as a wannabe activist fighting for the religious freedom of Tibet. Interesting choice. Yet when the author explains her reasoning behind backing this particular cause, readers will fall into her line of thinking with a natural acceptance simply because Losada is so charming and sincere. Her expression of sadness over the rising regularity of terrorism worldwide is so commonly felt, so consistently lamented, that when Losada poses the premise of fighting the war on terror with nonviolence, it makes sense. Who then is the leading proponent of nonviolence? The Dalai Lama, of course. Losada determines that he's the man for her --- and on this basis Losada begins her story, her journey toward social activism. <br /> <br />Making use of the famed serenity prayer, Losada divides her text into three main sections. Part One: \\"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change...\\" Recognizing that she has never done much besides navel-gazing, Losada decides to invest some time in protesting outside the Chinese Embassy, a not particularly auspicious beginning. Next, the author starts investigating, interviewing, and finally traveling to Tibet. Waking up in Kathmandu, Losada details in comical fashion the advice passed along to her from a girl in the know from Tibet: Never squat down in the bushes on the Nepalese side of the Himalayas. Leeches have a way of attaching themselves. Before you know it, you're pouring with blood. <br /> <br />Sounds enchanting. Not to be daunted, Losada repeatedly hears the warning of altitude sickness, which can kill you. More seriously, though, were the injunctions to take extreme care in how one speaks to the Tibetan people regarding their loyalty to the Dalai Lama. And never, ever, hand out photos of the Dalai Lama as they're illegal. Losada does indeed travel and immerse herself in Tibetan culture where she sees both beauty and evil side by side, incongruously thriving together. Hard to accept. <br /> <br />\\"The courage to change the things I can...\\" comprises the second part of Losada's tale as she begins making advances in practical activism without much initial success. From approaching the Free Tibet Campaign organization to requesting and receiving an interview with a member of Parliament, from setting up a company, a website, to delving into the nitty-gritty of fundraising via parachuting for donations, Losada makes even the most dreary activities both humorous and sobering. <br /> <br />Finally, in Part Three, \\"And the wisdom to the know the difference...\\" Losada's journey becomes at once more introspective and profound as she receives an invitation to meet with the Dalai Lama. It is this portion of the text alone that will likely bring the most fascination to readers. Losada takes her time to carefully unfold the details of this once in a lifetime encounter and the results are most satisfying. <br /> <br />While Losada communicates with regular dashes of humor and wit, she likewise is serious about making a difference in the world. Even the most socially complacent readers will glean tips on how vital doing \\"one's bit\\" is to a better, safer, more peaceful world. As the Dalai Lama so succinctly states, \\"If the individual acts, society is changed.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-24

Author Sue Thompson had such a brother, her only and younger sibling, the kind who could have been a child candidate for the \\"Dr. Phil\\" show: full of fear and anger...trouble from the day he was prematurely born. \\"After a lengthy separation from his mother he was handed to her as though there was nothing wrong --- but in fact, everything was wrong and he never recovered...Who can understand why one child is broken and another endures? I believe my brother's little spirit was simply fragile from the beginning.\\" <br /> <br />With great honesty --- but from a distance --- Thompson weaves her own story through the book. She summarizes personalities and family patterns but rarely transports us to a scene. \\"My brother was completely without self-control...His language was shockingly foul, his friends were alarmingly gross, his hygiene was disgustingly indifferent. I remember my parents yelling and pleading and arguing with him, and I watched him win every time. Even when they seemed to win, they lost, because while their intentions remained steadfast, they just couldn't seem to follow through.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, Thompson always refers to him --- Danny --- in the past tense, as he died \\"a few years ago,\\" in his early forties, of heart disease exacerbated by \\"decades of drug and alcohol abuse.\\" Her mother has also died, and her father lives far away in the fog of Alzheimer's. These principal players being absent, the book's subtitle, \\"Making Peace with Your Parents, Your Past, and the Wayward One in Your Family,\\" refers more to making peace with the memories than to working out ongoing relationships with difficult prodigals or parents who have unintentionally caused great pain to the \\"faithful\\" child who stayed the course, prayed for peace, and longed for attention. \\"How should I have loved my brother? I still don't know. It's hard to imagine how I might have loved him rightly because I was not mature enough to understand the complexities of love.\\" <br /> <br />In sorting through painful memories, Thompson, who has a master's degree in clinical psychology, looks at her own culpability in the family dynamics, placing herself in the indignant, angry, self-righteous role of the \\"older brother\\" as portrayed in Jesus' prodigal parable. The problems she raises are familial. The answers she gives are spiritual. Citing Scripture and biblical life-stories, such as Hagar and Elijah, she lays out a journey from immaturity to maturity, from denial to grief over what might have been, to gratitude, and eventually hard-wrought forgiveness. <br /> <br />There's a lot of thought-provoking material here for adult children who've been wounded by well-meaning families. Though Thompson never hears anyone say, \\"I'm sorry,\\" she finds healing and offers every reader hope of the same. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-08-24

Sorting through his junk mail, Nick Cominsky almost accidentally tosses an anonymous letter that comes to his office in Cincinnati, Ohio. Strangely it is typed and has no return address, yet it uses Crane paper and a matching envelope. It says, \\"You are invited to a dinner with Jesus of Nazareth Milano's Restaurant Tuesday, March 24 - Eight o'clock.\\"    The invitation stumps Nick because he cannot figure out who could have possibly sent it. He has no relationship with a church or interest in anything related to organized religion. When Nick calls the restaurant, he can't get any answers about the origin of the invitation. He decides to play it cool and not say anything to anyone but to show up for the invitation.    When Nick walks into the restaurant, the maitre d' leads him to a table where a thirty-something man in a blue business suit is looking over the menu. He introduces himself as Jesus. The encounter begins a modern-day encounter with Jesus Christ through the eyes of a skeptic.     The various events of a dinner form the chapters for this short book, including The Menu, The Appetizer, The Salad, The Main Course, The Dessert, The Coffee, and the Bill. Each section allows Nick to question this stranger about some of the key questions about life, such as pain, faith and doubt.    As in a real spiritual situation, Jesus never pressures Nick but simply is available and patiently answers his questions throughout the meal. The book is like eavesdropping on a back and forth conversation with an unbeliever explaining the reality of Jesus Christ.    Here's an example of their conversation:    Nick says, \\"Just because you claim to be God doesn't mean that you are.\\"    \\"No. But it does mean that I wasn't just a good religious teacher. Either I told the truth about who I am, or I lied, or I was insane. Those are the only real options. Good religious teachers don't claim to be God.\\"    He looked off across the room, not seeming to focus on anything in particular. He shook his head almost imperceptibly, then looked back at me. \\"People distort the truth because they reject the final proof I've already given.\\"    \\"What's that?\\"    \\"That I rose from the dead.\\"     Step by step Jesus answers Nick's big questions about life. Nick moves toward becoming a Christian, yet the ending isn't totally predictable. Hesitant to conclude the evening, Nick wonders if he will ever have another opportunity with Jesus for dinner. He smiles and says it depends on Nick. Then Jesus asks Nick to give him the last business card in his wallet. He scribbles something on the back and returns the card to Nick saying, \\"That'll tell you how to reach me.\\"    As Nick shakes hands to say goodbye, he notices the scar on his wrists and reluctantly departs. The card simply says \\"Revelation 3:20.\\" At home, Nick rummages around for a Bible and turns to the Scripture. He learns how he can have dinner with Jesus again.    Every fiction story plays the \\"What if\\" game, in which the author sets up a particular character and a trial or problem that hopefully is resolved through the novel. DINNER WITH A PERFECT STRANGER, subtitled \\"An Invitation Worth Considering,\\" has the central theme of \\"What if you could spend an evening with Jesus?\\" While the conversation is imagined, it is realistic in the types of objections raised and how they are patiently answered in the book. While cloaked in fiction, this little book is catching on in the marketplace as a popular tool. The story and format alone become a simple apologetic message for pre-evangelism yet couched in a highly readable format.    I recommend DINNER WITH A PERFECT STRANGER. For Christians, it will sharpen your insight into how to talk about your faith in today's world.       --- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin, writer and editor in Scottsdale, Arizona.

LOVING LIBBY is an inspiring story that pits the lust for power and revenge against the love of God and His eternal truths. Through the love and faith of one young woman, God changes lives proving His grace again and again.    Olivia Vanderhoff has run away from her opulent home in Manhattan because she saw no other way to escape the forced marriage that her father had planned for her. To satisfy his lust for power, Northrop Vanderhoff was willing to betroth his only daughter to an elderly drunk and womanizer in order to procure control of valuable railroads. After some wandering, Olivia met Aunt Amanda Blue who invited her to Blue Springs and there she found her new life as Libby Blue.    The story opens six years later at the Blue Springs Ranch in the Idaho Territory in 1890. Aunt Amanda has passed away and Libby is trying to keep the ranch out of the clutches of Timothy Bevins, a wealthy neighbor who is attempting to buy up all the land surrounding his property. He will stop at nothing and has already caused the death of the ranch foreman, leaving his 10-year-old son orphaned. But Sawyer Deevers, like Libby, has found a home and proves to be a willing hand on the sheep ranch.    When Remington Walker rides out of the woods, rifle in hand, Libby thinks it is Bevins and shoots him twice. As she approaches the wounded man, she sees that it is a stranger. Libby is wracked with guilt, so she takes him in and tends to his wounds. What she doesn't know is that this man may pose even more of a threat to her than Bevins. Walker was hired by her father to find her and promised a $250,000 bonus when the task was completed.    As he slowly recovers from his wounds, Remington becomes enchanted with this beautiful young woman who shows such courage and strength. Her faith in God inspires him to examine his own thoughts of revenge, and soon it becomes impossible for him to contemplate betraying her. Remington's journey back to his faith sparks a series of misunderstandings that threaten to throw their lives into chaos, but all things work together for good for those who love the Lord. And Robin Lee Hatcher is not one to mess with that truth.    Enjoy LOVING LIBBY and then pass it on to a favorite young woman in your life.

At 400-plus pages, it's a long --- perhaps too long --- read. However, Heitzmann's competent writing keeps the pages turning.    The story swings back between the grandmother Nonna Antonia's life in 1931 and the present time, with Antonia sometimes remembering incidents in first-person point of view. It's a difficult thing to pull off, but Heitzmann handles it fairly well. Nonna Antonia's childhood home and vineyard are now the scene of her handsome grandson Lance Michelli's work as a chef at a B&B. He's fallen in love with the seemingly cold Rese Barrett, a welcome and an unusual female CBA protagonist who excels at construction and renovation, but mostly fails at relationships. Her fears about the schizophrenia that runs in her family helps make her a sympathetic character rather than a forbidding or one-dimensional woman.    Lance lures Rese, his \\"business partner\\" from Sonoma, California, back to his childhood home in Little Italy in the Bronx of New York City. Here, his lively extended Italian family lives together in rooms over Nonna's family restaurant, Bella Tabella. It's in the Bronx that Rese peels back the layers of who Lance really is and discovers the joys and foibles of large, chaotic family life.    Other storylines from SECRETS play out as well. Star struggles with love, acceptance, and her artistic gifts while acting out in destructive ways to deal with pain. Lance discovers a vendetta or curse against his family that must be dealt with --- by revenge? He must balance his family loyalties with his strong Christian faith and desire to please God while putting the past to rest.    Readers may find Lance's unusual healing powers a little spooky and contrived, and Heitzmann never really explores them in any depth in this installment. Some readers will find Lance's theology of suffering over Tony's death open to discussion: \\"Either I accept that this was His purpose, that He intended to take Tony and leave me and somehow it was right and perfect, or I despair and curse Him.\\" Nonna Antonia's semi-recovery toward the end of the novel is a little difficult to believe, as she goes from being unable to say \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" to communicating in sentences. There also are a few longwinded romantic clichs: \\"Her resistance shattered as he made his point until she wondered how she had doubted the possibility of connection, because in those moments she could hardly tell where Lance left off and she started.\\"    That said, Heitzmann is one of the best at depicting sexual attraction between characters in Christian fiction --- and the women are as capable of passion as the men. Her rich culinary details will make readers salivate. Some of the delights of this story are Heitzmann's characterizations --- the multifaceted Italian family with a lovable momma who can't cook but insists on trying, the pack of unruly kids, and a father who has a surprising heart-to-heart talk with Lance over two bottles of Bud. The last pages of the story set up themes for a possible sequel that, if written, should be eagerly anticipated by fans of the series.    (...)	2005-08-23

Interesting characters, rich cultural details, the expected romance, and an intriguing plot combine to make this an enjoyable read.    The story opens in the Year of the Ancients, 952, as the beautiful (of course!) captive Danae watches from the Fortress of Astara as her own people battle for possession of the town. Her feelings about their victory are mixed, as she has fallen hard for the handsome (of course!) and heroic Crown Prince Vartan of the royal family Karayan. But alas --- Vartan is married to the troubled elfin maiden Aelwyd, who teeters on the brink of madness. Danae feels torn between her love for Vartan and her loyal companionship to Aelwyd and her little son, Korien. But Danae senses that she and Vartan \\"in some curious way...were bound to each other, their lives and fates intertwined.\\"    The story turns violent. Ladon has turned over his soul to Phaon, the Dark Lord, and the supernatural powers of darkness aid him in victory. By the end of the first chapter, Ladon wipes out most of the royal family and Vartan is left blind, with Danae leading him to safety. Morgan does an excellent job portraying the relentless powers of evil, including showing how these forces play out in the life of the grasping Hovan, who steals another man's beautiful wife and queen. \\"In his apparently endless quest to fill that strange, insatiable hole in his heart, Hovan couldn't seem to help himself.\\"    Dwarves and elves, dragons and a race of demonic netherworldly imps called Pedars (think of Tolkien's orcs) populate the narrative. Portals to other places open and close, and magical doings help keep the pages turning. Perhaps Morgan's most compelling invention is the dragonmaids, a formidable community of virgins who (nun-like) swear vows to Athan, the All-Knowing and the Creator, and His precious son,Eisa. (Christian readers won't fail to miss the allegory here, nor the crucifixion allusions in the first battle). The maidens form a life-bond with their enchantingly beautiful dragons, who fly them into battle when called upon.    And called upon they are. As Vartan gains the allegiance of the Diya al Din --- the Desert people --- and romance and intrigue muddy the waters even more, the battle moves closer. Can they defeat the supernatural powers of evil that propel Ladon and his men? It's not long before the meaning of Vartan's name, \\"giver of roses,\\" becomes clear as he is poised to fulfill prophecy.    Fantasy novels tend to run long, and Morgan's is no exception. For some readers used to the short, sweet romances of Christian fiction, there may be trouble spots. Morgan doesn't shy away from violence, and Ladon's dark sexual usage of Ankine, a sorceress, could surprise gentle readers. Passages can become a bit wordy or be a little overly detailed. There's also a scenario between Ladon and Danae recalling their attraction to one another that seems contrived without more of an earlier set-up.    However, fantasy fans used to the length, descriptives, and violence/sexual edginess of the genre will find Morgan's imaginary world compelling. Morgan ends her novel with plenty of loose ends dangling, leaving the reader anticipating the next installment.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. Contact Cindy [...]	2005-08-23

Bell is the founding pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, one of the fastest growing churches in America. He launched the church in 1999 by preaching out of the book of Leviticus. A thousand people came the first Sunday. Within a few short months, more than 4,000 attended. Today, there are more than 10,000.    Now this unconventional pastor-teacher-turned-author is making a splashy publishing debut with VELVET ELVIS: Repainting the Christian Faith. If you think the white plain cover with retro-80s, neon-earthy orange is a bit disarming, just wait until you \\"jump\\" into the first chapter, or rather \\"movement,\\" as the book is divided. Bell goes for the fundamentalist jugular by questioning the trinity and the virgin birth in the first 27 pages. Though he embraces both doctrines, his point is that often as Christians we get snared in the small issues, missing the gigantic truth that following Jesus is the best possible way to live.    Through the seven movements that compose VELVET ELVIS, he supports that principle by reflecting on different aspects of faith and the teachings of Jesus. He refracts the light of basic Biblical lessons by looking at them through the lenses of various cultural and historical understandings. For example, what it means to be a follower of Christ is examined in the light of what it meant to follow a rabbi in Jesus' day. From this context, we learn what the invitation to follow Christ really means, according to Bell. Suddenly a faith journey isn't about saying a prayer but becoming like the one who calls. Powerfully deep truths are presented in a simple but surprisingly fresh manner. Bell paints Christianity --- with all its highlights and lowlights --- in a way that at times makes you question, at times makes you doubt, and at times just makes sense. Undoubtedly, this book will create controversy.    But it isn't just the cover of Bell's book or his message that are disarming, it's also his writing style. It's both raw and honest and lacks many of the common Christian clichs. It asks tough questions and wrestles with touchy issues. Bell manages to be bold and vulnerable without being too revealing.    This author is king of the one-word and one-sentence paragraph.    Really.    A few of the chapters sound a little too transcribed from his most popular talks and NOOMA DVDs, but Bell is a gifted enough communicator that he's able to pull it off. In the places where his writing style runs flat, his provocative message glosses over.    At one point Bell writes, \\"This is what we are all dying for --- something that demands we step up and become better, more focused people. Something that calls out the greatness that we hope is somewhere inside of us.\\"    In the end, that is the message Bell delivers. It rings loud and clear. Anyone who has ever looked at or been a part of the church and thought to themselves, \\"Something has got to give,\\" will be both encouraged and challenged by VELVET ELVIS. Maybe the resounding message is that the something that's got to give most of all...is us.       --- Reviewed by Margaret Feinberg [...]	2005-08-23

These people don't wear black just for funerals; they wear black as a part of their religious group, The Elect. The reader enters Dinah's controlled world and the high expectations for behavior of every aspect of her life. Yet something isn't right from the beginning chapter when Dinah slips away to the family barn and vomits her supper to expose her bulimia.    This closed culture around a small town, Hamilton Falls in Washington State, begins to change with an act of kindness to a stranger, Dr. Matthew Nicholas. Like any homeless man, Nicholas, actually a former university literature professor, knocks on the Traynell backdoor and asks for some food. Dinah decides to feed him a day later to hire him to help with work around the farm. The Traynell family is one of the \\"favored\\" families in this culture, which means the Shepherd for the flock, Phinehas, often visits the home and stays the night.    These visits from Phinehas trigger Dinah's. Under the cloak of spiritual leadership, Phinehas has consistently sexually abused Dinah since she was fourteen. The life and the secrecy are frightening and Dinah feels like she can't escape.    \\"After ten years, she [Dinah] still marveled --- in a faint, homeless kind of way --- that no one knew. She had kept their little secret. The ugliness. The pain and degradation. All were locked inside her body with no way out. No way to ask for help. And so. Of course, no one saw --- or wanted to see. No one cared. Not even God.\\"    When Dinah's younger sister becomes pregnant, Tamela is \\"Silenced\\" so that no one in the Elect can speak to her for seven years. She leaves the community and has her baby. Suddenly Tamela arrives at the family home with her four-month-old child, Tamsen, and leaves the baby in Dinah's care. Eventually the story reveals that Phinehas is the father of Tamela's child. Later, Dinah learns that Phinehas is more than her sexual abuser. Her mother, Elsie, reveals that the \\"Shepherd\\" is Dinah's father. Years earlier, this spiritual leader abused Elsie and she became pregnant with Dinah. The information helps Dinah understand why Elsie's husband allowed Phinehas's continual sexual abuse pattern.    Matthew Nicholas looks homeless but he's actually fleeing a false sexual abuse charge from a student at his university in California. Ultimately he is proven innocent and begins a walking trip. On the trip, Matthew is robbed of his possessions and becomes homeless when he meets Dinah.    Early on in the story, Dinah grows discouraged with life and decides to end her life by drowning in a nearby river. Matthew follows and rescues Dinah. The experience forms a bond of trust, so she confides in him and reveals a part of the culture and lifestyle that no one has ever known. The new relationship gives Dinah someone to help her understand her world and escape the rigid culture. Matthew becomes a friend and listening ear for Dinah so she can flee this toxic church situation. Through displaying a real relationship with Christ, Matthew helps Dinah understand the true spiritual life found in the Bible.    Readers will be lost in the vivid world that Shelley Bates paints with incredible detail and masterful storytelling. Ultimately, through the story, readers learn the distinction between a religious life of rules and a true relationship with Christ. The characters ring with realism in their speech and flawed personalities. The resolutions of the mountain of difficulties will help readers learn how to handle their own struggles.       --- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin, writer and editor in Scottsdale, Arizona.

But that's what happens with BAD GROUND, which in July deservedly won the Christy Award for a contemporary novel released in 2004. W. Dale Cramer is such a marvelous writer that he manages to appeal to both male and female readers --- no mean feat in the general market and a nearly impossible one in the gender-targeted world of CBA fiction. <br /> <br />With nothing but a duffel bag and $63 to his name, 17-year-old Jeremy Prine sets out from Tennessee to find his Uncle Aiden, who disappeared from the family radar screen a decade earlier after an accident in which he was disfigured and Jeremy's father was killed. All Jeremy knows is that his uncle works in a hard-rock tunnel for a company in Atlanta, which is where Jeremy heads the day after his mother's funeral. His quest is less his than his mother's; in a letter she wrote before she died --- and that Jeremy read after she died --- she urges him to do whatever it takes to find his uncle. Teenager that he is, he hitchhikes and walks until he finds the man who is now known as Snake. <br /> <br />You can pretty well assume that with a name like Snake, this guy isn't exactly elated when Jeremy appears at his work site. But the kid is family, and even though he'd rather forget the family and everything his nephew represents, Snake takes him in and gets him a job with the tunneling operation. It's dangerous and gritty work that's tough on even the coarse, grizzled miners who have been at it for years; for a young guy like Jeremy, who was reared by his mother in a sheltered environment, the mine represents an alien world in which he must somehow find his way. It doesn't help, given the rough lives and language of the miners, that Jeremy is openly Christian. Or maybe it does. <br /> <br />What Cramer does with that storyline is nothing short of extraordinary. You think you know where the story is going, but that's not where it goes. You try really hard not to like Snake, but you can't help yourself. You're so sure that Jeremy's faith is going to intrude on an otherwise wonderful book, but it never does. And you don't know a thing in the world about mining, but you get all wrapped up in the technical descriptions, and you decide, despite your ignorance, that it all rings true. Most of all, you are astonished that such a delicate story can be told in such a harsh setting. <br /> <br />Cramer creates a richly textured and highly detailed world in which three-dimensional people work and play, love and hate, ignore each other and interact with each other. I'm telling you, these people are real. I know each and every one of them, and I'm guessing you do too --- even if, like me, you've never been near the kind of environment they live in. The author clearly knows human nature and knows it well. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Cramer is a brilliant writer, positively brilliant. This is one of those novels that makes you utter those words every author longs to hear: \\"You've got to read this book.\\"	2005-08-23

It wasn't long before her inner misgivings were proven correct. <br /> <br />An angry displaced passenger began berating Taylor for his delayed flight; as the altercation rose, airport police arrived to handcuff the man but not before Taylor faces him off. On this dismal note, Taylor is asked to leave her post --- but what no one knew was that this single standoff would catapult a series of events that would forever change Taylor and those who lay within her path. <br /> <br />Enter perpetually dueling brothers Aaron and Mick Kline. The former is a police officer, a Christian, and the good boy of the pair; the latter is the handsome black sheep and rebellious brother. After a physical battle of both the will and the body, the brothers retreat per usual and go their separate ways, each licking his own particular wounds. What neither realizes is that a single choice will force both of them to face up to their past, their present, and their future as brothers and as men. <br /> <br />Of course, this duo must be battling over something significant --- and that something has a name: Jenny, the now fiance of Aaron and former girlfriend of Mick. Despite their ongoing terse and tense interactions, both Aaron and Mick understand that it isn't only Jenny who's been the dividing wall between them. It's God --- Aaron's God --- and Mick's resistance to anything pertaining to matters of faith. <br /> <br />With this foundation of exploited emotions and scarred psyches in place, author Rene Gutteridge sets the scene for a tale of suspense and intrigue. She skillfully employs both realistic dialogue and believably sympathetic characters to assist her as she weaves a story about loss of hope --- in God and in people --- and a revisiting of this faith amidst horrific and terrifying circumstances. <br /> <br />Within a carefully constructed framework, Mick and Taylor meet and find some tenuous common bond of suffering between them. After an evening together, Mike awakens in Taylor's apartment only to find Taylor missing. It doesn't take long before the absent Taylor brings about some suspicions and Mick is the obvious suspect. Though this plot isn't necessarily fresh, Gutteridge does a nice job keeping the action moving with interesting twists between the characters. She has readers guessing as to who is responsible for Taylor's disappearance and does a particularly fine job of not giving away too much information...just enough to have readers contemplating what may have occurred. <br /> <br />By bringing in some oddball characters in the guise of an eccentric police officer, a lawyer who has his obvious life issues, and other assorted dysfunctional supporting roles, Gutteridge makes the journey lively and sets the stage for a continued storyline.

Jo Tulip, short for Josephine Tulip, answers these types of household problems in a syndicated newspaper column called \\"Tips from Tulip,\\" which she took over writing from her grandmother. While Jo can easily solve these types of situational problems, her personal life is in continual crisis.    Tulip lives in Mulberry Glen, Pennsylvania, a small town where it's relatively easy to know other people's business. In the opening pages, Jo goes out for a late night jog to ease her tension from a house full of relatives and her forthcoming wedding to Bradford Bosworth. The couple had a whirlwind romance and engagement, and now the wedding is the next day. While on her run, Jo overhears an angry voice from Edna Pratt's home, which even at that late hour is well lit yet the shades are drawn.    On the morning of her wedding, Jo's best friend and neighbor, photographer Danny Watkins, feels free to call her to help the local police. Danny is taking crime scene photos where someone has died. The police can't identify a strange chemical in a bucket near the body and Danny suggests that Jo Tulip may have the answer. Jo arrives at the house where she heard the argument the night before and learns of the death of her neighbor, Edna Pratt. At first the police consider Edna's death a \\"strange\\" suicide, but Jo and Danny suspect foul play and spend the rest of the book proving that Edna Pratt has been murdered. Eventually the reader learns that Edna and her brother Simon are involved in a complex con game with some of Mulberry Glen's elderly women. Simon has convinced these women that he is hundreds of years old yet appears to look young because of a fountain of youth elixir.    In this first \\"Smart Chick Mystery,\\" Mindy Clark has created a multi-dimensional and layered plot where separate strands are eventually woven into a solid story. Clark has created believable characters who are flawed and struggling with life. During the wedding, Bradford suddenly runs out of the ceremony and jilts Jo Tulip at the altar in front of her friends and relatives. Her strained relationship with her parents is another dimension that readers will easily identify with. I loved the twists and turns in the plot. Christian readers will appreciate the spiritual dimensions built into the fiber of the storytelling. A fun dog named Chewie is mixed into a great package.    At one point early on in the story, Jo is trying to convince the police about the murder:    \\"I'm Jo Tulip,\\" she said aloud, confidently, as she pushed off with her Rollerblades. \\"I have a solution for every situation.\\"    Just as quickly she stopped again, one house over, and looked back at Edna's place, wavering just a bit.    \\"Correction,\\" she said to herself, more softly this time, \\"I have a solution for every situation...except my own love life and, oh yea, the dead body next door.\\"    Clark's pacing is terrific for a mystery suspense book. As a reader you think you've figured out the murderer, but then you are pointed in a different direction. Readers will quickly turn the pages as Jo searches for the solution.    As a male reader, I'm not normally reading green and pink cover books with tulips on the cover. I understand it is designed for a younger (and female) reader, yet the book caught my attention from the very first page. Soon I forgot about the cover and concentrated on the misadventures of Jo Tulip. I recommend THE TROUBLE WITH TULIP to anyone who loves a good mystery.       --- Reviewed by W.

Occasional anecdotes lighten the text, but it is largely substantive teaching material that requires careful reading. I suggest digesting a self-contained chapter a day rather than attempting a straight-through read. Eighteen chapters --- most hooked to a specific biblical text --- are presented under three part-sections: \\"The Call to Worship,\\" \\"The Power of Worship,\\" and \\"The Pursuit of Worship,\\" which covers the spiritual as well as the physical postures of worship. One needs to get past the table of contents and into the text to determine which chapters relate primarily to personal worship and which to church worship, some chapters being addressed to pastors and worship leaders. <br /> <br />One recurring theme is that \\"worship confronts carnal pride\\" and moves us beyond what \\"others might think\\" of our robust but imperfect singing, our raised hands, our bent knees. <br /> <br />A second topic, covered in each of the three parts, is worship and song. In an early chapter, \\"Worshiping Him Who Is Worthy,\\" Hayford wishes that more contemporary worship songs focused on Jesus, and he critically distinguishes between worship music and concert music. A particularly delightful \\"power of worship\\" chapter, titled \\"With Voices Loud and High,\\" discusses the role and power of song. \\"When we worship God in song, the power of darkness --- in every area of our lives and in every circumstance in our world --- is challenged.\\" Then music comes up again in the \\"pursuit of worship\\" section, where Hayford notes: \\"From my observation, there is usually not more than one song a year that is introduced into the life of the church that really has ongoing durability.\\" And yet he urges a congregation \\"to have a prayerful and studied inflow of new songs.\\" After all, Scripture repeats \\"Sing unto the Lord a new song\\" eight times. <br /> <br />Another interesting chapter discusses the spiritual power of two words that invite God's rule in our lives: grace and amen. \\"Amen is no ordinary word to be bandied about...Neither does it deserve to be intoned passively at the conclusion of prayers,\\" Hayford says. \\" 'Amen' is the establishing of the living Word of God in the arena of human enterprise and experience for the glory of Jesus Christ.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-08-23

If you haven't read Kelly's earlier books --- JULIA'S HOPE, EMMA'S GIFT and KATIE'S DREAM --- put this review down now and read them first. In JULIA'S HOPE, we are introduced to Samuel and Julia Wortham and their young family as they come to Illinois during hard times, looking for work and a place to live. Through the generosity of the elderly Emma Graham (EMMA'S GIFT), they find stability of sorts and community on a farm in rural Illinois. KATIE'S DREAM explores issues of trust as the Worthams add another child to their family. The Hammond family, with its multitude of rag-tag children living on a neighboring farm, provides plenty of chaos to keep the story chugging along.    ROREY'S SECRET takes place over a few days, but there are plenty of crises. Sam Hammond's wife Thelma arrives at their house with their two-year-old active toddler, Georgie, just in time to go into labor with their second child. The doctor is nowhere to be found (a stock device in so many novels). It's up to Julia to deliver the baby. Meanwhile, 13-year-old Rorey Hammond is up to no good with 18-year-old bad boy Lester Turrey, whose influence bodes ill for the young girl. When the Hammonds' barn and crops go up in flames, Rorey's best friend Sarah Wortham realizes that a secret Rorey has told her could hold the answer as to who is responsible. Samuel Wortham is injured in the fire, and the rest of the story revolves around his recovery (which takes place in an unbelievably short time).    Without proof of who caused the fire, the scripture-spouting Franky serves as a scapegoat. He also serves as a Christ-figure, even down to the wounds in both hands and his talent at carpentry, but the allegory is obvious rather than subtle. Franky seems too good to be true, and moredimension in his portrayal would have been welcome.    This recent offering in the Illinois family saga shows evidence that the Worthams' story may be wearing a bit thin. The many changes in points of view from chapter to chapter, which worked well in JULIA'S HOPE, seem almost superfluous here --- one wonders if a single narrator could have made for a more powerful read. Kelly has done a good job in earlier novels letting the characters carry the story, but the reliance on too many big crises (childbirth, a fire, a life-threatening injury) too fast, and a father (George Hammond) who seems too gullible and unfeeling to be credible mar this installment.    These problems aside, Kelly does a good job examining the response of conscientious children to tragedy (Sarah believes that her father's injury is her fault, since she hid Rorey's secret). Kelly once again also wrestles with the problem of bad things that happen to good people through the character of Julia. \\"Why Lord? Why did this have to happen? Samuel's been so good. And he's gone through so much in his life. It doesn't seem right.\\" Anyone who has watched a good family go through hard times will resonate with her feelings.    Readers of the series will enjoy the happy ending that brings various estranged family members back together after years apart. Although this is the weakest of the four books in the series, Kelly's loyal readership will enjoy catching up with the lives of the characters.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

Realizing that this is Tony's big career break, how can Kathleen say no? Especially since their daughter is in college, and this mid-life mom realizes she can use a jump into the unknown...or down under. Sadly, real life rarely falls in line with one's preconceptions and dreamy illusions, which Kathleen discovers immediately after landing in the country recently renowned for hobbits and assorted other worldly inhabitants. <br /> <br />Checking out their miniscule bungalow-style house, Kathleen spies some jumbo-sized men's briefs, displayed in all their glory on a drying rack within the confines of her new bathroom. Making light of this surprising addition to their compact living quarters, Kathleen soon realizes that for the next three months she'll be going without a clothes dryer, a car, Cheerios, or a friend to share a bowl over. By the second week of self-pity, she experiences an epiphany-like moment by way of a bike, her husband's concern, and a question. Kathleen, understandably overwhelmed by \\"primitive\\" life in New Zealand, realizes Tony's past sacrifices on her behalf --- and suddenly longs to give back to him the gift of contentment in spite of herself. With obvious relief, Tony heads back to his day job and Kathleen makes it her task to find the gumption within to make the most of this temporary jaunt into understanding her uncharacteristically hesitant mindset. <br /> <br />With thoughts of lovely chocolate invading her awakening subconscious, Kathleen ventures beyond the local grocery to a coffee shop named The Chocolate Fish, where she is initiated into the charming local custom of doing something well in exchange for a chocolate fish, a four-inch long marshmallow sweet treatthat has Kathleen smiling despite herself. When good things occur, the space is often small between them...and in Kathleen's case this truism is no exception. <br /> <br />While she sits sipping her mocha, Kathleen greets and meets another Californian native, Jill, with whom she shares the same hometown, two orange trees, and best of all, renewed hope. Jill and the newly dubbed Kathy become soul mates from the get-go and traverse the city, the country, and even Australia during Kathleen's stay. During their wanderings both women unveil their hearts and fears, and learn to accept their ever-altering life transitions, secure that God's love is guiding their steps. Each friend offers something the other has need of, perspective and a gentle generosity of spirit. <br /> <br />By the end of the allotted three months down under, Kathleen is surprised how grievous she feels to leave her newly adopted home. Yet, through the lessons she gleans from her New Zealand friends, her realization of life's constant change, and a subtle yet powerful shift in her spirit, Kathleen understands that no matter where she finds her home, those she loves remain with her --- and there's no better comfort than this. <br /> <br />Robin Jones Gunn makes traversing mid-life seem almost welcoming, because she has that rare gift of communicating hope amidst trial and inner chaos. Not one to shirk the need for self-assessment, this author has found an effective mode of gently lending some instruction to women who sometimes feel overwrought and undone by life's unexpected curves. Women and older teens will relish this newest installment in Gunn's Sisterchicks series. Who says growing older can't be fun if you have a friend to share the journey? <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-23

It's a powerful story of forgiveness, reconciliation and grace, wrapped up in a genuine page-turner. And if you've never read Kingsbury before, this is the one to start with. <br /> <br />The promotional material from Zondervan, including the synopsis on the back cover, refers to the \\"perfect\\" life of airline captain Connor Evans and his wife, Michele, and their two daughters. Frankly, that word is an immediate turn-off for me; it implies shallow, stereotyped characters, an overdone scenario, and unimaginative writing. If I hadn't been assigned to read this book, I probably would have ignored it. <br /> <br />The Evanses may have a decent and privileged life, but it's not a perfect life, the kind populated with cardboard characters. These are real people who happen to have it pretty good until an airline crash in the Pacific shakes things up for them in Florida. That's when Connor discovers that an indiscretion years earlier resulted in more than a good time. He has a son, and he has a choice: forget about him and pretend the one-night stand with the boy's mother never happened, or come clean with his wife, meet his son, Max, for the first time, and make Max a part of their family, at least temporarily. <br /> <br />One of the elements that sets this book apart is the light hand the author uses throughout. She skillfully weaves in the faith message and allows the story to unfold naturally. It's not until late in the book that we learn the circumstances that led to Connor's unfaithfulness; it would have been so easy, and ultimately so unsatisfying to the reader, to place those scenes early on in the book in an effort to simply get them out of the way. Nothing about OCEANS APART feels \\"wrong\\"; even the Florida setting rings true, which isn't always the case in the hands of non-native writers. <br /> <br />The forgiveness theme in particular never feels forced or superficial. So much forgiveness is needed on so many levels, and Kingsbury lets the process that leads to forgiveness develop over time. Equally impressive is the way she handles the theme of \\"second chances,\\" and not just with regard to the obvious second chance that Connor needs. All of this reflects a multilayered effort on the author's part, and one that she carries off well. <br /> <br />Readers who have found some of Kingsbury's plots to be implausible --- ONE TUESDAY MORNING and its sequel, BEYOND TUESDAY MORNING, come to mind --- should be pleasantly surprised with the achingly realistic story line in OCEANS APART. And the characters --- you just may find yourself loving Max and respecting each of the major characters, along with the decisions they end up making. <br /> <br />OCEANS APART won the ECPA Gold Medallion Award for fiction, which means it was selected as the best novel of 2004 by both retailers and a panel of independent judges. It's certainly the best, or among the best, from Kingsbury, and the accolades it has received should encourage her to maintain the higher standard she set for herself with this book.	2005-08-23

She is the mother to Sema, a gorilla whom she rescued from its birth mother when the new mom didn't begin feeding Sema immediately. Glee, a zookeeper, feared Sema's mother might eat her --- something gorillas have been known to do. <br /> <br />Thus began Glee's journey into full-time motherhood. Living off an inheritance from her parents' estate, this single woman has devoted all her time, energy, and very person into Sema's growth and development. Believing Sema to be special --- for she uses a computer, signs to communicate, watches videos, and expresses emotions, playfulness and sadness (as well as the rest of humanity's wide range of \\"attitude\\") --- Glee is determined to keep \\"her girl\\" out of the clutches of a zoo environment. <br /> <br />Sadly, after eight years of rearing and loving Sema on her private land, the director of the Thousand Oaks Zoo sees Sema as a moneymaker and demands her return. Even though Glee is crushed by this development, her lawyer-brother helps to negotiate better terms for both Sema and Glee. Surprisingly, Glee is offered a position at the zoo and this allows her at least daily minimal contact with Sema. For Glee this job comes with an old \\"boyfriend,\\" Brad Fielding, who's now her boss. Glee doubts whether or not she or he will be able to mend their fences, professional or otherwise. Still, Glee agrees to transport Sema to the zoo's facilities to begin her orientation with the other gorillas. <br /> <br />As Sema is quarantined for a short period of time, Glee is shocked to discover how excited Sema is to be acquainted with her fellow gorillas, signing these requests daily. As the days pass, Glee also is confounded by her boss's conciliatory behavior. Hmmm...Glee suddenly discovering much of her orderly world is not what she anticipated. <br /> <br />After a tragic water accident that may have killed Sema, Glee is even more disturbed by Sema's \\"signing.\\" Sema begins telling Glee of a \\"shiny man\\" who was with her in the dark water, who loves her...and loves Glee. Believing Sema to have suffered brain damage, Glee seeks out Brad and together they sneak Sema from the zoo for an MRI scan. When the results show no brain damage, Glee's grandmother ponders the possibility that God may be speaking to Sema. Glee, dismissing the notion offhandedly, continues to fret for Sema's mental health. <br /> <br />Between the overzealous zoo director's publicity ploys and Glee's ongoing concern for Sema, tensions escalate to a point where Glee must face the possibility of not having all the answers. She revisits her faith briefly, and yet niggling thoughts continue to point to the possibility of Sema's having a \\"spiritual\\" understanding beyond what Glee does. Another tragedy ensues, Glee and Sema converse, and Glee makes peace with her unspoken fears and doubts about God, his goodness, and the evil in the world. <br /> <br />Author Angela Hunt weaves an incredibly fascinating story around the habits and behavior of gorillas. The information alone on these remarkable primates is worth the read. Hunt, as always, shines brightly as she depicts her characters' flaws, fears and foibles with characteristic honesty. Readers will begin asking their own questions about the extent of animals' understanding and perceptions after journeying alongside this enthusiastic zookeeper named Glee. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-23

While this could be the premise for the latest teen gross-out flick to hit your local megaplex, it is, instead, a thoughtful postcard from America's West, signed by Donald Miller. <br /> <br />Miller landed firmly on the Christian publishing radar with his popular book BLUE LIKE JAZZ: Nonreligious Thoughts about Christian Spirituality. This edgy memoir about faith and subsequent releases offering a similar orthodox-yet-not take on questions about the Christian life solidified his position as what Marcia Ford called \\"Captain Trendy Spiritual Writer\\" in her review of BLUE LIKE JAZZ for Faithful Reader. <br /> <br />But BLUE wasn't Miller's first foray into book publishing. An earlier book, PRAYER AND ART OF VOLKSWAGEN MAINTENANCE, went relatively unnoticed; it's been revamped and republished as THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS to capitalized on Captain Trendy's popularity. That might not sound like a formula for compelling reading, but this is a case when marketing strategy benefits the general public. This is a book that deserves a second look. <br /> <br />In the interest of full disclosure, my idea of a perfect vacation is a road trip. If I can roll down the windows and turn up the music, I'm as happy as a clam (assuming of course, clams are happy creatures). Like the author, I hail from Texas and I recognized much of the terrain and even some of the people he describes in early chapters as the duo heads from Houston towards Oregon by way of the Grand Canyon. While I prefer traveling in vehicles that don't frequently require surgery on the side of road, I'm a sucker for the \\"two guys finding themselves and God on the open road\\" set-up. <br /> <br />Having said that, Miller delivers on the potential the premise holds. He manages to take beautiful snapshots of the landscape he's traveling through and the people he meets along the way without succumbing to sentimentalism. And while this journey is largely about knowing God better, THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS doesn't knock you over the head with a new bit of spiritual insight every few pages. Instead, overt spiritual musings are replaced with seemingly mundane details and observations that end up serving much the same function. <br /> <br />The humor in THROUGH PAINTED DESERTS is as dry as the high desert air Miller and Paul breathe on their way north. Their ongoing banter covers everything from how to survive a snake bite to what each is looking for in a girlfriend to musings about God; much of it is just begging for a Mark Mothersbaugh score to fade in. I laughed a lot. <br /> <br />By the time the duo makes it to Oregon, their friendship has matured and both guys have learned a lot about themselves and, perhaps, God. Basking in the beauty of the Northwest Miller writes, \\"It is a wonder that those exposed to such beauty forfeit the great questions in the face of such miraculous evidence. I think again about this small period of grace, and thank God for it, that if only for a season, I could feel the why of life, see it in the metaphor of light, in the endlessness of the cosmos, in the miracle of friendship. And if these mountains had the ability to reason, perhaps they would contemplate the beauty of humanity, and praise God for the miracle that each of us is, pondering the majesty of God and the wonder of man in one bewildering context.\\" <br /> <br />It's enough to make me consider taking a VW van on my next road trip. <br /> <br />(Okay, probably not.

You'll acquire the needed context for the characters and an appreciation for just how much has changed in the little town of Harmony --- and how much remains the same. <br /> <br />Already up to speed? For those of you fans who have followed the series, this one opens with Pastor Sam Gardner celebrating five years at Harmony Friends Meeting, which is \\"about four years and eleven months longer than he'd predicted when he became their pastor.\\" Sam prefers funerals to weddings --- \\"the guest of honor lay quietly, without a word of protest or advice, not worrying for one moment whether he'd forget the vows or she'd trip on her bridal gown.\\" As always, he has his hands full with his quirky congregation. If you're a small-town churchgoer, you'll quickly recognize the personalities in the Harmony Friends meeting --- only the names will be different. <br /> <br />There are some small-town sorts of changes in the air. Dale Hinshaw, the curmudgeonly church member and thorn in the flesh for Sam, is threatening to leave the Quakers for the Baptists. Deena Morrison is getting ready to walk down the aisle with a handsome doctor, and Harmony has its first traffic light.  <br /> <br />But the more things change in a small town, the more other things stay the same. Bob Miles, editor of the Harmony Herald, still pens his column, the \\"Bobservation Post,\\" and dishes out all the local gossip --- true and untrue. Former Indiana Sausage Queen Nora Nagle continues working the checkout counter of Kivett's Five & Dime, waiting for the right man to come along. Sam's idea of an exotic date with his wife Barbara hasn't improved much --- this time it's sneaking over to the Holidome in Cartersburg to swim at the pool, eat bologna sandwiches and HoHos, and share a coke from the vending machine. <br /> <br />It's a laid-back, mellow read. There are a few bumps on the journey but no real controversies or upsets. In some previous novels, Gulley hasn't been afraid to open a few cans of worms (homosexuality and the church, doubt and the clergyman), but in this one there's not much readers could raise an eyebrow over, theology-wise. The major crisis in this novel revolves around Ellis and Miriam Hodge's adopted 16-year-old daughter, Amanda, and Ellis's ne'er-do-well brother, Ralph, and his wife. Ralph had \\"sold\\" Amanda to her uncle and aunt while addicted to the bottle, but now he's back, fresh from Alcoholics Anonymous and wanting to start a new life as a family. However, the tension never escalates much past a gentle concern. Gulley writes with plenty of points of view that switch back and forth throughout the book, but the transitions are as slick as an automatic transmission. <br /> <br />I've known Phil Gulley for years (in the interests of full disclosure, he used to date my sister, so I consider him \\"almost\\" family) and I grew up just a few miles from Danville, his hometown. When I read Gulley's novels, I recognize many of the places he's drawn from. In the tradition of all great storytellers (he's often compared to Garrison Keillor and Jan Karon), Gulley has a knack for drawing from true life and embroidering it to make excellent fiction (there's not much in Cartersburg except a fire station, for example). The ring of authenticity in his novels comes from his knowledge of Indiana small towns and the characters who populate them. If you visit Danville, Indiana --- Gulley's hometown --- you'll even be able to visit the walk-up Dairy Queen, the site of the \\"sprinkles shortage\\" that made headlines in his May 4,2005 Harmony Herald newsletter (sign up for this monthly e-newsletter at [...]) or see for yourself the town square and coffee shop that provides setting material for the novel. <br /> <br />But you don't need to go to Danville to recognize the setting or the characters. Anyone familiar with small-town Midwestern life and churches will feel an instant comfortable recognition with Harmony and Harmony Friends Meeting. A happy ending will leave Gulley fans satisfied and looking forward to the next installment. <br /> <br />Enjoy the ride! <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-08-11

At only twenty-two, Nicky felt stunned and confused by the myriad of emotions he experienced when the word came that his mother, who once called Nicky a \\"child of the devil,\\" was near death in his home country of Puerto Rico. <br /> <br />Cruz recalls his tainted early childhood as the son of a man who was a spiritist and a mother who was a medium. His memories of bizarre sances, inexplicable physical occurrences, and otherworldly happenings all figured into Cruz's reluctance to re-enter his parents' demonically driven home. As a Christian, Cruz felt repulsed by his family's occultist practices, yet his passion for Jesus, his mercy toward the lost, and his visionary heart compelled him to revisit the last place on earth he would willingly choose. <br /> <br />Go he did, and God met Cruz's faithful obedience with an outpouring of support from surrounding churches that encircled Cruz's home and prayed for his mother's deliverance from demonic influences. Cruz credits God for releasing his mother from the grips of satanic power, and miraculously she didn't die but lived another twenty-five years after having committed her life to Christ. <br /> <br />Cruz's own scurrilous past makes him the ideal communicator to those lost in the grip of poverty, drugs, alcohol, sexual addictions, and crime. And communicate he does --- daily, hourly. Cruz's own rescue from a life of violence came at age nineteen, and sadly he recounts how slimly he escaped from the all-too-frequent sting of prejudice and discrimination from within the church itself. Citing the need for believers to embrace a lifestyle characterized by passionate love for all people, Cruz tells how after having received an invitation from the pastor ofa local New York church, he was rudely accosted by an elderly horror of a woman who blatantly criticized Cruz and his fellow gang members' appearances and instructed them to leave. Even today, Cruz is incredulous at the woman's arrogance, as he admits how even one week previous to this encounter, his gang would have killed her, no question about it. Thankfully, something within Cruz realized that this woman wasn't representative of all Christians. Yet this experience sobered Cruz, and he continues to speak out in support of those who are not the lovely, the gifted, or the favored. <br /> <br />Throughout this three-part text based upon developing personal passion, mercy and vision, Cruz challenges Christians to get involved in their community and their world by developing a dependence upon God and his power. He speaks with sincerity, humility, and bold intensity as he cites numerous times and places across the globe where God has turned tragedy into triumph. Nicky Cruz's ministry and message will draw a wide range of enthusiastic readers, and even those from the more conservative evangelical camp will applaud his ongoing and ever-increasing zeal for reaching the world with Christ's message of redemption. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-04

An experienced scuba diver, Trent went out for a free dive on September 10th. He never returned. <br /> <br />On September 11th, as a search and rescue effort was underway, Tammy watched on TV as planes plowed into the World Trade Center and later that night she identified her husband's body. It surely felt like the world was coming to an end. \\"When I first lost my husband, it seemed impossible to even breathe. Shock, then sadness, and sometimes fear, literally took my breath away,\\" she writes in BEYOND THE SORROW. <br /> <br />In the book, Tammy shares her own story, relaying the lessons she's learned and encouragement she's received. Such books, especially those packaged like this one and obviously intended to be given to friends and family experiencing grief, can easily devolve into a regurgitation of platitudes. But this is not the case here. Tammy is honest about the lack of easy answers and vulnerable with her pain throughout. The result is part confessional, part \\"how-to\\" (survive losing someone you love), part motivational speech, part theological lesson. BEYOND THE SORROW is a deceptively small book for the large emotional punch it delivers. <br /> <br />Four years after losing her husband, Tammy's pain is still close to the surface. \\"As a young married couple, we thought we'd have a long lifetime to grow old together. We had just begun to talk about starting a family when he was taken from me. If you could see me sitting here, you'd see a woman who's still very broken. I must admit, there are still days when all I want to do is close the window shades and curl up on the couch praying that I'll wake up from this unbelievable dream that my life has become.\\" <br /> <br />Such honesty makes it easier to believe her claims of healing and heed her advice about what moving forward really lookslike. \\"One of the most important changes you can make in life is to keep living, no matter what circumstances surround you. It is never hopeless when you know the Lord, when you know who God really is --- not some figure up on a throne, but someone who loves you and wants to have a personal relationship with you. Knowing we are not alone and that we will be comforted is what helps us make it through. God is still good when life is hard. And His invitation to chose life is always there for us.\\" <br /> <br />Tammy is a speaker with the Women of Faith conferences and a Christian recording artist. As such she weaves in the support and wisdom she's received from some of her fellow speakers and Christian personalities, like Luci Swindoll, Pam Thum and Lisa Beville. But she also includes notes and anecdotes from unfamiliar names, and most importantly, she always points people back to God. <br /> <br />\\"God had been a part of my life since I was a child, but sometimes it seemed like I was praying to someone who lives on a big throne in heaven, not sitting next to me on my couch,\\" she writes. \\"But his presence has become so real to me since I lost Trent. I had to just depend on Him in a close, personal way. And He has met me there. He has kept his promises to give me strength to carry on through the dark days, comfort me with his love, and lead me back home.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-04

Here, veteran relationship team Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott show how difficult problems can lead to deeper, more committed marriages in I LOVE YOU MORE (a re-issue of the earlier WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD MARRIAGES, 2001). While much of their advice will have a familiar ring to those who regularly read marriage self-help books, the idea of using negative marital circumstances to achieve a positive outcome makes this book stand out from the ordinary.    The Parrotts are perhaps best known for their Soul Mates Seminars and long-running output of books on marriage for Christian audiences. They speak with the experience of interactions with many married couples when they write, \\"No marriage --- no matter how good --- is immune to everyday problems.\\" The very problems that seem to threaten marital happiness, they believe, are actually the \\"tipping point\\" for deeper love between a husband and wife. Sound counter-intuitive? Read on....    Contrary to romantic belief, love is not enough to make a happy marriage. Neither is shared faith. (Oklahoma, they point out, the buckle of the Bible belt, has one of the highest divorce rates in the United States). Don't get them wrong --- love and faith are important. But a good marriage is built by two people's capacity to adjust to negative things. The bankruptcy you didn't expect. The child who is born disabled. The affair you thought you'd never have. The depression that incapacitates your spouse. \\"We have staked everything on this person we marry,\\" they write. \\"...And we eventually learn this person is not what we expected, or at least what we wished.\\"    The Parrotts like to break things down into manageable bites of information. They list five possibilities that contribute to marital problems, including idealistic couples with unfulfilled expectations, restless couples who have not examined, contented couples who have not tappedinto their unskilled potential, couples who make unhealthy choices, and unpredictable circumstances.    Much of marriage is about attitude, the authors caution, adding that a good attitude is your most important marital asset. \\"Good attitudes open the double doors of marriage for optimism to do its work... without optimism, couples see no way out of their negative circumstances,\\" they write. They offer four steps to turn around a bad attitude: look for the positive, refuse to be a victim, give up your grudges, and give yourself and your marriage some grace. A sure sign of a good marital attitude is when you are not only willing to go the first mile, but also go the extra mile in your marriage, the \\"extra-mile principle.\\"    The Parrotts also list \\"six subtle saboteurs\\" that can deep-six a marriage: busyness, irritation, boredom, drift, debt, and pain from the past. Practically, the Parrotts offer readers the five \\"most important\\" tools a marriage needs to successfully battle everyday problems. Who could resist? Not this reader. The five (not so easy) steps they recommend are: Ownership --- taking responsibility for the good as well as the bad; Hope --- believing that good wins over bad; Empathy --- walking in your partner's shoes; Forgiveness --- healing the hurts you don't deserve; and Commitment --- living the love you promised. They conclude the book with an overview of learning to speak your spouse's spiritual language, partially drawn from Gary Thomas's must-read book, SACRED PATHWAYS. The Parrotts believe that marriage is a spiritual discipline. \\"A stronger marriage is a side effect of learning to love God --- together.\\"    One thing to be aware of: If you buy this book, the publisher has ensured you'll want to purchase at least one of the accompanying husband or wife workbooks by directing readers to do exercises from it throughout the text. In some ways, this feels a little like a marketing gimmick to sell more books. However, there are questions for reflection included at the end of each chapter, so the book will stand on its own without the additional workbooks.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

In his latest title, GOD'S MIRROR: A Modern Parable, he tells two stories that reflect on what it means to be God's ambassadors in the world. One of those stories is that of G.R. Tweed, a young navel officer who spent three years hiding on the island of Guam during World War II. <br /> <br />\\"When the Japanese occupied the island in 1941, he ducked into the thick tropical brush. Survival hadn't been easy, but he preferred the swamp to a POW camp. Late in the day July 10, 1944, he spotted the friendly vessel. He scurried up a hill and positioned himself on a cliff. Reaching into his pack, he pulled out a small mirror. At 6:20 p.m., he began sending signals. Holding the edge of the mirror in his fingers, he tilted it back and forth, bouncing the sunrays in the direction of the boat. Three short flashes. Three long. Three short again. Dot-dot-dot. Dash-dash-dash. Dot-dot-dot. SOS. <br /> <br />The signal caught the eyes of a sailor on board the USS McCall. A rescue party boarded a motorized dinghy and slipped into the cove past the coastal guns. Tweed was rescued.\\" <br /> <br />It was a good thing Tweed had that mirror and knew how to use it. But Lucado goes on to entertain a crazy idea: what if the mirror hadn't cooperated? \\"Suppose the mirror had resisted, pushed its own agenda. Rather than reflect a message from the sun, suppose it had opted to send its own.\\" <br /> <br />After all, says Lucado, after three years of isolation the mirror might have been starved for attention. What if, instead of sending an SOS, it sent a LAM (Look At Me!) signal? What if, after three years of inactivity, the mirror was insecure about its abilities? \\"What if I blow it? What if I send a dash when I'm supposed to send a dot? ... Self-doubt could paralyze a mirror.\\" <br /> <br />So could self-pity. \\"Been crammed down in that pack, lugged through jungles, and now, all of a sudden expected to face the bright sun and perform a crucial service? No way. Staying in the pack. Not getting any reflection out of me.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, it's a good thing that mirror didn't have a mind of its own. But Lucado points out that we, God's mirrors, do have minds of our own. After a short Greek lesson parsing out 2 Corinthians 3:7, he goes on to unpack the idea of what it means to be a mirror and issues a challenge: \\"Dare we hope to be a mirror in the hand of God, the reflection of the light of God? This is the call.\\" <br /> <br />GOD'S MIRROR is more a series of thoughtful questions than an in-depth teaching about the Christian life, though it's certainly instructive at a basic level. As such, it's a gift book that would be well-suited for friends and family members just starting to grapple with what it means to be God's ambassadors in the world. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-04

The Little Brothers model their days on what they call the \\"hidden life\\" of Jesus, the many years he spent in obscurity devoted to manual labor and prayer before launching his public ministry. Manning spent his time shoveling manure, washing dishes, and mediating on Scriptures, among other things <br /> <br />The formative experience taught Manning that it's true transparency that we Christians must achieve in order to be a community of people who will live under the sway of the Spirit, \\"men and women who would be human torches aglow with the fire of love for Christ, prophets and lovers ignited with the flaming Spirit of the living God.\\" But such transparency is foolish in the eyes of the world, as it involves reorienting our lives around the Gospel and ignoring the siren calls of pleasure, power, and security. <br /> <br />His latest book (a revision of one of his earliest books), THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING FOOLISH, is a primer in just such foolishness, and in classic Manning form it doesn't pull any punches. It's prophecy in three parts: The Way We Live, The Mind of Christ, and The Power of the Cross. Throughout he preaches against superficial forms of the faith and rallies believers around Christ's love. He weaves together scripture and stories of the many people he's rubbed shoulders with throughout his life to great effect: <br /> <br />\\"I have often seen Jesus Christ's delight over repentant sinners brought to life in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. The birthday celebrations marking the anniversary of an alcoholic's first, third, eighth, or twentieth year of sobriety resound with the merriment of the prodigal's return. <br /> <br />An old broken man name Phil with three teeth in his mouth lived as a drunk on the streets for twenty years. Now he walks to the podium in a packed and quiet room. It's his first birthday. Nobody thoughthe'd make it. He starts to speak about once being lost and now being found. He suddenly chokes up and turns his back to the audience. A standing ovation starts. Men and women storm the podium. They kiss Phil on the lips, cheek, neck, and shoulders. <br /> <br />Christ's compassion is illuminated with astonishing clarity at the dinner given in the house of Simon the leper (Mark 14:3-9). Some of the guests become infuriated when a woman breaks an alabaster jar of precious perfume and begins pouring it over Jesus's head. 'Leave her alone,' Jesus commands. 'Why are you bothering her?' He is so deeply moved by the women's kindness that he wants it recounted and retold all over the world. 'Write this down!' he tells them. 'Until the end of time I want you to know how deeply this woman's love has affected me.' <br /> <br />This statement is the long pent-up explosion of a love that can express itself at last, the secret of a heart pouring itself out. Jesus not only defends the woman's action but affirms her worth and acknowledges that he has been profoundly moved by her kindness. When we see the Master Forgive the prostitute and nullify all her sins because of her great love (Luke 7:47), we glimpse God's joy in finding us again; we discover that this joy is capable of submerging all the evil we can commit. We can finally stop wondering about the past, the extent of our guilt, and limits of God's love and mercy.\\" <br /> <br />Those who are familiar with Manning's classic work THE RAGAMUFFIN GOSPEL will find themselves treading some familiar ground here. In the updating and revision process, some stories from that well-known (and well-loved) treatise on grace have been worked into this book. But the deja vu is quickly surmounted by Manning's clear-eyed, earnest plea for Christians to give themselves over entirely to Christ's love and all of its ramifications for their lives. Don't read this book if you don't want to be challenged. <br /> <br />\\"The Little Brothers learn to disentangle essentials from nonessentials and to realize that this particular way of life is simply an exterior consequence of an immense, passionate, and uncompromising love for the person of Jesus,\\" he writes. \\"To live among the poorest and most abandoned of peoples as a manual laborer without clerical garb, to pass days and weeks in the desert in the gratuitous praise of God, to communicate through friendship values that cannot be communicated through preaching, satisfies not a desire for novelty but a compulsion of love. Some may call it foolish. I call it true wisdom from the God of Love.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-04

Not the kind of winner who twists off a bottle cap to discover they just won a free iTunes download, but the kind of person whose life demonstrates a remarkable sense of spiritual victory. <br /> <br />In LOSERS AND WINNERS, SAINTS AND SINNERS, pastor Greg Laurie asks some rather deep questions about what it means to live a truly successful life. <br /> <br />What are the secrets to spiritual longevity? <br /> <br />How can you ensure you will cross the finish line? <br /> <br />How can you know if you will hear the Lord say, \\"Well done, good and faithful servant\\"? <br /> <br />Laurie writes, \\"We should all be asking these questions because one day every one of us will complete this race we are running. And each of us will be either a winner or a loser. One day, we all are going to die.\\" <br /> <br />To answer such deep, life-reflective questions, Laurie examines the lives of key figures from the Bible. In many ways, this book reads more like a series of sermons --- often complete with two, three, and four point messages --- than a typical nonfiction book, but the project is organized well enough to pull off the sometimes bumpy transitions between chapters. <br /> <br />One of the title's greatest strengths is its focus on Biblical characters. Laurie takes a look at the life of King Saul and Samson, people who started well in their spiritual race only to stumble and never fully recover. It follows the lives of such men as David, Elijah and Elisha to demonstrate that just because you fall doesn't mean you have to stay down. And it takes a look at Joseph as one who stayed strong throughout his life journey <br /> <br />The story of Paul demonstrates that even the most unlikely of candidates can make a significant change in their spiritual life, while the life of Peter teaches us that even our blunders are not above redemption. Meanwhile, Moses teaches us that it's never too late for God to do something miraculous. Stories of Caleb, Enoch and Ananias also fill the text. <br /> <br />As Laurie follows each character's journey, he adds in anecdotes, stories and quotes from a variety of modern day and historical believers to tie the text together. The result is an enjoyable read. One of the strengths of highlighting the lives of so many Biblical people is that the book at times works as a kind of overview of the Bible --- making scriptural principles accessible through memorable stories. <br /> <br />If the title of the book seems familiar, it's because it's taken from the popular worship song, \\"And We All Bow Down\\" by Lenny LeBlanc and recorded by Integrity's Hosanna! Music. It's a nice tie-in and reminder of the worship tune, even if you don't \\"win\\" a free download the next time you buy a soda that's having a sweepstakes. <br /> <br />Whether you're starting out in life or looking to finish strong, LOSERS AND WINNERS, SAINTS AND SINNERS is a helpful, biblically-based book worth reading.

Donna Partow, the funny, self-condescending speaker/author whose humorous self-deprecating style is similar to that of fellow Christian comedian Chonda Pierce, writes with honesty and disarming charm about her tendency to star as the drama queen in her own life. SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE is Partow's calling card as she details how in the not-too-distant past she used to think that her problems were driving her crazy and then realized it was her craziness that was creating the problems. She cites her three favorites pastimes as \\"Thinking how awful my life was. Telling everyone who got within a mile of me how awful my life had been and wondering why I didn't have any friends.\\" <br /> <br />Eventually, Partow came to realize how vital a proper perspective is to a healthy life. Says Partow, \\"Our best hope for a brighter future is in learning how to turn our melodramas into 'mellow dramas.'\\" It is on this premise that Partow speaks with personal conviction as she endeavors to steer other self-proclaimed dramatists to a biblical and more balanced mindset. <br /> <br />Partow discusses a diverse selection of topics in this twelve-chapter text. Female readers will identify with this author's take on marriage issues, financial challenges, disappointments with church (and its members), emotional struggles, the frustrations of parenting, derailed dreams, and lingering childhood issues. Each chapter combines the practical with the poignant, and Partow also includes some thoughtful end-of-book questions so that readers can take the next step in introspectively dealing with these life issues, either singly or in a group setting. <br /> <br />One of the opening chapters deals with what the author says is a common problem amongst churchgoers. It is titled, \\"The Porcupine State of Mind.\\" This prickly personality is typecast as one suffering from a persistent, know-it-all, fix-it attitude. Partow defines this theoretical person as one who has lots of good points though no onewants to be around her. A porcupine woman knows she is right --- she can straighten out the people in her life, her workplace, her church, her world. To determine if one is a porcupine individual, Partow purports that said individuals frequently deliver silent sermons to everyone, from the store clerk to their pastor. Other key indictors include thinking you are the best neighbor, yet the neighbors never invite you over, or perhaps you single-handedly run your place of business but repeatedly get passed over for a promotion. Even though you've devoted your life to your children, they never come around anymore. <br /> <br />Partow then shares ample biblical principles for overcoming such an abrasive mindset by focusing on responding positively and with biblical love in all situations. Not an easy change of pace, yet essential for a healthy, balanced lifestyle. <br /> <br />Throughout the text, Partow reveals her struggles sincerely and with frank transparency. It is this trait that will further endear her to Christians who struggle to gain and maintain an overall balanced mindset. This resource is best digested slowly and with a leaning toward addressing the inside so as to affect an outward biblical reflection. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-04

Lewis and Joy Davidman	Books	3	28	28	N	N	An absorbing introduction to Lewis and Davidman's life together	Of the making and reading of books about C.S. Lewis there seemingly is no end. But readers new to Lewis's life will likely appreciate this re-release, retitling, and re-jacketing of THROUGH THE SHADOWLANDS: The Love Story of C.S. Lewis and Joy Davidman.<br /><br />However, reader be warned: the subtitle is a bit misleading. Aside from a brief introduction set after Joy's funeral, the story of their relationship doesn't begin until page 77. Those who have read biographies of C.S. Lewis may wish to skip to this point, since Brian Sibley spends the early pages telling the story of Lewis's childhood, his time as a professor at Oxford and with the Inklings, and his publications. Although it's a good recap of Lewis's life, some of the observations are vague, such as allusions to sexual encounters Lewis had in his youth (mentioned without any further explanation) or the mysterious relationship Lewis developed with a Mrs. Moore and her daughter. Readers likely will want to consult other Lewis biographies and commentaries for more in-depth information.<br /><br />Once Sibley gets down to the business of the relationship between Lewis and Helen Joy Davidman, things begin to pick up. Davidman, a Jewish convert to Christianity and a divorcee with two young sons, David and Douglas, is a complicated, fascinating person as viewed through Sibley's eyes. Compellingly, he sketches out her childhood years with an authoritarian father who alternately demanded his children respond to commands given on a whistle and then repeatedly slapped them about the face when they disobeyed. Joy was, as Sibley describes her, chubby, nearsighted, and overprotected by her mother. She loved animals, and became increasingly rebellious at home under the domineering influence of her father.<br /><br />Her solace was books, and Davidman later became a poet, novelist and teacher --- and interestingly enough, a member of the Communist party. Delight in George MacDonald books such as PHANTASTES and THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND led her to the fantasy novels of Lewis, which would eventually, Sibley explains, point her toward religion and, of course, a marriage to Lewis.<br /><br />Sibley chronicles in detail Davidman's difficult marriage to the alcoholic philanderer and novelist Bill Gresham and her own maturation as a mother and a writer. It's with this background that he begins the description of her correspondence with Lewis, starting in 1950, their subsequent meetings and relationship, through her diagnosis with cancer and eventual death.<br /><br />Adeptly, Sibley shows how Lewis is left with his previous writings on pain, suffering, and faith, and the inadequacies of his own words in the face of his grief. \\"Many of Jack's admirers would have been deeply shocked if they had known that he had even entertained such doubts, or admitted such fears,\\" writes Sibley. Lewis's doubts and sorrow eventually led to A GRIEF OBSERVED, one of his bestselling books. Sibley's account of the couple's time together, Lewis's response to Davidman's death, and his own acceptance of his illness and approaching demise make the last hundred pages of THROUGH THE SHADOWLANDS an absorbing read.<br /><br />Sibley does an excellent job smoothly transitioning between excerpted materials and quotes, and his own narrative. However, one of the most serious faults of the books is its lack of crediting specific source material. Although the acknowledgments list the publications Sibley draws from, individual excerpts and quotes are not footnoted or endnoted. For anyone who is already a devotee of all things Lewis, this oversight means they cannot go off on the delightful tangents of extended reading inspired by specific citations. Since this book was originally released in 1985 as C.S. LEWIS: THROUGH THE SHADOWLANDS, it's disappointing that subsequent reprintings haven't included some revision to address this shortcoming.<br /><br />This might be best read by readers who are newcomers to the life of C.S.Lewis and who desire an overview of his life and marriage, rather than by those already familiar with the numerous books about Lewis's life. With Lewis's THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE making another transition to the big screen in 2005, this will serve as a good introduction to Lewis and Davidman's life together.<br /><br /> (...)	2005-08-04

As the young associate pastor of Pleasant Valley Baptist Church in Houston, Texas with a megachurch congregation, Mark is the designated successor. The senior pastor, James Montclair, glows with praise when he talks with Mark. Yet in the early pages of the book, Mark meets Amanda Thompson and falls in love. The couple has a lot of passion in their relationship, and Amanda learns she is pregnant. As a Christian in ministry, Mark knows he's thrown a bit and they need to get married --- but he has no idea how much.    As James said to his associate, \\"It's not what I expected of you. At all.\\" The anger rose in degrees.    Mark took it like a tackle, impassive.    \\"I'll have to talk to the board,\\" James flipped open his calendar.    \\"Would you?\\" Hope descended like the dove in the painting, breaking through the clouds of gray with specks of holy light. Mark spoke in a rush. \\"I'll go before them, tell them what happened, and that we're getting married. Before the church if I have to, like a testimony, tell them how even people in leadership, in the church, can make mistakes and that we're not perfect, just forgiven-\\"    \\"Mark,\\" James said, gentle and sad, \\"It's over.\\"    \\"Over?\\" The specks disappeared, the shadows covered the flight, as if it never happened. Turning what had been hope to an overwhelming gray.    \\"We have to let you go. Surely you can see that. Being on staff here --- doing what you've been doing --- we can't keep you on.\\"    Mark comes face to face with the stark reality about some of the unspoken rules of the modern-day church. The senior pastor may talk about forgiveness from the pulpit. Yet how is this forgiveness practically administered when someone on the church staff falls into sexual sin --- even if they are going to get married? Mark is forced to immediately resign.    After the sudden loss of his job, Mark considers a career change and staying in Houston, which would be near both of their families. Yet this choice doesn't match Mark's training and long-term life plans.    When James Montclair gives Mark a lead on a possible job in the Texas Panhandle, he follows the opportunity. A former football coach turned pastor, Ervin Plumley needs an associate pastor at Lakeview Community Church in Potter Springs, Texas. Plumley offers Mark the job, so the young couple moves away from their families to make a new life and serve this small congregation. Through many twists and turns, they learn to deal with failure and find their place of service in the world.    Ultimately the amount of life changes becomes overwhelming for Amanda. She takes matters into her own hands and flees to Mexico in search of her own identity and soul. Mark chases after her and together they learn valuable lessons about the reality of faith in life.    For a first novel, Britta Coleman writes with gritty realism and characters facing true drama. For example, Mark faces his feelings of the sexual temptation from Courtney Williams, the attractive and active single member of his congregation. And Amanda struggles to find her place in the church community --- even if she doesn't have much of a faith relationship. Readers will appreciate how Coleman weaves a world with rich characterization and a page-turning plot. They will pull for the couple and tug on their own heartstrings as they turn pages and see how Mark and Amanda handle the challenges of life.    As a long-time reader of fiction, I was impressed with the fresh storytelling and vivid words from this new novelist. I recommend this novel and will be watching for Britta Coleman's next work. The lessons from the lives of Coleman's characters will provide some moving insight about what it means to follow Jesus in today's world.       --- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin (...).	2005-08-04

To Emily's ecstasy, she gets hired, finds an apartment to share, and is raring to go \\"change the world.\\" Little does she realize how great an impact this new world will have on her. <br /> <br />The innocent, worldly, guileless Emily must do her best to get past those emotionally horrendous transitional moments with her bizarre roommate Brittany, who alternates charging Emily the odd penny every other month on expenses; Xavier, Emily's editor boss who dresses in Darth Vader garb and licks peanut butter from the jar with his finger sans spoon; and the other associate editors --- Regina, Lane and Skylar --- with whom Emily has virtually nothing in common except their place of employment. <br /> <br />As Emily finds her feet in the working world of publishing, she begins to relax. Eating out daily is the only feasible practice for a working gal like her, so she is told. Sadly, going out nightly to bars and drinking, sometimes heavily, is also another \\"expectation\\" glibly tossed Emily's way through her only friends, her fellow editorial assistants. Desperate to fit in, and realizing her lifelong dream of making a successful transition in the big city, Emily finds herself compromising her Christian faith, in small, seemingly insignificant ways: drinking too much or too often, buying into a have-to-have-it materialistic mentality, getting a little too physical with her new boyfriend, and learning to play political games on the job. All these \\"little\\" choices begin to eat away at Emily's once confident, kindly trusting nature. <br /> <br />Over time, it's the subtle love and support from her uncle, also a Christian, and an email friend who Emily knew in grammar school that challenge her to think beyond the \\"expected,\\" and eventually Emily starts taking sensible proactive steps that define her and her faith. She learns to face up to difficult truths, to take ethical stands, and to confront her own inner fears of being rejected for who she is. <br /> <br />By the book's end, readers will have journeyed with Emily and enjoyed the trip. Peppered with gentle humor and edgy dialogue, the authors excel at getting under the surface and to the heart of Emily's struggles, to all our insecurities. Readers will thoroughly enjoy walking alongside this young adult woman as she learns to accept herself in an unaccepting, unsupportive environment. Emily's takeaway is one worth revisiting whenever the temptation to cave in to another's expectations comes calling. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Michele Howe	2005-08-04

This missionary kid-turned-successful-businessman-turned-bestselling-author believes that many believers have been seduced into a kind of spiritual boredom, merely surviving rather than thriving in their faith journey. <br /> <br />He writes, \\"In reading the New Testament, we see the writers repeatedly expressing their insatiable longing for their own inheritance, the hope of glory. For the bliss that awaited them. But the groaning for the afterlife so often expressed by these early writers has become a moan of boredom in the church today. We are more interested in the pleasures of this life than the bliss of the next.\\" <br /> <br />Dekker suggests that nothing will truly satisfy us in this life unless it is \\"fully bathed in an obsession for eternity.\\" Because many Christians focused their efforts on finding pleasure and happiness in this life, they are missing out on the true joy that comes from keeping one eye on eternity. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book gets off to a lackluster start. Dekker begins by recounting his own painful childhood as the son of missionaries, describing in detail specific moments of heartache, loneliness, and feeling like a misfit. While his stories are vulnerable and honest, they read as if he's still bleeding as they're retold, and as a result a small amount of anger, much like a low-grade fever, quietly sweeps through some of the prose. <br /> <br />Yet Dekker is able to focus his anger, disappointment and frustration into a transformational message of hope concerning the life to come, and that's where SLUMBER comes alive. <br /> <br />While many books tend to lose their luster halfway through, Dekker manages to kick his book into fifth gear --- a sign of the writer's natural talent and ability that undoubtedly will continue todevelop in his next few nonfiction titles. The latter half of the book has an unmistakable passion as it seeks to wake Christians out of their sleepy state and into the God-reality that awaits them. The writing is quick, insightful and fast-paced as the author explores the meaning of hope, obsession, eternity and pleasure. <br /> <br />Dekker examines a bit of his own passion when he explores the theology of imagination. He argues that imagination is a \\"critical gift\\" for Christians. He goes on to use pieces of his own fiction to drive home simple but profound truths. Fans of Dekker's work will be excited to see him blend his talents for fiction and nonfiction to teach lessons, much like Jesus did in the Gospels. The book concludes with a practical question-and-answer chapter where Dekker addresses specific questions about his writing, theology and the message of the book. <br /> <br />Ted Dekker sets out to ignite a fresh passion for heaven on earth, and by the end of the book he clearly achieves his goal. If you're looking for an alarm clock for your personal faith journey, this book definitely is ticking. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Margaret Feinberg ([...]	2005-08-04

So after his dad died and Vaughn was cleaning out the garage, he was surprised at the depth of his grief. \\"The only thing I had left from my dad was an old tackle box and silence.\\" He continues, \\"I remember crying out to God, 'This is it? This is all I get? I don't even have my father's signature!' \\" <br /> <br />That garage moment set in motion Vaughn's growing nationwide movement to encourage men to write periodic letters to their children --- and wives and parents --- leaving a legacy of blessing, affirmation, and love.  <br /> <br />The book essentially explains how to set about writing letters, complete with sample letters, a table of contents listing topics that letters might address over time, and writing tips from a college professor. Vaughn suggests that letters include three elements: praise, hope and vision for the future, and assurance of loving commitment. <br /> <br />But it also has an unfolding plot with multiple characters, explaining how Vaughn gathered a dozen men to join him in his initial, tentative venture. They met monthly for four months, agreeing to write and then read to the group letters they'd written --- first to wives, then to children, then to parents, living or dead, and finally a letter on the order of a final testament: \\"If our friends who've passed away had been able to speak at their own funerals, I wonder what they would've said. Have you ever thought about that? What would you say if you could speak at your own funeral?\\" <br /> <br />You see the men interested in the letter-writing concept but clueless as to what to say or how to start. You see the reactions of wives and children when they receive their first letters, presented, according to Vaughn's schema, in wooden boxes with engraved nameplates. You see glimpses into Vaughn's own blended family. You see the birth of a church-based course called \\"Letters from Dad.\\" <br /> <br />On one level the book is a promotional piece for Vaughn's ministry, but it should not be discounted on that count. It is an inspiring and encouraging tool in its own right. Its breezy tone, airy design, and short (four-page) chapters make the venture accessible even to reluctant participants. It would make a great gift for any father but especially those looking for some tangible way to connect with their children and those who are facing their own mortality and need to feel that they will be remembered after their passing. <br /> <br />As for leaving markable legacies, every chapter of LETTERS FROM DAD begins with a page of feel-good, multigenerational family photos that create nostalgia and interest. But the people are never identified. It seems most --- but not all --- are Vaughn's own family. It makes one wonder: Who are those guys? <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-08-04

She started out as a singer and went on to become a frequent television personality with her stints on the \\"700 Club\\" and her own \\"Heart to Heart with Shelia Walsh\\" on the Family Channel. More recently she's been touring the nation speaking at Women of Faith conferences, and in between it all she's managed to write almost 20 books for adults and children. Her latest foray into writing is COME AS YOU ARE: An Open Invitation from the Heart of God. And in it she tells this story. <br /> <br />Several years ago, Shelia was getting ready to speak before a large group of women. She was wearing a new white suit, looking polished. But as she waited backstage, with five minutes to go before show time, her then three-year-old son ran towards her with arms outstretched for a hug yelling \\"I love you, Mommy!\\" He was covered in chocolate, and in that moment she had a decision to make. <br /> <br />\\"I saw the chocolate-encrusted face and sticky hands approaching, but I saw something else, something far more compelling. I saw the look in his eyes. I saw the love and trust that a child has for a parent. I saw the twinkle and joy that Christian and I share in our relationship. I saw the abandon he has when he throws himself at his dad or mom. I knelt down and opened my arms and scooped him up in a big hug. When I released him and put him down again I had little chocolate deposits on the shoulders of my suit and a big chocolate kiss on my cheek. I smiled down at my brown-eyed son and headed for the stage, my friend Marilyn Meberg wiping my cheek as we walked.... <br /> <br />\\"I know that it would be perfectly acceptable to divert an oncoming food disaster, but I made a commitment to Christian before he was born that speaks to moments like these. <br /> <br />\\"I want to be part of God's show-and-tell to my son. I want him to know deep in his heart that he can come to me at any time with anything and I will receive him. At three he comes with chocolate on his face, but at fifteen he might come with a darker stain on his soul.\\" <br /> <br />It's true; as we grow older, our problems get darker and more complex (at least it sure seems that way). We're all stained in some way --- fear, disappointment, brokenness, shame, unfulfilled longing, anger. And in her book, Shelia touches on each of these areas with a lilting, melodic literary voice that weaves together personal stories with poetry and Scripture. <br /> <br />COME AS YOU ARE is certainly encouragement lite, but it stays a few steps away from being sappy. Instead, it strikes a delicate tone for women who might be teetering on the edge of willingness to delve into their own. <br /> <br />Shelia has the same message for her readers that she had for her son --- whatever dark stains you might have, come to your Father anyway. God will receive you with open arms, sticky fingers and all. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-03

Author F. P. Lione is actually a married couple --- Frank and Pam Lione. Both are Italian American children of NYPD detectives, and Frank is a veteran of the New York Police Department, which causes the story to resonate with authenticity.<br /><br />In his tenth year as a cop, Tony Cavalucci works New York City's 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue, known by old-timers as \\"the deuce.\\" He's 32, single, out of shape (the amount of food and beverages detailed in this story that he consumes is staggering), and drifting dangerously toward depression. His girlfriend has just run off with her boss, and his partner is out of commission with a knee injury.<br /><br />Booze helps Cavalucci deal with it all. Lots of booze.<br /><br />Cavalucci is paired with Joe Fiore, a bona-fide Christian who has a good reputation among the cops, but isn't Cavalucci's preferred choice. As their partnership unfolds, readers glimpse the often mundane and sometimes fascinating and unexpected happenings of police work. There are the burglar alarms that must be checked --- but might be a set-up for a later robbery. The delicate political maneuverings when a state legislator is robbed after cruising for trouble in a questionable part of the city. The embarrassment when a cop upchucks over a \\"perp.\\" Some \\"ick\\" moments occur, such as when a drug dealer intentionally defecates in the police car, so this is not a novel you'll want to read over lunch.<br /><br />Alongside the police scenes, the Liones paint a compelling portrait of Cavalucci's volatile dysfunctional Italian family, torn apart by divorce. The Christian themes are handled well for readers of faith --- the Christianity is not too preachy, or alternately, not too lightweight. Cavalucci's journey from alcoholic to sober cop is believable and intriguing. Despite the heaviness of several of the themes, there is plenty of genuine humor (Fiore: \\"Is it hard not to drink at family gatherings?\\" Cavalucci: \\"It's hard not to drink before family gatherings!\\") There are nice threads of romance woven throughout, and a redemptive ending that will please most readers.<br /><br />A few stumbling blocks occur, however, including a lot of police lingo that is inconsistently explained (EDP, turret lights, perp, collar, etc.). Readers may find themselves wishing for a glossary, such as the ones Dee Henderson incorporates in her \\"Uncommon Heroes\\" military series. The Liones also tend to over-detail the mechanics of a character's actions, which can slow the pacing down. Too many sentences begin consecutively with the same word or words (\\"We had a robbery ... We came up negative ... We had a robbery...) and many of their sentences are the same length, which can feel stilted and tire the reader. Sometimes, a scene is so rich in detail that the reader bogs down in the description (such as a scene involving a jewelry store).<br /><br />But these are the types of problems most first novelists wrestle with, and the Liones hopefully will correct them in their next offering. The insider knowledge of the dynamics of the NYPD that the Liones bring to their story is more than apt compensation for these flaws.

Dale Cramer. The title is clever --- a play on the name of Amish farmer Levi Mullet's son, Will; an allusion to Levi's stubbornness; and a nod toward the legacies that fathers leave their sons.    The protagonist of Cramer's novel is Will Mullet, a 19-year-old Amish teen who is in desperate trouble. His girlfriend of sorts is pregnant, and rather than tying the knot, he elects to run away from Apple Creek, Ohio, and enlist in the military (another no-no in his pacifist community). The story bounces back and forth between the 1980s and four decades before, as we listen to Will's musings as a 60-year-old, then follow his life leading up to that point.    The prose is often beautiful, as one would expect from Cramer's earlier books, SUTTER'S CROSS and BAD GROUND (named one of Publisher's Weekly and Library Journal's top books for 2004). However, rather than fleshing out one location, as he did so well in both earlier books, Cramer ambitiously attempts to follow Will across the globe, placing him in Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Belgium, and other places. For readers who appreciated Cramer's ability to develop a sense of \\"place,\\" this fragmentation --- along with the switching back and forth between time periods --- will feel a bit disappointing. (The community of Apple Creek would seem to lend itself to lots of introspection.) James Michener did a better job fleshing out the Amish community in CENTENNIAL, which included as one of its many subplots Pennsylvania Dutch boy Levi Zendt's abrupt departure from his Amish home for the settling of the West. Granted, however, Michener took 900 pages to do so.    What Cramer does with excellence is unfold relationships between generations and between friends, which ring with authenticity. When Will heads for Atlanta to find work with an old military friend, Jubal Barefoot, Cramer's writing lightly skims some of the strong themes of Bad Ground --- construction projects, the maturing of a man through difficult circumstances, and the forging of relationships between men bound by hard labor.    But the central relationship is between Will and his father Levi, a difficult, stubborn, strong-willed man who considers the shunning of Will for a lifetime a virtue rather than a sin. This exemplifies one of the central themes of the book: our sin, the power of forgiveness, and the bitterness of forgiveness withheld. Will carries his own load of sin: the guilt of abandoning the pregnant Amish girl, Mattie, at Apple Creek with him for decades, the despondency over not being a true father to his illegitimate daughter, his belief that he has caused the death of a man, and his grief about his own failures as a parent to his sons.    Perhaps the strongest part of the book is when Cramer concentrates on Will's need for his father, something that no other relationship --- friendship, marriage --- can replace. Will tries to repair the breech about midway through the book, returning home and facing his father at dusk. Surprised by Will's appearance after so many years, Levi lights a kitchen match and examines his son's face by its dim light. In one of the book's most poignant scenes, Levi rejects Will and storms back to the house. Later in his life, with the breech still unrepaired, Will builds a small fire and Cramer, the narrator, reflects, \\"Even then, a thousand miles and a thousand light years away from Levi Mullet, sometimes Will gazed into the fire and saw before his face the flame of a single match flickering in the breath of his father's condemnation. Even then, some small part of him understood that it was no slavish ambition that drove him to work so hard, but a deep and festering need to prove something.\\"    Eventually, Will faces his own culpability --- his rejection of Mattie and his daughter, his own shortcomings in his marriage, and hisfailures in parenting his own sons. The sins of the fathers reverberate through generations. Despite the tense relationship themes, this is a quiet novel, thought-provoking rather than a page-turner. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for the power of forgiveness, the need for reconciliation in relationships, and the cost of repeating the same mistakes through generations.

S. Lewis: \\"We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us.\\" Then comes Patterson's first paragraph: \\"A poll conducted by the George Barna organization a few years ago discovered that the number one desire of most Americans was to be thinner. Number two was to be richer.\\" <br /> <br />That opening sets up Patterson's engaging style --- providing meaty content, including biblical exposition, literary quotes, and historical insight, in an anecdotal context. He sets up a thirst for joy and then walks you through the satisfaction of responding to God in a way that engenders joy. <br /> <br />HE HAS MADE ME GLAD would be appropriate to give to a non-Christian who is curious about the Christian faith. In early chapters Patterson lays out the basics of the gospel message. What's so amazing about grace? He clearly answers the question and, further, explains that if we really understand it, our response is one of gratitude. He quotes theologian Karl Barth: \\"Gratitude follows grace like thunder lightning.\\" <br /> <br />But the book also has much to offer a seasoned Christian, especially in an early chapter titled \\"Joy Busters,\\" gently reminding us that past disappointments, myopia, and fear of losing control can block the joy God wants to give us. And also in the six chapters describing \\"habits of joy\\" --- these habits being compared to \\"the ways we spread our sails\\" to catch the \\"wind\\" of the Holy Spirit, who gives us the \\"gift\\" of joy. The habits? Gratitude in all things. Awareness of God's presence and love. Participation in a church community. Sabbath rest. Conversation that builds up rather than tears down. Generosity. <br /> <br />In termsof personal anecdote, Patterson, a former pastor and now college chaplain (and a husband and father of four grown children), admits to rare moments of dancing for joy around the living room. \\"Sometimes joy sweeps me off my feet, but more often,\\" he continues, \\"it courts me and asks for a decision\\" --- a choice to raise one of the habitual sails. <br /> <br />The book is a bit repetitious --- Pascal's ecstatic conversion account being quoted twice, for example, and the last chapter being a partial reprise of the first --- but one hardly notices. I, for one, was turning pages and turning to prayer, allowing my spirit to reach toward heaven. <br /> <br />And now I turn to my bookcase: For probably 10 years Patterson's early book, WAITING: FINDING HOPE WHEN GOD SEEMS SILENT, has been nestled, unread, on a crowded shelf in my living room. Maybe it's time I picked it up. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2005-08-03

If you were to ask one of Julie Anne Fidler's friends what has defined her young marriage thus far, \\"chaos\\" is the likely answer. Julie got the flu on her honeymoon and a week later her groom had emergency double knee surgery. \\"Frankly, I think this set the tone for several years to come,\\" Julie writes in her book about their matrimonial misadventures. <br /> <br />ADVENTURES IN HOLY MATRIMONY is a unique and welcome addition to the pantheon of marriage literature. In it Fidler recounts the rough and tumble first few years of her marriage to Scott --- a marriage that stood on the brink of divorce and, happily, remains intact. But this is no fairy tale. <br /> <br />\\"I had these grandiose dreams about marriage, which were not entirely unlike the dreams of any other young woman. I had my entire wedding planned out by the time I was twelve, right down to the flavor of the filling in the cake. (It was raspberry and it was delicious.) Every love song on the radio evoked that first dance... <br /> <br />Sure you can have a beautiful marriage, but it's not all wine and roses. I can't tell you how many people tried to warn us that it wasn't always going to be a dream come true. We just didn't want to listen. Anyone who told us anything other than what we wanted to hear was promptly shut out and dismissed as trying to ruin the great thing we had... <br /> <br />We should have listened. <br /> <br />It turned out that married life was a trial by fire. We went from whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears at the reception to practically wringing each other's necks in the bedroom.\\" <br /> <br />Fidler goes on to explain that her husband's medical condition, essentially super high levels of iron in his blood, began to affect his ability to have sex almost immediately after their wedding. That caused frustration for both of them, physical communication broke down, and other forms of communication quickly followed. Scott got sicker. Jobs were lost. Surgeries were had. Bills piled up. And the newlyweds drifted apart. <br /> <br />On top of these \\"external\\" forces pulling them apart, Julie and Scott were also carrying a fair amount of internal baggage in the form of difficult childhoods, different sexual histories and shared sexual missteps, and bipolar disorder. These \\"internal\\" forces also worked against the union and Julie shares them all with a refreshing honesty. <br /> <br />ADVENTURES IN HOLY MATRIMONY isn't your typical \\"rah-rah\\" book about marriage. It's actually a lot more useful (and hopeful) than most of those books. The problems in the Fidler marriage aren't sanitized or presented in a certain light just so they can be neatly resolved at the end. And because of that, anyone in a less-than-perfect marriage is going to recognize themselves here and take away this message: if Julie and Scott are making it work, my partner and I can too. <br /> <br />That's the hope part. The useful part comes in the form of reflection questions at the end of each chapter and practical advice on things like newlywed finances and what it will really take to patch the holes in troubled relationships. <br /> <br />Julie and Scott's relationship might be atypical to some extent. Perhaps most couples experience a more serene \\"honeymoon phase.\\" They certainly have dealt with a confluence of very specific ailments. But for those facing rough matrimonial seas (or for those considering marriage), ADVENTURES IN HOLY MATRIMONY is an optimistic, yet frank, friend. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-03

Fischer, like many writers, finds inspiration for his writing direct from the bean, as he plugs in his laptop at his local coffee shop. \\"I love coffee. I love it dark, oily, and with a burnt chestnut aftertaste,\\" he writes. Unsurprisingly, he loves Starbucks --- indeed, the book is almost an endorsement for the chain. \\"...Just about everything I can think of about my experience with Starbucks coffee also corresponds to something true about my experience with Jesus.\\"    Although he is a Starbucks aficionado, many of the essays Fischer crafts are birthed at the Koffee Klatch, a local hangout. Surprisingly to him, as he becomes a regular, his little coffee shop turns out to be a magnet for the gay community in his little corner of California. This realization leads Fischer to ponder evangelism and his own desire to keep to himself. Is he there as only a coffee drinker? Observer? As a Christian looking for converts? Should he offer them some \\"answers?\\" He's not sure. With honest puzzlement, he muses over why he feels motivated to evangelize those around him. Is it truly that he cares about them, or \\"Is it to speed up their change so I don't have to be so freaked out around them?\\"    Fischer's discomfort with his feelings at the Koffee Klatch leads him to peel back more layers. He thinks back to his earliest experiences in an ultra-conservative Christian home (he carried a note to school excusing him from dancing in gym) and his teen perceptions of evangelism, and participation. He finds he enjoys observing life rather than participating and engaging with it. \\"Confession: As a Christian, I am the bearer of a message packed full of love for people I am afraid to be around.\\" His favorite part of evangelism, he confesses: \\"busing out\\" after witnessing in a neighborhood. Throughout the book, he continues turning over thoughts about his lack of empathy with others and his desire to withdraw. Sometimes there is a point to his musings, sometimes it is a little difficult to discern what the point is.    In another essay, Fischer, a hardcore caffeinated coffee drinker, acknowledges that his own faith has been \\"decaffeinated\\" too long. \\"Religion without a kick...faith without the buzz --- a sanitized human experience with its heart and soul removed....\\" He reflects on his early experiences in the church: prom night without the dancing, Rook instead of regular cards, Billy Graham movies instead of the headliner down at the theater. \\"We simply tried to take out what we thought was bad and still have the experience,\\" he writes. He decides he wants an \\"earthy\\" faith, not a life lived in isolation. \\"My caffeinated Christianity is a relationship with God that takes into account my life in this body and my handicap as a sinner.\\"    As for the gay community at the Koffee Klatch, where everyone is \\"out of the closet,\\" Fischer realizes, \\"Me? I tend to be a closet sinner, keeping my coffee and my conversation to myself. So I keep coming back to the Koffee Klatch. And each time, I find my heart a little softer, a little more aware of how special everyone is in God's eyes.\\" As for witnessing there, he decides, \\"It's time to get over myself and start being a friend...(to) find out what I have in common with all the other caffeine fanatics here.\\"    Those who listened to Fischer back in the early 1980s will recognize some echoes of his songs in these essays, including the inspiration for \\"Roses on Wednesday,\\" a sweet essay about marital commitment (and no coffee themed relationship in sight, by the way). However, despite some strong material, there is a rambling aspect to this book that makes it a better choice to pick up and read in short bursts rather than as one long narrative.

US	30329810	R2JVBVLL2OL6PW	0785201327	686761687	Prayers For Mothers Of Newborns	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Upbeat and humorous devotional prayers	Angela Thomas, mother of four, knows firsthand the joys and challenges of a new baby in the house, and through her PRAYERS FOR MOTHERS OF NEWBORNS (previously published as PRAYERS FOR NEW MOTHERS) she becomes a trusted companion for the rollercoaster ride of becoming a new mom.    The first-person narrative prayers are organized into five sections: \\"The First Days,\\" \\"Joyfulness, Tears, and Rest,\\" \\"Fears and Anticipations,\\" \\"All to Jesus (I Surrender),\\" and \\"Blessings,\\" generally following a new mom through the first months of parenthood. Ten to twenty different short devotional prayers appropriate to the section follow, plus a scripture verse for each reading. Baby showers, breast-feeding challenges, sleep-deprivation, the chaos of undone housework, holidays, the baby's first smile, unshed pregnancy pounds, teething --- all are taken to God in prayer.    There are prayers of awe and amazement, as when Thomas gazes at her newborn daughter and exclaims to God, \\"Although I tried, I could not imagine the magnificent work You were doing in the secret place of my womb ... I feel keenly aware that my life will never be the same ... How did I ever live without her?\\"    She prays out of concern when her newborn becomes jaundiced, and a home healthcare nurse turns their house into a makeshift pediatric unit. \\"So very early, I must learn to trust You to care for Anna Grace. I do. She belongs to You....\\" Thomas prays out of frustration when nothing she does calms her crying baby: \\"She's come undone. I've come unglued. I don't know what else to do ... God ... Give calm and assurance to her little spirit. Let her rest peacefully.\\"    In \\"Aftershocks\\" Thomas laments the afterbirth pains she feels, taking it to God: \\"Lord ... I'm frazzled. I'm crying. I desperately need Your comfort and healing.\\" In another reading, she struggles with postpartum depression: \\"I am overwhelmed ... Night sweats and chills ... A numb heart paralyzes all of me ... Wipe these tears away, and give my husband patience ... Restore bright days and my hope for the future.\\" New mothers will be comforted knowing that they are not alone in their \\"blue\\" days.    Thomas also prays for her friends who are moms --- the new mother whose husband recently has filed for divorce, the friend whose baby has Down Syndrome, the woman who adopts. And, in becoming a mother, Thomas gains a new appreciation for her own mother --- something that parenting tends to inspire. \\"Lord, her legacy is one that I long to pass on ... Continue to teach me through Mama how to love my babies well.\\"    While honestly acknowledging the many challenges of having a newborn --- coping with sickness, sleepless nights, disruptions in routine, and total exhaustion --- Thomas's devotional prayers are mostly upbeat, sometimes even humorous (\\"Thank you that a belt is in my future and that baggy jeans might work pretty soon\\"). Most prayers end on a note of gratitude and praise.    Although new moms might pick up this book for themselves, this is clearly packaged as gift-giving material. The lavender hardcover is gender neutral, and a purple ribbon marker and decorated endpapers are a nice touch. Less attractive are the rather uninspired black-and-white photos0000000king for help in articulating the joys, exhaustion, anxieties and delight that only a newborn baby can bring.

For people of many faiths, Sarah is a tantalizing figure, and Marek Halter brings her vividly to life in this colorful portrait.    As with Anita Diamant's THE RED TENT, Halter uses the image of menstruation or \\"bridal blood\\" as the axis around which the story revolves. After a brief prologue, the story opens as Sarai (her name before God changed it to Sarah) wakes to find she has begun menstruating. Although prepared for it by her relatives, Sarai despairs because in her home culture of Ur, a girl becomes a bride after her first period.    On her wedding night, sensing that her prospective bridegroom is wildly attractive yet desperately cruel, she flees the festivities to the outskirts of town. Muddy and disheveled, she meets the young Abram (later renamed Abraham), with whom she finds an instant chemistry. Discovered, Sarai returns in disgrace to her father's house for several months. Fearing becoming betrothed again, she resorts to the herbs of a local witch, dosing herself and becoming infertile. Since she no longer menstruates, she is chosen to become a high priestess. Blood continues to be a motif through the endless sacrifices made to the gods of Ur.    Several years later Abram returns and Sarai escapes again, this time to marry him. Abram, interestingly portrayed as a partner with his family in making household gods, hears a voice from \\"The One God\\" that calls him to begin a journey of whose end he is unsure. With him is his nephew, the orphaned Lot, who develops a rather incestuous, unhealthy fascination with his foster-mother Sarai (a good illustration of Halter liberally adapting the biblical story to provide more intrigue).    In a time when women were valued for the number of sons they could produce, Sarai mourns her infertility, but Abram assures her of his love. Strangely, as Sarai ages, her beauty remains unmarredby the passage of time. This is a rather spooky and fantastic addition to the story by Halter: \\"The weight of this silent miracle, though at first it delighted her, was beginning to terrify Sarai herself.\\" Her beauty leads to a plot development straight out of the biblical text, when the couple and their entourage pass through Egypt, and Abraham, fearing for his life, passes Sarai off as his sister. In some steamy passages, Pharoah takes her to bed. She is returned to Abraham after Pharoah dreams that God wreaks havoc on him (another liberty with the scriptural text) and relationships between Abram and Sarai are strained for some time afterwards.    Abram's eventual desire for a child culminates in several tense plot developments that readers familiar with the Old Testament account will recognize. Blood continues to be a motif throughout the book, culminating in the tense scene where Abraham takes their only son Isaac to sacrifice him to God. Sarai, now Sarah, observing the scene, pleads with God for her son's life --- and Abraham stays his hand.    Halter writes good descriptions of the time, including food, geographic settings, and the various clothing worn by the characters. Unlike many more conservative biblical novels (think the wonderfully nuanced portrayals by Francine Rivers's \\"Lineage of Grace\\" series), Halter is frank in his depictions of the sexual attraction between the two, and in his portrayals of sex between various characters throughout the book.    This is the first book in The Canaan Trilogy, exploring the lives of biblical women through fiction (the second, ZIPPORAH, looks at the little-known life of the wife of Moses). Book groups will welcome the reading group guide, included at the end.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. (...)	2005-08-03

Primarily he hoped to delve more deeply into each section of the prayer and to explore its deeper practical applications. Also, he felt it necessary to clarify some of the misconceptions that led to controversy over the first book.    \\"And Jabez called upon the God of Israel saying,  'Oh that You would bless me indeed,  and enlarge my territory,   that Your hand would be with me,   and that You would keep me from evil,  that I may not cause pain.'  So God granted him what he requested.\\" 1 Chron. 4:10    This is the prayer that inspired the books and generated strong debate among Christian factions, especially extremists at either end of the spectrum. There were those who decried it as another \\"name it and claim it\\" gimmick while others were bursting with positive testimonies of personal miracles when they \\"prayed Jabez.\\" Dr. Wilkinson says that he never meant for it to be a mantra or a magic lamp but simply a model to help people enrich their prayer lives.    I remember buying the book as a Christmas present for my son. And I prayed the prayer just to see what would happen. Within two days my already bloated caseload increased 25%. The Lord increased my territory! Reinforcing a truth that we often forget, God's ways are not our ways. What we might have in mind and what He has in mind are often entirely different.    While it's true that God cares about our smallest needs and can provide a parking place right up front on a day that you're in a hurry, it's 110 degrees and your hip is killing you. On the other hand, when you get home you may receive that dreaded phone call telling you that the friend everyone at church has been praying for did not survive her latest stroke. So, what's the deal? The real deal is God's sovereignty. His ways are not our ways and we'll never understand everything. We just have to trust that He knows what He is doing. Whether you \\"pray Jabez\\", address Him in King James English, or talk to Him as you would to your loving Father, the key is the relationship.    BEYOND JABEZ is an inspiring sequel to THE PRAYER OF JABEZ and is sure to help those who read it expand their understanding of the importance of prayer and faith.

Don't expect a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" because in Ashley's world that definitely is not going to happen. Ashley's march toward the aisle has never been simple, and this remaining leg of the journey is no different. As she prepares for her marriage to Dr. Kevin Novak, a series of sitcom and soap opera events make for a delightful few hours of vacation reading.    Ashley quickly discovers that the downside of marrying a really sweet and sensitive man is that he's sweet and sensitive toward everyone, including her antagonists --- who, in this case, happen to be his sister Emily and his mother. Ashley has dreamed of her wedding for 30 years and has definite ideas of what and how she wants to have things done: slick, high-tech, Silicon Valley, Vera Wang simplicity. Emily, on hiatus from job hunting in Atlanta, envisions a Gone With the Wind spectacular, complete with Scarlett and Rhett matching outfits and an attending Confederate Army Guard. However, Mother Novak thinks an appropriate shower gift is a certificate to finishing school!    Neither Ashley nor her best friends --- Brea, Kay (her roommate), and Mei Ling (her brother's wife) --- are any match for the self-appointed wedding planner when she sets her mind to a task. Emily will only be in California for a short time so she gets busy and cancels the wedding dress that Ashley ordered, begins sketching bridesmaid gowns, and lines up caterers for the themed event originally known as Ashley and Kevin's wedding. Whenever Ashley objects, master manipulator Emily quiets her with, \\"You do want to make mah brothah happy, don't you?\\"    As if pre-wedding jitters and a hostile takeover by the Confederacy were not enough, Ashley's firm has hired her ex-boyfriend and he is having second thoughts about their breakup. Not to worry. This is a romance.And Kristin Billerbeck does not disappoint. All ends well as Dr. Novak finally asserts himself and saves the day.

Lott's narrative opens as Ruth loses her husband in a terrible accident. Her mother-in-law, Naomi, a widow whose husband died eight years before, is plunged into renewed grief (the song she knows by heart). Throughout the book, Lott uses the image of light and darkness to illustrate deeper meanings. As the two inconsolable widows wait for morning together, \\"Shadows outside eased and shifted, made way for new shadows, all of this movement only the empty fruit of that faithless sun.\\" Later, as Ruth and Naomi try to do ordinary things, such as see a movie, they find it devastating, \\"like sitting in the dark and watching a life played out just beyond your reach, that life your own.\\"    Seeking healing from her pain, Naomi declares her intention to go back home to South Carolina, \\"called by the force of whatever mystery the place I'd once called home and would call home again held out to me.\\" As readers of scripture will quickly guess, Ruth vows to go with her. After a yard sale where the women divest themselves of almost everything, they journey back to Naomi's childhood region.    Other themes unfold. Naomi grieves over a secret from her past for which she is unable to forgive someone --- and herself. She finds the area she was nostalgic for from her childhood is not as she recalled it. Now, there are satellite dishes, video stores, tattoo parlors, sushi bars, Taco Bells. \\"Time moved, whether you liked it or not.\\" Naomi also realizes she is not the same person she once was in this place. She has run, but \\"I hadn't run from me. I'd only run from our home, and from the death of our son, and from God for having taken from me the last evidence of the love Eli and I shared,\\" reflects Naomi.    Things have changed. Yet, \\"It's still beautiful here,\\" Ruth tells her. \\"The light is just like you said it would be.\\" It is the light --- and descriptions of the light --- that serve as a reminder by Lott that God can pierce the darkness of grief by his love and grace. \\"Still He was with me,\\" says Naomi.    Readers will enjoy how Lott adapts the Old Testament story to a contemporary setting. Ruth gets a job as a checker at the Piggly Wiggly grocery store, then finds a better one as a shift supervisor at a Harris Teeter. Naomi finds some peace in returning to her family, full of interesting characters, and Ruth finds a welcome as well. A quilt serves as a symbol of the relationships left behind, and the possibilities for mending their lives. When Ruth falls in love with a fireman, the quilt becomes the proverbial blessing/covering passed on by Naomi for their new relationship.    Although readers have criticized Lott for choosing style over plot substance in A SONG I KNEW BY HEART, the joy of this book is exactly that --- in how Lott can take a familiar subject (both the biblical account and the loss of a loved one) and make it sing. Of his early Oprah-pick novel, JEWEL, the Boston Globe noted, \\"Bret Lott has a gift for making the ordinary seem luminous.\\" This gift is in full evidence here, as Lott illuminates the ordinary landscape of grief and reminds us that light always overcomes the darkness.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

The second thing you should know is that it's a work of Christian literary fiction. And the third thing you should know is that it's a work that offers further proof that God has not given up on the Christian publishing industry. <br /> <br />In case I haven't made myself clear, let me do so now: I loved GRACE AT LOW TIDE. <br /> <br />The story is told from the perspective of DeVeaux DeLoach, a teenager whose father, Billy, has suffered one business failure too many. His latest debacle has forced the family to move from their fine home in Charleston to a caretaker's cottage on the grounds of Rose Hill Plantation, which used to be the family plantation. From their new home in the South Carolina low country, the family has a clear view of a multi-million dollar development rising on a nearby island --- the very project that did Billy's business in and sent the family packing for poorer quarters. <br /> <br />If you've ever known a bona fide member of pretentious Southern gentility, the name DeVeaux DeLoach just has to make you chuckle inside. Who else would couple the name DeVeaux with DeLoach but an aristocratic wannabe? And one of those wannabes is named Billy! Oh my. I guess you can take the aristocrat out of the Southerner, but you just can't take the Southerner out of the aristocrat. I love it. <br /> <br />DeVeaux, who has been forced to leave prep school to attend the local high school, now spends her free time waiting tables rather than focusing on those accomplishments that will impress university admissions departments. As the story unfolds, she serves as a highly attached observer as she and her family try to adjust to their deteriorating circumstances. Billy's way of \\"adjusting,\\" however, involves throwing temper tantrums --- even less attractive for an adult than for a two-year-old --- berating DeVeaux, mocking her mother, and treating those things that the two women love as if it was yesterday's garbage. Which is exactly what some of those things become. <br /> <br />Now to the factors that make this a distinctly Christian novel and why I hope other Christian authors and publishers will sit up and take notice of what the author has done here. DeVeaux's faith is evident throughout the book, in what she says, how she thinks, and what she does, such as attend youth group meetings in Charleston despite the difficulty she sometimes has in getting there. (An aside: There's a brand-new car she could use, but Billy refuses to let anyone, including himself, drive it. The car was a gift, and his pride can't handle that.) What sets Beth Webb Hart apart from many other evangelical authors is her subtle and graceful handling of DeVeaux's faith. There's never the slightest hint of preachiness in this faith-rich story. <br /> <br />Orbiting the DeLoaches' lives are a number of well-drawn characters, like DeVeaux's Cousin Eli, who helps her retain her sanity; the Shuzuki family, who bought Rose Hill and are in the process of renovating it; Maum Bess, Billy's childhood nanny, and her son Chambers, who live nearby; Bethany, the youth group leader; C.C., with whom DeVeaux has her first official date; and several other human characters. But among the leading characters in GRACE AT LOW TIDE is the South Carolina low country, which serves as far more than simply a backdrop to the story. <br /> <br />Hart, the author of this debut novel, is a creative writing teacher and my nominee for Writing Teacher of the Year. I don't know if she teaches at writers' conferences, but I certainly hope so. In fact, I think some of our bestselling Christian novelists ought to be forced to spend a week under her mentorship. This woman is so talented that I'm ready to travel to Charleston so I can take in a few sessions with her.	2005-08-03

While reading JoAnna Harris's book, YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE ME: When \\"The One\\" Turns Out To Be Just Someone, the idea occurred to me that maybe we should start expanding the term to include nonfiction. If ever a book screamed \\"Chick Lit\\" it's YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE ME. <br /> <br />JoAnna's missive to the lovelorn masses was born out of her own heartache. Two major breakups set the stage: Jack, college best friend, said he wanted to grow old with her but couldn't marry her because she wasn't pretty enough; Ross, fiance, bailed out two months before their wedding and less than one week after she had left her life in Nashville to be with him in Boston. Ouch. Double ouch. <br /> <br />Of the day Ross calls it quits, she writes: \\"That night when he leaves he hugs me. It feels like hugging a stranger or an acquaintance that sorta creeps you out. Like dancing with the weird guy at the wedding because it's the wedding party dance and he's your wedding party counterpart. His arms are wrapped tightly around you and you can't escape without making a scene so you do your best to throw your head back, hoping to appear as if you're laughing but really you're trying to flee gracefully. I want to hug him and feel good. To feel like I once did. To feel safe and loved and together. Instead it feels wooden. Artificial. And I know it's over.\\" <br /> <br />Joanna pairs such in-the-moment, heart-on-your-sleeve candor with humor and spot-on observations about navigating our own and society's expectations about love. <br /> <br />\\"When I was engaged it made me feel like a celebrity. Made me exciting to strangers. Made people sit up and take notice. Hey everybody, look at me! Somebody loves me! A boy thinks I'm pretty! I remember buying stationary at a card shop and the salesclerk oohing and aahing over my engagement ring and wanting to know all about my dress and the flowers and the cake and ... oh yeah, the guy. IfI went in today, she would tell me my total and hand me a receipt.\\" <br /> <br />JoAnna chronicles her romantic misadventures with a \\"just between us girls\\" sensibility, and just like one of your girlfriends, she can ramble a bit. And be inconsistent. And tell you things that are kinda embarrassing in the light of day. But you listen anyway because she's your friend, and if you're honest, she reminds you a bit of yourself, warts and all. <br /> <br />When all is said and done, JoAnna finds a wholeness in Christ that isn't clich or trite, but is sufficient. If you've been unlucky in love, have a friend going through a painful breakup, or you just want to have a good gabfest (well, she's gabbing) about love, then I definitely recommend YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE ME. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-03

But because its message is so compelling you keep reading, realizing it is virtually impossible to absorb it all. Which means that once you turn the last page, you're forced to start reading it again. Immediately. <br /> <br />Dr. Tim Kimmel's latest work, WHY CHRISTIAN KIDS REBEL: Trading Heartache for Hope, is such a book. Its title is a bit misleading. A better title, I think, would have been REBELLION PREVENTION 101. Quite simply, Kimmel's book is not about kids' rebellion --- though he addresses it --- but rather about the condition of a parent's heart. And if you're a parent --- a Christian parent --- I have to warn you, his words make for some very uncomfortable reading at times. Very uncomfortable.  <br /> <br />Before you stop reading the rest of this review, give me one more moment of your time. It's important. If you're a parent trying to raise a child in a Christian home and you would like to see them carry on in the faith as they grow and start their own families, then YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />Statistics bear out that nearly 90 percent of evangelical children leave the church after high school --- and many never return. Why is that? What happens? Where do we go wrong? <br /> <br />Kimmel holds the church and the adults sitting in its pews accountable for not meeting the needs of the children God has entrusted to their care. But what makes his style so remarkable is that he is not harsh or accusatory. I read this book with several \\"filters\\" working at once. As a journalist, I read it critically to make sure it flowed and was logically sound. It did. I also read it as a Christian, making sure it was theologically sound. It was. And I also read it as a Christian mother of four boys, trying to raise them not to rebel against me, my husband, or God, the way that I rebelled against my parents and God. <br /> <br />I was brought up in a fundamentalist home and was made to attend a fundamentalist college. Being \\"Christian\\" was who we were and what we did. I walked away from both as soon as I could and didn't look back until my first son was born. His sweet face and my newly repentant heart required me to start looking critically at my upbringing --- taking the good, and leaving the arbitrary legalism behind, making many mistakes in the process. <br /> <br />Kimmel lays out the mistakes that we Christian parents make, such as treating our faith as a hobby. And, like other hobbies of ours that do not interest our children, they choose not to pursue it. Kimmel writes: \\"That's how kids in Christian homes sometimes respond to their parents' faith. Since to them it's like a spiritual hobby for their parents, their interest in it might be more temporary than permanent. The good news is that although Christianity can be treated like a hobby, an authentic relationship with Christ can't.\\" <br /> <br />And just when you think you can't be anymore convicted, he turns it up a notch. In chapter eight, Kimmel addresses \\"Cocoon Christianity\\" as follows: \\"They construct a handy and holy haven designed to accommodate their children's vulnerabilities indefinitely. It's a strategy that formats their childhood so deeply that it often becomes the defining attitude of their adulthood... (Parents) are convinced that if the world system can get to their children, it would certainly get a hold of their hearts. It would either conscript them into its army of sin, force them to work in its factories of shame, or simply destroy them. So parents hide their children in safe evangelical enclaves.\\" <br /> <br />Only thing is, Kimmel says, is that when our children come out of our cocoon, they are \\"not prepared to handle what's waiting for them.\\" <br /> <br />Kimmel also describes the four stylesof parenting: \\"Clueless,\\" \\"EMT,\\" \\"Special Forces\\" and \\"Grace-Based,\\" as well as the various forms of \\"Christianity,\\" taking time to describe the effects each has on the family unit in general and the child in particular. I guarantee that you will recognize yourself in one of them. Kimmel also makes it clear that even though there are things parents can do to minimize the possibility that their children will be inclined toward rebellion, it is still likely that there will be kids who are raised \\"well\\" who will choose to go their own way, no matter what. <br /> <br />Reading his words will break your heart and humble you because Kimmel refuses to call sin by any other name. This is how he concludes: \\"If you are not interested in utilizing God's grace when it comes to dealing with your errant child, not to mention dealing with yourself, there is little help I (or anybody else) can offer you.\\" <br /> <br />Yet throughout this book, Kimmel's writing is filled with hope and flawless logic; you can't help but be inspired to change course and readjust. If you're a Christian parent, then YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. The future of your child's faith depends on it. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2005-08-03

All is vanity!\\" <br /> <br />If you said Solomon, the ancient king of Israel, you'd be right. It's the opening refrain from Ecclesiastes, uttered after Solomon goes on the ultimate road trip, searching the world for meaning and happiness. He goes on to describe his journeys and offers observations including, \\"A human being is no better off than an animal because life has no meaning for either. They are both going to the same place --- the dust.\\" And, \\"In this world you find wickedness where justice and right ought to be ... If you love money you will never be satisfied; if you long to be rich, you will never get all you want. The richer you are, the more mouths you have to feed.\\" For the most part, the book is a downer. <br /> <br />It would be tempting to skip over Ecclesiastes. To not delve into its hopelessness and wrestle with why it's part of Scripture. But as renowned bible teacher Charles Swindoll points out in his book, LIVING ON THE RAGGED EDGE, Ecclesiastes is as true and relevant and important today as it was thousands of years ago. <br /> <br />\\"Ecclesiastes has today's world woven through the fabric of every page. Whether or not we are willing to admit it, deep within most of us there is this restless, irresponsible, adventuresome itch. Deadlines and responsibilities grate at us. We find ourselves ready to run --- to escape into the back road of our memories, to travel down the blue highways of life under the sun. 'Surely, there I will find what it takes to fill the void.' Before we are able to crank up the car Solomon's advice brings us back to reality: 'Don't bother, it's a pipe dream, empty as a puff of smoke, lacking in substance. It may look like it's worth the effort, but don't bother, life without God under the sun is despair personified.''' <br /> <br />And that's the catch; life without God is worthless. <br /> <br />Still, Swindoll doesn't blithely skip to that part, spoutingplatitudes about God's goodness along the way. He doesn't pull any punches in describing the world we live in and his take on life is refreshingly honest as he describes the dissatisfaction, discouragement, and despair so many people feel. We are all living on the ragged edge, as he puts it, and ignoring that fact doesn't make us better Christians. <br /> <br />This book, however, does have insight that can make the Christian life more vibrant and authentic. <br /> <br />\\"The good life --- the one that truly satisfies --- exists only when we stop wanting a better one. It is the condition of savoring what is, rather than longing for what might be. The itch for things, the lust for more --- so brilliantly injected by those who peddle them --- is a virus draining our souls of happy contentment. Have you noticed? A man never earns enough.

It makes for page-turning fiction.<br /><br />Magician Joshua Lazarus, his young wife Maggie, and his sister Geneva have been struggling to make a living and travel in an old camper. The trio is nearly on their last dollar. Out on the beach late at night, Lazarus rescues a wealthy and depressed former actress, Julia Madsen, from committing suicide, through listening to the \\"spirits.\\"<br /><br />The magic show is transformed into a new television program called \\"The Other Side,\\" where Joshua listens to the spirits and speaks for them. The show becomes an instant hit and a magazine called StarField interviews Lazarus and writes about the program. \\"StarField called 'The Other Side' a cultural phenomenon, another quest to answer what happens after death. What will happen to me after death? Joshua supplied a user-friendly answer. The departed forget the pain but not the love...\\" During the pilot program, Lazarus speaks to a young girl, Tanya Roper, wrestling with her recent abortion and the pressure from her mother. The generic \\"prophetic\\"-like speech propels Tayna to kill her mother and then herself the next day. Penn Roper, the father, vows revenge and takes up a secret identity as Ben Cord, a security expert working for Lazarus. Roper/Cord uses his security expertise to trap Lazarus. It's only one of several plot strands in this novel.<br /><br />The well-crafted characters, intriguing plot and dialogue kept me turning the pages toward a chilling ending that rivals many secular fiction books in this genre. Reading a Mackel book is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded. You believe the ride is leveling off and almost finished, just as the characters are relatively safe. Then the plot plunges around another twist and the reader hangs on tight for another jolt.<br /><br />In a realistic way, Maggie meets Jesus through the lifestyle evangelism of Amy Howland, who runs a ministry for children called Safe Haven in a poor neighborhood. The spiritual battle is full-blown between the spiritualists and the Christians, and the plot reminds us of our necessity to follow truth from the Bible --- not the false truth from mankind. Woven into the fabric of this book is solid biblical teaching about the occult and the necessity for each of us to cling in faith to Jesus. But the Bible teaching doesn't come in a contrived manner. For example, when Maggie, the new Christian, talks with her husband Joshua about his work in the spirit world, the worlds collide and he says, \\"So it's come down to this.

As Jennifer O'Neill writes, \\"You cannot argue with someone's pain.\\" You can dismiss it, you can minimize it, you can ignore it, but you cannot effectively use your powers of persuasion to convince other people that they are not in pain. In YOU'RE NOT ALONE, O'Neill, an actress and Cover Girl Cosmetics model, writes primarily to those women who continue to suffer from the emotional pain of abortion --- and she writes as one who has been there. <br /> <br />In previous books and videos and in her ongoing role as national spokesperson for the \\"Silent No More\\" abortion awareness campaign, O'Neill tells the story of her own abortion, the struggles that followed, and her ultimate reconciliation with God. Here, she gives space to the stories of other women who have likewise suffered and found hope and healing through God's forgiveness. Throughout, O'Neill uses scripture to underscore the truth that God's grace and mercy are available to everyone --- even those women who feel they've bordered on committing the unpardonable sin by aborting a child. <br /> <br />On that score, O'Neill does a terrific job. If you don't get a taste of God's grace and forgiveness while reading this book, well, I guess you just weren't ready for it. Because it's there for the taking. On every page. O'Neill also addresses two aspects of the post-abortion experience that often go unnoticed: the need to openly grieve for the aborted child and the need to confess the truth about a previous abortion to a spouse and children. <br /> <br />One of the most poignant scenes in the book relates to the need to grieve. In Japan for a film festival, O'Neill wanted to do some sightseeing and decided to visit a large Buddhist temple. In one area on the grounds were thousands upon thousands of pinwheels. Next to some were tiny mementos --- empty photo frames, knitted booties, and the like. What she was looking at was the burial ground for aborted babies, a place where people could openly mourn the loss of their own child or for all of the anonymous children lost to abortion. \\"Grieving is part of surviving and is an integrally crucial part of the healing process,\\" O'Neill writes. \\"Grieving is not a step you can skip if you want to heal.\\" All too often, the shame of abortion causes women to skip that step, she writes, but the repercussions will surface eventually. <br /> <br />O'Neill also guides women through the process of determining when, how, and if they should disclose the fact of a long-ago abortion to their current family --- their spouse and children. It's a process designed not to convince the women that they should or shouldn't, but to allow each woman to come to her own decision about how to handle the situation. <br /> <br />Now to the downside. This is a book that is likely to resonate with Christians only. That's not to say that a person who isn't a Christian wouldn't get anything out of it, but that person would have to be heavily steeped in Christian jargon. [Note to software developers: Please, please, create a \\"Christianese Check\\" just like spell check or grammar check.] \\"Stronghold\\" means little or nothing to someone outside the faith, and \\"bondage\\" means something you don't mention in polite society. Using plain English instead of Christianese would have helped this book immensely. <br /> <br />And even though O'Neill writes primarily to women who have aborted their babies, she also intends to reach their loved ones and anyone who needs a better understanding of post-abortion trauma. Well, that to me includes those pro-life activists who remain blissfully unaware of the additional pain and suffering they cause to women who are already burdened by guilt and shame. Please note: I did not say all activists. I mean those who are so blinded by their zeal to protect the unborn that they disregard the suffering of those who failed to protect their own unborn. O'Neill devotes precious little space to that problem, and it's a big one. <br /> <br />She also states that \\"abortion is not a comfortable subject for most sermons,\\" implying that pastors shy away from addressing the issue. But that sure hasn't been my experience, and I've seen more than one woman slip out of church in tears as a pastor railed against those heinous sinners who abort their babies. A book on healing after abortion needs to include the topic of \\"healing from the pain inflicted on you by your alleged brothers and sisters in Christ.\\" <br /> <br />Look, any book that gets a woman past the pain of abortion and into the arms of God [\\"Christianese Check\\" needed!] is worth reading. I just hope this book finds a wider audience than the Christians who understand the lingo, because there are plenty of women out there who may be put off by the jargon but not by the promise of healing.	2005-08-03

Since then, I've reviewed important books on topics that span the spiritual spectrum, from critical theological issues to dastardly religious practices. But without qualification, I can say that no book was more important than this one. David Murrow has struck a nerve that has needed striking for years. <br /> <br />Concerned over the lack of men in church, Murrow began searching for books to explain the phenomenon. Finding none, Murrow did research on men and church attendance, religious experience, and gender-specific behavior. What he discovered alarmed him. <br /> <br />Murrow's purpose, he says, is not to call men back to church but to call the church back to men. A Presbyterian elder in Anchorage, Alaska, Murrow writes that the church has become a hostile environment to men, particularly \\"masculine men\\" who are uncomfortable in the feminized atmosphere of the typical church. From the dcor to the rituals, the ministry opportunities to the language, churches are designed to appeal to their greatest constituency --- women. Though the top leadership is often male, women constitute the backbone of most churches, representing more than 60 percent of the membership and even more of the volunteer force. <br /> <br />Men, Murrow writes, want an authentic faith experience but find church services to be boring and irrelevant (and a whole lot of women say \\"Amen!\\"). As one observer noted, men have nothing real to do at church except serve as ushers --- which at least gives them a chance to move around. They want to be challenged, but they're only challenged to be good husbands and fathers. \\"If we want to shed our reputation as a place for little old ladies of both sexes, we must recapture the challenge of following Jesus,\\" Murrow writes. <br /> <br />One section provides dozens of practical steps churches can take to make their facilities and services more welcoming to men. Among them, in no particular order: Ditch any activity requiring men to hold hands or share their needs with someone they hardly know; develop adventurous, risk-taking opportunities and hands-on projects; emphasize Jesus' aggressive, masculine attributes; become educated about the psychological characteristics and needs of men (an excellent portion of the book); shorten the length of the sermon. \\"Just who decided that the lecture-style sermon was the best way to teach people about Jesus?\\" Murrow asks. \\"According to many studies, a long, uninterrupted monologue is the least effective way to teach people anything!\\" <br /> <br />Now to the women and another reason why this book is so important. Statistics show that more than 20 percent of married women attend church without their husbands. I know those women well; I've been one of those women. They feel alone, abandoned, ashamed, embarrassed, angry, envious, ineffective, and guilty, for starters. Ask a woman where her husband is or why you never see him at church, and the guilt and shame rise to the surface. She may stammer, roll her eyes, and offer an excuse, but inside her head she's thinking, \\"I don't try hard enough to get him to come. I don't pray enough for him. I'm not a good Christian.\\" <br /> <br />Those women need this book and soon. They need to understand why men refuse to go to church, and there's no better resource than the section on \\"Understanding Men and Masculinity.\\" They'll discover why it's impossible for many men to enjoy church, which is why the church has to change rather than the men. Instead of getting angry at their husbands for \\"shaming\\" them, wives can breathe a sigh of relief, realizing it's not their fault. <br /> <br />I know, and I'm sure the author and publisher know, that some people will read the book through a sexist grid. But if you maintain an open mind and an appreciation for the enormous amount of research Murrow did, you may see yourself mirrored in its pages, whether you're a man or a woman. You'll also realize that sexism is not the issue. The issue is nothing less than the spiritual lives of many men and the future of many churches. <br /> <br />Few books genuinely qualify as a \\"must-read.\\" This is one of the few.	2005-08-03

And he had no idea why.\\" Hijackers have taken control of an Aeroflot plane and have charted a path directly for the White House. Stuchenko, a self-made billionaire, is the richest man in Russia and \\"happens\\" to be taking a test ride on the airline before he purchases it and turns it around. Because of the hijacking, U.S. President James \\"Mac\\" MacPherson has no other choice than to blow up the plane before it hits its terrorist target. The incident begins an action-packed read between Russia and the United States.    From Joel C. Rosenberg's previous New York Times bestsellers (THE LAST JIHAD and THE LAST DAYS from Forge Press), I expected a dramatic beginning and he didn't disappoint. Readers of these other books will recognize the lead characters: Jon Bennett, Senior Advisor to the President, and Erin McCoy, also a Senior Advisor to the President who is on loan from the CIA, plus other members of President MacPherson's staff. Don't be concerned if you haven't read the other books in the series, because THE EZEKIEL OPTION stands alone for a tension-filled reading experience. The characters are well-drawn and the dialogue is crisp in this contemporary novel.    Several threads of story lines are started and continued throughout the novel, which makes for fast-paced action in various places on the globe, such as Washington, D.C., Moscow and Jerusalem. After tensions between countries are raised to a high level, there are no \\"easy\\" political solutions to the difficulties. The reader learns about the Ezekiel Option, which is based on a prophecy from Ezekiel 38-39. Dr. Eli Mordechai, the former head of the Israeli Mossad, explains the prophecy to Jon Bennett, saying, \\"A little over twenty-five hundred years ago, a Hebrew prophet named Ezekiel had a vision in which he foresaw a conspiracy that could have been ripped out of this morning's headlines. He saw modern countries then unborn, modern alliances yet unformed, and a day of unspeakable terror, all driven by a tyrant from the north.\\"    The book even includes a veiled reference to the blockbuster Left Behind titles from Tyndale. At one point Jon and Mordechai are instant messaging each other and Mordechai says, \\"jonathan, my friend, just because you have never heard of this prophecy does not mean nobody has...never heard of the left behind series?\\"    \\"I remember a newsweek cover story about it a few years back, but no, never read the books...too busy making money.\\"    \\"how could I forget? ...Well left behind was a series of novels by an evangelical prophecy expert named tim lahaye and a writer named jerry jenkins...about the last days, the rapture, the rise of the antichrist...they sold over 60 million copies.\\"    \\"and?\\"    \\"and the first chapter of left behind refers to the gog and magog prophecy as having already taken place...why?...because lahaye believes Ezekiel 30-39 might very well take place before Christ comes back for his church.\\"    While Rosenberg's story includes characters who are Christians, any mention about the Bible or prayer is several hundred pages into the novel and carefully woven into the plot in an appropriate manner that isn't overdone.    Like any excellent novel in this genre, the tension for the reader grows with each page until you reach a point of no return --- where you have to complete the book in that setting, even if you stay up until the wee hours of the morning, as this reviewer did. In the final pages, everyone is \\"relatively safe\\" and the reader is left waiting for the next Rosenberg novel. I highly recommend this title.       --- Reviewed by W.

If childhood maps out future beliefs and actions, it's no wonder I veer to the right when walking down the sidewalk. If I spin, I twirl right. If I dance, my right foot leads. Perhaps my left-handedness dictates this bent, but I know better. I even look conservative with my understated pageboy, my Keds, and my sundresses. Now if I chose orthopedic sandals, I'd look like a member of PETA. And dreadlocks on this stark white woman? That might land me a delegate position to the Democratic National Convention.\\" <br /> <br />In this rambling narrative style, Ivy continues to wax reminiscent about the Cold War, growing up in a fundamentalist Christian church, her mom's virtues, Stephen Tyler, and hot baths. In one fell swoop, author Lisa Samson provides a neatly developed character whose life is anything but. She's a mother of three, part-owner of the family's restaurant, and a columnist for the local paper. Her mother is elderly, her no-good father only comes around for free meals, her brother is a womanizer, and her sister is self-absorbed. Oh yeah. And her husband is never home. For the last three years he's spent ten months of the year on the road as a singer. <br /> <br />\\"I'm a little mad right now,\\" Ivy tells us, also still in the first chapter. \\"I haven't heard from my husband, Rusty, in three days. Granted, he's busy singing tenor for a traveling gospel barbershop quartet, Heavenly Harmonies, but would it be so hard to turn on the blinkin' cell phone before the concert begins and just say hi? <br /> <br />Frankly, I'll take anger over dear any day. At least anger buffs you up. <br /> <br />Lemons out of lemonade. Hmm Well, let's see now. Three days incommunicado may just equal that new light fixture I want for the front porch. Oh yeah. Drink up, Rusty. I just won this one.\\" <br /> <br />Ivy may have \\"won\\" that one, but her busy (and lonely) life is quickly stretched to the breaking point. Her mother falls and begins to suffer from dementia, so she moves in with the Ivy brood. Then the no-good dad needs a place to stay. And, wouldn't you know, so does Rusty's dad. Before you know it, Chez Schneider is a glorified boarding house and Ivy finds herself firmly sandwiched between serving the needs of her parents and the needs of her children. <br /> <br />It's from this predicament that the book derives its name. Samson says she was inspired to write the book, in part, because she too was caught in this sandwich for four years. But while Ivy does form a support group of women in similar situations, these characters remain in the margins, probably to the detriment of the book. It would have been nice to see and know more of them. As it is, the major players are Ivy and her family members. And Mitch, the old flame she considers reigniting in her husband's absence. <br /> <br />Some will find the narrative flow, which often resembles an ongoing dialogue between Ivy and herself, engaging. I found it scattered, an inadequate shortcut to character development. But the topics that CLUB SANDWICH tackles --- adultery, economic strain on marriages, caring for parents and kids, handling adult siblings, etc. --- are especially pertinent to many women today. Figuring out how to be a servant without getting stepped on is tricky, and Samson explores these tensions with compassion and humor. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-03

He then lists qualities a Christian needs to maintain a life of \\"grow[th] in grace and knowledge of\\" Jesus (2 Peter 3:18): information, imagination, persistence, patience, and realism. And these are the faithful qualities that Gary Moon directly or indirectly addresses in this gently provoking guidebook for Christians desiring intimacy with God. <br /> <br />The overriding image of the book is love --- as in \\"falling in.\\" What does it entail? How does it work? How is intimacy maintained over time? The first chapter, \\"The Three Cs of Lasting Love,\\" sets up the three-part outline for the book and the elements of the \\"romantic relationship with God\\": conversation, communion, and consummation. <br /> <br />Moon --- a well-connected and well-positioned Christian counselor whose academic history is never clearly laid out --- is well versed in classical Christian spirituality and spiritual formation that may be \\"standard fare\\" to Catholics attuned to Ignatian or Benedictine spirituality and people committed to 12-step recovery programs but new material for conservative evangelicals. <br /> <br />For starters, the definitions of and exercises regarding prayer center on listening to God as much as or more than on talking at or to God. \\"Silence is the most foundational of all Christian disciplines.\\" The chapter titled \\"Learning to Listen\\" ends with a helpful list of \\"indications of the voice of God.\\" <br /> <br />Part 2 of the book, \\"Communion,\\" focuses on fidelity (willingness versus willfulness), transparency before God (overcoming a fear of total commitment), and the meaning and reality of surrender. \\"Many of us are like the rich young man, unwilling to place our idols in the dumpster. We cannot do it on our own. We need God's help, and often that help comes in the form of pain.\\" We also need the help and accountability of a community of believers.<br /> <br />As I said, this book is written gently --- replete with personal anecdotes and humorous quips; it's clear that Moon is with his readers on this journey --- but Moon, as the saints before him, notes that the intimate relationship with God involves becoming more and more like Christ, who ultimately surrendered his life. <br /> <br />Part 3, \\"Consummation,\\" first addresses the issue of relational forgiveness, including a powerful example of the salvation of a devastated marriage, with Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" being the facilitating counseling tool. Moon then turns to spiritual reconciliation before ending with a discussion of \\"Union with God\\" and what it means. <br /> <br />Each of 10 chapters ends with more-than-cursory study and prayer \\"helps\\": a biblical passage, followed by a short commentary and reflection questions, a meditation exercise, and a spiritual (prayer) exercise. Each of the three book parts ends with a short bio and sample writings of classic spiritual writers: Frank Laubach, a Protestant (conversing with God), Thomas Kelly, a Quaker (communion with God), and Teresa of Avila, a Catholic (union with God). <br /> <br />Moon ends his book with a challenge: \\"Don't settle for brief encounters instead of intimate dialogue; don't become content with a salvation contract instead of enjoying communion; and don't withhold parts of your heart.

His 2003 release, SLOW WAY HOME, was named one of the best novels of the year by two secular newspapers in U.S. cities. LIVE LIKE YOU WERE DYING, a 178-page novella, may well receive similar accolades for the year 2004. <br /> <br />As country music fans might suspect, the book is based on the lyrics from a Tim McGraw hit of the same title, written by Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman. Morris took the lyrics and fashioned a story that seamlessly integrates all the elements of the song --- a grave medical diagnosis, the ensuing quest for adventure, mended relationships, and a reconnection with God. <br /> <br />In Morris's version, Nathan Bishop cheats death in an industrial accident, only to have the resulting x-rays reveal a much more serious problem. Weighing his medical options, Nathan decides it's time that he starts to live as if he were dying. That means, in part, doing risky things he's never done before, like skydiving and riding a bull, both of which are activities mentioned in the lyrics. That also means doing things he never took the time to do, like spending time with his wife and 12-year-old daughter. And finally, it means doing things he never wanted to do, like forgiving his father. <br /> <br />I have to confess that I was fully prepared to dislike this book. I figured that not even Morris could avoid producing a book that seemed contrived, since the content would be forced to fit the lyrics --- and the lyrics of a country song at that. But Morris proved he was more than equal to the task. Nothing about this book felt forced or inauthentic, and there's none of the \\"fluff\\" that I anticipated in a book of this type. <br /> <br />Among the many strengths: Morris's excellent command of the language, realistic dialogue (one of the aspects of quality fiction that too many authors fail to produce), and believable characters. Inthat last category, two of the standouts are Nathan's father and grandmother, two people who easily could have become stereotypes in the hands of a lesser author. Ron Bishop is reserved and remote, the kind of father who has never been able to show his affection. But Morris avoids casting him in a predictable light or overdoing it with a lot of commentary on why he is the way he is. Ron Bishop just is. And that makes him believable. <br /> <br />Grand Vestal, Nathan's grandmother, gets my unofficial award for \\"best portrayal of an elderly woman.\\" If, like me, you've noticed that elderly women in Christian fiction are nothing at all like many of the elderly women in your life, you'll be glad to meet Grand Vestal. Morris apparently recognized the fact that older women are, well, not your father's grandmother. They aren't necessarily the sweet, simpering, saccharine women who call everyone \\"dearie\\" in too many other Christian novels, nor are they necessarily feisty, oddball characters that exist somewhere else along the caricature spectrum. They're real, multidimensional people --- just like everyone else. Amazing that so few writers seem to realize that. Thankfully, Morris does. <br /> <br />My first time through this book, before I knew I would be reviewing it, I made a note to myself on the end flap: \\"Excellent in every way.\\" That assessment still stands.	2005-08-03

I don't remember what inspired me to pick up the book, given that the tagline was \\"How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,\\" but I couldn't put it down. I read it in one all-night sitting, crying my way through the sections that illuminated and explained tension I'd had in specific relationships with family and friends. It was dark outside but light bulbs were going off inside my head all night. <br /> <br />\\"Aha! His primary love language is Acts of Service! No wonder he gets so frustrated when we kids don't help around the house.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Quality time! That's what she values, not my professions of appreciation and friendship.\\" <br /> <br />Based on its applicability to my own life, I immediately determined that Chapman's ideas about there being five love languages were spot-on. And so did about a zillion other people since he has sold approximately that number of books. If you're one of the few people who has no clue what I'm talking about when I say the five love languages, let me explain. <br /> <br />In Chapman's theory, there are five ways in which people express and understand love. These five \\"languages\\" are Acts of Service, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch. Chapman believes that while some people can often express and understand love in any number of these languages, we all have a primary love language through which we are most comfortable expressing and receiving love. He goes on to say that tension in relationships often stems from not understanding the other person's primary love language --- not understanding how the other person is communicating their love and how that person needs to be communicated to in order to understand they are loved. <br /> <br />Though Chapman originally framed his teaching on the love languages in the context of marriage, it quickly became clear that people in all stages of lifewere connecting with the concept of the languages. And over the last several years, he has tailored his message for different groups in books including THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES OF CHILDREN, THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES OF TEENAGERS, THE LOVE LANGUAGES OF GOD, and now, THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES. <br /> <br />The United States has more singles that any other nation in the world except for India and China. Four out of every ten Americans are single, so it makes sense that Chapman would choose to address this large audience. In THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES the core teaching of the original book stays intact but he shapes his message for singles of all stripes --- never married, divorced, widowed, separated, and single parents --- by including anecdotes of the unmarried dealing with various relationship issues. <br /> <br />My one complaint about this book is that the bulk of the anecdotes still seem to revolve around romantic relationships and the looming specter of marriage. A couple of chapters are dedicated to the application of the love languages with roommates, co-workers, family members, etc., but in the chapters that deal with each of the love languages in detail, the illustrations revolve around dating relationships. That's not bad per se, but I would have liked to see more diversity in the types of relationships (i.e. best friends, classmates) that are addressed here. <br /> <br />Having said that, the five love languages themselves continue to ring true in my experience and their adaptation for the single audience is welcome. I highly recommend THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES FOR SINGLES to anyone who would like to improve communication with the people in his or her life. Chapman himself writes: <br /> <br />\\"My desire for the single who reads this book is that you will learn both to receive and find love in all five love languages. I am assuming that those who take time to read a book on love desire to become better persons, to have better relationships, and to reach their potential of leaving a positive impact on the world. It is my sincere belief that learning to speak and understand the five love languages will help you reach that objective.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-08-03

When it's your turn to host a Bible Study group at your house, do you pretend you have the flu? If you're intimidated by the idea of hospitality, look no further than SIMPLE HOSPITALITY for inspiration.    Jane Jarrell rightfully realizes that our problem with offering hospitality usually begins with our overwhelming stresses. Before offering any tips, recipes, or outlines for entertaining, she encourages women to do a \\"heart attack\\" --- a self-evaluation. Jarrell then suggests asking, \\"What do I want to do... be...have...and who do I want to help? Prayer, focusing on obedience, and making priority adjustments are all part of the hospitality package, she believes. \\"We can't give love, share empathy, or offer intimacy to another if we are carrying the weight of the world on our plates,\\" she writes. She rightly observes that until we practice some self-care, we won't have energy or confidence to care for others.    Her book spans the gamut from getting your home ready for company to taking hospitality on the road. Jarrell, a former professional food stylist, really shines in her culinary tips for entertaining. The key here is \\"simple.\\" She hates housecleaning and makes baking easy even for the culinary-challenged. Can you slice refrigerated cookie dough? Unwrap a pack of tortillas? Then you can take some basic steps toward opening your heart and home to others. Most of her recipes use pre-made foods as a base. In \\"The Twelve Doughs of Christmas\\" she uses refrigerated dough or box cookie mix as a starting point, then suggests 12 mix-ins (cranberries, white chocolate chips, red and green cherries, candied orange rind, etc.). Making a culinary gift can be as simple as blending together hot chocolate ingredients in a canning jar and tying a pretty ribbon on the top. My favorite chapter was \\"The Kitchen Magician,\\" in which she shows how the humble tortilla can beadapted 10 ways to create everything from an appetizer to a dessert. Her recipes were mostly simple, cheap, and brand new to this reviewer.    Jarrell sees hospitality as encompassing a broader scope than you might think. In addition to her self-care tips and culinary know-how, she also includes chapters on gardening and decorating. The gardening tips are basic, aimed to help a beginner get started on the yard (avid gardeners won't find a lot of \\"ground-breaking\\" new information here). On the decorating side, there's a good section on creating an inviting entrance, from the front door to the foyer. However, as someone who eschews the country/antique look for a more streamlined ambiance, I found some of her decorating ideas verged on clutter (stacking old trunks to make an end table, for example, or using a grouping of antique teacups as a centerpiece). Probably a matter of personal taste.    What I appreciated more was her correlation between our willingness to be hospitable and our despair over keeping a clean house. An avowed housecleaning avoider, I find myself often passing on entertaining company because of my aversion to picking up the mop. I found her willingness to admit to hating housework refreshing (like Jarrell's husband, my husband is the Mr. Clean of our family --- I had to learn a lot about housework from him). Her tips on making housecleaning less of a chore were funny (\\"get out your can of Pledge, spray it straight into the air, hit the eye-level spots with a paper towel, and you are good to go\\") and mostly practical (the best time to wash a kitchen floor, various ways to use clear ammonia).    Jarrell offers some specific gift ideas for taking hospitality to others, including ideas for \\"Friendship Baskets\\" (a \\"relaxation basket\\" full of gifty bath items, for example). She also includes a special section that offers some quick tips for hospitality during the holidays, a stress-filled time for most of us.    This is a book crammed full of simple ideas on cooking, decorating, gardening, and gift-giving that provide inspiration for showing hospitality. It bears repeated readings as you revamp your lifestyle, your home and garden, and your attitude toward serving others and caring for yourself. You'll also want to keep it handy for when last-minute company is on the way, a new family moves in next door, or your best friend needs a pick-me-up.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

It says, \\"You have been selected for death. Precisely forty-eight hours from the time of this transmission you will die. This is an official death watch notice.\\"    Sydney St. James is a young reporter on KSMJ-TV, channel 2 in Los Angeles. In the opening scenes, Sydney is stuck in a typical traffic jam due to an accident. Later, when assigned to investigate this accident, Sydney presses a local policeman and learns that it is more than a traffic death. It's the seventh sudden death during that particular morning.    As Sydney digs deeper into the story, she discovers this death watch is a worldwide situation where healthy people unexplainably die after their 48-hour notification. The death watch notices have no pattern or consistent target. Beyond the main plot of the death watch, several sub-themes are built into this fascinating novel. Cori Zinn is a jealous, young and ambitious reporter also on the KSMJ-TV staff. At every possible opportunity, Cori tries to turn any attention away from Sydney and toward herself --- whether in a meeting or with a choice assignment. The dynamic creates a realistic inner office rivalry between Cori and Sydney.    Renowned international newscaster Hunz Vonner visits the station and assists Sydney as she tries to unravel the mysterious death watch. The pair, along with a camera crew, set ups close to the 48-hour time limit at healthy 61-year-old Lyle Vandeveer's home. They want to report on the death watch; mysteriously, at exactly the same time, Vandeveer dies on live television.    Sydney discovers a lead as to who's responsible for the death watch from an unusual source --- Reverend Billy Peppers, a street preacher to the homeless. At first her reporter instincts say to ignore this lead. When the death watch becomes personal and connected to her co-workers, Sydney presses beyond her reporter instincts and follows her heart. With her career on the line and her friends facing the death sentence, Sydney makes a leap of faith and discovers an unusual antidote.    While the book is page-turning suspense with a number of twists, ultimately Sydney connects with Rev. Peppers about the reason for the death watch. '\\"Why now?' she asked him.\\"    \\"Billy...folded his arms. 'We're approaching the end of history. It'll be different than what has gone on before. History has always focused on political, economic, and social events. It's time for the spiritual to come to the forefront. Soon spiritual events will overshadow everything else. This is but the first step.'\\"    \\"Massive, worldwide deaths just to get people thinking about spiritual matters?\\"    \\"What is more spiritual than life and death? At birth, the spark of the spiritual animates us; at death, it leaves the body.\\"    A Christy Award winner, Jack Cavanaugh is known for his excellent plots and well-drawn characters in the historical fiction genre with books like PROOF, WHILE MORTALS SLEEP and THE PURITANS. Now, Cavanaugh can attract a new batch of readers with this thought-provoking mystery about sudden death. It could garner some great discussion for a small group, or you could easily spend a couple of evenings engrossed in the drama.       --- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin, (...)	2005-08-03

Brilliant, high-achieving, confident Sandra is an expert in her field, the historical study of textiles. When Sandra's husband Jack passes away after a long illness, though, Sandra finds herself at a loss about how to fill her days --- and her life --- on her own. <br /> <br />Martha McKenzie may be Sandra's polar opposite. About the only the thing the two women have in common is the loss of their husbands; Martha's husband passed away shortly after their marriage many years ago, when Martha was just a teenager. Now Martha leads a quiet, unassuming life, cleaning a local church, living in a small flat, and filling her hours by practicing her art. Martha is a knitter, but not just an ordinary \\"knit a baby blanket for a friend\\" knitter; Martha is a true artist, with an intuitive eye for color, a daring and inventive sense of design, and the skills of a master. <br /> <br />Through a chance meeting, the two women form an unexpected friendship. Sandra admires Martha's quirky ways and her obvious talents; Martha envies Sandra's wealthy lifestyle and enjoys cracking her tough veneer. The two women find common ground when it comes to knitting. Through shared conversations, the two form a plan to mount an exhibition of historically accurate knitted garments, accompanied by text discussing the importance of women's domestic work through the ages. \\"It's something to celebrate,\\" says Sandra, \\"clothes made in love and service, something women have always done.\\" <br /> <br />Sandra, a merely competent knitter at best, commissions Martha to do all the knitting for the exhibit. Martha, a perfectionist with a history of mental instability, finds the task almost impossible. When Sandra realizes that her incessant pressure brings Martha to the verge of a nervous breakdown, she must reevaluate her whole approach to relationships, including her idealized relationship with her late husband. <br /> <br />Although the title of Anne Bartlett's debut novel is KNITTING, knitting is merely one theme in this small, quiet novel. The healing power of women's friendship, the sustaining quality of meaningful work, the gradual process of healing after grief --- all are explored against the backdrop of a simple story about two women forming an unlikely friendship. Bartlett, the wife of a Baptist pastor, also interweaves Christian symbolism throughout the book. <br /> <br />Although Sandra is a prickly character who may repel many readers, and although Martha is portrayed as a little too eccentric to be a realistic companion for Sandra, the novel's general premise rings true, and its lovely descriptions of Martha's knitted masterpieces will appeal to knitters and non-knitters alike. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl	2005-08-03

Right there, you can pretty much assume, before you ever <br />turn a page, that this is going to be a high quality, well-written, well-edited book. And you'd be right. <br /> <br />Part of \\"The Ideals Guide to\\" series, this volume divides the country into nine regions and highlights churches of interest in each of those areas, making it a user-friendly guidebook for road-trippers. If you find yourself in need of an ecclesiastical experience in, say, the Great Lakes region, you can turn to page 183 and find a map showing the locations of six historical churches within a reasonable driving distance. The next few pages describe those churches in varying amounts of detail --- some churches may warrant a full page or more, while others get only a paragraph --- but all have the usual, and vital, information for travelers: location, phone, visitors' hours, admission fee (if any), wheelchair accessibility, and website address. <br /> <br />Like the other three books in the series, which cover Revolutionary War sites, Civil War sites, and presidential homes and libraries, HISTORIC PLACES OF WORSHIP is printed on slick, heavy stock, pretty much guaranteeing that it will hold up to frequent use on a road trip or occasional glances as a coffee-table book. The quality paper also serves as the perfect backdrop for another of Ideals' standard features: absolutely gorgeous photography. <br /> <br />But the real test of any guidebook is in its usefulness, and that's where it's tough for a reviewer to do the reader justice. I suppose I could have asked Faithful Reader for a travel expense account, taken the next six months off, and traveled the country --- which does include Hawaii, you know --- checking out each and every church, all for the greater good of our readers. <br /> <br />Thinking that might not work, I decided to take the book out for a bit of a test drive. So I took it to Tallahassee, Florida, where I unknowingly booked a room in the motel directly across the street from Mission San Luis --- one of the historical churches in the guidebook. Is God good or what? <br /> <br />Anyway, Mission San Luis, as it exists in 2005, turned out to be this wonderful oasis in the middle of Florida's capital city. It's a reconstruction of a Franciscan mission that existed from 1656 to 1704, when it was abandoned by the Apalachee Indians days before an attack by British soldiers and Creek Indians. It turned out to be so much more than the brief listing in the guidebook indicated --- which to me is a good thing. Understatement is always better than hype and makes for so many pleasant and serendipitous experiences. Given the number of churches and amount of information she had to work with, Skarmeas did a great job in providing just enough description to whet your appetite for more. <br /> <br />If you should decide to take this book on the road, feel free to use my highly unscientific and limited \\"test drive\\" as a guideline for what you can expect to get out of it --- more, not less. I doubt you'll be disappointed.	2005-08-03

Media outlets picked up on the public's level of shock that the movie would show 13-year-olds engaged in such behavior. \\"Maybe 16- or 17-year-olds, but surely not kids so young?! And not middle-class white girls!\\" seemed to be the general feeling. <br /> <br />It didn't take long for adolescent psychologists to make the talk show rounds and confirm that this was, indeed, an accurate picture of how many young girls are starting to act out as they enter the teen years. And the movie only confirmed what pastor Charles Stone and his wife had learned the hard way, just a few years earlier, when their oldest daughter, Heather, turned 13. <br /> <br />Today Heather is 22 and a committed Christian pursuing a career in nursing. But for five years she tore herself and her family apart with behavior that the word \\"bad\\" doesn't modify with justice. Emergency rooms, a manual labor camp, mental hospitals, and countless rehab units became the terrain of their lives. In DAUGHTERS GONE WILD, DADS GONE CRAZY, Heather and her father tell their story in a he said/she said format for which a courtroom scene (he said) sets the stage: <br /> <br />\\"A handful of fidgety people sat in the nearly empty room. We took our seats in the back, and after a few moments the bailiff barked his customary, \\"All rise!\\" A dark-haired judge emerged from the side door. He seemed to float to his bench in his ankle-length black robe. I could feel my shoulders begin to tighten as we nervously sat in Courtroom A. <br /> <br />'Charles and Sherryl Stone vs. Heather Stone: Case number 43. Please come forward,' he bellowed. <br /> <br />The bailiff opened the waist-high swinging door that led to the judge's bench. The judge motioned for us to sit at the well-worn Formica covered table in front of him. He peered overhis black-rimmed glasses. 'So what's the problem?' he asked. <br /> <br />With a dry mouth I muttered, 'We just can't handle our oldest daughter anymore. She runs away, stays out all night with boys, uses drugs and alcohol, curses us, and skips school. We've consulted a half-dozen psychologists. We've pled with her, fought with her, and grounded her. We're desperate. We need your help.'\\" <br /> <br />The judge threatened Heather with an ankle monitoring device if she didn't start obeying her parents, but it would take a lot more before she was ready and willing to make changes. No longer opposing litigants, father and daughter want to provide hope, encouragement, and a few hard-earned bits of advice to others facing similar turmoil. DAUGHTERS GONE WILD, DADS GONE CRAZY is divided into eleven chapters, nine of which are devoted to what the duo calls \\"relational life preservers.\\" They include #1 \\"Don't Panic at the First Warning Signs,\\" #5 \\"Reconnect with Gifts from the Heart,\\" and #7 \\"Chose Your Battles --- And Lose Some on Purpose.\\" The first half of each chapter features Charles speaking to dads and the second half features Heather talking to daughters. <br /> <br />This book is what I like to call a teaching memoir. It doesn't shy away from bullet-pointed instruction, but its soul is that of a narrative. And it's in the storytelling that this book is most powerful and instructive. Both father and daughter display a penchant for writing as they relive, in often emotionally raw and painful detail, their conflicts. Charles speaks honestly about the struggle to continue to love his daughter in the face of her vitriol, and Heather speaks candidly about the jabs from fellow students and friends --- incidents adults often overlook as petty in the lives of their children --- that fed her frustration and rebellion. <br /> <br />DAUGHTERS GONE WILD, DADS GONE CRAZY is geared for fathers and daughters, but many of its lessons would well serve any combination of parent/childconflict. In fact, I'd encourage all parents to read this book, regardless of your children's behavior or age. It will make you a better parent and a better support for fellow parents dealing with out-of-control children. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-06-27

And so, when in the first few pages of her latest book encouraging an adventurous outlook on the Christian life, Luci Shaw sets out to prove that she practices what she preaches by recounting the story of her bungee jumping escapade in New Zealand, it falls a bit flat. <br /> <br />I admit it's a bit of a happy jolt to imagine the 70-something Shaw standing excitedly on the edge of that bridge and stepping boldly off. But the scene prompted in my mind broader questions about such pursuits: namely, are we so disconnected from the risks --- emotional, physical, and spiritual --- that naturally imbue life that we must hurl ourselves off bridges to feel brave? <br /> <br />Having just scribbled that query in the margin, I was pleased to find Shaw ask similar questions a few pages later: \\"Though I have always been more than likely to respond enthusiastically to a dare, I feel ambivalent about encouraging anyone else to take a life-threatening risk merely for the sake of thrill, the adrenaline rush, or the satisfaction of personal accomplishment. Risk should not reflect a celebration of foolishness but a freedom from fear. 'Extreme sports,' with increasing levels of difficulty or danger, make for sensational TV programs and stories in sports magazines. But are they simply the result of the impetuosity of youth, a lack of mature judgment, an explosion of hormones or a desperate need for attention? <br /> <br />\\"Was I overly impetuous and foolhardy to jump from that small platform into the hugeness of space? I wondered later which of my friends would congratulate me and which would shake their heads, muttering something under their breath about this woman's 'crazy irresponsibility.' I'd have felt a whole lot more satisfaction if my risk had saved someone's life, or if it had been in the service of God and his kingdom.\\" <br /> <br />It's this ability to question her own ideas and choices that makes Shaw's literary voice (showcased in multiple volumes of poetry and prose) stand out in a crowd. And in THE CRIME OF LIVING CAUTIOUSLY, her voice, more so than the philosophical substance of the writing, is what's fresh and thought-provoking. I wanted to linger on phrases like \\"the Adventure of resurrection,\\" and the poetry sprinkled liberally throughout the book, but I was less enamored with the familiar exhortations to embrace the fearless faithfulness of folks like Abraham, Moses, and Mary. In the parlance of extreme sports aficionados, \\"Been there. Heard that.\\" <br /> <br />Shaw's stated purpose in writing THE CRIME OF LIVING CAUTIOUSLY is to examine the distinctions between fear, faith, and fanaticism. She does this in a meandering fashion that touches on everything from the emptiness of upward mobility for its own sake to the relative merits of flowers versus weeds to the blessedness of goodly dissent. The accompanying stories provide glimpses into Shaw's full and creative life. Fans of her work, and of her regular cohort Madeleine L'Engle, will especially enjoy this aspect of the book. <br /> <br />Bungee jumping might not be as cutting edge as it used to be, but walking through life in faith is just as risky and exhilarating as ever. Those who need to learn that will do well to spend some time with THE CRIME OF LIVING CAUTIOUSLY. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-06-03

You need therapy.\\" <br /> <br />Oops. <br /> <br />I decided to forgo the therapy and instead slow down my WPR (words-per-minute). And it turned out to be the right move as Kent has put together an engaging, down-to-earth collection of stories and advice that just about every woman needs to read. <br /> <br />Kent is in the trenches herself, a writer and busy mom who admits she doesn't have it all figured out when it comes to simplicity. But she's working on it and thinks deceleration has a number of benefits --- physical, emotional, and spiritual. \\"I am writing this book, in part, because I want to learn to live at a saner pace. Why? Because the pace of our lives has profound implications upon the depth of our lives. I don't want to just skim the surface of life; I want to have deep and meaningful relationships with my family, my friends, God. And this I do know: you can't love in a hurry.\\" <br /> <br />With her journalism background shining through, Kent talks with a number of hurried women about what drives them to be so busy. \\"I wondered what motivated them to be so busy and found that they were motivated by many of the same things I was,\\" she writes. \\"I also talked with some women who appear to have found 'a way of life vastly richer and deeper' and I want to know how in this world they did that!\\" <br /> <br />To her credit, Kent offers the stories of women who all are at different places on the journey toward what Thomas Kelly called the \\"deep center of living.\\" She's intent on showing that learning to \\"breathe\\" is a process, not a one-day project. And, as if to further reinforce the idea that you can't hurry up and slow down, she found that those women who have attained a comfortable level of simplicity have all done it in different ways. There are no formulas. <br /> <br />There are some common threads though, three components that make up what Kent calls Sabbath Simplicity --- slowing, simplicity, and Sabbath-keeping. \\"Sabbath Simplicity is not something you add to a crowded life; it's a way of life that you build by listening to God's direction. It's living from the Center in a deliberate but almost effortless way. It's choosing what to say yes to and what to say no to based not on the demands or example of others but on what God is calling you,\\" she explains. <br /> <br />As with most things, this is all easier said than done, and the real take-away value of BREATHE comes from the women who share their stories. Kent is wise enough to know that it's in seeing where the rubber meets the road in their lives that we can see more clearly what something like Sabbath Simplicity would look like in our own lives. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that it doesn't say \\"mother\\" anywhere in the title or subtitle, BREATHE definitely is targeted right at the mom set. Which prompts my only complaint: why limit the scope of this conversation to mothers? I'm not a mother and I learned a lot from these women's lives, but I would have appreciated a few carpool-free anecdotes. Nevertheless, Kent is a talented and insightful writer, and BREATHE is a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-06-03

And to that list we can also add THE SOUL TELLS A STORY by Vinita Hampton Wright.<br /><br />With so much already said about writing, it is no small feat on Wright's part to have added not just an echo, but also new ideas to the conversation. Or rather, she has presented old ideas in a fresh way so as to be, at times, mistaken for new --- the true mark of creativity.<br /><br />\\"Creative formation\\" is the term a friend coined to describe the process of seeking to intentionally shape our creative lives that Wright advocates. The parallel with spiritual formation is no mere accident as she sees creativity and spirituality as inextricably bound.<br /><br />\\"I have become a more spiritual person because I write,\\" she says. \\"The creative process is a spiritual one, and when we receive it as such, it deepens our gifts and edifies us in general. To write true stories, I must encounter truth, and as Jesus said, the truth makes us free. It also brings healing and grace when we attend to it. If I truly open my eyes and express in words what I have seen, then I will have participated in a spiritual act. I receive the vision from beyond myself, and I express it through who I am. This is divinity at work. It may be divinity at its finest, because the whole point of the incarnation was that we understand finally and with clarity who we really are --- made in God's image and possessing gifts with which to express God's very self to the world.\\"<br /><br />Based on this integrated vision for creativity, Wright spends time attending not just to the personal, sometimes esoteric, aspects of the creative calling, but also to the practical, more community-level dynamics often at play in the life of a writer. She acknowledges that sometimes love for those in your life might mean putting aside a novel to mend a broken marriage or care for an elderly parent. She offers tips for seeking out guidance from a mentor or group of engaged friends. She warns of the unique sexual temptations that those alive to the world can face.<br /><br />While THE SOUL TELLS A STORY is aimed at writers, the principles involved would surely translate well for those with other creative pursuits and even the most casual of writers would do well to engage the practices Wright suggests. These include exercises to tap inspiration, to engage both the analytical and creative sides of the brain, and to confront the darkness that can be found in creative work.<br /><br />There are additional, wonderfully practical aspects of THE SOUL TELLS A STORY, but I hesitate to list these components simply because the idea of a list seems to denote \\"formula\\" and to imply there is a formula to the creative life would be antithetical to what Wright is trying to promote. At the same time, she provides structure, the idea that a creative life can be an ordered life, even if not a tightly controlled one.

With the Big Muddy Ranch in southern Oregon as the setting, she presents three separate stories that span one hundred years, from 1897 to 1997. In each story a woman of faith demonstrates unique courage and strength that is rewarded with hope, miracles, redemption and love. <br /> <br />In Part One Eva Cora Thompson Bruner gets her first delighted glimpse of the Big Muddy Ranch when she is merely four years old. Eva's youthful joy is short-lived. Her father kills a man and gets life, and her mother relinquishes hers to despair. Soon Eva finds herself being raised by her aunt and uncle. But her love for them and the Big Muddy grows, and at age 17 she falls in love with D.L. Bruner and becomes his child bride. Yet, once again, her joy is snatched away as Dee is accused of murder and seems destined for the same fate as her father. Eva is determined, however, not to follow the steps of her mother and is blessed with an inner strength that carries her through betrayals and the ordeals of his trial. She demonstrates her faith by setting up a homestead near the Big Muddy and prays for a miracle that will return her husband to her and their baby girl. <br /> <br />Part Two brings Cora Swenson to the Big Muddy. She is the daughter of a woman who had been close friends with Eva's grandmother. The year is now 1984 and the Muddy has been taken over by the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his followers. While purporting to be a mystic sect based on \\"oneness, obedience to the One, and the forsaking of individuality, including earthly goods,\\" it is actually a cult designed by shrewd lawyers to bilk the rich and foolish out of enough money to support the Bhagwan, his 90 Rolls-Royces, and his team of fawning sycophants. Ultimately, a scandal caused by cult members who engineered a bio-terrorist attack ends the Bhagwan's reign, but many of the Sannyasins stay on and await his return, a testimony to the thoroughness of his indoctrination. <br /> <br />For those who remember the headlines during that time, Kirkpatrick provides a grim reminder of life on the Big Muddy under the Bhagwan's leadership. Where sexual freedom always trumped decorum. Where the faithful worked like slaves and their children were left to wander around, attended by all but cared for by no one. It is one of these children, her granddaughter Charity, whom Cora Swenson hopes to rescue from the ranch. <br /> <br />Part Three returns us to the Big Muddy Ranch in 1997 after it has been abandoned by the last of the Sannyasins and is now part of a land parcel that the Washington family wants to donate to Young Life, a non-denominational youth organization that serves teens. The conversion of this rugged, untamed land into a Camp for kids that promises them \\"the best week of your life\\" is both touching and telling as Kirkpatrick deftly parallels the conversion of the Big Muddy with the conversion of a skeptical sociology grad student. When Jill Hartley allows her love for husband Tom to nudge her toward faith, she begins to experience the love and miracles of God. Her questions and doubts are met with kindness and gentleness from those involved in this project of reclamation, and she soon finds herself caught up in the reality of a new life in Christ. <br /> <br />Just as there is a special place in Heaven for those who practice the tenets of God, I believe there is a special place in Hell for those who hurt their fellows in the name of God. Jane Kirkpatrick has an extraordinary talent for compelling us to explore our beliefs while telling a whopping good tale. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding	2005-06-03

Bill Butterworth had a wife of seventeen years, five kids, and a career as a speaker and writer on issues of marriage and family. Divorce definitely knocked the wind out of his life, and he didn't work for six months. As he writes in the opening pages of his book, \\"I lived each day waiting for the phone to ring, hoping my wife would say she wanted to get back together. That phone call never came.\\" While he understands the pain of divorce, this book is focused on helping the reader gain encouragement and hope to get through it. <br /> <br />Butterworth combines pointed storytelling with wise how-to information and a mixture of some Scripture to help the reader take concrete steps forward. At first, he tackles the basics: the need for acceptance from self, the need for healing from God, and the need for help from others. Then he considers the advantage of time, distance and wise counsel combined with valued relationships and tapping into the power of forgiveness. The third section of the book examines some practical matters for many in this situation such as single parenting, getting along with your ex-spouse, and the different type of dating scene. <br /> <br />Butterworth writes with humor as well as vulnerability about his first date with Kathi (who eventually became his wife). \\"I asked her out for dinner that evening. She said, yes, and I was as excited as a schoolboy. I was also dumb as a schoolboy; I had neglected to handle a few key issues surrounding a successful date. Sheepishly I had to call Kathi to resolve my sloppy planning.\\" While Butterworth planned a date, he didn't have transportation since he took a cab from the airport to the hotel. He writes, \\"'So I don't have a car. I was wondering if you would mind driving...' Those last words just seemed to hang out there forever. 'No problem.' She continued to sound sweet... You drive; I'll buy! Was the worst retort I could have used. So, naturally I used it. She laughed. I winced. But God allowed a wonderful evening to take place.\\" On his first date, he even gave Kathi the Myers Briggs Type Indicator personality test. Yes --- really. The date worked out and they've been married ten years. <br /> <br />Anyone in a divorce is in the middle of some huge life changes, and Butterworth tackles these issues in the final section of his book. How do you manage change and the associated fears? He taps the ultimate resource for these situations --- God's power. \\"God's power is in His word, the Bible. For those of us who read these words, the Scriptures are our ultimate source of healing, encouragement and energy. He gives us the power we need to make it day by day as we spend time reading, reflecting and meditating on His truth.\\" Also this final section addresses the often asked question, Where is God? And then, How Do I Get A Second Wind? <br /> <br />While it's been over ten years since I've walked the path of divorce, I found reading Butterworth's advice that those emotions were close to the surface of my emotions. The stories and the practical how-to information touched something deep inside and I could resonate with the truth in these pages. NEW LIFE AFTER DIVORCE is a solid resource to help the many people who are thrust into divorce. You can definitely see the author has walked the walk and talks the talk. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by W. Terry Whalin	2005-06-03

Down to every last detail --- bravo! Standing ovation, even. <br /> <br />God: Do you know that I made you too? <br /> <br />Michelle: Right. Good job. The human body is pretty amazing. And so is mine, well, all except for my hair. It's a little limp, and the color needs some livening up. But other than that --- and my thighs don't look exactly swimsuit-ready. And now that I think about it, you could have improved slightly on my chest. It's not just like everyone else's. Oh, and my skin's too freckly, and there's the matter of my height, and my hips, and my eyes. Actually, God, I have a short performance review I've typed up for you that might help in your future people making. I mean, really great job in general with humanity. But my particular body could have used a better design.\\" <br /> <br />The Michelle half of the equation here is Michelle Graham and the conversation can be found in her book, WANTING TO BE HER: Body Image Secrets Victoria Won't Tell You. If you can relate to her insecurities about her physical appearance --- and really, what woman can't? --- then you'll appreciate this biblically informed look at the basis of a healthy body image. <br /> <br />Few would argue with Graham's proposition that we're more likely to view our bodies through culture-informed glasses rather than through the eyes of God. And the facts of which the culture is informing us --- via airbrushed magazine covers and television shows like \\"The Swan\\" and \\"Extreme Makeover\\" --- often lead us to a pervasive sense that we fall short in the looks department. Why else would we Americans spend $20 billion on cosmetics, $2 billion on hair products, $74 billion on diet foods, and $7.4 million on cosmetic surgery each year? We're obsessed with the way we look. <br /> <br />But it would be too easy just to blame the media. \\"Though a sea of media-promoted beauty surrounds us, it is actually those closest to us who do the most damage,\\" writes Graham. \\"We pass on our body obsessions to each other like a nasty strain of influenza. New research shows that feelings about body image start very early, long before the media play a significant role in girls' lives. A survey at Kenyon College discovered that elementary school girls who were more concerned about body shape and weight were more likely to have mothers who made weight-related comments. The study quoted Ira Sacker (coauthor of DYING TO BE THIN): 'Some of my patients, who are just out of nursery school, tell me that they're fat. Turns out that their moms are saying the same things about themselves.'\\" <br /> <br />Graham combats these negative messages with nuanced commentary from Christian thinkers like Lillian Calles Barger and, more importantly, with Scripture. She advocates a balanced approach to our bodies --- neither denying nor elevating their importance --- that's steeped in the stories in the Bible. If that sounds stodgy, or predictable, it's not. There are no sermons here. Just stories of women, including Graham, who have lived and learned a thing or two about what it means to look in the mirror. Reading this book is like getting good advice from a wise, older sister --- you're a bit surprised you're still listening, but you don't want her to stop talking. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-06-03

In her third saga, APRONS ON A CLOTHESLINE, she continues the enjoyable stories begun in her debut novel, A CAN OF PEAS, and its follow-up, DANDELIONS IN A JELLY JAR. <br /> <br />What's not to like about the characters who populate Lake Emily? Like most small towns, its inhabitants are a hodge-podge of the young and the aging, the slightly bad and the just plain quirky, and the kind and the loveable. As happens in the best novels, you come to care about the characters (who, rather than the plot, keep the pages turning). <br /> <br />Readers of the earlier books will recognize Peter Morgan and his wife Mae, now settled into farming and up nights with a much-loved new baby. Complicating things for the couple is caring for Peter's aged grandmother, Virginia, who suffers a stroke while on an outing to the SPAM Museum, and now battles suicidal depression. Her stalwart group of women friends, the Suzy Q Extension Group, works hard to get Virginia engaged with life again. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Trudy and Bert Biddle tie the knot, and she finds navigating the ins and outs of being a farmer's wife --- and having the demanding Lillian for a mother-in-law --- is more than she bargained for. Further difficulties arise as Trudy finds herself jealous of Mae's preoccupation with the new baby and the demands it places on her sister's life. <br /> <br />Things come to a climax as Lillian and Willie Biddle decide to deed over the farm to Bert, cutting his twin brother Fred out of the family inheritance. Fred shows up on the scene just before things are finalized, with his new Russian wife Svetlana on his arm. As relationships go from frayed to broken within the Biddle family, Trudy takes Svetlana under her wing. As she teaches Svetlana how to driveand coaches her on becoming more independent, it provides some of the best moments in the book. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Virginia slowly comes to terms with her disabilities with the help of a charming elderly widower, August Cleworth. But when her newly protective grown son David returns home to help her recover, her relationship with August becomes problematic. She's also trying to repair things with ten-year-old Jessie Wise, who through a series of misunderstandings feels Virginia doesn't want to see her anymore. Jessie turns to Virginia's physical therapist, Anna Eastman, and soon begins to dream of her becoming the mother she so desperately needs. Jessie's father, however, is still tempted by the bottle, and Jessie's dreams seem a long way from ever coming true. <br /> <br />Readers may find the abundance of plot threads, points of view, and flashbacks to earlier times in the lives of the characters that begin every new chapter a lot to juggle. To her credit, DePree does a good job keeping all the balls in the air. Rather than reading APRONS ON A CLOTHESLINE as a stand-alone novel, most readers will find it beneficial to begin with A CAN OF PEAS followed by DANDELIONS IN A JELLY JAR.

CHANGES OF HEART reflects her skill as well as her keen understanding of relationships --- relationships not only among friends but also between horse and rider. Woven in and through these relationships is a deep belief and faith in God that binds it all together. <br /> <br />Set on a horse ranch in Coldwater, Montana, the story begins with Maggie and Rich Locke preparing for the birth of their young mare's first colt. It is just before Christmas, and excitement is running higher than usual. As Elliston describes the miracle of birth, on that frigid Montana morning, you can almost smell the barn and hear the sounds of life. Joy runs high as Maggie silently prays: \\"My cup runneth over, Lord, Thank you for all this.\\" <br /> <br />But before the week is over, tragedy strikes and Maggie's world is shattered. Her greatest fear is realized when Rich's jet goes down while he is testing a new aviation fuel. Her hopes are crushed like the wreckage of his plane, and instead of leaning on her faith and turning to God, she pulls away, separating herself from His comfort. Indirectly she resents God and blames Him for not answering her prayers for Rich's safety. <br /> <br />Though Maggie feels her life is over, the needs of her horses do not come to a stop, so she continues to care for them and receives some solace from her grueling work. Gradually she begins to allow people into her self-imposed isolation: Dan Pulver, friend and veterinarian, was a frequent visitor who had always admired Maggie and now longs to become closer to her; Dr. Sarah Morrison, whose daughter Tessa desperately wants to learn barrel racing despite her handicap; and Ian Lane, the new pastor whose good humor and eagerness to learn about horses is infectious. <br /> <br />Eventually Maggie realizes that God is healing her broken heart through the people who he has placed in her life. And she begins to understand that her new heart is strong enough to hold love again. <br /> <br />CHANGES OF HEART reminds us of the fragility of life and the grace of God that gets us from point A to point B on any given day. Whether you call it a beach book, Chick Lit, light reading or inspirational, CHANGES OF HEART fits the bill. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding	2005-06-03

But both were able to glue the pieces of their lives back together and move on to healing and wholeness. \\"I found out when you can't go back, you go forward,\\" writes West. <br /> <br />The authors found that divorced women face: <br /> <br /> <br />grief, guilt, anger, hopelessness <br /> <br />stress-related health problems <br /> <br />disappointment with friends, family, church and God <br /> <br />a deep sense of failure, humiliation and rejection <br /> <br />Yet, you will survive, the authors encourage. They urge readers to feel their pain in order to heal; to be willing to grieve the loss of the relationship and dreams. Then, women must embrace the truth about their marriage, and their lives. Finally, they believe, women can move forward to new possibilities and a different future than was planned. <br /> <br />Both West and Quinn offer heartbreaking personal glimpses into their lives spent married to men who were cheating on them. Amazingly, the authors' tone, which easily could be bitter or nasty, remains mostly even-handed (although excruciatingly honest when detailing the cruelty that can happen between spouses). Both authors are vulnerable to the point that Quinn even admits contemplating buying a gun when her hatred against her ex peaked! Prayers of anger and pain are included, penned to God, just as David lamented to the Lord in his Psalms. I want things back the way they were... How am I to endure, O Lord? How am I to get through this?... What did we do to deserve this? Many divorced women will recognize their own questions here.  <br /> <br />While raw emotions such as anger and hatred are acknowledged and validated, readers are encouraged to channel them into positive steps forward. Interactive sections allow for readers to journal their own feelings and ideas. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, the authors offer practical ideas for recovery, ranging from simple things (Rise early and walk before breakfast, write a letter to yourself about your dreams) to some that may seem a bit off-beat (pierce your belly button). But then, off-beat is sometimes the point. Divorced women need to find a new identity apart from their one as wife, and to expand their horizons. West and Quinn offer a thoughtful chapter on navigating the twists and turns of single-parenting. There's also a helpful list of practical \\"housecleaning\\" ideas to let go of your bitterness by letting go or rearranging physical possessions (\\"Get rid of the clothes you wore with him\\" or \\"Take down everything hanging on the walls, freshen the paint, and re-hang pictures differently.\\") <br /> <br />Occasionally, the authors' rah-rah spirit (\\"P.S. You are going to make it!\\") feels over the top, although some will appreciate their unbridled enthusiasm. Others may find some of the practical ideas for moving forward a bit simplistic (\\"...write your name on a seashell or a small rock...place it on your nightstand...remember that persistence pays!\\"). However, the value in even the simplest suggestions offered is that they are easily do-able at a time when even ordinary tasks seem difficult. <br /> <br />An unexpected bonus is the collection of outstanding motivational quotes sprinkled throughout the book, drawn from a diverse cast of characters that includes everyone from G.K. Chesterton to Diane Ackerman; Anne Morrow Lindbergh to Antoine De Saint-Exupry. Although this is a wonderful book for divorced Christian women, it also is highly recommended that pastors, family members, and those in the church read it, and books like it, to gain deeper understanding in how to minister to those in this situation.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-06-03

I never picked it up again. In the twenty-five years since, I have only read a few I could whole-heartedly recommend. The rest drive me crazy. Their messages to women make me feel as though, 'You are not the woman you ought to be --- but if you do the following ten things, you can make the grade.' They are, by and large, soul-killing. But femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula.\\"<br /><br />So begins (or very nearly begins) CAPTIVATING, written by John and Stasi Eldredge. The \\"I\\" in question is Stasi, but it's her husband John you are more likely to be familiar with. He's the author of THE SACRED ROMANCE, WILD AT HEART, and a number of other books that promote an adventurous and cathartic brand of Christianity. Whereas WILD AT HEART tailored that message for men, CAPTIVATING looks to tailor the message for women and is likely to have similar bestselling results.<br /><br />But even though femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula as the introduction says, CAPTIVATING's premise is that there is an essence that God has given to every woman. \\"We share something deep and true, down in our hearts,\\" Stasi writes. And it's this universal feminine heart that CAPTIVATING hopes to expose, heal, develop, and celebrate.<br /><br />That this feminine heart needs healing is not hard for the authors to evidence. \\"Every woman I've ever met feels it --- something deeper than just the sense of failing at what she does. An underlying, gut feeling of failing at who she is. I am not enough and I am too much at the same time. Not pretty enough, not thin enough, not kind enough, not gracious enough, not disciplined enough. But too emotional, too needy, too sensitive, too strong, too opinionated, too messy. The result is Shame, the universal companion of women. It haunts us, nipping at our heels, feeing on our deepest fear that we will end up abandoned and alone,\\" writes Stasi.<br /><br />If that statement doesn't hold water with you, don't even bother picking up this book because it's an observation (and a foundational one for this book) that's only anecdotally supported. If you don't already believe it, this book isn't going to convince you it's true. But if this being both not enough and too much at the same time strikes a chord with you, as it does for me, you'll want to read on.<br /><br />When you do so, you will learn that every woman's heart longs for three things: to be romanced, an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and beauty to unveil. It's worth noting that in WILD AT HEART John Eldredge writes that every man's heart longs for three things as well: a battle to fight, adventure, and a beauty to rescue. Isn't that nice of God to pre-load both male and female hearts with desires that fit nicely in parallel three-point outlines?<br /><br />Snark aside, CAPTIVATING contains some truly moving stories of women, their anguish, and their beautiful blossomings into whole-heartedness. I especially appreciated a section about emotional promiscuity among young single men and women. And as in the books that John authored alone (or with best friend Brent Curtis), CAPTIVATING's imagery is steeped in nature, also something that I personally appreciate. I feel the closest to God under a West Texas night sky where the stars glitter like so many princess-cut diamonds (though admittedly, the site of Chicago's skyline under a full moon as viewed from Lake Shore Drive has been known to do a number on me too).<br /><br />The breathlessly romantic tone of CAPTIVATING will alienate some. But of greater concern to me is that, while Scripture is sprinkled around liberally, the real source material here for making sweeping statements about the needs of women is literature, movies, music, and nostalgia. And while all of these are beautiful landscapes to explore and traverse, given that they often offer potent glimpses of Truth, they aren't necessarily meant to be our spiritual base camps.<br /><br />Having said that, CAPTIVATING surely will be a balm for the souls of many women.

The second chapter, for instance, introduces Scriptures about and classic definitions of gratitude, particularly those of Jonathan Edwards, who distinguished \\"natural gratitude\\" --- for gifts --- from \\"gracious gratitude\\" that \\"gives thanks for who God is.\\" <br /> <br />Other chapters roll out illustrative feature-type, third-person anecdotes, usually based on interviews: Father Jenco, a hostage in Lebanon in the 1980s; Paul Galanti, a POW in North Vietnam; Bob Meyers, a widower who lost a brother at the hands of the Washington sniper in 2002; and the rape recovery of a pseudonymous congressman's wife. <br /> <br />Vaughn lays out a strong gospel message, followed by an extended emphasis on repentance in the context of \\"overcoming obstacles\\" that \\"block us from joyfully thanking God for our own rescue.\\" Then, halfway through the book, she turns to \\"four things that we can do to practice the presence of gratitude,\\" which in turn have a snowball effect, gratitude leading to gratitude. <br /> <br />\\"First, we remember\\" --- our enslavement, our deliverance, our Deliverer; in this context Vaughn vulnerably tells of her struggle with chronic depression and God's deliverance, even if through medication. \\"Second, we forget\\" --- our sins, our shame, our personal successes. \\"Third, we look up to God\\" --- on this point she turns largely to Scripture reflection and a third-person anecdote. \\"Fourth, we look around to His people\\" --- this chapter includes moving accounts of Vaughn's visits with Christians in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br />A final part of the book, \\"Everyday Gratitude,\\" discusses \\"practical things we can do to cultivate a grateful heart.... These hold the keys to the secret of responding to the same old stimuli in new ways...so we experience different results than just life as usual.\\" The \\"things\\" aren't actions as much as awarenesses of various physical objects --- Ebenezer or remembrance stones --- and sensory triggers that remind one of the good. \\"God has designed us so that senses can serve as powerful Ebenezers of His faithfulness, and thereby be triggers of gratitude.\\" <br /> <br />At the end RADICAL GRATITUDE is a reminder that one's positive mindset doesn't have to correlate with positive life circumstances, but rather with our acceptance of grace and our habits of looking for its signs everyday. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence <br />	2005-05-02

Beginning with \\"anemone\\" and moving through her list of 36 wildflowers alphabetically (including a few \\"noxious\\" weeds!), Hedstrom-Page introduces each entry with a short essay. She offers a little lesson in floral anatomy, including the wildflower's coloring, its Latin and common names, plus its medicinal, historic, artistic, or culinary uses. Sketches by artist Kevin Ingram accompany the text.    Some of Hedstrom-Page's descriptions are lovely: \\"The columbine flower is shaped like the head and neck of a dove, and the spurs of the flower look like a quintet of doves bent down to drink at a fountain.\\" On the pond lily, she writes, \\"This aquatic wildflower often adds a yellow ruffle to mountain lakes and marshes.\\" Even those who know a wildflower well will see it through her eyes in a new way.    A section in each chapter called \\"My Wonderings\\" offers a short devotional thought related to the flower (On the viciously deep-rooted bull thistle, she ruminates, \\"Worry can get a choke hold on me...\\"). Occasionally, she overstretches spiritual analogies to make them fit a particular wildflower.    Following the devotional portion is a section, \\"Your Wanderings,\\" in which she tells the reader when and where to find the wildflower, and what to look for. At the end of each essay is a boxed portion, \\"Aftereffects,\\" in which the reader is invited to engage in some activity involving the wildflower. There are craft ideas (weaving with split bear grass leaves) and fun things to do with kids (making dangly earrings from bleeding hearts). Some delicious-sounding recipes are offered, from coffee made from chicory root, fireweed tea, to three dishes involving dandelions. There's even a poem and a gardening tip or two. Several lined pages for \\"reflecting on your growth\\" end the book.    Like any budding naturalist, Hedstrom-Page soon finds that her love affair with wildflowers turns to a bit of an obsession. It's not enough to know the name of the trillium --- she finds naming one wildflower leads to a desire to know its uses and its habitat. Naming things causes her to buy a field guide, and one field guide leads to another...and another, and another, and soon a whole library. A tripod, camera, and close-up lenses begin a photography series. Her affection for her topic is irresistible.    Hedstrom-Page's love for creation is reflected back in gratitude during her quiet times with her creator: \\"I imagined him as a glassblower or cabinetmaker carefully designing each flower, drawing from his eternity of beauty, purity, and knowledge --- divine resources beyond my comprehension,\\" she writes. Wildflowers, she observes, provide a glimpse of God.    One of the few missteps in this beautifully designed book is the informational yet intrusive footnoting. It's also a little confusing that the activities involve picking wildflowers, yet a cautionary note at the end of the book advises readers to think before they pick: \\"Only in the wild do they look their best.\\"    However, this is a delightful book to expand your knowledge of flora, to give to a friend as a gift, or to use with children and grandchildren to open their eyes to the beauty of creation. Even those readers who already love and have a working knowledge of wildflowers will find new information and insights into the wonder of God's handiwork here.  (...)	2005-05-02

Ruth is the author of this collection of memories and her sepia-tinged prose is full of personal stories that create a scrapbook-like profile of her mother that spans Ruth Bell's childhood in China to her current role as family matriarch in North Carolina. <br /> <br />A LEGACY OF LOVE is certainly sentimental, but it hovers above schmaltz by including many of the lessons Ruth Bell taught her children that garnered her such keen admiration in the first place. One gets the sense that Ruth Bell was a woman with a lot on her mind, most of it relating to her faith, and she was eager to pass that faith-filled perspective along to her children. <br /> <br />\\"Mother was sitting with a visitor and me looking out at the patch of lawn in the front of our house and the few sentinel pine trees growing up above the lawn from lower ground. Mother told us that, originally, she and my father had planned to build our home at a lower spot on the mountain, about where those pine trees were standing. In order for the house to have a view, Mother and Daddy would have had to cut those trees down. Daddy was open to doing so, but Mother was not. Apparently, the property's original homesteader had carried the trees as saplings on his back all the way from Mount Mitchell, the highest point east of the Mississippi. Mother could not bear to feel the trees after such a sacrifice. <br /> <br />To solve the problem, Mother explained, she and Daddy simply decided to build the house at a higher point on the mountain. 'I find that to be a good way of solving problems,' she said to us without batting an eye. 'Just move to higher ground.' <br /> <br />It was as if she had pulled a new adage out of thin air!\\" <br /> <br />Ruth goes on to say that such matter-of-fact, didactic moments punctuated her growing-up years with unbelievable frequency. Her mother was able to extrapolate little lessons from life easily and naturally without sacrificing her sense of empathy and compassion. <br /> <br />That Ruth is able to capture her mother's spirit so beautifully is itself a legacy of her mother. Ruth Bell has a well-documented love of writing, and it's a passion she passed down to her namesake. On her 13th birthday Ruth was given a green leather journal with pages edged in gold, \\"a grown-up book\\" in which to record the events of her life. And one suspects it's the discipline of journaling, developed at a young age, that allows her now to recall the days of her life and the lessons of her mother so vividly. <br /> <br />\\"I have found that writing --- particularly journaling --- is much more than chronicling events. As I imagine must be true for Mother, writing helps me clarify my thinking and get perspective on life. I do record events, but then I try to apply Scripture to those events. I ask God to reveal himself to me in the details of my circumstances as I write them out, and I listen for his voice. I may come to my journal with a jumble of disconnected facts and perceptions; but once I am finished writing, I often have a much better understanding of both what has happened and what perspective I need to adopt,\\" writes Ruth. <br /> <br />Along with memories and lessons learned, the pages of A LEGACY OF LOVE are populated with family artifacts and pictures of the Graham clan taken through the years, including some shots of Ruth Bell in China as a young girl. But this is more than just a scrapbook. Given their shared faith and love of journaling, A LEGACY OF LOVE is an especially moving tribute from daughter to mother. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-05-02

Just what was the faith of our founding fathers? John McCollister, a specialist in presidential history and the author of 21 books, sets out to discover just that in GOD AND THE OVAL OFFICE: The Religious Faith of Our 43 Presidents. Through research and interviews, he compiles a succinct spiritual profile of each of our nation's leaders. <br /> <br />McCollister lays out his book in chronological order, from first president George Washington to George W. Bush. Each chapter begins with a black and white photo and a notation on his date of birth and death, birth state, party affiliation, occupation, and religion. Several pages about how a president's faith (or lack of it) affected his time as president follow. The chapter ends with historical highlights of that president's administration. <br /> <br />Readers will discover a few surprises. The denomination of choice for presidents over the years has been Episcopalian (eight) and Presbyterian (six), with eight presidents claiming no affiliation. The first four presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Adams) were either deist or Unitarian. In a time when denominations were distrustful of each other and there was little ecumenical spirit, \\"The essential unity necessary for the survival of this infant nation would have never been realized had an ardent Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, or Dutch Reformed believer been elected as chief executive,\\" writes McCollister. <br /> <br />Even nominal Christian presidents went to God in prayer or read the Bible on a regular basis, he shows. James Madison, who was \\"not a staunch, churchgoing Christian,\\" read books on theology for relaxation, and short-term president William Henry Harrison, who occasionally warmed a pew, still had for 20 years a \\"fixed habit\\" of readingthe Bible. Pragmatist Harry Truman read his family Bible through three times by the age of fourteen. When reading how many presidents experienced the death of several children or their wives, it further explains the need for some sort of spiritual help. And as Lyndon Johnson observed, \\"No man could live in the house where I live, and work at the desk where I work, without needing and seeking the support of earnest and frequent prayer.\\" <br /> <br />There are many interesting snippets of spiritual trivia. Readers will be struck by the nation's fear of Catholicism (John F. Kennedy was our only Roman Catholic president) and the close ties many presidents had with the ministry (Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, and Woodrow Wilson's fathers were all ministers, and James Garfield and Benjamin Harrison were both lay pastors). Dwight Eisenhower founded the Presidential Prayer Breakfast. Lyndon Johnson, who had an overpowering desire to please everyone, attended more different churches than any other president. Jimmy Carter, perhaps our most theologically literate president, taught adult Sunday school. <br /> <br />In one of the longest chapters, McCollister takes issue with some of the over-Christianization of Abraham Lincoln. He notes that Lincoln never joined a church and believed \\"Religion is a private affair between a man and his God.\\" Lincoln's childlike faith has \\"been butchered by those who attempted to turn the man into something he was not,\\" writes McCollister. \\"Consequently, Americans have been robbed of the opportunity to know the rich human side of this man who shaped the future of the Union.\\" Lincoln, he writes, had a simple creed, based on the teachings of the Bible and coupled with an obligation to seek the help of God. McCollister shows that Lincoln was a strong practitioner of private prayer and once said, \\"...I know the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and the nation should be on the Lord's side.\\" Timeless advice! Many reports of Lincoln's Christian faith are unsubstantiated, McCollister writes --- and will remain a mystery. <br /> <br />There's no sentimentality here, no over-spiritualizing. McCollister relies on research and each president's own words, whenever possible, to illustrate his faith. He doesn't gloss over the moral failings of some of our presidents (Grover Cleveland fathered an illegitimate child), although one feels some presidents got off a bit lightly (Bill Clinton's sex scandals are inexplicably passed over). What is surprising in a formulaic book is McCollister's delightfully dry sense of humor, which pops up in unexpected places. This interesting glimpse into the faith of the presidents should earn a place on any history lover's bookshelf as an essential reference book. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

On the piece of paper was a vow that made me part of the-then newly emerging True Love Waits movement: <br /> <br />\\"Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, my friends, my future mate, and my future children to a lifetime of purity including sexual abstinence from this day until the day I enter a biblical marriage relationship.\\" <br /> <br />I hung the card on my bulletin board where it was surrounded by drawings from friends, stickers from my favorite bands (The Cranberries, Pearl Jam, and the Smashing Pumpkins to name a few), movie stubs, and pithy quotes from my favorite books (including the Bible). It was a brag board. \\"Hey, look how cool I am! I have artsy friends and I like alternative music and I'm a Christian at the same time. I'm hardcore. I'm even a virgin.\\" Yes folks, I wore combat boots with my dresses. <br /> <br />Now I'm 27. My music is mainstream (worse yet, I heard Pearl Jam on a classic rock station the other day) and I think the pastel pink purse I'm carrying today officially disqualifies me from anything smacking of hardcore. I still have that True Love Waits card --- I came across it in my parents' basement a couple of years ago --- but my enthusiasm for being a virgin has waned. It's \\"punk rock\\" when you're 15 and marriage and sex is on the horizon, just the other side of college (wa-hoo! College!); it's \\"lite rock\\" when you're 27 and marriage isn't on the radar, much less the horizon, and college is quickly retreating in the rearview mirror (wa-hoo! Paying off school loans!). And frankly, I'm just not ready to be hanging out with Seals and Croft on a regular basis. <br /> <br />And I'm not alone. I can't think of one girlfriend who hasn't struggled with sexual immorality. We've all made compromises to one extent or another. And we're Christian women. Many of us have degrees from bible school, we grew upin church youth groups, we signed True Love Waits cards for goodness sake! <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that \\"just wait\\" becomes a weaker and weaker argument for pre-marital abstinence as one gets older. And a lot of us are getting older before getting married. So, how do you make a compelling case for chastity to adults? <br /> <br />I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br />REAL SEX by Lauren Winner is certainly one way. It offers a theologically grounded understanding of sex and an honest exploration of the merit of chastity when decreed in scripture. And it does so without being glib, sanctimonious, or saying, \\"just wait.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Chastity is not always easy or fun. (Once I was standing in front of my car with my then-beau, E. His arms were wrapped around my waist and I kissed his cheek and said, 'So, I think we're doing pretty well on the chastity front, don't you?' and he allowed that yes, he thought so too, and then he grinned in that way he sometimes has and said, 'Maybe too well.') Which is to say that being chaste is sometimes strange, and difficult, and curious. But it is also a discipline, and like any spiritual discipline, it gets easier and better with time,\\" she writes. <br /> <br />With a pastoral sensibility, Winner puts her own \\"slow conversion to chastity\\" in the context of sociological, historical, and theological trends and interpretations. The result is a new (or very old, depending on how you look at it) schema through which single Christians can view their sexuality and its ramifications not just for themselves, but also for the body of Christ. <br /> <br />This emphasis on community in relation to sexuality is one of the most radical aspects of REAL SEX. Winner suggests that our sexuality is indeed the \\"beeswax\\" of our neighbors. She tells the story of her friend Carrie who was living in a house post-college with six other Christian women. Carrie's boyfriend Thad was living down the street, and even though the two of them were not havingsex, they were doing everything but. And the two spent many nights together. Her roommates had no way of knowing whether or not the two were having sex and no one asked, most likely out of fear of seeming noisy or imprudent. <br /> <br />Winner writes: \\"But the Bible tells us to intrude --- or rather, the Bible tells us that talking to one another about what is really going on in our lives is in fact not an intrusion at all, because what's going on in my life is already your concern; by dint of the baptism that made me your sister, my joys are your joys and my crises are your crises. We are called to speak to one another lovingly, to be sure, and with edifying, rather than gossipy or hurtful, goals. But we are called nonetheless to transform seemingly private matters into communal matters. Of course, premarital sexual behavior is just one of many instances of this larger point. Christians also need to speak courageously and transparently, for example, about the seemingly private matters of Christian marriage --- there would be, I suspect, a lot fewer divorces in the church if married Christians exposed their domestic lives, their fights and tensions and squabbles, to loving wisdom, advice, and sometimes rebuke from their community. Christians might claim less credit card debt if small-group members shared their bank account statements with one another. I suspect that if my best friend had permission to scrutinize my Day-timer, I would inhabit time better. Speaking to one another about our sexual selves is just one (admittedly risky) instance of a larger piece of Christian discipleship: being in community with each other.\\" <br /> <br />In many respects, this emphasis on community makes Winner's call to purity more challenging than the True Love Waits pledge. Just as living under grace does in some ways require more of us than living under the law, so too does thinking about sexuality as a conduit for a relationship require more of us than thinking about sex as a purely personal matter. <br /> <br />But REAL SEX offers this challenge with compassion and generosity. Here Winner manages to be open about her own sexual missteps without wearing them like badges of honor. And in doing so, she provides an example of how to live faithfully with past sin --- learning from it without taking pride in it. <br /> <br />And REAL SEX isn't just for singles. I think one of its most helpful observations is the fact that married sex isn't given its proper due; we define good married sex by how well it approximates unmarried sex. Winners suggests that we should view sex more holistically and realize that if sex was indeed created for marriage, then it was created to be shaped and surrounded by the stuff of marriage --- kids, bills, laundry, etc. The occasional weekend at a bed and breakfast or the romantic dinner by candlelight isn't a bad thing, but it shouldn't necessarily consider those opportunities more important than the connection that can take place on a Tuesday night while the spaghetti sauce is simmering. <br /> <br />REAL SEX offers a compelling example of how all of us --- single or married --- can reframe our thoughts on sex and chastity within a more holistically biblical framework. And it does so in an honest, thoughtful way that I hope will help refresh the larger conversation about chastity and sexual fidelity in Christian circles. I highly recommend it to all. As those wise hip-hop sages, Salt-n-Pepa, once rapped, \\"Let's talk about sex.\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-05-02

The fresco, called \\"The Creation of Adam,\\" depicts God and Adam the moment before their outstretched hands meet. But in the introduction to his book, GOD IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK, John Ortberg points out something that, in my focus on their fingertips, I'd never noticed before. <br /> <br />\\"If you look carefully at the painting, you notice that the figure of God is extended toward the man with great vigor. He twists his body to move it as close to the man as possible. His head is turned toward the man, and his gaze is fixed on him. God's arm is stretched out, his index finger extended straight forward; every muscle is taut.\\" <br /> <br />Ortberg goes on to say that, before Michelangelo, the standard paintings of creation showed God standing on the ground, helping Adam to his feet. But that's not the case here. \\"This God is rushing toward Adam on a cloud, one of the 'chariots of heaven,' propelled by the angels. It is as if even in the midst of the splendor of all creation, God's entire being is wrapped up in his impatient desire to close the gap between himself and this man. He can't wait.\\" <br /> <br />Adam's posture, on the other hand, is more difficult to interpret. His arm is partially extended toward God, but his body reclines in a lazy pose, leaning backward as if he has no interest at all in making a connection. \\"Maybe he assumes that God, having come this far, will close the gap. Maybe he is indifferent to the possibility of touching his creator. Maybe he lacks the strength. All he would have to do is lift a finger.\\" <br /> <br />Like Adam, all we must do to touch God is to lift a finger, and in GOD IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK Ortberg encourages readers to seize the opportunities all around us. \\"God is still in the business of coming down to earth: to this cubicle, this email, this room, this house, this job, this hospital room, this car, this bed, this vacation. Any place can become Bethel, the house of God. Cleveland, maybe. Or the chair you're sitting in as you read these words,\\" he writes. <br /> <br />Ortberg is a megachurch pastor (formerly at Willow Creek and now at Menlo Park Presbyterian) with a knack for distilling sometimes-obtuse spiritual principles into concepts that are easy to digest. Here, he takes the abstract theological concept of God's omnipresence and puts skin on it by teaching readers both how to recognize God in their world and how they can be in a vibrant, moment-by-moment relationship with that present God. <br /> <br />Those two tasks require covering a lot of ground, and GOD IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK is something of a survey of the Christian life. As such, it's an excellent introduction to intentional Christian living, though it might be a little lightweight for readers who already hang with the likes of Dallas Willard (whose work has had a strong influence on Ortberg). Still, it offers a lot of bang for its buck with important insight found on just about every page. Chapter four is especially practical as it provides specific ideas for ways to observe and interact with God throughout the day. Read it with a highlighter close at hand. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-05-02

When she and her husband, Reg, embarked on their careers in gynecology in Australia, they never dreamed their work would eventually take them halfway across the globe to the third world country of Ethiopia to establish a teaching hospital.    Ethiopia's insistence on child-brides and the poor obstetric care in that country is responsible for the high incidence of women who suffer from fistula, a childbirth injury that results in constantly running urine and terrible internal injuries. The personal stories of these women as told by Dr. Hamlin will break readers' hearts. Divorced by their husbands and rejected by their families, many of these injured women live out the remainder of their lives ostracized alone in dark rooms --- all for want of an operation costing only a few hundred dollars.    A simple operation can alleviate their suffering, and most women are curable. (Hamlin takes payment in everything from live chickens to jewelry.) But although two million women suffer from fistula, less than 7,000 are treated each year. The challenges to create a hospital that serves these women --- and then maintain and finance operations --- are formidable.    Hamlin's descriptions will move even the most jaded readers to tears --- and sometimes to a queasy stomach. In one gruesome anecdote, she tells of a woman mauled by a hyena while giving birth (the hyena ate her baby while she was helpless to protect it). However, Hamlin wants us to understand the depth of this despair so difficult to relate to --- the horrific conditions these women live in --- in order to arouse our deepest compassion for their suffering.    In one memorable passage, she describes the life of one such outcast, discovered in a village by a medical worker:    \\"...They reluctantly showed her a side room. Inside it was dark, and the smell was almost unbearable. In the far corner, against the wall was a raised platform. Peering through the gloom they made out a woman lying on her side with her legs drawn up in a flexed position. Her bladder and bowel contents were leaking into a pool underneath. Because she had been in this position for five years the joints had become stiff... and she could no longer walk....\\"    This woman --- like more than 20,000 others --- was cured by Hamlin and her team.    This is a book of contrasts, from the gatherings thrown by royalty to the extreme poverty that most of the people of Ethiopia experience. Although the reader has to mine a bit too much detailed memoir to get to the good storytelling, it is well worth the effort. Her tone throughout is one of gratitude. Hamlin is quick to offer copious amounts of praise for others, even those who have perhaps wronged her in some way. She is vulnerable about her own shortcomings, especially as a parent.    Almost four decades after her work began, it's understandable why Hamlin has been called \\"The new Mother Teresa for our age\\" by the New York Times, and nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. This fascinating account of Dr. Hamlin's work will break your heart --- and offer hope that even the worst circumstances can be changed if we care enough to help. Keep the Kleenex handy.

Lamott, like the best essayists, finds most of her inspiration in the ordinary stuff of living: the exhaustion of parenting, the frustration over a middle-aged body, and despair over the state of the world. In OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS, Lamott gave us a window into her life as a new single mother and her battle to kick her addictions. In TRAVELING MERCIES, she chronicled her spiritual awakening in Christianity.    In PLAN B, Lamott's Sam is a teenager, Sam's birth father is back in the picture (sort of), and she is moving toward a menopausal 50. With all the hormones rocketing around, \\"Sometimes the house gets crowded.\\" Her faith has matured, but she quickly cuts through any notions of super-spirituality. Lamott refuses to put a \\"holiness filter\\" on her prose or her lifestyle; her language leans more toward truck driver than toward Tipper Gore. In an early essay, she writes of a talk she gives at church that receives enthusiastic applause, followed a few hours later by a rip-roaring fight with Sam. \\"It's hard to imagine things can get so ugly so quickly, just because the word \\"homework\\" has come up....\\" Any parent of a teenager will commiserate.    It's these moments when Lamott shares what she calls our \\"ugly common secrets\\" that makes us keep turning the pages, sort of like rubbernecking at an accident site. Her language, while often profane, is also vivid and fresh, whether she's describing a ham she wins unexpectedly at the market as \\"ten pounds of salty pink eraser\\" or the hills behind her house where she walks almost every day, \\"a quiet and holy space.\\"    Some of Lamott's best observations are on prayer. \\"The problem with God - or at any rate, one of the top five most annoying things about God --- is that He... rarely answers right away. It can take days, weeks.\\" She reminds herself that when you pray, \\"you are not starting the conversation from scratch, just remembering to plug back into a conversation that is always in progress.\\" Some days, she refreshingly admits, she hardly knows what to pray. \\"Peace?

After working toward reconciliation, she philosophically concludes, \\"Time, and showing up, turn most messes to compost, and something surprising may grow....\\"    Reconciliation isn't easy, as we see when Lamott reflects on her departed mother. \\"While she was alive, I spent my life like a bitter bell-hop, helping my mother carry around her psychic trunks.... For a while I did not miss her at all, and did not forgive her a thing.\\" Forgiveness, she finds, comes not as a landslide, but rather as small \\"mosaic chips.\\" The ability to do so arrives as a gift: \\"Grace means you're in a different universe from where you had been stuck, when you had absolutely no way to get there on your own.\\"    It's this same grace she claims for herself; \\"God must see me as so many people at once: beloved, nuts, luminous, full of shadow.\\" Whether she is reminiscing about her persona at 48 (the Menopausal Death Crone), participating in a peace march, lamenting the loss of a beloved dog, or nicknaming the jiggly areas on her legs and butt \\"the aunties,\\" we see her as she believes God does --- full of flaws and creativity, insecurity and pride, and rage and love.

Savor it a chapter at a time rather than gulping it down in one long narrative read. Republicans will likely find the continual Bush-bashing offensive and a too-easy device.

According to GO GIRL by Marlee LeDai, the average adventure traveler is a forty-seven-year-old woman who wears a size-twelve dress. LeDai herself has had a bit of adventure. Right out of college she spent two years working her way around the world, during which time she managed to have a number of interesting experiences including swimming with sharks. <br /> <br />Now, with adult children, LeDai continues to indulge her wanderlust and encourages others to do the same. Whether you have the means to take a trip to another country or just to a neighboring county, LeDai's message is clear: \\"Go!\\" <br /> <br />For LeDai, traveling isn't about where you go; it's about what happens to you when you go. \\"Even if you're just up for a hike around the block, this book is written for you. It is not about taking dream vacations. It is not about luxury cruises, whirlwind tours to glamorous cities, or the best hotels. This book is about the adventure that is already within you,\\" she writes. <br /> <br />Brimming with information and inspiration, GO GIRL is part guidebook, part travel journal, and part cheerleader. LeDai weaves together her own adventures with practical tips (Five Big Travel Mistakes to Avoid; Healthy, Cheap Eats on the Road; No-Cost Souvenirs, etc.) and travel stories of women from the Bible, medieval Europe, and modern women who've all hit the road at some point or another. And what makes this book so unique is its emphasis on the distinctly spiritual ramifications of travel. <br /> <br />\\"'I am the door,' Jesus said of his place in people's lives. Then he refers to a going 'in and out' to find pasture. Of his sheep he adds, 'I have come that they may have life more abundantly.' In evangelical terms, salvation is an issue of our eternal destiny, and Jesus is the threshold. In a broad sense, salvation is a matter of God actually inviting us to explore life by passing overthat threshold on a regular basis in order to experience it abundantly. <br /> <br />This exploration is a great adventure in whatever form it takes. It includes our life work, doing what we are gifted for to bless the world. It includes time off to reinvent our inner resources, rejuvenate our inner lives, rebuild our grace. The idea of vacations, based on the original 'holy days' of the church, means to vacate your residence, implying a change of location and routine. Vacations are where people sanctify their workaday lives, engage in physical activities that are fun or challenging, traverse a landscape they're not used to. What will you do with your forty-some hours of vacation? Will it be meaningful, pleasurable, and inspirational too?\\" she asks. <br /> <br />It's hard to argue with LeDai's enthusiasm and experience, and under her influence you might find yourself motivated to put \\"renew (or apply for) passport\\" on your to-do list. But whether you ever leave your backyard or not, GO GIRL will help you see the world in a new way, and therefore become a better traveler. For, as LeDai writes, \\"What is clearly characteristic of people who travel well is the fact that adventure is more a way of seeing than it is an active undertaking.\\" <br /> <br />After a few paragraphs musing practical and spiritual perspectives on feet, LeDai writes, \\"Our feet, clad in protective shoes, are what enable us to participate fully in our own adventures. So let us step beyond the mundane. Grab your hiking boots or strappy sandals --- red or not. Know that something extraordinary will be required of you. Your shoes will get scuffed. Your feet may get blisters and be sore and achy, and surely, tired. But we'll explore our resourcefulness and God's grace even as we gaze upon the wonders of the world.\\" <br /> <br />In a phrase, \\"Go girl!\\" <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-05-02

Drawing from the books of Numbers, Joshua, and the beginning of Judges, Rivers takes us through scriptural events through the eyes of Caleb. The story opens as Caleb, or \\"Kelubai\\" as he is known, is convinced that the God of the Hebrews who is smiting Egypt and Pharaoh with plagues is the true God. Convincing his family to join forces with the Hebrew slaves, they become part of the exodus to the wilderness. There, they wandered for more than 40 years, waiting for God to deliver them to the promised land.    Through Rivers's vivid imagination, we glean new insights into the person of Caleb. He was not fully Hebrew, descended from the line of Esau, she writes. He was a farmer, a slave, who had been born in a mud hut and lived on one small plot of land. She chronicles Caleb's emancipation and the unfolding of his life as a nomad, traveling great distances and assuming the role of soldier. \\"Freedom was not the simple matter he had dreamed,\\" writes Rivers. \\"As a slave, he knew what the day would hold and how to get through it. Now, he didn't know what the next morning would bring.\\"    He was courageous, yet Rivers ably portrays Caleb's conflicting emotions as he pleads with God: \\"I am as afraid as any man to go into Canaan and walk among the giants who live there. But I fear more not being counted among Your people. Do not allow them to set me aside. Please don't reject me, Lord. Purify my blood. Make me a son of Israel!\\"    Children's Sunday school flannelgraph stories tend to gloss over a lot of Old Testament scripture, and Rivers bravely tackles some disturbing aspects of Caleb's story. However, even mature Christians willfind themselves uneasy --- not with Rivers's depiction of Caleb's life, but with the Biblical violence. In the name of the Lord, thousands of men are killed in battle. Endless gore is spilled. Captured kings are tortured to death. Rivers depicts in one scene how every person and animal in a conquered city is put to the sword, including women, children, and babies. Cities are left in ruins. When lives are spared, young virgin girls are given to men as spoils of war. Caleb, in his eighties, is the recipient of two such young girls.    The Israelites' enemies are not the only ones who meet violent ends. In one chapter, 24,000 Israelites are killed in a plague by God after sinning against him with the Midianite women. In another story, an Israelite sins, and he, his wives, his children, and his livestock are all stoned to death. In yet another scene, God opens the earth and two hundred and fifty Levites are francine struck by fire, then swallowed into a precipice when they rebel. And so on, and so on. As a movie, Caleb's story would be lucky to squeak by with an \\"R\\" rating.    Rivers handles the gore and sexual situations with sensitivity, but they will shock the reader nonetheless. However, as C. S. Lewis once admonished Christians, \\"...we must never avert our eyes from those elements in (our religion) which seem puzzling or repellent, for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know.\\"    Rivers is a good storyteller, but the reader may find that, because of the short length of this novella, characters are not as developed as might be desired. Transitions are sometimes missing, and the passion that characterized her series \\"Lineage of Grace\\" is notably absent. Perhaps most disappointing is that the brief study section at the end of the novella fails to address the more disturbing questions raised in a reader's mind: Why would God order so much bloodshed? What was the place of women in this Eastern time period? How does Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament change any of this? Readers may discover that this plunge into an Old Testament story is less entertainment than it is theologically challenging.       --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. (...)	2005-05-02

THE LAST JUDGMENT incorporates all of the elements that made us wish this series would continue indefinitely: mature and likeable characters, topical timeliness, and electrifying courtroom drama, all built on a firm, Biblical foundation of values and truths. Historical detail about the cults and offshoots of ancient religions help put current events into perspective. In addition, Parshall's skilled descriptions deftly transport the reader from the midst of Mideast mayhem to tropical island nations to the Oval Office without ever losing the thread of the story.    Long a champion of lost causes, Will Chambers is called upon to defend a young Christian convert against charges of terrorism. Will had first met Hass-an Gilead Amahn when he was accused of inciting a riot at a Muslim convention. Having successfully defended him against those charges, Will was drawn to the second case against his better judgment and against the pleading of his wife, Fiona, who had just lost her Father and did not want her husband traveling to the Middle East, putting himself in harm's way. But, as a man of God, Will believed he was called to defend Gilead just as Gilead believed he had been called to preach to his former countrymen. When the Dome of the Temple Mount was destroyed, while Gilead preached, the fallout threatened more than the fragile peace talks between Israel and Palestine.    Over the years, Will has gained the loyalty of many who are now more than eager to help him as he faces the most difficult challenge of his career. While not scriptural, you might say that Will is the recipient of some really good karma! Friends like private investigator Tiny Heftland, newsman Jack Hornby, and Special Forces hero Caleb Marlowe are people who we would all like to know and be able to count on if we got into a jam. And Will's old nemesis, Warren Mullburn, is back with another evil scheme designed to increase his wealth and power while dealing a death-blow to Christianity and the Israelis. Mullburn has power that goes beyond his corporate holdings and his island's political sanctuary. He personifies evil with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is rousing good fun to watch our hero take him on in the courtroom and to see him squirm as he is hoisted on his own petard.    Fans of the series will recognize faithful friends and treacherous enemies from previous stories, but the book easily stands alone as an outstanding work of suspense, courtroom drama, and diligent research. Like saying goodbye to an old friend, we hope that we will meet again. If you have never read any of Craig Parshall's books, I recommend you begin with the first in the series, THE RESURRECTION FILE.       --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

Specifically, we need to be aware that our relationships with one another speak volumes to the world. <br /> <br />\\"The early Christians were concerned, and rightly so, about the impressions unbelievers --- 'outsiders' --- might carry away from a visit to their worship service (1 Corinthians 14:23-24). And, among the pastoral qualifications set forth in the New Testament, is this one: 'He must have a good reputation with outsiders,' (1 Timothy 3:7). Jesus Himself said that we are to let our light shine before others so that they can see our good works (Matthew 5:16).\\" <br /> <br />The authors go on to point out that this reality doesn't mean that Christians should alter their convictions in order to curry favor with the world. Still, we should never forget that Jesus does give the world the right to decide whether we are true Christians based upon our observable love for one another. \\"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another,\\" (John 13:35). <br /> <br />This love is what the authors call \\"the mark of Jesus\\" and it's the title of their book. The project is firmly planted in the shadow of theologian and apologist Francis Schaeffer's THE MARK OF THE CHRISTIAN, as it is a conscious update and expansion of the ideas promoted in that book. Schaeffer was concerned, as theologians and lay people alike grappled with the proper preaching and understanding of the gospel in the 20th century, that they not forget the importance of \\"observable love.\\" And it's a reminder that we in the 21st century could use as well. <br /> <br />\\"In a way difficult for us to fathom, how we as Christians relate to one another has a direct bearing upon whether the world will know that Jesus comes from the Father. When this incredibly important point is grasped, we begin torealize that we ignore this neglected 'apologetic' to our great loss. Neither our evangelistic efforts, nor our social action, nor our apologetic efforts will receive God's full blessing if we do not evidence the fruits of the Holy Spirit in our relations with each other as believers. The mark of Jesus in us is crucial and it is compelling.\\" <br /> <br />The book explores what the mark of Jesus might look like in today's world, with chapters dealing with charges of hypocrisy and radicalism in the church, learning to discern what beliefs are primary to the Christian faith and what compromises can be made in good conscience, and the opportunities presented by immigration and multiculturalism. THE MARK OF JESUS covers a lot of territory and could be used as a survey of practical theology in an intro college class. <br /> <br />Less academically oriented readers will appreciate the stories the authors use to illustrate their points, including the conversion of political attack dog Lee Atwater and a moving story of racial reconciliation between a Japanese and Korean student at a conference in Illinois. <br /> <br />\\"It is our contention that when Christians work together for a common Christ-honoring cause, sometimes setting aside their own wishes in favor of others' wishes and esteeming others better than themselves, great good can be accomplished. Egos are harnessed, personal ambitions throttled, wise consensus may be reached, and the body of Christ is strengthened. A watching world begins to see Christians loving each other and is impressed. The unity of the body of Christ is made more visible. Evangelism advances more rapidly in consequence.\\" <br /> <br />THE MARK OF JESUS is an important read for anyone concerned with the advancement of the gospel and with cultivating a more loving approach to relationships. And hopefully, that's everyone. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-04-02

Perhaps with this in mind, Steeple Hill has brought back some of her older romance titles, including the enjoyable GOD'S GIFT. Here, Henderson manages to spin a sweet romance with an intriguing storyline that sidesteps the drippy sentimentality so often found in Christian fiction. <br /> <br />Henderson knows how to hook her readers by creating believable characters who lead interesting lives, and GOD'S GIFT has both ingredients. Thirty-five-year-old James Graham is back in Chicago fresh off six years in the mission field, but not by choice. A bug bite in Africa has left him with a severe, arthritis-like condition that comes and goes, leaving his joints stiff and swollen, and James finds he is unable to continue building clinics for impoverished communities until his body recovers. <br /> <br />The women in Henderson's novels usually have strong personalities and surprising careers, and those in GOD'S GIFT is no exception. Almost immediately, we meet James's mother, Mary, who raises Samoyeds, and the gorgeous Rachel Ashcroft, who owns a brokerage company and is working on her first book. Rachel fuels her intense workaholic lifestyle with grief over the loss of her fianc, with whom she shared ownership of the company. She and her friends, Dave and Lace, have a comfortable, loyal \\"Three Musketeers\\" sort of friendship that will be the envy of every reader. The witty repartee and generous giving between the trio provide some enjoyable, often humorous moments throughout the book. <br /> <br />Soon, the threesome expands its circle to include James, who muses: \\"He'd never experienced anything like it, a camaraderie coupled with loyalty that went so deep as to be nearly unbreakable.\\" A gentle goodness permeates the novel. There are no bad guys with evil intentions, just the battles fought with physical limitations, depression, disappointment, and grief. Few readers will not be able to relate to at least one of the challenges faced by the characters, and be absorbed by how Henderson plots the way they will meet them with faith and courage. <br /> <br />There are a few quirks to Henderson's prose --- she insists on calling women \\"ladies\\" or referring to Rae as \\"the lady\\" to the point that it becomes irksome, and repetition occasionally creeps in. Mostly, however, the story still clips along at a steady pace. The romance that is sparked between the couples is telegraphed from the very first pages, but in Henderson's capable hands, the knowledge of who will end up with whom doesn't lessen the reader's interest in pursuing the story. <br /> <br />And, the story is a good one. James's temporary stay in Chicago lengthens as he continues to relapse into chronic pain, and soon he despairs of ever returning to Africa --- or living a normal life. \\"God, I am so angry at this pain! Why, God? Why me? Why show me a future I would love to have and then cripple me so I can't have it?\\" <br /> <br />However, James is forced to rethink his situation in a surprising twist toward the end of the book, which exemplifies what true love is and what it sometimes will cost. Henderson's characters believe the bad things that happen to them are all part of God's bigger plan for their lives, and James and Rae will come to this realization through heartache, many tears, and the sacrifice of their dreams. <br /> <br />Henderson has matured as a writer since penning GOD'S GIFT, but fans of her \\"Uncommon Heroes\\" and \\"O'Malley\\" series will find this earlier book an enjoyable read, full of Henderson's trademark characters and well-integrated faith themes. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

If the family you have doesn't work, here's an explication of eight \\"transforming habits\\" by which you can improve your relationships through biblically supported principles of family therapy. <br /> <br />Author Beverly Hubble Tauke is a family counselor in Northern Virginia. One of her more interesting credentials is facilitating workshops for homeless adults at a gospel mission, where she sees some of the most destructive effects of --- to use a biblical phrase --- \\"the sins of the fathers\\" being repeated generation after generation. <br /> <br />Scripturally the book's foundational \\"transforming habit\\" --- \\"Explore and resolve wounds from family history\\" --- is rooted in a verse from Nehemiah: \\"They . . . confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers\\" (9:2). Tauke notes, \\"Nehemiah demonstrated how to take a 'moral inventory,' not just of personal life, but of family history, a challenge issued millennia before Alcoholics Anonymous and others discovered the power of this healing strategy.\\" <br /> <br />Another critical chapter illustrates how to \\"minimize the family tyrant's power over you\\" by courageously and lovingly setting boundaries. And another --- \\"Seek one-on-one relationships with each member of your family\\" --- includes a great counseling-session anecdote that shows the value of communicating directly with individuals, not through intermediaries or by garnering support for one's own position against someone else. <br /> <br />Virtually all the anecdotes in SINS OF THE FAMILY illustrate troubled adult relationships, between spouses and among adult siblings and their parents. To complement contemporary family scenarios --- extensive enough to provide solutions as well as set up problems --- Tauke draws her therapeutic points out of life stories of historical and biblical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Katherine Graham, David son of Jesse, and Abigail wife of David. <br /> <br />The best part of the book is its appendix, which gives 15 anecdotal scenarios, each followed by three multiple choice solutions (\\"Which option would you choose?\\") and then Tauke's take on which solution is recommended. Case studies end with a \\"family-functioning issue to consider.\\" A few too many of these \\"issues\\" are phrased in sociological jargon. Case in point: \\"The inevitable mind-relationship linkage assures that moody habits by either marital partner risk both partners and their marital cohesion, while squelching family warmth....\\" <br /> <br />Ultimately the book is about enjoying relational freedom --- not a freedom that comes by running away from home but a freedom that comes from finding the best of your \\"home.\\" One chapter, \\"Activate a Family Freedom Formula,\\" wraps up with a clearly stated recipe: \\"Clarity. Integrity. Courage. Resolve. A bit of sensitivity. That blend of ingredients brought [family members] home again. Home to the other's heart, made safe. Home to the other's mind, made open.

Her latest book, 31 DAYS TOWARD INTIMACY WITH GOD, is a showcase for her ability to connect biblical truth with everyday life. She does so here in an easily accessible format that provides a short essay, a scripture passage, and a prayer for every day of the month. All of it is geared, as the title suggests, to promote a deeper connection with God. <br /> <br />In the introduction, Tada suggests that to be in a close relationship with Christ is to be familiar with suffering. That's not to say that one must go around pursuing pain and humiliation, but it is to say that the cross is a tangible focal point, even a rallying point, for our faith. <br /> <br />\\"Suffering has a way of taking life out of the abstract, out of the theoretical, making it painfully concrete.... When we suffer, we realize we are not handling theological ideas, we are rather being handled by a Person --- the warm and intimate Person of the Lord Jesus. At other times, when life is rosier, we may slide by with knowing about Him. With imitating Him and quoting Him and speaking of Him. But only in the fellowship of suffering will we know Jesus. We identify with Him at the point of His deepest humiliation. The cross, symbol of His greatest suffering, becomes our personal touch point with the Lord of the universe.\\" <br /> <br />If anyone knows about suffering, it's Tada. She was headed to college when a diving accident left her paralyzed from the neck down in 1967. Over the years she has spoken candidly about the ongoing physical and emotional pain her injuries cause her. And it's precisely because of her affliction that she is in a unique place to speak with authority about the ability of suffering to draw one closer to the Lord. <br /> <br />In her daily essays Tada weaves together stories from her life and from Scripture to illustrate how God works through events --- sometimes good, more often bad given that we live in a fallen world --- to draw us closer to Him. She has a gentle, encouraging tone but her guidance isn't superficial. It's steeped in many years as a student of the Bible and the school of hard knocks. <br /> <br />Tada says God is painting a picture with our lives. <br /> <br />\\"There are aspects of your life and character --- good, quality things --- he wants others to notice. So without using blatant tricks or obvious gimmicks, God brings the cool, dark contrast of suffering into your life. That contrast, laid up against the golden character of Christ within you, will draw attention...to Him. <br /> <br />Light against darkness. Beauty against affliction. Joy against sorrow. A sweet, patient spirit against pain and disappointment --- major contrasts that have a way of attracting notice. Your life beings to snap with interest. People notice you out of the corner of their eye --- are drawn to you --- without really understanding why. <br /> <br />They are, in fact, seeing what the Master Artist wants them to observe: Christ in you, highlighted against an opposing force of dark suffering. <br /> <br />He draws you into intimacy with Himself, even in the most difficult, pressure-filled days of your life. Jesus allows you to know Him through the 'fellowship of sharing in his sufferings.'\\" <br /> <br />God is certainly painting just such a compelling picture with Joni Eareckson Tada's life, and in 31 DAYS TOWARD INTIMACY WITH GOD she provides the guidance to help you allow God to do the same in your life. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-04-02

How did a hard-working young peasant girl feel about becoming the mother of God, and later, seeing her firstborn crucified? Prolific author Melody Carlson (ANGELS IN THE SNOW, THE GIFT OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT) pens a first-person account of Mary's life, framed around the events of his death and crucifixion. <br /> <br />Functioning as a broad-brush narration of the well-known story, Carlson uses flashbacks to retell the events of Jesus' life from his conception to his ascension. She starts slowly, gaining strength as the story unfolds. Although the retellings will be comfortingly familiar to many Christian readers, Carlson's real strength comes when she stretches to imagine what Jesus' relationships were like. She does a good job describing the myriad feelings Mary experiences as her relationship with Jesus transforms from mother/son to mother/Lord.  <br /> <br />The transition is portrayed as initially painful. As Mary watches Jesus turn the water to wine in the miracle of Cana, she reflects: <br /> <br />\\"Was I amazed by the incredible miracle my son had performed? Well, of course; who would not be? But the main thing that kept me awake that night was the stinging memory of the way Jesus had looked at me, the way he had called me 'woman' instead of 'Mother.' Almost as if he were dismissing me altogether, as if I was no longer his mother and someone worthy of respect and honor. And that is when I knew --- I knew to the depths of my soul --- something between us had changed. Something was separating us, like an invisible wedge that would go deeper and deeper, slowly driving us apart. And I believe that wedge was the Lord God Almighty. I was not sure why he would do this to me.\\" <br /> <br />As Jesus' ministry develops, Carlson brings the reader back to Mary's life in Nazareth, \\"our unbelieving and insignificant little town.\\" She imagines Mary's treatment by the other women in town --- rejection, shunning. \\"I would walk down to the well, and suddenly I would hear the voices get quieter, followed by hushed whispers and quick sideways glances. I knew what they were saying. And it hurt. Deeply,\\" reflects Mary. <br /> <br />In Carlson's hands, Mary soon becomes an outspoken evangelist for Jesus, a different treatment than other novelists have given her. She travels with the crowds that follow Jesus' ministry, retells his parables to the neighborhood women and children, and is outspoken that her son is also the Son of God. <br /> <br />There are some stumbling blocks. The narration is often flat and devoid of emotion. Mary is a little distant, a little unapproachable. Wordiness makes the pacing drag in places. Occasionally, comparisons don't make sense (\\"My soul is weary as a stone\\" is used twice) or statements feel awkward (\\"...we had a piece of God living in our midst.\\") <br /> <br />Some of the stronger portions of the novella include a freshly conceived scene where Mary watches Jesus with the woman caught in adultery, and reflects, \\"I cannot help but recall a time thirty-three years ago when the woman being shamed could have so easily been me. Now, I was not guilty of adultery or fornication, but to be found pregnant outside of marriage would have made it seem like I was.\\" Readers of THE DA VINCI CODE will appreciate that Carlson addresses the relationship between Mary of Magdala and Jesus (Mary of Magdala may be in love with him, but Jesus loves her only as he loves us all). <br /> <br />Although this narrative lacks the zing of other stories about Mary, such as Francine Rivers's novella, UNAFRAID, readers of Biblical fiction will discover some new insights through Carlson's portrayal of the mother of God. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

She searched the island looking for the congregation that seemed best suited to her theological leanings and preference for worship style. Nice people were also a big plus. She landed at All Angels Episcopal Church on the Upper West Side, despite the fact that she hadn't fancied herself Anglican in the past. It's a great parish, and I'd like to think that the fact that I'd become involved in the Anglican church not long before she departed for Manhattan might have nudged her to check this one out. I would like to think that, but it would be wrong. Because I know the real reason Jenn is at All Angels --- Madeleine L'Engle. <br /> <br />Out on the church shopping circuit, rumor had it that the famed author was a long-time parishioner at All Angels and that fellow congregants often visited her since she didn't get out as much as in her younger days. The thought of whiling away hours chatting with L'Engle was more excitement than Jenn, book lover that she is, could bear. She took up residence in an All Angels pew (well, chair, they don't really have pews) post haste. In the years that followed she became an active member of the congregation, made friends, got confirmed, met her future husband, taught Sunday School, and got married --- all at All Angels. And she has Madeleine L'Engle to thank for all of that, despite the fact that she still has yet to meet the woman. <br /> <br />Such is the power of L'Engle. Trust me, if you'd read her work and had the potential opportunity to spend lazy afternoons in her company, you'd make your decisions on church membership accordingly as well. <br /> <br />Thankfully, the truth of the matter is that you don't have to trust me. L'Engle is nothing if not prolific with over fifty books --- fiction, nonfiction, and poetry --- to her credit. Her latest release is a collection of almost 200 poems, including 18 that have never been published before, and is anexcellent starting place to acquaint or re-acquaint oneself with this potent literary force. <br /> <br />THE ORDERING OF LOVE is a magnum opus of sorts, spanning more than 30 years, from the mid '60s to the late '90s, and it includes everything from unbridled free verse to disciplined sonnets --- all of which tread the well-worn ground of love, faith, and suffering. In her introduction to the book, friend and fellow writer Luci Shaw notes \\"a good poem is layered, does not reveal itself all at once, in one reading.\\" And, indeed, the understanding of these poems develops so much on subsequent readings that the words themselves seem to be ever-changing. One of my favorites is \\"The Birth of Love\\": <br /> <br />To learn to love <br />is to be stripped of all love <br />until you are wholly without love <br />because <br />until you have gone <br />naked and afraid <br />into this cold dark place <br />where all love is taken from you <br />you will not know <br />that you are wholly within love. <br /> <br />In poems like \\"Fire by Fire\\" one gets the distinct sense for L'Engle as an \\"everywoman\\" who writes about life as it happens and has a gift for seeing the whole spectrum of human experience in the seemingly mundane. <br /> <br />My son goes down in the orchard to incinerate <br />Burning the day's trash, the accumulation <br />Of old letters, empty toilet-paper rolls, a paper plate, <br />Marketing lists, discarded manuscript, on occasion <br />Used cartons of bird seed, dog biscuit. The fire <br />Rises and sinks; he stirs the ashes till the flames expire. <br /> <br />Burn, too, old sins, bedraggled virtues, tarnished <br />Dreams, remembered unrealities, the gross <br />Should-haves, would-haves, the unvarnished <br />Errors of the day, burn, burn the loss <br />Of intentions, recurring failures, turn <br />Them all to ash. Incinerate the dross. Burn. Burn. <br /> <br />L'Engle also has a very specific talent for turning the stories of Christianity on their headsand making us look at them in new ways. Her poem \\"Mrs. Noah Speaking\\" presents a perspective on the flood that we don't often hear but that sounds quite familiar. \\"The Ram: Caught in the Bush\\" tells the story of Abraham's almost sacrifice of Isaac from the point of view of the one who would actually go under the knife, conjuring up the image of Christ in the process. <br /> <br />If they ever do meet, I think Jenn and Madeleine L'Engle will get along quite well. Jenn has a knack for endearing herself to somewhat ornery souls and I suspect L'Engle is one, based on her work and the interviews I've read with her. Regardless, she has done her work in Jenn's life merely by living in the space of the written page. Even though Jenn hasn't stopped by at L'Engle's with fresh bagels from Zabar's, she has learned from L'Engle much about life --- the sometimes painful conundrum of faith, the ache of loss, the bliss of love, the assumption of small truths into the Big Truth of redemption --- on afternoons spent with her printed pages. And from a life as a member of All Angels, which she can thank L'Engle for as well. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-04-02

Can the hurts of our childhood be redeemed? Can we ever sacrifice too much? <br /> <br />Charles Martin tackles deep questions like these in his sophomore stand-alone novel, WRAPPED IN RAIN. As he did in his debut novel, THE DEAD DON'T DANCE, Martin masterfully blends lovely prose, interesting characters, well-integrated faith themes, and a moving plot to create a powerful story that will long linger in the mind of the reader after the last page is turned. <br /> <br />In rural Alabama, two abused boys find their only comfort and hope in the 45-year-old childless widow Miss Ella Rain, the only daughter of the son of an Alabama slave. She stands as a solid force between them and their evil, alcoholic, and wealthy father Rex. Beaten bloody by her boss and paid only minimum wage, she sacrifices her own aspirations and dreams to ensure that both Tucker and his half-brother, Matthew (\\"Mutt\\"), know they are loved --- by her and by God. <br /> <br />Despite her best efforts, the boys' relationship with their father leaves terrible scars. Long after Miss Ella has died and Tucker has found fame as an international photographer, his bitterness toward his father makes it nearly impossible for him to lay the ghosts of the past to rest. <br /> <br />Thirty-three-year-old Mutt is now a schizophrenic, obsessive-compulsive paralyzed with fear at the thought of contact with germs, and committed by Tucker into a mental health facility, Spiraling Oaks. Mutt tries to scrub out his past failings by scouring everything around him clean with bleach and Windex --- cars, water towers, houses, his room at Spiraling Oaks. Kudos goes to Martin for his handling of the damaged character of Mutt, who evokes disgust, fear, sympathy, and finally deep compassion. <br /> <br />Tucker and Mutt's lives are about to intersect with their childhood friend Katie, now an abused wife fleeing her husband, and mother of the endearing littleboy Jase. The relationship between Tucker and Katie unfolds sweetly and slowly, in one of the better romantic portrayals in Christian fiction. Wisely, Martin resists the need to tie up all the loose ends of their relationship, which has grown more complicated by the book's end. He leaves it in a strong moment --- with a love on Tucker's part that eerily echoes the sacrificial love of Miss Ella. And indeed, the ghostly voice of Miss Ella, speaking in italics to Tucker, is never too far away. \\"Forgive men and your heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you don't, you're the one who will suffer.\\" <br /> <br />Martin has a lovely way with words, thought sometimes a bit long-winded: \\"South of Jacksonville, the river's waist bulges to three miles wide, sparking little spurs or creeks peopled by barnacled marinas and long-established fish camps where the people are good and most of their stories are as winding as the river.\\" In his hands, even a description of the residents of Spiraling Oaks and their medications reads like poetry: \\"Only a handful were ingesting lithium plus three. These were the lifers. The go-figures. The no-hopers. The why-were-they-borns.\\" <br /> <br />Readers will have a few quibbles. Martin's greatest strength --- his characters --- is also his greatest weakness. He takes delight in drawing them for us, right down to the smallest detail, and the results are often rich, vivid, and compelling. We come to know them intimately --- what motivates them, what their dreams are --- and we care about the outcome of their stories. However, the descriptions of minor characters, such as Missy and Bessie, often get more than their rightful share of page space, right down to the toe rings, which slows the story. In his attempt to portray the evil Rex, Martin overdraws him in a way that strains credibility. Readers also will find an occasional contradiction (the \\"wait time\\" at Clark's seafood restaurant \\"never dipped under an hour,\\" yet later, characters are seated in 20 minutes). <br /> <br />But these are small problems. Martin's tremendous talent is evident throughout, as he shows the power of forgiveness and of sacrifice. The choices to do both are presented as painfully difficult, counter-intuitive --- choices that can only be made with the power of God behind them. And that is the beauty of WRAPPED IN RAIN --- that we can make these choices, with the help of God, if we dare let go of our bitterness, our anger, and our grief over the hurts of the past. This fine novel exemplifies many of the best elements of evangelical Christian fiction. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

In NO HOLDS BARRED: Wrestling with God in Prayer, Mark Roberts (DARE TO BE TRUE, JESUS REVEALED) mines the Psalms for ways to move us from perfunctory prayer to an all-out, nothing-held-back conversation with God. \\"He wants us to come at him with everything we've got,\\" says Roberts. <br /> <br />In each chapter, Roberts explores a different dimension of our communication with God, illustrated from the book of Psalms (asking, remembering, worshiping, thanking, etc.). Exercises are included to apply what is learned from each chapter. <br /> <br />No-holds-barred prayer was initially counter-intuitive for Roberts, who was raised with a traditional Presbyterian example of prayer: Deeply committed prayers? Yes. Gut-wrenching cries for divine help? No. When he tried to discover why he and so many Christians prefer \\"restrained\\" prayer, he discovered: <br /> <br />Most of us are taught to talk to God with retinence. <br /> <br />We don't hear other believers pray with abandon. <br /> <br />We're afraid we'll be penalized by God for telling him what we really think. <br /> <br />We have an incomplete or inaccurate image of God (the angry tyrant, the judge, a faithful sidekick). <br /> <br />Our sin interferes with our ability to pray. <br /> <br />He admits that some of his advice on prayer might seem contradictory, but then, so are the Psalms. For example, in one chapter Roberts emphasizes our need for solitude and stillness (Psalm 46:10, \\"Be still and know that I am God.\\") In the next chapter, Roberts urges us to energetic expression: singing, shouting, raising our hands. \\"If it's in the Bible...I'll do it!\\" He advocates both approaching God's throne boldly, and also offering worship with reverence and awe. \\"God's diverse nature calls forth diverse responses. Our God deserves both intimacy and reverence, both boldness and humility....\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the most insightful chapters dealswith the difficult Psalms of vengeance and hatred. What Christian hasn't stumbled, then quickly skimmed over, Psalms like 58:6-8: <br /> <br />O God, break the teeth in their mouths; <br />tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD! <br />Let them vanish like water that runs away; <br />like grass let them be trodden down and wither. <br />Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime; <br />Like the untimely birth than never sees the sun. <br /> <br />Not exactly first-grade Sunday School material. <br /> <br />However, Roberts doesn't sidestep or offer platitudes about this and other Psalms. \\"...If we believe that the whole Bible is God's holy, inspired Word, then we can't just overlook the parts we don't like. In fact, we probably have the most to learn precisely from those passages we find most distressing,\\" he writes (perhaps paraphrasing C.S. Lewis). <br /> <br />It's Psalms like these that remind us we need to be more honest with God. \\"When we pray who we actually are, vengefulness and all, we stop pretending before God and experience greater transparency before him,\\" writes Roberts. <br /> <br />We also learn to pray in solidarity with those who have experienced injustice, and to pray against God's enemies. We let go of the vengeful desires we have bottled up inside and we open our hearts more fully to God's transforming power, he writes. We all feel hatred, we all desire revenge at some point in our lives. God needs to hear our honest cries from the heart. \\"Pious pretending doesn't fool God, and it keeps us from experiencing his transforming presence,\\" he writes. When we allow God to see into the ugliest corners of our hearts, we are often able to let go of deep, ugly wounds from the past. \\"Let God have your heart, all of it, so that he might heal and transform it.\\" <br /> <br />Some Christians may wish Roberts, senior pastor of Irvine Presbyterian Church and an adjunct professor at Fuller Seminary, would more specifically comment on some of thebenefits of liturgical prayer (although he is clearly a strong advocate of praying in community and, of course, praying the Psalms). Regardless, longtime Christians whose prayer life has gone flat will find Roberts's book an invigorating breath of fresh air, and new Christians will discover solid ideas for implementing the Psalms into their life of prayer. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

In this desperately needed book, Hawkins offers a roadmap for recovery for those who have separated, are reconciling, or divorcing, born of his experiences working with hurting couples. Most importantly, he walks the reader down the difficult road of acknowledging and grieving losses.  <br /> <br />\\"What exactly happens when love unravels?\\" asks Hawkins. \\"Why is it so devastatingly painful?\\"  <br /> <br />Hawkins avoids easy answers. There is no quick fix, no sugarcoating of the pain that will be endured. Marital separation means that spouses will endure a season of grief, of severe loss. \\"You will not be the same again.\\" He doesn't pretend that all marriages will be healed and he refuses to sidestep the fact. Rather, he serves up a healthy portion of compassion, liberally salted with reality.  <br /> <br />\\"As a small consolation, you should know that others have walked this path and survived,\\" writes Hawkins. \\"You join many others who have wrestled with rejection and come away stronger than ever. You and your partner can, with diligence, focus on the problems, find solutions, and create a new life --- perhaps together, possibly not.\\" <br /> <br />Hawkins gives the reader tools to survive the rollercoaster ups and downs of marital separation. Deftly, he weaves together the spiritual with the physical, emotional, and mental ramifications of trying to deal with a broken marriage. One bit of insight: \\"During divorce, 85 percent of your energy goes to emotional coping. The remaining 15 percent goes to the other areas combined. That's why, running low on spiritual energy, you have trouble praying; low on mental energy, you have trouble concentrating; low on physical energy, you feel exhausted.\\"  <br /> <br />As well as proffering his own hard-earned wisdom, he also mines other marital experts for their best material. Laudably, he's not afraid to counsel antidepressants if overwhelming stress causes a biochemical imbalance. He emphasizes healthy boundaries. He discusses how your church may not support your decision to separate or divorce, and why it is important to find an effective support network of faith. And he's frank about the attraction of sex while separated: our need for touch, for affirmation, for someone to tell us we're attractive. \\"Who can blame us for looking for an escape from agony? But ultimately, the only true escape is going through the grief with the Lord by your side.\\" <br /> <br />Rather than rushing the reader to decisions, he emphasizes a time of waiting before action, a time of grieving our losses. \\"Although waiting goes against our natural instincts to scurry about and try to fix everything immediately, we need to allow ourselves time to be still to collect our thoughts,\\" he writes. \\"Look to the Lord and in the quiet hear the loving voice that soothes and comforts.\\" We have to sit with our grief before we can move forward. <br /> <br />His advice is down-to-earth. How do you move beyond anger? He offers concrete suggestions. What friends should I be vulnerable with? What about finances? How do I explain what's happening to my children? How much detail do I give my parents? Hawkins has a lovely way with words, and delivers his practical advice with verve and style. Subheads keep the text organized and specific areas of interest easy to locate. Hawkins's tone is always calm and unhurried.  <br /> <br />Hawkins takes the concrete advice a step beyond just coping, and advises spiritual disciplines as well, such as making time for solitude and journaling. He also peppers his text with scenarios from his counseling practice, which personalizes the advice. <br /> <br />Despite the grief and despair of marital separation and divorce, there is light glimmering in the darkness. All of the difficulties endured will be redeemed, he believes. \\"One day you will know why life's events have occurred as they have,\\" writes Hawkins, adding later, \\"The Lord uses all life experiences, even love lost, to refine our lives. He wants to see his reflection in us. Understanding and accepting this refining process can transform utter agony into a purposeful and rewarding struggle.\\"  <br /> <br />Those dealing with separation, reconciliation, divorce, or those who have a friend or loved one in this situation will find solid, practical advice here. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

Author Terry Hargrave (FINISHING WELL, FAMILIES AND FORGIVENESS) offers competent, concrete, and compassionate help for adult children specifically addressing the spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental ramifications of caregivers and their aging parents. <br /> <br />Hargrave acknowledges that caring for an aging parent can be a wearisome, seemingly thankless task. \\"When we give care to an older person, however, we sacrifice for one who grows weaker, interacts less, and eventually will die,\\" writes Hargrave. \\"It is a service and sacrifice for which we see very little --- maybe even nothing. Caregiving for an older person is purely about servanthood.\\" In providing care for the elderly, we care for our own souls, he believes. <br /> <br />For those whose parents are in the early stages of decline, Hargrave offers a simple chart, the \\"Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Activities of Daily Living\\" that allows adult children to assess how much care the parent requires. Can he cook a meal safely? Is she capable of unassisted walking? Can he take his medications unassisted? <br /> <br />Once it's established that some sort of intervention is required, he explains the four ways an aging parent might respond. There is the \\"make lemonade\\" type who makes caregiving pleasant; the \\"pretend it's not happening\\" type who insists he doesn't need help; the \\"poor pitiful me\\" type who acts helpless to do anything on her own; and the \\"whatever\\" type who is passive and possibly depressed. Hargrave offers suggestions for responding to each type with compassion and firmness. <br /> <br />He points out three areas that must be addressed: Medications, incontinence, and driving, and ideas for sensitively assessing and confronting each issue with the parent. A whole chapter is devoted to housing: Where shouldthe failing parent live? What modifications can be made in the home so the parent can stay independent as long as possible? What are the positives and negatives about hiring a caregiver? What options are available when full-time care becomes necessary? <br /> <br />Another chapter helps the adult child open up conversations about finances, and avoid disagreements and misuse of the family's money by ill-intentioned siblings. His illustrations are firmly grounded in reality --- not all families will agree on how a parent should be cared for, and not all stories end happily-ever-after. However, his practical advice will help a number of readers avoid many of the common conflicts in caregiving. <br /> <br />There's a specific chapter on the warning signs and the implications of caring for elderly parents who have dementia and Alzheimer's. \\"No one can quite describe the pain of having your parent, who has loved you with all of his or her heart, look at you and not have the slightest idea who you are,\\" writes Hargrave, who is a caregiver for his mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer's. \\"It is a slow, excruciating grief, something like pulling off an enormous Band-Aid wrapped around your heart --- but you don't get it yanked off quickly with one sharp pain; rather, it gets pulled off slowly and painfully over many years.\\" <br /> <br />A controversial, but necessary, chapter deals with the inevitable death of the parent. Hargrave discusses such difficult decisions as when to intervene, and when prolonging death becomes its own tragedy. He emphasizes the importance of a living will, and making sure adult children have access to it. He also believes in the importance of helping an elderly parent die well, and shows several scenarios that illustrate what this might look like (giving the parent permission to die, hospice, talking about death and what the parent would like to see happen at the funeral). <br /> <br />You'll want to keep the Kleenex handy as Hargrave shares his own experiences and stories of those families he has counseled when he worked in a personal care facility for the elderly. Each poignant story illustrates factual information, vividly showing what the response to a situation with an elderly parent might look like in \\"real life.\\" Questions for discussion or personal reflection end each chapter. <br /> <br />This helpful book will smooth the way for adults to care for their aging parents with compassionate wisdom. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2005-04-02

And maybe more than that, it's a calling,\\" writes Patricia Raybon in I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE, a memoir on the most familiar yet most mysterious of the spiritual disciplines. <br /> <br />\\"'The highest part of the work entrusted to us, the root and strength of all other work,' [Andrew] Murray declared. Nothing, he insisted, should we study and practice more than the work of praying. And this praying, he said, which at first 'appears so simple,' turns out to be the hardest thing of all, because it's about developing a relationship.\\" <br /> <br />I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE is a real gem. I have rarely read a book that made the intrinsically intangible spiritual practice of prayer something I could wrap my arms around. The writing is both fluid and substantial as Raybon blends her own hard-won insight with that found in classic texts written by lauded theologians including R.A. Torrey, Richard Foster, and Eugene Peterson. <br /> <br />Her journey toward developing an intimate relationship with Christ through prayer starts in mid-life --- when dissatisfaction stemming from a cold marriage, a frustrating mother, and disappointing choices made by her children left her feeling restless. <br /> <br />\\"I was in a standoff with a marriage gone dry, with a life drained empty. But this go-round, instead of pushing back, I would look up to heaven and surrender. Finally now, I vowed to learn, as Richard Foster put it, the real way to pray: <br /> <br />Pray so things healed. <br />Pray so things stopped. <br />Pray so things started. <br />Pray so things changed. <br /> <br />I was desperate, indeed, to learn all of prayer's little secrets, to master all of its hidden methods.\\" <br /> <br />She proceeds to devour books on the subject and reflects on the lessons learned about faith growing up in her family and her church --- both African-American and in the '50s. And she does learn. \\"The more focused on God, in fact, the less I worried about my household's ongoing and never-ending dramas and irritations and problems,\\" she writes. <br /> <br />But this newfound commitment to prayer is tested when Raybon's husband becomes desperately sick to the point of paralysis due to a tangle of malformed veins on his spinal cord near his brain stem. It continues to be tested as their younger daughter, Alana, abandons her family's Christian faith and dabbles in the Nation of Islam before moving on to become an orthodox Muslim. <br /> <br />Raybon presents an interesting-to-read picture of a woman wrestling with her own flaws and those of the people in her life, trying to learn to love. Women from different racial and cultural backgrounds as well as those from different generations than the author (as I am) will recognize themselves in her defeats, victories, and everything that comes in between. That she is able to capture what is universal about the Christian life for women would alone make the book a worthwhile read. <br /> <br />But on top of that, she presents a compelling vision of how prayer can inform and shape life. So often books about prayer are distant and all-too theoretical. As this author tells it, prayer is a well of encouragement, peace, faith, and hope, and those nice ideas take shape through the experiences she shares. I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE strips away our often-childish notions about what prayer is and makes it something vital and, while not easy, possible. The work it takes to dig that well is worth the effort, and Raybon provides the tools (honest lessons from her own experience, Scripture, other authors to read on the topic of prayer, etc.) and the inspiration to help you break ground. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-04-02

It culminates in this compelling inspirational book, THE SIMPLE FAITH OF MISTER ROGERS: Spiritual Insights from the World's Most Beloved Neighbor. <br /> <br />Using the analogy of \\"toast sticks,\\" a treat Rogers cited as a milestone in his childhood, Hollingsworth gathers up the \\"spiritual toast sticks\\" Rogers bequeathed to her --- toast sticks of the heart (inner disciplines), for the eyes (seeing others), and for the hands (using practical things we've learned). She adeptly weaves snippets of her own life throughout, exemplifying the influence Rogers had on her life. <br /> <br />Hollingsworth paints a portrait of a disciplined, contemplative man of deep faith ordained by the United Presbyterian Church as an evangelist with a unique charge to serve children and families through television. And rather than conform to what passed for quality children's programming, he determined to chart his own course. \\"I'm so convinced that the space between the television set and the viewer is holy ground,\\" he told Hollingsworth. <br /> <br />There was no frantic Sesame Street action in \\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\\" Each of the 900 episodes opened with a traffic light flashing in yellow. Slow down, was the message. Take time. \\"And so, for me, being quiet and slow is being myself, and that is my gift,\\" Rogers told Hollingsworth. \\"Sometimes slow is better: in understanding, in learning to be patient, in 'going deeper' spiritually,\\" observes Hollingsworth, a self-confessed Type A, hyperactive person. <br /> <br />Rogers also used the unlikely medium of television to teach about silence. Hollingsworth relates the story of cellist Yo-Yo Ma playing a composition on the show and Rogers telling children: \\"Let's take some quiet time to remember, to sit and think about whatwe've heard.\\" And he did. Silence, Hollingsworth says, wasn't dead air to Rogers --- it was thanking the God who inspires and informs all that is nourishing and good. \\"Fred may have considered silence his most important legacy.\\" <br /> <br />Right next to feelings, that is. Rogers referred to himself as an \\"emotional archaeologist,\\" Hollingsworth writes, wanting to get to the root of what motivates people. As a child, he was overweight and teased by bullies. He wanted someone to tell him it was okay to feel bad. As an adult, he encouraged children to open up about their feelings through setting an example of vulnerability on the show himself. His plea for public television as a venue for teaching about feelings helped him sway the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Communications to come through on a $20 million grant for the medium in 1969. <br /> <br />\\"It's one of the most important parts of the Neighborhood, knowing that feelings are all right. You know, that you don't have to hide them and that there are ways that you can say how you feel that aren't going to hurt you or anybody else. If there were a legacy that I would hope for the Neighborhood passing on, that's certainly one of them.\\" <br /> <br />Rogers, Hollingsworth shows, carefully structured his life. He rose every morning at 5 a.m. for prayer.

Three weeks later his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, and by his 49th birthday a decade of his life had been consumed with the process of her dying and his grieving. It was a mid-life crisis of tragic proportions. <br /> <br />Three years and a day after his wife's death, a first-grade girl was killed while crossing the street just blocks from Hendricks's home. The driver behind the wheel of an SUV, blinded by the sun, ran her over. And two more families, and classmates and teachers and neighbors, entered the \\"house of mourning.\\" The tragedy haunted Hendricks, causing him to ask himself whether he'd learned anything from the experience of his wife's death that would be helpful during such a time. A LIGHT THAT NEVER DIES is his answer. <br /> <br />He navigates between his own calamity and larger, better-known tragedies, examining the connections between all mortals --- the looming and sometimes unexpected specter of death. <br /> <br />\\"So then, what's the connection between the bungled economics of the Great Leap Forward or the massive genocides of the twentieth century, and my wife's death in October of 2000? Simply this: in both cases we're talking about death. But whereas the deaths of people in rice paddies or labor camps are known to me only as sobering statistics and disturbing headlines, Nancy was Nancy. Nancy was a face, and a voice, and a person, and a presence. Nancy was my wife. Nancy was the mother of our three children. Nancy knew my name. Nancy knew the best of me. Nancy knew the worst of me. Nancy knew my heart,\\" he writes. <br /> <br />Hendricks has written a number of excellent books, most of them quite didactic in nature. He certainly is a gifted teacher, and that dynamic comes through in this memoir. It can feel somewhat stiff and outlined, especially in transition from chapter to chapter. But, having said that, there are also sections of this book where the outline fades away and what's left is deeply moving, including the scene that played out in his home when he and Nancy told their daughters that Nancy's cancer had metastasized. <br /> <br />Hendricks has a strong grounding in theology and he, helpfully, puts suffering in a biblical context. He doesn't spiritualize pain away. Instead he digs into passages from Ecclesiastes and explores the Hebrew word \\"hebel,\\" the experience of having one's hopes and expectations dashed to pieces. <br /> <br />\\"I'm all for stopping to smell the roses. But Ecclesiastes reminds us that it's a gift to be able to smell at all. And sometimes there aren't any roses --- at least, none that you can see. Ironically, that's exactly the point at which many people who, like me describe themselves as Christians, have a particularly hard time sticking with reality,\\" he writes. <br /> <br />Above all, this is a book about reality --- about death and pain and suffering. But it's also about the way suffering brings both the best and the worst of life into sharp relief. It's about how God wades into the pain to provide comfort. And it's about how death isn't the final word on life. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-03-02

Allender says we often don't know our own stories because we doubt their existence, dismiss their importance, or we're distracted. <br /> <br />\\"Too many people are missing their story because they're watching the stories of others. We live vicariously through television, sports, magazine, and talk shows. Such stories may occasionally educate us, but most often they sedate us. They free us from admitting that our own life is dull and lifeless. They attract us because they offer life without risk. They are deathly safe.\\" <br /> <br />Fans of John Eldredge's writing, especially THE SACRED ROMANCE, will find similar themes of brokenness, revelation, desire, and narrative redemption here. <br /> <br />\\"Something must awaken us to the fact that we are asleep. And what awakens us is usually a moment of exposure when we see that the conventions that guide our steps and promise us a good life are nothing more than illusions.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The stories told in most families are a kind of propaganda.\\" <br /> <br />\\"You must listen to the heartache and hope that etched in the narrative of your life. And you must find the meaning God has written there.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Your plight is your redemption.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Desire is both our greatest frailty and the mark of our highest beauty.\\" <br /> <br />Allender has a humble and disarming tone that is humorous and relatable. It can be hard at times to wade through the jargon of \\"story\\" --- feasting on story, editing together, writing your destiny ... what does all that mean? But the effort to truly understand what Allender is getting at is worth it. In essence, he's trying to get people to remember. It sounds simple, but it's not given that so many people have a dysfunctional relationship with the past. Whether good or bad, it can be hard to deal with, and so people tend to forget. But by entering into the past, Allender says that we can understand the present and help write our futures. <br /> <br />\\"God is the Potter, and we are the clay. Even the word human --- derived from the Latin word humus, meaning \\"dirt\\" --- shouts loudly about our origin. We are dirt. The name Adam (Hebrew 'adama) means \\"red,\\" the color of clay. God shaped, molded, and formed us to reveal something about himself. He is a Being who loves to reveal and who invites us to join the process of revelation by calling to ask, seek and knock. God always intended for his children to join him in completing creation. We are no inanimate entities that merely reveal glory but living stories that are meant to create glory.\\" <br /> <br />In other words, by seeing and understanding the stories God is telling through our lives, we can be more alive. <br /> <br />TO BE TOLD will provide insight for just about everyone interested in living an intentional Christian life. In addition to his wise observations about life, Allender gets practical in his suggestions for knowing one's story, including fasting, prayer, and of course, writing. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a bit of a memoir-writing fad ensues. And frankly, if Allender is right, we'd be better off for it. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel <br />	2005-03-02

John Wessells reveals nothing about his childhood. And of his youth? One sentence mentions a football scholarship-funding dream destroyed by a knee injury. And we learn that he became a Christian in his mid-twenties. <br /> <br />Rather, in eight anecdotal chapters, the book takes us into the world of John Wessells's therapeutic ministry of music, prayer, and Scripture reading in long-term care facilities for patients with traumatic head injuries --- all severely disabled, some in deep comas. Can they hear him? If so, can they understand his message, of God's love and John's worshipful praise, as he strums a guitar and sings at their bedside? These well-crafted personal stories whisper --- or occasionally shout --- yes, yes. There's even a story of \\"a man who once could not speak but who now says he became a Christian while in a coma,\\" as a result of John's witness. <br /> <br />I don't know when I've read such a helpful and hopeful nonfiction book that does not skirt the hard questions asked by people suffering tragic loss of dreams, such as the woman, introduced late in the book, whose face \\"had the familiar look of a parent whose child has suffered a coma. It's a mixture of bewilderment and desperation.\\" John's very presence seems to engender hope, and ultimately he realizes that might be the point of his ministry: \\"If you just go and sit with these people, it's enough. God can work through that.... <br /> <br />\\"You don't even need to be strong yourself. [God] works through your caring and listening.\\" And singing. <br /> <br />Here is help and hope --- but not without a pointed challenge. \\"Why is it so much easier to care about causes than about people?\\" He relates a telling experience of Christians outside a facility picketing against a parent's legal decision to remove a girl's feeding tube. He later learned that \\"despite all the protesters who had once shown concern for her, no one had ever returned to show similar concern for the other forty or more brain-injured patients who remained there.\\"  <br /> <br />As I read, I wished for more calendar signposts. The account (near the end of the book) of the death, from cancer, of John's four-year-old son in 1994 was the only story grounded by a specific year-date. <br /> <br />The book's title, CONVERSATIONS WITH THE VOICELESS, refers to lessons John has learned from the suffering, sometimes even silent, people he's met, including his son, who seemed uncannily aware of heaven. John Samuel \\"looked forward to a better place --- even while living fully in the place he was in. <br /> <br />\\"I believe that's the hope for all of us who want to listen to the voiceless. Nothing may change in our circumstances, or in the circumstances of those we love. But it is still possible ... to live with eternity in our eyes and hearts.

When I first saw the title of Erwin McManus's latest book, THE BARBARIAN WAY: Unleash the Untamed Faith Within, my first thought was, \\"Gimme me a break! Unleash? Untamed? Barbarian? Is this a spiritual manifesto or the latest physical fitness fad?\\" <br /> <br />The cover didn't do much to alleviate my cynicism. It seems like youngish pastors these days are in a contest to exude as much hip-ness as possible, and McManus, pictured wearing black and standing on the double yellow lines of an urban street at night, looks like he's poised to take the \\"cool\\" trophy. Plus, he calls himself not only a pastor but also a \\"cultural architect.\\" What's up with that?! Is being a pastor not enough for ya? Not cool enough? <br /> <br />I reveal my rather embarrassing lack of generosity to illustrate how far I've come when I say, \\"All hail the cultural architect!\\" <br /> <br />THE BARBARIAN WAY packs a powerful spiritual punch in a small package. Clocking in at 148 pages, the book urges Christians to throw off the yoke of ... Christianity, a polite religion that he says has stultified the true message of Christ and his vision for the lives of his followers. <br /> <br />\\"Somewhere along the way the movement of Jesus Christ became civilized as Christianity,\\" he writes. \\"We created a religion using the name of Jesus Christ and convinced ourselves that God's optimal desire for our lives was to insulate us in a spiritual bubble where we risk nothing, sacrifice nothing, lose nothing, worry about nothing. I wonder how many of us have lost our barbarian way and have become embittered with God, confused in our faith because God doesn't come through the way we think He should.\\" <br /> <br />As you've probably gathered from the title, McManus advocates a more romantic, adventurous, and arguably reckless paradigm for Christian living. He defines the \\"barbarian way\\" as being about love, intimacy, passion and sacrifice. \\"Barbarians love to live and live to love. For themGod is life, and their mission is to reconnect humanity to Him. Their passion is that each of us might live in intimate communication with Him who died for us. The barbarian way is a path of both spirit and truth. The soul of the barbarian is made alive by the presence of Jesus.\\" <br /> <br />But the defining aspect of the barbarian way is really fearlessness. McManus effectively argues that the Christian life is about a lot of things, but it's never about being safe --- emotionally or physically. It's about becoming strong via bold vulnerability, the call of Christ to engage with a dangerous world. It's not an insurance plan. <br /> <br />\\"For years I have made it my mission to destroy the influence of the Christian clich, 'the safest place to be is in the center of the will of God.' God would never choose for us safety at the cost of significance. God created you so that your life would count, not so that you could count the days of your life,\\" he writes. <br /> <br />He goes on to say, \\"When we fear God and God only, we are no longer bound by all of the other fears that would hold us captive. The fear of death, the fear of failure, the fear of rejection, the fear of insignificance --- all of the fears that we know by name and haunt us in the dark of the night become powerless when we know the fear of the Lord. And if this is not enough, we discover that perfect love casts out all fear. Not even God will hold us or control us by fear. When we fear Him, we in essence begin to live a life where we are fearless.\\" <br /> <br />I think this take on the Christian life is especially gripping in this age of fear mongering. Politicians, news outlets, the neighborhood gossip, and even some pastors --- everyone does it. And there are things going on in our communities and in the world with which we do need to be engaged. But not from a position of fear. We need to engage the world with fearless love. <br /> <br />There are aspects of THE BARBARIAN WAY that I would argue, but mainly on points of emphasis rather than substance. For example, the barbarian way seems like \\"the Lone Ranger way\\" for much of the book. When McManus does get around to talking about community, I like what he has to say. But I think it could have used a little more prominence. And the premises of a few of his statements were suspect in my book, no pun intended. But basically, I'm nitpicking. McManus has ignited my spiritual imagination. <br /> <br />And none of this is keeping me from sending this book to my brother and suggesting it to a few other friends, including you. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2005-03-02

To bring about the end of the feud, Anne MacGregor must leave her father's castle in Western Perthshire, Scotland to \\"handfast\\" with the brooding, dark-haired Niall Campbell, \\"Wolf of Cruachan,\\" tanist and successor to the chieftainship. Yet, despite their union, Clan MacGregor (nicknamed \\"Children of the Mist,\\" from which the book gets its title) may be doomed to lose its lands through the treachery of the Campbells. <br /> <br />Barely 18 years old, Anne is already a wonderful healer, skilled with herbs and in midwifery. Her strange gray eyes and remarkable healing abilities spawn uneasy rumors, and some call her the \\"Witch of Glenstrae.\\" Yet Anne looks only to Jesus for help and assistance, and refuses to let rumors keep her from her divinely appointed work. \\"I've a God-given gift to help others. Just because my talents lie in paths different from most women, I cannot serve the Lord by hanging back in fear.\\" <br /> <br />A romantic relationship is the last thing on the mind of the handsome Niall, who still mourns the loss of his wife, also named Anne, and their son in childbirth. But he cares deeply for his clan, and an alliance with the MacGregors seems the best way to bring peace to the land. <br /> <br />The ancient custom of \\"handfasting,\\" a man and woman pledged to each other and living together without marriage, will be new to many readers. Morgan explains that handfasting was socially acceptable at this time in Scotland --- the woman suffered no loss of reputation if it didn't result in marriage. (Handfasting is still practiced today but mostly associated with non-Christian religions.) Anne insists on chastity during the handfasting, which adds sexual tension to the story, as the widowed Niall strives to keep his promise not to take advantage of Anne (which becomes more and more difficult for him as he spends time in her company). While angry at her situation, Anne also finds herself \\"stirred\\" by him.... <br /> <br />Well, you can guess the rest. The way the romance will end is telegraphed to readers from the moment Anne curses Niall in the early pages and muses, \\"even the thought of touching him sickened her, vile, vicious beast that he was...\\" (Isn't it always the man the protagonist hates who she ends up falling desperately in love with?). Although Niall obviously desires her, right up until the end there is the \\"he loves me, he loves me not\\" sort of worries by Anne. No surprises here. <br /> <br />The real suspense comes in discovering who else is working behind the scenes to usurp Niall as leader of the clan. Is it Uncle Duncan, with the cold, steely eyes? Is it Hugh, a cousin of Niall's who everyone believes has gone mad after betrayal by his love, Dora (who is burned at the stake)? Or is it Nelly, the voluptuous serving wench who tempts Niall with her seductiveness? Is it handsome and charming Cousin Iain, who falls in love with Anne and may have designs on becoming chief? Or could it be the harsh clergyman, who is zealous in his persecution of witches? Morgan knows how to spin out the suspense right up until the very end. <br /> <br />Although dialect can be tricky and has been the downfall of more than one good novel set in an exotic historic locale, Morgan uses the Scottish brogue with discretion, enriching the story. There are a few unfortunate moments, such as when Niall compares a man taming Anne's strong spirit with a man taming a spirited filly. It's a tired analogy that crops up in too many romance novels. And occasionally readers will find themselves confronted with unusual Scottish words, such as \\"clarsach,\\" \\"murrain\\" and \\"tanist,\\" some of which can be figured out from their context in the story, while others are a bit more elusive. <br /> <br />However, CHILD OF THE MIST is a smoothly told historical Scottish romance, complete with clan feuds, interesting characters, historical details, and Christian faith versus superstition. It's a promising start to the series. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. Contact Cindy at phrelanzer@aol.com.	2005-03-02

What do you do if you want to lose weight? You eat less and exercise more. \\"The way to get out of debt is much the same --- the only thing that really works is to spend less and save more,\\" Kay says. <br /> <br />Kay joins many other financial experts who write from painful experience. When she and her husband Bob started married life, they had $40,000 in consumer debt. \\"We didn't realize the price we would pay for instant gratification.\\" Through making lifestyle changes, the Kays were debt-free in two-and-a-half years. Sound appealing? Read on. <br /> <br />Each chapter opens with a light personal anecdote from Kay, followed by solid information, often culled from other sources (web site links are given), and quizzes. First up is a financial self-evaluation. Do you use credit card cash advances to pay for living expenses? Work overtime to meet the bills? Buy your groceries on credit? Pay the minimum due on charge cards? You might be financially overweight. <br /> <br />Why are your finances in a mess? Kay suggests looking at your financial heritage --- how your parents handled money. Then, she offers a quick overview of Dr. Kathleen Gurney's nine money personalities and Gail Rose Martinez's five different money styles. After making some personal assessments, Kay waxes philosophical. What is your attitude about money? What are your priorities in life? (Quizzes help you evaluate.) <br /> <br />Next, it's on to the plastic. Do you use credit cards to pay off other credit cards? Do you transfer balances to new cards only to run up balances again? This is a great section with lots of practical ideas and insights about the ins and outs of credit card use. Do you know you have a good chance of waiving the annual fee with your credit card company when it comes up for renewal if you have a good history with that company? Just ask. There is also a terrific list of easy things to do to lower your APR (pay $5 more than the minimum each time, don't apply for other cards, don't max out your limit). <br /> <br />Other chapters tackle saving, sharing your money, and knowing and nurturing your FICO score. Don't know your FICO score? You must learn about FICO, Kay says; it's the credit score that helps lenders make their credit decisions. Married women need to know that their individual FICO score is a different number from their spouse's and know how to improve it, if necessary. There are some interesting tidbits in this section, including the impact of new credit on your FICO score, knowing which loans to secure first (mortgage, car) and how your FICO score can even influence your utility costs. <br /> <br />Kay also has good advice to pass along about communicating with your spouse about finances without fighting, evaluating your insurance needs, finding reputable financial help, paying for college without going broke, and instilling good financial ethics in your children. <br /> <br />The information in THE DEBT DIET lends itself to repeated reading. Even those in good financial shape will benefit from some of the information presented. Between Kay's sound advice and her lists of resources and quoted advice from other experts, readers will come away with practical help for changing the way they handle money. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

But that was over the summer, when Cannes and its environs likely would be crawling with bothersome criminals anyway. It's Christmas now, a time of peace and goodwill toward men, if you don't count the occasional man who turns up decidedly and deliberately dead. <br /> <br />Marie-Christine's holiday adventure begins quietly enough, with her parents and assorted other family members joining her at her Grand-mre's stately home in the Riviera town of Grasse not far from Cannes. Also invited to the celebration is Sister Felicity, a medieval manuscript expert from Scholastica Abbey on Cape Cod who proved instrumental in unraveling the summertime mystery. Given her presumed hotline to the Spirit --- and her memory of the harrowing events just four months earlier --- you might think she would reconsider this trip. But no. Sister Felicity is undaunted by the prospect of spending time once again with the unusual de Medicis and helping to guard a priceless illuminated manuscript that dates back to the 15th century. <br /> <br />You can probably tell where this is going, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the ride. Yes, the manuscript disappears, and yes, a dead body appears. But there seems to be no apparent connection between the body, which belongs to Chrissy's uncle, and the manuscript other than being under the same roof for a time, a roof that belongs, of course, to Grand-mre. And though the apparent victim is a family member, Chrissy's interest in the double mystery goes far beyond the personal. As the long-distance publisher of Grasse's local newspaper, Le Loup Garou, Chrissy has a professional interest in solving the crimes --- namely, a much-needed scoop that could breathe new life into the stagnant paper. <br /> <br />Adding a touch of romantic diversion is the appearance of Claude Bizzard, the Paris police inspector whom Grand-mre had earlier invited to spend Christmas with the family. Presumably, she's well aware that the man makes Chrissy weak in the knees, and equally presumably, she enjoys Chrissy's behavior when he's around more than she would ever admit. Bizzard lends his support to the investigation, which involves a fair amount of religious intrigue added to the theft and murder. <br /> <br />Mary-Jane Deeb handles the intricate plot with her usual skill, though I confess I found some of the background and conversations about the two manuscripts --- did I fail to mention there were two manuscripts? --- to be confusing. But I decided to disregard my confusion and get back to enjoying the story and its many references to culinary delights, taking place in France and all. Yes, Deeb knows her food and describes it well. Expect to salivate a time or two. <br /> <br />A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY IN PROVENCE is an entertaining book that would make a delightful gift for mystery lovers --- as well as readers like me who would buy pretty much anything with \\"Christmas mystery\\" in the title. <br />	2004-12-10

Swindoll has been through a lot of tough stuff. As a pastor, college chancellor, radio host and author, he has experienced firsthand many of the troubles that life has to offer. From \\"Anxiety\\" to \\"Temptation\\" and from \\"Confrontation\\" to \\"Shame,\\" the fourteen topics he covers provide a model for the reader to use when life blindsides him. Thus it is with the authority that comes from experience that Dr. Swindoll generously offers to help those who are struggling with their own particular pile of tough stuff. <br /> <br />GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF explores two basic premises that are built on an underlying theme. First, if you are alive on this planet, you will have problems. The second premise is that God has provided us with the original self-help manual, the Bible. The underlying theme is the adequacy of God's love and grace to see us through even the toughest of stuff. <br /> <br />Dr. Swindoll has the gift of knowledge when it comes to the Bible, and he deftly identifies the roots of our \\"troubles\\" as well as the solutions to them by referencing biblical stories and passages. In each short, focused chapter, even seasoned believers will wonder anew at the omniscience of God. He knew just what kind of problems we would face, how we would try to solve them according to the wisdom of the world, and how sadly we would fail. Then, as Dr. Swindoll demonstrates, God in His loving and benevolent way provided us with the wisdom of the ages if only we would use it --- not only when things get tough but even before they get tough. <br /> <br />Often, when people have problems, they feel guilty and shamed or angry and resentful. But the problems themselves have been around since the beginning of time. And, more importantly, Jesus Himself experienced them. So when the Word of God offers answers, it can be trusted because the Word Himself did what His Father told Him to do...and it worked. We cannot be exactly like Jesus because, though He was tempted, He neversinned; often our problems are compounded because we do sin. Yet, through God's grace, the same solutions are available to us, and if we truly repent, we won't have to go through the same tough stuff again. <br /> <br />GETTING THROUGH THE TOUGH STUFF is not a simple \\"take two verses and call me in the morning\\" book of platitudes. It provides biblical answers to contemporary problems in a loving and gentle way. Charles Swindoll is a man after God's own heart. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

Larimore paints an enjoyable yet realistic portrait of Bryson City, with all of its inviting warmth and disappointing warts. <br /> <br />Unexpected tragedies --- such as a man whose head is crushed by a tree, a first encounter with the death of an AIDS patient, and concern over a baby born with Down Syndrome --- all give Larimore opportunities to reflect on God as the director of \\"a great production.\\" For Larimore, even his daughter Kate's cerebral palsy is a gift from God, who \\"knew exactly what he was doing.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Even though I wasn't sure of all the whys and all the reasons for the many events in my life and my patients' lives that sometimes seemed haphazard or random, I knew there was One who did,\\" Larimore writes. While some Christian readers will not adhere to Larimore's particular theology about evil and suffering, they should find his reminders of the confidence we can have in God's love and care for us compelling and reassuring. <br /> <br />But to implythat this is heavy reading would be a misnomer. The necessary darker side that writing about a medical practice necessitates is leavened throughout with Larimore's lighter reminiscences, including the hilarious recounting of his involvement in the Miss Flame contest. The readers see a different side of the doctor as he dons an overstuffed bra and midnight blue sequined evening gown, complete with blond wig and high heels to compete in the contest (and later sports a shiny red one-piece swimsuit). Other lighter moments include a \\"secret\\" recipe for barbecue sauce given to the reader, complete with a short recounted history of the condiment. <br /> <br />Occasionally, the text becomes a bit dialogue-heavy as Larimore relies on conversations to carry the stories. Larimore is also apt to fall into an instructional tone (\\"Researchers have now found that loneliness and anger are two of the leading causes of death. Even in the 1980s, an increasing number of well-designed studies...\\") and can't resist the occasional statistic or elaborating on a medical case. Some readers will enjoy these medical asides, while others may find that they slow down the pacing of the stories. Larimore ends his book with some hints at new troubles down the road and the potential of a new practice, which will keep his fans anticipating the next installment. <br /> <br />Those readers who enjoy Philip Gulley's \\"Front Porch\\" series or James Herriot's veterinary tales will embrace this Christian doctor's latest homespun reflections on his life and medical practice in a small town. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby (phrelanzer@aol.com) <br /> <br />	2004-12-10

But why has the perpetrator gone after her friends, and not the mayor herself? As the attractive (and single) detective Judson West tells her, \\"My guess is, they want something from you.\\" Soon, she is riddled by guilt: \\"I was feeling like the reincarnation of Typhoid Mary,\\" muses Maddy. As the story unfolds, any association with the mayor seems to be an invitation to murder, assault, or abduction. <br /> <br />Unable to know whom to trust, the attractive widow takes in Celeste Truccoli, the 19-year-old daughter of one of her friends who has disappeared. When it soon becomes apparent that anyone she loves is in danger, Maddy's mother and father also move in, and Gansky paints them both as engaging, loveable parents. Back at the office, Randi Portman, Maddy's able personal assistant, keeps things running smoothly while pushing the Mayor to up the ante and run for Congresswoman at the next election. When Celeste's estranged father jets in for reasons never fully explained and begins having Maddy and Celeste followed, chaos ensues. Dr. Jerry Thomas, a middle-aged divorcee who has known Maddy for years, adds another dollop of possible romantic intrigue to the tale. <br /> <br />Gansky does a good job writing in first person as a woman, and is adept at laying many false rabbit trails for the reader to follow. He also writes some nice descriptions of the beautiful southern California landscape where the story unfolds (although he has a fondness for the word \\"azure\\"). He occasionally overdescribes (flames in a fireplace \\"dance like leprechauns on St. Paddy's day\\" and tears \\"broke through like Huns attacking a village\\"). He sometimes falls back on the overused novelist's device of describing his characters appearance as they see themselves reflected in a window or a mirror. Gansky also occasionally \\"tells\\" rather than \\"shows\\" (\\"The pier is a place of constant activity...\\"). He also makes many of his sentences the same length, rather than varying the length for the enjoyment of the reader. Readers may also find themselves confused when the plot ending revolves around a fire ant bite that seemingly happens on a boat at sea (or happens at a location where there is a security camera close by). <br /> <br />Yet all of these are blips in what is a genuinely enjoyable suspense novel. Gansky knows how to keep his readers guessing, and the device of the blood drops he uses to frame his story around will have a chilling effect on the reader. Although some conversion scenes feel a little heavy-handed rather than flowing seamlessly into the story, the redemptive conclusion of the novel has some nice twists and surprises. This fast-paced tale of intrigue in a small southern California coastal town is an enjoyable one for faith fiction fans. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby (phrelanzer@aol.com)	2004-12-10

Margos has launched an engrossing series with her debut novel, SHATTERED IMAGE. In this initial outing we are introduced to forensic sculptor Toni Sullivan and her co-workers who protect and serve in the Austin, Texas area. Not only does the author weave a complex tale that spans several decades, she also educates the reader in the art of forensic sculpting. This fascinating science enables victims to be identified long after there is nothing left of them but their bones. Once the sculptor completes her work, a face emerges and photographs of that face are broadcast in the hopes that someone will recognize it. After identification is made, cold case specialists can begin searching for the cause of death, and those who caused the death. <br /> <br />Toni Sullivan is a former nurse who served in Vietnam and still suffers from memories seared into her spirit by that horrific war. In addition, she has lost her beloved husband and finds herself too often drifting toward the company of the dead rather than of the living, immersing herself in her work and exhausting herself to ease her pain. Fortunately, Toni is surrounded by friends and relatives who genuinely like her and respect her work. There is her son Mike, a homicide detective, her spry 83-year-old dad who still fixes cars for friends, Lt. Drew Smith of the Texas Rangers, and a host of others who cooperate with her to solve the crimes at hand. <br /> <br />While working to identify two separate sets of bones that were long dead but recently buried, Toni receives a call from her old friend, Irini Nikolaides, whose husband Ted served with Toni in Vietnam and who has been MIA all these years. Some bones have been found, including the skull, which Irini wants Toni to \\"bring back\\" in the hope that it will provide closure for her thirty years of uncertainty and grief. Unable to refuse her friend, Toni relies on God, through the power of prayer, to prepare her for the task. These spiritual and psychological dilemmasmay stimulate the reader to affirm his own thoughts and beliefs about the process of healing. <br /> <br />SHATTERED IMAGE is the first in a series that promises to provide exciting and elucidating stories without the profanity and corrosiveness found in so many of today's popular works. J.F. Margos has gathered a competent and likeable ensemble, and we look forward to getting to know them better. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

We are all created with a certain \\"relationship DNA code . . . made up of three simple yet profound strands: 1. You are made for relationships. 2. You are made with the capacity to choose. 3. You are made to take responsibility for yourself.\\" <br /> <br />But the book quickly moves to a different metaphor, of a relational dance in which one's steps or moves are predicated by one's fears. The anecdote introducing this metaphor is about husband and wife \\"Dan and Celeste.\\" Precariously unemployed Dan has just received an out-of-state job offer, but Celeste vehemently resists moving away from her friends and extended family. The \\"surface problem\\" or conflict is about whether they stay or go. But \\"the external problem is rarely the real problem.\\" Rather, conflicts are usually rooted in core fears: for women, usually some variation of fear of disconnection; for men, \\"of helplessness or feeling controlled.\\" <br /> <br />The rest of the book explains how to \\"break the rhythm of the Fear Dance\\" by taking responsibility for oneself and learning \\"new dance steps.\\" Though the strategies apply to any close relationship, the major intent is improving marital dynamics. <br /> <br />Like Smalley's previous books, THE DNA OF RELATIONSHIPS is engaging, largely because he sprinkles his teaching points with anecdotes in which he presents himself as the jerk who has taken years to learn lessons he wants to pass along; the \\"relationship expert\\" is just a regular guy. His style is also evident in this book's clear outline; for example, chapter 4, \\"The Power of One: Take Personal Responsibility\\" includes \\"six steps to take control of your emotions and reactions to life.\\" For extra measure, each chapter ends with a one-page \\"One-Minute Review\\" of the major points. <br /> <br />An appendix titled \\"Identify Your Core Fear\\" contains a six-part questionnaire, helpful to anyone looking for insight into how and why a particular person gets under your skin.

(Lest you forget, his name unnecessarily is printed at the top of every left page.) But the title page lists three co-authors: his two sons, Greg and Michael, and Robert Paul, \\"who developed much of the original concepts.\\" In working with these men --- what they call the \\"Relationship Revolution Team\\" --- Gary looks to the future, challenging the younger generation to catch the vision to reverse the distressing trend that born-again Christians have a higher divorce rate than agnostics. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-12-10

After tragically losing her first partner and later shooting to death her first perpetrator, the young Sunset Cove police officer is taking some time off to sort things out. And what better place to heal than in the small town atmosphere at the foot of the Coastal Mountain overlooking the Pacific Ocean, taking daily runs on the beach, lunching with friends and daydreaming about her handsome boyfriend, Det. Callen Riley. But all is not as peaceful as it seems and Angel soon finds herself in the middle of a crime wave, family discord, and conflict with her co-workers on the police force. <br /> <br />It all begins when Candace Kelsey, the victim in a domestic violence call that Angel had once answered, phones and begs her to come right over. Despite her own problems, the good neighbor and trained cop in Angel cannot refuse. Apparently, Candace's abusive husband has shot himself and Candace, being the victimized wife she is, dutifully cleaned up the mess to keep her home spotless, \\"The way Phillip expects it to be.\\" Even to the untrained eye, this looks more like a murder than a suicide and the police immediately select Candace as the most likely suspect. Angel is convinced that Candace did not do it and gets her a lawyer, Rachael Rastovski. Then Rachael hires Angel to help her investigate the murder and prove Candace's innocence. <br /> <br />Suspects abound as Angel uncovers many who are not saddened by the death of Phillip Kelsey. While working unofficially allows her a bit more freedom to investigate, her findings often put her at odds with longtime friends on the force who see her as interfering. <br /> <br />Patricia Rushford pulls together many themes in this complex tale that examines domestic violence, guilt, fear and love. She uses interesting techniques that allow the reader to access clues as the detectives work to solve the mystery. And she raises questions regarding revenge and resolution that may or may not be answered satisfactorily. <br /> <br />DYING TO KILL is an altogether well written and satisfying tale, with enough surprises to keep even the most expert mystery fans guessing right up to the last ten pages. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding, a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

Both characters, living in the second half of the 19th century, respond to their slavery differently. <br /> <br />Lacking knowledge of any other way to live, Kitty, who was too young to remember her parents' deaths at the hands of slavetrackers, numbly accepts her mistreatment at the Fuller Plantation in South Carolina as her lot in life, loyal to the mistress who looks at her as no better than an animal. Kitty's desire to be loved is endearing, and her artistic bent adds an interesting component to her personality. The kindling of her anger over her slavery and her desire for freedom comes about only when the ones she loves are threatened. <br /> <br />Her opposite is Grady, a well-developed character who simmers with rage and yearns for freedom throughout the novel. Readers will resonate with Grady's anger as they see the desperate plight of slaves separated from their families, mistreated by slave traders, and sold into grinding work on southern plantations or into New Orleans brothels. It all helps build a believable case for Grady's rage against all white people, which eventually culminates in murder. Grady's love/hate relationship with music, his casual flirtations, and his fear of truly loving anyone again, lest they be taken away from him, are just a few of the ways Austin fully fleshes him out as a believable character. <br /> <br />One of the more dynamic figures in the story is the aging mammy Delia, whose strong faith will endear herto readers. As events in the South careen into chaos, Delia tells Kitty, \\"I don't waste time worrying. I pray,\\" then adds, \\"Praying ain't about getting your own way. It's about asking God to have his way.\\" Delia believes that \\"...the Lord is in charge.\\" Everything that happens to Kitty, Grady, and herself is part of His divine plan. \\"I do know that we can trust the Lord, even when we don't understand why things happen the way we do,\\" she says. Her belief in a God who is in control and her ability to forgive becomes even more intriguing as her past gradually unfolds to Grady and Kitty. <br /> <br />Of all of the characters, the most disappointing is Missy, the belligerent, spoiled mistress who owns Kitty, and who comes off as a bit flat and one-dimensional. It would be nice to see her more fully developed, as her childish tirades sometimes seem over the top, especially after Kitty has her baby. Even a glimmer of occasional kindness would have added authenticity to her character. <br /> <br />A LIGHT TO MY PATH is Austin's twelfth novel, and her experience in fiction shows through her careful attention to detail, vivid backdrops, and smooth dialogue between the characters. The pacing occasionally slows, especially toward the end, and one wishes the book were shorter by about 50 pages. The final scene between Grady and his father is particularly difficult to believe. Yet the plotline and characters are strong enough to keep the reader continuing to the end of the story. Fans of historical fiction with strong faith themes should find this enjoyable tale much to their liking. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby (phrelanzer@aol.com)	2004-12-10

She could not seem to see that I was trying to help. Worn out with the tension between needing to be wise and wanting to wash my hands of it all, I wanted to escape. And yet there was no place far enough away to remove the knots in my stomach, the anxiety in my mind and the ache in my heart.\\" <br /> <br />This kind of honesty characterizes her new book, co-authored with clinical psychologist Sara Dormon. A specialist in dealing with crisis pregnancies, Dormon provides solid advice to both young mothers-to-be and the people who surround them at the end of each chapter. And while the perspectives of several women who have dealt with their own unplanned pregnancies or those of loved ones are included in the book, it's Ruth and her daughter Windsor (who might also deserve an author credit) who provide the book's heart and soul. Taking turns, they detail the difficult decisions and steps that had to be made when Windsor got pregnant, not just once, but twice, as a teenager. <br /> <br />Here, they each write about Ruth's decision not to provide a home for Windsor and her baby during the first pregnancy: <br /> <br />Ruth: \\"To help with making so many decisions with far-reaching consequences, I found that I needed someone to talk to --- someone wise and grounded. I chose to go to a local pastor for advice. He raised issues I hadn't thought of: the deeper questions of motivations, ego and spiritual components. He probed to find out if I thought God was calling me to raise the baby with Windsor. He counseled me to pray about what God would have me do. <br /> <br />\\"My commonsense conviction was that Windsor was not ready to be a parent. And I knew that parenting wouldn't make her grow up. I wanted her to be able to finish high school unencumbered with responsibility for a child. When I took the pastor's counsel and prayed about it, I felt I could not take responsibility for Windsor's life and its consequences, but that she had to face those herself. I felt that stepping in and raising the baby in my home was not best for the baby, Windsor or me. I had to trust God with the results of my decision.\\" <br /> <br />Windsor: \\"When my mother made up her mind that she would have no part in helping me raise this baby it forced me to have to think. Of course I kept trying to change my mother's mind, but she wouldn't budge. I had to ask the practical questions: What was I going to do? Where would I live? How would I support myself? In my heart I already knew that I couldn't raise this baby alone, but I felt that if I admitted that, it would mean I had failed again. <br /> <br />\\"Every day there was an emotional battle going on inside of me. Every day I was torn between my desires to mother this baby or to give my child a better life ... My mother and I were very much at odds with each other. Abandonment isn't a strong enough word to describe how I felt. When she informed me of her decision to not help me with my child I felt helplessly alone. It was a different kind of lonely, more like drowning where no one can hear you calling for help.\\" <br /> <br />The tension and distress between Ruth and Windsor as they struggle to figure out how each of them will deal with this pregnancy is not a pretty picture. But this is a pretty good indication that these women are telling the truth without sugarcoating it. And this is just the kind of straightforward talk that women and girls dealing with crisis pregnancies need to hear. <br /> <br />Windsor decided to release her first baby to adoptive parents, but she kept the second child. However, only cursory attention is given to the second decision. The bulk of the material in this book is about adoption --- why and when it's a good option, how to go about finding adoptive parents, and especially, how hard it is to give away your child. The emphasis on and advocacy for adoption is so pervasive that the book could have been titled \\"You're Pregnant? Consider Adoption.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, adoption is a beautiful decision for both a birth mother without options and an adoptive family. As an alternative to abortion, adoption is clearly the more loving and healthy approach to a crisis pregnancy. And that is a worthy goal of the book --- to present adoption as a viable alternative to young women who would consider abortion because they can't take care of a child on their own and don't have a support structure to help. <br /> <br />Still, as I read this book, I was frequently frustrated that Windsor herself didn't have a support structure that would help her raise her child. It's incredibly pompous of a book reviewer to second-guess the heart-rending decision made by Ruth not to open her home and reorder her life around her grandchild. However, I do think it's worthwhile to mention the idea of a community --- whether it's family, friends, church members, or any combination of the above --- coming together to support a young women in such a way that she is able to continue on with her life, now as a mother, in a holistic way. By all accounts, adoption creates a wound that never heals. Sometimes this wound is an easy tradeoff when compared to the suffering that might be caused by other options. But if it's at all possible for a mother to keep and raise her child in a Godly, loving and supportive environment, how much sacrifice should the body of Christ be willing to make to facilitate that wholeness? <br /> <br />I don't pose this question lightly. My own family and I have had to grapple with it on a very personal level. And just as I'm PREGNANT...NOW WHAT? focuses primarily on the pros and cons of adoption, a similar book might be written about the pros and cons of creating that support structure to allow a young woman to keep her child. <br /> <br />So while it's not a thorough exploration of all the options open to young women facing crisis pregnancies, I'M PREGNANT...NOW WHAT? is still an important and valuable resource for the young women themselves and for those who would prayerfully support these mothers, whatever decisions they make. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-12-10

She has given a description of Bill Bland, a humorless control freak, intricate planner, and lover of mystery novels. The cold, arrogant Bland is accused of embezzling money from Emily Tarell's husband's business, and Emily, whose husband was one of the two men killed at the murder scene, wants justice. <br /> <br />Emily's son Edwin, who witnessed both murders, is more hesitant, cautioning Annie to refuse the assignment unless she can complete it successfully. Yet Annie's fear is less of doing a poor job portraying an aged Bland than her horror of descending into the mind of the murderer --- something she must do if she is to complete her task of drawing him successfully. \\"My mind ran its own movie projector on a daily basis, envisioning in screaming color any stray thought that ventured its way. I could only imagine the insanity it would wreak upon me if I embarked on this assignment,\\" Annie realizes. \\"The deeper I dug into understanding Bill Bland and his murderous brain, the more I would `see' every picture in my head.\\" <br /> <br />The over-stressed Annie's personal life is also in a tangle. She has her hands full bringing up her two children alone, with her rebellious teenage son Stephen's proclivity for the wrong friends and smoking pot, and her adolescent daughter Kelly's newfound love for church, something Annie hasn't yet fully embraced for herself. Yet, ever since her neighbor Lisa Willit was killed ten months previous (in BRINK OF DEATH), Annie has committed to God to seek him. Throughout the book, she continuesher soul-searching. <br /> <br />As Annie begins her research on Bland, strange things start to happen. Someone delivers a dozen dead roses to her door. And is someone watching her house --- and her children? Threats are made. Could Bland have become aware of her assignment? If not, then who doesn't want Annie to complete her task? What evil force is at work? \\"People want to think evil looks monstrous, Ms. Kingston,\\" Sergeant Justin Delft tells her. \\"It doesn't. Evil is the guy next door.\\" <br /> <br />Underlying the story is Annie's own wrestling with her \\"stain of guilt\\" from which the novel takes its name --- her failed marriage, her troubled son, the tragedy that had befallen her neighbors less than a year ago. It's only when Annie gives her guilt to God in a detailed conversion scene that she finally discovers peace for her circumstances. And she'll need it --- more mayhem is right around the corner. <br /> <br />Collins handles changes in point of view adeptly, switching back and forth from Annie in first person to the point of view of the anonymous killer. She also handles flashbacks creatively, allowing the reader to place themselves in earlier scenes involving Bland. However, readers may find Collins sometimes overdoes her descriptions (chills \\"traced spindly fingers\\" between shoulder blades or a chill \\"coiled itself around the length of my spine and hung there, flicking its tongue,\\" or \\"a sudden shiver clutched at my spine\\" or shivers \\"snaked down my spine\\") and has a few strange word choices (\\"The question fisted around my heart,\\" \\"Immediate fear spritzed down my nerves.\\"). By page 50, some readers will have figured out what will be the surprising twist to the story, as this reviewer did. But even if the ending is not a surprise, Collins makes the fast-paced novel still worth the read. <br /> <br />Those who like a little romance with their suspense will enjoy the developing relationships between Annie and Detective Ralph Chetterling, and Annie and her strong Christian widowed neighbor Dave Willit. Although readers looking for romantic resolution will be disappointed, Collins does a good job leaving them hanging for the third installment in the series, which should be eagerly anticipated by Collins's fans. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby (phrelanzer@aol.com)	2004-12-10

Sam heads off to medical school in Boston while Taite retreats to her beloved grandmother's house near the northern California coast to figure out what to do about the pregnancy she decided not to reveal to Sam. Estranged from her own mother and fueled by her feelings of worthlessness, Taite does her best to push away the love Sam offers and resolves to abort their child. <br /> <br />\\"She had never mentioned this part to Sam: no children. Not now. Not ever. Family meant pain. And she was more or less certain her genetic makeup was predisposed to reject those she loved and to have them reject her. Much as she loved Sam, a fear gnawed deep inside that he, too, might abandon her someday.\\" <br /> <br />Little does Taite know that Naini, her grandmother, will need her now more than ever. With Taran and Gwynedd, residents of the 12th century and the main characters in the family's legend, appearing as plain as day in the garden and Naini waking up from vivid dreams with cuts and bruises, it doesn't take long for her to realize and reveal to Taite that her mind is failing in old age. A medical diagnosis confirms it's only a matter of time before her memories and all sense of time will fade into full-blown Dementia with Lewy Bodies, or DLB. <br /> <br />But before she enters the unknown world of dementia, Naini is determined to steer Taite away from having an abortion. To try to convey to Taite the preciousness of the bond between parent and child, she begins to tell her the family legend once again. It's a story Taite has heard many times --- the tale of Taran and Gwynedd and the sack of Han-mere and Gwynedd's daring adventure to save her husband and neighbors ---but she never grows tired of it. And slowly the blessing offered to Taran and Gwynedd at their hasty wedding begins to work its way into her heart: <br /> <br />\\"Almighty God, our heavenly Father, fill these your children with faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, and godliness. Knit together in constant affection your son Taran of Han-mere and your daughter Gwynedd of Han-mere from this day forward. For their children, and their children's children, and for all who will follow through the ages, turn the hearts of parents to children, and the hearts of children to parents. So enkindle fervent charity among them all that they may evermore be filled with love one to another as members of your family through your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.\\" <br /> <br />Still, Taite is stubborn and scared. She goes to the clinic to have an abortion and emerges with both devastating and revealing results. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Sam is across the country preparing for a career as a doctor specializing in stem cell research and thinking about Taite in every spare moment. He has no idea of the issues she's dealing with, but he misses her and wants to restore the relationship. And once again, Naini is working behind the scenes. She writes a dear friend, Luke, who lectures on ethics at the medical school and asks him to keep an eye open for Sam, to encourage him and guide him as much as possible. She believes Sam and Taite are meant for each other and she's eager that Sam reconsider the ethical implications of his chosen field of study. <br /> <br />When Sam turns up in Luke's class, it's only a matter of time before the pair is sparring over the ethical issues involving stem cell research and abortion. But as events unfold, the discussion becomes less theoretical and more personal. <br /> <br />Family relationships are complicated; that's a gross understatement. But thankfully, stories like THE LAST STORYTELLER help flesh out those complications in ways that people can relate toand, hopefully, learn from. The trick with THE LAST STORYTELLER, and other books like it that can be put in the romance novel family, is to get past the dialogue. People just don't talk this way --- to themselves or to others. And, for as messy as families can be, the plot here is pretty clean. Events line up just so. People do what we want them to do; everyone is happy in the end. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the story of Taite and Sam is a good story. Much in the way she spins the tale of Taran and Gwynedd, you might imagine Naini, or one of her successors, sitting by the fire telling future generations about these two young people who made mistakes and found the courage to allow grace to cover their lives. Unrealistic dialogue or not, that's a story everyone can enjoy and, hopefully, learn from. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-11-02

I'm Pregnant": When Your Daughter or Son Faces an Unplanned Pregnancy (Th1nk LifeChange)	Books	5	25	27	N	N	Helpful book full of advice, encouragement, and information	The whole day is fuzzy in my memory. The conversation between my sister and I is even a bit hazy around the edges. I think we were in the car on the way to Walgreens. But I do remember the date. Christmas Eve 1999. Nothing changed that day, but I learned that a lot of things would change soon. It was the day my little sister, then 19, told me she was pregnant. <br /> <br />I wasn't there when she broke the news to our parents a few weeks later, but I have been there over the last four years to see our family come together to cope with and then celebrate the addition of Morgan Mackenzie to our family. So it was with great personal interest that I picked up MOM, DAD...I'M PREGNANT: When Your Daughter or Son Faces an Unplanned Pregnancy. <br /> <br />The book is written by Jayne E. Schooler, whose own daughter, Kristy, got pregnant while she was a 21-year-old college student. She describes the experience this way: <br /> <br />\\"A husband and wife planned and saved all of their lives for the trip of their dreams. They wanted to go to Italy. Carefully saving each spare dime or dollar, they prepared for the journey. They learned the language. They studied the culture. They purchased just the right clothes for the season they would be there. The day finally came and they boarded the plane. After many hours in the air, the flight attendant announced, 'We will soon be landing. Welcome to Holland.' <br /> <br />Startled, the woman frantically pushed the call button, shouting 'There's some mistake. We are supposed to be landing in Italy.' <br /> <br />The flight attendant, attempting to calm the woman, explained, 'This plane does not go to Italy.' <br /> <br />Quite sure that they had simply erred when boarding the plane, the husband asked when the next plane would leave for Italy. The flight attendant replied, 'Sir, I am sorry, there are no planes to Italy.' <br /> <br />Disappointed beyond belief, the husband and wife looked at each other. 'It wasn't supposed to be this way,' they cried. <br /> <br />It wasn't supposed to be this way... 'Holland' is not the place this couple planned to be. 'Holland' is not the place where hundreds of thousands of parents facing an unplanned pregnancy with a daughter or son want to be either.\\" <br /> <br />She goes on to set up the premise for her book: <br /> <br />\\"Parents have two choices when they arrive in 'Holland.' They can remain disappointed, angry, and embittered, thus missing all that God has for them at this rerouted destination. Or they can, through God's mercy and grace, embrace all that God has for them as He is allowed to rebuild and restore the family.\\" <br /> <br />It's the second decision that Schooler advocates, and her book is a detailed map to help parents navigate the streets of \\"Holland.\\" She candidly shares her own experience with Kristy, who decided to keep her child with the help of her parents. But the book also thoroughly surveys all of the different options open to families caught off guard by an unplanned pregnancy. <br /> <br />Chapters explore issues such as the pros and cons of adoptions, the challenges of three-generational living, coping when grandparents become parents --- again, and the long-term impact of abortion on the family. Especially helpful is Schooler's inclusion of the issues specific to paternal grandparents. Unfortunately, the young man involved in the pregnancy, and his family, is often left out of discussions concerning what to do about an unplanned pregnancy. <br /> <br />Chock full of heartfelt stories, solid advice and helpful resources, MOM, DAD...I'M PREGNANT is a valuable book that is sure to provide much-needed information and encouragement for parents, and older sisters, who thought they were on their way to Italy only to find themselves in Holland. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-11-02

Fortysomething sisters Joanne and Melanie are certainly not diametrically opposed; Joanne does attend church, after all. But while Melanie's life is centered on her personal relationship with God, Joanne's is centered on the daily dilemmas of family life. <br /> <br />For Joanne, the devil is in the details: organizing and planning have become a form of serenity. When the sisters discover that they have inherited a vague piece of property in Mexico, Joanne is the one who tries to make everything flow perfectly. Jones Gunn has used this character device in the first two Sisterchicks books, mainly to show that things are out of our hands --- humans can't try to make things go the way they want them to. Here, she quietly but effectively shows that Joanne has allowed her need for control to cover up her lack of inner peace. The women start off on a cruise ship because of their aunt's generosity and well-maintained status as a preferred passenger on the line. When they run into an eccentric and likable group of women throwing a fabulous chocolate-tasting party, they first hear the term \\"sisterchicks\\" --- and Joanne sees in those spontaneous, exuberant ladies qualities that she not only lacks, but also covets. <br /> <br />Soon, Joanne gets the opportunity for spontaneity when she and Melanie discover that they are going to have to rent a car and drive to their deceased uncle's property in order to meet a legal deadline. When they then arrive and see that their inheritance is apparently a lot containing an Airstream trailer, they're a bit downcast. Guess what? They haven't seen the big picture --- and when they do, Joanne is so amazedthat she opens up to her sister's spiritual guidance in an entirely new way. <br /> <br />Like the earlier Sisterchicks books, the characters experience both joys and difficulties, and these are interwoven with scenes from the local culture that are meant to show sisterchicks can learn from experiences quite foreign to them. In SISTERCHICKS ON THE LOOSE they took a Finnish sauna and in SISTERCHICKS DO THE HULA tried a Hawaiian lei-making class. The sombrero-sporting sisterchicks wind up needing overnight accommodations and meet an extremely poor and generous Mexican woman who embodies Christian hospitality. It is a credit to Jones Gunn that she does not allow this character to lapse into stereotype or flatness. <br /> <br />At the end of the interview, Jones Gunn wrote, \\"Being a sisterchick...becomes a validation that within the heart of a sisterchick grows a deeply rooted relationship with Christ.\\" Melanie experiences growth (and will probably experience some change, too), but it is Joanne whose sisterchick experience, newly hatched as it were, is most interesting in this installment. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-11-02

At last count, he has written 50-plus books, and like most of the others, his latest release is the kind of valuable gem that should be set apart and given a place of its own. <br /> <br />COME THIRSTY offers a long drink of cool water to parched throats and \\"dehydrated hearts\\" --- people whose faith has run dry as well as those whose faith was never watered very well in the first place. As with Lucado's other titles, this one is saturated with grace, that aspect of God's love that drenches us with a favor that is incapable of being earned or bought. It's ours for the taking, regardless of who we are or what we've done or how we think of ourselves, and it's central to all of Lucado's books. If we allow it to, he writes, grace will saturate our lives and become as inescapable as the water that surrounds us on all sides when we dive into a deep pool. <br /> <br />The metaphor of water permeates this book, and as always, Lucado squeezes every last drop of imagery out of that metaphor. The writing style is pure Lucado, which never disappoints. A master of the one-word sentence (\\"Society labels you like a can on an assembly line. Stupid. Unproductive...Quitter. Cheapskate.\\"), the author gets his points across in pretty much the way you would expect him to if he were sitting in a rocking chair on your porch, shooting the breeze on a summer afternoon. Holding a glass of tea, of course. Tall. Fresh. Chilled. Sweet. <br /> <br />Also part of the Lucado appeal is his ability to tell a story and relate it to some spiritual truth. To illustrate the lengths to which people will go to save their lives, for example, he recounts the widely reported story of Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who amputated his own hand, which had been trapped under an 800-pound-boulder. \\"Upon hearing the footsteps of the Grim Reaper at your door, whatprice would you pay for an extension?\\" he asks. \\"Would you give your right hand?\\" <br /> <br />And he proves he still has a way with subtle and ironic humor. In the chapter \\"Hope for Tuckered Town\\" --- home of weary, unspiritual people who try to work their way to God --- the daily grind and drudgery of life is so boring that Lucado maintains \\"you'll find more excitement at an Amish prom.\\" Following a delightful anecdote involving a lost pot-bellied pig, Lucado addresses the problem of our struggles, but not before getting in a jab about our tendency toward pettiness: \\"Perhaps your Rubik's Cube has a square that won't turn. If God is our guardian, why do bad things happen to us?\\" (You may be heartened to know that he does not give a pat answer to that question, by the way.) <br /> <br />Nearly half of the book is devoted to a reader's guide that is as much a Bible study as it is a discussion guide for COME THIRSTY. Prepared by writer Steve Halliday, the guide combines a question and answer section with a \\"Drink Deeply\\" action step, all of which relates to a specific chapter. Those steps are as wide-ranging as watching the movie Les Miserables for the chapter \\"When Grace Goes Deep\\" to writing your own obituary for the chapter \\"When Death Becomes Birth.\\" <br /> <br />Jesus invites people to \\"come thirsty and drink deeply,\\" Lucado believes. That's not bad advice for the way to use this book as well.	2004-11-02

Instead, these are the losses we experience in the ordinary, day-to-dayness of our lives: the slow erosion of a friendship due to a change in geography or the simple passage of time; the disappearance of a comfortable routine such as the \\"coming-home hours and staying-home evenings of childhood\\"; the evaporation of \\"the voice I was learning in my private prayers,\\" the voice of God that would not survive a public airing. <br /> <br />Stanford writes exquisitely of these and other losses from the perspective of a single and, later, newly married woman in her twenties. Appropriately, Lauren Winner, an author and essayist who writes in a similar vein, provided the foreword. Among Winner's \\"ordinary losses\\" are those that accompanied her recent marriage: \\"I find dying to my fantasies of being a spinster in some cold New England clime a particularly hard loss,\\" she writes. <br /> <br />In truth, Stanford has gained extraordinary insight from a fairly ordinary life. The product of a loving, stable family --- parents, sibling, grandparents, assorted other extended family members --- she writes from a refreshing, angst-free perspective, thus putting to rest the notion that insight can best be obtained through tragedy and trauma. Stanford had neither, and yet her insights provide a glimpse into the deepest of human emotions. <br /> <br />The essays follow a thematic structure: \\"All I Can Remember: Home,\\" for example, and \\"First Words: Voice.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Between the Mysteries: Wonder,\\" but I confess it was a tough call. Maybe it's because I had not known that someone else could, like me, so vividly recall how she thought about numbers when she was just learning them: \\"1, the proud, bold number in the left corner of my mind. 2, weak but gentle; 3, cocky but alone; 4, strong and kind...\\" And then the threat of losing that sense of wonder, as weary teachers \\"moved us through alphabets and recesses and told us how to write our names in the right places on our math worksheets and did not look for the mystery in-between the letters and the numbers floating towards us.\\" But in third grade, an astonishing restoration of mystery and wonder! The snow outside the classroom seemed \\"white and bizarre, just because Mrs. Pearl thought it was. She had created space for the astonishing to arrive.\\" <br /> <br />ORDINARY LOSSES is a book to be savored and Stanford an author to be treasured. Let's hope we hear more from her in the years to come.	2004-11-02

The setting of Rene Gutteridge's latest novel, BOO WHO, Skary is an unlikely town full of unlikely people doing unlikely things. But if you can get past all of that, you're in for a charming little tale in which the past must be uncovered in order to save the future. <br /> <br />The story opens and it's not long before everyone is in turmoil--- Thief the cat, the sheriff, the mayor, the townspeople, even Skary itself. Until recently, the town had prided itself on being home to the world's most popular horror writer, Wolfe \\"Boo\\" Boone, and therefore, the spookiest town around. Everyone got into the act with attractions including the Haunted Mansion restaurant and Sbooky's bookstore. Even the local \\"wildlife\\" --- the small town's population of cats outnumbers people --- fed into the theme. <br /> <br />But a few weeks ago Wolfe Boone had a transformation. He almost died, became a Christian, and hung up his horror-writing cap. In fact, he stopped writing completely and is, instead, trying to sell cars down at Oliver Stepaphanolopolis's car lot. Now the town and its people don't know quite what to do with themselves. <br /> <br />Without the tourism revenue Boone's fans brought into the community, Skary is on the verge of civic collapse. The stress has caused Mayor Wullisworth to break with reality. He's running around town in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses in the winter, insisting it's balmy outside. <br /> <br />Missy Peoples, Skary's oldest and most despised resident, decides to take matters into her own hands. She determines that their cat population is the town's new meal ticket and buys ads in major newspapers advertising Skary as a cat lover's paradise. No one seems excited about this idea, much to her chagrin. <br /> <br />Melb Cornforth is getting ready for her upcoming wedding to Oliver Stepaphanolopolis. But she has to lose four dress sizes to fit into her wedding gown. Things aren't looking good when she goes back for thirds at Ainsely Parker's Christmas dinner. <br /> <br />Of course, no one would blame Melb for eating three helpings of Ainsley's food. The local domestic diva, daughter of the Sheriff and fiance to Wolfe Boone, is on track to become the next Martha Stewart thanks to the cajoling of Wolfe's former editor. But a meltdown is waiting in the wings as she tries to plan her own wedding and take up Martha's mantle. <br /> <br />Add to all of this some strange \\"ghost people\\" who started appearing around town, a phony psychologist who has more patients than he can handle, a pastor who has started charging for bulletins and coffee on Sunday mornings, and an owl that keeps asking the all-important question, \\"Who, Whooo,\\" and you have a community for which the word \\"quirky\\" was invented. <br /> <br />And maybe, that's just the way it's supposed to be. Because when Martin Blarty, yet another character in this community's cast, goes in search of something that will save Skary, what he finds reminds everyone who they are and why Skary exists in the first place. <br /> <br />BOO WHO is technically a sequel to BOO, but it stands alone quite well. Just put the plausibility meter away and settle in some small-town mystery, hijinks, and humor. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-11-02

If you've long salivated over author Jan Karon's many descriptions of food in her Mitford novels, you'll be delighted to find Viking has at long last assembled the recipes into one delectable volume, JAN KARON'S MITFORD COOKBOOK & KITCHEN READER.    Despite a nod to Father Tim's diabetes, this is pure, unadulterated, break-out-the-butter, down-home southern cooking. Don't look for calorie counts or number of servings. Most likely, with this carb-fest of comforting, sweet-tooth ticklin' recipes, you don't want to know the nutritional information! Just think of it as pure enjoyment.    Each recipe is presented in the order of its appearance in the Mitford series, and six recipes are included from the forthcoming and concluding novel, LIGHT FROM HEAVEN (2005). The recipes range from the simple Silver Queen Corn (butter, sugar, corn, salt and pepper) to the dust-off-your-apron-and-clear-your-schedule-for-the-day complex Esther's Orange Marmalade Cake (although this is photographed as a two-layer cake, the recipe calls for a more complicated three-layer).    Recipes run the culinary gamut: main course meals (Rector's Meatloaf, Ray's Barbecue Ribs, Cynthia's Bouillabaisse); basic side dishes (Puny's Potato Salad); mouth-watering desserts (Louella's Buttermilk Chess Pie, Cynthia's Raspberry Tart, Mama's Ice Cream in a Tray); beverages (Marge's Sweet Tea with Peppermint), and breads (Magdolen's Spoon Bread, Louella's Cinnamon Rolls). Playful recipes like Dooley's Fried Baloney Sandwich Supreme are paired with Dooley's Second Favorite Sandwich --- The Doozie, consisting of white bread, smooth peanut butter and Cheerios (\\"Fold the sandwich in half and jump on your bike and go\\"). Look for the unexpected, such as Barnabas's Dog Biscuits or The Lord's Chapel Communion Bread, and the unusual --- a page devoted to Russell Jack's livermush --- what it is, where to get it, and how to cook it.    Declining to try the livermush, I experimented with three recipes: Velma's Chili, Cynthia's Heavenly Tea, and Emma's Fudge. Velma's Chili is a thick, meaty concoction with the surprise addition of cloves and celery, and won rave reviews when I made it for a casual dinner party this fall. Like many cooks might do, I tinkered with the recipe a bit, adding more tomato sauce than called for. Cynthia's Heavenly Tea is a memorable, rich drink with an unusual blend of tea, apricot nectar, mint, frozen lemonade, and a squirt of almond extract. Emma's Fudge didn't set up firmly for me, but was scrumptious anyway --- cooled, spooned up and eaten, rather than cut into squares.    Though the recipes whet the appetite, they are only a smidgeon of what makes this cookbook so appealing. Sprinkled throughout the beautifully designed pages are table blessings, poetry, and little vignettes about Karon's own culinary life and history. Recipes are interspersed with full-color, mouthwatering artwork and photographs of the featured foods, often pictured on Karon's own tableware. \\"Puny's Saving Grace\\" tips offer snippets of cooking wisdom on everything from keeping lettuce fresh to freezing ripe bananas. The recipes appear alongside their specific excerpts from the Mitford novels, inviting contemplation of favorite passages while Uncle Billy's Sweet Potato Pie bakes in the oven.    Just why is there so much yummy food in the \\"Mitford\\" books? Karon answers that question in her page-long essay, \\"Writing Hungry,\\" one of many such nostalgic reflections from the author that makes the book so wonderfully palatable. Karon remembers life as a freelance writer when bills piled up, her cupboards were bare, and she dreamed of good food --- food that found its way into the pages of the Mitford novels. Karon tells how she learned to make do, even creating soup broth from chicken bones (recipe included). A lovely two-page essay recounts one of Karon's \\"starving writer\\" Christmases and how she canned apples, picked free from a tree in her yard, for Christmas gifts (complete with an original poem and a recipe). But of that time: \\"What I learned mostly, however, is that God is faithful,\\" Karon writes.    It's the personal warmth of Karon that gives this cookbook and kitchen reader its charisma. On one page, Karon confesses, \\"Cover your eyes! Plug your ears! It's confession time. I love anything fried!\\" Another page, detailing her grandmother's biscuit recipe, notes, \\"If you have a grandmother, go call her right now and tell her you love her to pieces. Actually, if you have a mother, call her, too.\\" Gratitude to her readers permeates the pages: \\"...together our imaginations have made Mitford real, very real --- and I couldn't have done it without you.\\"    Mitford fans --- your collection won't be complete without this book!

I'VE LOST MYSELF!, picks up the story of 87-year-old Dorothy Jean Westra and her endearing and sometimes wacky cast of friends. There's plenty of excitement in Partonville (population 1,423) to keep Dorothy up late at night talking to the \\"Big Guy \\"in her bedtime prayer-chair. <br /> <br />In her first installment, DEAREST DOROTHY: ARE WE THERE YET?, Baumbich brings to life a believable cast of multi-generational characters living in Partonville, \\"a circle-the-square\\" town in the northern part of southern Illinois. The second novel in the series, DEAREST DOROTHY, SLOW DOWN, YOU'RE WEARING US OUT, chronicles Dorothy's move from Crooked Creek Farm, her birthplace that she has always called home, to Tess Walker's old house. Now it's Partonville's Centennial Plus Thirty celebration and there's plenty of disagreement about how to mark the occasion, which will be combined with that annual Pumpkin Festival. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Raymond Ringwald tries to whip the elderly and off-key community band into shape for the festival, with Dorothy noting \\"Lord have mercy on all who listen....And Lord have mercy on us after the Pumpkin Festival if we've forced them to listen to such a mess!\\" Mayor Gladys McKern has a bee in her bonnet about replacing the old clock downtown with a new digital model, getting Crooked Creek Park officially launched, and generally kicks up a fuss. When Gladys lobbies for traffic to be reversed on the square in commemoration of the Centennial Plus Thirty event, it's not hard to guess that chaos lurks just around the corner. <br /> <br />Some of the nicest moments in this novel occur in the personal and e-mail exchanges between Dorothy (aka \\"Outtamyway\\" on the Internet) and the transplanted city slicker Josh, now confused about how to be cool in his new school and still hang on to old friendships. He's adjusting to life in \\"Pardon-me-ville,\\" experiencing all the angst of teenage romance, and planning a date with one girl for the Pumpkin Festival dance while keeping an eye on Shelby at the same time. Conflicted about the changes in his life, Josh emails Dorothy with a desperate message: \\"Help! I've lost myself!\\" It's an engaging, intergenerational moment. <br /> <br />Josh's mother Katie copes with her own problems adjusting to small town life, loneliness, and mothering a teenager. Dorothy encourages Katie, telling her, \\"All new beginnings and chapters take time, Katie. Just give it some time. I'll move this issue right up to the top of my prayer list.\\" But Katie's discouragement grows as she tackles her new life at Crooked Creek farm, where she attempts to sort through the enormous amounts of papers left to her in chaos by her Aunt Tess. In the letters she reads are mysterious references to a Core Four Covenant --- something which, if Dorothy explains it, may throw Katie's life into turmoil and turn the town upside down. When Pastor Delbert gives a sermon on forgiveness, its not long before several of the characters will be called on to practice what he preaches --- himself included. <br /> <br />Although there are a few trouble spots in the dialogue, it's nothing that Baumbich's characters can't overcome through the sheer force of their offbeat personalities. All your favorite characters are here: Dorothy's best friend May Belle and her mentally challenged adult son Earl; Jessie and Arthur Landers; 62-year-old Nellie Ruth; Maggie Malone, the owner of La Feminique Hair Salon and Day Spa; Paul and Jessica Joy, and their sweet baby daughter Sarah Sue. Even the annoying Gladys is more fully fleshed out in this installment, becoming a sympathetic figure to readers.

God is in the details, he counters, including those details that often lie hidden in plain view on the nightly newscasts. \\"We're used to looking for the huge,\\" he writes about newscasters and viewers alike. \\"But tiny things can have more weight than we can imagine. I think a lot of the stories we cover are like that...We miss the 'still small voice' when we focus on the thunderstorm.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, he admits, most of what you see on television news is negative or sensational or depressing. That's what makes it the news --- the anomalies, the disasters, the tragedies. But Dean believes observant viewers --- those who have eyes to see and ears to hear --- can discover God in the same stories that others have labeled negative. <br /> <br />Few would disagree, for instance, that the abduction and murder of a child makes for a horrific story, the kind that causes your heart to hurt like nothing else can and tempts you to swear off television news forever. Even seasoned reporters found themselves at a loss for words in 1999 when young Amber Hagerman's body was found near Arlington, Texas. \\"We've just got to give this one to God,\\" a fellow journalist said to Dean at the funeral. As senseless and heartbreaking as the girl's murder was, her death proved not to be in vain. The tragedy resulted in the institution of the now-nationwide Amber Alert System, which immediately notifies law enforcement agencies, broadcasts outlets, and motorists (via electronic highway signs) whenever a child is reported missing or abducted. God was indeed a part of the story, and the lives of countless children have been saved as a result. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Dean shows God at work in the details of many of the major stories he has covered in his 30 years as a Dallas-area broadcast journalist --- stories of such magnitude as the Oklahoma City bombing and the breakup of the space shuttle Columbia in the skies over Texas, and of such poignancy as human-interest pieces on an inner city soup kitchen and a man whose ministry to others is played out in the role of Santa Claus. <br /> <br />Among the most compelling is his account of the 1999 shootings during a midweek service at Wedgewood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. During his murderous spree, Larry Gene Ashbrook killed seven people and injured seven others before turning the gun on himself. In an interview with the pastor following the tragedy, Dean asked about the seven who died. Pastor Al Meredith immediately corrected him. \\"There were eight who died,\\" he said, including Ashbrook in the tally and thereby speaking volumes about grace, compassion and forgiveness. <br /> <br />In each chapter, Dean's writing reveals his skill as a storyteller --- an often overlooked talent shared by the best journalists in the country, whether in print or on the air. One of his best tales is the must-read account of a woman named Rose whose story never appeared in or on the air in her lifetime, at least not in so much detail that it would have brought unwanted publicity to her \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" burger joint. It's stories like this one that prove Dean can handle human-interest pieces as masterfully as he handles hard news. <br /> <br />If you're a news junkie like I am, you're bound to love this book, if for no other reason than it gives us an arsenal of ammunition to defend an addiction that others cannot comprehend. Fortunately for Dean and Revell, FINDING GOD IN THE EVENING NEWS should appeal as well to the general Christian public --- a public that has become increasingly disenchanted with the media and disturbed by their negative excesses. By showing God at work in the stories he has covered, Dean offers viewers a reason to tune in and discover God for themselves.	2004-11-02

But five years later, circumstances bring them both back to the same North Carolina town where they once lived and loved each other, and where both of their families have been praying for their reconciliation for half a decade. <br /> <br />But that's not all. Sam and Annie's last name is Truelove. Neither seems to have been involved in any kind of close relationship in those intervening years, though Sam's career as a surgeon and Annie's as a journalist wouldn't exactly have kept them cloistered. The home they shared when they were married is exactly as it was the day Annie took off in Sam's truck, seemingly for good. Their clothes still hang in the closets, and all of their belongings appear to be intact --- no mildew or damage from hungry insects or rodents, no interruption of electrical service, pretty much everything still in pristine condition. And every year, Sam goes to the same restaurant on the same date at the same time, hoping that Annie, his...um...true love, will appear and give him a second chance. <br /> <br />If none of that bothers you, then the rest of the book won't either. Not even the fact that these two people are so utterly obsessed with each other that every little thing they do seems to remind them of each other. I half expected Annie to take a breath and suddenly remember that she also used to take a breath when she lived with Sam. Still, they take precious little action toward reconciliation even though the constant flood of memories seems to rule their lives. (In a moment of clarity and decided understatement, Annie realizes that \\"the memories of her life were all entwined with Sam.\\")  <br /> <br />Despite all that, the basic plotline is believable and even compelling. A poor decision on Sam's part during heart surgery has left a young patient on life support for five years, and the girl's time is running out. The story of the battle between the state and the girl's family becomes national news, and Sam takes a leave of absence from his practice to prevent negative publicity from hurting the Tennessee hospital he is affiliated with. When Annie, who is between newspaper jobs on the West Coast, learns of the worsening situation, she takes advantage of her time off to return to the Asheville area --- which is exactly where Sam plans to spend his leave of absence and sort out his future. There they are reunited, but the reunion is less than cordial --- just days earlier, Annie filed for divorce. There's a lovely twist at the very end that makes for a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br />Nichols's writing, for the most part, is fairly straightforward, though there are some nice touches here and there, along with moments of genuine insight and honesty. After a seasoned believer tries to answer Sam's questions about why God had allowed the surgery to go wrong and his marriage to fail, Sam doesn't want to hear the usual \\"God loves you\\" speech: \\"Sam shook his head. The answer wasn't satisfactory. And he realized then that it wasn't an explanation he wanted from God as much as an apology.\\" That's honesty. <br /> <br />Here's another nice passage, in which Annie realizes that her hopes for a perfect life with Sam are unrealistic: \\"The bright, shining life she had imagined with him vanished. Reality took its place. Not the flawless, backlit reality of fantasy, but the real, bumpy, scarred, beautiful, breathing, warm-skinned life she knew she was meant to have.\\" <br /> <br />At its essence, this is a book about hope, written for Christians rather than for unbelievers. AT THE SCENT OF WATER offers readers a reason to believe that the God they know --- or once knew --- is able to give them \\"beauty for ashes and the oil of joy for mourning.\\"	2004-11-02

When the conflict between the two men drives a wedge between her and her husband, Glennis opts to provide a safe place where her son can get the love and support she believes he needs. In doing so, she places her marriage on the line and threatens to do more harm than good to Jacob. <br /> <br />It doesn't help that Sarah, the Harmons' college-age daughter, has planted herself firmly in her father's camp, providing little comfort to Glennis and none to Jacob, who at 19 has traded in school for a string of dead-end jobs and a group of deadbeat friends whose main goal in life is to partake of the narcotic du jour. It also doesn't help that Geoff Harmon serves in a high-profile position as city attorney, or that the Harmons are well-known in the community as a model church-going family. <br /> <br />Hesitant to expose her family for what it has become, Glennis keeps the worst of her pain inside, hiding it even from her friend Sherri. But the situation with Jacob escalates --- or degenerates --- to the breaking point for her. She shares the truth about Jacob's addiction with Sherri, who proves instrumental in helping Glennis navigate her way through the mess her family is in --- a mess that includes the secret life Geoff has been living for six months or more. <br /> <br />Embedded in the title CRYSTAL LIES are at least three symbols integral to the plot: the false promises of crystal meth, Jacob's current drug of choice; the transparency of the many lies Jacob tells his mother and himself; and a Waterford crystal vase that represents the Harmons' shattered marriage. Carlson's treatment of those themes and others sets her apart from many of her peers; with each of her recent books, she further reinforces her fearlessness in handling difficult issues in a realistic and often gritty way not generally seen in Christian fiction. <br /> <br />The spiritual element is very much a part of the story, and it is blessedly well integrated into the dialogue and story line. Carlson provides spiritual content without ever preaching or inserting sermonettes into her characters' conversations. And unlike the typical, fictional Christian family, the Harmons sound like a real family: Jacob quit youth group in middle school; Glennis gets mad at God, sneaks a cigarette outside church (just once, but still...), and realizes that the Christian life is not all her church tried to make her believe it would be; various family members use words like \\"suck\\" and \\"freaking\\" and no one freaks out; and a remorseful Geoff makes a decision about their future that is utterly unpredictable. <br /> <br />Every aspect of this story rings true. Anyone who has been involved to any extent with an addict will recognize the all-too-familiar behaviors, which Carlson so capably describes: \\"It seemed to happen every time Jacob had gotten involved in drugs. It was as if he suddenly became the expert at throwing confusion everywhere. He could put up a smoke screen and get people on the defensive before they even know what had hit them.\\" Sound familiar? If so, you'll appreciate Carlson's insights into a world you already know; if not, you'll get an education in the way that world works. <br /> <br />CRYSTAL LIES is clearly one of the best works of Christian fiction to release so far this year, in any genre. It's the kind of book you can actually share with your non-Christian friends without cringing --- and the kind you can read with the same result. <br />	2004-11-02
US	30329810	R23WL69MPU8BFG	0842379428	774560976	Heaven	Books	5	656	685	N	N	A compelling and refreshing view of life after death	In his new book on heaven, appropriately titled HEAVEN, Randy Alcorn tells the story of an English vicar. When asked by a colleague what he expected after death, he replied, \\"Well, if it comes to that, I suppose I shall enter into eternal bliss, but I really wish you wouldn't bring up such depressing subjects.\\" <br /> <br />If we're honest, a lot of us might agree with that vicar. The thought of spending eternity floating about on a cloud, strumming the proverbial harp, sounds a bit, well, boring. Huckleberry Finn certainly thought so. <br /> <br />\\"She (Miss Watson) went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do was go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever. So didn't think much of it.... I asked her if she thought Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that because I wanted him and me to be together.\\" <br /> <br />It's exactly this kind of bland vision of eternity that Alcorn's book seeks to dispel. <br /> <br />\\"The pious Miss Watson had nothing to say about Heaven that appealed to Huck. What would have attracted him was a place where he could do meaningful and pleasurable things with enjoyable people. In fact, that's a far more accurate description of what Heaven will actually be like. If Miss Watson had told Huck what the Bible says about living in a resurrected body and being with people we love on a resurrected Earth with gardens and rivers and mountains and untold adventures --- now that would have gotten his attention!\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, and it got my attention too. Despite my education at a Bible college, I've spent little time thinking about or studying the logistics of eternity. And I'm not alone. Whereas heaven used to be on the forefront of the collective Christian mind, it receives little attention these days. Alcorn suggests a number of reasons for the waning interest in heaven, but the bulk of his polemic effort is to stoke curiosity and he doesa tremendous job. <br /> <br />For example, do you realize that the place you go when you die is not the place where you will spend eternity? I'll let Alcorn explain: <br /> <br />\\"The answer to the question 'Will we live in Heaven forever?' depends on what you mean by Heaven. Will we be with the Lord forever? Absolutely. Will we always be with him in exactly the same place that Heaven is now? No. In the intermediate Heaven, we'll be in Christ's presence, and we'll be joyful, but we'll be looking forward to our bodily resurrection and permanent relocation to the New Earth.\\" <br /> <br />Alcorn goes on to quote theologian Wayne Grudem who says, \\"Christians often talk about living with God 'in heaven' forever. But in fact the biblical teaching is richer than that: it tells us that there will be a new heaven and a new earth --- an entirely renewed creation --- and we will live with God there.... There will also be a new kind of unification of heaven and earth.... There will be a joining of heaven and earth in this new creation.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Oh yeah,\\" I thought to myself. \\"The New Earth!\\" If you've studied Revelation you know that Christ will return to remake the world after the Tribulation and Armageddon and all those staples of the Christian imagination take place. This is clear regardless of when or if you think the rapture will actually happen. Somehow I had never integrated Revelation's teaching on the New Earth with my thoughts about eternity. Indeed, it seems to support Alcorn's idea that the place we go when we die is only intermediate, temporary lodging until we can move to Earth part 2. <br /> <br />Frankly, I find the idea of living on a perfect earth full in a resurrected body in God's presence to be incredibly compelling. Forget the clouds. Where did we get that idea anyway? <br /> <br />HEAVEN is divided into three sections: a theology of heaven, questions and answers about heaven, and living in light of heaven. So after he explains his views on heaven,he provides practical answers to questions everyone has wondered about at one time or another. In HEAVEN you can find answers to questions including: \\"Can people see what's happening on the Earth from heaven?\\" \\"Will we experience time in heaven?\\" \\"Will the New Earth be like Eden?\\" \\"Will we maintain our own identities in heaven?\\" and \\"Will our resurrected bodies have new abilities?\\" And that's just scratching the surface. HEAVEN is nothing if not comprehensive. <br /> <br />It's important to note that, despite his clear conviction about his understanding of heaven, Alcorn is quick to welcome any biblical evidence that he has come to the wrong conclusions about eternity. Being biblical is his utmost priority. <br /> <br />\\"From the beginning, I want to make it clear that it's vitally important that this book be true to Scripture. I believe that most of my conclusions, even those that significantly depart from current evangelical thinking, will stand up to biblical scrutiny. Inevitably, however, some may not. In the context of prophetic statements, the apostle Paul says, 'Test everything. Hold on to the good' (1 Thessalonians 5:21). It's up to you to test by God's Word what I say, hold on to the good and reject the bad.\\" <br /> <br />Such humility is refreshing, as is Alcorn's vision of the afterlife. It turns out that Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer might want to go to heaven after all. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-11-02

This hefty tome is the ideological sequel to the bestselling HOW NOW SHALL WE LIVE? that Pearcey wrote with Chuck Colson a few years ago. Whereas HOW NOW SHALL WE LIVE? presented the case that America is \\"post-Christian\\" and that we need to eschew a solely personal faith and work to rebuild our culture with a biblical worldview, TOTAL TRUTH digs into the specifics of that culture and demonstrates what such a worldview might actually look like. <br /> <br />Pearcey is a devotee of the Swiss theologian Francis Schaeffer, and as such the foundation of her work is his assertion that modernity is built on a \\"two-story\\" view of reality with \\"facts\\" on the first floor and \\"values\\" upstairs. In such a paradigm, Christianity is banished upstairs, unable to interact with all that is empirically verifiable on the first floor. Pearcey contends that many Christians themselves live with this upstairs/downstairs mentality and don't realize how this dualistic mode of thinking keeps them from integrating their faith with the stuff of their everyday lives. <br /> <br />\\"The first step in forming a Christian worldview is to overcome this sharp divide between 'heart' and 'brain.' We have to reject the division of life into a sacred realm, limited to things like worship and personal morality, over against a secular realm that includes science, politics, economics, and the rest of the public arena. This dichotomy in our own minds is the greatest barrier to liberating the power of the gospel across the whole of culture today.\\" <br /> <br />Pearcey defines her worldview as \\"a biblically informed perspective on all reality\\" and subsequently covers her bases, providing credible commentary on everything from stem cell research, to Rousseau's rebellion against the Enlightenment, to the impact of the industrial revolution on the function of the home and family unit. <br /> <br />\\"After the Industrial Revolution, the home eventually ceased being the locus of production and became a locus of consumption --- which means that women at home were gradually reduced from producers to consumers. Household industries with their range of mutual services were replaced by factories and waged labor. Instead of developing a host of varied skills --- spinning, weaving, sewing, knitting, preserving, brewing, baking, and candle-making --- women's tasks were progressively reduced to basic housekeeping and early childcare. Instead of enjoying a sense of economic indispensability, women were reduced to dependants, living off the wages of their husbands. Instead of working in a common economic enterprise with their husbands, women were shut off in a world of private 'retirement.' Instead of working with other adults throughout the day --- servants, apprentices, clients, customers, and extended family --- women became socially isolated with young children all day.\\" <br /> <br />This interesting glimpse at the roots of the feminist movement is a good example of the illuminating context TOTAL TRUTH puts our cultural experience into. With Pearcey's mastery of such a broad range of discourse, it's no wonder that a number of programs are using TOTAL TRUTH as a textbook. But don't let that scare you off. Pearcey has a gift for making complex issues clear. This is a book that even a worldview novice can enjoy and benefit from.

Very, very dead. Every bit as dead as he was when we last viewed his body in RED, the second volume in Ted Dekker's trilogy, \\"The Circle.\\" Now, in WHITE, the final title in the series, the fate of the world hinges in large part on the corpse that has lain for three days in a sealed room in a basement in France, compliments of a decidedly bad guy named Carlos who is intent on destroying the nation of Israel. Unless that corpse comes to life and manages to somehow get to the United States --- in a matter of hours, no less --- it's pretty much the end of the world as we know it. <br /> <br />In the previous books, the living Hunter dreamed his way from the world we know to another fantastic world, a world of the future in which his role is as vital as it is in this world. With his death here, he remains in that alternate reality, one that readers have come to know and love. There, Hunter is very much alive despite the best efforts of an enemy force known as the Scabs to change that situation. But his mission is not confined to stopping the war that is annihilating the population in that reality; he is still aware that he holds the key to stopping a virus that is threatening to kill off the population of the world we know, minus a select few survivors. <br /> <br />In order to stop the virus, though, Thomas has to return to our world and come back to life. As all that is getting sorted out, a two-pronged love story is unfolding in the alternate reality --- a romantic love story as complex and dramatic as any, and the spiritual love story between Elyon and Justin and their followers. <br /> <br />Blood figures prominently in the two realities, as does the transfer of blood between the two worlds. Also proving transferable is the all-important Book \\"The Story of History\\" that could change the history of our world. But unlike the other three transferable elements --- knowledge, skill and blood --- the Book falls into the wrong hands, thwarting Hunter's heroic attempt to save the world. Dekker handles all this, along with every other twist and turn in the plot, with an even greater skill than he displayed in the previous two books in the series (the first being BLACK). And that's saying a lot. <br /> <br />The stories of both realities find their culmination in an ending as satisfying as it is stunning. Maybe other readers will see it coming, but I did not. The resolution was completely unexpected, and yet it's the kind of ending to which you say, \\"Yes --- that's exactly how it should end.\\" <br /> <br />The series is a cross-genre work, one that should appeal equally to readers of suspense, sci-fi and fantasy, whether Christians or not. There's no question that WHITE is the strongest of the three books and that the trilogy as a whole is a remarkable achievement on the part of the author. If Dekker's fans were loyal before --- and they were --- his accomplishment with The Circle series should further cement their bond to him.	2004-11-02
US	30329810	R1SNFJ1729RM40	1557253536	121040922	Murder on the Riviera	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A delightful murder-mystery	Mary-Jane Deeb's first novel represents quite a departure from the type of writing she's accustomed to. A professor of international politics at American University and a Near East specialist for the Library of Congress, Deeb's previous books related to her fields of study. With MURDER ON THE RIVIERA, a delightful mystery, you get the distinct impression that there's a whole lot of creative imagination in that deceptively academic mind of hers. <br /> <br />Recent Yale graduate Marie-Christine de Medici --- yes, that de Medici family --- receives a somewhat premature inheritance of $10 million from her very much alive French grandmother, her Grand-mre. So alive is Grand-mre that she decides for Marie-Christine just how she should spend a portion of the money when she takes it upon herself to invest Marie-Christine's money in a local paper in her own hometown of Grasse, France, near Cannes. Yes, Grand-mre is very much the matriarch of the de Medici clan, or at least the French offshoot of it. <br /> <br />Marie-Christine's transition from heiress to working editor and publisher takes a sharp turn when the previous publisher is found murdered --- and every suspect is in some way associated with the newspaper. Things heat up for the budding journalist when several attempts are made on her life, presumably because the unknown perpetrator believes the murder victim gave her information on an unsolved, two-year-old murder just hours before his death. <br /> <br />As in any good mystery, not everyone is who they seem to be, and not everyone is without a few skeletons in their closets that make them prime candidates for a guilty verdict. Deeb handles all the twists and turns and subplots well, and turns out a pleasurable and satisfying read. She also has a wonderful sense of humor and subtly inserts evidence of it throughout the book, as in this admonition from Grand-mre and Marie-Christine's commentary: \\"'Don't drink on an empty stomach, cherie. Wine can get to your head very quickly.' It has got to my head, and I am quite happy with it there.\\" <br /> <br />As enjoyable as the book is, it is not without its glitches. Thankfully, none are related to the plot. Glitch number one: Deeb frequently drops pronouns, resulting in the kind of sentences that sound as if they were dashed off in a journal or hastily written letter --- \\"am disappointed\\" or \\"cannot believe what I am hearing,\\" that sort of thing. That's not a problem in and of itself, especially since the point-of-view character is an aspiring reporter. <br /> <br />But when a literary device like that is overused and inconsistent, it becomes distracting. I had to read a lot of sentences twice to figure out what the dropped pronoun would have been and therefore what the sentence was referring to. \\"Get up at the crack of dawn\\" --- is someone ordering her to do that, or is she \\"journaling\\" that? This dropped pronoun bit is also the only problem with the dialogue, which is otherwise believable and natural, and with the characterization, which is otherwise consistent. I just can't imagine all those diverse characters dropping all those pronouns all along the Riviera. <br /> <br />Glitch number two: Deeb uses lots of unfamiliar French phrases that are likely to stop readers who don't know any French and even those who have a basic knowledge of it. I spent way too much time searching my brain's database of college French trying to translate phrases like \\"sirop d'orgeat\\" (sounds like something you'd put on pancakes at a questionable party, n'est-ce pas?). Finding out it means \\"syrup of barley water\\" hardly helped identify it as the adult beverage it apparently is. Les martinis, anyone? <br /> <br />It's also a bit unlikely that a police investigator would not readily connect a certain sequence of numbers with a bank account, or that the police would not have thought to examine a certain set of newspaper photographs related to that earlier murder --- but I suspect I'm quibbling now. Ignore the French phrases, don't let the dropped pronouns get to you, and forgive the occasional implausible scenario. Just go ahead and enjoy the story.	2004-09-03

Their vastly different but parallel stories eventually intersect in a way that challenges both of them to take a risk and leave their \\"dark valleys\\" behind. <br /> <br />Celia Coleman seems to relish her dark valley, choosing to live in a basement apartment in a small South Carolina town and keep any socializing to a bare minimum. Orphaned as a teenager, Celia spent her remaining high school years in the Georgia home of her legalistic and grim grandmother. After attending college in Delaware, Celia moved to South Carolina and took a job in an art gallery. <br /> <br />When her grandmother dies, Celia is forced to keep her promise to return to Georgia for the funeral. The unhappy reunion with her relatives unsettles her, as does her discovery that she has inherited her grandmother's meager estate --- a rundown house and adjacent store, and assorted household possessions. Instead of making a final break with her Georgia past as she had wanted to do, Celia will remain connected to it, at least until the estate is settled. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Bruce Healey's story is a bit tougher to tell without giving away too much of the plot line. Let's just say that he's not what he appears to be at first. He tries to befriend Celia but finds her to be surprisingly uncivil --- in fact, downright icy. Her behavior is perfectly understandable to the reader, although Bruce is baffled by it. But then, he knows a whole lot more than the reader does at first. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the end of the book, which will probably be a subject of debate among Turner fans until they get distracted by her next book. Some will no doubt consider it to be a pat ending, and I can understand that. But I thought she handled the ending well. It was so like God, in so many ways. The story begins to reach its conclusion in a wonderful scene --- or actually, a series of scenes --- in a Cracker Barrel restaurant, and from that point on, I had no trouble believing that the hand of God was completely involved in the lives of the characters. <br /> <br />One of the gifts that sets Turner apart as an author is the exquisite detail of her writing. She crafts every scene so meticulously that readers can easily become immersed in the setting. That's true of all of her books. Unlike her other novels, though, NO DARK VALLEY is much more character-driven than plot-driven, with much of the story developed through the interior thoughts of the point-of-view characters. That makes for a slower-paced novel, but that wasn't a problem for me and may not be for many of Turner's longtime fans as well. Regardless of where you place this in comparison with her previous novels, NO DARK VALLEY is a worthwhile read that underscores the many reasons why Turner is a favorite in the Christian market.	2004-09-03

Pinsky understands the Disney \\"theology\\" as well as he understands the concerns of religious people who have taken that theology to task over the years. Contemporary readers may be most familiar with the failed Baptist boycott of a few years ago, but as the author points out, both Jews and Muslims have also attacked the entertainment giant. Back in 1933, the American Jewish Congress --- Pinsky is Jewish, by the way --- charged Disney with perpetuating a Jewish stereotype in the animated short The Three Little Pigs, in which the big bad wolf disguises himself as a Jewish peddler with a large hooked nose and a Yiddish accent. Similarly, Arab and Muslim groups expressed outrage over the Middle Eastern stereotypes portrayed in the 1992 feature Aladdin, which I suspect you would have to be blind not to see. As Pinsky points out, the villains are all stereotypical Arabs while the stars of the show, Aladdin and Jasmine, more closely resemble tanned Southern Californians, despite the surfer girl's almond-shaped eyes. <br /> <br />But just what is this Disney gospel --- this blend of \\"faith, trust, and pixie dust\\"? It's American cultural religion: belief in the ability of the self to overcome adversity, faith in faith itself, adherence to the American ethic of morality and hard work. Pinsky cites a wonderful quote from evangelicalism's Phil Vischer, of VeggieTales fame: \\"Like a house dressing designed to appeal moderately to almost everyone while offending no one, Disney created a sort of 'house religion,' absorbing much of the benefits of Judeo-Christian belief while leaving behind any 'unseemly' obligation to conform to the will of a higher authority...[appealing to] people who want to believe in something that doesn't require anything of them. That's the religion we've all been dying for.\\" <br /> <br />Pinsky traces the evolution of the Disney gospel --- which includes the good news about inclusivism and environmentalism, two terms that rankle evangelicals --- from the studio's earliest releases to the 2003 release of Brother Bear and touches on Disney-related news as recent as the arrest several months ago of Tigger --- okay, the man who wore the Tigger costume, if you must get technical --- on a charge of fondling a young teenager. (Tigger was found not guilty, by the way.) <br /> <br />Some of Pinsky's analyses: The Black Cauldron: \\"The Judeo-Christian construct that frames most of Disney's animated features is wholly absent in this pagan fantasy...neither God nor stars nor fairy godmothers intervene\\"; The Little Mermaid: \\"...a seismic shift...in the way young women are portrayed. In contrast to her predecessors, Ariel acts rather than being acted on. She makes decisions and takes risks...[an indicator] of the changing role of women in the West\\" (a change some evangelicals denounced as radical feminism at the time); The Lion King: [the movie] \\"demonstrated that, after all the decades of caricature and stereotype, it was indeed possible for Disney...to reach beyond the Western experience and the Judeo-Christian construct.\\" <br /> <br />Pinsky concludes that Disney's films are \\"useful tools in building a general, moral sensibility among children and in reinforcing parental and religious values\\" --- values that, if strong enough and communicated clearly enough, will not be undermined by the Disney theology. He draws this conclusion not only as a religion reporter but also as a concerned parent who has struggled with the effects of media saturation on young minds.  <br /> <br />THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO DISNEY is an enlightening read for Disney lovers and Disney haters alike --- and for those who have become increasingly troubled by the media giant's seeming change in direction from the straight and narrow. You may reach a different conclusion from Pinsky's, but you'll do so armed with a wealth of information to defend your decision. Highly recommended.	2004-09-03

His expertise is ironic on one level; living in an intentionally television-free household, he knew nothing of Pottermania until after the fourth book released. Even then, he ignored the books, largely because the person who first mentioned them to him was a bit of a New-Ager whose reading preferences ran counter to his traditional Christian sensibilities. On another level, though, Granger's ability to speak and write with authority on J.K. Rowling's series is entirely understandable, given the wealth of classical allusions in her writings --- allusions that Granger immediately spotted when he gave in and read the books after an evangelical Christian recommended them to him. <br /> <br />What Granger discovered is that the Potter series presents a wholly Christian worldview, despite the magic and sorcery and incantations and all manner of evils that make Christian parents shudder. He addresses their concerns from an intelligent and faith-filled perspective, being a parent who shares those concerns and who takes great care to protect his seven children from occult influences. But to Granger, the Christian message in the series is so profound and so apparent that he was surprised to realize that so few Christians recognized it --- and that so many Christians denounced the series, attacked its author, and forbade their children from reading the books. <br /> <br />With LOOKING FOR GOD IN HARRY POTTER --- a rewrite of his self-published THE HIDDEN KEY TO HARRY POTTER, revamped and refocused specifically for the Christian market --- Granger not only sets the record straight but also tells it straight: \\"Christians, of all people, should be celebrating the Harry Potter novels and the attendant Potter-mania. The Potter books are the most edifying works of fictionwritten in many years, as any classicist, medievalist, or lover of traditional English plays and novels might tell you...[they] touch our hearts because they contain themes, imagery, and engaging stories that echo the Great Story we are wired to receive and respond to.\\" <br /> <br />Granger first presents a thorough, biblically based defense regarding the use of magic in the series and explains why it should not be a stumbling block for Christian readers. He then examines some of the themes in the books that should resonate with Christians --- the basic conflict between good and evil; life, death, and resurrection; transformation; the dual nature of humankind; prejudice; love; and many more. He offers an analysis of much of the symbolism in the books and the meanings behind many of the characters' names. He looks at the debate over worthwhile versus dangerous literature and writes about the literary elements and theological concepts readers need to look for. In short, Granger covers a lot of bases. <br /> <br />One section from THE HIDDEN KEY that did not make the cut in LOOKING FOR GOD is a delightful look at other books about the Potter series. THE HIDDEN KEY is perhaps the best self-published book I've read to date, and one of my favorite sections was Granger's take on books that are either critical of the series or that attempt to analyze it. He even rated his own book. It probably doesn't belong in this volume, but if you ever come across the first book, it's worth looking at that section. <br /> <br />To me, there's no question that LOOKING FOR GOD IN HARRY POTTER is an important addition to the wealth of commentary on this all-time bestselling book series. In Granger's book, Christian parents will discover a depth and range of insight that will help them make an intelligent, well thought-out decision regarding the value of the series and its use in their homes. Just as important, they may find that they've acquired a new set of skills with which to more accurately judge controversial books in the future. <br />	2004-09-03

Comparatively less has been written about the Pentagon. I always thought that this was because the Pentagon is a military installation and the levels of security there kept these stories quieter. <br /> <br />The fire from the crash in D.C. found victims there without regard to age, rank and serial number just as it did in New York and Pennsylvania. REFINED BY FIRE is the story of one of these victims, LTC Brian Birdwell, who survived the plane's impact by chance --- he was not in his office when the plane hit, but rather in a hallway outside. His two co-workers died at their desks. <br /> <br />The story is that of Brian's courage through thirty-plus surgeries, endless skin grafts and raging infection. While this was happening with great speed and accompanying stress, Mel was beside her husband, fighting for his dignity and sharing a strength and resolve to maintain both his honor and his position. The faith of the Birdwells is clear. God had His hand on their shoulders from the moment that fire hit. Both Mel and Brian turned to Scripture and prayer when many others might have collapsed from despair and anger. Scripture took on new meaning to Mel as she read passages and related them to their lives. <br /> <br />Mel read Scripture to Brian even as he lay unconscious. Instead of questioning their misfortune, she focused them on moving toward healing. They could not run through it, they could not hide from it. Instead, they needed to draw strength for each new step from God and each other. <br /> <br />I love the title of this book. These three words define so much about the Birdwells. They were refined. Their faith was refined. Their family spirit was refined. And through their battle they emerged not tarnished, but rather polished and shining in a new level. <br /> <br />A few personal notes about this book. I had the opportunity to meet Brian and Mel in June at a publisher's conference. I was walking from aisle to aisle when I spotted them with their publicist, who is a friend. We started to chat without my knowing who they were, or their story. After this brief conversation, there was something about their quiet resolve and sense of mission that drew me to read this book. It was like they were personalizing to me the healing that this country has been going through since 9/11. <br /> <br />I truly feel that we hurt more and needed to grieve more than we actually did for these events. Their horror was so overwhelming that the media backed off from the story, feeling people needed to move beyond it. But there are moments when I still wonder if much of the discord and polarization in this country right now comes from the way we were led to \\"move on\\" after these events when in reality the \\"safe\\" world we all knew came apart that day and its implications hurt more deeply than we may even know. <br /> <br />While I saw Brian's scars when talking to him and Mel, their pride and their humility exalted them in my eyes; they were more stripes of honor than of disfigurement. By the way, I know that pride and humility are two strange words to yoke together. However, in Brian's carriage and Mel's quiet grace, I saw that they understand that they have been tested and came through better for it, but they are also humbled as they know that theirs is just one story of this day that fortunately ended as well as it could. Their mission is to minister to others and speak and share their story. <br /> <br />I, who normally speed read, instead read REFINED BY FIRE in small chunks over the course of about two weeks. Each morning I found myself reading a chapter or two before getting out of bed. I found myself thinking about what the Birdwells had endured --- and risen above --- as I moved throughout my day. Part of the reason I feel I \\"rationed\\" this book is that reading about the painful effects of Brian's burning was tough reading. Also, I truly think that when we remember the effects of this tragedy with personal stories, we all grieve and then heal a bit more. Which is a healthy thing. <br /> <br />As we commemorate the third anniversary of 9/11 in September, reading REFINED BY FIRE is a fitting way to reflect and remember. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carol Fitzgerald	2004-09-03

Piper manages to pack loads of scripture and insight into a slim volume of fewer than 150 pages, and he does so by adhering to his usual standard of excellence. <br /> <br />Arranged topically, the book's 13 chapters cover Jesus' purpose, deity, excellence, joy, power, wisdom, and so forth. (In typical Piper style, he titles a chapter on the desecration of Jesus \\"The Glorious Poverty of a Bad Reputation.\\" I love it.) Each chapter begins with scriptures or quotations, or both, and ends with a thoughtful prayer that is longer than usual for a devotional type of book. But this book strays from both the usual Bible study format and the usual devotional format, creating a rich hybrid that ministers to the mind and the heart. <br /> <br />All that is to say that this is a book to be read and, well, savored. Despite its brevity, it's not the kind of book you can breeze through if you expect to get much out of it. As an example, the chapter on Jesus' sacrifice, \\"The Glory of Rescuing Sinners, Not Removing Satan,\\" handles the problem of evil in a convincing and beautiful way. Piper writes: \\"Christ must have had a very high stake in the ongoing existence of Satan, because, even though he has the right and power to annihilate him now, he defeats him in stages at the cost of his own life.\\" What's the stake? \\"God wills for his glory to shine forth not only through acts of physical power, but also through acts of moral and spiritual power that display the beauty of his grace with lavish colors,\\" he writes. \\"To take sinners out of Satan's hands by virtue of Christ's sin-bearing sacrifice and his law-fulfilling obedience to the Father was a more glorious victory than mere annihilation of the enemy.\\" <br /> <br />The main value in Piper's work is the way it will enrich an individual believer's walk with God. But there are two other areas in which the book becomes a valuable resource: as a counterpoint both to the liberals who embrace a view of Jesus akin to the conclusions of the Jesus Seminar and to that segment of evangelicalism that has reduced Jesus to a casual buddy. Neither view does justice to the glory of God, and neither provides a full understanding of the character, mission and glory of Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />Piper probably won't change a whole lot of liberal minds, drawing as he does on scripture as his sole source of information on Jesus. But evangelicals would be wise to use this book as their text for introducing others to Jesus --- and for reacquainting themselves with the one on whom they base their faith.	2004-09-03

I was desperate. My first son was not sleeping through the night, was eating nothing but mashed bananas, and was not obeying. The kicker: He would look at me, grin wildly and defiantly dump his entire toy box after I told him, \\"No.\\" <br /> <br />Cajoling, negotiating, threatening --- nothing worked to get this kid to do something he didn't want to do. I was taller and stronger and, at least in my mind, smarter, but I became stupid and turned to mush when it came to him. It was a battle of wills, and he was winning. <br /> <br />I admit it. I was one of those mothers who would start out sweet and soft-spoken, telling my son kindly, \\"No, Sean. No, Sean. No, Sean\\" --- only to switch gears and yell, \\"SEAN NOOOOO!!!\\" seconds later. The result: He still blissfully ignored me. <br /> <br />Friends and family began pushing parenting books at me. Thankfully, THE STRONG-WILLED CHILD was one of them. I read and tried to absorb everything. Dobson advocated spanking. Yikes. What would my Baby-Boomer friends think of me? We were spanked and seemed none worse for the experience, but... <br /> <br />Dobson's arguments favoring discipline, structure and routines made so much sense --- especially in light of the chaos I was wreaking, placing such a high premium on reasoning with a 2-foot high toddler, as I was. His style is encouraging. I remember thinking, \\"I'm doing EVERYTHING wrong, but there's hope.\\" But then again, reading \\"The temperaments of children tend to reflect those of their parents\\" made me remember my mother's words (under duress) to me: I hope you have a child just like you. <br /> <br />I took Dobson's advice, feeling empowered, balancing love with discipline, and to my relief, things around here started to improve. And proving there is no one as obnoxious as the newly converted, I gave a copy of the book to all the moms in my son's playgroup. <br /> <br />In THE NEW STRONG-WILLED CHILD, even though it's been rewritten, updated and expanded, not much has changed in Dobson's straight-talking, \\"Because I am The Adult and You Are The Child\\" approach to parenting. He's still warm and encouraging, and brimming with common sense. This time, though, his common sense advice is backed up with current research. What began as a hunch to Dobson --- that some kids are compliant and some are \\"strong-willed\\" --- turned out to be scientifically true. Dobson's bottom line is still the same: Parenting is a balance of love and discipline. <br /> <br />In many chapters, he uses a Q & A format to reinforce points. Here's an example: <br /> <br />\\"Q: I like your idea of balancing love with discipline, but I'm not sure I can do it. My parents were extremely rigid with us, and I'm determined not to make that mistake with my kids. But I don't want to be a push-over, either. Can you give me some help in finding the middle ground between extremes? <br /> <br />A: Maybe it would clarify the overall goal of your discipline to state it in the negative. It is not to produce perfect kids. Even if you implement a flawless system of discipline at home, which no one in history has done, your children will still be children. At times they will be silly, lazy, selfish, and yes, disrespectful. Such is the nature of the human species. We as adults have the same weaknesses. Furthermore, when it comes to kids, that's the way they are wired. Boys and girls are like clocks; you have to let them run. My point is that the purpose of parental discipline is not to produce obedient little robots who can sit with their hands folded in the parlor thinking patriotic and noble thoughts! Even if we could pull that off, it wouldn't be wise to try. <br /> <br />The objective, as I see it, is to take the raw material our babies arrive with on this earth and gradually mold it, shaping them into mature, responsible, God-fearing adults. It is a twenty-year process that involves progress, setbacks, successes and failures. When the child turns thirteen, you'll swear for a time that he's missed everything you thought you had taught --- manners, kindness, grace, and style. But then maturity begins to take over, and the little green shoots from former planning start to emerge. It is one of the richest experiences in life to watch that blossoming at the latter end of childhood.\\" <br /> <br />Back in 1978, Dobson was just beginning his remarkable legacy, writing the first of 33 books, launching a radio show heard by 220 million people each day on 7,300 radio stations located in 122 countries around the world. Back then, I too was just beginning to leave my mark, raising my sons (I now have four) and reading Dobson, who was doling out parenting advice, not knowing who was listening and, perhaps, benefiting from it. <br /> <br />Until now. <br /> <br />Thanks, Dr. Dobson. And keep up the good work. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2004-09-03

Granted, as he writes, \\"Hand motions are a staple for camp songs, and I often joke about where old John Fischer songs go to live out their days: They go to camp.\\" But they also go to drug and alcohol rehab centers, where tough and world-weary recovering addicts play right along and experience a joy often missing from their lives. <br /> <br />In this slim gift book, Fischer displays his considerable skills as a writer in six reflections that mirror the six thematic elements in the lyrics of his best-known song: morning, evening, in-between times, God's love, worry, and the circular \\"so\\" --- a word that becomes drawn out in the singing and fleshed out in the writing, \\"making a big deal of it on purpose,\\" he writes. \\"It's what wraps the song around itself and keeps it singing all day.\\" Throughout the book, Fischer weaves anecdotes about the writing of the song and the impact it has had, and offers thoughtful insight into how the lyrics apply to our everyday lives. <br /> <br />What's striking at times is the way the lyricist himself has discovered new levels of meaning in the words he wrote three decades ago. One line in the song refers to the pressure that comes in the in-between times of our day --- all that happens between the moment we wake up and the moment we settle down for the night. \\"I just realized recently that this is not about pressure but about pressure on the way. We're on the verge of it. It's right around the corner. It's coming...It's about the anticipation of something bad about to happen.\\" The song continues to reveal new truth to the songwriter. <br /> <br />Likewise, Fischer has gained years of insight into the line about \\"remembering\\" God's love and his promise to stay --- a line he admits he had doubts about all those years ago. In the intervening years, though, he has taken notice of the many times scripture admonishes God's people to remember --- remember his love, remember his miracles, remember his faithfulness, remember his history of coming through for them. \\"This is not an exercise in nostalgia...When you feel pressure coming, remembering that God loves you and will be with you always is something you apply to the fear like a tourniquet,\\" he writes. \\"You stop the bleeding with the truth and wait on God for further instructions.\\" <br /> <br />Fischer brings it all together in a lovely and wonderfully told story about the only time his six-month-old son would meet Fischer's 89-year-old mother. That alone is worth the reading. LOVE HIM IN THE MORNING may be a little book, but there's nothing trivial in its content.	2004-09-03

A runaway teenaged prostitute, a bitter medical doctor, and a nomadic ranger couldn't share anything else ... or could they? In SAFE HAVEN, the second novel in Hannah Alexander's Hideaway series, the authors take a slightly different approach than in their first book, introducing these three disparate characters in separate chapters and slowly showing readers how their paths will intertwine. <br /> <br />While things are still relatively peaceful in the town of Hideaway, recent land purchases and development by the megalithic Beaufont Corporation are threatening to change life there permanently --- for the worse. Karah Lee has arrived fresh out of medical residency and ready to assist Dr. Cheyenne Allison in her small but bustling practice. Allison, the protagonist of the first book, has taken on emergency room duties in a nearby city and is now engaged to Dane Gideon, presently the town mayor and still foster father to a number of teenaged boys at his ranch. Taylor, who lives in a recreational vehicle, has duties in Hideaway, but tries to avoid having any ties there. Meanwhile, fugitive Fawn winds up in the town after filching a bus ticket --- and realizing that her fellow passengers are all in mysteriously bad shape. <br /> <br />Alexander combines details of small-town life (fans will be amused to watch Karah Lee devour the same black-walnut baked goods of Bertie Meyer's that Cheyenne could hardly stomach) with sound medical action and real Christian growth. There is very little pew-jumping or praise-shouting here; instead, each character comes to salvation in his or her own way, and finds support for newfound beliefs in his or her own way, too. Fawn's plight, from beginning to end, is particularly moving and believable --- in this case, her allegorical name seemed right, and not forced. <br /> <br />Hannah Alexander is the pen name of husband-and-wife writing team Mel and Cheryl Overall. Their first novel in this series, HIDEAWAY, earned glowing reviews from both the secular and CBA press, and this second one is a strong follow-up to that book. While some of the faults of HIDEAWAY are still apparent here --- some scenes seem flat, especially when they're dealing with very worldly matters like graft and murder --- the pace of the book helps readers overlook inconsistencies. Also, the authors do not shy away from modern dilemmas, sin or doubt. They are unflinchingly honest about human failings. Mel and Cheryl keep the story moving; whenever I found myself wondering, \\"What the heck could this be about?\\", suddenly a very interesting and obviously well-planned answer would appear. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-09-03

Jackson's voice was so fresh and her concerns were relevant covering issues that often are not addressed. While the first Yada Yada book could easily have stood by itself, there was plenty of material in it for at least one sequel, and maybe more. <br /> <br />I opened THE YADA YADA PRAYER GROUP GETS DOWN eagerly since I had enjoyed the first book so thoroughly and wanted to see what Jackson would explore here. Sure I had some trepidations about this second novel since I am all too familiar with the sophomore slump that many authors experience. Looking at the cover I saw the new shot of dancing feet that was much like the delightful line of feet in brightly colored socks on the cover of the first book. This screamed to me that the books were being packaged together. I then had concerns that Jodi Baxter, the protagonist of this \\"package,\\" would therefore wind up as a packaged person, whose quirks and flaws would become frozen in time. <br /> <br />I should have trusted more in Jackson's God-given talent and inspiration, because she has delivered a second novel that builds on the first and, in some ways, surpasses it. <br /> <br />As it opens, Jodi and her family are in the midst of a steamy city summer. Their home, or \\"two-flat,\\" in downtown Chicago is about as far from the Gold Coast as you can get, and unlike many characters in Christian fiction who seem to be effortlessly upper-middle-class, the teaching couple struggles for money (Denny still doesn't know whether or not his contract for the upcoming year will come through) and participates actively in their local culture. <br /> <br />The members of Yada Yada, as fans will know, are an eclectic bunch both ethnically and sociologically, including an elegant South African faculty wife, a very young ex-con baker, a middle-aged Messianic Jewish bubbe, and a permanently indignant African-American salon owner. It's the latter's aging mother whose troubled past provokes a rift in the prayer group, and it is this rift that forces Jody and Denny to confront their present-day beliefs. <br /> <br />Those beliefs affect their daughter, their son, and Jodi's quiet Iowa parents, as well as the Yada Yada members, their families, and an unwelcome new acquaintance, Becky Wallace. But what makes this book work is not necessarily this brand-new action, but the interactions of Jodi and her sisters in Christ as they get to know one another for better and for worse. Jodi is not a perfectly cheerful cardboard Christian --- she doesn't always cook with love, she holds grudges, and she argues with her husband. Instead, she's a struggling, contemporary woman of faith whose life reflects her most cherished beliefs. I closed this book wondering how Jackson will further explore this group in future books. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-09-03

I've read Brown's book and even written a tongue-in-cheek research piece about some of the history involved in his mystery, and I'm here to tell you my honest opinion: THE ASSIGNMENT was more interesting, more honest and more fun to read.      Like Brown, Mark Andrew Olsen bases his book on a small, secretive Roman Catholic group: the Order of St. Lazare, comprised of just seven priests. Like Brown, Olsen's protagonist is faced with a seemingly insurmountable task that involves convincing others of an impossible premise. Like Brown, Olsen's book is fast-paced and has characters careening from the States to all corners of Europe --- and, in some cases, even further. And that points to one of the things that is different about Olsen's approach. First of all, he unabashedly includes the spiritual --- he even includes the mystical, and a lot of it!      But hang on for the ride, because even though his use of several different perspectives and forms of narration (including the protagonist's diaries) can get a little confusing, Olsen uses the chaos to allow readers' suspension of their disbelief. By the novel's end, you may not consciously subscribe to the idea of angels and demons (pace Dan Brown), but you'll be cheering the former on.      In fact, one of the most interesting things about Olsen's novel, for a CBA author, is that he has structured it more as a battle of good versus evil than a battle of Christian versus nonbeliever. Conversions happen, but they aren't necessarily the \\"born again\\" kind. While not all readers will agree with Olsen's scenarios or his theology, this non-preachy yet grounded style is both refreshing and thought-provoking. What does it mean to be both a Jew and a Christian believer? What does it mean to be an academic and a believer? What does it mean to be a Catholic as opposed to a Protestant? Through a cast of characters that includesa young American graduate student, a pair of CIA officers, a post-John Paul II Pope, Mossad agents and shadowy terrorists, Olsen raises these and more questions.      Thankfully, he doesn't attempt to answer them all nor does he leave the door open (funny, since the symbol of an open door is important to the Order involved) for what could have been endless sequels (spoiler alert: if you want to know what I'm getting at, take a look at the name of the Order again).      While I could go on and on about plot twists and turns, let me end by saying something else about this book that differentiates it from THE DA VINCI CODE: at the end of THE ASSIGNMENT, for its attendant flaws, I found myself moved --- both by the outcome and by the sense of this author's living faith in God.      --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-08-02

I often get the feeling that the authors aren't creative enough to come up with catchy titles on their own. Not so with Dave Burchett. His title may be a parody on WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE, but it's a highly creative one nonetheless. And it certainly is descriptive --- unfortunately, we all know what he's talking about.      Burchett opens with a full admission that he has been a very bad Christian who happened to some very good people. In other words, he has been the kind of Christian who gives other Christians a bad name --- a judgmental, hurtful person who often could not see the damage he was inflicting on others. Because of that, and because of the pain that has been inflicted on him, he writes with authority about the problems we have treating others as Christ wants us to.      Thankfully, he writes with an acerbic wit and a healthy dose of humor, injecting a droll comment when you least expect it (\\"Of major Christian denominations,\\" he writes, \\"the Catholics and Lutherans have the lowest rate of divorce, perhaps because they can drink.\\"). It's Burchett's humor that helps elevate this book above other gripe-fests about the sad state of relationships among Christians; he recognizes the intrinsic value of offering comic relief to readers who have just been hit with some fairly ugly truth about themselves and their brothers and sisters in the faith.      Given the treatment Burchett and his wife, Joni, once suffered at the hands of the church, it's a wonder that either of them have a sense of humor --- or that they even bother with Christians anymore. Born with a severe birth defect that meant certain death, their daughter Katie lived several months, significantly longer than the medical authorities expected her to. The Burchetts made adjustments to their family life to accommodate an infant that they knew would not be with them for long. Then, as Burchett writes, \\"the church entered in...[and did] what I would not have thought possible: They made our pain worse.\\" Fearing that Katie might die during a church service or somehow affect the health of the other children (with whom she had no contact), the mothers in their small congregation held a secret meeting and decided --- without the Burchetts' knowledge or input --- that she was not welcome in the nursery.      As appalling as that is, Burchett quickly points out that similar stories are not all that hard to come by. He's right, of course; many of us can recount horror stories about the pain Christians have inflicted on each other and on the culture around us. But he doesn't leave us holding the problems in our hands with no idea of what to do about them. He offers solutions and guidance on how we can change our ways to become the kind of Christ-followers who would make others want to follow Christ as well.      That will require Christians not only to correct our penchant for intolerance, unkindness and downright cruelty, but also to overcome our tendency toward, um, flakiness. In an absolutely hilarious chapter titled \\"Godly or Gaudy?\\", Burchett strolls through a Christian bookstore with Jesus, who \\"stopped at the What Would Jesus Do? bracelet display. I found out what Jesus would do. He moved on.\\" After the stroll, he does make some serious comments about responsible consumerism --- right before letting us in on his pre-recorded message for the Talking Tombstone that will grace his grave.     Bottom line is this: If you're thin-skinned, you probably won't consider this book to be \\"edifying\\" (though you would clearly benefit from reading the chapter on \\"CSL: Christian As a Second Language\\") or even funny. But for the rest of you --- the rest of us --- this is a wonderful and challenging read.	2004-08-02

After all, his \\"liberal\\" opinions on provocative issues like the Islamic faith, social justice, gays and lesbians, female clergy, and even salvation don't exactly square with contemporary evangelical thought. Or do they?      Campolo describes himself as \\"someone who works hard at trying to ferret out the truth about what God is doing in the church and in the world, and the part we have in that work...I have not finished thinking about the topics addressed in this book. I expect to wrestle with some of them as long as I live and am able to think.\\" Frankly, I think many evangelicals today could describe themselves in a similar way, but they lack the courage to admit that their thinking on these issues has led them to the same path Campolo is on. They fear losing peer respect or ministry support, and so they quietly allow the Tony Campolos to take the heat for the opinions of a silent evangelical minority.      To try to distill Campolo's views on the highly charged matters he writes about would do him an injustice, because throughout the book we glimpse a mind at work rather than a mind made up. He examines each issue as if it was an immensely intriguing object he is seeing for the first time, turning it this way and that, analyzing it from above and below, regarding it from inside and out. And yet it's clear that he has spent years, if not a lifetime, considering many of the issues that threaten to split the evangelical camp in two.      One thing about Campolo, though, is that he's careful not to write, or speak his mind, from a dogmatic perspective. Rather than maintaining that his is the final word on a matter, you get the impression that he sees himself as a pilgrim on a journey he has taken so many times before that he believes it's his responsibility to assist fellow pilgrims who are still struggling to find their way. There's no pontificating here, none of the self-assured arrogance frequently found among fundamentalists --- a group Campolo believes has commandeered evangelicalism and created an atmosphere of anxiety that keeps some Christians from speaking their own minds.      \\"What I have to say,\\" he writes, \\"should not be taken as some kind of summa theologica, but rather as a challenge to my sisters and brothers to be willing, for the sake of eternal truth, to endure the heat that will come from those in our evangelical community who think the most important thing in life is to play it safe.\\" Ultimately, that's what sets Campolo apart --- his willingness to take risks by thinking outside the evangelical box and having the guts to express those thoughts publicly.      SPEAKING MY MIND offers a challenge to progressive evangelicals who recognize the need to be pliable and teachable, to maintain an open mind, and to allow God to be as big as God is. That challenge is to thoroughly analyze each controversial and divisive issue with a sense of wonder at the grace of a loving and forgiving God who cannot be owned or claimed or appropriated by any one group --- including evangelicals.	2004-08-02

Her twin has been estranged from his family for years over his alternative lifestyle, and after a disagreement at the party, he storms out. Colleen, determined not to lose him again, drives from her small town in Oregon to his Seattle home --- and finds out a truth she wasn't prepared for: Stephen is very ill with the AIDS virus. <br /> <br />After dealing with the emergency at hand (Bette Nordberg is a former registered nurse and therapist --- not only are her scenes of caregiving accurate, they're also fast-paced and interesting), Colleen decides to bring Stephen back to her own home. But there are so many problems: Colleen doesn't consult her husband Kevin, nor does she talk to their two teenaged children. She also ignores the fact that her brother neither shares her Christian faith nor wants to do so. Most of all, Colleen has spent a lifetime pushing away her family members --- and a personal secret that is tearing her up inside. <br /> <br />Few authors, Christian or not, are willing to confront terminal illness honestly and lovingly. Yes, lovingly: for although Colleen faces all manner of criticism, from her husband to her son to her fellow parishioners, her care for Stephen takes over every aspect of her being. Whether she is waiting patiently in a doctor's office for him or trying to decide what he'll want for lunch, Colleen is the very model of a modern caregiver. <br /> <br />Nordberg does not let this dwindle into a heartwarming tale of footrubs and hospital vigils. There's a much bigger issue at stake. For some authors, that issue would be Stephen's sexual preference. Nordberg does deal with this, deftly weaving in details from Stephen's life (his companion's earlier death from the same illness, his childhood feelings about being different, etc.) along with reminders that modern Christians have fundamental disagreements with homosexuality. There is never a question in the novel that Colleen or anyone in her community believes Stephen's lifestyle is the best choice. <br /> <br />However, Nordberg is also too sensitive a storyteller not to realize that the biggest issue --- of faith --- needs to be tackled, and Colleen would never have to confront her own demons if she were simply allowed to change bedding and shed tears. Her controversial decision to bring Stephen to her home forces her to own up to why having him there is so important to her. The truth, once revealed, frees up her energies to remember that God is present even in the midst of this grief and pain. And if He is present, what does that mean? What does it offer? <br /> <br />Surprise, surprise: there are no easy answers. But there are easier and more meaningful communications once Colleen, Kevin, and their family have come to recognize that faith lived out in the smallest ways can have an impact. All too often, stories of conversion and of fatal illness can be tedious. This book is neither; it's engaging, intelligent and compassionate. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick <br />	2004-08-02

Someone's mom would be dying, someone would get a diagnosis that they did not want to hear or a car accident would spin someone's life in a new direction. It reminded me that C.S. Lewis had passed away the same day as JFK's assassination and his death was barely noted as a result. <br />  <br /> Tammy Trent was one of those people. September 10th dawned wonderfully for her and her husband, Trent. They were enjoying some idyllic days on a Jamaican beach before doing a mission trip on another part of the island. Thrilled to be together --- away from cellphones, Internet access and the demands of Tammy's music career --- they were reveling in their time together and making plans. Trent was an accomplished free diver, which means that he dove without air tanks, able to hold his breath up to five minutes. The beautiful Caribbean waters beckoned him to make a dive at Blue Lagoon before he and Tammy went off for a relaxing afternoon together. <br />  <br /> Trent pushed off and turned back to wave to Tammy one last time before he made his dive. This was a tradition of theirs. One never left; you walked away and then turned back again and again. Trent waved and dove into the blue water. Fifteen minutes went by and he still was not back. Then 30 minutes. Then 45. Tammy knew something was drastically wrong. Beckoning people to help her, a search for Trent commenced. But he was not found that day, even when divers went to 240 feet down. <br />  <br /> She called her family back in the States to share her heartbreaking news. Her father-in-law raced from a meeting in L.A. to be with her. Everyone else vowed to be there in the morning.  <br />  <br /> The morning of 9/11 the world fell apart and Tammy found herself trapped in a nightmare in Jamaica without her family and friends surrounding her. Her father-in-law was the only family member to make the trip, as he had left California late the previous evening. He quickly took over the details of searching for Trent, whose body was found later that day. There was one gash to his head; the assumption is that he was struck by a boat or a piece of coral. No one will ever know what happened. <br />  <br /> For the next eleven days Tammy was trapped in Jamaica, unable to return home. As her father-in-law tried to handle the paperwork, Tammy found a Bible in her hotel room and turned to Scripture for guidance to get her through this nightmare. While her friends and family could not be there to wrap their arms around her, God's word was there for her, and through her Bible reading she tried to make sense of what was going on.  <br />  <br /> The metaphor of Trent holding his breath to dive and Tammy learning to exhale to get on with her life is a beautiful one. It draws readers into the essence of their relationship. They fed their relationship with notes, cards and little traditions that bound them together. Tammy shares these intimacies and, from them, readers draw how much of her strength came from Trent --- and how she relied on him. <br />  <br /> When she was on tour with him, she knew he was just a glance away at the soundboard. She was free to make music while he managed the details. Suddenly she was on her own. Shortly after the tragedy while she was still in Jamaica, her mom called to say, &quot;Keep breathing, honey. Trent wants you to breathe.&quot; <br />  <br /> Readers will feel the rawness of her hurt and will walk with her through the healing process. She and Trent clearly had a special relationship, but Tammy is not above also admitting her shortcomings along the way. She is quick to share the moments where she was more selfish and immature than Trent. She easily admits her own faults in the relationship and how she may have hurt him along the way. <br />  <br /> Tammy Trent fans will enjoy this book, but so will readers who are looking for a story of hope. Yes, tissues are a requirement with reading this one, but I dare you not to send a card to a loved one, or make another special expression of your love once you finish reading it. The book made me stop and think about all the little things that consume us and do not allow us the time to be there for the people we love. I daresay that Tammy and Trent put more into their 18 years together than many people have in a lifetime. Take that away and figure out how you can put more into the relationships that matter to you. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Carol Fitzgerald <br />	2004-08-02

She has spent much of her twenties and thirties as her mother's caregiver, but after the Alzheimer's-stricken Mary Elizabeth dies, Aurora (herself stricken with agoraphobia) rattles aimlessly around their Manhattan apartment. Despite the nosy-parker attentions of her mother's oldest friend and neighbor Clara Bowman, and in spite of the much gentler inquiries from her newest friend and neighbor, Philip Cannon, Aurora finds that things for her are falling apart and she has no center. <br />  <br /> One of the reasons Aurora has no center to hold on to is because her mother's death leaves her a de facto orphan. Her father, Theodore Norquest, a wildly successful popular novelist, left the family before she was born and she has never received any communication from him. Slowly, as Aurora begins to explore what she might do now, she rekindles the interest she has always had simmering about contacting her father. <br />  <br /> This is where Philip, a software engineer of about her own age, comes in handy --- he knows how to help Aurora (who can't even make it down to her building's lobby) connect to the world via the Internet (she's been receiving groceries, medicines and other supplies for years from New York City's endless variety of delivery services). While Philip remains gentle in his inquiries and in sharing his faith with Aurora, he obviously wants to help her break out of her cocoon rather than enabling her to remain stuck. <br />  <br /> However, the darkest horizon is still to come (did you think it was a coincidence that &quot;Aurora&quot; means &quot;dawn?&quot; Not a chance --- but more on that in a moment). Mesmerized by a beautiful woman in a nearby penthouse who has everything, but lives an empty, perhaps morally repugnant, life, Aurora questions whether there is any purpose for her own life and makes a bad decision. When Philip comes to her rescue, bitsand pieces of light peek through, and she learns that some of her beliefs about the past aren't accurate. By the story's end, Aurora is living in a new day and, while she has a lot of work ahead of her, has regained her hope and humanity. <br />  <br /> By setting Aurora in her high-rise apartment, giving sparse details about appearances and situations, and including a somewhat mystical element, Hunt has given her novel an ethereal quality that is very appealing. Does this sound like a fairy tale? It's meant to be: Hunt set out to write something completely different from her previous books --- a parable. Of course, the original parables told by Jesus were simple stories, and although Hunt does keep things simple in THE AWAKENING, her modern artistic viewpoint (and perhaps modern readers' needs, too) means that things are a little more complicated in Aurora's world. That's why it feels more accurate to call this an allegorical novel, along the lines of John Bunyan's classic, THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS, than to call it a parable. <br />  <br /> But in the end that's quibbling over literary terms, since this novel does teach a lesson: we are all searching for Our Father, and so often we don't know how hard He has been trying to reach us. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick <br />	2004-08-02

But most white-collar, suburban churchgoers do not expect the message that Carol Kent and her husband received in October 1999, just a few weeks after she had mused, &quot;Does life get any better than this?&quot; (Their careers --- directing a national Christian speakers' bureau --- were on track. Their only son --- an earnest Christian, a navy lieutenant --- was married and the stepfather to two young daughters, whom they enjoyed grandparenting.) The devastating news? That their son, Jason, was in jail, charged with the first-degree murder of his wife's ex-husband --- a crime witnessed by several bystanders. With this as the book's setting, you quickly understand the subtitle &quot;Unshakable Faith in Unthinkable Circumstances.&quot; <br />  <br /> As may be obvious, the book's title is drawn from the biblical story of Abraham, who was willing to give up all claim to his son Isaac. It is a book about surrender and the paradoxical lessons it can teach. &quot;There is hidden power in our unthinkable circumstances,&quot; she says. Subtitles of the eight chapters outline the journey: &quot;The Power of Unthinkable Circumstances;...of Relinquishment;...of Heartache;...of Community;... of Hope;...of Faith;...of Joy;...of Speaking Up.&quot; <br />  <br /> The narrative, which includes quotes from journals of Carol and her husband, draws the reader into the depths of parental wipeout but without dragging the reader through detailed specifics of the author's own circumstance. It is, at the same time, a very personal and yet impersonal story. You &quot;see&quot; emotion and spiritual process and growth more than you &quot;see&quot; Jason or the courtroom, for example; in some ways Jason is representative of any &quot;heart sacrifice,&quot; any relinquished dream. (Unlike Abraham, the Kents have seen no miraculous and evident &quot;deliverance.&quot;Jason is serving a sentence of life in prison without parole.) &quot;When we release our grasp...It's an act of trusting God when we cannot envision a positive outcome. But in the end, it's the only thing that works.&quot; <br />  <br /> Carol's spiritual discussion in some chapters is supplemented by anecdotes tracing other people's faith journeys: a woman hearing that a husband has sexually abused a daughter, a single man losing the love of his life. The copyright page says some of these are &quot;true to life&quot; and included with permission; others are &quot;composites of real situations.&quot; This disclaimer made it hard for me to endow a few compelling anecdotes with real-character authenticity. <br />  <br /> Because of their nationwide ministry, the Kents have been &quot;upheld&quot; by a network of supportive &quot;stretcher bearers&quot; who have girded them in ways that may be enviable to the average reader. But I encourage the average reader to set aside that distinction and walk this journey alongside the author, who dares through darkness to hope in God's redemptive purposes --- some of which she can identify by the end of the book: &quot;If [we] had never endured unthinkable circumstances, we might not have understood the pain of brokenness.... If there had been 'a lamb in the thicket' for our family, we wouldn't have launched Speak Up for Hope,&quot; a new prison-related ministry. &quot;If life hadn't held unspeakable tragedy, we never would have been the recipients of such extravagant love.&quot; <br />  <br /> Each chapter ends with questions that help the reader process personal pain. To her credit, at the end of the book, Carol goes out of her way to establish that her pain is not necessarily greater than that of other people's losses. &quot;We don't need a meter to tell us which pain hurts the most. All of our heartaches produce great sadness, and telling our stories to each other brings a release, a comfort, and the knowledge that somebody cares.&quot; Most of all, she's newly aware of the love of God. &quot;I know He loves me more than I love my 'Isaac.'&quot; <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence <br />	2004-08-02

After the catastrophic drought in Los Angeles that affected all unbelievers, Stepola had met a man who changed his life and gave him the New Testament; Stepola also learned that his father had been an underground Christian. <br />  <br /> Now catastrophes are affecting some of Europe's most important cities. In order that the new, secular world government defeats a world-class terrorist, Styr Magnor, Stepola is sent in undercover to infiltrate the Christian underground in Europe. Headed by the charismatic and aloof Frenchman, Chappell Raison, these Christians have been living with the kind of fear and danger not seen in the West for centuries. Stepola needs to make them trust him while maintaining the trust of European authorities and his father-in-law --- who, unbeknownst to him, busily is manipulating Jae Stepola to spy on her husband. <br />  <br /> While the suspense aspect is interesting in itself, Jenkins ties in not just Paul Stepola's faith journey, but also his wife's, and this adds to the urgency. Will Jae, at first shocked and appalled by the idea of her husband's Christian heritage, care enough to investigate Christianity herself? What actions will Paul take, guided by his Scripture readings? Again, given the historical precedent for religious persecution, the premise of this series seems very real and very immediate, which makes the supernatural elements more plausible. <br />  <br /> Jenkins is a seasoned pro at mixing in the mundane (dinner details, children's roughhousing) with the sublime, so that this plausibility is maintained. Some of the dialogue is a little stilted --- but perhaps the author realizes this weakness, since when the talking gets rough, the characters get going; they're off into a new action before the reader has time to be distracted. The end of this novel came up quickly, yet leaves a lot for the next installment. Stay tuned. . . <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick <br />	2004-08-02

LIVING WATER is not a stereotypically lightweight, biblical novel. It's for readers who are ready for a challenge and willing to look for truths presented in nontraditional forms.<br />Author Obery Hendricks, a seminary \\"professor of biblical interpretation,\\" calls this, his first novel, \\"an African American retelling of the New Testament story of the woman at the well who was married to five successive husbands at a time when women did not have the right to choose either marriage or divorce.\\" Ethnic overtones are evident in some characters' nicknames (Sonny Boy and Big Mama) and patterns of dialogue (\\"Oh Lordy, we're in trouble now\\" and \\"Don't he talk sweet\\"). But there are deeper parallels: The ravages of slavery and harsh control influence the heart of the story --- the Samaritan men being humiliated and beaten down by the Romans; the women being powerless property of the husbands who have lost respect for themselves and take out their frustration on their women.<br />The book opens with a short, startling death scene of the Samaritan woman's fifth husband. Then Part 1 is a flashback, from prenuptial childhood up to that pivotal, bloody mess. She --- her name is Maryam, though significantly we aren't told this for 250 pages --- is a spunky, in-your-face kind of kid who sadly learns, from her kindhearted grandmother, Ma Tee, that spunk is not acceptable for girls. \\"Atop the coarse woolen tunic that is [the girl's] usual attire is now draped a stale, heavy garment of carefulness. Ma Tee has tried her best to craft it to her size, yet it does not fit. Still, she will dutifully struggle to wear it, though its weight will sag her heart to its knees.\\" And this narrative comment comes even before she's married to and beaten down by her first husband and abandoned by numbers two, three, and four.<br />This is a feminist story, but not drastically so; it is egalitarian more than man bashing. The big cast of characters --- five (or is it six?) husbands, three father figures, a brother-in-law, Messiah Jesus, and more --- include bad men and good; similarly with the Samaritan women. In a supplemental reader's guide, Hendricks explains that the Samaritan woman's journey \\"to be free of male domination and mistreatment was also my own journey to free myself from the roles of dominator and mistreater.\\"<br />Theologically conservative readers may rankle at some feminist theology, but, again, this is not as radical as it might be. Hendricks interprets biblical passages (mostly from Proverbs, once from Luke) that personify Wisdom (a feminine Hebrew word) as being descriptive of \\"the woman-side of God.\\"<br />For a novel that is replete with social commentary applicable to any age --- including a chapter on an itinerant, fraudulent faith healer --- LIVING WATER is an engaging read. Part 2 --- in which Maryam claims her name, takes up with a man who loves her and treats her well, and becomes a disciple of Jesus --- includes powerful scenes of redemption, even unto the last page, which drew a tear to my eye.<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-06-29

He writes that he was troubled that so many scripture verses in the Bible promised so much, yet so many Christians were mourning the death of their dreams. &quot;Has God been unfaithful to His promises?&quot; asks Atteberry. &quot;Do dreams really come true? And if so, what does it take to make them happen?&quot;<br />Atteberry went looking for answers. He found them, he believes, when he studied the life of Caleb, whom he calls &quot;The boldest dreamer and achiever in all of God's word.&quot; Writes Atteberry, &quot;I'm convinced that the main reason his story was included in Scripture is to show us that dreams really do come true, not just in Disney movies, but in real life.&quot;<br />When we look at the life of Caleb, we discover that fulfilled dreams are the result of clear thinking, strong faith, patience and lots of hard work, Atteberry writes. The key is taking a hard look at your dream and making sure it fits with God's will. &quot;Nothing...will help you if you've already committed to a course of action that puts you in opposition to God.&quot; He also cautions readers, with some humor, that God's blessings always harmonize with His gifts (&quot;If you're tone-deaf, you'll never be an opera singer. Rap maybe, but not opera.&quot;).<br />Atteberry is the minister of Poinciana Christian Church in Kissimmee, Florida, and the author of THE SAMSON SYNDROME. His passion for his topic in THE CALEB QUEST is contagious, and his first person writing is reminiscent of and is as well thought-out as a good sermon series. He mixes biblical narrative and interesting anecdotes, from art to baseball to crabbing. He also alludes to his own dream fulfillment, from his first attempts to write a novel eighteen years ago to becoming a published author. &quot;Don't ever tell me dreams don't come true,&quot; writes Atteberry, who then cautions, &quot;...they don't always come true when you want them to.&quot; Our timing for our dreams isn't always God's timing, he reminds us. Patience is called for. &quot;Our job is simply to be faithful in the meantime,&quot; he writes.<br />Atteberry devotes a chapter to the &quot;dream killers,&quot; pointing out that they are often our family members and our friends, and challenging readers to defeat them with courage and trust in the Lord. Of course our own worst enemy, he cautions, may be ourselves. &quot;Have you grown lazy? Are you hanging around with negative people?&quot;<br />There's a bit of THE PRAYER OF JABEZ tone to this book, and occasionally some of the sentences feel over-hyped: &quot;...you could be only a few pages away from finally understanding how to get from where you are to where you've always wanted to be&quot;). But readers will appreciate Atteberry's plea for them to be &quot;humble and teachable.&quot; &quot;The Caleb Quest is no pie-in-the sky prescription for wealth and happiness,&quot; he warns readers. &quot;It rejects the 'name it and claim it' theology that has left so many confused and discouraged. Instead, it offers a down-to-earth, biblical, workable plan for making your lifelong dream come true.&quot;<br />The jacket copy promises quite a bit (&quot;...this book will dramatically change your life...you'll finally discover what God wants you to know&quot; ) --- maybe too much. But the book ends on a lovely note: &quot;My dreaming friend,as you close this book and lay it down, I pray that you'll take up the Caleb Quest, and that someday, at the time of God's choosing, you'll see the fulfillment of your lifelong dream. But just as fervently, I pray that when it happens, you'll use it to bless others. If you do, I predict you'll make a startling discovery: that the giving away of your dream will bring you more joy than its fulfillment ever did.&quot;<br />Readers should find this an intriguing book, and questions for personal or group study should offer opportunity for additional perspective on what it means to dream big for God.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-27

A long-time bestselling author with an amazing story and a highly successful ministry, Tada outdoes her remarkable record with an autobiography that may be her best book so far.    The basics of Tada's life are well-known in Christian circles. Reared in a Christian home, Joni Eareckson was planning to enter Western Maryland College in the fall of 1967. But a trip to a Chesapeake Bay beach in July of that year permanently changed her life. A \\"simple\\" dive went wrong, and Joni ended up paralyzed from the neck down, confined to a wheelchair for life. In the following decade, Christians in America would become familiar with the once-unknown young woman who had learned to draw and paint with her mouth and was steadily producing a successful line of artwork sold in Christian stores. Her story was told in print and on film, and her voice later became a mainstay on Christian radio. In the intervening years, she has become an advocate for the disabled, not only in the United States but also around the world.    In no previous book has Joni Eareckson --- now married to Ken Tada --- been quite so transparent and open about the highs and lows of her relationship with God, particularly in the years immediately following the accident but also amid the day-to-day frustrations that come with being dependent upon others for the basic necessities of life. Through it all --- through the extraordinary accomplishments of someone who at one time had every reason to give up on life --- you get the sense that many of Tada's inner struggles are very ordinary, very human, and therefore very easy for others to relate to.    Tada writes about social issues, such as her firsthand experience with oppression in former communist countries, with as much sensitivity as she writes about highly personal issues, like her disappointment and sorrow after learning that she was infertile. She seamlessly intersperses detailed accounts of her many international trips with loving stories about her close-knit family, her circle of friends, and her marriage to Ken. Especially poignant are passages relating to the deaths of her mother and father.    Throughout, of course, the focus always returns to Tada's relationship with God and the subtle irony inherent in the subtitle, \\"A Lifetime of Walking with Jesus.\\" Even from her wheelchair, Tada \\"walks\\" with God. She writes, \\"Ah, this is the God I love. The Center, the Peacemaker, the Passport to adventure, the Joyride, and the Answer to all our deepest longings. The answer to all our fears, Man of Sorrows and Lord of Joy, always permitting what he hates, to accomplish something he loves...There are more important things in life than walking.\\"    Fans of Joni Eareckson Tada's previous books will not be disappointed with this one. It's a beautifully written tribute to the love of God as seen through the life of one woman who found freedom and joy in Christ in the midst of what another might consider a cruel confinement.	2004-06-27
US	30329810	R16DU116KS89CG	0842362398	468708674	In the Presence of My Enemies	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An Unforgettable Story Full of Grace, Mercy and Forgiveness	IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES is the true account of the horrendous ordeal that missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham endured after they were kidnapped by terrorists while celebrating their anniversary in May 2001. Held captive for a full year, the couple were within minutes of rescue when Martin was killed by \\"friendly fire\\" --- gunshots from their rescuers, who were soldiers in the Philippine army.    The skeletal story of the Burnhams' captivity and mistreatment at the hands of Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim extremist group active in the Philippines, is well-known to American audiences given the understandable media attention Gracia Burnham's release and homecoming generated. That story pales in comparison to the compelling account Burnham and veteran Christian author Dean Merrill provide in this book.    Whether due to Merrill's deft touch or Burnham's natural instincts, the two skillfully manage to avoid turning the memoir into a sensationalistic politic diatribe or melodramatic evangelistic treatise. The contributing elements were there: tireless workers on the foreign mission field enjoying one night of extravagance during their first real vacation in years, yanked from their cabin at gunpoint, subjected to horrific circumstances and conditions, with only one missionary left alive to tell the story. But Burnham and Merrill realized that the drama was inherent in the facts of the story, and any attempt to overdo it would have diluted the impact of Gracia's straightforward narrative.    The horror of what she experienced and witnessed during her year of captivity is difficult to fathom: beheadings, near-starvation, day-long marches that ended exactly where they began, forced \\"marriages\\" between captors and captives, even the fear that the Philippine army would make a rescue attempt --- a fear that proved to be well-founded with Martin Burnham's unnecessary death. And yet, Gracia relates the events of the year with such grace and skill that her story maintains a steady forward movement; she never stops the momentum by expressing outrage or analyzing the reasons why certain incidents occurred. What happened to the hostages on Sept. 11, 2001, for example, would have compelled a lesser person to rail against God and reject him completely, but Burnham --- who must still wonder about the timing of the events of that day --- seems to have come to terms with every aspect of her ordeal.    Perhaps the most surprising element of her story is the relationships that developed between the terrorists and the hostages. Their conversations were often friendly, and at times, the hostages realized that, in a sense, they were all on the same side, trying to avoid a deadly confrontation with the soldiers who were tracking them. In a particularly enlightening section, Gracia takes the reader into the mind of a terrorist who expressed genuine shock that the hostages thought they were being mistreated. Similarly, she recounts a conversation about the Koran in which her captor maintained that a verse condemning killing did not apply to him. Neither did an admonition against stealing.    Most of all, Burnham's account comes across as honest. She openly writes about those times when her faith in God vacillated, when her hope would turn to despair, and when the sheer boredom of the daily routine began to get to her. In short, her story rings true.    Burnham and Merrill deserve whatever honors and attention this book gets, because this is far more than a dramatic account of a momentous event --- it's an unforgettable story saturated with grace, mercy and forgiveness.	2004-06-27

For those of you who have never heard of him, he is an award-winning faith and sports columnist for the Akron Beacon Journal and the author of nineteen books. Among readers of the Beacon, he has a legion of fans. On a personal note, Pluto is the reason I subscribe to the Akron Beacon Journal, even though I am a major contributor to the Beacon's competitor, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer. Journalists like myself subscribe to the competition to know what they're up to. Not me. I buy to read Pluto. There, I've said it. With that out of the way, I can get down to business and tell you about his latest book EVERYDAY FAITH, a collection of fifty-seven of his &quot;Your Faith&quot; columns, published Saturdays in the Beacon's Religion section. I'm very familiar with each of the essays contained in this latest anthology. In fact, most of these columns I've clipped, saved, copied and shared with distant friends. They're that good.<br />They're good because he asks the questions we ask of God in the middle of the night, when we can't sleep. They're good because Pluto realizes that faith and living are inseparable and that it's faith that oftentimes makes living more understandable. They're good because he seeks answers on how it all fits together as we tuck our kids in bed at night, are called on to discipline an employee, deal with a sibling, handle grief or the death of a dream, or when we don't feel like praying. In his writing, Pluto works out his faith with &quot;fear and trembling,&quot; like the Good Book suggests, and we, who have the privilege to read him, are the beneficiaries.<br />In one essay titled &quot;Clergy: Your People Want To Know What Happens to Their Prayers,&quot; he challenges pastors, rabbis and imams to talk to their congregations about prayers that don't seem to get answered. Pluto writes: &quot;Your people...want to know they are not alone, that others also have had afeeling of dropping off God's radar screen. They're not so much angry as they are seeking hope. They want to know they still matter to God, and the trials they are facing will end and there is a purpose behind it.&quot; Pluto also tackles --- no, wait, tackles isn't the right word; he doesn't &quot;tackle&quot; issues, he merely leads the discussion.<br />Another essay is titled &quot;Where Is God When People Die?&quot; and brings out questions so many of us asked after 9/11: &quot;Where is God among the rubble and bodies? Where is God in the tears, the blood, the agony? Where is God when innocent people die, when it seems the world no longer makes sense?&quot; In less than 200 words, Pluto untangles evil and assures us that when we weep, so does God. He's not a preacher. He's a searcher, just like us.<br />Pluto weaves universal truths from simple questions, using down-home stories about people like you and me, pulling in quotes from area clergy to round it out and make his point. Scripture is quoted liberally. The biggest criticism I hear of his work among some of my Christian friends is that his columns are too basic and simplistic. But I say, &quot;Viva le Simplistic!&quot; Pluto doesn't pretend to be a theologian (though what he writes is theologically correct). He's real. He struggles. He questions. He ponders. And then he writes his heart out.<br />And we are so blessed because he does.<br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2004-06-27

Deriving its title from November 19, 1999 (11.19.1999), the &quot;last odd day&quot; until 3111, it is a quiet, rambling account of an older blue-collar woman coping with her husband's long-term care and her own long-term memories; it is more novella than novel and more a meditation than a narrative. However, while Jean Clover's story may not have the dramatic action or symbolic cohesion of Hinton's earlier work, it is nonetheless a lovely story replete with messages of faith, hope and charity.<br />The basic facts: Jean, daughter of a Cherokee woman and a blind white man, grows up poor and marries O.T., who almost immediately goes off to fight in World War II, leaving Jean home on the farm with his parents and brother. For many years, nothing much happens: O.T. works, Jean keeps house, and any disappointments either of them feel are either ignored or accepted --- until the day Jean learns that the child she has carried nearly to term has died in utero. After the grueling and gruesome experience of laboring in childbirth without a baby to take home, Jean runs away to a motel for a month, filling her room with infant clothes, toys, and paraphernalia until returning home quietly and carrying on as if nothing had happened.<br />The years pass, and the couple carry on as if nothing ever will happen --- until the day when O.T. is felled by a stroke and winds up in a nursing home at half his former size and with less than half of his former faculties. Jean visits and cares for him faithfully, and during one of her regular bedside stays, she learns from a caregiver that her husband has had another visitor. Jean's encounter with that person will change both of their lives.<br />It's not spoiling this book to reveal that O.T. had secrets; it would be spoiling the book, however, to give all of the details of what Jean does with her new knowledge. What is most fascinating about Jean'sreminiscences is that, despite the lack of luxuries in her life, she lacks neither love nor wisdom. When, at the end, her conventional church-lady neighbor attempts to tie up Jean's life, Jean resists with her customary stillness, knowing that some events and emotions cannot be reduced.<br />Hinton's achievement in THE LAST ODD DAY is a protagonist who will not be reduced, even if her circumstances and choices have made her a woman of little consequence for many people. Jean's dignity and decency are not contrived; Hinton seems almost to have channeled this character from a deep place, from the Godhead. But while Jean is a compelling character, the reader simply doesn't have enough information about her to understand her actions. Even at 192 pages, the book feels more like a character sketch than a narrative; yet such a moving and sincere character sketch should not be ignored.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-06-27

This time, though, the countdown is much nearer the eleventh hour, when the virus will begin to annihilate the world's population. Only by discovering the formula for the antivirus will the world be saved, and Hunter --- an unlikely hero with no background in chemistry --- may be the planet's only hope.    But Hunter doesn't need a scientific background. In fact, he needs little more than a good night's sleep to keep moving closer to finding the formula the world so desperately needs. As in BLACK, the first book in the trilogy, each time Hunter falls asleep in this dimension he wakes up in another dimension, a futuristic world that has only a fading memory of the events surrounding the release of the Raison Strain by terrorists willing to die in their pursuit of global power. In that dimension, Hunter seeks a long-lost history book chronicling the earlier events in this dimension. His pursuit of the book there mirrors his quest for the antivirus here.    As he draws nearer to finding what he is seeking, he acquires skills and information --- precious little at a time, it seems --- in the alternate dimension that carry over into this world to give him supernatural abilities and uncanny knowledge. That makes Hunter a very important man, both to the world leaders trying to avoid a global catastrophe and to the terrorists who have brought the world right to the brink of such a catastrophe. But for the first time, it appears as if the relationship between the two dimensions may not be as it originally seemed, setting up some intriguing possibilities for the final volume, WHITE, which releases in the fall.    Fans of Dekker will not be surprised to find that the author carries all this off with considerable skill. Hunter's life flows between the two dimensions so naturally that you don't even think twice about the probability that dream-like travel between two realities could exist. Dekker is equally adept at allowing the suspense to build through the progression of the events in the story; the build-up never feels forced or heavy-handed. And he makes sure that the beautiful Monique de Raison, whose company developed the vaccine that mutated into the deadly virus, needs to be rescued once again. Don't be surprised if you start to hear the theme music to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark in your head as you're reading one section of the book.    There's a third dimension in the trilogy, of course --- the spiritual dimension. In RED, the underlying Christian message is much more subtle than in BLACK, making this one a stronger book. Readers new to the trilogy should read the books in sequence, because RED won't make a lot of sense without the background that BLACK provides. As for those readers who have been eagerly awaiting the second book, rest assured --- you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-27

Amanda, or &quot;Lovey,&quot; is the vacuous, agnostic blonde Southern cheerleader whose dream marriage to football player Bo Tennyson has slipped away over the years into an expensive, polished façade. But can she confront Bo with the truth about their relationship? Tess Riley, the daughter of an Episcopal bishop, has become a successful writer with two Newbery Medals and three Horn Book Awards. But she keeps the truth about her identity a secret.<br />And Grace, the moral compass and &quot;truth teller&quot; of the foursome, believed in college that &quot;the truth will set you free...truth enables us to become the people we were created to be.&quot; But thirty years later, Grace is perhaps the worst at coming clean, spinning a fantasy life in the circle journal for her friends that bear no relationship to reality. Grace has been burned in the &quot;truth telling&quot; department before. Her parents' marriage had a dark side that she discovered after her father's death. It was then that truth ceased to be an abstract concept for Grace. As Stokes beautifully writes, truth then &quot;had a color, a taste, a smell. A dark red hellish light, a bitter burn like acid on her tongue, a scent of smoke and ash and the rotting remains of half-cremated dreams.&quot; Her mother tells her, &quot;We always think we want the truth, Grace. But the truth isn't always pleasant or noble, and it's certainly not painless.&quot;<br />Now, diagnosed with a terminal illness and long past believing her college credo that &quot;the truth will set you free,&quot; Grace must decide if she will finish life the same way she has lived it, or be willing to be painfully honest with her friends about her own deceptions and her need for a relationship.<br />Readers who dislike their authors deviating from what they have come to expect will enjoy CIRCLE OF GRACE, which echoes THE BLUE BOTTLE CLUB in its object motif and follows some familiar Stokes formulas. In this sense, CIRCLE OF GRACE is like settling in for a conversation with an old friend. However, more conservative Stokes fans will discover that the author has taken some risks in this novel: allowing her characters to use some profanity, and letting one of the friends &quot;come out of the closet.&quot; What is most unmistakable about this novel is how Stokes's writing, always proficient, sparkles in places, and she proves she knows how to turn some lovely phrases (&quot;Liz's questions, along with so many of her own, hung out there like loose threads on a badly-woven sweater.

The devotions are simple, usually beginning with a paragraph about something pertaining to golf, then a line or two making a spiritual correlation. In the last paragraph or two, Hopper drives his point home, lest the reader miss the application. There's nothing subtle here --- just straightforward good golf talk and ideas for deepening your spiritual life. From tee to green, he covers an admirable range of topics: sharing your faith, forgiving yourself on the golf course and learning from mentors in both life and in golf.<br />Admirably, Hopper tries to keep the book applicable to golfers of both genders, referencing both male and female golf legends. The book's content still has a masculine glaze to it (&quot;Men have one standard question they ask new partners on the golf course...&quot;), but it's appropriate for women as well.<br />This charming book is an accessible, light read, and its lovely packaging makes it perfect for gift-giving.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-27

As hosts of the nationally syndicated radio program \\"America's Family Coaches...Live!\\" they've heard myriad tales from wounded couples teetering on the brink of divorce, and have helped them put their marriages back together.<br />The authors believe that after the honeymoon fades and \\"the Novocain of naïveté wears off\\" many marriages suffer from unresolved conflict that causes hurt and anger. \\"If we do not learn to close the loop on our conflicts, our marriages will be at risk for sliding toward disconnection, discord, and possibly emotional divorce,\\" write the Rosbergs.<br />The book is salted with scriptural models for resolving conflict, diagrams, and anecdotal stories modeling problems with hurt and anger. There's Zach, who lets his mother run his life, and his wife Jan, whose anger over the situation is eating her up. Laura's husband is a workaholic, and she cries herself to sleep over his neglect. Jack works the night shift, and comes home unexpectedly to find his wife in the arms of a man from their Bible study group.<br />Every spouse will hurt their partner in some way, believe the Rosbergs. \\"It's not a question of if, only when.\\" What separates those who head for divorce court and those whose marriages last is how the couple will resolve the conflict and hurt that they feel, they believe. The Rosbergs see three things that keep couples moving in the right direction: the couple acknowledges that they will cause each other pain from time to time, the couple learns what to do when conflicts and pain occur, and the couple puts God's plan for resolving conflict into practice.<br />With this in mind, the Rosbergs give readers a biblically-based plan to carry out all three steps, beginning with the idea of \\"the loop.\\" The loop of conflict begins when your spouse offends you in some way. Until it is resolved, the loop remains open. At some point you reach the fork in the road --- the choice to close the loop or leave it open. Once forgiving love is exercised, the loop is closed.<br />Forgiving love, as seen by the Rosbergs, is a six-stage process: preparing the heart, diffusing anger, communicating concerns, confronting, forgiving, and rebuilding trust. Each stage is explored in detail, and includes examples of couples working through that particular step. Although the Rosbergs encourage couples to say no to divorce, they are also realistic, giving some examples of couples who don't make it. \\"Reconciliation can occur only when both spouses want it and pursue it through whole forgiveness.\\"<br />The Rosbergs also look at the origins of marital conflicts, including family background differences, personality differences, values differences, and differences between the sexes. They also examine various types of anger (situational, displaced) and our responses to anger (protecting ourselves, exploding, denying, stuffing). Healing is hampered when pride, guilt, laziness, shame, and fear throw a \\"red light\\" that stops us on our journey toward resolution, they write.<br />\\"Unless you and your spouse learn how to work through your hurt and anger, you will likely find yourself on an emotional roller coaster that never slows down,\\" write the authors. \\"Unresolved anger evolves into bitterness and resentment.\\" The unresolved conflicts are part of the \\"open loops,\\" and closing every \\"loop\\" as soon as possible is vital to divorce-proofing your marriage, they write.<br />They also examine cultural messages about conflict resolution, including messages from the media, advice from friends and family members, and instructions given by the church. Some of the most enjoyable illustrations in the book are whencharacters from the television sitcom \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" are used to illustrate five common conflict resolution styles. The couple writes with one voice, occasionally switching to first person accounts when they share personal marital anecdotes, which makes for a smooth read. Their plan for resolving conflict and managing anger and hurt flows in an orderly and logical way, with plenty of subheads to help the reader stay on track.<br />With virtually no Christian extended family left untouched by divorce, the Rosbergs have a ready-made readership. Engaged couples will find this book a great discussion starter, and married couples could find it a marriage-saver.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-27

His journey isn't straightforward linear reading. Rather, DeVries swirls together a kaleidoscope of observations, images, angst, poem fragments and quotes that are best taken in small bites rather than gulped.<br />DeVries grew up the son of evangelical Christian missionaries, where God was as much a part of life as breathing.<br />all my life I've heard about salvation, how it can find us only when we need it the most. I've heard about brokenness and how God can heal us only when we're breaking apart and small.

He expresses gut-wrenching vulnerability, although some passages flirt with self-absorption.<br />some days I hold on to sadness because it's my only comfort. it's there when everyone else goes away, and I'm lonely then but not as much as when they dismiss me when I need their empathy the most.<br />Yet, readers who have experienced the same unrelenting dark night of the soul will forgive him for these moments as they empathize with DeVries' agonized, candid observations on suffering and his wrestling with doubt.<br />all my life I've heard about salvation, how it can find us only when we need it the most. I've heard about brokenness and how God can heal us only when we're breaking apart and small. I've known this but not that it would happen to me and not that it could feel so much like pain or that need could feel so much like despair.<br />In his search for authenticity as a creative writer and musician of faith, DeVries discovers that:<br />we think that the farther we go into the spiritual life the more we will fit the mold of someone who has the right to be here. but our position was always a gift to begin with and nothing is changed about that now. we're still little children, but at least we have a place to belong.<br />DeVries refreshingly eschews easy answers. His courageous exploration of the darker side of faith should resonate with readers looking for a companion to walk alongside them on their own journeys through the dark night of the soul to the light of God's love.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-07

The couple, living on the Stiles farm, couldn't be happier. Nothing is missing.<br />Or so they might think (although, as the novel makes clear, Maggie knows better all along). But when tragedy strikes (their baby boy is stillborn and Maggie lapses into a postnatal coma), Dylan finds himself alone in a desert. At first he is unwilling to accept the kindness of strangers, but soon he finds that kindness --- from strangers and friends alike --- is all he has for the moment.<br />Slowly Dylan begins to fashion a post-childbirth life: his friend Amos, the town sheriff, convinces him to take a proffered job at the local community college teaching English 101. (Amos is African-American and Dylan is Caucasian; they've evidently been known as &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; for decades). Dylan, the taste of his doctoral training still sour in his mouth, balks at leaving his comfortable farming existence, but Amos shows him that it was Maggie herself who knew that Dylan needed more than plowing, tilling and harvesting in his life.<br />Characters as specifically drawn as Maggie (with her firm devotion), Amos and the utterly singular Bryce Kai MacGregor make this soft-spoken debut novel a must-read. MacGregor is a bagpipe-wielding, beer-swilling, trailer-inhabiting layabout with a heart bigger than his enormous trust fund. And the bookended characters of Amanda and Koy, both Dylan's students and both faced with similar burdens, offer a perspective on single motherhood not often found in Christian literature, yet at the same time not in conflict with the aims of that literature. Meanwhile, Dylan finds that teaching again both sparks his interest and kindles problems, since his students' reasons for taking composition are as varied as their ethnic backgrounds.<br />In the slow weeks that follow Maggie's confinement, Dylan finds that, like his diverse classroom, people have different ways of showing him hope: Amos takes him fishing, while Amanda invites him to her church. In a run-of-the-mill Christian novel, that invitation might be the dénouement of the book --- but Martin's own literary training (he has a Ph.D. from Regents University) serves him well. He presents Dylan's acceptance of Jesus Christ as one step in his spiritual pilgrimage --- the most important step, but not the only step, not the final step.<br />Thus, the actual dénouement does not seem as pat as it might in the hands of a lesser writer. Although it takes a second tragedy to open Dylan's eyes and heart to grace, these events happen fluidly, not awkwardly. One can easily imagine reading more about Dylan Stiles, and yet the best thing about THE DEAD DON'T DANCE is that you don't need to read more about Dylan Stiles. His story and Maggie's has been told, and told well. In subsequent novels, Martin will no doubt find that his talent for creating vivid characters means that he can allow them, rather than dramatic events, to bring meaning to his words.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-06-06

It was there that he lived and taught music when he could have spent his life in relative ease in Nashville, the center of the Christian music industry. He constantly defied convention, especially the Christian convention of the American evangelical variety.    When Mullins, best known for the contemporary praise song \\"Awesome God\\" and \\"Sing Your Praise to the Lord,\\" recorded by Amy Grant, died in an automobile crash in September of 1997, his fans and colleagues felt a genuine sense of loss. This wasn't the passing of a superstar; it was the loss of a man who surrendered his life in service to God and verbally expressed his unqualified devotion to him through the utterly stunning poetry of his lyrics and the candor of his off-the-cuff observations about the cultural Christian lifestyle and mindset.    Mullins didn't always say what people liked to hear, but he always spoke from his heart. The same can be said about his writing. Seriously, how many Christians do you know who would have the guts to accuse God of playing hard to get --- and ask it in a song, for millions to hear? (That song is appropriately titled \\"Hard to Get,\\" by the way.) That same kind of honesty appeared in the always perceptive columns Mullins wrote for Release magazine in the early 1990s. Which brings us to THE WORLD AS I REMEMBER IT, a compilation of those columns.    Now I could be wrong about this, but it seems to me that this book is a repackaging of an earlier book called HOME, released several years after Mullins's death by Voxcorp, which owned Release. The columns may be the same as those published in HOME, but I no longer have access to that book to double-check. At any rate, this one is an entirely different design, published in a small, gift-book format with dozens of beautiful sepia-toned photos of Mullins and the places that were significant to him.    The main attraction, though, is Mullins's masterful writing. The same elegance that he brought to his lyrics is evident in his prose. It didn't matter whether he was writing about the lilies and the sparrows Jesus mentioned in the Sermon on the Mount or about growing older or even about fiddles --- profound truth and mundane objects were equal sources of wonder for him. He could glean as much insight from his attic apartment renovation as he could from the rich poetry of Proverbs 30. Every one of his columns is well worth reading. Readers who were familiar with Mullins's work when he was alive will no doubt be able to see his face and hear his voice again as they read the treasures he left behind in print.    The negative? There's only one. Reading the words he wrote may make you miss him even more.	2004-06-06

Nothing, that is, until Pop --- Trev's grandfather --- is suddenly taken ill. Pop and his wife Honey raised Dori from the time she was seven and left orphaned when her parents were killed in a drunk driving accident. Dori packs her bags to go back East, little realizing that the suitcase she takes off the luggage carousel at her journey's end will be someone else's --- someone who will stop at nothing to get that suitcase back.<br />When Dori is reunited with Honey and Pop, a pitifully ill Pop extracts a promise that she and Trev will live together as husband and wife for the next six months. Unable to say no to him in his condition, Dori and Trev agree. Soon, Dori discovers the hard-drinking Trev who she left years ago was so devastated by her desertion that he has turned to God --- and become a pastor. Suddenly Dori sees Trev with new eyes, &quot;wonderful, tall and strong, full of character and depth, a man worth knowing.&quot;<br />Wooed by Trev's romantic courting, Dori finds her anger at Trev's imagined past misdeeds beginning to dissipate. She discovers that Trev has taken in Ryan, a 13-year-old boy whose grandmother and caretaker is hospitalized and unable to run Harbor Lights, the Christian bookstore. Wanting to help Ryan's grandmother, she takes the neglected business under her wing.<br />Trouble is simmering just under the surface. Trev has his hands full with Bob, a member of his church who has left his wife and small children for Penni, &quot;all wide eyes and hard edges.&quot; When Trev tells Bob and Penni they can no longer participate in church-sponsored activities until they end their adulterous affair, Bob threatens to raise questions about Dori and Trev's marriage that could cost Trev his job as pastor of Seaside Chapel. Meanwhile, the suitcase of stolen goods remains with Dori at Trev's house, and the thieves plot how to retrieve it.<br />Fans of the &quot;gentle read&quot; will appreciate such evasions as &quot;...Dori knew she and Trev had the proverbial snowball's chance in that eternal hot place&quot; and other conservative prose handlings that make for a squeaky clean read. Readers will need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story; the premise that Dori and Trev would be married for only a few days and then live apart for six years, all because of a slight misunderstanding, may be a stretch for some. Some characters are one-dimensional --- Vinnie is the stereotypical criminal, and Joanne the cliché moll whose naiveté readers will recognize from any gangster movie.<br />Yet the pacing is pleasant, many of the characters are enjoyable (churchgoers will quickly realize &quot;the three Graces&quot;) and there are surprises that help keep the pages turning. Although this can be read as a stand-alone book, readers may want to begin with the first installment, SPRING RAIN, followed by SUMMER SHADOWS and AUTUMN DREAMS.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-06

Lewis's THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, for, like those two great thinkers and writers, Smith has attempted to give a view of Heaven less significant for its literal truth and more so for its metaphorical richness. His protagonist Tim Hudson &quot;has finally arrived at God's address,&quot; we're told --- in other words, he's in despair. His beloved and physically challenged toddler daughter has died in a &quot;senseless medical accident&quot; and his closest friend in Christ, a musician, has been killed in an auto accident. Tim has thus found his way to &quot;God's address&quot; in time-honored fashion, through human agony.<br />Tim is blessed enough and resourceful enough not to wind up staring at the bottom of an empty glass, or worse. Instead, he signs up for a week-long silent retreat at an Episcopal monastery in Massachusetts. When he checks in, he finds he has been assigned a spiritual director --- much to his chagrin. The lean Brother Taylor, sporting sweats and running shoes beneath his habit, rankles Tim, who thinks he can solve his problems by himself, as long as he has some time and space to think about them.<br />But Brother Taylor not only quickly finds Tim's weakest spots --- he finds a place in Tim's subconscious, too. For one night Tim goes to bed and has a dream different from any other, in which multiple figures (from his imagination, his education and his background) lead him to places of great beauty, meaning and spirituality. A shadowy lion evokes Lewis's Aslan, from The Chronicles of Narnia; Lewis himself (here known by his earthly moniker of &quot;Jack&quot;) brings Tim to a new level ... and so on, and so forth. A long-lost relative appears, as does his dead mother --- all of which sounds very kitschy and schtick-y.<br />Yet it's not. Smith, who is Chaplain and Assistant Professor of Theology at Wichita's Friends University, hascrafted a deceptively simple and psychologically clever read about the things --- thing, really --- that matter most to Christian faith. Those devoted to denominational dogma and humdrum should check their baggage at Tim's bedside since, like the pre-Protestant Dante Alighieri and the confirmed Anglican Clive Staples Lewis, Smith also cares more about the Christ-centered than the church-centered. Every object, character and sensation Tim encounters during his lucid dream revolves around love: love given, taken, rejected, fulfilled.<br />Smith's small novel is the work of a big mind. If the comparisons to Dante and Lewis are a bit overblown on the literary front, they may not be on the theological front. There are many sincere Christians who believe that &quot;apologetics&quot; is wrong-minded, either as a defense of a faith (its common definition) or as over-intellectualization of what should come to us from the Holy Spirit. But in the hands of a mature Christian, when apologetics shows one fine person's struggle from the depths of despair back to firm knowledge of God's abiding presence and love --- well, it's a marvelous thing indeed.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-06-06

When does belief cross the lines into legalism?<br />In this fast-paced, well-executed story, Randy Singer pens the troubling tale of Thomas and Theresa Hammond, two radically conservative Christians who belong to a church where seeking medical attention is viewed as sinful, and sickness comes from a lack of faith. When their toddler son Joshie becomes critically ill, they delay seeking medical attention. Joshie dies, and unscrupulous deputy attorney Rebecca Crawford (a.k.a. \\"the Barracuda\\") seizes the incident as a way to garner media attention and boost her chances of career advancement. The devastated parents are charged with negligent homicide and their remaining two children are taken from them. Charles Arnold, a divorced African-American law professor and street preacher who has recently been victimized by racial profiling, reluctantly takes the white Hammond couple's case.<br />But there's more, of course, going on than meets the eye. The married doctor who failed to save Joshie has a checkered past and a suspicious relationship with Crawford. During a night spent unjustly in jail sparked by his street preaching, the endearing Arnold rubs shoulders with a criminal awaiting trial who could be a key player in the Hammond case. Singer salts surprise twists for the reader throughout almost every chapter.<br />Singer, a street preacher and trial lawyer, knows firsthand many of the things he writes about, and has the craftsman's ability to bring his knowledge alive on the page in a way that makes for believable, exciting fiction. As the story unfolds, Singer weaves in multiple sub-themes, including racial discrimination, greed and betrayal. In the end, it is one person's \\"dying declaration\\" --- the statement made before a person dies that is almost always true and admissible as evidence --- that tips the outcome.<br />One of Singer's strengths is his multifaceted characters. He paints Theresa and Thomas as flawed Christian characters who are in need of the knowledge of God's grace, and the reader, while appalled at the Hammonds' actions involving Joshie, finds the couple believable and worthy of sympathy. Arnold is engaging and conflicted, and his romance with special advocate Nikki Moreno and his concern for her lack of faith are penned with a deft touch. The portrayal of the Hammonds' middle child, \\"Tiger,\\" provides some memorable moments as he struggles to understand what has happened to his parents and his little brother. The only disappointment in characterization is with Crawford, who readers will love to hate and who rather unbelievably fails to show some endearing trait or glimmer of decency.<br />Although he never crosses the line into sentimentality, Singer also knows how to pluck at the heartstrings, and poignant moments throughout the story are sure to evoke a tear or two. The point of view changes are handled with aplomb. Strong pacing keeps the pages turning, as does the hooks at the end of each chapter that make it difficult to put the book down.<br />Singer, a 2003 Christy Award winner for suspense, gets better with each subsequent novel, and he excels in DYING DECLARATION. Fans of Singer's earlier novels, IRREPARABLE HARM and DIRECTED VERDICT will recognize some of the characters that make appearances in DYING DECLARATION, although it reads beautifully as a stand-alone novel.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-06-06

Intertwined with their slow love story was the tale of church-hopping single South Carolingians, all loosely led on a beach vacation by surfer dude Ransom and his toothsome wife Jamie (the only couple in either book allowed more than chaste kisses). Blackston now has a second novel out, A DELIRIOUS SUMMER, and as promised, many of the same characters appear again in this book.<br />Jay and Allie are not center stage this time, although they do figure prominently in the book's second half (more on that shortly). This time around (the story here takes place the following summer), the protagonist is Neil Rucker, a missionary on furlough from Ecuador, where one of the least-promising students in his Spanish class was Jay Jarvis. Neil, who doesn't quite believe he's a missionary because he &quot;just teaches,&quot; is both footloose and an orphan; he isn't quite sure where he should land once on the more familiar ground of the United States. Jay, whose instincts are better than his language skills, convinces Neil to try Greenville, SC and sets him up with a church singles group --- Steve as his roommate, Darcy of the lime-green Cadillac convertible and Alexis of the silver piercings as his &quot;bait.&quot; (Several characters and Blackston are really into fishing, so it's no surprise that male-female goings-on in this book sometimes feel like a session with lures, tackle and reels.)<br />Blackston has brought his inimitable and delightful humor back to this novel. While most of the action revolves around the Presbyterians, no denomination is left unskewered. For example, a Methodist service is described as &quot;a sermon and some hymns and some protocol,&quot; an Episcopalian service as &quot;a sermon and some hymns and some ceremony,&quot; and aPentecostal service as &quot;a sermon and some hymns and some aerobics.&quot; Blackston doesn't take religious trappings too seriously, and neither do the Ladies of the Quest, Greenville's young single women trolling for potential husbands: they will attend any church so long as the single male pickings are good. When they're not, these supposedly innocent maidens move on to the next --- and the next, and the next (you might get Jell-O salad with the Baptists, croissants with the Episcopalians, and pudding with the Lutherans --- it really is potluck in Greenville).<br />The plot goes something like this: Neil takes his furlough in Greenville, begins to meet and greet the various young ladies of the Quest, and bonds with his fellows in the singles group. They take another beach vacation, which involves a long, hot trip in Darcy's Caddy and some annoyances along the way that bond Neil and Alexis, who recognize each other as kindred spirits. Neil also bonds with the frick-and-frack team of Maurice and Asbury on the latter's boat, and take an unforgettable fishing trip that serves mainly to introduce some characters who will aid Jay and Allie's Ecuadorian mission during a hard time.<br />If I don't spend a great deal of time on the story, that's because it seems less important than Blackston's detailed, unique characters --- and because what seems most important about these characters is that they build community. Whether they're in a South American city, the rainforest, on a beach or in a parish hall, they take each other as they are and find ways to love each other.

Kaye, gentle romantic spirit like Rosamond Pilcher, and family interaction like Jodi Picoult. In this book, three characters (two living, one dead) alternate telling the story.<br />San Francisco reporter Claire O'Rourke is a young woman who has returned to her hometown of Harper's Bay ostensibly for a visit, but winds up staying and taking a job at The Tidal Post when family circumstances change. As she settles into what turns out to be a much-needed change of pace, her path crosses with that of Sophia Fleming, a once-lauded and now-reclusive author in her seventies who lives on a small island off the coast. The character of Josephine Vanderook speaks from the pages of a saltwater-encrusted diary that Sophia finds in a rock pool on her morning walk.<br />Soon the voices of these three women are creating a sort of call-and-response in their alternating pages. Although Claire, Sophia and Josephine have many differences, their common threads of loving words and writing as well as their devotion to God begin to bind them together and lessen differences of time, age and circumstance. Sophia, who has been hoarding the diary to herself rather than give it to the town museum, finds that the new young woman on the scene seems very familiar to her, and when she allows Claire in to her home and read the diary pages, the faith of the two modern women is contrasted with their historical counterpart.<br />Martinusen's central message seems to be that everyone's path to faith --- Claire's, Sophia's, Josephine's --- takes a different course. Some of the &quot;big city, little city&quot; contrast is overdone, and some of the characters, like the latte-brewing &quot;Cap'n Charlie,&quot; seem a little too quaint. But the friendship between Sophia and Ben that blossoms into romance, despite some very real present-day and past obstacles, is beautifully drawn, as is the &quot;romance&quot; of working at an old-fashioned, slow-going but industrious newspaper for Claire. As Claire begins a relationship with town artist Griffin and her family faces a crisis surrounding her brother and a little girl he is protecting, Ben is facing a tough choice about retirement and Sophia seems almost lost in her solitude.<br />Yet the strongest element of this book has less to do with character details and plot points than it does with the author's own spiritual grace. On her Web site, when asked what she hopes to accomplish through her writing, Cindy says, &quot;I definitely always want to glorify God in my writing. I don't want to lose touch with that --- to get so into the writing that I lose the fact that this is God's calling.

The sequel to AIN'T NO RIVER is every bit as entertaining and insightful as its predecessor, which ended up on the Essence bestseller list --- not a bad showing at all for a book released by a Christian publisher.    Like all of Foster's books, one of the main strengths is the characterization. You'll be reading along, completely caught up in the story, and all of a sudden you'll think of someone who acts just like this character or sounds just like that character. And most likely, you'll chuckle, because Foster has a knack for injecting humor into her characterizations with such finesse and subtlety that it often sneaks up on you and catches you off guard.    The central characters in this book are Mary, a chaste, somewhat meek woman who undergoes a radical makeover at the insistence of friends who are determined to find her a man; Moor, an African prince (the setting for all this is Baltimore, by the way) whose American \\"fathers\\" --- elderly friends --- are equally determined to find him a wife; and Puddin, whose marriage is threatened by a secret that nearly tears her apart. Each is a fully developed, believable character. And Foster takes as much care with the peripheral characters --- friends, coworkers and family ---as she does in developing the main characters.    Each chapter focuses on a different character, alternating among the three central characters. This type of structure doesn't always work, but once again Foster shows her strength as a writer by doing it right. Actually, if Foster has a weakness, it's not evident in the final product. Maybe she struggles with certain elements of writing, but if she does, she gets it worked out before the book is published --- which certainly isn't the case with all writers. She's also one ofthe strongest dialogue writers among Christian novelists. Can you tell I really enjoy reading her books?    AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN tackles a fair number of issues, like sex outside of marriage and pornography --- and dating, a seemingly innocuous subject that is all but innocuous in Foster's hands. Any woman who has ever seriously dated --- and I mean dated --- will cringe at the memories evoked by Mary's dates with Floyd and Reggie, two guys whose counterparts live in every city, every town, every neighborhood across the country. Thanks to Floyd, I may never eat ribs again, which brings up another point: It's a good idea to read this book on a full stomach, because food --- especially fried chicken --- plays a significant role. It's not just there as a tantalizing temptation; it's actually central to one of the subplots.    As to the Christian content, Foster can get downright preachy, but somehow she gets by with it --- probably because of the skill with which she integrates that content into the story line. It never comes across as tagged on just to make the book appealing to Christian readers, but instead is carefully woven into the relevant scenes.    If you're new to Foster, there's no need to read any of her previous books first to enjoy this one. Fans of AIN'T NO RIVER will recognize several familiar characters in AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN, but this is not the kind of sequel that requires reading the books in order. No matter how you read them, Foster's books are always a delight.	2004-06-06

The difference? From the perspective of empty-nest, middle age, he sees that one cannot understand grace &quot;without understanding sin.&quot;<br />After two introductory chapters grounded in his epiphanic reaction to the Prodigal Son parable and painting, McMinn looks at sin from three perspectives: theology, psychology and spirituality. Noting the problems with a prevalent, secular &quot;I'm OK, you're OK&quot; mindset and a judgmental &quot;I'm OK, you're a mess&quot; stance, he concludes that it's wiser and more realistic, albeit countercultural, to admit, &quot;I'm a mess, you're a mess.&quot; The voice of this humble stance draws the reader in; it turns what could have been an analytical book into an insightful, refreshing read. Through revealing (but not too) personal anecdotes, McMinn, the professor and expert, becomes a fellow traveler. &quot;Our greatest hope is going through a long, slow process of understanding our messes, acknowledging our part in the problem, then seeking resolution and restoration.&quot;<br />Being a psychologist, not a theologian, his insights get better as the book progresses, but early on he does lay out good distinctions among three dimensions of sin: sinfulness, the &quot;white noise&quot; of original sin that &quot;touches every aspect of our existence&quot;; sins, the choices we make to &quot;violate God's instruction&quot;; and the consequences of sin, our own and others'. The point of this synopsis? &quot;Only as we begin to grasp the immensity of the sin problem are we able to glimpse the depth of God's grace, and paradoxically, seeing God's grace gives us courage to face our sinfulness.&quot;<br />Much of part 2, &quot;The Damage Report,&quot; which discusses the psychological perspective of sin, hones in on pride, &quot;the utmost evil,&quot; according to C. S. Lewis --- how it wreaks havoc in our passions (&quot;in our pride we love and hate the wrong things,&quot; writes McMinn) and also in our minds (&quot;pride taints our thinking as well as our affections&quot;). McMinn then spends a chapter acknowledging that we are not sinful trash but rather &quot;noble ruins&quot; --- made in the image of God.<br />Part 3, &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; draws us toward God and the grace he offers --- through himself and through people working on his behalf --- notably as we admit our sinfulness and sins. The best lines in the book may be those under the heading &quot;Repentance and Forgiveness&quot;: &quot;Time does not heal all wounds. Time heals clean wounds. Soiled wounds fester and infect, leading to bitterness and cynicism, to terrorism and war, to divided marriages and wounded children ...<br />&quot;When we humbly admit our weaknesses and faults to God and to one another, we create the possibility for the intimacy we long for and we catch a glimpse of heaven.&quot;<br />It's hard to categorize this book. It is not self-help or how-to. Nor is it heavy theology (for all the talk of sin and grace, there isn't much technical talk of the Atonement). Nor is it a devotional. This is not a book for or of interest to men more than women. (Having said that, I note that in seven pages of endnotes, McMinn cites only two women; surely this says something about our fallen world, though it's hard for me to articulate what.)<br />Like the works of Henri Nouwen, WHY SIN MATTERS is a thoughtful, insightful nudge toward spiritual andpsychological growth. It could well complement pastoral or clinical therapy. Its insights will be valuable for anyone who has sung John Newton's &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and resonated with or has conversely been repulsed by its most difficult phrase: &quot;a wretch like me.&quot;<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-06-06

But Doug has two secrets: he's addicted to Internet pornography and he visits strip clubs. The club is located on the opposite end of the same street as his home --- Tenth Street, hence the book's title --- both physically and metaphorically.<br />Working at the strip club is waitress Ronnie Hanover, a young, naïve runaway who has followed her friend to Atlanta to get away from an abusive home life. The moment Doug walks through the strip club's doors, his life becomes intertwined with Ronnie and the seamy goings-on of the club's management. As Doug's secret life is busted wide open by a friend he knows from church, he discovers that he's being blackmailed at work.<br />Shaunti Feldhahn's latest book takes us behind the scenes of the pornography industry, an issue plaguing many men and their families sitting in many church pews. Not the type of nice-nice stuff that usually shows up in Christian lit. But writing about Internet porn addiction is a completely natural transition for a writer like Feldhahn, whose last book, THE VERITAS CONFLICT, dealt with, in her own words, \\"real life as a Christian --- the real, daily battles that all of us face in our secular culture.\\" Some experts estimate that 1 out of 3 Christian men struggle with pornography addiction.<br />What makes this book interesting is that Feldhahn introduces us to both the world of the addict and the world to which those addicts are addicted, and makes us see that those two worlds are intimately connected. In the epilogue, Feldhahn writes, \\"Before I began this book, I had never given much thought to the sex industry, believing --- as many of us do --- that it was not touching me or my community personally. It just didn't seem to intersect my suburban, comfortable life in any way. What I didn't realize was that this industry impacts all of us in both subtle and pervasive ways, whether we are aware of it or not.\\"<br />Pornography and strip clubs are hard subjects to write about in generalities. There's no getting around the fact that both involve sex, women taking their clothes off on a stage, using provocative and suggestive movements and sexual favors granted outside the club. It's just the way it is. Feldhahn does a remarkable job setting the strip club scene without teetering on the titillating and crossing that fine line between informing and ensnaring.<br />Of course, I read the book as a woman, from a woman's perspective and was impressed with the way Feldhahn seemed to get into Doug's head, letting us see things from a man who is trying to make a break from pornography. I can drive down the highway and not look twice at a provocative billboard. Men, on the other hand, can't.<br />I didn't know that.<br />But the book's underlying message hit home with me for another reason: someone I love recently discovered that her husband is addicted to pornography and visiting strip clubs. My friend and her husband, like our fictional couple, Doug and Sherry, are devout Christians and looked upon by everyone that knows them as \\"the perfect couple.\\" But when my friend discovered her husband's addiction, there was a lot of crying and sleepless nights. For lack of a better way to describe how ticked she was, she wanted to kill him. In Feldhahn's book, however, when Sherry finds out about Doug's illicit activities, she is shocked and cries a little, but then seems to become this \\"super-holy-human-being\\" of understanding and forgiveness. It is at this point that Feldhahn lost me; her reaction reminded me that I was reading fiction.<br />From that point on, too many scenes and too much dialogue begin to sound wooden and like articles Feldhahn might have read while doing research. After some passages, I actually asked myself, \\"Who talks like that?\\" All of it was information that moved the story line but so much of it didn't ring true, which is too bad. You can tell Feldhahn poured her heart and soul into this book and its subject matter is timely and important to many \\"head-in-the-sand-churches\\" who would rather send their congregations out to picket adult book stores than minister to those affected by them.<br />Feldhahn's book sheds light on a problem too many consider to be \\"private\\" and none of anyone else's business. Instead, she demonstrates that premise is wrong.<br />Yesterday, I sent a copy of this book to my friend who I mentioned above. After she reads it, she has told me that she will pass it on to another friend who just discovered her husband is also addicted to pornography, who asked her if she could pass it on to another friend who's going through the same thing with her husband.<br />Clearly, it's the right book for a lot of women.<br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2004-05-17

Years ago, as a youth coming up from a hardscrabble existence in St. Augustine, Florida, Taylor found employment with the Revell family on their yacht --- and fell in love with their beautiful, headstrong daughter Kirra.<br />As the novel opens and all throughout its pages, Bunn weaves in Taylor's surfing adventures. While I occasionally found my eyes rolling back in my head at some of the detailed descriptions of waves and surfer moves, this is certainly stuff I haven't read about before --- it gives Bunn a great way to take Taylor from the Old City of St. Augustine to the rough Oban coast in Scotland on down to French Basque seaside territory. More on that in a moment.<br />But back to Taylor and the Revell family. Just as he realizes that the takeover seems a little funny, Kirra's sister Amanda contacts him and tells him that she wants him to find her sister, who has gone missing. Since the Revells --- particularly father Jack, but Amanda as well --- loathe Taylor, he is suspicious. However, Amanda pulls him in by saying that Kirra asked for him. Before you can say &quot;setup,&quot; Taylor is off to Florida and his boyhood home. Once there, memories threaten to overwhelm him, and Ada Folley, the multiracial neighbor who raised him in many ways, has taken him to task for a past deed that broke Kirra's heart.<br />However, Taylor's memories are nowhere near as threatening as the goons who overpower him and leave him to die in the city's underground tunnels. Of course we know that Taylor, child of the St. Augustine streets, will make it out, but it costs him a great deal physically to do so, and that's not his last brush with injury. However, he does get a lead that Kirra is or was in Scotland, and so he flies, rides and hikes his way out to the tiny island of Iona, home of an ancient monastery known as a &quot;thin place&quot;: that is, the bond between humanity and divinity is very thin there.<br />As I write this, my own pastor and his wife are planning their July sabbatical trip to Iona because they want to deepen their faith journey together --- that's how powerful a place this is, and so it is fitting that Bunn chooses Iona as the site of Taylor's slow spiritual awakening (begun years before by Ada but never achieved as Taylor made his way in the world).<br />Taylor's &quot;pilgrim's progress&quot; might seem too slick and quick for some, but for others who have said their own &quot;few words&quot; (as Bunn describes Taylor on a seaside promontory giving his life over to Jesus) it will be quite believable. Woven throughout is the story of Taylor's communications with his secretary, Allison, a single mother who is trying to hold things together at home while helping Taylor stay one step ahead of Amanda Revell and company. The rest of the novel moves quickly from Scotland to Basqueland, but the ending holds some surprising --- and sweet --- results.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-05-17

After all, she is 31 --- much older than Arin, resident cutie-patootie of The Reasons, their church singles group --- and all of Ashley's alarm clocks --- biological, marital and spiritual --- are ticking loudly.<br />It doesn't help that Ashley (who wonders why her mother didn't name her after Rhett or Scarlett instead) has an unchurched family, a &quot;Smug Married&quot; best friend, and a boss named Purvi who is seemingly impervious to anything that doesn't resemble work --- she even has Ashley run out to take her nine-year-old son to school rather than leave her desk. (When Ashley tells him that his mom said how much she missed him, he replies: &quot;My mom didn't say that. . .She's working on new patents which are critical to the success of Selectech. It's imperative that she be allowed to pursue her work. Family would, of course, become secondary at this time when her presence at the company is so vital.&quot;)<br />Ashley sits home too many weekends and is thoroughly tired of the second-tier activities her singles group plans (from chain-restaurant lunches to geek-movie viewings). Billerbeck has a keen, fresh perspective on the singleton sturm-und-drang that fuels the myriad Chick Lit titles out now in Helen Fielding's wake; like Bridget Jones, Ashley Stockingdale wants more from her life. Like Bridget, Ashley wonders how best to get it, and tries on everything from bad lingerie to Ann Taylor outfits in her search to pin &quot;it&quot; down. Like Bridget, Ashley tries to please everyone around her: best friend Brea, anxious mother, overworked boss, even singles group members, in her belief that placating others will make her life easier.<br />Unlike Bridget, of course, Ashley openly knows the Lord and has given her life to Him already. Seasoned readers of Christian literature will know from the get-go where Ashley needs to go: straight to Jesus Christ. What sustains Billerbeck's novel is the fact that each Christian needs to take his/her own path to salvation. She is a savvy enough writer to realize that what fundamentally works for John Bunyan and THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS will work for her in the realm of Chick Lit.<br />However, Ashley and Company are not allegorical characters a la Bunyan, and sometimes their characters could use a little more old-fashioned development in order to be seen as full, modern human beings, and not simply caricatures of early millennium born-agains. Brea and John are worse than Smug Marrieds; they're dud marrieds. Ashley and Brea's conversation after the latter's miscarriage made me wonder if Billerbeck had ever spoken to a woman who has experienced pregnancy loss. Telling woman that &quot;It's just a fluke&quot; or anything along the lines of &quot;You'll have more babies&quot; is just not done.<br />Despite this caviling, WHAT A GIRL WANTS for the most part sparkles with reality and humanity. No one tells Ashley to stop working, nor do they tell her to stop believing. In others words, she's a young woman of today --- and readers can look forward to following her adventures in the second Ashley Stockingdale novel, SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL, this August.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-05-17

Not only are they still wildly in love after years of marriage, they have a beautiful and talented daughter attending the University of Virginia and many friends and family members in their home on Virginia's scenic Northern Neck region. Yes, despite Elizabeth's overdramatic and shallow mother, the Whittakers' life is good.<br />Until the moment when Elizabeth's doctor explains that her recent symptoms have an underlying cause: multiple sclerosis. So devastated is the couple that they decide at first to keep the disease a secret; Elizabeth chooses to keep wearing the very high heels she adores, even though her newly unsteady gait makes them dangerous.<br />And for a long time, despite a few mishaps, she is Just Fine, thank you very much --- a common stretch for people with multiple sclerosis, many of whom go for years and even decades showing few symptoms and experiencing little discomfort. But when she winds up back in the hospital and in much worse shape, Elizabeth must not only confront the reality of her disease (crutches, deep fatigue and sensible shoes) but also the reality of others' reactions to it, which drive her away from them and closer to the Neuromuscular Support Group headed by a vivacious woman with more disabilities than Elizabeth who encourages her and other members to own their lives as they are.<br />Unfortunately, some members of that group have an idea that helps them but harms Elizabeth (don't want to be a spoiler!). However, this incident finally gets Elizabeth to face her fear of Other Peoples' Judgments --- especially her own mother's. A subplot involving an angry yet talented young girl is meant to echo Elizabeth's growth as well as move things along. But it doesn't ring as true as does Elizabeth's recognition that only she is qualified to decide how hard things are for her --- and only she can give up her difficulties to God and let Him effect change in her life.<br />Throughout the novel, Elizabeth finds solace in a phenomenon that is shown to her called &quot;sundogs&quot;: rainbow-like arcs in the sky that fishermen in particular pay attention to as heralding changes in the weather. Sundogs, technically a type of ice halo, appear on either side of the sun and do reveal real atmospheric changes --- they're not simply a folktale. Therefore, they're the perfect metaphor for Elizabeth's very real growth as a Christian --- not simply a crutch for her to use alongside the paraphernalia of her illness, but signs that she is warming up to God's all-consuming, relentless love. At first the final family scene (again, no spoiling!) seemed almost too contrived and too perfect --- but in light of the sundogs and their perfect symmetry, on a second read, Baldacci knows what she's doing. May her hope be contagious.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-05-17

Maier's A SKELETON IN GOD'S CLOSET found theologian Dr. Jonathan Weber involved in an archaeological dig; such a dig opens his latest novel, MORE THAN A SKELETON (with its tag line of &quot;It was one man against the world.&quot;) Here, a small but significant find at that dig draws Weber over to Israel and finds him interested in a young man who has begun to captivate the world beyond Jerusalem: Joshua Ben-Yosef, whose personal traits, curriculum vitae and Apostles-like band of followers have already convinced many people that he is The Christ.<br />Maier, a specialist in ancient Rome, is a personally conservative but intellectually liberal academic who has clearly modeled his protagonist on himself: when fundamentalist preacher and television personality Dr. Melvin Merton begins to espouse Ben-Yosef as Christ in his Second Coming, Jon Weber's well-credentialed hackles rise almost instantly. If this really is Jesus, where are His miracles? Where is His death and resurrection? While Shannon Weber seems to fall under Ben-Yosef's spell as her husband doesn't (causing inevitable conflict in their sunny-side-up marriage), Jon waits for Proof.<br />He doesn't have to wait long, since Ben-Yosef starts evincing not just run-of-the-mill miracles, but miracles that nearly replicate those in The Gospels. Water into wine, becalmed seas, and a blind man seeing are all not just run-of-the-mill miracles, but so close to The Gospels that they confirm Ben-Yosef's status for so many people that the world media begins to pay attention --- very, very close attention --- to the man who would be the Messiah. Soon, as his research attempts into Ben-Yosef's past point again and again to the probability of his telling the truth, Weber himself begins to believe.<br />Maier has a brilliant premise for a plot, but his academic execution of pacing, dialogue and setting mean that some readers will drop off before the going gets interesting. Professor Maier has clearly modeled his protagonist on himself, and perhaps his well-credentialed self was well-intentioned --- but Jon Weber speaks stiffly and unnaturally both when he's whispering sweet nothings into Shannon's slightly-too-perfect ear and when he's chatting heartily with his colleagues. On the other hand, sometimes Maier is dead-on accurate and even funny, as when Weber's father tells him that his mother is at a Lutheran ladies' get-together: &quot;I hope the coffee, cookies, and green Jell-O are good!&quot;<br />The plot has its problems, too: it's very hard to believe that in the post-millennium &quot;global village,&quot; Ben-Yosef and his merry men would be able to hide out so effectively and so often --- even if he is the real thing, surely Christ walked more often among the people. And unless Maier meant to tip his hand, the interaction between Ben-Yosef and Shannon seems wrong.<br />Nonetheless, MORE THAN A SKELETON is entertaining, informative and refreshing, about as different from the Left Behind series as you can get while still staying within the realm of Christianity and Christian questions. Perhaps Maier will write more thrillers and gain more authority with the elements of suspense writing so that his smart, thoughtful stories will be supported by tight, fresh writing.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-05-17

But if there's one thing Sigmund Brouwer has proven, he's willing to take on a challenge, and his gifts as a writer are clearly equal to the challenges he faces.    Brouwer offers a view of the events of Holy Week through the eyes of a merchant named Simeon, who has sacrificed the love and respect of his family in his unrelenting efforts to accumulate wealth. As a visitor to Jerusalem, he has heard of this prophet named Jesus and witnessed His arrival in the city, to the praise and adulation of the people who shouted hosannas at the sight of Him. Throughout what will prove to be a tumultuous week, Simeon wrestles with his personal pain and the memories of the losses he has suffered, his numbing depression, and the suicidal thoughts that seem to offer the only hope for escape from his shame and sorrow.    But that was before his encounter with the living Christ. Simeon is, of course, Simeon of Cyrene, the bystander pressed into service by Roman soldiers to carry the cross when Jesus' battered body continually fell under its weight. As you might suspect, his life is transformed in the process. But Brouwer wisely allows that transformation to take place over time, steering clear of a predictable I've-carried-His-cross-and-now-I've-seen-the-light moment.    Brouwer's skill as a storyteller is evident in all his books, and THE WEEPING CHAMBER is no exception. He creates a compelling backstory for Simeon's life and offers up the relevant details of that life a little at a time, keeping the reader in a continual state of curiosity about this man who has lost the will to live. He allows the story to unfold naturally through a seamless, gripping narrative and the daily letters Simeon writes to the wife whose love hehas carelessly discarded.    Even the familiarity of Palestine at the time of Christ gets a fresh makeover in Brouwer's hands, with the scenes that take place in Simeon's seaside home in his native Cyrene providing a welcome contrast to the hustle and bustle of Passover-week Jerusalem. Add to that the ability to write that most elusive of fictional elements --- believable dialogue --- and it's not hard to see why Brouwer has such a loyal fan base.    THE WEEPING CHAMBER breathes new life into the story of Simeon and the journey from Palm Sunday to the empty tomb, just as a brief encounter with Jesus breathes new life into a man whose spirit is slowly dying. For fans of biblical fiction, especially those who have been disappointed by other historical novels set at the time of Christ, Brouwer's latest is a must-read.	2004-05-16

Scott Peck's 1978 book THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED is still known for its opening paragraph, a one-sentence reality check addressed to the upwardly mobile, ready to conquer the world: &quot;Life is difficult.&quot;<br />Donald McCullough similarly starts his new book with a stark, one-line paragraph: &quot;There are limitations in life.&quot; But unlike Peck's bestseller, this is not a book for the hale and hearty young adult who anticipates scaling mountains like &quot;the little engine that could.&quot; Rather, it is for the person who resonates with the problem faced by Mike Mulligan and his aging steam shovel: even the brightest and best of us cannot and will not always be shiny and bright. The book is aptly subtitled &quot;Learning to Appreciate Life's Limitations.&quot;<br />McCullough writes as a fifty-three-year-old recovering achiever --- a successful pastor and preacher turned seminary president whose career exploded several years ago when an unidentified-in-these-pages past failure came to light. From this loss --- of job, reputation, friends and self-definition --- he has written an insightful and helpful book with twenty well-titled chapters, each dealing with the limits of a particular aspect of the good life: achievement, romance, public approval, relationships, spirituality, moral goodness, fitness (the body), the senses, time ...<br />It's a shame that a chapter on the limits of knowledge, &quot;Giving Up on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle,&quot; is placed early in the book, as it is uncharacteristically heavy and could discourage readers from continuing to garner the insight of chapters such as &quot;On Not Being Elected President (or Member of the Condo Board): The Limits of Achievement&quot; and &quot;Mind If I Lean on Your Arm?: The Limits of Confidence,&quot; in which McCullough admits, albeit in third person, &quot;The man who, a few months before, thought nothing of speaking to thousands of people, was suddenly nervous about ... asking forhelp at the bank.&quot;<br />McCullough's anecdotes are engaging and his analysis insightful. He does not wallow in the muck, but leads each topic to a redemptive conclusion.<br />His chapters follow a consistent progression: defining and discussing the value of the identified virtue (the thrill of victory), anecdotally presenting the agony of defeat, laying out consolations --- lessons learned from the loss and benefits of a new, lower-flying life. Many of these consolations can be enjoyed here and now. I note, however, that the chapter about money, &quot;A Sudden Interest in the Future of Social Security,&quot; comes short of discussing the consolations of material poverty but rather turns to a lengthy discussion of Jesus' parable of the fool who built bigger and bigger barns, to his spiritual peril.<br />In contrast, a few chapters include no scriptural reflection. Such is the case with a chapter on the limitations of responsibility, &quot;The World Didn't Even Notice When I Quit Trying to Save It,&quot; which lays out a life-cycle paradox: &quot;To grow in maturity we must accept responsibility.&quot; But eventually &quot;to maintain the trajectory of growth, we have to let go of responsibility as completely as we had to accept it in the first place,&quot; meaning &quot;we must acquiesce to the limitations of what we can do.&quot; We cannot save the world or even, ultimately, our children, as we are not God.<br />It's sobering that a man not yet fifty-five has so well identified and from personal experience discussed losses or restrictions that are mostly age-related, as if the golden decade is more related to autumnal aspen leaves than to bright sun on a clear day.<br />On the other hand, it's refreshing to find a book written with a strong and personal male voice --- it might even be considered a man's book --- that is utterly relevant to professional women and probably all women. For baby boomers of both genders, there's great material here for discussion. McCullough might well have included questions to provoke and focus such group discussion or personal reflection.<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-05-16

So why review this book? Why give him any cyber ink at all?    There are any number of reasons why evangelicals need to be aware of what Borg believes and what he has written, not the least of which is his tremendous influence on non-evangelicals, particularly those who have left mainstream denominations but still long for a way to express what faith they have left. Borg offers them a way of returning to the church that does not require them to adhere to a rigid set of beliefs that they have long considered suspect. And he's very good at what he does and how he does it; his books always sell well, and he is constantly in demand as a speaker. He has a knack for welcoming people \\"home\\" --- to mainline churches --- in a warm and compassionate way.    In THE HEART OF CHRISTIANITY, Borg lays down a welcome mat that has already proven attractive to those who have been disenchanted with what they perceive as an anti-intellectual faith. His welcome mat encourages people to give Christianity another chance because the times have changed, and from those changes a new, inclusive paradigm has emerged. Christianity, he holds, is no longer about a belief in a set of doctrines but about \\"loving God and loving what God loves.\\"    That said, Borg never demeans those who do hold to a strong doctrinal stance and a literal interpretation of the Bible, much of which he considers to be metaphorical. But while many evangelicals dismiss him outright, Borg is obviously trying to build a bridge between the conservative and liberal factions in the church. It's hard for evangelicals to understand how someone who denies the deity of Jesus can be so passionate about Christianity, and yet this book shows Borg to be an evangelist for the faith. He loves Christianity, and he wants Christians to find the common ground that has eluded them for so long.    Even if you completely disagree with Borg's fundamental premise, THE HEART OF CHRISTIANITY is worthwhile reading for anyone who is unafraid to examine a perspective on faith that seemingly differs dramatically from their own. You may be surprised at some of his thoughts, like his suggestion that liberals begin using the term \\"born again\\" to describe their transformation from an old way to a new way of being Christian, or his emphasis on the importance of having an intimate relationship with God.    There's no question that some who read this book will conclude that Borg has cut the heart right out of Christianity. But likewise, there's no question that many lapsed churchgoers will return to the faith as a result of Borg's enormous influence. For that reason alone, evangelicals would do well to familiarize themselves with the work of this highly gifted thinker and communicator.	2004-05-16

One of the youngest players ever to turn pro, Jaeger at 14 was everywhere --- in newspapers and magazines, on television. Her signature long, blonde pigtails made her immediately recognizable. She was the media darling of the tennis world.<br /><br />Her career was cut short by an injury, prompting her to pursue a dream she had had since childhood --- not all that long ago, at the time --- to work with children. After spending several years acquiring business skills and other related experience, Jaeger and a friend moved to Aspen, Colorado, where they eventually set up a foundation and started a ministry to reach out to cancer-stricken children at a place now known as the Silver Lining Ranch. Jaeger's entire $1.4 million in lifetime earnings provided the seed money for the organization.<br /><br />That's the straightforward account of what happened. In FIRST SERVICE, Jaeger fills in the details, the often remarkable, behind-the-scenes story of a woman whose childlike faith in God never questioned that He would bring to pass the hopes and dreams she held out for the future --- a future she always knew would not find its center in professional tennis. In her telling of the story of her life, her faith and her ministry, Jaeger clearly demonstrates that what was once considered to be her youthful exuberance is instead who she really is, because her energy, excitement and enthusiasm for life is every bit as much a part of her personality today, at the age of 38, as it was when she was a celebrity teenager.<br /><br />Throughout her life, as well as the pages of the book, God plays the dominant role. From an early age, Jaeger sensed the presence of God even though she did not grow up in a strong faith environment. Many of her experiences with God have been nothing short of mystical; as a child, she had a vision of the Children's Crusade long before she ever knew anything about the actual event in history. Her narrative is sprinkled with accounts of dreams and visions that are bound to make believers shiver with supernatural delight and skeptics question her grounding in reality. But much of what she saw in those dreams and visions has come to pass and has contributed to the success of the ranch, so the skeptics may have to look elsewhere for something to disbelieve.<br /><br />True to her nature, which apparently is an extraordinarily generous one, Jaeger is donating all of her proceeds from sales of FIRST SERVICE to help hurting children. In addition to the Silver Lining Ranch, Jaeger and the Silver Lining Foundation ([...]) support children's charities in the U.S. and around the world.ade long before she ever knew anything about the actual event in history.

But I think I actually fell in love with it halfway through page 304, where Richard Wightman Fox quotes from a 1910 hymnal I had never heard of before: Manly Songs for Christian Men. How can you not love a book that opens your world to such a wonderful tidbit as that?    In fact, JESUS IN AMERICA is loaded with wonderful tidbits, and that may be a problem for some readers. It's hard to get a sense of unity out of all this. That didn't particularly bother me --- I can do without a full view of the forest as long as the trees are interesting --- but anyone who approaches this book with the expectation of getting a clear, overall perspective on the ever-evolving roles Jesus has played in the life of America, ever since the very first Christian landed on its shores, is likely to be disappointed.    Fox sees Jesus as the quintessential symbol of American society, but hardly a symbol that means the same thing to each person. \\"In all likelihood, Jesus is permanently layered into the American cultural soil. Yet his identity is elastic. There is no single Jesus, in America or anywhere else,\\" he writes. What many American Christians --- and non-Christians --- may be surprised to learn is that so much of what we attribute to our contemporary view of Jesus actually has its roots in Puritan and colonial America. The Puritans, of course, saw the settling of the New World as a significant part of God's plan of redemption for humanity, but it was the renowned colonial preacher Jonathan Edwards who applied the \\"born-again\\" imagery to the mission of Christians in the colonies. America, he believed, utterly exemplified spiritual rebirth.    Readers may also be surprised to discover how often throughout U.S. history Jesus has been adopted as something of a mascot by partisans all along the political spectrum. The \\"Jesus is on our side\\" mentality, as it turns out, isn't just a conservative mentality; liberals have been equally guilty of claiming him to be among their celebrity supporters.    According to Fox, as early as the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville observed that Christianity was what kept the self-absorbed individuals of America together as a nation. As Fox writes, \\"Jesus is a transferable loyalty: people move around the social arena and take him along. People use him for psychological cushioning when they feel anxious or alone. They offer him as proof of respectability when they need a job, a spouse, or a reputation. And they sometimes take him as a personal moral challenge to give more to others and take less for themselves.\\"    And here's a parting tidbit: The first feature-length film depicting the life of Christ, the violent and disturbing From the Manger to the Cross, was released in 1912, much to the dismay of one movie reviewer who considered the crucifixion scene \\"almost too ghastly in its strict realism.\\" Lo and behold, Mel Gibson seems to have had an equally scorned predecessor.    Bottom line here is that with regard to wordsmithing and research, Fox does an excellent job; with regard to structure, not so much. But JESUS IN AMERICA is still worth reading. If nothing else, you may learn a new song to teach to your manly choir.	2004-05-16

As much as we'd like to believe that early Christians worshiped in unity and held to a unified doctrinal viewpoint, historical evidence indicates otherwise. The faith of the followers of Christ in the first three centuries took such diverse paths that even those denominations that seem to be polar opposites today have far more in common than some of the Christian sects that flourished in the early years of the church.    Due in part to the rapid and widespread growth of Christianity but without a corresponding improvement in communication, local churches were at the mercy of a host of influences and a diversity of beliefs about God, Jesus, and the interpretation of apostolic teaching. Numerous writings, most of which were later omitted from the New Testament canon, were considered authentic and true representations of the teachings of Christ.    That diversity of belief gave rise to sects like the anti-Jewish Marcionites, who dismissed the Old Testament as irrelevant, loved the writings of Paul, and believed Jesus did not have a flesh-and-blood body; the Ebionites, who considered Paul a heretic and believed Jesus was born of the (...) union of Joseph and Mary, later to be \\"adopted\\" by God as His son to fulfill His mission; and the Phibionites, who allegedly engaged in orgiastic and cannibalistic activities, though the accounts of those activities are highly suspect. Those are just three examples of the numerous sects that flourished at the time, all of which Ehrman examines in fascinating detail.    Ehrman, of course, also gives plenty of ink to the non-canonical writings, many of them a part of the now well-known collection of Gnostic literature. Because the canon had not been established, these writings were widely read and circulated and considered by many Christians to be just as authoritative as the books we now have in the New Testament. That created a fair amount of conflict when the bishops of the church began meeting in the fourth century to try to sort out all the divergent views and to separate the \\"correct\\" writings from the obvious and not-so-obvious forgeries as well as the writings that were authentic but expressed views that the bishops considered unorthodox.    There are plenty of other books on the market now that offer a glimpse into the somewhat complicated world of early Christianity. But what sets LOST CHRISTIANITIES apart is Ehrman's ability to convey such an abundance of historical information in such an enjoyable way. As an academic --- Ehrman is the chair of the religious studies department at the Chapel Hill campus of the University of North Carolina --- he provides a thorough overview of what it meant to be Christian in the three centuries immediately following the resurrection without ever lapsing into a dry, scholarly (also known as \\"boring\\") mode. Throughout, he speculates on a series of \\"What if?\\" questions (\\"What if the Marcionites had had their way?\\" and the like), eventually drawing the conclusion that had one of the more peculiar expressions of Christian faith become the dominant one, Christianity itself would be little more than a footnote in today's history books. Some believers may have their most cherished notions about the early church rocked to the core, but in reality there's nothing here that should threaten anyone's faith.    If you're looking for a single book that pulls together an enormous amount of information on the early years of Christianity and presents it in a highly readable and entertaining way, you'd be hard-pressed to find a book that surpasses LOST CHRISTIANITIES.	2004-05-16

If this clouds my objectivity as a reviewer, I'll admit it; I'd rather be a bad book review writer than a bad parent.<br />MOM, I HATE MY LIFE! by Sharon Hersh gives mothers of adolescent daughters the tools with which to shape their own particular parent-child relationship. While Hersh does not stray from the spiritual path, neither does she hammer it home to her readers. She realizes that most will already be Christians who recognize that we must render unto our children their worldly due and that sometimes that worldliness will conflict with our own deeply held convictions.<br />Never you mind, says Hersh, because first of all, God is in control whether we remember to acknowledge that or not. Second, a mother's heart is strong enough to contain mistakes and heartaches along with triumphs and progress, even if we never saw those coming: &quot;Of course, we couldn't imagine when our daughters were cute baby girls that one day they would stonily stare us in the face and announce, 'I hate my life,'&quot; Hersh writes in her introduction, titled &quot;A Haven in the Storm.&quot;<br />She continues, &quot;As mothers, we can become our daughters' greatest allies in the midst of the inevitable and sometimes scary emotional turmoil of growing up female. What I call hand-in-hand mothering begins with the conviction that as we stretch to meet our daughters' needs --- learning in the midst of not knowing, and giving even when we don't feel like we have anything to give --- we can experience personal transformation and guide our daughters toward emotional maturity.&quot; To that end, Hersh has divided her book into three sections: Understanding Your Worlds, Building a Bridge Between Your Worlds, and Conquering Roadblocks to Relationships. Each section has four chapters, and each chapter has several&quot;Just For You&quot; boxes that contain relationship strengthening exercises, suggestions for activities/reflections, and checklists.<br />Hersh doesn't simply tell, tell, tell --- she provides anecdotes from both her professional practice and her personal parenting so that readers can see real life and how her advice works in it. Her practical advice is highly valuable, too. For example, she counsels helping your daughter to make a &quot;sacred space&quot; in her room that she's really comfortable in. She recommends not prying, but if you do need to do a search of a girls' room for illegal substances, have her watch you as you do it rather than doing it on the sly.<br />Hersh and her daughter Kristin collaborated on a beautiful 1 Corinthians 13 For Mothers of Teenage Girls that closes her book, and she also provides an excellent list of resources for each area she discusses in the book. Whether your daughter is 10 or 20, I recommend buying MOM, I HATE MY LIFE! and keeping it close at hand as you take her hand and continue your journey, together.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-05-16

In his latest book, Strobel presents evidence pertaining to the theory of intelligent design, the hypothesis that a designer was behind the creation of the universe.    In building his case, Strobel looks at the evidence in six fields of scientific study: cosmology (basically, the study of the universe), physics, astronomy, biochemistry, biology and human consciousness. In each field, he interviews well known and highly respected scientists --- not all Christians, but all who have come to the conclusion that the evidence for a Creator is significant, if not overwhelming. As might be expected, Darwin pretty much gets raked over the coals, for good reason, and even the brilliant Stephen Hawking is proven to be on somewhat shaky ground when it comes to his theory of the beginning of the universe.    What sets Strobel's book apart from so many others on intelligent design is its sheer readability. I suspect that more than a few people avoid reading books on the origins of the universe simply because the prose is so abominably dry. By using his trademark interview format, the author --- a journalist at heart --- injects life and liveliness into what becomes a series of extended conversations on scientific theories. An added benefit is that we get to \\"hear\\" exactly what the scientists have said, not Strobel's interpretation of what they said. What's more, Strobel stands in our place, probing and prodding and questioning until he's satisfied that the scientific theories and academic jargon have been translated into intelligible English. And more than once, he plays devil's advocate, bringing up a multitude of objections that Darwinians and all those other non-creationists would be likely to point out.    There are moments in the book when the filler --- the background on each of the interviewees, say, or the scene-setting paragraphs --- starts to feel a bit contrived. But that's a minor glitch in the otherwise seamless narrative, sort of like hitting a rumble strip on a highway every now and then. You know it's there, but soon enough you're back on smooth asphalt again. Given the enormous amount of information and insight Strobel offers, it's a minor glitch indeed.    Simply put, THE CASE FOR A CREATOR has done for the existence of God what Strobel's other titles did for Christ and faith itself: amassed such a preponderance of evidence on the pro side that the con side starts to look downright foolish. You're not likely to find another book so packed with scientific data that is as compelling and enjoyable to read as this one is. It's a terrific starting point for anyone who has been hesitant to tackle denser tomes on origins and creation, but it's also a great resource for those who already have a fair amount of knowledge on those subjects.	2004-05-16

At the beginning of the book Esmeralda lives in Live Oaks, South Carolina, where the town's latest crime wave is \\"boys busting watermelons in a field.\\"<br />In paragraph 1 of GOOD HEAVENS, a board member of Priscilla Home, a Christian halfway house for adult female addicts, asks Esmeralda to come on board as the resident manager, a \\"fancy name for housemother.\\" By the end of chapter 1, Esmeralda is on the move --- driving her old Chevy toward her new responsibilities and home, on an isolated North Carolina hilltop. Why would anyone do this? Because God --- through Esmeralda's King James Bible bolstered by a \\"C. H. Splurgeon\\" motto and the fortuitous rental of her house --- has told her to trust and obey.<br />When she arrives at Priscilla Home, Esmeralda discovers it needs more than a housemother --- its bills are overdue, its larder is bare, and its young director, Ursula, is floundering, making little headway with donors or with the dozen residents in her care.<br />Plucky Esmeralda, armed with old-fashioned common sense, her marked-up King James Bible and a mind full of \\"Splurgeon\\" one-liners, comes to the rescue. As for that Bible, at one crisis point when Esmeralda, frustrated with Ursula, wonders if she herself has become the Ugly Christian, she turns to the Gospel of Matthew. \\"Good heavens,\\" she says to herself, \\"there was so much in there that was hard to take. I had to get out of the Sermon on the Mount. Checking out the cross references, I turned to Ephesians. Well, lo and behold, the same kind of stuffwas in Ephesians. At least the words weren't printed in red.\\"<br />Margaret Graham lays out an engaging plot --- always one more hurdle to overcome --- reining in a host of characters. With little thanks to Ursula and her Group therapy sessions but, rather, through Esmeralda's one-on-one conversations and the larger context of her newly instituted Prayer and Praise sessions, we gradually get to know the driving \\"issues\\" in the lives of maybe six of the home residents; we meet local residents who are surprisingly supportive of a residential ministry in their neighborhood. And yes, toward the end, there's a romantic subplot.<br />This is Graham's second Esmeralda novel, but this book clearly stands on its own. Having not read the first book, MERCY ME, I did not feel at a disadvantage, though the cast of characters gets nearly out of hand when the home town women's group from the Apostolic Bible Church --- seemingly the focal characters of MERCY ME --- comes for a visit.<br />In this novel, I see shades of Jan Karon's Mitford series. But the voice and view is first person, not third; you see the world through Esmeralda's eyes only. And that worldview is not from a southern small-town main street (the origin of the phrase \\"mainline\\" churches), but from the back roads and fundamentalist rows. The Mitford series for the Bible Church set? Maybe that's what the Esmeralda series can be.<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-05-16

In the process of telling their tale, he espouses a return to the enduring values of family, faithfulness and fidelity in the marriage relationship.<br />Decrying the prevailing popularity of \\"sex without strings and marriage without rings,\\" Zacharias shares invaluable insights for nurturing a marriage that stands the test of time. For example, in the chapter titled \\"The Living Act of a Dead Self,\\" he writes that \\"if the first thing about committing the will is that it is a death to yourself, what comes to life is a disposition that seeks to serve.\\"<br />Zacharias lists personal maturity, premarital counseling and preparation for disagreements as the three characteristics of a couple properly prepared for life as man and wife. And with clarity and conviction, he drives home the point that \\"conflict resolution is the key to success in most marriages,\\" an understatement if ever there was one.<br />As Zacharias points out, the wedding is the easiest part of being married, and it is not until afterward that couples actually discover whether or not their words carry the weight of authenticity. To help couples striving to make their marriage a success, he proposes some governing disciplines that must translate into the lives of each partner.<br />According to Zacharias, there must be a daily commitment to prayer, to the study of the scriptures and to active involvement in a local church, if couples are to cultivate the type of character that enables them to successfully navigate the stormy seas of modern day matrimony.<br />Presenting foundational truths in the face of mounting threats to marriage, the book is a useful guide for establishing love that lasts for a lifetime. It is specially suited for use as a premarital counseling tool and related church resource; it's also recommended reading for any couple seeking to ground their relationship in biblical bedrock.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-03-28

He believes we have bought into a pattern of self-centeredness --- our lives revolve around what we convince ourselves will make us happy. We want to express ourselves.

We are big self-promoters. \\"No wonder our homes are so noisy, businesses so stress-filled, government so cutthroat, and harmony so rare,\\" he writes.<br />Couldn't we use a change?<br />Change, even good change, is difficult for most of us. To take ourselves out of the spotlight is no easy task, Lucado believes. \\"We've been demanding our way and stamping our feet since infancy.\\" However, to serve \\"self\\" creates chaos, he says, using the example of an orchestra in which each artist clamors for self-expression. \\"Who enjoys contributing to a cacophony? You don't. We don't. We were not made to live this way,\\" Lucado writes.<br />Arguing that \\"what Copernicus did for the earth, God does for our souls,\\" Lucado writes of how God points to the Son --- his Son --- and says, \\"Behold the center of it all.\\" Then he asks the reader, \\"could a Copernican shift be in order?\\" We should use the moon for our model, \\"let her do what she was made to do, and a clod of dirt becomes a source of inspiration...the moon reflects the greater light.\\"<br />Life is full of change, and with it comes fear, insecurity, sorrow and stress. \\"Cemeteries interrupt the finest families. Retirement finds the best employees. Age withers the strongest bodies.\\" How do we focus on God in the midst of it? God's ways will never alter, Lucado reminds us. He alone is unchangeable and unshakeable, and we can focus on Him with confidence.<br />Lucado alerts us to a deadly question we torment ourselves with: \\"What are people thinking of you?\\" Vulnerably, he shares his own battle with pride. \\"We applause-aholics have done it all: dropped names, sung loudly, dressed up to look classy, dressed down to look cool, quoted authors we've never read, spouted Greek we've never studied.\\" He reminds us --- and himself --- that we are only messengers of the message. It's not about us.<br />He also warns against legalism, which he says is \\"joyless, because legalism is endless....There is always another class to attend, person to teach, mouth to feed.\\" When we believe we can earn our way to heaven, we discount God, and in the process, end up in a mess ourselves. Then he reminds us of grace, something Lucado has done in almost every book he's written. \\"Grace offers rest. Legalism never does....Can you earn this salvation? No. Don't dishonor God by trying.\\"<br />He touches on our need for keeping spiritually and physically fit, as well as reminding us of the place of sex as \\"a celebration of permanence, a tender moment in which the body continues what the mind and the soul have already begun.\\" Even though it's not about us, we are charged with keeping our body in good order so God can use it.<br />Lucado devotes a chapter to exploring the self-centered belief that \\"my struggles are about Him\\" and realigning ourselves with the knowledge that pain and problems have a purpose --- the glory of God. His words clearly state his belief that God is in control but sometimes allows illness or death as a way to showcase his glory, which will resonate with some readers and be a point of disagreement for others.<br />Grounded in scripture, salted with wry humor, liberally seasoned with grace and sprinkled with interesting anecdotes and illustrations, this compact book has the feel of a comfortable chat with a wise older brother or favorite uncle.

He's supposed to be the &quot;valiant vigilante,&quot; I guess --- but it's really Ruby who decides to exercise vigilante justice while looking in to Aldridge's relationship with his ex-wife, children, lover, and an odd student whom she herself now instructs, and who won't leave her alone.<br />The more Ruby interferes with the murder investigation, the more she and Wesley interfere with each other --- and since both of them have renewed their commitment to living by God's rules, they are wary of heating up a relationship they don't want to consummate. To complicate matters further, six-foot Ruby wears her newfound faith as awkwardly as she does her clothes (one memorable ensemble includes moon boots, a lilac down coat, and mismatched mittens). She's constantly making faux pas with her colleague Donita, an eccentric but very intelligent PhD who makes Ruby feel insecure both professionally and personally as Donita rebuffs Ruby's attempts to introduce her to Christ over a bowl of M&amp;Ms.<br />Unfortunately, Ruby's ultimate lesson is more sickeningly sweet than a vat full of chocolate: the office cleaning lady, Celeste, has Down's Syndrome, and after a session of singing &quot;Jesus Loves Me,&quot; Ruby realizes that Celeste's simple faith is more potent than her own. I didn't buy this any more than I bought Ruby and Wesley's ridiculously mangled dates --- but I did buy the idea that Ruby knows she doesn't belong in academia, and I did buy Ruby and Wesley's knowledge that their courtship is more about hearts and souls than hands and lips.<br />I also bought Dunn's ability to pace a murder mystery; the plot elements relating to Aldridge's murder, murderer, and motive were very well done (and it seems I'm now catching on to the author's taste for alliteration, too). One of the funniest things in the book is how Wesley, cop of the beat, nearly always fails to show up in time to save Ruby. (Her mother has an excellent scene where she does so, however.) This book goes down as quickly as chocolate, as smoothly as a mocha, and leaves more than a lingering taste for Jesus --- just the thing for a comforting, fun read.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-03-28

Still grieving after six months, David is surprised to receive a letter from Angela, a longtime friend of Jessica's whom David met when the three were involved in a youth group some 15 years earlier. Even more surprising is Angela's reason for writing: Several days before her death, Jessica wrote to Angela and sent her something to give David after she died, at a time and place of Angela's choosing. Recently divorced, Angela lives in Headly Manor, \\"one of the most haunted houses in England,\\" which she and her ex-husband used as a source of income by charging visitors to experience the legendary residence of assorted ghosts. She plans a weekend reunion for those in the youth group that she and Angela knew best and tells David she will give him Jessica's gift at that time.    If all this sounds like a setup for a predictable romance between David and Angela, you'll be delighted to know that British author Adrian Plass's writing is anything but predictable. He consistently turns away from the obvious plot path, opting instead for less-traveled roads that not only keep the story moving along but also offer far more interesting opportunities for the characters to show themselves for who they are. Each of the former friends who meet at the house for the weekend is a fully developed, fully believable character haunted by his or her personal ghosts. Headly Manor's ghosts may be imaginary, but the ghosts that accompany the reunion guests are all too real.    From the start, you sense that GHOSTS is going to turn out to be a \\"Christian\\" book --- God speed the day when we can discard that designation! --- like no other you've read. After an opening in which David has a nightmare within a nightmare, Plass begins to tip his hand and reveal himself as the extraordinary writer he is. His poignant portrayal of David's approach to processing his grief --- his unwillingness to move the books on Jessica's nightstand or disturb the other \\"tiny museums of personal randomness\\" for months after her death --- culminates in David's suggestion that God reward his faithful service in ministry by allowing Jessica to appear to him one last time. It's a request that under other circumstances David would likely call unbiblical, but grief does that to a person. It changes one's theology, if only temporarily.    The events of the weekend comprise the largest share of the story, a story that Plass tells both skillfully and beautifully. The skill is evidenced by his ability to express spiritual and psychological truth with subtlety and finesse; the beauty is evidenced in Plass's apparent love of language, which he uses with grace and elegance. Throughout, the dialogue and action are wholly believable; the reunion guests are real people whose faith has at times taken quite the beating --- and whose spiritual struggles are nowhere near over. As the weekend unfolds, so do the hidden lives of the former friends. The reunion ends up bringing together much more than seven very different people.    GHOSTS is Plass's U.S. fiction debut --- and a remarkable literary achievement. Ironically, before writing GHOSTS, Plass was best-known in England for religious satire and nonfiction books, including a commentary on the book of Mark enigmatically titled NEVER MIND THE REVERSING DUCKS. With this novel, he raises the Christian fiction bar higher. Highly recommended for readers who crave a beautifully told, compelling, and transforming story.	2004-03-28

Half way into the first chapter, I knew I would, especially when I realized I was smiling as I read.<br />Maybe I was smiling because Lee Knapp is so much like me --- we're both recovering fundamentalists, mothers of boys, as well as sharing similar chaotic childhoods --- and yet, she's so much better at articulating what I'm thinking and feeling than I am. Or perhaps, she's just more honest about her struggles to fulfill everyone else's expectations for her ---her parents', her children's, her faith community's and even her perception of what she thought God wanted her to be. Whatever the reason, her book is very good, particularly because she's such a good writer.<br />The lines in the introduction that grabbed me were these: &quot;About a fourth of the way into writing the first draft of this book, I found my voice. This was a much better proportion than the 50 percent of my life I have spent trying to figure out who I am.&quot; A sentence or two later, she writes, &quot;The other half of the time I've tripped into the traps of comparing myself either to someone else or to some impossible standard.&quot;<br />And so starts chapter after chapter of well-written prose examining bits and pieces of her life as mom, wife, daughter, artist, writer, friend and church member, learning to tune out everyone else's voice and discover, for the first time in her life, a true sense of freedom. As a writer, this freedom allows her to stop trying to sound on paper like somebody else; as a Christian, she learned to cease conforming to her faith community's impossible standard of perfection and &quot;lack of emotionalism.&quot; As a mom, it meant stopping to try to make her three boys perfect and as a daughter, it was a fresh permission to look back on her father's life from the perspective of adulthood, with a much better appreciation of how muchhe loved her, even if he had trouble expressing it.<br />In her first essay, Knapp explains she was voted &quot;Most Likely To Succeed&quot; by her high school classmates, a title she found flattering at the time, but in looking back, &quot;was actually rather cruel.&quot; The phrase &quot;carries a burden of proof that is missed at eighteen, but painfully obvious at forty.&quot; In less than a hundred paragraphs she unravels what it means to be a success comparing her son, who is complaining he'll never grow to be able to compete with much larger and more talented boys, to her own life.<br />&quot;I have wanted the desires of my heart and the toil of my hands to produce instant results, like the time-lapsed National Geographic films of lilies blooming or baby chicks hatching. Anything I could imagine producing --- whether it was art or money or children --- would seamlessly and gracefully unfold while a soft-spoken narrator gently explained every well-ordered and beautiful phrase. But in my experience, life doesn't work that way...When my Big Zero year was approaching, I was defending myself against the feeling that zero was also the sum total of my life. I couldn't get the thought out of my mind that by forty I should be slam-dunking life in a tank top with armpits full of hair too. Like Eric's, my desire for stature and my need to achieve something really big by then had grown so overblown that it blurred a long-ago strongly held sense of identity. I should have heeded my own advice to Eric, only slightly adjusted for middle age: You do need a deep sense of who you are on the inside when surrounded, seemingly, by people whose glands drained way before yours.&quot;<br />As a writer myself, I often hope for one or two great sentences --- and I mean, really great sentences like Knapp's --- per essay. Knapp's work is filled with so many great lines that thumbing through my copy shows more underlined prose than not. This quick read has plenty of &quot;ah ha&quot; lines that will leave you not only smiling, but also wanting to leave your copy on the nightstand to come back to, again and again.<br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2004-03-28

Baumbich introduced readers to the small town of Partonville, &quot;a circle-the-square&quot; town in the northern part of southern Illinois. In this delightful sequel, Baumbich continues her saga of small-town life and the mélange of whacky, loveable characters who inhabit Partonville. After 87 years, Dorothy Jean Westra makes her peace with leaving Crooked Creek Farm, her birthplace and lifelong home. She's sure she hears God whispering &quot;Remember well all you see, for these splendid images will sustain you in the days to come.&quot; Taking Him at His word, she stores up memories to help her make the transition to Tess Walker's old place, right smack next door to her best friend May Belle and her mentally-challenged adult son Earl.<br />Most of the characters from the first book are here. The United Methodist Church's Social Concerns committee is putting together the Fall Rummage Sale, and as usual, Acting Mayor Gladys McKern is throwing her weight around, letting the ladies know who really runs things. Jessica Joy is juggling motherhood and work, nursing little Sarah Sue and feeling like &quot;a wrung-out dairy cow.&quot; As she tries to keep the small Lamp Post Motel running while her husband, Paul, works long hours in the coal mines of southern Illinois, she also eeks out time to hone her artistic talent.<br />Jessica discovers an unexpected friend in city slicker Katie Durbin, who with her teenage son, Josh, has returned for a visit to Partonville. Although the town folks suspect Katie has bought Crooked Creek Farm as a real estate investment for possible development, Katie finds on her return to Partonville that &quot;a quiet ache brewed within. For what, she wasn't exactly sure, but the words &quot;blessed friends and family swirled around her. Tugged, prodded, beckoned.&quot; Katie finds herself yearning to become a part of the little community she once scorned as &quot;Pardon-Me-Ville.&quot; After living life at dizzifying speed, Katie realizes it might be time to slow down.<br />Dorothy, on the other hand, is still moving at a brisk pace, earning her online screen name, &quot;Outtamyway.&quot; Change is in the air, however, and some of it is bittersweet. Dorothy's &quot;rusty-and-white&quot; Lincoln, a.k.a. &quot;The Tank,&quot; is showing signs of decline, and at 87-years-young, Dorothy is dealing with heart problems that threaten to detour her cheerful, optimistic approach to everything. But no matter what challenges she faces, the indomitable Dorothy's philosophy is &quot;We better be living the life we want to live and not wasting our numbered days on what doesn't matter.&quot; Whether it's cheering on aging Pitcher Jessie Landers during the community softball team (pom poms in hand!) or playing bunco with the &quot;Happy Hookers,&quot; it's a sure bet that wherever the action is, Dorothy will be there also.<br />How many risks will Dorothy take before she's taken one too many? When the disintegrating &quot;Tank&quot; is set to run in the demolition derby to go out in a blaze of glory, everyone wonders who the mystery driver is behind the wheel.

The club includes Dorothy's best friend, May Belle, who makes award-winning double chocolate brownies and keeps a solicitous watch over her mentally challenged adult son Earl, who Partonville residents describe as &quot;slow and particular.&quot;<br />Maggie Malone, the 72-year-old proprietor of La Feminique Hair Salon &amp; Day Spa, never fails to shock the ladies with her propensity for change, and she's about to make a new fashion statement that will surprise the whole town. Soft-spoken sixty-two-year-old Nellie Ruth McGregor is the youngster in the club, who owes a debt to Dorothy she can never repay. Rounding out the club is Glady's McKern, the swaggering &quot;acting mayor&quot; of Partonville, and Jessie Landers, an aged former semi-professional softball star who still throws a mean pitch for the Wild Musketeers, the community team.<br />Down at Harry's Grill, rumors fly thick and fast about farmers selling out to a big developer. Sharon Teller, a reporter for the Partonville Press, works hard to get a big scoop on what is up the handsome developer Colton Craig's sleeve. Few of the town's residents guess that the resident of Partonville who is struggling with whether to sell or keep her farm is --- Dorothy! As always, when faced with difficulty, Dorothy spends time praying about what she should do with the family acreage where she was born. In her ritual evening &quot;Moment with the Big Guy&quot;, she straightforwardly addresses the Lord succinctly: &quot;Dear Lord, give me answers. Now. Amen.&quot; Or her favorite prayer, &quot;Dear Jesus, Just DO something. Amen.&quot; She's also been known to blow God kisses.<br />God answers Dorothy's prayer in the unlikely guise of 47-year-old divorcee' Katie Durbin and her 15-year-old son Josh, who come down from Chicago to settle the estate of Katie's Aunt Tess Walker, one of Partonville's reclusive eccentrics. Katie has nothing but scorn for the country ways of &quot;Pardon-Me-Ville,&quot; and hopes to get her business there wrapped up quickly and head back to her high-powered life in the city. Yet, Partonville has a way of ambushing the hearts of those who visit it, and under the warm care of the town's inhabitants, Katie finds old prejudices beginning to melt.<br />Although Baumbich's refreshingly unpretentious writing is not quite as seamless as Karon's, her ability to craft characters as interesting as Karon's does will cause them to sneak into your heart and take up residence there. Fans of the &quot;Mitford&quot; series should take to this new one from the same parent company like ducks to water.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-03-28

That was Hinton's first novel, and it was a delicious whip of church women, their life events and their recipes. Small wonder that this new one isn't to the taste of Cake fans; THE THINGS I KNOW BEST is altogether darker, tangier, and heavier.<br />That isn't to say it's a dark book; rather, it's a quiet book, and perhaps closer to its author's heart. When she wrote it, Hinton was a United Church of Christ pastor. In an interview on her website, she says that she believes the issue of race relations is the most important one we can resolve today. That issue is central to this book, which tells two interracial stories: one about eighteen-year-old Tessa Ivy of Pleasant Cross, North Carolina, who has a relationship with a boy of mixed race, and one about her mother and her mother's relationship with her best friend, an African-American woman, which is soured for reasons no one will discuss.<br />Tessa comes from three generations of &quot;Ivy women&quot; who believe they &quot;see things&quot; --- Tessa herself reads tea leaves and interprets dreams. Of course, no one's &quot;knowing,&quot; as the Ivy family calls it, has led any of the women to great fortune, although Mama Bertie does use her gift to help the local funeral director keep his schedule straight. They live in a trailer park, and Tessa works at the local supercenter. Much of the background of Tessa's family is revealed during the women's dinner preparation (one is best at cooking meat, another vegetables and a third takes pride in side dishes).<br />Tessa says, &quot;I suppose it would seem to any ordinary person that Knowing would make the women in our family rich or smart or at the very least well respected; but the truth is the Knowing hasn't given us anything extra. It seems, in fact, to have created a curse. All the Ivy women lean towards making bad decisions, especially when it comes to money and men. And just as we have accepted the ways we all Know, we also have accepted each other's poor choices in husbands and fathers for our children.&quot;<br />THINGS I KNOW BEST concerns Tessa's newly adult attempts to figure out how to make different choices for herself. When the enigmatic and devout Reverend Renfrew comes to town in his Airstream trailer, towing his son Sterling, Tessa finds out that there are things she couldn't possibly &quot;know.&quot; Some of those are deeply sad and frightening, others are wonderfully joyful --- but above all, they're true and worth knowing, as opposed to &quot;knowing.&quot; Or, as Tessa's grandmother says, &quot;A body could know everything there is to know about the future, but that don't guarantee happiness.&quot; Neither will reading this book --- but it's worth a peek.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-03-28

But at the age of ten, when she was away at camp and her family moved without telling her, Ford found herself standing in a room full of strangers who were all looking at her funny. And lo and behold, she wasn't with her family. Unfortunately for Ford, the funny looks continued long after she was &quot;born again&quot; and desperately tries to fit in with other Christians.<br />In MEMOIR OF A MISFIT, Ford writes what it's like to be a square peg trying to fit into a round hole --- something most of us can relate to, especially within church walls. But what sets Ford apart from the rest of us &quot;misfits&quot; in Christendom is her willingness to stop embracing the impossible ideal of what a Christian is supposed to look, act and feel like and just be...herself. On the way there, though, she runs around in circles, trying everything --- promiscuity, marriage, drugs, alcohol, suicidal thoughts, fundamentalist Christianity, finally chucking all religion --- before eventually coming around, thanks to a couple of Christians showing her unconditional love, to a new faith and realistic understanding of God.<br />At certain points in her narrative, I felt Ford was sharing too much personal information and it made me a tad uncomfortable. But it works because she writes her tragic tale with so much honesty and tongue-in-cheek wit that it keeps you from getting bogged down in just how sad her story really is. Maybe it's because there's so much to read between the lines.<br />I thought about Ford's words and my status as a &quot;misfit&quot; as I sat in church last weekend, surrounded by people who all seem to have their act together. Everyone was smiling. Everyone looked so perfect. During the sermon, I actually turned every which way, scanning the crowd to see if I could find someone, anyone not fitting that mold Ford desperately had to break free from before she was able to have an honest and growing relationship with God. I was a hair's breath away from asking the person sitting behind me if she ever questioned anything or if she had any problems. I admit, Ford's book made me wonder how much of myself I had checked at the sanctuary door without noticing before that moment.<br />Ford's bottom line? Breaking free. And that bottom line serves several purposes: First, to admonish fellow Christians to allow others to discover God loves them, quirks and all. To deny that basic tenet of the Christian faith narrows the Gospel message to one of &quot;fitting in.&quot; Her life story echoes Jesus' words in Matthew 9 as he scolds the Pharisees, &quot;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick...I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&quot;<br />Ford's should serve as encouragement to other misfits in the church --- and all of us fit into that category, really --- to stop contorting ourselves into acceptance. Right now. Her journey of faith hasn't exactly been a straight line, but thankfully, she's forged a path for all of us who love God but have been turned off by the church. She wants us to come back and try again. This time, not looking around, comparing ourselves to others but rather looking up and getting to know God --- the God of misfits.<br />   --- Reviewed by Diana Keough	2004-03-28

When she refused (some theologians believe he meant to parade her naked before his guests), he banished her from the throne and decided to choose a new queen. While conducting a sort of beauty pageant of candidates, Ahasuerus was captivated by Esther, young woman whose Jewish identity was carefully concealed. He crowned his chosen new queen with diamonds.<br />But while Esther had hidden her identity, she had not forgotten it. When the uncle who raised her, Mordecai, learned of a plot to kill the king, she was able to save her husband's life and to bring her uncle to his attention. Later still, when the king's villainous minister Haman ordered destruction of all the Jews in the kingdom on the 13th day of the month of Adar by lots, or &quot;purim,&quot; Mordecai urged his niece to plead with the king to save her people. Going before the king without a summons could mean death, so Esther's courage in doing so was great. She persuaded the king, using all her feminine wiles, to grant her any wish, and he did --- the Jews of Persia were saved and destroyed their enemies. The 14th and 15th days of Adar were then set aside as a feast, to be known forever after as &quot;Purim.&quot;<br />Because of Esther's acceptance of her fate (hiding her faith and going willingly to the King's bed without benefit of marriage), her story has been denounced over the centuries by different Jewish and Christian commentators and clergy. Add to these criticisms the fact that the ten-chapter Book of Esther does not once mention God's name, and you have a tale that is not easy to tell as a Christian novel of redemption!<br />Tenney gets around some of the story's difficulties (perhaps why he enlisted fiction writer Mark Andrew Olsen as a &quot;contributor?&quot;) by 1) limiting the &quot;action&quot; during Esther's first night with Xerxes to hours of deep conversation and 2) using the Orthodox Jewish trope of referring to God as &quot;G-d&quot; or &quot;YHWH&quot; so that readers will begin to believe that the absence of His name in The Book of Esther was pious and not premeditated.<br />Still, it's shocking at first to read Esther's calm, calculating reasons for allowing herself to be prepped for King Xerxes, and even more shocking to read of her growing desire for what would have been a lawless coupling: &quot;I found that soon I began to desire the King in a wide variety of ways: to crave his presence, his words, his trust --- as well as that moment of our physical union.&quot; However, Tenney tries very hard to connect Esther's desire for the King with her growing desire for The King, or &quot;G-d.&quot; He also, by framing her story with that of one of her descendants, a young contemporary Jewish bride-to-be, tries to connect Esther's elaborate knowledge and use of female adornments and beauty and sensitivity with the Judeo-Christian ideal of marriage.<br />Tenney's success in making these connections has its problems, in literary terms: the framing device is simply not strong enough or long enough for his purposes. His success in making these connections may have other problems, as well. But he does succeed in bringing Esther and her world vividly to life (at times HADASSAH: One Night with the King is reminiscent of Anita Diamant's THE RED TENT), and this can be connected to an important lesson that many theologians have made about The Book of Esther.<br />For Esther and other characters in the novel (including Mordecai and a young Jewish boy made into a eunuch), God's presence can seem farthest away when it is really closest. Jews celebrate the fact that Esther followed her path and used what she had to save her people. We may never know whether or not Esther followed that path because she believed God was guiding her, or not. Nevertheless, her story can instruct modern believers in having courage and struggling on despite the course of events. By re-imagining this rich, historic tale, Tenney has given readers a gift similar to that Esther gave Xerxes: a source of wonder and conversation.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-03-28

A cozy den of warm, burnished oak, filled with all the books I never had time to read on earth. Outside it's snowing, but I'm all toasty sitting next to the fire in my Masterpiece Theatre setting, minus the pipe. Oh, go ahead and add the pipe to the picture. Can't do any harm, because this is heaven. Besides, I'm expecting C.S. in a bit, and Mr. Lewis does like a good pipe now and then.    After our visit, perhaps I'll retire to my high-tech language lab, where I'll focus on my current course of study, Icelandic, having reached the I's in my alphabetized foreign language curriculum. No snow tomorrow --- whatever \\"tomorrow\\" means here, but we do get to know the weather in advance --- so I'll take the path over the mountain and through the woods to the village, where I'll join several of my dearest friends at an outdoor caf and sip a steaming cup of Folgers as we discuss the deeper issues of life. I mean, the afterlife.    Not your idea of heaven? No problem. Anthony DeStefano assures me, and you, too, that we'll have something of a customized eternity. Meaning, I get Masterpiece Theatre and you get Tahiti or wherever your mind goes when the word heaven pops into it. And for that, DeStefano has taken his share of heat. But then, some people just don't know how to have fun.    The point here is that people generally have a view of heaven that's somewhat lacking. Some imagine an ethereal, wispy place --- you know, with angelic choirs and harpists in the clouds and all that. Others imagine an existence in which the language will be biblical and the people will be religious, meaning, of course, boring. Still others take their view of heaven from the book of Revelation, where the description is --- come on, admit it --- pretty weird, from a human perspective. In short, DeStefano thinks all those images leave few people actually wanting to go there.    He remedies that by giving folks in the here and now a guided tour of the by and by. And while his basic take on heaven as a place conforms to fairly orthodox Christian teaching, he lets loose and lets his imagination run wild. Which, of course, also has gotten him into trouble with people who have somehow managed to confuse an imaginary romp through the afterlife with a doctrinal treatise on the same.    Look, the bottom line here is that this book is not for everyone, and DeStefano is quite cool with that. People who admit no creative thinking to their theological propositions should clearly stay away, as should people who might mistake A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN for the Gospel According to Anthony DeStefano. His breezy, casual writing style, punctuated by a truckload of exclamation points and question marks, won't appeal to everyone, either. But if you're still carrying around the image of a mind-numbing, stodgy, endless existence --- if you have absolutely no excitement about what's to come when this life is over for you --- well, you just might want to take a quick peek and see if you're up for taking the full tour.	2004-03-28

As he writes, &quot;Having tasted the sweet delights of liberty in Christ, more and more in the Christian family are satisfied with nothing less.&quot;<br />Renowned as a Christian communicator, Swindoll serves as senior pastor of Stonebriar Community Church, chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary and host of the internationally syndicated radio program &quot;Insight for Living.&quot; A prolific and award-winning author, he has written more than 30 bestselling books and received 11 Gold Medallion Awards, with this book qualifying as one of his best ever.<br />Exhibiting candor and conviction, Swindoll contrasts liberty with legalism and warns readers to be wary of the three tools of legalism, or grace-killers, as he calls them: doctrinal heresy, ecclesiastical harassment and personal hypocrisy. As he explains it, legalists disturb and distort by twisting truth, spying and enslaving, and lying and deceiving others.<br />In the chapter titled &quot;The Grace to Let Others Be,&quot; Swindoll compares the two different dimensions of grace. &quot;Vertical grace centers on our relationship to God. It is amazing. It frees us from the demands and condemnation of the Mosaic Law,&quot; he writes. &quot;Horizontal grace centers on our human relationships. It is charming. It frees us from the tyranny of pleasing people and adjusting our lives to the demands and expectations of human opinion.&quot;<br />To encourage readers as they awaken to grace, Swindoll reminds them that at least three things are involved in the process: it takes time, it requires pain and it means change. He also includes a helpful chart listing qualities of shame-based spirituality versus qualities of healthy spirituality, highlighting for readers the distinct differences between the two.<br />For those seeking specific guidance on how to be more gracious, Swindoll identifies five characteristics of people who personify grace: generosity with personal possessions, encouragement in unusual settings, life beyond the letter of the law, liberty for creative expression and release from past failures.<br />Readers will find the book an uplifting and liberating experience, as it gives them permission to be themselves in a healthy &quot;live and let live&quot; manner of speaking. While each one's pace may differ, Swindoll assures one and all that with God as the guide, the race to grace is a glorious one and well worth pursuing.<br />THE GRACE AWAKENING was originally released in 1990, selling more than 500,000 copies to date, and this version should succeed in widening its circle of influence even further. Its rousing message serves as a wake up call for all those who slumber under the lullaby of legalism yet yearn to be free. Read it and awaken to amazing, accepting grace.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-02-29

In 1883 he revealed a hard-to-believe prejudice: &quot;For a long time I used to say . . . that except in a graceful and minor way, women could not draw or paint.&quot; Ruskin then discounted this view, based on his reaction to the art of a young woman named Lilias Trotter: &quot;I'm beginning lately to bow myself to the much more delightful conviction that no one else can&quot; draw or paint.<br />In a 1960s book, RUSKIN TODAY, Sir Kenneth Clark mentioned Trotter as someone lost to history. But Clark hadn't turned over every leaf, as has biographer Miriam Rockness, who discovered Trotter through bequeathed volumes of her out-of-print illustrated books.<br />A bright, talented daughter of a prominent stockbroker in London, Lilias Trotter (1853-1928) was comfortable in the company of privilege. At age 21 she was among guests, including George MacDonald and Bishop Wilberforce, invited to a religious retreat, the forerunner of the Keswick Conferences.<br />Spiritually stirred by this and the preaching of Dwight Moody, Lilias grew discontent with the in-vogue &quot;charity from a distance.&quot; For more than 10 years in London, she devotedly worked to help establish a hostel for working women, the forerunner of the YWCA.<br />During this time, while on vacation in Venice, her meddling mother asked Ruskin to look at Lilias's watercolor paintings --- a request that led to art lessons, weekend invitations, and extended conversations and correspondence between the Miss and the Master, who claimed she could be the greatest painter of her generation if she would &quot;give herself up to art.&quot; To the dismay of many, Lilias turned her back on Ruskin's challenge: &quot;I cannot give myself to painting in the way he means and continue still to 'seek first the Kingdom of God.' &quot;<br />When Lilias was 35, this whole-spirited commitment dramatically &quot;called&quot; her to mission workin northern Africa. With two female colleagues --- none knowing Arabic, none robust enough to pass physicals required by established mission boards --- she sailed for Algeria, where she lived a life of saintly proportions until her death, at age 75.<br />Two-thirds of Rockness's biography delves into the Algerian years. Learning Arabic was the first of many challenges: Muslim resistance to a Christian message, French resistance to British interlopers, male resistance to a female witness. And yet under Trotter's leadership, the original missionary band and later recruits translated portions of scripture, distributed literature, befriended women and children, opened cafés for men, and hosted summer camps for nomadic families.<br />There are no imagined conversations in this book; there's no mistaking it for a novel. This is history, relying largely on journals, with some analysis and helpful foreshadowing. Ever aware of Lilias the artist, Rockness faithfully describes the palette of the desert so well that it's hard to distinguish Lilias the missionary from Lilias the artist.<br />In time Lilias envisioned a &quot;new approach to Arab literature&quot;: writings that would speak to Algerians, instead of what Trotter called the &quot;hitherto translated stories of Jacks &amp; Bobs whose surroundings are as foreign to children of the east as their names&quot; and finding an affordable means of color printing, so as to attract people who delighted in color. To meet these goals, Lilias wrote and illustrated nature parables that may soon be back in print, thanks to Rockness's persistence.<br />Some of the biography's most interesting material comes toward the end. In her last decade, Trotter won the respect of a group of Sufi (male) mystics. &quot;The artist in her responded to the artist in the Sufis,&quot; notes Rockness. &quot;Yet she never lost her spiritual focus.&quot; Confined to bed in the last two years, she wrote THE WAY OF THE SEVENFOLD SECRET, explaining to them seven &quot;I Am&quot; claims of Jesus --- as she managed what had become an extensive mission outreach.<br />Trotter's printed word and art can indeed inspire a new generation. But only those who knew her can appreciate &quot;perhaps her most palpable legacy&quot;: her love. As an obituary noted, &quot;No wonder that Catholics and Jews and Moslems, as well as Protestants, are mourning her loss, for love, in the end, wins love.&quot;<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-02-29

In her recently published memoir SING ME TO HEAVEN: The Story of a Marriage, Peterson does an exquisite job of explaining how both were true.<br />The short explanation is to say that Hyung Goo was HIV-positive. This revelation while the couple was dating threatened to dissolve their burgeoning romance for reasons that are all-too-obvious. But it was a combination of not-so-obvious reasons that ultimately brought the two together in marriage.<br />&quot;I wanted so desperately to know and be known, to love and be loved, and I had never met anyone with whom that seemed like the remotest possibility. I could sense that possibility already welling around the two of us. To have said to him at that point, 'I'm sorry; would you please go away' would have felt like cutting off my arm. I just couldn't do it.&quot;<br />Hyung Goo's HIV-positive status accounts for the worst part of falling in love with him. With heartbreaking detail, Peterson recounts their collective descent into the hell of hospitals and medicines and painful physical deterioration when Hyung Goo officially contracted AIDS and he began his halting march towards death. This aspect of the story alone is an incredibly valuable inside look at the real work of dying with a terminal illness.<br />But HIV also plays an unexpectedly large role in the best part of falling in love with Hyung Goo:<br />&quot;We began to see only gradually and toward the end of Hyung Goo's life the ways in which the present and anticipated grief of our marriage had contributed to the richness of our life together. The sorrows of our life had not simply detracted from our happiness, but had shaped and even contributed to that happiness. In the Spring of 1995, it was becoming clear that Hyung Goo was not going to live much longer --- maybe a year, probably less. In the midst of his worsening illness, he and I were coping togetherin much more cooperative and mutually supportive ways than in former days. 'It really is remarkable how far you two have come in just four years,' Martha commented to me.<br />She was right; but I wanted more. Where might we have been in ten years, if we had them?<br />'It's fruitless to ask that question,' Martha said. 'If you had ever thought you had that kind of time, you wouldn't be where you are now.'<br />It was impossible to see AIDS itself as good. But it was equally impossible to see that the particular good Hyung Goo and I had experienced together in the midst of AIDS could have been obtained in any other way. The requiem that we stand for one another and with one another was not something external to our marriage, like a piece of black crape draped over the frame of an otherwise sunny and cheerful picture. Our individual and shared sorrows were part of the picture itself, shadows without which the picture and its characteristic beauty would have been, if not gone, than at least altered beyond recognition.&quot;<br />Peterson's narrative provides an intimate and moving look at a marriage in which the looming specter of death brings present joy, love and sustaining faith into sharp relief. The couple ate dinner off their fine china every day at a table cluttered with hundreds, if not thousands, of pills and medicine bottles, reminding them why the special plates shouldn't be reserved for future occasions.<br />Listening to the Margaret of today reflect upon the Margaret of yesterday, it is clear Hyung Goo left her with the invaluable gift of an inculcated sense of self and stability. Indeed, the deeply therapeutic nature of this marriage is one of its most notable aspects:<br />&quot;We were both looking for a love affair when we began our courtship. We wanted affection and companionship and romance and we got them; but we got something far deeper and more transformative as well ... Like Max in WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, Hyung Goo wanted most just to be where someone loved him best of all. In our marriage he found that place. I couldn't have loved him more if there had been ten of me. And the more I loved him, and the more I relaxed into his love for me, the more worthwhile and competent he felt; until in the last year of his life he had settled into a confident, gentle, joyful, sense of himself as a man and as a husband.&quot;<br />There are love stories and then there are love stories. The former are as pleasant as they are predictable and they tend to be thoroughly forgettable. The latter earn their italics with uniquely honest depictions of the predicament of being in love. These tales have the ability to transcend their specifics to address larger issues of what it means to be human, and they have the uncanny ability to take up residence in the mind (and heart) of their readers. SING ME TO HEAVEN is a love story with italics.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-02-29

The world he knows fades to black at the sound of a gunshot --- and when Hunter comes around to consciousness again, he does so in a world as unlike the city he left as any place could be. From that point on, every time Hunter falls asleep in one reality, he wakes up in the other.    Eventually, in the futuristic new reality, Hunter is warned about a deadly virus that is about to be --- or rather, given the time frame, has been --- unleashed on the world in his other reality. With the assistance of his skeptical but medically knowledgeable sister, Hunter sets off on a mission to stop the unwitting manufacturers of the virus, who are the pawns in an international ploy that places the survival of the planet's entire population in the hands of a few power-hungry men who know the formula for the only thing that will stop the spread of the fatal disease.    One of Hunter's first stops on his mission is the offices of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and it's also one of the first places where the book begins to falter. As authentic as the setting is, the whole situation loses its credibility because of one fact: Hunter's visit to the CDC takes place on a Saturday, and there is no way on earth a government agency like the CDC is open on the weekend. (Trust me. I called.) We know it's a Saturday, by the way, because the Kentucky Derby is being run that day, which has more bearing on the plot than you might think.    What is credible is Hunter's absolute belief that the future reality is the real reality, and that his Denver-Atlanta-and-eventually-Bangkok world is his dream world. That may seem like a stretch, except to those people whose dreams are so real that they are absolutely convinced, while they're dreaming, that they're not dreaming. Like Hunter, some of us experience a dream world that is utterly tangible.    In thisother reality, Hunter is regularly given clues that will help him in his effort to stop the release of the airborne virus into the environment. I suspect Dekker has been reading John Eldredge lately, because he gives Hunter a mission that contains all the elements of a WILD AT HEART quest, right down to rescuing the \\"beauty.\\" In the future reality, the playful beauty not only wants Hunter to rescue her but also controls the way he is to do it, to a point. In present-day reality, the beauty's very survival depends on being rescued.    BLACK is the first of a three-part trilogy and thus ends with something of a cliffhanger. (The other two titles, RED and WHITE, are scheduled for release between now and September.) But the problem with fantasy is this: Once the reader knows that natural laws no longer apply, the suspense begins to dissipate. So when a guy is shot at point-blank range, well, it tends to not mean a whole lot.    Dekker fans, particularly those who are into fantasy and especially those who don't mind less-than-subtle salvation imagery, will likely consider this to be one of his better books, if not his best. And the alternate reality motif does work well in BLACK. But in an anything-goes fantasy world, disbelief becomes permanently suspended --- along with any sense of impending danger.	2004-02-29

After a rough beginning, the couple and their two children eventually came to appreciate the area's diversity and continued working toward racial reconciliation, particularly through the nearly all-white church to which they belonged.    And then one night, when Steve was at a church meeting and the rest of the family was asleep, a knife-wielding black man entered their house through an unlocked door, confronted Heather, threatened to kill her and the children if she did not submit to him, and raped her. Though the shame of the attack tempted her to keep silent --- she blamed herself, as many rape victims do --- Heather faced an unimaginably difficult decision, one that forced her to immediately tell a few people close to her about the rape.    A vocal opponent of abortion, she had 72 hours to decide if she should take Ovral, a post-intercourse pill intended to prevent conception. To Heather, the medication at first sounded too much like an abortion pill. With the encouragement of her pastor, her friends, her mother (who later changed her mind), and most of all, Steve, Heather swallowed the pill.    But the Ovral failed. The rape had coincided with the most fertile period in Heather's cycle, and she discovered she was pregnant with what could only be the rapist's child. What's more, she needed regular testing done to determine if the attack had made her HIV-positive.    Gemmen's telling of the story is at once compelling and exasperating. On the compelling side, it's a truly remarkable story of trauma and uncertainty that is eventually overcome by love and restoration. The decisions the couple had to make, in the context of their faith in God, their devotion to their young sons and their commitment to racial reconciliation, were the kind that would threaten to tearapart the fabric of many a family, just as the situation itself threatened to divide their community and their church. In recounting her story, Gemmen reconstructs conversations, which lends a sense of immediacy that enhances the narration.    On the exasperating side, the book's odd prologue is difficult to follow at first, the author's sometimes peculiar word choices are jarring (one woman is described as having a \\"stylish exterior\\"), and there are too many mistakes and omissions of the kind that an editor should have caught. Gemmen offhandedly mentions that Steve, whom she met in college, wanted her to remain in the U.S. rather than return to her \\"native land\\" after graduation; a later description of her as a Canuck provides the only indication that she's from Canada.    There's also no sense of where these people live until late in the book, when they move to Colorado and are forced to send a foster child back to Michigan. That's the kind of thing that makes readers scratch their heads and wonder if they missed something earlier on.    Exasperation aside, Gemmen's book will undoubtedly minister not only to rape victims but also to victims of any sudden and violent trauma. And its message of the power of redeeming love --- the kind of love that transforms hideousness into beauty --- is likely to impact even those readers who cannot fathom the horror of the Gemmens' ordeal.	2004-02-29

Can I get an &quot;amen&quot;?<br />Dave Ramsey, radio talk show host, author and all-around financial guru, is no stranger to this ostrich routine. After his own bankruptcy he came to the conclusion that the key to financial (and physical) fitness isn't knowing all the tricks of the money trade; it's being honest with yourself. &quot;If I can control the guy in the mirror, I can be skinny and rich,&quot; he says in his new book THE TOTAL MONEY MAKEOVER.<br />In other words, you have to get your head out of the sand. Okay, I have to get my head out of the sand.<br />Leaving the skinny to other books, Ramsey is a prophet to those who want to be rich but would settle for being financially stable. It's clear that this is a large group, given the popularity of Ramsey's radio show and books. After reading THE TOTAL MONEY MAKEOVER, I can see why they flock to him for advice.<br />Ramsey's principles are simple and straightforward. Pay cash. Pay off debts from smallest to largest. Create an emergency fund. He provides easy-to-understand answers to many seemingly complex questions about budgeting, retirement funds, saving for college education, and more.<br />Large pullout quotes scattered throughout the book offer bite-sized financial advice and factoids in Ramsey's typically direct manner:<br />&quot;A new $28,000 car will lose about $17,000 of value in the first four years you own it. To get the same result, you could toss a $100 bill out the window once a week during your commute.&quot;<br />&quot;Looking to spend $100 per month on life insurance? You could pay $7 a month toward term insurance and invest the remaining $93. But go with a cash-value policy if you'd rather have someone else earn interest on your investments.&quot;<br />&quot;49% of Americans could cover less than one months' expenses if they lost their income.&quot;<br />&quot;If your mortgage payment is $900 and the interest portion is $830, you will pay that year around $10,000 in interest. What a great tax deduction! Right? Otherwise, you'd pay $3,000 in taxes on that $10,000. But who in their right mind would chose to trade $10,000 for $3,000?&quot;<br />All of this advice is helpful and eye opening, but what Ramsey really excels at is presenting inspirational tales of those who were once, but are no longer, in financial disarray. Their stories make up at least a third of the book, and the cumulative effect is that of a published pep rally designed to get people pumped up about saving money. And it works.<br />This is a must-read book for anyone whose looking for a little basic financial information and a whole lot of courage to finally put away the ostrich suit.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-02-29

While Hatcher had accepted Christ in 1976, in the early 1990s she began to walk closer with Jesus, and she began reading inspirational fiction. She realized that she wanted to write novels that fit her new ideals and that some of her previous books could be tailored to fit her new writing model. Thus, her latest book, CATCHING KATIE, is her fifth &quot;redeemed&quot; one (Hatcher's term), an update of KISS ME, KATIE that incorporates a strong faith story into its romance.<br />Katie Jones is a graduate of Vassar College and has spent several years in Washington, D.C. lobbying on behalf of women's suffrage. She decides to move back home to Idaho, a state that had granted women suffrage in the late 19th century, in order to build momentum there --- and perhaps a platform for her own ambitions, although she's not completely aware of them as she rattles into the town of Homestead in her newfangled Model T Ford, nicknamed &quot;Susan B&quot; after Katie's hero.<br />What she is aware of is her burning desire to accomplish her goal of universal suffrage, and she doesn't consider what anyone else will think as she begins to do so. Her dear childhood friend, Ben Rafferty, is now the editor of the Homestead Herald, and Katie immediately &quot;applies&quot; to write a column about the subject closest to her heart. However, before she knows what's happening, that subject of her heart has changed --- it's become Ben. His former engagement broken off, it seems there's nothing to stand in the way of the childhood sweethearts getting married. In fact, they do (I won't spoil why, or how), but that doesn't solve the real dilemma for Katie, which is how to reconcile her feminist principles with marriage.<br />Hatcher tackles this subject head-on, by providing insight into the historyof women's rights and by grounding Katie in a solid, no-nonsense pioneer Christian spirituality. Pioneer tradition had to acknowledge women as powerful and equal, because the work of building towns like Homestead couldn't have been done without them. It's small wonder that Idaho had early women's suffrage, and it's small wonder that Katie has no qualms about being seen as equal to men before marriage.<br />Of course, given the opinions of so many around her and given the culture of her era, Katie finds that once she and Ben are married in the eyes of God and man, she has a much more difficult time understanding herself. Fortunately, Hatcher helps the reader understand all sides of the issue, and grounds the conclusion in Scriptural as well as historical terms (for example, she demonstrates that many serious Christian women were also serious suffragettes; the movement was not filled with atheists and agnostics).<br />While Hatcher herself clearly believes that Christian marriage is about mutual submission and not about male dominance, she also clearly believes in the primacy of her relationship with Jesus Christ. Even readers who disagree with her views on men and women will find this tale of a bubbly young lady growing into womanhood a delightful and fresh take on the historical romance.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-02-29

Already we've sat through acceptance speeches at the Golden Globes and the Grammys. The Oscars, grand poomba of all award shows, is fast approaching. So this is the perfect time to pick up a book about movies!<br />HOW MOVIES HELPED SAVE MY SOUL: Finding Spiritual Fingerprints in Culturally Significant Films, by Gareth Higgins, is the newest addition to a growing number of Christian books dedicated to exploring religious themes in film. Brought to us by Relevant Books, an upstart publisher with its finger planted firmly on the pulse of 20-something Christians, this book displays the innate comfort post-modern Christians have discussing movies and their power to positively influence personal lives. This is notable because many older Christians can remember a time when mainstream moviegoing was widely recognized as taboo.<br />As one might surmise from the title, Higgins' approach to the subject of movies is as much about memoir as it is criticism. Some of his earliest memories are of his dad taking him and his brother to the movies, beginning his lifelong love of the big screen: &quot;Film is so wrapped up with the fabric of my life that, along with the community of friends and family with whom I'm blessed to travel, I simply cannot explain myself without it.&quot;<br />Like listening to a veteran bibliophile list off his or her favorite books, it's daunting to realize how many movies Higgins has viewed in his relatively short lifetime. If I got started right now I'm not sure I'd catch up! Thankfully, I don't have to catch up and the encyclopedic roster of movies Higgins has seen is clearly an asset to this book.<br />Higgins chose to sort through his ideas about movies by organizing his thoughts into chapters on big themes such as Justice, God, Community, Brokenness, Outsiders, Death, Fear, and so on. In each chapter he presents a relatively detailed critique of two or three movies he thinks best explore the subject at hand. Whatfollows varies from chapter to chapter, but it generally involves lists of additional suggested movies and his musings.<br />This book is a much-needed departure from what has been, until recently, the standard format for Christian movie criticism --- counting all the bad words. Perhaps such simple criticism does have its place, but Higgins does an excellent job of pointing readers to the ways movies, even those with bad words, can reveal striking portraits of grace and faith and hope:<br />&quot;Who among us has not felt at least in microcosm the anguished courage of a William Wallace in Braveheart, or identified with the last minute redemption of a Lester Brunham in American Beauty, or suffered the torment of a Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II, on realizing that what we thought we controlled was actually controlling us? Film, in the final analysis, can do for you what all great art does --- irritate and heal, challenge and affirm, inspire and sadden. It can, in the case of a film like Magnolia, truly give you more life, or as in Wings of Desire, make you believe in God, or as with The Wizard of Oz, tell you the truth about your own existence.&quot;<br />HOW MOVIES HELPED SAVE MY SOUL is weak when it strays from its understood mission. Far too often it leaves both movie criticism and memoir and turns into a soapbox for Higgins' ideas about community and the death penalty and the institutional church and whatever else he's inspired to preach about. Loose writing also creates the cumulative effect that Higgins is rambling at times, as opposed to providing tangible insight.<br />The most helpful chapter in the book is the first, titled &quot;Dr. Higgins' Rosetta Stone.&quot; In it he gives a brief primer on how to move from being a passive moviegoer to an informed amateur critic with the ability to mine movies for all they're worth. Some of his suggestions are probably a bit too involved for most would-be amateur critics (I don't know many who would spend themoney and time to subscribe to and read &quot;a decent, intelligent but accessible film magazine&quot; as he suggests), but many more of them are excellent and simple ways to make moviegoing more interesting and beneficial.<br />This book could be a great tool with which to start your own movie club. People get together and talk about books, so why not do the same with movies? I'll bring the popcorn!<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-02-29

The answer surprises Jay Jarvis again and again in this quirky male's-eye-view of the Christian singles scene.<br />Once a male friend said to me &quot;I didn't know what I was here for until I had a child.&quot; One might debate his statement, but it does illuminate part of the challenge of being a modern man. In an era and society in which the role of men has changed drastically, young men like my friend are searching for meaning. Ray Blackston's protagonist, Jay Jarvis, is also searching for meaning in his life --- or, at least, a girlfriend. But when a move from Dallas to Greenville, South Carolina finds him trolling the local churches for female companionship, Jay gets much, much more than he bargained for.<br />Jay, like his creator is a stockbroker, who has just been unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, and on the advice of his realtor decides to try a church service instead of a dating service. Before he know what's hit him, Jay is meeting with the young men's group at the church and taking a Memorial Day beach trip with them (19 men, 34 women, a gross or two of Oreos). He's also met a churchmember named Ally who spends most of her time in the mission fields of Ecuador --- but enough time at home so that her verbal sparring and fast-food-throwing skills haven't been dulled. Before you can jump a pew, Jay is smitten. He and Ally become so engrossed in getting to know each other that they float off course in inner tubes and are forced to spend a night alone on a beach.<br />However, this is a Christian novel, and while that night on the beach causes some sheepish consternation for the pair, it doesn't involve anything else. What makes Flabbergasted so fresh and refreshing is Jay's unchurched perspective. When he arrives in Greenville, he has very little knowledge of what is means to be an adult Christian, and this causes him (and others) no endof confusion.<br />Blackston has not chosen to have his main character poke fun at others at their expense; it's all really at Jay's expense, since he's entered a world where church rules. That doesn't mean, as he soon discovers, that there isn't any fun to be had. Even when Ally returns to South America, Jay has dates to go on, meetings to attend, and all manner of funny, lively characters to meet. His new church-centered life is far from boring.<br />Yet his yearning for Ally remains strong despite the lure of other charming young woman at home, and soon Jay finds himself visiting Ecuador --- and discovering that Ally has reserves and qualities he never imagined. This is no boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl story --- but it has all of the spark of one.

Winner talked about her conversion from Orthodox Judaism to Christianity and her attempts to bridge the two religions by letting her Jewish faith inform her new Christian faith. After seven years as a Christian, MUDHOUSE SABBATH finds Winner exploring eleven Jewish spiritual practices and traditions that she finds indispensable to her Christian life. In short, she finds herself returning to her roots. &quot;This is a book about those things I miss,&quot; she writes. &quot;It is, to be blunt, about spiritual practices that Jews do better. It is, to be blunter, about Christian practices that would be enriched, that would be thicker and more vibrant, if we took a few lessons from Judaism.&quot;<br />This slim volume, noteworthy for Winner's engaging voice and lucid prose (one wonders if she could rewrite the &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; and make them intriguing) is full of personal anecdotes mixed with spiritual musings. For Jews, action is the heart of faith, she writes. While she acknowledges &quot;spiritual practices don't justify us. They don't save us,&quot; she realizes that the practicing of the spiritual disciplines &quot;teaches us how to live as Christians.&quot;<BR>  <BR>Of all the Jewish practices, observing &quot;Shabbat&quot; or the Sabbath is the one Winner says she misses the most. A little aimless without the framework of the Jewish Sabbath of her past, she often spends her Sunday afternoons with a cup of hot chai and a good book at the Mudhouse, a coffee shop in Charlottesville, &quot;not at all sure that I have opened my heart in any particular way.&quot; As she seeks to remedy this, she looks at the capitalistic misconception of the Sabbath --- &quot;resting one day a week makes you more productive during the other six&quot; --- and finds that it is at odds with the spirit of Shabbat. Rather than honoring ourselves, in observing the Sabbath &quot;one is both giving a gift to God and imitating Him,&quot;she writes. For Winner, this realization brings about changes. She joins a Sunday Bible study, visits shut-ins, and forswears Sunday shopping (&quot;A bigger sacrifice than you may realize!&quot;). Nothing earthshaking, but important growth in faith journeys often starts with these types of small steps.<br />Winner also discusses spiritual disciplines such as fasting, prayer and hospitality; rites of passage including weddings, aging and mourning; traditions such as candle-lighting and affixing symbols of faith to doorposts; and more esoteric things such as our view of the body and making good food choices. She avoids romanticizing her past (kashrut or &quot;keeping kosher,&quot; she admits can at times be &quot;a royal pain in the neck&quot;), while refusing to spare her new faith from critique (&quot;Liturgy can be dull, and its dullness can be distracting&quot;). Winner then flips the coin and looks at the positives --- when she kept kosher, she brought thought and intention to what she ate; when she uses her prayer book, she is freed from her narcissism and repointed toward confession, praise and a concern for others. There's a balance here that was likely difficult to achieve between acknowledging the most desirable traditions of her past and embracing the best of her new faith.<br />As of the writing of the book, Winner was working on a doctorate in the history of American religion from Columbia University. Although she's an academic, her scholarship is evident in her understanding of where and why some of the practices of Judaism and Christianity evolved. The glossary included is helpful in understanding unfamiliar Jewish or Yiddish words that appear in various chapters. But unlike many books written by academics, her knowledge is an almost invisible underpinning for the text, her prose is free of jargon and her voice is conversational. Readers will feel as if they are chatting over coffee with a long-time friend.<br />Toward the end of GIRL MEETS GOD we find Winner, who had gotten rid of most of her Jewish commentaries and books, rebuilding her Jewish library. In MUDHOUSE SABBATH, she likewise begins adding back into her new faith those essential &quot;volumes&quot; that she had left behind that she now finds necessary for a deeper relationship with God. Although unabashedly Christian, Winner is evenhanded in her treatment of both faiths: both obviously dear to her, both important to her understanding of God. Readers who long for a deeper sense of tradition and more vibrant, active faith practices will find Winner's book a good place for reflection.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-01-24

And now you know my secret --- that even though I could be called a snob when it comes to fiction, I have a soft spot for fast-paced global political thrillers in which Americans are always the good guys. It's my own form of escapism.<br />That's why when I read that Joel C. Rosenberg's latest book was &quot;Clancyesque&quot; it was a good omen in my eyes. Indeed, THE LAST DAYS, the bestselling sequel to the bestselling THE LAST JIHAD, is a breathless geopolitical roller coaster ride. It follows on the heels of THE LAST JIHAD's war on terrorism plotline to focus on the potential for peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors.<br />The cast of characters is familiar to readers of THE LAST JIHAD and Jon Bennett, Wall Street strategist come senior White House advisor, takes the lead as the architect of a plan for peace between Israel and Palestine. Its basis? Vast oil reserves found in the region stand to make every Palestinian and Israeli man, woman and child wealthy beyond their dreams if they can just learn to work together.<br />Assassinations and attempted assassinations ensue. A Palestinian civil war breaks out and several shadowy groups with their own interests do their best to wreak havoc with attacks on sensitive locals such as the Dome of the Rock and Washington D.C. Admittedly, for reasons I'll talk about in a moment, I wanted to put this book down. But I couldn't. I was hooked and had to know what would happen next. Perhaps my biggest endorsement of the book would be the fact that I stayed up until 3AM to finish it.<br />One of the ways Rosenberg creates the narrative vortex that sucks you in is by warping the timeline and populating his story with real people in imaginary places. As the story opens the war in Iraq has just ended. Saddam Hussein is dead. His sons are dead. And the year is 2010. Huh? Didn't most of this just happen a few months ago? You don't even realize that it's 2010 until later on in the story. By then you're also scratching your head at the appearances of Abu Mazen as prime minister of Palestine. In the real world Mazen relinquished the role several months ago in 2003. And while the president in 2010 is the imagined James MacPherson, references to the real President George W. Bush, officials in his current administration and their policies also add to a sense of reality that is slightly askew. I'll warn you: for a few days after reading THE LAST DAYS the stuff of the nightly news will seem so seven years ago.<br />The reason I wanted to put the book down stems from what I perceived as Rosenberg's conservative political agenda. As a sometimes-conservative evangelical Christian with Jewish roots, I share a lot of the affections of the author. I like democracy. I like Israel. At the same time, I'm generally critical of those who use fiction to make a point that could be made more honestly in a nonfiction arena.<br />The tip-off to me that this might be the case with THE LAST DAYS is its cellophane-thin characters, the most offending of whom is Jon Bennett's bodyguard and romantic foil Erin McCoy, an &quot;Uzi-toting, Arabic-speaking CIA supermodel.&quot; Please. The characters are at their strongest when they're engaged in action --- running through rat-infested sewers or trying to escape the Rock of Gibraltar --- which, thankfully, is the bulk of the book.<br />Dialogue is a weakness. When the characters start talking about the issues or where extended attention is given to their inner thoughts, everyone is the straw man for Rosenberg's ideas and perspective. In contrast Tom Clancy, conservative though he may be, has a habit of creating rich characters with minds of their own. Neither author writes what I would consider life-changing fiction, but Clancy is the more honest storyteller. Having said this, I think Rosenberg is consciously trying to represent perspectives other than his own --- this is admirable --- and shares with Clancy the ability to keep the reader engaged.<br />THE LAST DAYS benefits greatly from the author's intimate knowledge of the Middle East and his understanding of the competing interests in the region and the Washington D.C. political machine. His vision of the potential for peace in the near future in the Holy Land is intriguing. And while I think that the thin substance of the story is better suited for a two-hour movie (one I would go see), the larger time investment required to read this book won't detour many from burning the midnight oil to see what happens next.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-01-24

Set in the fictional Amish community of Gobbler's Knob circa 1947, this is the second installment in the &quot;Abram's Daughters&quot; series and continues the story of the Amish Ebersol sisters --- Sadie, Leah, and twins Mary Ruth and Hannah. The stories of these courting-age girls are woven together, but Leah's narrative takes center stage through the course of this installment.<br />As the story opens, Sadie and Leah are both dealing with the continued fallout of Sadie's irresponsible behavior during &quot;rumschpringe,&quot; a period of time in which young Amish people are given the freedom to explore the outside world to determine whether or not they want to be baptized and commit their lives to the &quot;Plain&quot; way of life. Sadie's downward spiral is chronicled in THE COVENANT, and it's clear her descent is not complete, as anger and sadness eat away at her in THE BETRAYAL.<br />&quot;After their private talk Sadie had gone inside and created a fuss, all because Mamma had suggested Sadie take herself upstairs and lie down. 'You look so hot in the face,' Mamma had said sweetly, offering a concerned smile, no doubt noticing Sadie's swollen eyes.<br />'I'm all right, really,' Sadie replied.<br />'Just thought a rest might do you good.'<br />Then Sadie burst out crying. 'I'll go out to the pasture if you say to --- coax all the cows home for milking --- do Leah's chores, but I won't be resting!'<br />Both Hannah and Mamma gasped, though Mamma the louder. 'Such foolish words, Sadie dear. Time you behaved like a baptized church member ... and bite your tongue.'<br />Sadie brushed her tears away, standing there silent now.<br />'You best go to your room,' Mamma insisted. 'Tis not becomin' of you to disobey.'<br />Suddenly Sadie brushed past Mamma and Leah, breaking into an all-out run. Out the back door and down the steps she went, toward the barnyard.&quot;<br />As Sadie seems to be pulling away from the only life that she's known, Leah decides to get baptized and marry her devoted childhood sweetheart, Jonas Mast. A rift between the sisters develops despite their love for one another, and the whole family is thrown into tumult. Secrets both large and small abound in the Ebersol household, and Leah and Jonas's union ends up in jeopardy. In the end it's unclear which betrayal THE BETRAYAL refers to --- Leah of Sadie or Sadie of Leah.<br />Lewis grew up in Lancaster County, and her body of work shows an obvious affection for the Amish way of life. Her stories are often set among the Plain people, and her descriptions of their everyday lives are idyllic. THE BETRAYAL is no different, and fans of Lewis are likely to embrace her newest novel despite its somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying ending.

Books	4	17	17	N	N	A Compelling Work with an Abundance of Information	Bestselling author Philip Yancey writes that he penned RUMORS OF ANOTHER WORLD to reflect on what he would say if asked to explain his faith to an unbeliever. But he admits, &quot;I wrote it not so much to convince anyone else as to think out loud in hopes of coming to terms with my own faith,&quot; and indeed this book invites Christians as well as unbelievers to look at faith in a fresh way.<br />For Yancey, the great divide separating belief and unbelief can be reduced to one question: Is the visible world around us all there is? Those unsure of the answer, he writes, are in the &quot;borderlands of belief&quot; --- a place between doubt and faith --- a term he credits writer Mark Buchanan with coining. Yancey sets out to explain why he believes that there is indeed an unseen world, invisible and supernatural. &quot;What are we missing? What do we not see, for lack of imagination or faith?&quot;<br />To find out what he was missing, Yancey began to listen to his own longings and desires, tracing &quot;dispersed clues (or rumors) to their original source and significance.&quot; Then, he opened his heart to the invisible world and experienced what he calls his second conversion: rediscovering the natural world from a new viewpoint. Through classical music, the beauties of nature and romantic love, Yancey discovered new windows to the supernatural.<br />However, we often ignore these and other windows to the invisible world. Because the Creator doesn't impose himself on us, Yancey writes that it requires &quot;attention and effort&quot; on our part to remember him. He writes of simple things he is doing to perceive the rumors more clearly: from observing the attractions of nature outside the windows of his mountain home in Colorado, to learning from Jesus how to be fully present to others rather than considering them as interruptions. Yancey seeks to find something of lasting value in mundane tasks (alá Brother Lawrence): &quot;Did I treat the airline ticketing agent, the UPS driver, my readers, with the attention they deserve?&quot; And in doing so, Yancey glimpses the relationship that matters the most, and names his goal for growing older: &quot;to care less about how others view me and more about how God views me.&quot;<br />In his self-examinations, he is relentlessly vulnerable. As Yancey plumbs the question of disorder --- &quot;in short, if there is another world out there, shouldn't this one give more evidence of it?&quot; --- he examines the sins that he wrestles with most often: discontent, hypocrisy, pride and greed. However, he no longer envisions God as a cosmic police officer, keeping him from doing things he would enjoy. Rather, he sees God &quot;as a Spirit within, coaxing me to realize fully what I was created to be in the first place.&quot;<br />Yancey writes that he thinks out loud by putting words on paper, and this is in full evidence in RUMORS OF ANOTHER WORLD. As with many great writers confronted with the mystery of faith, he often asks more questions than he answers. One Yancey trademark is that he liberally salts the text with quoted material, which can be enriching for the reader who is introduced to new authors of interest. These include many of the crème de la crème of authors both classic and contemporary: Annie Dillard, Frederick Buechner, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Simon Weil, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Thomas Merton, Jonathan Edwards, Thomas à Kempis. It is difficult to think of better company to keep while wrestling with questions of faith.<br />However, this abundance of quoted material also means the reading is slower-paced. RUMORS OF ANOTHER WORLD, like most Yancey books, is best consumed by sipping rather than gulping; underlining and highlighting rather than skimming.<br />There is much to be underlined and highlighted; many insights that demand deeper personal reflection. As Yancey looks both inward and outward, listening for clues about the God he longs to know more intimately, he invites us--- compellingly --- to open our own hearts to the invisible world.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-01-24

This woman had run up something like $100,000 in unsecured debt (credit cards and such) and worked her way out of that crushing load of debt, without a high-paying job or an inheritance or a windfall of any kind. She simply persevered.    Of course, that's only half of the story. The other half involves her husband who, of all things, was a banker during some of the time she was amassing a heavy debt load. Like many spouses, she kept thinking she could handle it --- she would figure something out, or some magic reversal would wipe out their debt. Really, it's a wonder they didn't duke it out once she decided to come clean with him.    The plan Hunt outlines in DEBT-PROOF YOUR MARRIAGE is legitimately workable, for all you skeptics who think hers is just another budgeting plan that will never work for you. She doesn't propose living in a tent and boiling roots to make tea, though she probably wouldn't try to stop you. While she gives lots of very specific, very detailed information on how to eliminate credit card debt quickly, how to pay off your mortgage early and how to create a spending plan that is based on freedom rather than restriction, she is careful to emphasize that couples must customize their financial plan to fit their lifestyle and temperaments.    Hunt writes in a friendly, nonjudgmental style. I doubt anyone could come away from this book feeling worse than they did when they started reading. Hunt is a master at encouraging people to do what they can do, a little at a time, rather than feeling they have to grovel over their shameful financial mismanagement. She uses humor, anecdotes and illustrations to underscore the serious point she's making: that financial disharmony can destroy a marriage, while financial harmony --- no matter what it takes to achieve it --- can strengthen and save a marriage.    Before she getsinto practical matters, Hunt establishes a foundation for understanding the factors that result in money-related problems in a marriage by discussing emotional differences, myths about money, and marital problems that are exacerbated by financial conflict. She pretty much follows a conservative Christian blueprint for marriage, conflict resolution and the like.    About the only thing that leaves me cold are the sections on making deposits in a \\"Love Bank\\" --- the idea being that every little thing you do to show your love and respect for your spouse is deposited into an account that incrementally adds up to a significant balance. I don't know. Maybe some couples like to talk and think like that. I've just never met one, or one that openly discusses it. Anyway, this idea isn't original with Hunt; she attributes it to Willard Harley, so her only responsibility for it is in repeating it. Oh, and then there is the implied suggestion that engaged couples exchange credit reports. I'm not sure why I find that so, well, weird. It's not like I think it's too personal; maybe I just can't see a couple actually doing that.    You probably won't agree with all of Hunt's suggestions, and you probably won't get around to following all of her advice even if you want to. But there's enough here to make the book a wise investment. And if you'd like to contribute to the lofty goal of reducing the divorce rate, you might want to consider giving a copy to every engaged couple you know.	2004-01-24

In the intervening years, many Christian authors have added an \\"amen!\\" to Manning's message about the need for authenticity and vulnerability before God and other people. His, however, is one of those rare books that stands up to repeated readings. The addition of a thoughtful study guide, written by the author, should make this particular edition attractive not only to new readers but also to longtime fans.    Manning begins by beckoning Christians to come out of hiding, the place to which we retreat out of shame or guilt in the misguided belief that God is berating us as harshly as we are berating ourselves. In that place of hiding, we further nurture our false self, which the author calls \\"the impostor\\" --- also the title of the chapter that has generated more responses than all the other chapters combined, Manning writes in the preface to the revised edition. Apparently, it's an image that resonates with a lot of readers.    Our masks, our pretenses, our hypocrisy, our outward displays of saintliness, Manning contends, rob us of the thing we crave the most: intimacy with God the Father. That intimacy is far more attainable than we can possibly imagine as we refuse to come out from hiding and expose our true selves to God, to other people, and most of all, to ourselves. It is only when we shed our false identity and accept the unconditional love of our Abba --- our heavenly \\"Daddy\\" --- that we can experience the passionate love relationship with Him that we have long craved.    Manning's gift as an author lies in his often brutal honesty about his own failures. That's what sets his works apart from those of so many other Christian leaders, the ones who preach authenticity but admit only to their prettier and pettier and less frequent \\"mistakes.\\" Manning is unafraid to expose in print his own sins, including those that are ugly, major and chronic. As a result, he has earned the right to speak into the lives of people who need to be equally transparent with God about the ugly, major and chronic sins they try so hard to keep hidden.    Now for the \\"I wish he hadn't written that and I suspect he does too\\" part: Manning uses the term \\"inner child,\\" which was a whole lot more acceptable in the early '90s, although there were plenty of us who cringed whenever we heard the phrase even back then. And while it may rankle our present-day sensibilities, it's easy enough to get past. But newcomers to ABBA'S CHILD --- particularly those who are unaware that the original text is 10 years old --- need to understand the context of the time in which it was written. \\"Inner Pharisee\\" is another term that might sound a bit dated. However, since the inner Pharisee is still very much alive and kicking and doing its dirty work in us --- don't ask me how I know this --- that phrase probably warrants continued usage.    Those who have come face to face with their own brokenness --- and those who need to --- will find both comfort and hope in ABBA'S CHILD, particularly through its many memorable anecdotes and illustrations, such as the story of the \\"rabbi's heartbeat\\" --- which became the title of another Manning book that was released earlier this year. Saturated with the themes of God's grace and love, ABBA'S CHILD is one of those treasured books that manages to be profound, challenging, convicting and delightful, all at once.	2004-01-24

This latest installment is no exception. The narrative revolves around Father Tim's restoration of an old, battered nativity set, which he hopes to complete for his wife Cynthia as a surprise for Christmas. As he painstakingly sands the plaster figures, uncovering their natural beauty, he also uncovers a surprising talent for working creatively with his hands. When a nativity piece must be discarded because it is damaged beyond repair, Father Tim also discards some of his fondest dreams for the future --- and creates some new ones. The restoration of the figures becomes symbolic of Father Tim's personal restoration as he enjoys his retirement. &quot;He felt a happy contentment flowing up in him, as a spring from a hidden source,&quot; Karen writes. Meanwhile, Cynthia is busy with her own Christmas surprise, which will offer Father Tim some consolation after a desolating accident.<br />There's something especially endearing about the late-in-life love between Father Tim and Cynthia, who are aging well, yet aging nonetheless. With poignancy, Father Tim discovers that one of the gifts of growing old is recapturing lost memories. He finds himself reminiscing about past Christmases with his mother and father, and remembering the lonely and imaginative child that he had been. Some tender recollections of his indifferent father also resurface. A solid underpinning of hope anchors all of the Mitford novels, and the hope SHEPHERDS ABIDING offers seems to be that the last part of life is to be anticipated.<br />But this is no serious Christmas tale. As with all of the Mitford novels, there's plenty of gentle humor. &quot;Just think! All that misery over taxes,&quot; Cynthia observes of the holy family's journey to Bethlehem. Father Tim answers, &quot;Some things never change.&quot; <br />And indeed, in some ways, life hasn't changed much in Mitford, although the characters are older and their circumstances are a little different. Dooley Barlowe is away at university, and Louella Baxter Marshall is at Hope House retirement center, baking biscuits and ordering her Christmas presents online. Uncle Billy and Rose Watson exemplify committed love in the face of hardship. The search continues for Dooley's missing little brother Kenny, which will likely be wrapped up in the last book of the series.<br />A few changes are afoot. The Grill is closing, and there's a light shining through the windows above the Happy Endings bookstore, now the home of its new owner. Puny is pregnant with twins --- again. However, there is a sense that the series is winding down, and the Mitford years are drawing toward a gentle close. After bringing more than 15 million copies of Karon's books to readers, Viking will publish THE MITFORD COOKBOOK AND KITCHEN READER next year; then the last novel in the Mitford series, LIGHT FROM HEAVEN, in 2005.<br />The endearing nature of SHEPHERDS ABIDING, as with other Mitford titles, is that you find a point of connection to all its characters. Father Tim is the pastor you've always wanted; Uncle Billy and his aging wife Rose are the eccentric elderly relatives the family jokes about but loves; Hope is the single gal everyone is rooting for to find a guy who deserves her; and Dooley is that kid who came from bad circumstances, but you know has promise. Through Karon's eyes, Mitford is really our town --- like Andy Griffith's Mayberry, it is full of homespun wisdom plunked down with enough subtlety to make it palatable, but still obvious enough that we don't miss it. Readers should find SHEPHERDS ABIDING a peaceful entrée into the Christmas season, and an enjoyable read all year round.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-01-24

Given the secular suspense novels all over bookstores chockfull of gore, sex and expletives, I couldn't imagine how Hannah Alexander would put together a story without them. What would the main conflict be --- that the church coffee hour ran out of sugar?<br />Like all sinners who confess, I must now admit my wrongdoing: HIDEAWAY, while gentle, is a well paced, suspenseful read. That bag of missing sugar hasn't been poured into Alexander's prose, either; the novel isn't treacly. Even the requisite adorable elderly country couple, Bertie and Red, are rendered clearly. Bertie, given to concoctions of roots and herbs, isn't made to seem like a fount of wisdom or like a Wiccan-on-the-edge; instead, her homemade remedies are place in counterpoint to Cheyenne Allison's medical training.<br />Cheyenne Allison, a thirtysomething ER doctor, has retreated to colleague Ardis Dunaway's home in the Ozark town of Hideaway, Missouri, after her sister is in a car accident and dies on her watch. Without giving away too much of the plot, it's important to know that Allison has inner demons pursuing her, and outer ones too, in the form of a lawsuit. She thinks the quiet of country life and the challenge of helping to spruce up her friend's ramshackle house will be all that she needs to fill up her life while she recovers.<br />But soon she is meeting the neighbors: Dane Gideon, who runs a ranch for troubled teen boys, his ward Gavin, or \\"Blaze,\\" the aforementioned Bertie and Red, Mayor Austin Barlow and his son Ramsay, and other people curious about the lone woman from the big city of Columbia. Before she can say \\"How quaint!\\" Allison finds herself aiding Gideon, tutoring Blaze, treating Red, and fending off Barlow. Her quiet period of recovery soon turns into an eventful sabbatical that leaves her wondering if she really wants to go back to what she once had.<br />Some of the events seem flat. For example, as the book gains speed, accidents and incidents tumble so quickly over each other that when Blaze is badly electrocuted by a ground wire, the injury almost fails to register. This may be a weakness of the collaboration; \\"Hannah Alexander\\" is the pen name for Dr. Mel and Cheryl Hodde (Hod-dee), who have written several books together and plan more novels in this \\"Hideaway\\" series.<br />However, weaknesses are more than offset by the strengths in this book. Some of the events are tragic, including those affecting Allison, as her brother-in-law's suit against her turns ugly and Red's deep-vein thrombosis even uglier. And as things turn ugly in town, too, with repeated acts of vandalism being blamed on Blaze, the doctor slowly, slowly, slowly begins to wonder if there might be more to the quiet, strong Christian faith of her new friends than she could have ever imagined.<br />Allison's road to spiritual recovery is rendered without dramatics, as befits her training and beliefs. Other characters are also attractive --- Dane Gideon, quirks and flaws included, is a fitting foil for the doctor, a female protagonist who does not conform to any particular doctrine's idea of womanhood but is nevertheless deeply attractive. However, when I finished, the character of Blaze was the one who stayed with me. An author (or authors!) who can create an African-American boy with emotional issues, whose skill with animals can bring tears to the eye, is (are) talented indeed. And so my confession ends with a penance and redemption that are one and the same: I look forward to the next Hannah Alexander suspense title!<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-01-24

People who read books about reading share an obsession so compelling that they can't help but judge another person's \\"favorite books\\" list against their own. Or in this case, \\"faith-shaping books,\\" which I assume also qualifies them for favorite status. In any event, INDELIBLE INK provides enough fodder to keep compulsive readers engaged in arguments in their heads for some time to come.    The 22 featured essayists range from the venerable J.I. Packer (whose name appears as an author of influence in more than one essay) to relative newcomer Liz Curtis Higgs. Supplementing the main essays is an appendix listing the two or three favorite books of some 130 other Christian leaders.    Both sections are filled with surprises, not the least of which is essayist Gary R. Collins's choice of a book about a caterpillar named Stripe titled HOPE FOR THE FLOWERS by Trina Paulus. (I can relate; a children's book titled LITTLE THINGS by Anne Laurin describes my marriage better than any psychologist ever could.) Another surprise is the frequency with which the names of novelists, poets and dramatists appear. The likes of Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Dumas, Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Dante and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (whose GULAG ARCHIPELAGO and ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH, I'm convinced, paved the way for my own conversion to Christ in the 1970s) share ink with some of the greatest theologians ever --- St. Augustine, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Søren Kierkegaard and others.    My favorite essay is \\"My Three Best Friends ... Maybe\\" by Calvin Miller --- a fellow \\"narcolibric,\\" a term Miller coined to describe the \\"print-addicted\\" among us. Except for his fondness for Emily Dickinson, whose poems I once deemed worthy of Good Housekeeping (seriously offending my high school literature teacher), Miller's essay, especially his observations on what I call bookaholism, mirrors my own approach to reading and integrating into my life the things I've read.    In the appendix, ElisabethElliot cited Amy Carmichael as her single choice --- which seems unusual, except that Carmichael wrote 40-plus books. Who knew? I doubt that even those Christians who are familiar with her and her work are aware that she was such a prolific writer. Another surprise: Fernando Ortega's choice of THE HABIT OF BEING: Letters of Flannery O'Connor. O'Connor as an author is not such a curious choice --- it's the collection of her letters that is surprising. His description forced me to add yet another title to my ever-growing list of must-reads. (An aside: A current bestselling book on heaven suggests that we'll be able to customize our afterlife experience. If so, I'm putting in a bid for a library of all the books I wanted to read before my untimely demise. I'm guessing it won't include a copy of Hubert P. Yockey's INFORMATION THEORY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, one of Hugh Ross's favorites.)    About three chapters into the book, I decided it would be a great idea to start keeping track of the authors to see how many times my favorites showed up in the results. I came to my senses soon enough and settled on a less formal method of accounting, something between a guess and a hunch. By the end of the book, I had decided that the front-running authors were C.S. Lewis, which was pretty much a no-brainer, and, much to my surprise and delight, Dostoyevsky. That's when I found the link to the INDELIBLE INK web site, [...] and the page of \\"Top Tens\\": authors, titles, authors with the most titles, and contemporary authors.    My beloved Mr. Lewis topped three of the lists: number one book, with 20 mentions for MERE CHRISTIANITY; number one author, with 39 mentions; and author with the most titles, 12. What was even more telling were the runners-up in those categories. Second-place book was Oswald Chambers's MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST, cited 12 times; second place in the author category was a three-way tie between Dostoyevsky (yes!), Packer and Chambers, with 12 mentions each; and runner-up for author with the most titles was Francis Schaeffer with seven titles mentioned. Lewis's substantial lead over the runners-up lent further support to my oft-vocalized opinion that Lewis was far and away the best Christian writer of the 20th century.    What all of this has done for me, and likely will do for other hopelessly narcolibric readers, is add yet more names and titles to an ever-expanding \\"To Read\\" list. But I'm fine with that; the high quality of INDELIBLE INK's essays assures me that the books I've added to my list are well worth reading.	2004-01-24

Maxwell has made a name for himself as an authority on leadership, landing on bestseller lists in both the Christian and general markets. That's quite an accomplishment, and it's one he has legitimately earned. In addition to writing more than two-dozen books, he has established several organizations geared toward training and equipping leaders and has developed numerous ancillary products like tape series, handbooks and manuals, and curriculum materials. In short, he's an expert in his field and one of the best communicators out there.    That said, you should know that Maxwell mines the wealth of information and resources he has amassed and recycles it all to create new books --- which means that one Maxwell book often overlaps into another one, which overlaps into another one, and so on. Longtime readers of Maxwell are well aware of this, having discovered a significant amount of familiar material in the context of information that's genuinely new. He's often criticized for this, but he still manages to sell a whole lot of books, so I suspect it isn't as much of a problem as his critics would like to believe.    In DEVELOPING THE LEADERS AROUND YOU, Maxwell provides both inspirational and practical assistance for leaders who are committed to helping others reach their leadership potential. In trademark Maxwell style, the author gets his point across by making the most of reader-friendly features like assessment tests, charts, cartoons, sports analogies, and mnemonic devices like original acronyms (such as RISE, Rewards Indicating Staff Expectations). He also sprinkles the text with well-chosen quotations --- some profound, some funny, but all of them relevant to the topic at hand.    One of the things I like most about this book is its helpfulness to people outside of the business community. It's especially appropriate for CEOs and other leaders like pastors, but many of the principles and practical tips can be applied to people in all walks of life who supervise (or even parent) others. That's because at the heart of each principle is the priority Maxwell places on building strong relationships and learning to relate to people in a healthy and positive way. Another strength is that it is a stand-alone volume; there's no need to be familiar with any of Maxwell's previous works to benefit from this one.    Here's an example of what you can expect to find, from a chapter on a lifelong commitment to developing potential leaders. In addition to straight text, Maxwell offers a chart defining the distinctions among nurturing, equipping and developing others; three specific questions designed to determine the potential leader's motivation; an example of a practical plan for personal growth; a description of the four steps it takes for someone to adopt a new idea and adapt to new situations; several mnemonic devices, including the IDEA grid (Instruction, Demonstration, Exposure, Accountability); 10 guidelines for positive confrontation; and an analysis of the six levels of leadership growth. Clearly, this is an author who covers all the bases.    Anyone who has read Maxwell or sat through one of his many speaking engagements knows that he has a reputation for excelling in communicating his ideas. (I've actually attended several after-lunch Maxwell sessions, and I did not fall asleep. This is something of a record and high praise indeed.) With DEVELOPING THE LEADERS AROUND YOU, that reputation remains intact. His casual, anecdotal style makes this an enjoyable read --- not bad for a topic that could easily produce the opposite result.	2004-01-24

That's the thought that would run through my mind whenever some publishing industry colleague suggested that the quality of evangelical fiction would eventually rival that of mainstream novels. Deeming these hopelessly optimistic professionals as downright delusional, I continued to bypass the Christian fiction titles in my bookstores of choice.    Then something curious began to happen. Friends whose literary opinions I trusted began dropping the names of Christian novels that they considered good --- not just better than the usual fare, but genuinely good. Within the past year or so, I actually heard that praise applied to no less than a half-dozen titles. But when one friend described Ted Dekker's suspense novel THR3E as \\"flawless,\\" I knew I had to read it, if only to prove her wrong.    By page 20 or so --- usually the point at which I relegate Christian novels to the \\"donate\\" pile --- I was completely hooked, no-turning back. At that point in the book, you know that mild-mannered seminarian Kevin Parson has done somebody wrong, given the car bomb and all. What you don't know yet is that the author is about to take you on an exhilarating ride filled with so many hairpin twists and turns that you'll quickly forget you have this other life requiring nuisance activities like eating and sleeping.    On the two or three occasions when something equaling a life-or-death emergency forced me to stop reading, I'd put the book aside and silently pray something ludicrous like \\"Please, God, please please please don't let this book be a disappointment.\\" Foolish, adolescent, unsophisticated behavior, I know. But you know what? He must have heard me and at some point said, \\"OK,\\" because THR3E never let me down.    The gist of the story is this, sort of: After getting the first call from a stranger warning him of the car bomb, Parson continues to hear from the mystery caller. Each time, the caller --- known as Slater --- threatens to cause greater destruction involving the loss of more and more lives unless Parson meets his single demand: that he confess his sin. Not his sins, but some great nameless sin that Parson has committed in the past. The bombings bring in the FBI and the California Bureau of Inspection and keep Parson on the move as he tries to make sense of Slater's maddening clues and thus avert catastrophe. That's \\"sort of\\" the gist, because things are seldom what they seem to be in this version of reality.    To go into much more detail would be difficult without venturing into the realm of spoiler. Believe me, this is one story you don't want anyone to spoil for you. I've read a fair number of suspense novels --- for whatever reason, it seems I couldn't get through a pregnancy without Robert Ludlum on my nightstand --- and each time I've held out hope that I'd experience the heady rush that comes with a true stunner, a surprise ending that I never could have anticipated. THR3E's rush brought to mind the phrase \\"shock and awe\\" --- only in this case, it seemed more accurate.    This is the point where I would normally say something negative, like \\"Yes, it's a great book, but...\\" and then drop some mild criticism on it. Few people trust the opinions of a gushing reviewer, so I'll try to maintain my credibility by issuing the only negative comment I can make about THR3E: It deprived me of the satisfaction of proving my friend wrong. Because, as I discovered, THR3E really is a flawless book.	2004-01-24

This book will help you seek answers	What do you love enough to die for?<br />That's the question professor and philosopher Ramesh Richard asks in his latest book, SOUL PASSION. The first installment in The Intentional Life Trilogy, SOUL PASSION encourages the Christian reader to restructure his or her personal existence from aimless, random living to what Richard calls &quot;intentional&quot; living. The author envisions Christians who eschew mediocre, unexamined lives and consciously seek to do God's will. And the first step is identifying one's passion.<br />&quot;Passion and intentionality are verbal and existential synonyms. Nobody follows passion unintentionally, or it wouldn't be passion. The first constituent of the intentional life, of the supreme purpose, is passion, for one chooses the ultimate object of his love. People choose what they are willing to live and die for, suffer and sacrifice for ... True passion considers the cost but still pursues the object passionately. That kind of passion launches intentional living with core love permeating every part of life. Your passion gives you convictions about what is ultra-important to you, the criteria by which all of life is driven, gains energy, and continues.&quot;<br />This passion is the foundation of the metaphorical building that is an intentional life and Richard goes on to describe its components, encourage its wise development, and offer reminders to nurture it. As in Scripture, Richard emphasizes that it is Christ who should be our foundation --- our true passion.<br />The author's insights are at their most keen when they expose our tendency to mistake activity for purpose, motion for intentionality. His lengthy introduction systematically attempts to create purpose apart from Christ, and he spends a great deal of time describing what an intentional life is not before delving into what an intentional life is.<br />&quot;Systematic&quot; is an apt description of SOUL PASSION. While Richard offers many illustrations of his ideas, thebook's outline is in clear view and can at times feel like a primer for a fill-in-the-blank exam. The author, an internationally known professor and doctor of philosophy, has obviously tried to write in an accessible manner, but there are inadvertent flexes of his academic muscle reflected in his systematic format and some vocabulary (nomenclature, ontological, etc.). The tradeoff is a more comprehensive look at the philosophical and biblical understanding of different approaches to life than most books in the genre offer.<br />These characteristics of the book may be strengths or weaknesses depending on the proclivities of the individual reader, but they do little to obscure what is a fundamentally sound approach to building a personal foundation for the Christian life. The final two books in The Intentional Life Trilogy, SOUL MISSION (due out in February) and SOUL VISION, promise to continue Richard's &quot;life as a building&quot; metaphor and provide guidance for developing a thriving ground floor (mission) and defining the superstructure (vision).<br />So, what is your passion? What do you love enough to die for? These are questions worth answering, and Richard has authored a tool to help fill in the blanks.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-01-24

I'm not married and I'm not a mother. Go figure. But since I moved in with my parents and two younger brothers a few months ago (got laid off, minimizing expenses while looking for a job, you know the drill), my healthy, if distant, appreciation for home engineers has developed into downright deification. As an adult member of the household, I'm frequently overwhelmed by how much needs to be done on a daily basis.<br />Perhaps that's why TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM strikes me as one of the best books I've read in a long time. Written by home schooling mom and entrepreneur Shelia Wray Gregoire, the book is chock full of practical tips for doing everything around the home from cleaning to keeping spending in check to stoking the romantic fires. A lot of her suggestions aren't necessarily rocket science, but she presents them in a fresh way and gives the business of running a family a new spin.<br />One feature of the book that I found especially insightful is a section profiling one day in the life of three women living at three different points in American history. These short fictional accounts reveal that while women over the years share many of the same concerns about the welfare of their families, the tangible nuts and bolts of running a household have evolved significantly. This will be an epiphany for the many modern women harboring guilt-inducing notions that the housewives of earlier generations were better at running their households despite the absence of the time and effort saving conveniences that clutter homes today. On the contrary, Gregoire convincingly points out that these technological advances have actually added more lines on today's to-do lists.<br />And while all of this is helpful, the real value of Gregorie's book is in its discussion of the principles that should guide the division of labor in the home. <br />As the back cover says, this is no &quot;women's lib&quot; book and Gregorie does not fail to mention biblical verses referring to wives submitting to husbands. Nevertheless, she does a masterful job of exposing how commonly held ideas about gender roles within the home are of a cultural construction and not a biblical construction. Furthermore, she points out that these traditional gender roles aren't effective for many families existing in our modern economy. With this in mind, she suggests innovative ways to devise a truly harmonious living and working environment.<br />This harmonious environment is ultimately the goal of everything that TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM proposes.<br />&quot;As you change your emphasis to people's comfort, rather than keeping up appearances, your attitude toward housework will probably change as well. Having the 'perfect house' as a standard can be very debilitating, constricting our ability to share with others. Maybe you'd like to invite that new couple over after church, but you can't possibly let them in your home right now because there are still crumbs on the counter from breakfast and the kid's toys are lying on the stairs. <br />When we think this way, we are putting things ahead of people. Creating a family friendly home means creating a home where people feel comfortable. Pastor Kevin Dowling, a friend from our hometown says that Christians should aim to be hospitable, not to entertain. Our aim is to share our homes and our lives, not to put on a show. So instead of putting your energy into keeping a perfect home that few see, try creating a comfortable one the people feel welcome in.&quot;<br />And, as a result, TO LOVE, HONOR, AND VACUUM offers encouragement for the overwhelmed, freedom from perfectionism, and a vision of life dominated by care, not precision.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-01-24

While it's a return of sorts to the territory that he covered in SEX BEGINS IN THE KITCHEN, Leman uncovers much more ground in this revealing look at the secrets to connubial bliss.<br />\\"It's not just a how-to-do-it manual,\\" writes Leman. \\"This is more of a do-it-yourself look at why to do it and how to do it better.\\" With his trademark wit and wisdom, Leman offers couples no-nonsense guidance for creating and keeping a satisfying sexual relationship.<br />The provocative primer includes 31 ideas for sensual surprises, including a racy recipe for creating a chocolate bath complete with whipped cream. Also included for readers are helpful suggestions for identifying and satisfying not only the needs but also the desires of their spouses.<br />\\"One of the most loving and holy things you can do in marriage is to provide a sexually fulfilling pursuit of your husband or wife,\\" Leman writes. \\"Therefore without apology, this is the most explicit book I've ever written. Probably everybody will be offended by at least one thing I say in this book.\\"<br />Leman confesses that the book was the hardest to write of the 25 titles he's written to date and even goes so far as to include a brief note to readers, admitting that part of what is included in the book may be too forward for some. For readers in premarital counseling specifically, he suggests saving the second half of the book for the honeymoon.<br />In the chapter titled \\"A Very Special Connection,\\" Leman addresses several of the more common sexual positions and even some of the not-so-common ones. Later in the book, he is supportive of oral sex, devoting an entire chapter to \\"Oral Delights.\\"<br />Throughout the book, Leman stresses the need to consider the appetites of one's spouse and suggests never coercing them into any type of sex act unwillingly. The law of loveis to rule in the bedroom as much as any place else, he maintains.<br />Arguably somewhat graphic in places for a Christian sex guide, the book nevertheless excels at confronting unhealthy sexual inhibitions in the name of liberating couples' God-given passions for their own good.<br />While not for the faint of heart, SHEET MUSIC is a much-needed resource for recovering sexual intimacy in marriage. Leman has composed a stirring classic, moving readers to create beautiful music together. Encore!<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-01-24

Sometimes that delight is found in a short novel that one can read in one or two evenings, from first-page storm to last-page resolution.<br />For Advent inspiration or a Christmas gift, Vinita Hampton Wright's new seasonal novella fills the bill. After the opening Colorado blizzard that maroons \\"postcollege, prejob\\" Jana, the book's wintry scene has less to do with cold weather --- most of the December action taking place in balmy Atlanta --- than with the chill in Jana's heart.<br />Jana's faithless life is fragmented: her parents divorced, her boyfriend out of the picture. \\"She had just survived Thanksgiving with Dad and his wife,\\" whom he had met \\"at some conference about reclaiming life's positive energy.\\" Until Jana slid off the road and into a ditch, \\"she had been gratefully alone and headed across the country, toward Christmas\\" in Georgia with her mother, currently undergoing distressing cancer treatments in the care of Jana's aunt.<br />Jana \\"wasn't especially looking forward to Christmas either.\\" But \\"when both parents had left you, you'd broken up with your boyfriend, and you had no job or money, well of course the thing to do was go have a Happy Thanksgiving and then top that off with a Merry Christmas.\\" Such were the expectations she placed on herself and anticipated from others, notably her aunt Cheryl, who, in Jana's view had two strikes against her: Cheryl insisted on calling Jana by her full name, Mary Georgianna; Cheryl was also \\"very tight with 'the Lord.'\\" Jana mentally summarized her cross-country trip: \\"I'm making a pilgrimage from New Age freaks to Holy Rollers.\\" Even her unchurched mother was talking about God since she'd taken sick.<br />In the second of the novella's three parts (\\"The Journey, \\"The Encounter,\\" and \\"The Gift\\") Jana reluctantly attends Cheryl's \\"rather well-to-do\\" Southern Baptist church, where \\"people were way too friendly, considering they hardly knew her.\\" But there she meets a middle-aged woman named Sandra, whom Jana recognizes as someone \\"she might actually like to talk to.\\"<br />A spiritual director trained to listen well, Sandra befriends Jana and gently challenges her to read Luke's account of the Christmas story, imagine herself as a character and journal her experience. \\"Enter the story and walk beside Mary, and talk to her. Ask her any questions you like...God meets you in that story and tells you what you need to understand.\\"<br />In this fashion Jana --- whose real name, you remember, is Mary --- encounters Mary, Joseph, the shepherds and the Christchild. Over several days she reads, up through the account of Simeon and Anna, who intuitively know the baby's identity. Jana journals conversations with young Mary, musings about old Anna and herself: \\"Would I ever recognize the Jesus child? Would I know what to look for? Would I care enough to notice?\\"<br />In the company of Luke's characters, Jana's maternal family and their Southern Baptist friends, Jana receives a gift that sets her on a new journey. As Jana hears at Christmas dinner, \\"This is what faith gives us, celebrations of what has already come true and celebrations of what will someday be true.\\"<br />Wright dedicates her book to \\"every young woman who needs company on the journey.\\" THE WINTER SEEKING is very appropriate for young women who are struggling to find their place in and way through life. But it is more than a young adult novel; it is a refreshing, well-written story that shines hope, like warm light, into any winter season.<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-01-24

The book's small page count makes it rather spare compared to the earlier ones, but as a seasonal title and as an art book it largely succeeds.<br />Highlighting personal reminiscences of Christmastime traditions the couple has observed during their more than 20 years of marriage, the book offers readers a holiday glimpse into the hearth-and-home philosophy Thomas espouses through his artwork. With alternating reflections from Thomas and Nanette, readers are welcome to savor the sense of visiting with the Kinkades over a cup of Christmas tea.<br />&quot;There is just a little bit of Christmas in every one of my paintings,&quot; writes the celebrated artist. Thomas shares what he means by describing how he signs all of his artwork not only with his name but also with the Christian symbol of a fish and the scripture reference of John 3:16, reminding everyone of the Christ of Christmas.<br />In the chapter titled &quot;Happy Birthday, Jesus,&quot; Nanette shares the Kinkade family tradition of making a birthday cake on Christmas Eve, putting candles on it and singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Jesus before blowing out the candles. As for Santa Claus, he's the equivalent of the birthday clown who helps with the party, she explains.<br />While the Kinkade's way of celebrating the holidays admittedly may not be everyone's cup of tea, THE MANY LOVES OF CHRISTMAS is likely to resonate with longtime Kinkade fans as well as countless others trying to tune out the call of the mall in favor of tuning in to the reason for the season.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-01-24

Well known for his bestselling series of titles based on \\"The Five Love Languages,\\" he strives in his latest work to move couples from a contract mentality toward covenant matrimony.<br />Decrying the growing divorce rate among Christians, Chapman calls readers to a closer commitment to the cause of Christ. In his estimation there isn't the social stigma attached to divorce that there once was, and this is largely a result of divorce becoming culturally acceptable in the church.<br />Chapman suggests that communication and intimacy are essential to maintaining the sacredness of the marriage relationship, and he outlines the means to achieving them with skill and sensitivity. Identifying the types of unhealthy communication patterns and the five levels of communication, he offers readers useful material in a meaningful manner.<br />As Chapman cleverly points out, \\"The word communication is found in the dictionary between the words commotion and community.\\" Building on that thought, he suggests to couples that community is the result of good communication while commotion is created by poor communication.<br />He also addresses the need for a definition of love that is scriptural rather than secular, maintaining that too many couples today focus more on being happy than being holy. Chapman explains that the secular meaning of love is a feeling, while the scriptural meaning is a commitment.<br />According to Chapman, the mistake that many people make is that they place an emphasis on the fleeting emotion of happiness, which is dependent on what is happening temporarily instead of on the eternal value of holiness, which is reflective of a life wholly submitted to the Lord. After all, he states, the purpose of life is to do the will of God, not our own.<br />Paradoxically, Chapman reminds readers that life is more than having a good marriage. \\"The Christian's ultimate call is not the call to develop a good marriage; the Christian's call is to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. As Christians, we must remember that marriage is not an end in itself,\\" he writes.<br />One particularly helpful resource is a chart with the heading, \\"Personality Opposites,\\" which treats readers to an instructive listing of a dozen stereotypical personality types and their polar opposites, offering an insightful lesson on how opposites attract.<br />Toward the close of the book, Chapman devotes several chapters to specific types of intimacy, including emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, sexual intimacy and spiritual intimacy, complete with helpful suggestions for achieving each type.<br />A welcome addition to the growing collection of marriage enrichment guides, COVENANT MARRIAGE is a must-read for anyone who desires a marriage modeled on covenant commitment rather than contract convenience.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-01-24

What ensues is a story of intrigue and misunderstandings, and all manner of entomological mayhem. And thankfully, only the merest hint of romantic attraction. Anything more would have been way too predictable, and one of Downs's many strengths as a writer is his unpredictability.    From the opening scene you have this suspicion that SHOOFLY PIE is not going to be your typical Christian novel, although things have improved so dramatically in so short a time on the CBA fiction front that I'm not sure how much longer I can keep comparing new releases to what used to be typical. Downs's opener is as memorable a scene as you'll find anywhere in contemporary fiction, and what's even better, the rest of the book is worthy of his captivating prologue. It's funny, smart, suspenseful, and blessedly free of heavy-handed reminders that this is a \\"Christian\\" novel.    And it has characters, starting with Polchak. How Downs managed to create such a distinctive, provocative and believably eccentric character in his first novel is the kind of thing that should be required instruction at writers' conferences. Downs should also teach a course or ten on writing dialogue --- he has that pretty much perfected.    The guy --- Polchak, that is --- just won't let go once he settles into your imagination. He's self-absorbed and irritating and likeable in that exasperating way that annoying but charming people seem to somehow master. His thinking is so intertwined with his work that he describes people and their habits in entomological terms, and he does it so unselfconsciously that it's simply hilarious.    Which brings up another point: Never does Downs's writing seem forced. All the elements that make for good fiction --- among them, memorable characters, a colorful setting, a riveting plot and believable dialogue --- come together seamlessly in this book. There's a flow to the story that makes for a genuinely enjoyable reading experience.    About the Jeff Goldblum/Indiana Jones connection: Polchak's wisecracks, comebacks and observations about the human condition could have come straight from the mouth of Jones, which is not so surprising considering that, like Jones, he's an academic who gets caught up in an adventure of sorts. Physically, he's Jeff Goldblum. And if that leaves you with the impression that reading SHOOFLY PIE tends to conjure up cinematic images, well, you'd be right. And that's because this is one book that would make a terrific movie.    And yes, this is the first novel in the Bug Man series. There's more to come, and that is very, very good news.	2004-01-24

Whatever words or actions preceded the question must finally give way to its answer --- yes or no --- and lives converge or divide forever.<br />Of course the converging and the dividing are never as simple as one would hope --- especially when the &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is less a decision and more a way to avoid a decision. Such is the case in IF I GAINED THE WORLD when Daniel Monroe's girlfriend of six years and mother of his son &quot;pops&quot; the question. He doesn't have to say &quot;no&quot; after several days of not saying &quot;yes.&quot; And so their lives begin to divide.<br />In Lenore Vine, the jilted lover, author Linda Nichols has created a complex character with whom it is easy to identify. The fact that she is &quot;plain&quot; and Daniel has the looks of a movie star (literally, he becomes a movie star) could oh-so-easily make the story painfully contrived. Instead, Lenore is a bundle of strengths and weaknesses that make her uniquely tragic and heroic at the same time.<br />Lenore's insecurities are palpable, but you know she loves her life with Daniel. It's when she is swept up in a vision of growing old with this man, doing it on purpose as husband and wife rather than by default as lovers, that she asks the question that grinds her happiness to dust. And the bond that was growing between the reader and Lenore is sealed in by this pain and the ache that would follow:<br />&quot;Lenore held her pale hand in front of her, rotated her wrist, looked at the pink palm with its faint lines, then turned it. It looked familiar but seemed as though it belonged to someone else. She looked down at her denim legs and felt the same way. Disconnected. They were someone else's legs.<br />There. She felt better. If it wasn't her body, then she could be here for a while. If it wasn't her life, she could stand it. She wasjust taking care of it for a bit, making a few decisions until the owner could come back. She heard herself give a little laugh and wondered if she was going insane.<br />She couldn't go insane. She didn't even have a telephone number for Daniel, and there was no one to take care of Scott if he went insane right now. She could go insane later. Maybe tomorrow.&quot;<br />The narrative splits between Seattle, where Lenore and Scott make a new home, and L.A., where Daniel becomes a successful actor. For 15 years the story follows the lives of the former lovers forever hinged by their son and their six years together. Their two worlds become a study in contrast. Even in the midst of their sometimes hardscrabble existence, Lenore and Scott's lives eventually fill up with people, and hope and faith. They build a new family --- a motley crew that includes a former drunk, a Southern Baptist grandma, and a brat of a little girl --- that sustains them through sickness, anger and rebellion.<br />Meanwhile, Daniel's career hits the big time. But ensconced in luxury and surrounded by &quot;the beautiful people,&quot; Daniel becomes increasingly isolated. Nichols does an excellent job of portraying how a person can deceive himself about what it is that he really wants and needs, and Daniel slips further and further into a malaise lubricated by alcohol and women.<br />I do think that IF I GAINED THE WORLD would be a better book if it were about two-thirds its current size. There is a lot of loose writing and internal dialogue that seems superfluous, especially in contrast with some underdeveloped supporting characters. Nevertheless, this story about the redemptive power of grace pulls the reader into a web of relationships and regret from which it's impossible to extricate oneself without gaining insight and a bit of hope.<br />   --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel	2004-01-24

The resulting sales were amazing --- but nowhere near as amazing as the realization that women (Christian women, no less!) needed a similar book to help them come to terms with their unique struggles with sexual temptation. The notion that Christian women face strong physical and emotional temptation has long been dismissed or ignored. After all, \\"good\\" women simply don't have those kinds of battles, right? That kind of thinking has prevented Christian women from sharing their struggles with even their closest friends.    In the foreword, Stephen Arterburn makes a point that is crucial to understanding why women face temptation and how they become so vulnerable to unhealthy attractions to, and relationships with, men. What it comes down to, Arterburn writes, is disappointment. For married women --- the target audience for this book --- that means disappointment with their husbands, a problem exacerbated by comparisons with men who appear to be more considerate, affectionate, sensitive, intelligent and good-looking. For single women, temptation is often closely linked to the idea of lack --- lack of love, of marriage, of the opportunity for \\"licit\\" sex --- and the uncertainty of ever finding fulfillment.    In her opener, Ethridge confesses to having extramarital affairs with five men simultaneously. None involved sexual contact, but each compromised her relationship with her husband as she alternately obsessed and fantasized over each of the five men. Those mental and emotional attachments prevented her from experiencing true intimacy with her husband and fulfillment in her marriage and her life --- not to mention her relationship with God. Today she ministers to other women who struggle with affairs, both real and imagined, and helps them establish relationship boundaries, lifestyle changes, uncompromising moral standards, and methods for reading the warning signs that a line is about to be crossed.    And Ethridge handles all of this with a refreshing frankness about her own struggles, some of which continued even after she believed she had set the proper limitations on her own relationships with men. No one reading this book can very well argue, \\"Well, she just doesn't understand,\\" because it's clear that she does. She's been there, and she has found the courage not only to come clean with her husband and thereby strengthen her marriage but also to expose her weaknesses publicly and thereby make herself accessible to women who so desperately need the help she offers.    Best of all, the help she offers is highly practical. Throughout the book, she gives specific guidelines for women to follow and even specific kinds of responses to flattering comments and overt come-ons from men. Instead of listing a host of rules, Ethridge lays out a number of biblical principles that women can use to guide them into making appropriate decisions. She urges women to guard against such potentially damaging activities as comparing a spouse with other men, watching questionable TV shows and movies, fantasizing about other men, engaging in self-gratification, and indulging in \\"harmless\\" flirtation. But she's never heavy-handed; her way is a way of grace and compassion.    It will be interesting to see how sales of this book stack up against the men's book. Are \\"good Christian women\\" ready to admit their weakness and buy a book like this? Let's hope so. Ethridge has opened up her life so that others may discover the healing and wholeness and true intimacy they're seeking. I suspect many women have a chance of finding just that in this book.	2004-01-24

With the upcoming release of the third Harry Potter movie to the much-anticipated release of the final movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, we have been inundated with these two characters. Both overcoming evil for the triumph of good, it's easy to understand the attraction to both. But how are we to discern whether these characters, books and movies are moral and present a worldview that is proper for our children?<br />FRODO &amp; HARRY, co-authored by media experts Ted Baehr and Tom Snyder, compares the fantasy worlds of Frodo and Harry Potter, contrasting the fictional &quot;real world&quot; in The Lord of the Rings with the occult world of Harry Potter. Baehr and Snyder are obviously movie buffs, but they are also Christians who observe culture and are concerned with the way visual media is affecting our world. &quot;Our purpose is to help people of faith and values see and understand the difference between the two movies that have been adapted from the popular literary works,&quot; the authors state.<br />Part one is an analysis comparing and contrasting both movies and their worldviews. They briefly outline each film and discuss the message that each is giving. Although they point out a couple of positive aspects, the authors are extremely critical of Harry Potter, saying that it &quot;attacks Biblical Christianity,&quot; and that the stories reflect a &quot;pagan, gnostic, and nominalistic worldview.&quot; However, they praise The Lord of the Rings, calling it an &quot;epic story&quot; that &quot;points us toward God and Jesus Christ and toward truth, honor, virtue, and beauty.&quot; Discussion questions at the end of each beginning chapter help readers evaluate the books and movies, and their effect on their lives personally.<br />The second part of the book touches on the spiritual approach we are to take when evaluating entertainment media in order to protect our lives from negativeinfluences. Because the entertainment industry has such an influence over our children, Baehr and Snyder say parents should be concerned. They provide shocking statistics, ways we can pass on our moral and spiritual values to our children and go into detail about how children develop mentally and exactly how they react to certain types of media --- horror films, violence, etc. This section also touches on the history of the Church and its relationship with media and culture. Finally, there are suggestions for discerning readers and parents on how to ask the right questions about Frodo and Harry.<br />FRODO &amp; HARRY is strongly recommended for those who are interested in pop-culture and how it relates to our spiritual lives, as well as for thoughtful parents who want to learn about the nature of the fantasy genre and the various critical tools necessary to develop an informed judgment about art and entertainment.<br />   --- Reviewed by Karen Campbell	2004-01-24

This means I had no idea that James Calvin Schaap's new novel was set in 1890, in western South Dakota. Until I saw the cover, a tinted photo of Sioux hunters, I did not imagine that the title, TOUCHES THE SKY, might be someone's name. Had I known that this was a &quot;western,&quot; probing the tension between settlers and the Sioux, I probably would have passed it over. Another genre please.<br />What a mistake that would have been. This a good, multi-layered novel written in the first-person voice of Jan Ellerbroek, who had impulsively left his Dutch community in Michigan and moved west, embittered after the sudden deaths of his young wife and baby. When the book opens, he has unexpectedly and happily married again, to Dalitha, a long-tenured and well-respected teacher on the Rosebud Reservation.<br />So narrator Jan, a liveryman who claims no Christian faith, has entrée to two cultures, each distrustful and afraid of the other. East of the reservation, a Dutch farmhand has been killed. His boss, known as a taskmaster, blames Sioux horse thieves. Jan isn't convinced. The ground is laid for a who-done-it, but that question is thrown aside when Jan is beckoned and confidentially asked to deliver a bag of coins to the reservation in order to satisfy the dying man's last-breath request: that his final wages be sent to an unnamed squaw who was carrying his child.<br />Hearing of Jan's task and acting on not much more than a hunch, Dalitha leads Jan on an extended search for her former student and aide, Anna Crow, who has quickly married and gone farther west to join forces with a new messiah-cult known as the ghost dancers. &quot;Like their stomachs,&quot; Jan notes, &quot;their hearts are hungry.&quot;<br />The Sioux have learned enough of Jesus to understand his love and his story's hope. Anna's father,Broken Antler, says to Dalitha, &quot;It is a story for our people and yours, you told me....I believed you....And now my daughter says this Jesus has come again, to us, because we are poor and suffering and because [the white people] put him on a cross to die. 'He is here,' she tells me, 'and now he loves us.' &quot; He is miraculously going to bring back the buffalo herds and destroy all the interloping whites. &quot;Why should I believe you and not my own daughter?&quot;<br />Schaap writes a taut story from the start, hinting at disaster. If I had been a better student of American history, I would have known that the plot was careening toward the massacre at Wounded Knee in December 1890. But that historical storyline is of course overlain with Jan's personal story. He and Dalitha aren't the only people looking for Anna and her child. An unexpected visit with his always-distant clergyman father confronts Jan with the rigid Calvinism in which he was raised. The God he has tried to run away from pursues him, through and beyond tragedy.<br />This is a serious novel --- not for people looking for easy answers or a light read. It raises issues still relevant today: Who speaks for God? Can we trust personal revelation? Do any of us know truth fully? How vast is God's grace? How does fear of &quot;them&quot; motivate or control &quot;us&quot;?<br />But this is not a difficult or dark novel. The narrator's voice is well controlled, from the beginning planting clues of trouble and seeds of hope. After all, the title is TOUCHES THE SKY.<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-01-24

(Sisterchicks Series #1)	Books	4	18	19	N	N	A Refreshing Antidote to Many &quot;Chick Lit&quot; Books	I'll confess: I adore so-called &quot;Chick Lit&quot; in all of its many guises, whether that means a Bridget Jones &quot;singleton&quot; heroine or a Jennifer Crusie-type middle-aged woman striking out on her own for the first time. However, all too many of the &quot;Chick Lit&quot; characters and plots involve myriad kinds of substance abuse (from caffeine to codeine and beyond) and self-loathing (cottage-cheese thighs, wardrobes lacking glamour, nasty boyfriends). So I found Robin Jones Gunn's new novel SISTERCHICKS ON THE LOOSE! a refreshing antidote to these other books, and believe that women of various spiritual paths will relish this different take on female lives and friendships.<br />Meet Sharon, a Washington State Christian wife and mother whose best friend Penny roared into town on the back of her husband Dave's Harley. After nearly a decade of living next door to each other, Sharon and Penny are separated when Dave takes a job in San Francisco. When Penny calls and reminds Sharon of their long-ago church-nursery vow to take off on an adventure together, Sharon is loath to leave her family --- even when Penny explains that she's paying for the jaunt to Finland to meet her dead mother's only sister. Unlike other Chick Lit heroines, however, Sharon has a steadfast and warm husband supporting her. When Jeff tells her he can handle hearth, home and three of four children (eldest son Tyler is away at college), Sharon faces her fears of flying and takes off with Penny for Helsinki.<br />Of course, no plot would be complete without tension, and since Jones Gunn has given Sharon a good man, she cannily provides a bad mother-in-law to ratchet things up a bit. Gloria, given to calling her daughter-in-law &quot;Sharondear&quot; and Penny &quot;Daveswife,&quot; is not a one-dimensional caricature, but a deeply unhappy person whose constant woe threatens to unseat Sharon's calm demeanor. Knowing that Gloria is back in Chinook Springs spreading her own little garden of bitterness makes Sharon uncomfortable, and the various travel mishaps that occur during the first leg of the friends' trip make her even more so (many readers will relate to the lost luggage, airline crowding, and hotel miscommunications that follow).<br />Some of the scene setting seems tedious, but Gunn's portrait of two women smack in the middle of life rings true, especially when Sharon and Penny are annoyed with each other. The author's definition of a &quot;sisterchick&quot; is &quot;Someone who knows the deepest wonders of your heart, loves you like a sister, and provides a reality check when you're being a brat.&quot; What's not here is all the binging and whining that mark all-too-trendy British Chick Lit titles, although they do indulge happily in chocolate. When Sharon and Penny come unglued, they don't let their relationship unravel --- they keep communicating, moving and praying. For small-town Sharon, the biggest joy and wonder of their trip may be realizing that other women of different cultures, ages and stages can be sisterchicks, too.<br />Meanwhile, the discoveries and experiences along the road from Washington State to Helsinki to London and Liverpool help the &quot;sisterchicks&quot; deepen their bond and tackle some deep issues. The fact that Gunn's Epilogue shows that some of those issues took time to resolve made everything much more realistic, and sets the stage for her future books.

He's boyishly handsome, a loving husband and father of five, and someone who can write about his first book --- a huge bestseller --- like this, &quot;The material achievements of THE CHRISTMAS BOX never will convey its true success, the lives it has changed, the families brought closer together, the mothers and fathers who suddenly understand the pricelessness of their children's fleeting childhood.&quot; (And before you start thinking cynically, Evans used that book's mega-success to launch a foundation that subsidizes halfway homes for abused and neglected children.)<br />In his latest book, his eighth, Evans takes a different view of what it is like to be a successful, famous author. The protagonist of A PERFECT DAY, Robert Mason Harlan, has written a book of the same title based on a true, heartbreaking story from his wife's life. Harlan, once a successful radio advertising executive, had a series of bad breaks and spent eight years installing lawn sprinklers before his novel was published. His wife, daughter and agent stand behind him faithfully as his book becomes a sensation.<br />Success, however, finds Harlan making some bad choices. While his wife Allison had a loving family, Robert grew up the son of a rigid, frigid military officer. Between his unhappy childhood and career troubles, Robert has come to believe that he is entitled to more. First, it's a way too lengthy book tour; then a speaking event that Robert allows to take precedence over a family emergency; finally, he fires Camille, his caring and nurturing literary agent in order to sign with a big macher who promises movie deals and much more money. He flies home and whisks Allison off to a real estate appointment to see a six-bedroom mansion &quot;complete with home theater.&quot; When she balks at leaving their modest home, he leaves her --- and Carson, their six-year-old daughter.<br />Robert's new whirl of celebrity suits him, and he's settling in to rounds of talk shows and restaurant lunches when a mysterious and curious man insists on sharing his table at Starbucks. The stranger, who calls himself Michael, knows nearly everything about Robert's life that Robert himself does --- but also knows a couple of things Robert doesn't. Bowled over by the information Michael gives him, Robert sets out doing what he has become accustomed to doing with information: to use it to his advantage.<br />Robert has become very good at this, and before long he is back in Salt Lake City, wooing his wife and daughter with gifts of goods and time. Allison is properly suspicious, Carson is properly thrilled, and Robert believes he's doing just the right thing.<br />Except he's not.<br />Revealing any more would be unfair, though I will share that Evans throws an interesting curve ball towards the end that serves to remind readers (maybe the author, too) not to take anything too seriously. I will also share that, as usual, Evans's writing is deft.<br />Evans knows how effective it can be to tug at heartstrings, and he does this with a higher purpose in mind. The charities he has founded have benefitted from his fiction writing as people look for a way to make a difference after reading his books. He empowers his readers to take a fresh look at their lives. And that is the point he again makes in A PERFECT DAY.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-01-24

Written by Richard A. Swenson, M.D., a former practicing physician, the book is the result of more than a decade of professional research and personal experience.<br />Following several years as an associate professor at a state medical school, Swenson now writes and speaks full-time as an expert on the intersection of faith, health, culture and the future. And his insightful analysis here does not disappoint, as he succeeds brilliantly at bridging the gap between the sacred and the secular, the timeless and the temporal.<br />Defining margin as the space that exists between people and their personal limits, Swenson suggests it is has largely been squeezed out of our lives and become yet another casualty of the harried and hurried times in which we live. Yet margin must be restored if we are to experience health through contentment, simplicity, balance and rest, he says.<br />From the opening chapter titled &quot;Marginless Living,&quot; Swenson describes the decimation left in the wake of living with chronic overload. From our overstressed teachers and overworked farmers to overburdened pastors and overwhelmed parents, society at large has succumbed to the pressures of progress.<br />And, according to Swenson, the type of overload we are experiencing is a relatively new phenomenon, exponential in growth and unprecedented in scope. Fueled by the power of technology, living today has accelerated to warp speed, with many people yearning for a rest stop, if not an exit ramp, off the frenetic freeway of life.<br />&quot;Progress's biggest failure has been its inability to nurture and protect right relationships,&quot; writes Swenson. And he suggests that the remedy is a return to a safer and saner lifestyle, one where people are thought of as priorities instead of problems, time is considered an ally rather than an enemy, and material wealth is less about making money thanit is about living meaningfully.<br />While the price of progress can exact a painful toll, through the establishment of healthy limits, such as learning how to say no to over-commitment, Swenson advocates that a renewed emphasis on voluntary simplicity not only enhances one's standard of living, it is fast becoming a necessity for survival.<br />Swenson's frequent use of statistics, figures and graphs --- especially as he diagnoses the symptom of pain caused by overload --- can itself be somewhat burdensome at times, but it is well worth wading through the material to get to the marrow of his message: the prescription of margin for a prognosis of health.<br />As proven and prescribed by Dr. Swenson, MARGIN acts as a timely antidote to what ails modern man. And with sales well into six figures since its initial release in 1992, the book has earned its well-deserved place among contemporary Christian classics. Explaining complex change in context is Swenson's calling card, and his cure for it is a cause for celebration. Consider it a house call from heaven with hope and help for the soul.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-01-24

He's a master at employing metaphors to create lasting images. Who can forget the floor-plan motif he used to illustrate the Lord's Prayer in THE GREAT HOUSE OF GOD? Or the excess-baggage imagery in TRAVELING LIGHT? These are just two examples from his many adult books; his children's books paint even clearer pictures of the truth he is so passionate about and so determined to convey.    In NEXT DOOR SAVIOR, you get what you've come to expect from a Lucado book, with a couple of twists. For one thing, each chapter focuses on a specific Bible story and is therefore independent of the others. In that respect, it's more like a devotional book or a collection of sermonettes, which is fine unless that's not what you're expecting. The second thing is that the last 40 or so pages comprise a discussion guide, which again is fine unless you're not expecting it, which I wasn't. (It's similar to --- but nowhere nearly as annoying --- as the trend in fiction toward teasing the reader by placing the first chapter of an author's next book at the end of that author's current book. You turn the page, and instead of a continuation of the story you're reading, you bump into something entirely new. It's a whole lot worse in fiction than it is here, believe me.) The discussion guide could certainly be seen as a value-added enhancement, but a little warning would have helped the flow by preparing the reader to expect an end to the text long before the number of pages ran out.    The idea here is to present Jesus as the man He was on earth, with His divinity fully intact --- a next-door neighbor as real as the people in your everyday life, but as different from those people as humankind is from, well, God. In attemptingto illustrate this, Lucado frequently inserts elements of contemporary American life into stories from the Bible. Take Chapter 7, \\"What Jesus Says at Funerals,\\" for example. It's based on the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. Max the Storyteller sets the scene: The chapel in Bethany is \\"library quiet.\\" You're sitting there remembering how \\"just last month you took the guy out to lunch. You and Lazarus told jokes over nachos.\\" Mary and Martha occupy the front pew, their faces streaked with sunlight filtered by the stained-glass windows. And then Jesus arrives \\"wearing a tie, though you get the impression he rarely does. His collar seems tight and his jacket dated.\\" This is pure, unadulterated, classic Lucado, the kind of writing that has endeared him to countless readers and those loyal fans who own the entire collection of his works.    Familiarity, though, often breeds predictability, and readers looking for a new focus or a deeper treatment of the material won't find it here. What they will find is the genuine warmth that radiates from everything Lucado writes. And that goes a long way toward making this book, like his others, a worthwhile read.	2004-01-24

As she unfolds her spiritual pilgrimage, she acknowledges &quot;A literature scholar would say there are too many 'ruptures' in the 'narrative.' But she might also say that ruptures are the most interesting part of any text, that in the ruptures we learn something new.&quot; Her story, with all its &quot;ruptures,&quot; makes for absorbing reading.<br />As the child of a Reform Jewish father and a lapsed Southern Baptist mother, Winner grew up with both a Christmas tree and a menorah. Her parents raised her in the Jewish faith, and she details how she embraced Orthodox Judaism in college. &quot;But, gradually my Judaism broke,&quot; she writes.<br />Although Winner is a scholar, with degrees from Columbia and Cambridge universities, she found the spark for her conversion to Christianity in a surprising book: After reading AT HOME IN MITFORD by Jan Karon, &quot;I thought, 'I want what they have,' &quot; she admits somewhat abashedly. She found herself &quot;courted by a very determined carpenter from Nazareth,&quot; one who haunted her dreams.<br />This conversion, just several years after her former wholehearted conversion to Orthodox Judaism, caused some acquaintances to be skeptical that Christianity would stick: they wondered aloud if she would convert again to something else. And indeed Winner, like most honest Christians, finds that as much as she is at home now in her new faith, she is still plagued by doubt: &quot;Sometimes, lately, I feel a sort of sinking staleness...this isn't working, I don't believe this Christian thing anymore, this is just some crazy fix I've been on....&quot; But she also realizes about her Christianitythat &quot;How to fall in love is not, now, what I need to learn. What I need to learn, maybe what God wants me to learn, is the long grind after you've landed.&quot;<br />It is in the &quot;long grind&quot; that Winner finds she cannot divorce Judaism, hard as she tries: giving away and selling her Jewish library, eating forbidden foods, trading in her Hebrew prayer book for the Episcopal BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER. When you convert, Winner writes, you lose all sorts of things: your vocabulary, your prayers, and many special relationships. As Winner tries to adapt to the Christian liturgical calendar, she finds her life still flowing in the rhythms of the Jewish holidays. Even as she gives away the trappings of her Jewish life, she finds she has not given up the way she sees the world, or the Jewish words she knew for God.<br />With resolve, it seems, to master every aspect of her new faith, Winner grapples with all of its accoutrements: confession, giving up reading for Lent, finding a church, taking the Eucharist, trying to be chaste. She puzzles over the idea of &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;; struggles with prayer (&quot;I have a hard time praying. It feels, usually, like a waste of time&quot;). Most compelling are her clear-eyed observations of her own shortcomings as she grows in her Christianity and her willingness to be vulnerable with the reader. She refuses to sugarcoat her experiences; rather, she offers frank and perceptive commentary on how real faith --- Jewish or Christian --- looks, with all its bumps and bruises. As she plumbs the rituals and disciplines of both faiths, there is the unspoken invitation to Christians to examine the Jewish roots of their beliefs.<br />Her rebuilding of her Jewish library metaphorically shows her burgeoning realization that she can welcome her Jewishness as it shapes how she sees Christianity, how she reads the Bible, how she thinks about Jesus --- and that this is the way forward.<br />Winner's thoughtful book, full of the longing, doubt, humor and poignancy that can accompany a search for God, is a captivating read and builds bridges for dialogue for all readers, no matter what their faith.<br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby	2004-01-23

What's more, Jan is a licensed marriage and family therapist in private practice and the Franks are actively involved at a large church where they teach couples classes and mentor newlyweds.<br />With considerable candor, the authors each share stories of dealing with their own history and baggage, effectively drawing readers into the dialogue. The Franks use the mnemonic device of rhyme to suggest that &quot;you must first face the negative patterns you have from your history, then trace them back to their roots, take steps to erase them, and replace them with healthier patterns.&quot;<br />The authors mean to mark the distinction between history and baggage. According to them, &quot;our history is made up of the events and experiences that shape our lives,&quot; while &quot;our baggage is the emotional response to our history.&quot; Unclaimed baggage is what we ignore or deny rather than identify as ours and deal with appropriately, they explain.<br />Whether it's a duffle bag of depression, a flight bag of fear or a garment bag of guilt, readers are encouraged to reclaim their baggage and move forward in dealing with it. Meanwhile, the authors successfully employ the use of alliteration to aid readers in the recall of three types of historical baggage: treasured traits, tarnished traditions and tabled transgressions.<br />As the authors define them, treasured traits are the positive qualities developed within our families and other significant relationships, while tarnished traditions are the repetitive patterns, expectations and predispositions we have adopted from our histories. Tabled transgressions are the obvious and obscure losses we've all experienced but haven't considered significant in our present or future.<br />With action steps included at the end of each chapter, readers are moved to carry on the work of claiming their baggage after reading about how to do it. As the authors state, &quot;once you've claimed your baggage, you can unpack it, unload the burden of it from your marriage, and learn to travel lighter to the glory of God.&quot;<br />UNCLAIMED BAGGAGE is an excellent resource for couples, whether engaged, newly wed or those celebrating decades of married life together. By applying its timeless truths for properly dealing with the past, couples will be well on their way to a stronger and healthier marriage. Think of it as luggage for a lifetime of growth in love.<br />   --- Reviewed by Sean Fowlds	2004-01-23

Convinced by her legalistic church that her daughter is demon-possessed, Alice's mother relies on their pastor to heal Alice. When that fails, Alice ends up in an institution, escapes, and takes to the streets.    Through a couple of homeless gay guys, Tweedle Dweeb and Tweedle Dumb, Alice meets a semi-eccentric woman named Faye, a \\"cat lady\\" who has agreed to help nurse her newfound pet, Cheshire, back to health. But she proves to be much more than a healer of felines --- she becomes the means by which Alice has the greatest hope of finding her own healing.    Yes, the Alice in Wonderland references are intentional, and Melody Carlson handles them skillfully. Even more impressive is her deft handling of Alice's mental state ---her vacillation between lucidity and paranoia, her resistance to medication and other forms of treatment, her brilliant insights and delusional \\"knowledge.\\" Everything rings true here; Carlson's peek into the mind of a schizophrenic is eminently believable. Christians who have suffered from mental illness, or whose loved ones have, will find much here that resonates with their own experiences.    With this book, Carlson has established herself as an author with genuine crossover potential. Her characters come across as living, breathing people --- quite an achievement in any genre. Alice is an intelligent but otherwise fairly ordinary person, so unlike the typical female protagonists (you know the kind --- beautiful, headstrong young women with emerald-green eyes) who populate many CBA novels. As the most fully developed example of authentic Christlikeness in the book, Faye is wonderfully different from the cardboard Christian role models you see in both fiction and nonfiction. Simon, Faye's nephew, is neither ruggedly handsome nor strongand silent --- he's just a guy, a caring and giving guy, but a guy nonetheless. And that makes him all the more appealing. Like Anne Tyler, Carlson knows that ordinary people become extraordinary when you take the time to examine their lives.    FINDING ALICE is a truly remarkable book for a CBA publisher. WaterBrook deserves a great deal of credit for publishing it. Carlson, with 90 books and numerous awards to her credit, could easily have bailed on the CBA had she not found a willing Christian publisher.    I could quibble about a few details, and in fact will. Quibble number one: When Alice gets high for the first time and is found out by her mother and some finger-pointing church ladies, she suddenly finds the inner resolve to stand up to them. Now, I'm not saying where I got this insight from, but as I understand it, grass doesn't exactly make a person assertive --- goofily defiant maybe, but not imbued with steely determination like Alice is. Number two: The key to understanding the \\"golden key\\" that Alice believes God has set before her becomes obvious too soon, in a scene in which she has been invited to help decorate for a Christmas party. Number three: Toward the end, starting with a chapter titled \\"Waking,\\" there's a subtle shift in the way Carlson tells the story that causes it to lose some of its immediacy.    Number four is a bit more than a quibble for me, but I suspect it won't be a problem for many, if not most, readers. It's the way one storyline ends. The problem --- and I can't be more specific here --- arises in the last three pages, in which something predictable happens despite all indications to the contrary and Carlson's efforts to make the reader think it can't happen. But I could feel it coming and I was hoping it wouldn't. It tied up one sub-story a bit too neatly, which was disappointing, though I do think many readers will love it. And to Carlson's credit, she did leave a few ends dangling, most notably Alice's complicated relationshipwith her mother.    The bottom line is that FINDING ALICE is one of those rare finds in the Christian market, a novel that is satisfying on so many levels. To name a few, there's authenticity, plotline, characterization and --- the trickiest element of all, it seems, for most CBA authors --- dialogue. Highly recommended.	2004-01-23

All too often, the most well-meaning Christians preach peace among different races and religions, but we don't practice it --- we're far too busy staying comfortable in our own denominations and churches that mirror our own habits and beliefs (and anyone who has read conservative pundit David Brooks's analysis of &quot;red&quot; versus &quot;blue&quot; America, referring to liberals and conservatives, will know that this is true).<br />Jackson not only practices what she preaches (she and her husband/writing partner Dave attend an interracial Christian worship community), she writes about it, too. Her protagonist, Jodi Baxter, and husband Doug live in Chicago's diverse Rogers Park neighborhood, having moved there in order to answer the Lord's call to build bridges across the racial divide. Caucasian Jodi, a third-grade teacher, decides to attend a spiritual women's conference with her principal, African-American Avis. The two women couldn't be more different: Jodi is casual, bubbly and enmeshed in a happily chaotic life with a spouse and two teenagers, while the elegant and low-key Avis lives alone and seems to be quite happy to keep it that way.<br />But if Jodi and Avis seem to be worlds apart, they find that their differences are infinitesimal compared to those between themselves and the women with whom they are thrown together in their conference prayer group. From irrepressible Florida to reluctant Yo-Yo to near-perfect Stu to nervous Chanda and beyond, this is a group that could have only been brought together by administrative chance --- or by God's hand.<br />Almost immediately God's hand is felt when one member's son is injured and the group decides to keep a nightlong prayer vigil by the woman's side. After that experience, &quot;Prayer Group 26&quot; (as they were designated by stickers on their conference packets) decides to keep in touch via email --- and to take on their special name, derived from a chance remark by Yo-Yo and shown to be nearly perfect by Ruth (a Messianic Jew whose Yiddishisms are a funny counterpoint to the African-American women's speech patterns).<br />Soon the &quot;Yada Yadas&quot; have made all sorts of plans, including a round robin of visits to each other's home churches. But their true camaraderie is not without problems and pain. Misunderstandings and miscommunications are frequent, and Florida's quest to be reunited with her long-lost daughter causes one of the worst of these. Still, each time the Yada Yadas find fault or don't connect, their powerful individual faiths shine through. Jackson's depiction of these very different yet very sincere faiths is one of the shining strengths of her book. The author does not try to pretend that just because we are one in Christ Jesus, we are one and the same.<br />THE YADA YADA PRAYER GROUP is a truly refreshing read. However, it's also a book with a deeply felt message. All along, we have seen the prayer group through Jodi's perspective, and her perspective is that of a woman who has led a happy and comfortable life. She brushes away the dissatisfactions that surface from time to time or tries to deal with them in a super-efficient, elementary-school teacher way. Finally, Jodi winds up --- very much through the fault of her own --- in a situation that cannot be dealt with via email, or swept up into a casserole like so many leftovers. It's what she and the Yada Yadas do then that makes this little novel a must-read.<br />   --- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick	2004-01-23

Graham gets a chance to have some fun with her characters while poking a bit of fun at the church --- something I happen to adore. Esmeralda is an immediately likable character, an older woman who does not abide nonsense and takes utter pleasure in dispensing her always practical advice to others, even those \\"others\\" she knows will never heed her counsel. Mainly, of course, church folk.    But, as Graham wisely knows, it's those very same church folk who will be the ones to rally to support people in need and distress, as the church's Willing Workers do throughout --- helping those who grieve, those who are saddled with overwhelming responsibilities, those who need a warm casserole as much as a warm hug. Esmeralda finds herself on the receiving end of their generous gifts of time and food when she assumes responsibility for a woman dying of AIDS.    Throughout the book, Esmeralda writes letters to her lifelong friend Beatrice, a literary device Graham uses skillfully. Through the letters back and forth, we gain greater insight into what makes Esmeralda tick, and through her friend we eventually see a flawed aspect of her nature.    Anyone who has lived in the South, the real South, is bound to be amused by Graham's ear for the \\"language\\" --- the way real Southerners express their thoughts, their choice of words, and their charming way of simply making up words. Thus Esmeralda advises Beatrice that the \\"onliest doctor\\" she needs is Dr. Scholl, seeks out a \\"notary republic\\", and quotes Charles \\"Splurgeon\\" throughout. The book also has some hilarious moments, as when Esmeralda must make up a name for the dying Hispanic woman and can only think of \\"Carmen Miranda\\" (which admittedly may not be funny to those too young to remember her), or when she tries to resolve an immigration problem, gets shuffled from one office to another in the courthouse, and finally takes it upon herself to enter a door marked Problem Resolution Office, only to discover 45 minutes later that it's an IRS office.    And Graham's use of imagery shines throughout the book: \\"Her pauses are like when the washing machine stops then starts up again,\\" Esmeralda says about Beatrice. Graham has most assuredly done her share of laundry, because only someone who has listened out for the end of the cycle countless times can relate to the way those pauses sound like a person holding her breath. \\"If Clara can't climb down your family tree to the bare roots, you don't get no clean bill of health,\\" she says of another church member.    But there are some missteps. Esmeralda uncharacteristically comments on the number of Christians killed and tortured around the world, something that doesn't sound like her but instead sounds like the author trying to educate her audience. Then there's the mandatory salvation scene, in which one character practically grills another to find out if she led a woman to the Lord in precisely the \\"right\\" way. That one really grated on me.    Finally, toward the end of the book, Esmeralda convinces a godly man named Carl that he should cut what she calls his \\"pigtail\\" (a ponytail, maybe?) because no woman would want a man with hair like that, and, as she tells him, \\"it don't look right for a Christian man to go around looking like a leftover hippie.\\" Here's a kind, godly man, but he isn't quite up to snuff as a Christian example because he wears his hair wrong? I hope not. And I suspect there are plenty of women out there, even Esmeralda's age, who would gladly accept a ponytail on a thoughtful, caring man.    Despite those and other minor flaws, what it all comes down to is this: MERCY ME is an enchanting, fun read, and Graham is an author to watch. Let's hope she has more in mind for Esmeralda.	2004-01-23

Lewis devotee knows that Lewis died the same day as President Kennedy. Though it's not mentioned in the jacket copy --- and the book includes no introduction --- that forty-year commemoration might have been the catalyst for this new compilation of 366 daily readings drawn from what the publisher calls his (capital-letter) Signature Classics: MERE CHRISTIANITY, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, THE GREAT DIVORCE, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN, MIRACLES and A GRIEF OBSERVED, plus (apparently perceived in some other category) THE WEIGHT OF GLORY and THE ABOLITION OF MAN.<br />Drawing on this bank, this book provides food for thought more than for devotion. Readers looking for a devotional aid will need to make a conscious leap to apply the material to a personal line of prayer. And yet the presented theological, philosophical and sociological points, all focused by Lewis's Christian worldview, do serve to draw the reader to a keener awareness of God's presence, character and role; his being, creations and relationships.<br />The one-page selections have been deftly arranged by Patricia Klein, who in times past edited the annual Cahill calendars featuring quotable lines from Lewis and his Inkling cohorts. She has given each reading a clear but not clever title that orients readers going into a selection and grounds them coming out: &quot;Love the Sinner . . .&quot;, &quot;The Real Test&quot;, &quot;Nice Is Not Enough&quot;, and &quot;How Marriage Reconciles.&quot;<br />Her selections are well organized. Each stands on its own, but many, usually from one source, for four or five days at a time thematically build on one another. We spend a week in March, for example, noting the pitfalls of pride (from MERE CHRISTIANITY) before being introduced to &quot;Humility 101&quot; (from THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS).<br />Although the first SCREWTAPE entry (January 13) includes a paragraph that explains the first-person, demonist voice of this novel, an unwary reader unfamiliar with that book's tongue-in-cheek style can be confused later on. Trying to head off said confusion, Klein has added an italicized tag onto each SCREWTAPE reading (i.e., &quot;Screwtape reveals a powerful tool for distraction&quot;).<br />I personally connected most with Lewis, the man, in his readings from A GRIEF OBSERVED, in which he mourns the death of his wife. But I also connected with Lewis's God in selections from MERE CHRISTIANITY and THE WEIGHT OF GLORY.<br />The volume is nicely packaged: a ribbon bound into the spine to mark your place, a table of contents on a part-title page at the beginning of each month, three book-end indices. When I turned a page, I first glanced to the bottom, anticipating an occasional date-specific Lewis-biographical event: a book publication, an academic achievement, a family birth or death --- November 22, 1963, &quot;Lewis dies at 5:30 P.M. at The Kilns, one week short of his sixty-fifth birthday. . . &quot;<br />Most readings are three, four, five times longer than the one I cite below (September 27), which is the shortest in the book. As compiled in A YEAR WITH . . . Lewis only occasionally quotes Scripture and never more aptly than here, speaking of the apostle Peter's seaside conversation with Jesus: &quot;There are questions at issue between Christians to which I do not think we have been told the answer. There are some to which I may never know the answer: if I asked them, even in a better world, I might (for all I know) be answered as a far greater questioner was answered: 'What is that to thee? Follow thou Me.' &quot;<br />   --- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence	2004-01-23

It's a challenging time for the whole nation --- and for Mark, whose Texas upbringing did little to prepare him for the hippies he observes, the black neighbor he befriends, or the homeless woman he meets.    The woman, whom Mark dubs the Creature, makes curious and disturbing comments that keep him coming back for more. In a lucid moment, she tells him a chilling story that will have ramifications throughout his adolescence --- even after his family moves once again, this time back to Texas and the tiny community of Fred. By now, though, Mark is a preteen who has adopted the clothing style of Ohio's hippies, something that does not set well with the jeans-and-cowboy-boots crowd in his new school.    Mark makes periodic stabs at trying to fit in, even to the point of using less-than-perfect grammar. But as a PK (preacher's kid), the situation at times looks pretty hopeless, even after he converts to denim. Worst of all, he begins to question the very existence of God, placing him squarely in no-man's land, a place right smack between the world and the kingdom. The clouds part and the sun breaks through, though, when his father announces that the family will take a summer vacation to California, the Mecca of Mystical Hipness, the place where Mark is sure he'll find the answers to all those adolescent questions that plague him.    What ensues is a comedy of errors, the kind of car trip that makes participating parents ask each other, \\"What were we thinking?\\" There are the usual car problems that become unusual in a PK's world and strange encounters with even stranger people. And Mark's father's unwavering trust in the professional courtesy of one clergyman to another results in a priceless visit with \\"Elder Nelson.\\" Finally, the family reaches California --- where an unlikely link to the Creature jolts Mark out of his state of spiritual uncertainty, and where he also discovers his true identity as a pale and skinny kid from East Texas.    Brad Whittington writes like he knows his stuff, and well he should --- his parents even attest to the semi-autobiographical nature of WELCOME TO FRED. His inability to fit in rings true on so many levels. Only a PK can reveal how it feels to be treated differently and to have a different set of expectations placed on you simply because of your father's (or mother's) occupation as a pastor. Only someone who has struggled with the more difficult questions of faith --- and the more difficult people of faith --- can write with such candor about one boy's efforts to come to terms with the foundations of Christian belief. And only someone who has felt like a misfit could write in such authentic detail about what it's like to have a psychedelic spirit in a country-western culture.    What elevates this book above others of its kind --- if in fact there are others of its kind in the Christian market --- is Whittington's ability not only to create believable, well-rounded characters but also to give them believable, well-rounded dialogue to work with. Getting both the characterization and the dialogue right seems to be a rarity. But Whittington proves himself to be well in control of both, and his attention to detail is superb.    Shortly after its release, a Broadman & Holman editor told a group of writers that they should use Whittington's book as a model for the quality the publisher is looking for in future novels. That's a good sign, because WELCOME TO FRED is among those recent fiction releases in the Christian market that have raised the bar, which in turn will force authors to produce higher-quality work.    WELCOME TO FRED is a highly enjoyable read, one that is likely to resonate particularly with those who survived a '60s adolescence.	2004-01-23

Instead he has found another writing partner, Greg Dinallo, and has begun a new series of thrillers starting with BABYLON RISING. Dr. LaHaye says that he is more excited about this than any of the other books he has ever written. That's quite a comment from the author of more than forty books, including the Left Behind series that has sold over 60 million copies! But within the first few pages of BABYLON RISING, the reader will begin to share his enthusiasm and become totally engrossed in this supernatural adventure.<br />Michael Murphy teaches Biblical Archaeology and Prophecy at Preston College --- not exactly an &quot;A&quot; list course. To enhance his classroom lectures and satisfy his desire to authenticate the Bible, he seeks and uncovers ancient artifacts that are directly tied to Biblical events. This scholar/adventurer image makes him somewhat of a campus hero and students flock to hear him bring the Bible to life.<br />For the reader's enlightenment, chapters are interspersed with the story of King Nebuchadnezzer, the world's most powerful ruler, and Daniel, the young Israeli slave who fearlessly interprets the King's dreams. This writing technique serves to underscore the role that faith plays in the lives of people throughout history. Faith that allows a young slave to stand fearlessly before the most powerful man on earth and tell him the hard truth, knowing that his God will protect him regardless of the King's reaction. Faith that allows a small-town college professor to stand up to evil forces in order to unearth ancient Biblical artifacts that glorify God, the enemy of evil.<br />While Michael Murphy is busy with his latest find, there are those who want to discredit him, his faith and his God. The evil ones are powerful and have the ability to captivate, intimidate and seduce the weak and the greedy into service for the Enemy. With the help of a reporter and a ruthless mogul they begin a campaign to destroy the credibility of Christians everywhere. These supernatural beings take on different forms, moving swiftly to accomplish their evil deeds, and soon the headlines are full of stories about Christians threatening to blow up the United Nations, building bomb factories in church basements, and killing those who get in their way.<br />The story moves at a rapid clip, with short chapters that carry the reader from one set of protagonists to another and back in time to the court of Nebuchadnezzer. There is enough action to satisfy the most avid adventure fans, humor and romance, likable characters to cheer for and evil villains to hate. But even more exciting, we have a new series to look forward to that unapologetically offers moral and philosophical anchors --- a series that elevates both man and God and is not afraid to depict the chilling aspects of evil.  <br />   --- Reviewed by Maggie Harding	2004-01-23
