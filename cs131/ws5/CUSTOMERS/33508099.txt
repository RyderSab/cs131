I literally stayed up a full night to finish it, once I started I could not turn the pages fast enough. I found myself chuckling in one instant and then having to read a paragraph again due to blurred vision from crying. I grew to really care about the characters, finding myself rooting them on and feeling the emotions that were smoothly drawn out in the book. I truely believe that Ms. Fielding has a total masterpiece with this one! Although the book is finished I still feel myself thinking about the characters, so the book really stays with you long after the last page is turned. And, quite honestly..I feel I could read this book again, too..which is remarkable because I am usually not one to do that at all.	2005-03-21

This is truely one of the most heartwarming and captivating stories I have read in quite some time! The storyline was something very new and exciting. Unlike any book I have read. I found myself bursting into tears one minute, then biting my nails in suspense as Mary (Blaine) runs for her life! My husband even got a tad angry at me because I brought this book in the car and read on our way out to eat dinner...I could not put it down..I was so captivated. I believe you will not regret reading this wonderfully written book, it will touch your heart and make you take a look around your life as to what is REALLY important in your life.	2005-03-20

The first A cry in the Night was read because I saw the movie and wanted to see how much things were going to change in the book version. To be honest I love a great suspense novel, but I thought MHC would not appeal to me because she was an older woman and I thought maybe she would be outdated. Well, I was totally wrong! This author had me turning the pages swiftly from the first page to the very last one! I plan on reading more of her books from now on. I won't go into any details on what the book is about, that has been covered by other reviews very well, I will tell you to be prepared for a chilling rollercoaster ride with lots of twists and turns in the plot.

The two main characters, I hate to say, did not really have a relationship- all it seemed like they were doing was having sex (come on- for EIGHTEEN HOURS STRAIGHT! PUHLEESE!) But, they fell in love anyway..I mean she did not know anything about him except for him being a cop..she even says that in the book. I don't know, maybe I was having an off night, but I enjoyed Ms. Howard's books in the past. I loved Mr. Perfect. Oh! Stay away from To die for..it was terrible. I have not given up on Ms. Howard and will read her again..but lately I have been disappointed.	2005-03-11

I have read all of Staub's most recent suspense books and this one was no exception as far as keeping me swiftly turning the pages and sitting on the edge of my seat. This book was well developed and all the characters were well rounded. Some people have said negative things about how Staub changes the viewpoint from one character to the next, but I love it. It is like getting a couple of books in one! I have never been able to figure out who the killers are, she keeps it well hidden, but then all the hints throughout the book have me kicking myself that I could not figure it out. Great book!

By the title you would almost think it was a light summer romance. Well, you would be mistaken..it starts from the first chapter as a gripping, heartpounding suspense and a race to find Emily in five days. I really liked the characters and could relate to them. I loved the retired FBI guy, Geary, he was great! If I was ever in this situation, I would definitely want him on my side. I thought it was so sweet how much in love Will was with his wife and how he wanted to stop at nothing to find her. I found myself more than once biting my nails nervously as the countdown of the 5 days grew to a close. The ending was exciting, I think the book was well developed. This author has talent, I look forward to reading more of her work.	2005-03-06

Lots of suspense books are based on the wife leaves husband due to abuse, but this book was unique and well worth your time and money.

Crusie has a way of making her characters leap off the page and have you laughing out loud with her spunky humor.

Hughes before she started writing her comedy romance books. I LOVED them! This book was suspenseful and thrilling with a touch of her humor rolled into the plot. Although the book was scary, I still found myself smiling at some of Hughes' slight humor. I do think you would love these and I wish Ms. Hughes would write more of these types of books. I am currently reading Night Kills (another one of her early suspense novels--it is excellent, also) this is such a talented author!

I was a tad disappointed in the fact that it was more romance involved and only got spooky at the beginning and the very end of the book. The two main characters sort of got on my nerves about how they were so very deceitful to each other, but always seemed to forgive one another for horrible things that they did to each other. That was kind of unbelievable, but then again it is a fiction novel. It was good enough for me to finish the entire book, but like I said I was told it was more a paranormal novel so I kept waiting for something spooky to happen chapter after chapter. If you like just romance novels, then this is for you. If you like a good spooky novel, before reading this, I would suggest you look elsewhere first. <br /> <br />	2005-03-05

This was unique in the plot, but I found it somewhat confusing because it hops around slightly from the past and the present. It starts out in a courtroom where the main character is fighting for custody of her young children from her very odd husband. I am glad I read the book because it does get very suspenseful when her husband, who loses custody vanishes with her children. I just found that, although her husband is mind controlling, the main character seems a tad on the unstable side, too. I just thought she should have seen it coming, but try it, maybe I was having a mind lapse. See what you think.	2005-03-05

I have read all Staub's book, except for All the way home, which I plan on purchasing very soon. Staub has become one of my favorite authors. She writes her books in present tense, which was different, but now I wish more authors wrote that way. It really makes the book much more suspenseful and heart pounding. I do have to say, this was not Ms. Staub's best but still quite worth your time. The plot I felt was truely unique. I felt for some of the characters so much that I was mourning them when something bad happened (I am trying to be vaque, so I do not ruin your experience) and that has got to be a good sign in a book.

Loved it	My husband knows of my love of reading and on a whim he picked this book out as a surprise. Well, since he picked it out and I had never heard of Jennifer Crusie, it sat on the counter for a few days. My husband finally made a comment and to make him happy, I started reading. Boy! He did great! I could have kicked myself for letting it sit that long in my house unread! I loved the way the main character was so human! Most of the romance books I have read, the women have been beautiful with model thin bodies (yeah, like that really exists in the real world AND she is still single!). I was truely laughing out loud at more than half of the book. After I finished this, I ran out and bought ALL of Crusie's books, and now waiting for her to release another. You will NOT be disappointed!	2004-12-12

Very intense and a real nail biter! I loved the way the author put you in the minds of all the characters involved. I started the book late in the eveining and  ended up staying up all night long. There just was not a stopping point, I literally could not put the book down until I found out if Emily was able to escape her real-life nightmare! Oh! My poor nails! The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the ending. I wish the author would have told in more detail of what happened to all the characters. Still, I would recommend this to anyone who loves suspense. It was a wonderful fast paced book. I have no idea why the other people say this book was slow and boring. Are they sure it was THIS book they were reading?!?	2004-12-12
