The Republican party has drifted so far from its principles as to be completely unrecongizable.  Its foreign policy has been hijacked by neoconservatives, a radical ideology whose roots were in the democratic party until they defected under Nixon.  Neoconservativism is best left in the realm of \\"think tanks\\" and universities. It's an expensive and hopelessly naive pipe dream. We will be in Iraq as far as the eye can see, it will cost 50 to 100 billion per year for the next 5, 10, 15 years. Hundreds of US Soldier's lives will be lost each year we're there. The foolish pipe dream of the neocons is an American empire and the imposition of democracy by force.       The \\"Social Fundamentalists\\" - as Whitman kindly refers to them, are the followers of nutcase radicals like Robertson, Dobson, and Fawell whose ultimate goal is American theocracy. They are actually haters of democracy - a system which necessitates cooperation and tolerance of opposing points of view to work. They truly seek the erradication of democracy, as they believe they are on a \\"mission from God\\".        And what ever did happen to the concepts like \\"fiscal conservativism\\"?  How 'bout states rights and a small federal government?  It has to be a laughable embarrassment to true Republicans. Government has never been bigger, and we have never been deeper in debt. Elect a republican, expect fiscal malfeasance, corruption, and huge debts. As the late 90's proved, the economy flies like an eagle when it's unburdend with enormous federal deficits.    Put this all together and what do you have? A large militaristic, corrupt, imperialistic government that spends recklessly, racking up huge deficits, where issues like a woman's reproductive rights are being set by social fundies. A government that aggressively wishes to erradicate the meager saftey nets created by FDR's new deal. A goverment whose agenda is moving aggressively toward unbridled capitalism at the expense of the environment and individual protection.      Not a good scenario, but it's exactly where we're at.    The beef I have with Whitman, who is a brilliant woman, is that she knows exactly what's going on with her party and the adverse effect it will have on this nation. With the democrats nearly powerless, change must occur within the Republican party itself. It's truly up to the moderates to push back, for the sake of the nation, and reclaim the party from the radicals who have hijacked it.    Instead, what do Republican moderates do? Roll over, bend over, fall in line, withdraw, shake their heads - tsk, tsk, write books. What a sickening display. Whitman lacked the courage, even, to release her book before the election.    Although I respect Whitman, I detest her and other Republican moderates for their utter cowardice, and for putting party ahead of country, which is unconscionable given that the Republican party has clearly mutated into a malignancy .	2005-02-18

See, the audience isn't supposed to be AWARE of the camera, just like magicians aren't supposed to make you aware of how the trick is performed. This - of course, goes against the grain of the MTV school of filmmaking were the the camera appears to be mounted on a pneumatic drill, and the goal of the cinematographer is to make you dizzy by zooming in and out as rapidly as possible.  The goal is to suspend disbelief, support the action - and, where possible, enhance with subtle visual metaphore on a level that truly works at the subconscious level. The best cinematography is when you're not aware of it consciously... a thankless job.  This book is a roadmap of how to do that. Many cinematographers today are hotdogs; and the equivalent of hambone actors. Didn't read this book, obviously.     <br /> <br />In a sense, cinematography (like editing and direction) works best when you're not aware of it.  How do you tell a bad actor? When you're aware of their acting.  How do you tell bad cinematography? ... <br /> <br />This book has become timeless and it deserved to.  This along with the American Cinematographer Manual are the only two texts you need. I would read each 3 times apiece before I bought four other books on the subject.	2004-11-20

I have criticized its flagrant historical inaccuracies, particularly concerning the strategy of appeasement prior to WWII.  Also, the cherry picking of history is remarkable.  So, here is an author who \\"gets away with\\" historical inaccuracies and cherry picking to make his case.<br />However, in terms of pure entertainment value, the book is oddly as much a fun read for those who are fans of Hannity as it is for those who disagree.  So, while I stand by my criticisms, stepping back a bit, overall I have had fun arguing with the author and pointing out his blatant factual inaccuracies, half truths, and cherry picking. <br />2 stars off for historical misrepresentation and cherry picking.  3 stars for successfully agitating me as a polemist, re-kindling an interest in \\"real\\" accounts of WWII history, and overall entertainment value.

Hannity uses Neville Chamberlain' s \\"appeasement\\" policy as the lynchpin of his whole book.  He blames this policy for WWII and millions of deaths... etc., then later ties appeasement to Carter, and Clinton, etc. (Though, curiously, Uncle Ronnie's Iran Contra scandal is left out. Hmmmm.  Wonder why?)<br />However, his whole retelling of Chamberlain's appeasement policy is just WRONG!  It's not the commonly held view of MODERN WWII scholars - and what is thought in general!  Look below, the Columbia Encyclopedia.  I cite an encyclopedia to illustrate that this is a commonly held view, not some flake academic's opinion.  Look, see?<br />\\"During the 1930s, Chamberlain's professed commitment to avoiding war with Hitler resulted in his controversial policy of \\"appeasement,\\" which culminated in the Munich Pact (1938). Although contemporaries and scholars during and after the war criticized Chamberlain for believing that Hitler could be appeased, recent research argues that Chamberlain was not so naive and that appeasement was a shrewd policy developed to buy time for an ill-prepared Britain to rearm.\\"<br />I could easily cite a dozen sources all saying the same thing.  <BR>Hannity builds his case on a faulty premise and very dated history.

Irrefutable evidence is highly refutable...<br />A. Hannnity's account of Neville Chaimberlain's appeasement policy is a very dated history.  Currently, WWI scholars generally agree that appeasement was a stall tactic to allow Britain time to re-arm.  Chamberlain was feverishly working to re-arm Britain on the one hand, while he \\"appeased\\" Hitler to buy time on the other.<BR>->Common knowledge, but not mentioned in Hanity's book.<br />B. Nixon and Eisenhower respectively ended the Vietnam and Korean wars - two head to head battles with communism, both truncated by Republican administrations.<br />C. No mention of the Iran-Contra scandal under the Reagan administration, where weapons were traded with terrorists to free Ameriacan hostages in Iran.<BR>-> To exclude this renders Hannity's book a joke.  It just does.<br />Buy it and revel in it if you're \\"Hannitized\\" to anyone else who is historically or politically aware, it might be good for a laugh.<br />Suggestion... if you're \\"Hannitized\\" see your nearest faith healer, perhaps s/he can cure you.	2004-04-22

It is believed to be related to obsessive compulsive disorder, except the sufferers delusions are limited to conspiracies conerning Bill and Hillary Clinton.  The affliction extends to a type of paranoia in extreme cases, such as those involved in the Whitewater investigation. Obsessive Clinton Disorder sufferers are known to attribute all Republican administration short coming or failure to the Clinton adminstration, regardless of how obviously delusional it may seem to the non-afflicted. Often sufferers of this horrible mental illness can not speak more that ten minutes without referencing Bill or Hillary Clinton.  The paranoia extends as far as to accusing Clintons of murder, such as the case of Vince Foster and others.  Apart from paranoia, this affliction also impairs the ability to reason, attributing any and all gains in employment, the economy, foreign policy, to preceding Republican administrations, while attributing failures of the present administration to the Clintons. Religious right sufferers often confuse Clinton with the devil, and blame Clinton for a perceived decline in societal morality. Examples of advanced stages of this affliction include Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Jerry Fawell.<br />While there is no cure for Obsessive Clinton Disorder, those close to someone afflicted with this illness are asked to do their best not to laugh out loud at them, though this may at times be quite difficult.

A Bush-Cheney campaign advertisement released March 3 claims the economy was in recession in January 2001 - the latest in a long pattern of attempts by the administration to backdate the beginning of the recession to before the beginning of Bush's term in office.<br />The ad, which is titled \\"Safer, Stronger\\", begins with a graphic stating \\"January 2001, The Challenge:\\" followed by \\"An economy in recession.\\"<br />However, this claim is not generally accepted in the economic community. The National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee - a standing body of top economists - is widely recognized as the quasi-official authority on the timing of recessions. A July 2003 Associated Press story, for example, called it \\"the committee that puts official dates on U.S. economic expansions and contractions. Contrary to the ad's claim, the NBER committee pegged the downturn as beginning in March 2001. After it issued this decision in November 2001, the administration initially endorsed the committee's role: Bush called it \\"the official announcement ... that our economy has been in recession since March,\\" Council of Economic Advisors chairman Glenn Hubbard said NBER \\"made its official declaration that the United States was in recession\\" and the 2002 Economic Report of the President called NBER \\"the arbiter of U.S. business cycle dates\\".<br />- [...]<br />> No one - not even the biggest Bush basher, would blame the timing of the recession on Bush.  Why do they continually try to push the date of the recession back to re-write history?  This administration is creating an impression for themelves, that they are a group of pathelogical liars, and it's backfiring. They should quit it before they do further harm.	2004-03-22

This administration is fueling anti-US sentiments through its unnecessary and irrelevant invasion of Iraq.  It is viewed by the world for exactly what is, a neoconservative, imperialist action. It has provided terrorists with incentive, and at the same time weakened the incentive for nations across the world to work in conjunction with us to erradicate terrorist groups.  This - along with a president whose policies will actually weaken our borders has made us significantly less secure.  Iraq will prove to be a disaster.  <br />Unfortunately, Hannity - and this is why he is a dangerous propagandist, has and will spin any solution to terrorism that is not synonymous with neoconservative imperialism as an appeasement strategy, as he as done in DUFE.  However, the neoconservative imperialistic strategy will fuel further terrorist activity and weaken our ability to erradicate such threats by further alienating the US.<br />I look forward to reading Against All Enemies, by Richard Clarke due out March 22.  Richard Clarke was the Bush counter terrorism czar who served under Bush I, Clinton, and one year of Bush II before resigning. Clarke will establish the pre-existing agenda of the Bush administration to invade Iraq, which echos O'Neill's allegations in The Price of Loyalty.  Clarke will also provide evidence that this administration did anything and everything possible to tie Sept. 11 to Iraq and Iraq to al-Qaeda. He will also cite the numerous frantic warnings his agency provided to the administration regarding al Qaeda's intent to use hijacked planes as weapons - all ignored by this administration.  <br />Clarke considers Bush running under the national security banner \\"outrageous\\".  Unless you're blinded by the right, you should too.	2004-03-21

They said the warnings were delivered in urgent post-election intelligence briefings in December 2000 and January 2001 for Condoleezza Rice, who became Mr. Bush's national security adviser; Stephen Hadley, now Ms. Rice's deputy; and Philip D. Zelikow, a member of the Bush transition team, among others.<br />One official scheduled to testify, Richard A. Clarke, who was President Bill Clinton's counterterrorism coordinator, said in an interview that the warning about the Qaeda threat could not have been made more bluntly to the incoming Bush officials in intelligence briefings that he led.<br />\\"It was very explicit,\\" Mr. Clarke said of the warning given to the Bush administration officials. \\"Rice was briefed, and Hadley was briefed, and Zelikow sat in.\\" Mr. Clarke served as Mr. Bush's counterterrorism chief in the early months of the administration, but after Sept. 11 was given a more limited portfolio as the president's cyberterrorism adviser.<br />Until 9/11, counterterrorism was a very secondary issue at the Bush White House,\\" said a senior Clinton official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \\"Remember those first months? The White House was focused on tax cuts, not terrorism. We saw the budgets for counterterrorism programs being cut.\\"<br /> The issue is addressed in a new book by Mr. Clarke, and in an interview to promote the book on \\"60 Minutes\\" on CBS-TV scheduled for Sunday, Mr. Clarke said that the White House considered bombing Iraq in the hours after the Sept. 11 attacks, even when it became clear that Al Qaeda was responsible.<br />\\"I think they wanted to believe there was a connection, but the C.I.A. was sitting there, the F.B.I. was sitting there, saying, `We've looked at this issue for years - for years, we've looked, and there's just no connection,' \\" Mr. Clarke said. He recalled telling Defense Secretary Rumsfeld that \\"there are a lot of good targets in a lot of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks.\\"<br />-> Keep ignoring the obvious, like the Bush administration did regarding terrorism. And keep buying into the strained and simplistic jargon of people like Hannity.  Attack Kerry all you want, it doesn't matter if Bush runs against Kerry or Abe Vigoda. The central issue of this election is DAMAGE CONTROL for the country. Specifically, the inept ideologue - Bush, needs to go before he can further damage the economy, increase the deficit, employment, social security, the environment, the school system, the middle class and the working poor, and most importantly, NATIONAL SECURITY.	2004-03-21

I took the course as an elective to fill a lit requirement.  It was one of the best courses I've ever taken, and of all the tremendous books that were assigned, this was my favorite.  I have read this at least 1/2 dozen times in my life.  I WAS glad, however, that I had a literary scholar walk through this one.  I doubt I would have appreciated it as much had I not.  I would therefore recommend the critical edition if you're reading this on your own. Modern Fiction - the literary period from circa 1900 to the mid-fifty's, is not everyone's cup of tea and can understand the negative reviews.  The best of these works are dense, relative to today's standards but worthwhile - at least to me. Simply, they don't make'em like this anymore. <br />After reading Heart of Darkness, take another look at Apocalypse Now, the best film adaptation of a novel - ever.   <br />Dark, hypnotic, surreal - Heart of Darkness stands alone as a unique classic of american literature.	2004-03-21

The time before was when I first realized that my boss at the time, Bill Sizemore, was greedy and dishonest. The foundations of my universe shook. What has utterly shocked me today is Al Franken's latest book, \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.\\" <BR>     <BR>I read the book in one sitting. It is an amazing book, and -- if you're a decent, honest, hard-working, patriotic, true-blue conservative who listens to Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and watches Fox News -- an earth-shattering book. <br />To be aboveboard, I must tell you that Franken and I are friends. Well, OK, the truth is I made a wisecrack to him at a book signing, and he looked at me. (Read the book -- the part about Ann Coulter -- and you'll get it.) <br />Until I read this book, I believed the Bill Sizemore/Oregon Taxpayers United mess was a bit of a fluke. (In 2002 I testified against him in a civil trial in which a Multnomah County jury found that his charitable foundation and political action committee had committed fraud and forgery, and that Oregon Taxpayers United had engaged in a pattern of racketeering to obtain signatures on initiative petitions for tax measures drafted by Sizemore.) The spin, the lies, the greed, the disregard for the everyday person -- I thought it was all just a fluke and really limited to this one little pustule of filth that had festered in a little storefront in Clackamas, Oregon. Boy, was I wrong. <br />I believe Franken is telling the truth in his book because it meshes perfectly with what I personally have observed. And I think every decent, honest, hard-working, patriotic, true-blue conservative owes it to himself to read it. Hold your nose if you must -- Franken is as foul-mouthed and crass as his reputationwould lead you to believe (and quite mistakenly believes Christians love Israel because it is the center of prophecies that include the fiery deaths of all Jews) -- but read it anyway. <br />The other day on talk radio, I heard a guy tell an incredulous Lars Larson that he wouldn't believe Rush Limbaugh was a drug addict involved in a drug ring even if Limbaugh himself admitted it. If you're that guy, don't bother reading Franken's book. You will really just drive yourself even more crazy. <br />The leaders we conservatives have trusted have taken advantage of our trust to line the pockets of the wealthy and powerful, and it's time we rose up and drove out these greedy liars. They've hijacked and distorted our belief system for their own gain, and in doing so are destroying our credibility. <br />And if we decent, honest, hard-working, patriotic, true-blue conservatives of this country neglect the duty we have to our children and grandchildren, we will never be able to work with those decent, honest, hard-working, patriotic, true-blue liberal Americans that these lying creeps have taught us to despise. We will never be safe to debate them or, when warranted, to listen to them and maybe even agree with them. We will never be safe to work out our differences or to work together. And we will never be able to build on the all-American sense of unity that burst forth following 9/11, only to disappear shortly thereafter in a cloud of lying, greedy partisan politics. <br />I'm still a decent, honest, hard-working, patriotic, true-blue conservative. But Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and the rest of you lying liars -- I'm through with you! (Read the book, and you'll get that one, too.) <br />Becky Miller of Woodburn is former senior aide to Bill Sizemore, president of Oregon Taxpayers United.	2004-03-18

Franken's book contains one small error.  Due to his book these frauds have been exposed.<br />C'mon conservatives - one guy's running around telling people he won a Peabody at Inside Edition (hahahaha).  Another - in her book Slander, is saying that the NYT delayed coverage of Dale Earnhardt's death due to liberal bias - exept they covered the story, the very next day, on their front page - to cite just two of the many, many examples of incredible journalistic sloppiness and flat out BS. <br />Don't you find this unacceptable?  Don't you think these people are taking advantage of you? Don't you think your intelligence is being insulted - just a bit?

If U.S. intelligence made a mistake then let's admit it -- there are too many America-haters making propaganda with the situation and some of them are right here at home. <br />The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace -- a left-wing organization -- is accusing the Bush administration of purposely misleading the country. But if you buy that argument you also have to buy that Bill Clinton, Dick Gephardt and Tony Blair were also in on the big con for they saw the same intelligence Mr. Bush did and came to the same conclusion: Saddam was harboring deadly weapons and could easily distribute them to terrorists. <br />So the lie theory is bull, but the mistake is real and it's a big mistake. The Bush administration should own up. <br />Maybe it will and there is a slight chance Saddam will tell the world what really happened to the sarin gas and other stuff. A slight chance. <br />Americans are a forgiving people and we all make mistakes. We are now living in an age of ideological demagoguery where honest mistakes are turned into lies by ruthless, dishonest individuals. It makes me sick. <br />But in order to be forgiven the mistake must be acknowledged and so far the President has failed to do that. <br />To be fair he may be waiting for the final Kay report and that's legit. But Mr. Bush should be careful with this WMD deal -- he has alienated many of his supporters with the immigration decision and the president cannot afford to have his core become disenchanted. <br />Full disclosure is always the best policy especially when American troops are dying. Mr. Bush has enjoyed the confidence of most Americans up to this point but that confidence should never be taken for granted. <br />And that's The Memo.	2004-01-25
