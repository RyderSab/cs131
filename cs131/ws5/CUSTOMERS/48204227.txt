Although playing a minor role in the beginning, Charlie asserts himself by the end of the case. <br /> <br />John Quincy Winterslip, a young lawyer from Boston, is on a trip to Hawaii to visit a wealthy relative, Dan Winterslip. En route he is asked to find and destroy an ohia wood box which is in the attic of Dan's San Francisco house. He fails to get the box and learns on his arrival in Hawaii that Dan has been murdered. The leading suspect is Jim Egan, owner of a ramshackle hotel on the beach. The essential clue is a wrist watch with an illuminated dial which is damaged. Motivated by his growing interest in Egan's daughter Carlotta, John Quincy helps Charlie and the police solve the crime. The real hero, however, is Charlie who manages to stay one step ahead of everybody else. <br /> <br />In 1932 Earl Biggers wrote a report to his Harvard classmates on the occasion of the twenty-fifth reunion of the class of 1907. He described how he happened to conceive of creating an ethnic Chinese detective for a mystery story set in Hawaii:\\"But my memories of the islands were rather dim; I dropped into a library to brightem them a bit by a perusal of recent Honolulu newspapers. In an obscure corner of an inside page, I found an item to the effect that a certain hapless Chinese, being too fond of opium, had been arrested by Sergeants Chang Apana and Lee Fook, of the Honolulu Police.\\"  <br /> <br />Because of this chance reading of a newspaper item, Biggers was inspired to use Chan in THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY which was published in 1925 after running serially in the SATURDAY EVENING POST.	2005-06-15

Tefertiller makes a serious effort to give a full account of Earp's life with a special emphasis on his exploits in Dodge and Tombstone. The picture of Earp that emerges is that of a complex man who is cool in a crisis and has the ability to learn from his mistakes.Earp is portrayed as being dependable and courageous - a cut above the ordinary lawman of the Old West. He is also an oportunist who never quite manages to strike it rich. <br /> <br />Earp's long working career included stints as a lawman, boxing referee, gambler, saloon manager, Indian fighter, miner, capitalist and horseman.

Price. The book's editor is Harold J. Chadwick who rewrote the material in a modern style for contemporary readers. <br /> <br />Like all good teachers, Price stresses only a few truths but continually returns to these axioms throughout the text. In many ways his approach to healing is similar to that professed by Kenneth Hagin, Jim Glennon, Dodie Osteen, Charles Capps, Ralph Brittain and Norvel Hayes. Price's main point is that your healing does not depend on a faith developed by you but relies instead on your relationship with Jesus. In fact, your own efforts to manufacture faith will likely get in the way. When you realize that you are actually quite helpless, you will then be able to receive the real faith for healing that only Jesus can give you. <br /> <br />THE REAL FAITH FOR HEALING will give the reader some solid wisdom about healing and is best read in conjunction with the works of Hagin, Glennon, Osteen, Capps, Brittain and Hayes.	2005-04-09

One of the novel's subplots focuses on the long-standing animosity between the townspeople and the Creoles living on the other side of the river. <br /> <br />The fast pace of the story keeps the reader on an emotional roller coaster. There is little waste in Flagg's writing style and it is no coincidence that the book appears to be readily adaptable for either television or the movies.	2005-03-20

The subject is now even more timely than when the book was first published five years ago. <br /> <br />Karen Armstrong shows that religious fundamentalism is a relatively recent phenomenon. Religious fundamentalists feel threatened by society's modern advances which are favored by secularists. The secularists in turn feel threatened by the rigid views of the fundamentalists. It is more important than ever for these opposing groups to find some common meeting ground. After reading Armstrong's book, however, I do not feel optimistic about this possibility occurring anytime in the near future. <br /> <br />THE BATTLE FOR GOD is a well-researched study of a complex topic. One inescapable conclusion to draw from reading the book is that religious fundamentalism is deeply entrenched throughout the world and it is a major cause of much of the planet's present unrest.	2005-02-21

The war is fought between the British and the French. The latter make alliances with several Native American tribes. <br /> <br />The main characters of the novel are Hawkeye, Magua, Duncan Heyward, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro and General Montcalm. Hawkeye is a scout and woodsman. Magua is a rogue member of the Huron tribe and the villain of the story. Duncan Heyward is a young major in the British Army. Uncas is the last member of the Mohican tribe and a protege of Hawkeye. Cora Munro is the daughter of Colonel Munro who is the commander of the British Army at Fort William Henry. Cora is partly of African descent. Alice Munro is Cora's younger half-sister. General Montcalm is a famous French general. <br /> <br />THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is mostly a tale of adventure but it is also a love story which explores the challenges of interracial friendship and romance. The book's writing style is typical of an early nineteenth century novel and for that reason it is not always easy to understand. THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS is a classic which raises questions that still remain relevant today.	2005-01-21

Razov now seeks to reclaim the Russian throne. His strategy includes the use of underwater earthquakes, tsunamis and a massive release of methane to trigger large-scale global warming. The latter will destroy much of the United States and make Siberia the breadbasket of the world. Razov also wants to locate the original crown of Ivan The Terrible which was reported to be on board the Odessa Star when it sank in the Black Sea in 1918. The Grand Duchess Maria survived the sinking of the Odessa Star. <br /> <br />Pitted against Razov are Kurt Austin of the National Underwater & Marine Agency and his old KGB rival Viktor Petrov. Petrov is still working for the Russian government. <br /> <br />FIRE ICE reminds me in some ways of a Tom Clancy story. It is loaded with technological descriptions and explanations. This will be a big plus for many readers. My main criticism is that the book's characters lack depth. In addition, the plot is based on bizarre and incredible possibilities reminiscent of a James Bond novel. In spite of these shortcomings I consider FIRE ICE to be fairly good escapist reading - particularly if the reader has an interest in high tech gadgets.	2005-01-17

Many of the book's characters are real. In spite of its title the novel is not a spy story in the traditional sense but is actually written more in the style of an expose of the inner workings of the CIA. <br /> <br />Jim Angleton remains in the background throughout much of the story while the bulk of the spy action is handled by his young protege, Tony Crespi, who is stationed in Beirut. Angleton's main obsession as Director of Counterintelligence is the search for the infamous Fifth Man who collaborated with Burgess, Maclean, Blunt and Philby. <br /> <br />SPYTIME is an intriguing book for anyone who is interested in the Cold War and the CIA. Buckley writes with some authority about these subjects. The novel's greatest weakness is its lack of suspense and the ending is also a bit of a dud.	2005-01-07

He does not think that this will lead to the end of Christian influence, however, since the post-Christian age that is now beginning still owes much to its Christian heritage. <br /> <br />The most important trend influencing the future of the world, in the author's opinion, is globalization. Geering contends that we are slowly becoming aware of the fact that we all share a common destiny even though our actions do not yet show any widespread consciousness of this fact as we continue to battle each other and treat the earth with disregard. In order to save ourselves from several possible devastating scenarios, the author suggests we adopt a new spirituality which will serve the whole of humankind in much the same way that the great traditional religions have served their own cultures in the past. <br /> <br />Geering writes with clarity and he is very knowledgeable about Christian heritage. The most interesting part of the book is probably the last chapter in which the author attempts to describe a potential global faith for the future. THE WORLD TO COME is a provocative book which deserves to be read by anyone interested in the fate of the planet and its inhabitants.	2004-12-28

This period is known as the First Axial Age.    A Second Axial Age began with the work of Erasmus and Copernicus. This period was marked by an explosion of knowledge which has changed forever how we view ourselves and our place in the universe.    Now the Second Axial Age is coming to an end in Cupitt's view. The great religions are tottering and a new cultural tradition is emerging. At the present time we have a modern world view which is dominated by communication and a constantly changing consensus. There is no more eternal reality for us. Instead we are learning to embrace a world of ceaseless change and exchange. Events are no longer viewed as being controlled from the outside.    Cupitt confesses that he does not know the answer to the Big Question. He urges us to give up the idea that someone else has the answer. Cupitt suggests that we develop the ability to do our own religious thinking while we remain always aware of the shifting consensus.    The author has only a few main points to make in this book. His strength lies in his ability to present his arguments repeatedly with fresh examples. Above all he is never dogmatic. EMPTINESS AND BRIGHTNESS is a serious book which deserves to be read by anyone with an open mind. Cupitt's unique views take some effort to absorb and for that reason his repetitive style is very useful to the reader.	2004-12-12

Satisfied that he knows the identity of the man responsible for the crime, Josh gets permission to carry out a separate operation to be funded by federal Hate Crimes money.

Menden's task is to get the needed proof. <br /> <br />Menden is an appealing hero who seems to be just an ordinary guy caught up in an extraordinary situation. Holt is a complicated character with great strengths and flaws. Both are skillfully drawn by the author who keeps the reader in suspense to the end.	2004-11-17

While visiting a dying racing columnist named Valentine Clark, Thomas Lyon is mistaken for a priest by the confused old man and forced to hear his confession. Since the names mentioned by Valentine are totally unfamiliar to Tom, he disregards the confession as merely the product of Valentine's delirium. <br /> <br />Tom is directing a movie nearby which is inspired by a famous unsolved murder case from the past. Sonia Wells, the wife of trainer Jackson Wells, had died mysteriously of asphyxiation. Sonia was the sister-in-law of Rupert Visborough, a prominent member of the Jockey Club. The careers of both Wells and Visborough were ruined by the suspicion of murder. Valentine had known these two men as well as Sonia and several of her friends. <br /> <br />As the filming progresses numerous attempts are made to stop Tom from completing the project and perhaps solving the mystery of the killing.One of the actors is slashed while riding on the heath by an unknown horseman. Valentine's sister is attacked and her house is ransacked. Tom is stabbed in a crowd. By the time Valentine's nephew is killed it is very clear that the murderer is after Valentine's books and notes which are now in Tom's possession. <br /> <br />I consider WILD HORSES to be one of the better crime novels written by Dick Francis. In addition, the reader can also expect to enjoy some interesting subplots.	2004-11-16

He dies in the emergency room of a hospital, the apparent victim of a ritual killing. Police Detective Sam Purdy asks Dr. Alan Gregory to create a psychological profile of the murderer. Peter's widow Adrienne also asks Alan to find out more about her dead husband's past. She realizes that there is so much she does not know about him. <br /> <br />The dark secret in Peter's background involved his work as a counselor at a wilderness camp for boys during the summer of 1982. Peter and two other young adults were leading a group of six boys on a survival experience. The group was caught in a wildfire and one boy died. The catastrophe converted Peter into a dedicated loner who seemed to have developed a total lack of trust in others. His sense of guilt became so severe that he built a coffin for himself with the date of the fire inscribed at eye level on the inside of the coffin's lid. <br /> <br />Alan concludes that there is a connection between the fire and Peter's murder. He sees the Denver murder as the act of a different person who probably committed suicide shortly after the crime. Detective Dale Hunter disagrees and argues that both murders were done by the same killer. Sam and Alan remain unconvinced and as they continue to follow their own leads, they begin to realize that they will be lucky to finish this case alive. <br /> <br />The author is a clinical psychologist whose greatest strength lies in the development of memorable chacters who come to life in his novels.	2004-11-14

This is a Cold War story and Moto is definitely working as an American ally in STOPOVER:TOKYO. <br /> <br />Moto is much older now and in a very senior but invisible position in Japanese intelligence. He returns to the field only because the situation is critical. Moto is not a real name, only a suffix, and this helps to keep him anonymous. He is described as graying and possessing old world manners. He comes from old aristocracy and was educated in the United States. Moto is fascist and anti-communist. He is still quick with a knife although he is getting too old for violence. <br /> <br />There is always a young couple playing a prominent role in every Mr. Moto story. It usually is an American in the Orient who falls in love with a girl already involved in espionage. Mr. Moto's role seems to be to help the couple and intervene when necessary. What makes STOPOVER:TOKYO different in this instance is that the young people are both professional spies. They are in Tokyo to infiltrate a suspicious organization fronting for the Soviets who strive to create a major international incident damaging to the American position in Japan.

The central theme of the book can be briefly summarized as follows: The Crusades in the Holy Land during the Middle Ages have a direct influence on the troubles in the Middle East today. Holy Wars are a response to trauma. A close look at the First Crusade in 1096 shows that the Jihad had fallen into disuse until it was revived to counter the invasion by European Christians. America and Israel share a strong feeling of identification partly due to the fact that they were both settled by European refugees. America and Israel are now allied in a new Holy War against Muslims. <br /> <br />Karen Armstrong is not a professional historian. Her primary academic field is English Literature and she is also an ex-nun with several years in a Roman Catholic convent in her background. My only criticism of her book is that it may be too ambitious in terms of its scope. There is simply too much material to cover in one volume. The author, however, almost pulls off the impossible because of her formidable skills as both a writer and storyteller.	2004-08-19

Like many other pilgrims her quest takes her through several stages of development as she survives such personal catastrophes as a debilitating illness and a succession of failures in a Roman Catholic convent, a doctoral program at Oxford and even in secondary school teaching. Above all THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE contains a message of hope as it describes how one intrepid wayfarer can endure continual hardships and setbacks. <br /> <br />Armstrong has a scholarly background and she certainly is a gifted writer but her academic training is in neither theology nor biblical studies. She is really an amateur in those fields and consequently approaches her subject with refreshing eagerness. Much of what she knows seems to be the result of her research for A HISTORY OF GOD and her other books. The most interesting part of THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE for me appears near the end of the text when she gives a glimpse into her present state of mind regarding God and religion. In discussing the three Abrahamic traditions the author tends to emphasize their similarities instead of their differences. <br /> <br />I highly recommend THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE to anyone who feels drawn to the lure of the pilgrimmage. Religious fundamentalists, however, will probably not enjoy this book.	2004-08-13

The author describes in particular the development of the personal God which differs significantly from the concepts of God held by many other religions. Above all Armstrong emphasizes how views of God are constantly changing and as a result there exists an incredible diversity of such ideas at any one time in the world. <br /> <br />Armstrong ends her work with the big question of how conceptions of God may change while we continue to live in an age marked by the popularity of fundamentalism and apocalyptism as well as numerous societal ills such as rising rates of crime and drug addiction. We can now of course add terrorism to this list. <br /> <br />A HISTORY OF GOD reflects an enormous amount of research but it still manages to remain highly readable. It will serve as a good introduction to the history of religions as well as an excellent companion study for the books by Elaine Pagels and Karen L.

The latter include the usual Burke types such as prostitutes, pimps, a populist politician, corrupt police and just plain hardened criminals.

We have to look long and hard to find any normal people in this book.<br />The best part of the story focuses on Robicheaux's search for the killers of his mother.

These epistles are Romans, l Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Hebrews. Pagels uses several gnostic sources such as Valintinus and many gnostic opponents including Bishop Irenaeus of Lyons. One of the benefits of reading THE GNOSTIC PAUL is that we learn even more about the diversity that flourished in early Christianity during the first three centuries before Constantine. Pagels is very good at peeling away layer after layer in her study of this period in church history.<br />The author is an excellent writer and the format is easy to follow. The subject matter, however, requires some prior knowledge of Christian gnosticism and a familiarity with the Nag Hammadi documents. For supplementary reading I recommend especially two other books by Elaine Pagels. They are THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS and BEYOND BELIEF: THE SECRET GOSPEL OF THOMAS.	2004-06-16

He begins by asking if the universe is an accidental creation and concludes that our inner and outer universes are far too vast and complex not to be created by design. The footprints of an intelligent creator are found everywhere as in the very nature of human conscience and in our basic need to form relationships which shape our lives.<br />Johnson next turns to a discussion of organized religion which he sees as having a role in trying to interpret and communicate spiritual truths as well as providing a sense of community for its members. He admits that many people seek God within themselves but Johnson chooses to look mostly to the Bible for help in his search. In particular he is interested in what he can learn about Jesus from the Bible and other sources. What intrigues Johnson most is the Jewishness and humanness of Jesus as well as His radical teachings.<br />Johnson refers to himself as a &quot;follower of Jesus&quot; in the style of the earliest Christian believers before the existence of any creeds or formalized Christian religion. Above all he places great importance on the role of the servant which was valued so highly by Jesus Himself.	2004-06-12

The tales are arranged chronologically from 1860 through the emigration of many Southerners to Brazil in 1867.<br />The crisp accounts portray incidents in the lives of the famous such as Confederate Army Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest as well as virtual unknowns like Confederate Army Captain William H. Lawrence and Thomas F. Dornblasser, the Union Army soldier who killed Captain Lawrence. Anyone interested in the history of Alabama and the Civil War will surely enjoy this book.	2004-05-28

The people who collected and buried the library are believed to have been Gnostic Christians. The various scriptures are considered to be examples of texts used by them before Christianity achieved favored status during the reign of Constantine.<br />James Robinson's book is divided into chapters which include English translations of individual  scriptures plus discussions of each by noted biblical scholars. A table is also provided to show the appropriate identifications for the texts comprising the thirteen Nag Hammadi Codices and Papyrus Berolinensis 8502. Among the contributors are Elaine Pagels and Karen L. King. For supplementary reading I recommend especially THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS and BEYOND BELIEF by Pagels as well as THE GOSPEL OF MARY OF MAGDALA by King.<br />I find the subject of Gnosticism to be extremely interesting and suspect that the study of it is just in its infancy. We know that Gnosticism is similar in some respects to primitive Christianity and various eastern religions. Gnosticism is also different in many ways from the orthodox Christianity which ultimately gained the upper hand in the fourth century.It is hard to overestimate the significance of Gnosticism.For anyone wishing to explore this topic, I believe that THE NAG HAMMADI LIBRARY is a good place to start the journey.	2004-05-25

The authors point out that the healing of such memories can often also lead to physical healings.<br />The plan involves six steps which are gratitude for gifts, asking light for healing of root memories, sorrow for the harm done to Christ, forgiving like Christ, thanks for the growth from the hurt and seeing the new behavior Christ wants. The book includes exercises and reflections to help us practice the steps. It is suggested that we devote 15 minutes daily to this effort. The key is to stick to the daily discipline in order to receive the maximum benefit.	2004-05-09

In particular Garlow and Jones disagree with Brown's description of the attitude of early church leaders towards women, sex and the divinity of Jesus Christ and especially Brown's suggestion of a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene which produced offspring.<br />Garlow and Jones write in the style of two fundamentalists who feel threatened by a New Age heresy. They see a connection between the ideas expressed by THE DAVINCI CODE and the work of some of the scholars from The Jesus Seminar such as Elaine Pagels. Ultimately they predict the world will be divided into only two religious groups - pagan monism and biblical theism. The latter places God outside the circle of creation instead of in it as in pagan monism. In biblical theism God has a special place as creator apart from his creatures. In their view THE DAVINCI CODE preaches a form of pagan monism with God seen as an impersonal force of nature. Garlow and Jones stand firmly opposed to this view since they are on the side of the biblical theists.<br />I don't think that Dan Brown is motivated by much more than a strong desire to tell a good story and sell a lot of books. Garlow and Jones act more like they are on a crusade but they also want to sell books. I feel certain that more books on the subject of the DaVinci Code are definitely on the way.	2004-05-05

It is also a book about the spirit of flesh that is personofied by Jezebel and which threatens each of us individually as well as the larger church.<br />One of the more interesting sections of the book contains a description of the Jezebel personality which loves to control others and operates through manipulation, intimidation and domination. The Jezebel personality is often motivated by fear and insecurity. These negative traits are apt to be deeply entrenched making it difficult to conquer them without the aid of the Holy Spirit.<br />Sampson is more optimistic when he is talking about combatting the spirit of flesh in the broader sense. The author sees that God wants us to repent of self-centredness and become empty vessels relying solely on the Holy Spirit for guidance. God wants us to move to a higher place leaving behind weakness and defeat. On this hopeful note the book ends. Before you get to this point, however, you will probably gain a lot more respect for the destructive potential of the Jezebel spirit.	2004-04-30

The Jezebel spirit can exist in both men and women but seems to prefer to us feminine traits. It often operates in a person who wishes to dominate others because of insecurity or jealousy. The domineering wife is an example of Jezebel in action. Of course Jezebel cannot exist without an Ahab who is afraid to exercise his spiritual authority and put his house in order. The Jezebel spirit seeks to change women into men and make men into women.<br />Leadership positions in the church can be sought by women infected by the Jezebel spirit. The best way to prevent this situation from occurring is to be eternally vigilant. Each church needs to always have on hand a specially trained team to war against Jezebel. Frangipane reminds us that Jesus Himself has granted to us His authority to deal with the enemy and one section of the book describes in detail how we can wage corporate warfare against Satan's powers.	2004-04-27

The author explains that Christians have the power to gain freedom from these problems through their inheritance in Christ. It is up to them to exercise their authority and resist the devil. They are on the winning side in the war against Satan. Satan will try to get them to believe his lies and his biggest lie is that Christians are capable of being the God of their own lives. Satan will try to confuse them but in the end he can do nothing about their position in Christ.<br />Neil Anderson is a good writer and his book is filled with anecdotes which illustrate his ideas. The text ends with detailed instructions on how to break free from bondage and also how to help others to do the same thing.	2004-03-27

Most Catholics get a lot of exposure to the Bible through regular readings of scripture at every Mass - but many of us have little familiarity with the Bible as a whole. We absorb it only in fragments. This book will help us to acquire a more comprehensive view of the gospels.<br />A short section follows the main text in which general questions are answered about Christ and the beginnings of Christianity.

The three arenas are the mind, the church and the heavenly places. There are seven or eight chapters devoted to the techniques of spiritual warfare suitable for each separate battleground. The book is based on the belief that spiritual victory depends on both wisdom and virtue. It is suggested that the reader first become familiar with the terms described in the short glossary at the end of the publication.<br />The text is lean but loaded with useful insights and information.

You don't have to be an academic to understand it. The commentary is particulary good. The author highlights both the unique aspects of this gospel and also its similarities to the four canonical Gospels. Anyone interested in learning more about Mary Magdalene and the development of early Christianity will enjoy reading THE GOSPEL OF MARY MAGDALENE.	2004-03-09

The book is much more than a history of Satan. It is actually a story of the origins of Christianity told from the vantage point of how Satanic forces were described by different groups and succeeding generations of Christians.<br />In the beginning the enemies of the Christians are seen as other Jews such as the Pharisees. When the new movement fails to attract many Jewish converts, it instead starts to successfully recruit Gentiles. Now Satan is more likely to be seen at work orchestrating the Roman persecutions or instigating angry pagan mobs. Still later the enemy can be identified among groups of Christian heretics.<br />The author's strength and primary interest is the history of early Christianity. As usual her text is loaded with information on that subject. You may not agree with her conclusions but you will probably be impressed with the wealth of insights she gives to the reader on her favorite topic. Don't let the heavy-sounding title discourage you. Above all Elaine Pagels is an optimist and a message of hope can almost always be found in any of her books.	2004-03-05

In order to appreciate Jesus, Spong believes it is necassary to look at him through first century Hebrew eyes. From this vantage point the meaning of spiritual is to be alive to both God and the world. To have faith is to have the courage to enter life where one is also able to find God. To the Hebrew in the time of Jesus there is no separation between God and the world as there is in Greek philosophy.<br />The author shows us a few Hebrew images from the Bible to help us observe Jesus in this new light. They are Jesus as a new Moses and new Elijah as well as the suffering servant from Second Isaiah.<br />Spong also discusses certain words attributed to Jesus in the fourth gospel which allow us to see Jesus more completely. These words refer to Jesus as Light, Life, Resurrection and the Bread of Life. In this gospel Jesus is given what the author refers to as &quot;Christpower.&quot;<br />Spong provides a hopeful message for anyone who is having trouble relating to traditional Christianity but is still searching for meaning in religion. He writes with clarity and the text is filled with examples from his own personal quest for the truth.	2004-02-29

In her account attitudes toward marriage, family, procreation and celibacy are shown to vary widely.<br />The author portrays Jesus as a man who views himself as a prophet sent to warn mankind of the coming Kingdom of God. Preparation for this event, according to Jesus, will require an allegiance that is stronger even than one's ties to family and nation.<br />The message of Jesus and later Paul was mostly about repentance and purification. Pagels claims that this emphasis became modified as the religion spread to Rome, Greece, Asia and Africa. A struggle then ensued between orthodox believers who sought a new ethical system and institutional structure which set them apart from the neighboring pagans and the gnostics who wished to achieve an elevated level of spiritual consciousness without the supervision of bishops and clergy.<br />The author points out that the lessons of the creation stories as interpreted by the first Christians allow them to validate the freedom of humans to choose between good and evil. In the fifth century Augustine looks at Genesis more as a story of human bondage. While the earlier Christians see people as being capable of self government, the prevailing attitude among believers reverses itself abruptly after the time of Constantine.<br />Elaine Pagels writes with clarity and she has the ability to make difficult material seem understandable to those of us who are not academics.<br />In this book I learned more about the incredible assortment of beliefs prevalent within the early church. The vision of a simple and unified body of beginning Christians has always apparently been just a myth.	2004-02-24

Lake's ministry was a shining example of faith in action.<br />Lake's successful prescription for healing can be found in THE JOHN G. LAKE SERMONS. His habit of repeating the principles of his teaching makes the book fairly easy to understand. Lake continuously stresses that the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus can keep us free from disease. He considers Divine Healing to be a matter of faith and the Grace of God. The Spirit of God is as tangible as electricity and is available to all who accept Jesus Christ as personal lord and healer. It is more important to trust in God than it is to try to get a healing.<br />According to Lake, healings were numerous during the first four centuries of the church before the reign of Emperor Constantine. The gifts of the Holy Spirit were revived during the reformation because of Martin Luther's influence and his emphasis on faith.	2004-02-18

Specifically she explores the possibility of a marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene which produces a child after Mary Magdalene manages to escape to the southern coast of France. This legend leads to the Grail heresy which suggests that certain families in southern France can trace their ancestry back to Jesus and Mary Magdalene.<br />Starbird's book is a story about a heresy which keeps popping up throughout history in spite of the best efforts of the church to stamp it out - particularly during the inquisition. The author's reasoning is that if there is so much smoke then there must actually be a fire somewhere. Since the Grail heresy left an impressive legacy in art, song and folklore, Starbird is able to offer us numerous examples of the persistence of the heresy. She does this in great detail covering such subjects as the hidden meanings concealed in tarot cards and their connection to the Grail heresy.<br />Margaret Starbird is an enthusiastic writer who can tell a great story. She is not composing a work of scholarship but instead is investigating a mystery - the enigma of a legend which gets more intriguing with the passage of time and each new advance in the quest for the historical Jesus.	2004-02-11

In describing the effects of these gospels on the development of Christianity Elaine Pagels is able to make a complex subject seem quite understandable.<br />We always knew that the orthodox believers frequently denounced gnostic ideas. The discovery of the gnostic texts has revealed how gnosticism defended itself and in turn attacked orthodox beliefs.<br />The orthodox position was that the generations of Christians who lived after the time of the apostles could not possibly have the same access to Christ as the apostles did during Christ's lifetime on earth. Therefore these later Christians would have to look to the church and its bishops for teaching and leadership. The gnostic attitude was that access to God was available to any believer and some church elders themselves may not yet have had this same God experience. Many gnostics believed that all who had received this gnosis had transcended the authority of the church's hierarchy. People received gnosis when they came into contact with the living Christ.<br />In the orthodox view God was described as being definitely masculine while gnostics often referred to God in both masculine and feminine terms. The orthodox idea of God supported the custom of awarding the highest roles of church leadership to males.<br />Gnostics tended to make a distinction between mature believers who acquired the spiritual gifts of healing, prophecy and gnosis and those followers who did not yet have these attributes. The orthodox communities emphasized mostly the divide between clergy and laity.<br />Gnostic teaching put great stress on the discovery of the divine within oneself while the orthodox position stressed finding Jesus only through the church.<br />The main benefit I have received from reading THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS has been a greater appreciation of the early development of Christianity. I was able to see for the first time the other side of the story - a view of the contentious debate among early Christians from the losing side.<br />As for the winning side, it had never occurred to me before reading Pagels' book that the structure of the Roman Catholic church was based on an organizational model of the Roman army.	2004-02-06

If you plan to read the former I suggest you also look at the latter. Both books propose a theory which is quite complicated and based on much speculation. The theory is very interesting partly because it cuts a wide swath through many centuries of history and touches such diverse topics as the Prieure de Sion, Knights Templar, Louis XIV, House of Stuart, Rosslyn Chapel, Merovingians and Zealots.<br />HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL is written in the style of a conspiracy theory book and it is loaded with facts too numerous to check. It also makes numerous dubious assumptions. One is that Jesus Christ was highly literate and a member of the aristocracy. Another is that Jesus was married and a parent. Unfortunately there is no indisputable evidence to either support or disprove these suppositions.<br />In spite of the book's faults, I enjoyed reading it - even though 2000 years seems to be a long time to keep a secret.	2004-02-01

These groups are shown to be extremely diverse with a variety of ways open to prospective members wishing to be included. This is in sharp contrast to the requirements of Christian churches in the fourth century after the time of Constantine when Christians are required to profess strict creeds formulated by church leaders.<br />The Gospel of Thomas and more than fifty other ancient Christian texts were discovered at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt in 1945. As scholars examined these unique writings a new appreciation of the varied nature of early Christianity began to emerge.<br />The Gospel of Thomas encourages us to find out what is concealed within us instead of telling us exactly what to believe. The Jesus of the Gospel of John claims that He is the light. The Jesus of the Gospel of Thomas directs us to search inside ourselves for the light.<br />Ireneus, a church leader in Lyons in the late second century, was the champion of the theology  expressed in the Gospel of John. It was Ireneus who wielded more influence than any other Christian of his time over the formation of the canon which was finally accepted in the fourth century as representative of the othodox view.<br />Elaine Pagels writes with an optimistic tone similar to that found in many works by Marcus Borg. Pagels weaves her own personal testimony throughout the text of BEYOND BELIEF. Anyone who is on a journey of spiritual discovery will find much encouragement and inspiration from this book. Still others may find it to be the most interesting publication they have encountered in a long time.	2004-01-29

It is no longer possible for great numbers of the followers to believe for instance that the Bible or the creeds are literally or factually true. It is still possible, however, to find much that is true if one views them metaphorically.<br />Borg explains why he chooses to be a Christian and he makes several practical suggestions on such topics as worship and meditation based on a historical, metaphorical and sacramental approach to Christianity.<br />Although Borg reviews some material from his earlier works, his writing and insights remain fresh. His growth as a creative thinker seems to know few limits - particularly when he is writing about the value of Christian worship for him personally. Above all Borg is an inclusive Christian who appreciates the practices and beliefs of other religions in our increasingly  pluralistic society.<br />For me Borg is one of the most inspiring writers associated with the Jesus Seminar. This is especially true because of his ability to take the reader beyond the spiritually dry places one may find after deciding Christianity no longer makes much sense.	2004-01-19

He is murdered by a giant albino assassin who is seeking knowledge of an ancient secret which has been entrusted to Jacques and just three other men. The albino tells Jacques that the other three are already dead. Before Jacques dies he tries to leave enough clues near his body so that the secret can be passed on to the two people he trusts the most to guard it. One is agent  Sophie Neveu who is a cryptographer and also his granddaughter. The other is Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology at Harvard, who is presently staying at the Paris Ritz.<br />Langdon is called to the murder scene because his name is written on a message left by the murder victim. Sophie arrives soon after because the case requires a cryptographer. Sophie figures out that the message left by Jacques is meant for both her and Langford. She also knows that Langford is the chief suspect and he will shortly be put in jail. Since she needs his help in unraveling the clues left by Jacques, Sophie leads Langford out of the Louvre through an emergency exit. Together they set off to follow the clues and it soon becomes clear to them that their real quest is the Holy Grail.<br />There are others in pursuit of the same prize such as the famous British historian Sir Leigh Teabring as well as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa of the Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei.<br />THE DA VINCI CODE is in the best tradition of detective and thriller fiction.

Col. Patterson describes his experiences in the Clinton White House as one of the keepers of the little black bag known as the &quot;nuclear football.&quot;<br />He was stationed at the White House from 1996 until 1998.<br />Patterson portrays at least two instances when President Clinton shows a serious disregard for national security. One situation involves a missed opportunity to attack Osama Bin Laden because Clinton does not want to stop watching a golf tournament. Another time Clinton loses the nuclear codes which are never found.<br />Perhaps the most important revelation of the book concerns the entrenched anti-military attitude prevalent among Clinton, Gore and the entire White House staff. Some of the occasions reflecting this mood may seem merely childish such as requiring military aides to carry Clinton's golf clubs. The real problem is that the anti-military bias resulted in policies which have long-term consequences for our national security.<br />The legacy of the Clinton presidency described in DERELICTION OF DUTY demonstrates the widespread damage done to our military and intelligence capabilities during the eight irresponsible years of the Clinton-Gore reign. We need to be very thankful that Clinton is no longer our commander-in-chief.	2003-07-18

That belief seemed to be supported by our experiences with Communists in Korea, Cuba, Viet Nam and even Central America. After Reagan came to power we learned that the triumph of Communism was not necessarily inevitable. Reagan undertook several initiatives to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union. The most significant actions were the strengthening of our military and the start of a missile shield to protect America. He also decided to go on the offensive by funding anti-Communist rebels and invading Grenada. Congressional Democrats opposed all of these tactics.<br />Liberals have often been resisting  the war against Muslim extremists since it began in earnest with the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979.Liberal appeasers were admittedly quiet during the brief period of mourning after the brutal attack on U.S. soil on September 11, 2001. Recently, however, the opposition to the American war effort has been taken up again by liberals in full force.<br />In TREASON Ann Coulter supports the above arguments with much anecdotal evidence and numerous footnotes. Her writing style may not be to everyone's liking but nobody can say that she doesn't do her homework.	2003-07-15

He dies in a supposed drowning accident but his family and friends think he may have been murdered. Peter's older brother is a law student at Columbia University. With the encouragement of his friends he orchestrates a push for an investigation into Peter's death. It gets the attention of the media but soon it also becomes clear that wealthy interests in the town and the local police do not want the investigation to go any further. Jack's friends are being followed and intimidated. Then Jack learns some disturbing facts about Peter's recent past.<br />Peter had paid cash for his new car and left a bank balance of more than $187,000 to which Jack was the sole heir. Apparently Peter had been hired by the Newbauers to do more than park cars. <br />After Pauline Grabowski agrees to help Jack with his investigation, the truth starts coming out about Peter's murder. Pauline is a private investigator for the city's most prestitigious law firms but for once she decides to work on the side of the good guys. Jack is also aided by his octogenarian grandfather.<br />BEACH HOUSE is a story that moves fast. It helps that the authors have the knack of using short paragraphs and chapters. The book reads as if it is written according to a formula and the formula almost works well.	2003-07-08

The text of the book draws its material from an intensive seminar led by Campbell at Esalen in 1983.<br />The seminar lasted for one month and was attended by the editor, Diane K. Osbon, and nine other fortunate people.<br />In one memorable segment Campbell discusses the woman's life and her journey. The traditional role of the woman is in relationship in one way or another to a family. This role can continue into old age as in the example of the grandmother. Campbell contrasts the traditional female role to that of the female professors who are more on the male hero's journey deriving fulfillment from worldly achievements. Campbell sees these women as being less fulfilled than women who are also in nontraditional roles but are totally involved in the arts. The latter receive their fulfillment mostly from doing what the artist does and not so much from their accomplishments.<br />If you begin to read A JOSEPH CAMPBELL COMPANION, it will be a difficult volume to put back in the book case. It is more likely to remain close at hand to be read again and again.	2003-06-30

When the FBI tries to pressure Ford into helping them solve the case he resists as usual fearing that some of his past deeds as a secret government operative may come back to haunt him. Ford is able to put off the FBI but not Harrington, the girl's influential father, who knows too much about Doc's past and one particular operation known as Sky Hook. Harrington is seeking revenge against a ruthless killer named Edgar Cordero.<br />The attempted kidnapping is witnessed by a visiting Bahamian lady named Ransom who tells Ford she is the daughter of his late uncle Tucker Gatrell and a sizeable inheritance in stolen gold coins awaits both of them if they can decipher Tucker's complicated instructions. Doc's hippie friend Tomlinson assists in the hunt for the hidden treasure.<br />I agree with some of the reviewers who have expressed disappointment in SHARK RIVER. It does not strike me as being quite on a par with THE MANGROVE COAST and NORTH OF HAVANA or some of the other entries in the Doc Ford series. It is, however, still good enough, especially if you like Florida and you are a fan of John D. MacDonald or even Ross Thomas with his tales of foreign intrigue. Randy White's Doc Ford books remind me of certain elements I used to enjoy in stories by both MacDonald and Thomas although it does seem impossible to discover truly satisfying replacements for either one of these deceased authors.	2003-06-29

The similarities may not be easily recognized because the same motifs are usually understood and developed in different ways because of cultural differences. These repetitive motifs are called elementary ideas and in the local forms where they appear in various religions they are known as ethnic or folk ideas. As examples of elementary ideas Campbell offers the concepts of the Promised Land and the Virgin Birth. In writing about the similarities of symbols found in ancient civilizations, Campbell mentions discoveries among such diverse societies as those that existed in the Indus Valley, Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and Ireland.<br />Because of the great advances in learning which have become accelerated and dramatized by space exploration, Campbell points out that our old gods are either already dead or dying. The big question now is what new mythology will emerge from a modern understanding of a unified planet amidst a vast universe.<br />The creation of any new mythology will certainly depend in part on the contributions of art because artists will be the ones who will produce the images of the future. Those images will come from our knowledge of a constantly changing and expanding universe. Campbell writes about the connection between art and mythology with conviction, no doubt due to the long-standing influence of his wife, Jean Erdman, a well-known dancer and choreographer.<br />The most remarkable feature evident in THE INNER REACHES OF OUTER SPACE is the breadth and depth of the author's knowledge and understanding of mythology. Joseph Campbell led an enviable life driven by a singular passion and his writings are the best reflection of that life.	2003-06-03

He shows how the Jesus Christ of the Nicean Creed of the fourth century can be traced back to the humble Jewish sage of Nazareth and then retraced on a return trip to Nicea where he is resurrected after three centuries of promotion by his gentile admirers to full divinity as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. Funk also uses a good part of the book attempting to describe the historical Jesus using what the author considers to be the likely authentic words and deeds of the real Jesus.<br />Funk believes that public knowledge about the ancient gospels is woefully inadequate. Mainline churches do not address the questions people in the pews are asking about Jesus. Biblical scholars may know many of the answers to these questions but the scholars are only talking to each other. The aim of the quest of the historical Jesus is to liberate Jesus from this prison and especially from the captivity of the church creeds.<br />Christianity took its conclusive shape with the formation of church creeds and canons at church councils held in the fourth century C.E. Progress in this area was aided by the support and guidance of Roman Emperor Constantine.<br />World dominance of Christianity is at an end, according to Funk. It is not, however, the end of Christianity but actually a great opportunity to begin anew. Our understanding of the origins of the Christian religion is constantly changing. Funk believes a new perception of Jesus is possible if we place him back in his modest beginnings in Nazareth.<br />We have forgotten many things about Jesus that must have been obvious to his contenporaries, according to the author. For instance, Jesus was a social deviant who practiced an open table. He also criticized public displays of piety and certainly did not support the use of brokers in one's relationship to God.	2003-05-18

Brennan shows how dehumanizing language is used to devalue vulnerable populations such as the unborn and the elderly. The historical examples he offers are quite convincing as he traces the dehumanizing efforts made against women, European Jews, Soviet enemies, African Americans and Native Americans. Opponents of such groups often try to depict them as inanimate objects, waste products, nonpersons and even diseases.<br />Brennan makes his case with clarity.

Because of all that we have learned through science during the following seventeen centuries, many of the words of these antiquated creeds have become meaningless to us.<br />Countless Christians are now left without a supernatural parent figure in the sky able to intervene in their behalf. Some of these opt for the secular city while others try to carry on the struggle to maintain an increasingly weakened faith. It is the latter group in particular that Spong identifies as believers in exile whom he wishes to reach with a new message of hope.<br />Can Christianity survive without a theistic God and a theistic Jesus? Spong tries to answer this question by first examining some of the Christian images of Jesus. The favorite candidate for elimination by the author is that of Jesus as Redeemer. Since we are constantly evolving out of our more primitive past it does not make sense to assume that humans need to be rescued from a fall into sin from a previous state of perfection.<br />Spong does see Jesus, however, as a Spirit person and a God presence. There is a divine presence within all of us. Spong regards this presence as Spirit and believes that it was in Jesus in a most profound way. The author views God as a universal presence which undergirds all of life.<br />Spong looks upon himself as a believer who is now living in exile. When he dies he expects to enter into another existence. Meanwhile he wants to invite other believers in exile to explore with him new possibilities of Christian worship and faith.	2003-04-25

The author is interested in taking this discussion to the people in the church pews. His particular target seems to be the mainline liberal Christian churches whose membership is shrinking due to the apparent apathy of many of its adherents. For the people who are turned off by what they see as an irrelevant message Spong wants to rework the Christ story so that it makes sense in terms of this century. At the present time the Bible remains a prisoner of fundamentalist Christians.<br />Believing in the inerrancy of the Bible has always presented special problems according to Spong. For instance, Biblical writers did not possess any idea of the grand sweep of history. They also had no knowledge of distant lands, oceans or continents. In addition, they were very dependent on oral tradition.<br />The Bible does contain much truth and it is our challenge now to lift that truthfulness out of the confining structure of the ancient world.<br />Beneath the literalistic framework of the Bible lie some powerful messages. In the Old Testament stories of the prophets we can see attempts to remedy human problems of injustice and the later influence of the prophets on secular social reforms in Western countries. The gospels of the New Testament tell about the love of God visible in the life of Jesus who is able to break all human barriers of race, sex and nationality. The main message of Christ seems to be in fact all about destroying the barriers of our prejudices and becoming truly inclusive Christians.	2003-04-14

For example, early biblical history was much affected by Egyptian mythology and literature. Babylonian myths were sometimes added later and then integrated with other legends drawn from still more sources.<br />The author describes the Old Testament as a collection of myths. The myths are valuable because they lead us to learn the truth about the history of ancient Israel. Greenberg points out that by identifying the myths and legends which were used in writing the Bible we are able to determine where the Jewish people were located at definite dates in history. These myths and legends can sometimes even be offerred as proof of the validity of certain biblical events in the same manner as archaeological sites are utilized.<br />In discussing the myths individually the author has grouped them chronologically into three groups as follows: Myths of the Beginning, Myths of the Founders and Myths of the Heroes.<br />The book includes an extensive suggested reading list and a table of useful maps.	2003-03-20

Scott Hahn reminds us early in HAIL, HOLY QUEEN that according to the Second Vatican Council both Christ and Scripture were given to us by God for the sake of salvation. The author also agrees with Saint Augustine that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament which is in turn revealed in the New Testament. For instance there are many parallels which can be drawn between Genesis and the Gospel of John.<br />Hahn shows us one way to look at Scripture is as the story of God's preparation for and completion of His self-revelation in Jesus Christ.

A NEW CHRISTIANITY FOR A NEW WORLD represents the latest stage in the author's rapidly evolving vision of the future of Christianity. Spong begins by stating that theism is dead. God is not a supernatural being who can or does periodically intervene in the world. Our modern view of the natural order suggests that this is not possible.<br />Spong explains that theism was born in the beginning of civilization when people first experienced feeling unsafe and alone. Theism developed as a coping mechanism against trauma.<br />The author asserts that the theistic interpretation of Jesus was only added in the later Christian writings. Spong does not believe in much of the traditional Christian story. He does not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus or the idea that Jesus founded either a church or its sacraments. He says he does not have a problem with the faith - only with the literal way it is interpreted and described by some others.<br />Spong perceives a need for a new faith that is not subject to the death of theism. God is real even though theism is dead. Can Christianity still live after theism is dead? It will, according to the author, if we are willing to move beyond our traditional ideas of Jesus.<br />Spong sees God as the source of all life, love and being. He views the church of the future as a place where worshipers will still seek the Holy and the Realm of God. They will search for an environment which allows them to increase their capabilities to love and embrace life to the fullest.<br />God is real and Jesus is the doorway into this reality. Spong still considers himself to be a Christian and remains optimistic about the future. He is not sure where his new reformation will ultimately lead us but he is convinced we have to take the first step. If we do nothing, Spong believes that Christianity will surely die anyway.	2003-02-02

The team she leads will impersonate a crew of cleaning ladies in order to gain access to the building.<br />It is possible to view the story as being about a duel between the strong-willed Felicity and a cruel, fanatical German Army officer named Major Dieter Franck. Even though we know the British wonder woman will probably defeat the German superman, there is still enough suspense to keep us interested until the outcome is certain.<br />Follett is a trained journalist who is an excellent writer. He is also a skilled storyteller and he seems to be at his best when spinning yarns about World War II.<br />The book was supposedly inspired by the example of Pearl Witherington, a British courier who was recommended for a Military Cross for her wartime exploits.	2003-01-04

It is most obviously an expose of the workings of the Office of Independent Counsel during the Clinton years. We learn about the horrors of the politics of personal destruction and such related issues as the need to read all newspapers with a large amount of skepticism.<br />John Wilkes is a pseudonym used by Stephen Smith. The author possesses a broad background in politics, academia and the law. As a result, he is able to shower the reader with original insights into a wide variety of people, events and situations.<br />If the reader looks carefully THE STAR CHAMBER can also be read as a love story and partly because of this the book often manages to maintain an optimistic tone.	2002-12-07

It is also a stirring tale of romance in which love conquers evil and despair.<br />The plot is interesting while the main characters are multi-dimensional and very intriguing. The book has almost too many characters but some are memorable simply because they seem so real.<br />The story begins with Jane Eyre as an unwanted orphan in the care of a cruel aunt who has two spoiled children of her own. Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.<br />I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847.	2002-11-20

As Santiago continues to fish alone, Manolin cares for Santiago by taking food to him at the end of each day.<br />On the eighty-fifth day Santiago hooks the big marlin. He lets the fish pull him out of sight of land during an epic struggle which lasts for three days. Santiago eventually loses most of the marlin to attacking sharks. He returns to his village with only the skeleton and the head of the fish attached to his small boat.<br />THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a book which can be read and read again later in life with new insights. There is much to see in Santiago's battle with the fish and also in his mentoring relationship with Manolin.<br />One of the biggest pleasures for me in reading this book is in the enjoyment I receive from savoring the unique writing style of Hemingway. It is heavily influenced by his early journalistic training.<br />The novel is very short but deserves without a doubt to be considered an American classic.	2002-11-01

It is a very long book which contains almost too much incidental information about whales but it is fully redeemed by its intriguing characters and realistic descriptions of whalers in action.<br />The two main characters are Captain Ahab of the Pequod and Ishmael who is the narrator of the story. Ahab is obsessed by a desire to hunt down the giant whale Moby Dick which cost him his leg during an earlier voyage. Ishmael is an experienced young seaman who is new to whaling. The tale focuses on the Pequod's long hunt for the huge sperm whale.<br />Melville is an elegant writer. I recommend MOBY DICK mostly for that reason. The book has so many strengths that the lengthy treatises on whales and whaling are really a small price to pay for such a worthwhile reading experience.	2002-10-23

He divides his subject into five sections beginning with a discussion of various reasons to pray such as prayer produces power, prayer brings health and prayer opens the door for the Holy Spirit. In Part II Dr. Cho describes the three types of prayer which are petition, devotion and intercession. In the next section he explains the forms of prayer including fasting and prayer  and waiting on the Lord. Then Dr. Cho discusses praying in the Holy Spirit and other methods of prayer. The final section is devoted to the subject of powerful prayer based on the blood covenant of Jesus Christ.<br />Dr. Cho founded the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul in 1958. It has become the largest congregation in the world with more than 700,000 members. The church was built on prayer and has continued to thrive as a shining example of the power of prayer.<br />The Yoido Full Gospel Church is probably most famous for its Prayer Mountain which provides a secluded place of prayer for those desiring to be alone with God.	2002-10-15

It is instead a long harangue about how the liberals and the media they control attack conservative politicians and their ideas. Naturally a few issues do get mentioned in the process.<br />Coulter is at her best in the concluding chapter where she cites such conservative public policy ideas as Privatizing Social Security, the Strategic Defense Initiative, Pollution Tax Credits, Welfare Reform and the Flat Tax. Throughout the book she also frequently gives credit to Reagan for ending the Cold War.<br />SLANDER may serve a purpose in reminding conservatives that they have a tough opponent in the media. However, the book is very repetitious and Coulter's writing style can get wearisome.	2002-10-13

He pulls no punches when he cites for instance that Peter was never Bishop of Rome because the early Christians used a congregational style of governance. Cahill goes on to describe the evolution of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome which gains momentum after the Council at Nicea in 325 and is aided by the support of Emperor Constantine who wishes to use Christianity to better unite his empire. The leadership of the Bishop of Rome is never really accepted by the churches of the East and ultimately is challenged in the West as well by Martin Luther and the Reformation of the sixteenth century. Cahill describes the ups and downs of the papacy and by the time he reaches the 20th century the reader has a better appreciation for the tensions which exist between the churches of the East and West in addition to the reasons for the Reformation and the competing claims of Roman Catholic apologists. In short, we begin to understand the challenges facing John XIII when he becomes pope.<br />The author clearly likes John XXIII who was born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli into a large family of tenant farmers near the small city of Bergamo.<br />Angelo went to the seminary early but also was drafted into the military for a brief period. After ordination as a priest he seemed to rise rapidly as he was singled out for diplomatic assignments to Bulgaria, Turkey and France.<br />Cahill points out that some of the friends Angelo made along the way helped him develop the progressive streak which inspired him to convene Vatican II. The list of these friends includes the historian Bernard Berenson and the composer Igor Stravinsky.<br />Angelo was elected pope because the cardinals wanted a compromise candidate who would not last too long and one who would bridge the gap between all levels of society. At that time Angelo was the Patriarch of Venice. The other candidate was Cardinal Gregory Agagianian, Patriarch of the Armenian Uniates. Agagianian was backed by the conservatives. Angelo eventually won after several rounds of voting.<br />The crowning achievement of his papacy is obviously Vatican II. The most interesting part of the book is the account of the battle before and during the council by the conservative forces led by Ottaviano and their progressive opponents.<br />The legacy of Vatican II was later preserved by Paul VI, a staunch friend of and successor to John XXIII.<br />Cahill is definitely a liberal who ends the book expressing some doubt about the contributions of John Paul II but holding out considerable hope for the future of the Roman Catholic Church.	2002-10-09

As such it presents a broad sampling of Campbell's work on mythology and the Western religions.<br />Campbell believes that the stories in the Bible should be read metaphorically. By interpreting events historically institutional religions create a problem. When people realize that the events probably did not take place, then the power of the message is diminished. Examples of such events are the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and the Exodus from Egypt.<br />A fairly thorough discussion is introduced in Chapter VI  of Judo-Christian symbols such as the Virgin Birth, Judas and the Flight into Egypt. Here we see why Campbell is so much admired for the breadth of his knowledge of mythology and his ability to bring this learning to bear on Jewish and Christian origins.<br />In one of the more interesting parts of the book Campbell describes the basic differences between the world religions of creed which are Buddhism, Christianity and Islam and the leading ethnic religions of birth which are Hinduism, Judaism and Shintoism.<br />Often Campbell points out that our ideas of the universe are being reordered by our experience in space. There are no horizons in space causing many people to retreat into fundamentalism.<br />For a small book THOU ART THAT is filled with much food for thought. I highly recommend it and am looking forward to reading future volumes in this series.	2002-09-17

The seaworthiness of the latter had already been proven on the Kon-Tiki expedition in 1952.<br />On the Easter Island expedition Heyerdahl and his 22 companions discovered that the island had once been wooded before the first inhabitants deforested it. Furthermore, according to carbon dating, these earliest settlers had apparently arrived about 380 A.D. which was much earlier than previously assumed by other archaeologists. Interviews with some Easter Islanders suggested that the island's oral tradition contained stories of migration from places to the East. Of course the biggest mystery of Easter Island was the origin of the huge statues of long-eared men.<br />AKU-AKU was a great adventure story and to me the most inspiring aspect of it was Heyerdahl himself. He has set the standard for sticking by his convictions against all odds from his original expedition to Polynesia with his young bride in 1937 to his death on April 18, 2002. Heyerdahl at the very least has injected much life into a stodgy academic discipline.<br />The natives of Easter Island by the way are called Rapanui and today a total of about 2000 Rapanui still live on the island while many others have emigrated to mostly Chile , Tahiti and North America.	2002-08-25

Much of the book is devoted to the politics within the university community among the coaches, administrators and influential alumni. It is also a story about the rise of Notre Dame football during a period when Catholics were striving for more influence politically and more acceptance in general in the United States.<br />The author makes much use of the private correspondence of Knute Rockne and paints a very unromantic picture of the great coach and some of his star players. Based on this book Lee Marvin or Robert Mitchum instead of Ronald Reagan are the best choices to play the part of George Gipp in a movie.<br />SHAKE DOWN THE THUNDER is more of a cultural history than a football story. It contains very little football action. The book is well-researched and shows how both the urge to overemphasize college football and the resulting forces trying to contain it have been in existence for a long time.	2002-08-23

For former students the pertinent parts may serve as a mostly boring trip down memory lane. For the real insiders such as professors or administrators or influential alumni it may prove to be more exciting.<br />After finally finishing the book I can only conclude that a story about Harvard or maybe any academic institution is apt to be uninteresting.

Since it was Morison's own idea, the credit must surely go to him as well as to FDR. The visit between Roosevelt and Morison which set the stage for Morison's role as the official WWII naval historian was probably not so much a meeting between a lofty president and a lowly Harvard professor as it was a friendly get-together between two fellow preppies and Harvard grads of approximately the same age. I have assumed that this bond did not unduly influence Morison's evaluation of FDR's performance as Commander-In-Chief.<br />The introduction to THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC 1939-1943 gives a good account of the state of U.S. Navy preparedness between the two World Wars. The appencices help the reader to appreciate the relative strength of the combatants. It is important to realize that the Navy was already making its weight felt in various parts of the world before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The United States Navy was forced into this situation by the rapidly evolving predicament of Great Britain and her allies. The Nazis had overrun Greece and Crete and had put Russia deep in a hole. It appeared possible that Germany and Italy would soon control all three entrances of the Mediterranean - The Straits, The Dardanelles and the Suez Canal. Much of this book describes in great detail how the tide of war turned from this low beginning to a much brighter picture for the Allies by April 1943. By then Germany had lost the strategic initiative when it failed to capture Stalingrad. The German Black Sea Fleet was fighting a losing battle and Germany was forced to evacuate its remaining troops from North Africa. In addition, the Allies were organizing an invasion of the European Continent while Japan was on the defensive in the Pacific.<br />The story is a wide-ranging one because the area involved in the Battle of the Atlantic is so vast. At one end we have the supply run to North Russia to give that beleagured country the essential means to continue to fight. At the other end there is the important contribution of Brazil to the ultimate victory by the Allies. In between there is the very dangerous threat of the German submarine offensive and our paralyzingly slow response to it. The tragedy of our substantial merchant marine losses in the early part of hostilities is described in some detail by Morison but the explanation of exactly how this situation developed is one of the more disappointing aspects of the book. The responsibility for the calamity is still being debated and explored. Morison does not go much below the surface in his account of this sordid affair although the author is not necessarily an unqualified fan of Admiral Ernest J. King.<br />THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC 1939-1943 is a very detailed historical record in spite of the book's few shortcomings. My respect for Samuel Eliot Morison is increased by reading it and I highly recommend the volume to anyone interested in the history of WWII.	2002-08-19

He invited His followers into a transformational relationship with the same Spirit that He Himself knew. Jesus encouraged people to join Him in a community whose core value was compassion. He wanted to move people from living in a world of conventional wisdom to a world centered in God.<br />Furthermore, Borg does not regard Jesus as uniquely and exclusively the true revelation of God - but only as a unique revelation of God.<br />What sets Borg apart from most other Jesus Seminar scholars is his emphasis on the Christian life as a journey towards a deepening and transforming relationship with God. Believing in Jesus does not mean believing things about Jesus. It is not about believing what the Gospels and the church say about Jesus. It means instead to give one's heart at its deepest level to the Post-Easter Jesus who is the Living Lord and also the Spirit.	2002-08-16

After death we might be with Him if we were good on earth and believed the right things.<br />Instead of believing in a supernatural being out there, Borg suggests we will find it more satisfying to be in relationship with a sacred reality right here. God is not the sum total of things. God is more than everything. He is all around us and within us and we are within God.<br />The Christian life is not about beliefs and requirements. It is not about believing in a God out there for the sake of an afterlife later. The Christian life is about entering into a relationship with God as known in Jesus Christ. This is the God who is out there but also right here. This God is real and is the God we never knew. A relationship with this God will prove to be a life-changing experience.<br />Borg shows how this God has really been in the Bible all along but has been largely ignored by mainline Christianity. For anyone struggling with Christian beliefs, THE GOD WE NEVER KNEW may well lead to the start of an unforgettable journey with the sacred.	2002-07-30

His descriptions of his parents, boyhood teachers and youthful life in an Ireland recently freed from its colonial past are fairly interesting but too superficial. More intriguing are those parts of the book which deal with his profound anger directed at the church hierarchy and the chapter which describes the evolution of his early research on the sayings and parables of Jesus into a wider quest focusing on the life of Jesus.	2002-06-27

In order to fully appreciate the depth and seriousness of the effort it is essential to gain a good understanding of the authors' methods of research as described in the book's Introduction.<br />The most important thing I am learning from Crossan and Reed is that there is much more left to be uncovered about the historical Jesus. What I see in Crossan and Reed's studies are the possibilities for further explorations. However, I am sure they will be the first to admit that their approach may be refined in the future as more progress is made in archaeological finds and textual exegesis.<br />Crossan and Reed emphasize the itinerancy and commensality of the earliest Christians. Their theories are based on the existence of the Q Gospel and the independence of the Gospel of Thomas. In the future both of these assumptions may  be altered due to additional discoveries. Meanwhile their greatest contribution may be simply in showing us the possibilities that lie in relentlessly digging for the truth.	2002-06-16

Its greatest strength lies in the clarity of the text which may be due mostly to the collaboration of Richard G. Watts. The format is helpful as the book is divided into nine chapters organized around such topics as the miracles attributed to Jesus and the events on Easter Sunday. Within each chapter the authors attempt to answer specific questions. Jesus is described as an eloquent but illiterate peasant who lives in an occupied land. He offers an alternative vision of a community of equals before God and each other. Free healing and shared eating are the hallmarks of the new society. Jesus invites women, children, lepers and the destitute to join him in this experiment and then to take the message to others in an effort to create a Kingdom of God here and now on this earth.<br />Jesus was executed brutally by the Romans but his power was still experienced by his followers after his death. The Kingdom of God of Jesus did not act as broker between its believers and God. Jesus prevented that from happening by keeping himself constantly on the move and sending forth his followers only as itinerant missionaries. Such an organizational structure or lack of structure contrasted sharply with the design of the rival contemporary factions within Judaism as well as the Christian religion which evolved later from the Jesus movement. <br />The reader may find some of Crossan's theories farfetched but nobody can fault him for not being original in his thinking.	2002-05-27

Chief Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard investigates the crime.<br />Duff learns that the victim was a member of the Lofton Round The World Tour. The only clues are a hearing aid, a safe deposit box key and a bag full of small stones. All of the members of the tour are suspects including Dr. Lofton, Max Minchin, Captain Ronald Keane and John Ross. Lofton is the director of the tour. Minchin is a racketeer from Chicago. Keane is an unemployed engineer and Ross is a lumber man from Tacoma.<br />As the tour continues, Walter Honeywood and his wife Sybil are killed in Nice. Sergeant Welby of Scotland Yard is accompanying the tour and continuing the investigation. He is murdered on the docks of Yokohama. Chief Inspector Duff travels to Honolulu to join the tour. While visiting Charlie Chan, Duff is shot in the back and hospitalized. Charlie gets permission to fill in for his friend on the final leg of the trip to San Francisco.

Borg theorizes that Jesus was deeply involved with the sociopolitical life of His own people as the founder of a revitalization movement. The Jesus movement is depicted as seeking to transform Jewish society by creating an alternative community based on inclusiveness, acceptance, love and peace. The Jewish social world in contrast is dominated by the politics of holiness which emphasizes separation as typified by clean and unclean, purity and defilement, sacred and profane, Jew and Gentile, righteous and sinner. Further complicating the situation is the Roman annexation of Palestine in 63 B.C. which creates an onerous system of double taxation with disastrous consequences for the agrarian society into which Jesus is born. The Jesus movement has competition from other Jewish renewal movements in Palestine such as the Essenes, Pharisees and Zealots.

By faith Glennon means a belief that God's promises are received with a resulting healing and that no lingering doubt about it is retained.<BR>Glennon's style is not flashy and the tone of his book will be welcomed by those who are repelled by the overly dramatic antics of some Christian healers seen on television.	2001-09-07

The weakest part of the book is the coverage given to the side effects of radiation treatment. Wallner clearly understates this important consequence. Another shortfall is that not enough space is given to a comparison of the disease-free suvival statistics between surgery and radiation.

He somehow escaped from Germany during the war and ended up in Thailand where he acquired a Thai bride named Tao Muong. Later they were both admitted to the United States and given U.S. citizenship. Recently Bracht had been working in Cape Carnaveral as head of the top-secret Project Galaxy. Tao Muong disappeared suddenly and was believed to have gone to Thailand. When Dr. Bracht insisted on pursuing her alone, Colonel North was assigned to follow him and make sure he did not fall into Russian hands before returning to the United States.<br />After arriving in Bangkok, Bracht heads for the Imperial Hotel. North will try to stay in a nearby room. The hotel is the temporary headquarters for an American  movie company which is shooting a film in Thailand. Even before North and Bracht reach the hotel, someone tries to kill them as they share a cab from the airport. North has to figure out fast who the Russian agents are among the hotel guests. There are several people with the movie company who may have Communist backgrounds. North is also interested in Chu Hoong who is a multi-millionaire manufacturer of a potent drink called Dragon's Tooth Elixir and also the owner of the Imperial Hotel.<br />North as usual is pursued by beautiful women and is invariably interrupted during any promising romantic interludes by circumstances beyond his control. Often the interruption comes in the form of the delivery of an urgent message.<br />The story reflects the growing ties between North Vietnam and Russia and the tensions existing in the region after France's defeat in Indochina in 1954 and before the resumption of hostilities in Vietnam in the early 1960's.	2001-03-13

He quickly learns that there are several operatives seeking the formula. There is also a rival airline, Air Oriental, which is planning a Pacific route and will want to have the advantages of the new fuel. Air Oriental is registered as a Chinese corporation but uses German pilots and equipment.<br />Sam Patterson, the chief engineering officer of Trans-Pacific, is murdered. The company's safe is broken into and the formula is stolen. North believes that the murder of Patterson and the theft of the formula are connected. The murder scene reveals several clues including the victim's double-breasted coat which was buttoned on the wrong side and a glass water pitcher containing a woman's flesh-tinted stocking. The leading suspects are Patterson's former and current girl friends. Also under suspicion are the new operations manager of Trans-Pacific and the Macao manager of Air Oriental. In addition, North must consider Mr. Tashima, previously a lieutenant in the Japanese Navy but now in the postal service and Alexis Lebov, a professed White Russian who is thought to actually be working for the NKVD.

A pearldiver named George Lee is dying from a wound inflicted by an unidentified American soldier. The murderer is probably from Fort Winfield on the nearby island of Sanga Sanga. Before dying Lee tells North about some lost pearls.<br />As an officer of the Department of Criminal Investigation, North proceeds to Fort Winfield to find the killer. Based on a description of the murderer given by witnesses, Private Paul Laval is identified by the post's commanding officer as the leading suspect. Laval claims self defense but is locked up in the fort jail.He later escapes and shortly thereafter Lt. Patrick Keene is found murdered. The killings seem to be tied to a valuable collection of pearls lost with the recent sinking of the junk Chu Shan.<br />This is not a spy story. It is a story about an investigation of a series of murders. In fact, North is sometimes referred to in the novel as a detective. The author gives the strong impression that he is very familiar with the Philippines and the Sulu Sea. This review refers to the original edition of THE SULU SEA MURDERS published in 1933.	2001-01-30

Above all, Morse has an open mind. The reader will do well to approach the book with the same. There is much to be found here which may affirm one's beliefs.

His mission is to defeat attempts by Russia and China to gain influence in the tiny territory and control over its strategic location.<br />North's chief allies are Ad Delahanty and Subnadar Thopa. Delahanty is a former United States Army Sergeant who was dishonorably discharged for desertion. He is currently the owner of a business which outfits hunting and mountaineering expeditions. Thopa is a Ghurka mountain guide whose skills are indispensable during North's long trek overland to Jonkhar.<br />The opposition includes Russian and Chinese agents who are also competing against each other.<br />Members of the Jonkhar Royal Family have their own personal agendas based mostly on the struggle for succession to the throne of the Sri Rajah.<br />The one loose canon in the whole mix is Baroness Atossa Frederika Matala. Although she is an Estonian and allied with the Russians, the Baroness is also a very liberated lady who is quite capable of making her own deals.<br />The novel is crowded with too many unconvincing characters with competing schemes. Colonel North's mission is unnecessarily  vague. He operates best when facing a specific challenge such as the search for a secret enemy chemical formula in TWO TICKETS FOR TANGIER.<br />The book's greatest strength lies in its  authentic description of mountain travel by pony and on foot.	2001-01-23

The agent is really Master Sergeant Willie Bonhart who defected from the army to East Berlin several years ago, posing as a disgruntled soldier. As a Black and a warrior, he is a useful symbol for the Russians as they strive to gain influence  in Zanzibar and nearby territories that are seeking independence.<br />North and Trotter go to Africa disguised as employees of a spice company. At their first stop in Nairobi they soon learn that the East African Liberation Party is also very interested in Willie Bonhart. The leader of the Party is James Mnoyah who used to be a Mau Mau operative. Both Bonhart and Mnoyah have a potential enemy in Tommy Henderson, a White settler who lost his wife and children to Mau Mau terrorists. All of these forces have to be taken into account as North and Trotter proceed to Zanzibar and attempt to free Bonhart from the KGB officers who are holding him hostage before his appearance at a mass rally for African independence.<br />This is very much a Cold War spy story with lots of background information provided on East African politics. Much is made of the murder in 1961 of Patrice Lumumba and Russia's involvement at that time in the former Belgian Congo.<br />The use of coded messages is a key ingredient in the success of North's mission.	2001-01-21

Captain Hugh North of G-2 Army Intelligence is assisting Major Bruce Kilgour, a British agent, on a case involving a series of murders in Cairo. The killer leaves a red-and-black female garter fastened about the left arm of each victim. The murders are somehow linked with the recent supplying of Arab tribes with modern weapons. Trouble is now brewing in Palestine. England does not like this situation and France does not like it either because of Palestine's proximity to Syria.<br />Solution of the crimes is aided by the ability of North and his allies to decode messages.

THE BIBLE THROUGH THE AGES is much more interesting. It is a topical tour of the Bible arranged around five themes: the Oral Tradition, the writing of the Old Testament, the writing of the New Testament, the copying of the Bible by monks in the Middle Ages and the distribution of the Bible after the invention of the printing press. One topic I find to be particularly interesting is the discussion of the debate over the canonicity of Christian writings during the first three centuries after Christ. A related topic covers certain  writings left out of the New Testament. THE BIBLE THROUGH THE AGES is a thick book and it is richly illustrated. Although it is not exactly a reference book, it contains much information not available elsewhere.	2001-01-06

THE VESPER SERVICE MURDERS is only the second of the author's twenty-six books featuring Hugh North. Captain North is invited to participate in the investigation of a series of murders in the city of Deptford, Massachusetts. Dr. Walter Allan, a friend of North, is used as a narrator by Mason. North is already famous because of newspaper publicity about previous cases he has solved dating back to World War I army service in Europe. Knowledge of American Morse code is employed by North as a tool of detection in this case. The novel is written in the style of a police detective story and it shows the promise realized in the later entries in this series which deal entirely with espionage and international intrigue.<br />In THE YELLOW ARROW MURDERS Hugh North is actually working as an agent of G-2 of the United States Army on a case in a foreign country. He is sent to Cuba to either buy or steal plans for an advanced torpedo which are being sold by its inventor in Cienfuegos. The seller of the plans calls himself Alvarado but his real name is Doelger. He is a disgruntled American who was discharged from the U.S. Navy for dereliction of duty in 1918. When North arrives in Cienfuegos, he finds plenty of competitors already there seeking the prize. Some are agents of their governments while others are merely adventurers in the game for profit. In one role or another there are representatives from England, France, Japan, Germany, Russia, Portugal and Italy. This is the first novel in the series in which North operates in a foreign country under orders from G-2 on a matter of international intrigue.<br />In THE BRANDED SPY MURDERS Captain Hugh North is sent to Honolulu. His mission is primarily to prevent a war from breaking out between Japan and the United States. A Japanese naval squadron is headed towards Honolulu with unknown intent. North attends a party at the home of Abner Polk, owner of a big American steelcompany. The other guests at the party include intelligence operatives from Russia, France, England and Japan as well as steel barons from France and Germany. All have an interest in either starting or preventing the war. Before the evening is over a dead female is found floating near Polk's dock. She has a strange design on her shoulder. Perhaps it is a tattoo that has been erased. Who is the dead girl and how does her death fit into a plot to start a war? The toughest obstacle North faces in this adventure is his attraction to Nadia Stefan, a beguiling Russian agent. Considering the fact that the story was written in 1932, the near attack by Japanese naval ships on Honolulu shows the author to be gifted with uncanny foresight.	2001-01-05

It was  written during a period when Spenser was heavily involved with Susan Silverman and, in this book, distracted by her absence. Spencer seems to stagger through the story while Hawk is always there to save him. Hawk is mentally and physically one step ahead of Spenser on this case. Judged as a whole, I found this to be one of Parker's best novels.	2000-12-05
