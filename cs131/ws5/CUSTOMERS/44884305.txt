I prefer his early work, \\"Strangers\\", \\"Lightning\\", \\"Night Chills\\" etc. but I still enjoy the novels he puts out today. \\"The Taking\\" was pretty good, it's not on the level of say \\"Watchers\\", but it was much better than some of the novels of recent years. What I have always liked about Dean Koontz is his ability to create great, memorable and sympathetic characters, and \\"The Taking\\" is no exception. And though the cast is much smaller in this novel, you really feel for this group of folks who are put in such an awful situation. The terrifying world Koontz creates with \\"The Taking\\" is fantastic, this is the stuff the made me a fan of his in the first place. This book will keep you guessing, and turning pages for sure. It's also an easy read. I finished it in just over 3 days reading on my lunch break.  Please notice I am being vague in my reveiw for a purpose. I hate reading a review that is full of spoilers, and there are quite a few posted here that are more than willing to spill out this novel's secrets. If you are a fan of Koontz, you will most likely enjoy this novel, if you haven't read Koontz, this is a decent introduction to a great author.	2005-09-28

I like the way Rollins creates his characters, and he has a great way of injecting them with the right touch of personality to make them endearing. And though most of Rollins' stories are grounded in science (beliveable or not is up to the individual reader) he doesn't get as technical as Michael Crichton or Ken Follett, which allows the reader to stay glued to the story. \\"Deep Fathom\\" was the perfect choice to take to the beach with me this summer, and made for a great summer read. The story isn't heavy, the characters and situations they are put in are fun to read about, and there is an abundence of action that really keeps you turning the pages. Think of \\"Deep Fathom\\" as you would one those special effects heavy summer blockbuster movies, lots of fun while there, but forgotten about almost as soon as it's over.	2005-09-20

I am shocked at some of the mixed reviews posted below??! I found \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" to be one of the best novels of the series so far, ranking right up there with \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" as not only a great \\"Harry Potter\\" book, but as a great book...period. The character development, the action, the back story of a \\"certain\\" character are fantastic. Rowling has really outdone herself when it comes to writing scenery and setting. The entire \\"lake of the dead\\" scene was extremely well written, and the tension buidling up throughout this novel was wonderfully handled. This novel contains everything fans of the series have come to expect, wonderfully imaginative, while at the same time easy to relate to. If you are are curious about all of the attention this series is garnering world-wide, but have yet to crack open one of these books, do yourself a favor and dive in right away. Of course, don't start you journey here, pick up the story with the first book, even if you have seen the films that have been done so far, read the books, there is so much more to each book that just doesn't make it into the finished films. \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" deserves they hype it is getting, as does the entire series so far.	2005-08-01

I have heard of Michael Connelly, but had never read any of his novels until \\"The Poet\\" was given to me by a friend. This is one of the best thrillers I have read since \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". I was completely sucked into the world of the poet, and couldn't turn the pages quickly enough. I hated to see the book drawing to a close, but I also could not wait to see where the story would take me. Connelly's writing is fantastic, and really captures the mood of the story. I found his description to people and places similar to the writing of James Lee Burke, who is also a master of this genre. This is a great introduction to Connelly's writing, and I plan on following up my reading of \\"The Poet\\" with it's sequel \\"The Narrows\\". Highly recommended for fans of great police thrillers!!	2005-07-19

Book for old WCW Fans	I am a steady visitor to Reynold's Wrestlecrap.com website, and really enjoyed \\"Wrestlecrap\\" the novel. I was looking forward to reading \\"Death of WCW\\" to get a few laughs at the stupid booking ideas, and to remember some of the goofy things that used to happen on \\"Thunder\\". About halfway through the novel I realized....I wasn't laughing, in fact I was getting angry and depressed at the same time. I have quite a few fond memories of watching WCW, and just reading about all of the talent WCW had, all of the money made available to the promotion...it just kind of hit me how badly the entire promotion was run. Eric Bischoff and company had all of the means necessary to become THE Premier wrestling company in the US....and just blew it! As a fan who lived through the \\"Monday Night Wars\\" this was a great book, that brought back so many memories, and if you were a fan of WCW or WWF/E at that time you should definately read this book. It's amazing how inept WCW became...and what's really amazing is watching the current WWE making so many of the same mistakes that are outlined in this book??!!	2005-07-19

I have to say that I enjoyed Fate's story almost as much as Death's story \\"On a Pale Horse\\". \\"Skein\\" is packed with great characters that you really cheer for. I don't even want to give away a hint of the story, but I felt that \\"Skein\\"'s plot has been the best of the series so far, and really makes you want to read the next book of the series. Anthony's unique writing style is so much fun. And the story of Fate is just so imaginative and engrossing you won't be able to put this book down once started. With Summer almost upon us, I would highly recommend you throw a copy of \\"Tangles Skein\\" into your beach-bag with you tanning lotion, as this almost a perfect summer read.	2005-05-19

I didn't really care for this novel. I read it when it first came out, and didn't really like it then, and I just finished re-reading it today, and still don't care for it. I guess my biggest problem with \\"Gerald's Game\\" is that it reminds me of a \\"Lifetime\\" network movie, where all the men in the novel are presented in an evil light, and it's up to the women to use their common sense to overcome the problems created by the men. And the messages that are presented in the book, the ills of child abuse, spousal abuse etc. are delivered with a sledgehammer. There is nothing subtle about King's messages in the book, you are pounded over the head with them, page after page, until you feel as drained as the heroine in the story. And to make matters worse, once the main story is over, you have to still get through what may be the longest epilogue ever written. The last 60 pages or so of the novel, focus solely, on what up to that point, had been a side story. A story that if presented earlier may have helped the novel along, but all lumped together at the end of the book as it is, just makes the story drag on and on. Don't let this book be your introduction to Stephen King's writing, and unless you are a completist who feels compelled to read everything by the author, I would pass this one over.....re-read \\"The Shining\\" instead.	2005-05-13
US	44884305	R1UODH9OA70DSZ	0525948430	518961183	Whiteout	Books	2	1	1	N	N	A Below Par Offering	Usually when I read a Ken Follett novel I am glued to my seat, turning pages to see what comes next. \\"A Place Called Freedom\\" kept me riveted in place for an entire summer day, I couldn't imagine putting that novel down! \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was the same way, I just couldn't wait to see where Follett would take me next. But, for some reason \\"Whiteout\\" just didn't have the same effect. \\"Whiteout\\" is an easy read, even a slow reader would have a hard time stretching this book past 2-3 days, but it's not very gripping. I found myself fading in and out of the story, for the most part the characters seemed to cookie-cutter thriller types, not genuine characters you could either root for or against. The one exception, and the only reason for my two stars, was for the character of Kit. His weasely cowardice gave the book some life, but you find yourself really not caring what happens to the rest of the characters. \\"Whiteout\\" is nowhere near Follett's best work, but if you liked \\"Third Twin\\" of \\"Hammer of Eden\\", you will probably enjoy this book too.	2005-04-25

I really enjoyed \\"The Quiet Game\\", it is very similar to a John Grisham novel, but has it's own flavor. There were times when reading the story that I was just blind-sided by what takes place. It's a great novel to just get lost in because Iles has such descriptive writing, that at times I could almost feel the Natchez heat. Iles doesn't hammer you over the head with social messages either like Grisham has done of late, he just tells a story and lets you discover the many twists and turns his mystery takes alongside the protagonist. And the Quiet Game is populated with great characters, you can just picture Judge and Livy Marston, or the small town football hero turned over the edge cop Deputy Ransom. My favorite character is former Special Agent Stone, and I really hope Iles plans to write more novels featuring that great character. I don't want to give away any of the story, but if you are a fan of Grisham's earlier works like \\"Time to Kill\\" or \\"The Firm\\", then give \\"Quiet Game\\" a shot, you won't be disappointed.	2005-04-21

So I picked up the 2nd book in the Incarnations series \\"Bearing an Hourglass\\". After just finishing this book today, I am not sure if I want to continue onto the next story. The book starts off strong with Norton's agreeing to help out a Ghost Marriage, and finding love, but as soon as he takes over the office of Time.....well the story goes downhill. I didn't think the explanation of what Time's duties were was done very well, so we are not sure what Norton is supposed to do on a daily basis. The journey's Satan sends Norton on at the beginning have the feel of short stories that have been meshed into a larger story, but that don't really belong. Instead of one long coherant tale like \\"On a Pale Horse\\", we have to follow Norton through a couple trivial \\"adventures\\" that seem like so much filler. To top it off, the part of the novel titled \\"Drawkcab\\", just gets downright annoying. I will give book 3 a shot, but if it doesn't put the series back on track, I'm giving up on it.	2005-04-01

I almost gave up on the story when Zane encountered his first flying carpet, as I am not a huge fantasy fan. But the character of Zane kept me reading, and I was intrigued by the idea of the personification of Death as a novel's protagonist. I have to say I really enjoyed the story, and liked learning, as Zane did, about the duties Death must perform. I liked the idea of someone trying to do their best and carry out Death's job with compassion and feeling. I took the story as a light fantasy, I did not try to find the deeper meanings in the story as both the author and other reviewers claim can be found in \\"On A Pale Horse\\". As a nice escape from the daily grind \\"On a Pale Horse\\" does a great job, and I am anxious to read the other \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\".	2005-03-31

The blend of horror, suspense and mystery thriller is pretty different. And the use of first person and third person points of view scattered throughout the story in also interesting. I liked the premise of the book, and for a debut novel, Marshall does a really good job of building suspense, and creating a mood. There isn't much character development found here, but the fast paced story will carry you along so that you barely notice. I think the biggest problem I had with this novel is the vague ending. I guess Marshall is intending to create a series following the Upright Man and his pursuers...? If not then we are left hanging with what amounts to an unfinished story. I wouldn't recommend this book to squemish readers either. While Ward and Bobby seem like lighthearted characters found in quite a few \\"detective\\" stories, some of the brutality found on the pages of this book does hit a little hard; especially concerning the various children sprinkled throughout the story. And in light of some of the celebrity trials, and tales of misdeeds done by major corporation CEO's flowing through the news wires today....can the story of the Straw Men be too far off?	2005-03-25

For me \\"Ender's Game\\" was like that. I would get so caught up in the struggles of Ender, and his life at the battle school, I was completely oblivious to what was going on around me. This was the first Card novel I have read, but it won't be my last. I look forward to reading more of Ender's saga, but I am also leary of starting the next book for fear that it can't possibly be as exciting or as absorbing as \\"Ender's Game\\". The funny thing is, I am not really a fan of reading Science Fiction. But, Card has created such a wonderful, and at the same time awful, world and populated that world with such believable characters you can't help but get sucked into the story. Even if you are not a fan of the Sci-Fi genre, give this book a try, the strong character development and interesting story are worth it.	2005-03-16

Burke's writing is unique, his description and dialogue really let you get lost in the stories he writes, and \\"Red Ponies\\" is no exception. There are certain things you expect when reading a James Lee Burke novel, and \\"Red Ponies\\" does not disappoint. I found the story lots of fun, and very imaginative, and while Billy Bob Holland is no Dave Robicheaux, he makes for a very interesting protagonist. \\"Red Ponies\\" is populated with interesting characters you can only find in a James Lee Burke novel, characters like Wyatt Dixon, a psychotic ex-rodeo clown. This is a fun read, and one you can easily get lost in. Sure, there are other novels by Burke that I have liked more than this one, but I would still recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller, or is a fan of Burke's other stories.	2005-03-03

And though I usually don't care for a \\"series\\" of books featuring the same characters because it usually means that no matter what happens in the novel your hero will escape unscathed (i.e. Sue Graftons alphabeticl series). But I do like the FBI Agent Pendergast character, and I enjoy the bizarre and head-scratching crimes Preston & Child present. \\"Brimstone\\" is a really fun book, and features a truly bizarre case that Pendergast and his sidekick Vincent D'Agosta are investigating. And like all good mysteries, you the reader, get to experience the twists and turns along with the heroes as they gather clues...in hopes of solving the mystery yourself before the characters in the novel do. I have seen a couple reviewers compare this novel with Sherlock Holmes and X-Files and The DaVinci Code....I guess I see that to some extent, but only if you dump some ingredients of each into a blender and hit mix. If you haven't been introduced to these characters before I highly recommend \\"Relic\\" or \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" before jumping into \\"Brimstone\\", you may get confused by some of the references to the past cases by starting with this book.	2005-02-08

I have to say, I really enjoyed the first book \\"Eye of the World\\". The way the story developed and the characters was fascinating and I was sucked in. About halfway through this second book things.....began....to....slow...way....down. I don't know if I am just tired of following of the same story or if Jordan's writing pace is just wearing me down. I enjoy in depth character studies....but usually only when it pertains to characters who will be focused on throughout the story, Jordan seems to give even the bit players a lengthy description. Also, I am beginning to suspect that almost any storyline involving the main characters; Perrin, Mat, Rand, Loial etc..are beginning to lose the tension the first book held because I don't think Jordan will let any real harm come to them in these first few books. So, when Mat's life seems in danger midway through the book, I don't feel the urgent need to read on because I already know he will survive. I don't know how...just that Jordan doesn't seem willing to kill off one of his main characters. Also, I hope that Jordan will begin to populate his novels with average looking or ugly people. So far everyone who happens along is exceedingly beautiful or strikingly handsome. I was kind of hoping Rand would be described as looking like Clint Howard just to balance things off. Still this isn't a bad book, but I don't think it lives up to the promise of the \\"Eye of the World\\". The action and climax of this book is very good once you get there, but be warned, you don't want to start this series here, you would be completely lost.	2005-01-17

Though I did like this book more than \\"The Great Hunt\\", and found it an easier read, I still don't think Robert Jordan's tale is living up to the promise of the first novel. After three books I think I know the problem with the overall story....the Dark One is just hot air. Sure, he talks a mean game, and seemed to pose quite a threat in the first novel, but by the end of this 3rd book, you start to realize what Rand and company should know as well....for all of his hard talk, the Dark One doesn't seem to pose a whole lot of menace. None of the main characters have been harmed in any way by him, if nothing else he is actually helping to point out where Rand should go to fulfill the next prophecy. Sure, our heroes have a way of finding danger with Children of the Light or Trollics, but it's not something that really builds suspense as Jordan seems loathe to actually harm any of his characters, much less kill anyone off. So you know that whatever trap the ineffectual Dark One places, Rand will get out of it. I will read the next book Shadow Rising, but if the Dark One doesn't grow fangs pretty soon...then I think I will drop out of Rand's adventure.	2005-01-17

I had never thought of myself as a fan of the \\"fantasy\\" genre...I always preferred horror to fantasy. Sure, I saw the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, but only after they had come out on dvd, and I enjoyed them. \\"Harry Potter\\" is a fun little series, but I still prefer reading Stephen King to Rowling. And so as I finished King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, I saw several reviews saying that \\"Tower\\" was good but not as good as \\"Wheel of Time\\". One of my co-workers also suggested I give \\"Wheel of Time\\" a try and brought in \\"Eye of the World\\". And while King's \\"Tower\\" series was basically a horror story with fantastic elements thrown in, right away I knew \\"Wheel\\" was pure fantasy, but decided to give it a go........and this is one of the best books I have read in years. I was immediately taken with Jordan's writing style, his description of characters, and of the settings is fantastic! Rand's story pulled me in completely and it was tough putting the book down! I do not even want to go into any part of the story for fear that I would give something away, or spoil a part of the tale for you. Go into the story as I did, not knowing a thing, just let the tale carry you away as it did me. I cannot wait to get into book 2! This is a great story and even if you are not a fan of fantasy, you can't help but enjoy these characters, and this exciting story.	2004-12-07

Okay....I have been reading the Dark Tower stories since \\"Drawing of the Three\\" came out, so I guess that makes me a \\"constant reader\\", one of the folks who have followed King's tale for the past 20+ years. So here is the final Tower novel? Who knows with Stephen King. But if this is the final book, then I can live with it. Does it end the way I wanted it to, maybe not...but then that is for every Dark Tower fan to decide for themselves. I do recommend you read the entire series, as some of the books are undoubtedly King's best writing. This final bloody and gruesome novel does wrap the story up well enough (for me anyway), and we get to meet old friends from other novels again, and meet some new ones along the way. And King's strength of slowly building suspense is represented very well here in the last book. I really would give the book 5 stars based on the novel alone, but I had to deduct one star based on the afterword. Here I have been a fan and follower of Roland for over two decades, I have been a Stephen King fan even longer, and at the end of his epic saga, with his retirement pending what does King address in his afterword.......the struggle and pain of a writer letting his epic tale end.....the enjoyment these tales have brought to him.....possible clues as to where he may go from here...No, actually King uses his Afterword to inform his fans not to try and visit him and his wife?????!!! Now I am sure the .002% of the stalker population who read this novel won't be persuaded to not \\"drop in\\" on King and family in Maine because of the Afterword. The rest of us...the standard fan of King who wouldn't think of going on a vigil to Maine are left with a sour taste in our mouths with this Afterword. It's a shame too, because if this truly is King's last novel, when he had a chance to SAY something to the Constant Readers...he took the time to chastize us instead.	2004-10-19

I was at first intimidated by The Rift's size, and the fact that Williams is basically an unknown author. I didn't know if Willimas and the story could hold my intrigue and attention for 900+ pages. The good news is that Walter J. Williams is a really good story teller, and despite what some of the other reveiwers have stated, he does a great job of character development. The science mixed in with the story is well done, and enhances the story quite well. I don't want to spoil any plot points by giving away who survives the terrifying earthquake, or what they encounter afterwared, so I will just state, that if you like disaster stories, you will enjoy The Rift. The series of disasters hitting the Midwest and deep-South is even more terrifying in the fact the Williams' disasters, the quakes, actually occured at the turn of the 19th Century.<br /><br />The are a couple reasons I only rate the book with 3 stars though. The social commentary, specifically the racial tensions in the novel are pretty heavy-handed and preachy. And the last 3rd of the novel focuses more on the would be race-war, than on the quakes, and other disasters looming on the Mississippi.<br /><br />Williams also has you invest time in some interesting characters, such as a Park Ranger working the St. Louis Arch, who after following her through some harrowing experiences is forgotten by the author. The same can be said for the many pages devoted to the devious stockbroker, and though we learn of his fate, his whole storyline just sort of peters out without a satisfying conclusion. And the final drawback to the novel is the excerpts and accounts of the 1811 quakes the begin each chapter. After about one third of the novel, these excerpts begin to repeat the same information over and over. After reading half the novel, I just began skipping them. There was really no need to insert so many old accounts of the previous quakes that did not further the current story in the novel.<br /><br />So overall, there was quite a bit in The Rift that should have been left on the editing room floor.<br /><br />But saying all of that, I would still recommend you give this entertaining book a shot and I will be sure to read the next book I see by this author.a bit in The Rift that should have been left on the editing room floor. <br />But saying all of that, I would still recommend you give this entertaining book a shot and I will be sure to read the next book I see by this author.	2004-09-22

If you like man vs. nature stories, or if you enjoyed the movie \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" then you should pick this book up. An erupting volcano has drastically changed the weather patterns in the northern hemisphere and it's up to a geologist millionaire and a British biologist to save England. These guys get everything thrown at them, an erupting volcano, a runaway iceberg, a starving wolfpack, political backstabbers, and finally face an impending war. Sure, the science may be a little far-fetched, the charaterization may seem a little trite, and the goal at which our heroes are aiming for, the bioshpere mini-earth, seems a little weak, but the action and suspense kept me turning the pages. If you enjoy a good action tale, don't pass this one up.	2004-08-25

Some of his comments regarding Bret Hart and Mick Foley have wrestling fans going back and forth about whether Ric's observations are correct or not. Agree or disagree with Flair, the book is still probably one of the most honest and entertaining books ever written about wrestling. I have read other books about &quot;Sports Entertainment&quot; written by current and former stars, and usually they are self serving and self promotional. With all things &quot;wrestling&quot;, you have to take what is presented with a grain of salt. Is it truth or just another angle? Flair's book despite and due to his controversial comments, just smacks of honesty. He is hard on some &quot;heros&quot; of the past, but is just as hard on himself as well. Even if you are not a wrestling fan, you should be able to appreciate Flair's story. His rise and fall in the wrestling world makes for a fascinating book, you will laugh at some of his road stories, and then be amazed at the brutality these guys live with daily. As a fan, after reading Flair's story, I have really come to appreciate what these atheletes go through for the sake of my entertainment. Ric's writing style is not as smooth at Foley's. Mick's books flowed with a narrative style, similar to a standard biography. Flair's book reads almost like an extended conversation with the man. He starts off on a topic, then deviates to something else, then resumes back on the topic. That should not be considered a knock on the book though, if anything it lends to it's aire of authenticity. If you are interested in the world of wrestling, or wonder what wrestling was like before being monopolized by the WWE, pick up this book. Ric's story really is compelling.	2004-07-22

I picked up &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot; right after seeing the Stephen King Miniseries on TV. At the time I wasn't sure if this was a Stephen King book or not. Once I discovered King did not write the book, I put off reading the &quot;diary&quot; for awhile and actually forgot about the book entirely. Just last week while cleaning out the basement I discovered &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot; and decided to finally read the thing. Knowing that King had little to do with the novel, I had low expectations. I figured it would be a cheesy prequel targeted to a prospective audience for the miniseries. I was wrong. The &quot;diary&quot; is a wonderful story of the supernatural, and the story of a young woman's descent into madness. The character of Ellen Rimbaugher really comes to life in the pages of her diary, as does her dispicable husband John. You can just feel the tension as the diary entries progress and you begin to geniunely feel for Ellen's plight. After finishing the novel, I felt that Ellen's story should have been the one made into a movie, not the story of the obsessive Joyce Reardon and the autistic child psychic. &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot; will keep you entertained and you will not want to put it down. The only reason I did not give &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot; a higher rating is that the ending is pretty ambivilant, which makes sense in a way, because they want you to watch the show. And also, this work is presented as a diary, so you really have to suspend belief while reading, becuase there are quite a few passages which recount dialog &amp; character actions, that seem a little too in depth to be a supposed diary entry. But overall, &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot; will keep you entertained, and if you enjoyed the &quot;Rose Red&quot; miniseries, now on DVD, you should really like this fleshed out backstory. I see used copies here listed for under $.50, and Ellen Rimbaugher's story is surely worth that.	2004-07-14
US	44884305	R1CUVXVUFVVRUH	0451191013	575466033	The Regulators	Books	3	5	11	N	N	Definitive Bachman	I just read &quot;The Regualtors&quot; again, mostly looking for a &quot;Dark Tower&quot; connection and I had actually read a couple of &quot;Bachman&quot; books, &quot;Thinner&quot; and &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, before I found out about his &quot;involvement&quot; with Stephen King. After &quot;Thinner&quot; I did not plan on reading anymore Bachman because he was too pessimistic. The protagonist usually ends up dead or worse, killing the people he cares for most. When I found out Bachman and King were one in the same, I ended up reading all of the stuff King put out under Bachman's name. But of course, I was always hit with that same downer feeling when reading a Bachman story. King's novels may be horrifying but at least the reader is often left with a sense of hope at the end, &quot;Cujo&quot; being the main exception. You feel, after reading a King novel, that, yes the hero or heroine went through hell, but they, or the world in general, are better for the suffering they endured. It makes it a pleasure to re-read King's novels. When &quot;The Regulators&quot; &amp; &quot;Desperation&quot; came out I was excited to read both, but I was a little worried about &quot;The Regulators&quot; with the Bachman name attached. I won't give anything away involving the story, which is gripping and will keep you turning pages, but it is a Bachman story. It does not end on such a sour note like &quot;Thinner&quot;, but it will give you a feeling of futility after reading it.<br />As another reviewer stated, I too found that there were too many characters without enough development. Only one or two became &quot;real&quot;, but the rest seemed like so much Regulator gunfire fodder. All in all, &quot;The Regulators&quot; is neat, in that it is a companion piece for &quot;Desperation&quot;, and it is a quick read. I finished it in about 7 hours. I would recommend getting one of the used copies listed above for under $.50, I wouldn't pay the $5 price tag for a book you most likely will only read once.will only read once.	2004-06-21
US	44884305	R2QT48X428BTDQ	0671743058	14778474	Boy's Life	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Still Holds Up After a Decade!	I first read &quot;Boy's Life&quot; when it was first published over 10 years ago. I was still a young'un in college and could really relate to Cory's tale of childhood chills &amp; thrills. I always thought &quot;Boy's Life&quot; was McCammon's best novel. I have often thought of this book and now with a son of my own I wanted to re-read &quot;Boy's Life&quot; and to capture again it's magic of youth and boyhood fantasy. I was worried though, because I began wondering if when I read again, a book that I remember so fondly, would I still view it the same and would it still have the same impact on me? I would have hated to find &quot;Boy's Life&quot; was something I had outgrown, or found the memory of the story and the story itself we completely different. The great news is that &quot;Boy's Life&quot; is still fantastic and is simply one of the greatest coming of age stories available. The magic and mystery of the novel are wonderful, and I found myself caught up once again in the goings on in the town of Zephyr. If you haven't read &quot;Boy's Life&quot; or were hesitant based on it being written by a &quot;horror&quot; writer, give this wonderful novel a chance. It is unlike anything McCammon has written, and most likely, even coming out of his semi-retirement, will remain unlike anything he will write. Also, if you have read this novel and enjoyed it, make sure you pick up Dan Simmons' &quot;Summer of Night&quot;. &quot;Summer of Night&quot; is stronger in the horror department, but the feel and flow of the book is very similar to &quot;Boy's Life&quot;.	2004-06-14
US	44884305	R25ZWJ92K0VQ7Z	0671624121	633434475	Stinger	Books	5	23	23	N	N	This is a GREAT Summer Read!!	I have read everything put out by Robert McCammon, and have enjoyed most of his novels and short stories. Stinger was the first book I read of McCammon's and it was so much fun I just re-read it this week. I see other reveiwer saying Stinger is like a B-Movie in paperback form like it's a bad thing? Sure it unfolds just like one of those cheezy 1950's sci-fi movies, and that is why it sparkles. This is not a heavy handed, fantasy driven sci-fi novel. I was not looking for something deep, or soul searching, I mean for God's sake there is a reptilian claw emerging from the desert on the books cover, why would someone be shocked, and or disappointed that Stinger is about a nasty alien monster? If you are looking for something that will make you do some soul searching look elsewhere, if you want a cool story about a rag-tag group of people uniting against a nasty foe then pick up &quot;Stinger&quot;. Some of the references are dated, like the references to Day-Glo clothes and Billy Idol, but so what it's a neat little glimpse of the 80's. If you have read any of McCammon's other books and enjoyed them then pick up &quot;Stinger&quot;.	2004-05-28
US	44884305	R7PWE9ED7RXBN	0380817160	200542713	A Winter Haunting	Books	2	5	9	N	Y	Summer of Night 2? It's Not Even Close!	Earlier this year I stumbled upon Dan Simmons and his fantastic novel Summer of Night. Summer of Night was just a fun, hackels raising read, and when I heard of this follow-up tale featuring Dale now grown up and back in his old home town, I couldn't get a copy quick enough! Having just finshed A Winter Haunting today, I feel completely let down! The courageous boy from Summer of Night, turned into a complete louse, and an unlikable protagonist in A Winter Haunting. At least Children of Night, another Simmons sorta-sequel to Summer of Night, featuring Mike, portrayed the former boy-hero as a sympathetic, and still heroic figure. A Winter Haunting turned Dale into a huge glob of self-pity. As a reader who truly cared about this character in a pevious novel, I felt like reaching into the pages to slap some sense into the now Prozac dependent slug. At what point was I supposed to be scared? By a ghost that writes in Old English? Or of a couple dogs prowling around? I mean come on, that might have worked in another story, but this is Dale from Elm Haven who fought off a murderous janitor in a rendering truck, who saw his kid brother yanked under his bed by ghostly pale arms, who crawled through miles of tunnels into an abandoned school turned into the birthplace of a demon! This guy is supposed to be afraid of a ghost that quotes Beowolf? I still give 2 stars to A Winter Haunting if for no other reason that we get to revisit Duane, Jim Harlan, Michelle Staffney and some of the other great characters from Summer of Night. And for the inclusion of the murderous skinheads who give the novel it's only gripping moments when chasing Dale through the muddy back-country of Illinois. But if you enjoyed Summer of Night as much as I did, pass on A Winter Haunting, it will only taint the characters you enjoyed so much.	2004-05-14
US	44884305	RO65F7SSKOQUK	0446362662	318619454	Summer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Taps into our Universal Fears!!	I just finished this book last night and I can't recommend it highly enough. Dan Simmons taps into our universal childhood fears like few have done before. The &quot;thing&quot; under the bed, or the &quot;monster&quot; living in our bedroom closet, the pale face outside our window. There are some genuinely frightening moments in this novel. I have seen this book compared to &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Boys Life&quot;, and I too feel it belongs in the same catagory as those fantastic novels. All I can say is that if you enjoyed either of those novels you will surely enjoy &quot;Summer of Night&quot;. Do not read any reviews that give away plot points or try to summarize this eerie tale! Read it without any forwarning of what is to come, and let Simmons' carry you away into his nightmarish story.	2004-03-26
