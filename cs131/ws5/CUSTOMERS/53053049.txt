A wonderful introduction to the general reader of who Toer is and what moves him. But also a insightful and moving testament to the power of a free mind  and the saving grace of art for those who are familiar with this writer's  work.     It was once said by Wittgenstein that Shakespeare was a great  writer, but that one sensed that Goethe was also a great man. Toer is a  great man who happens to be a true writer.	2000-04-29

Sure the final essay in the volume is not an easy read, but if you think Bakhtin is hard to read try Heidegger when he grooves along with his own lingo. Bakhtin's key idea of contextual language  and the many voicedness of novels against the backdrop of an author's voice  and that of his times is prehaps the sum total of what the novel as a genre  is. In fact, the novel is not quite a genre but an ongoing process that  escapes ossification as it changes with the times. Wonderfully done.	2000-04-24

He is never clear as to what his 'Science&quot; is which counters the grand narratives.

I find the sequel, &quot;Claudius the God&quot; the better, though less sensational, novel. It is the emotional and thematic centre of the books and the  architecture of the two tomes (which should be read one after the other)  becomes wonderfully clear.    These are arguably among the finest novels  about political power of all time. Graves was talking to democratic states  telling them of the dangers of totalitarian models and his message is still  powerful today.     Asian states still use the usual claims that strong  central 'monarchical'- like control is more important than democracy  (Republic): it is a dangerous fallacy. Look at Malaysia, Burma and  Singapore and you will find all forms of despotism, corruption and nepotism  that might have made Caligula proud, but Claudius weep.	2000-01-16

The book isn't a comedy, it's a sad and moving look at the last century's human  condition. It is an end of cycle lament at the start of modernism, the  first shots of postmodernism and the loss of humanity this all ensues.  Technology leads to the bomb and the obssession with consumerism and  political correctness that have made our era a tragic one. Literature is  the only secular salve for bruised lives and quests for happiness.	2000-01-03

The only author from Germany to honestly address the issues of what led to WWII and its aftermath.

I have read this again and am familiar with all major works of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Alas, Dostoevsky (the greater novelist) was right when he said 'Anna' was quite tedious. If the novel were a 150 pages  shorter it would have helped. 'War and Peace' is a far greater achievement.  Tolstoy's need to contrast and compare the Kitty-Levin relationship with  the Anna-Vronsky one drones on through all its permutations and  combinations thereby reducing the dramatic and thematic power of the work.  One never gets into the emotional centre of the work as one does in  Tolstoy's 'W &amp; P', 'Resurrection', and his novella 'Hadji Murad'.  Dostoevsky by comparison takes you swiftly and violently into the emotional  core of both characters and themes thereby making his work fervidly  readable and incredibly intense.	1999-12-30

In my  experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of  fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called  Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals  with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth  century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is  better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the  world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to  fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess  have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please  read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn  to  grow.	1999-12-24

It is the second time i've read it in quiet awhile and am struck by how modern it really is. The narrative structure of using Arkady as the story teller helps explain the rushed,  uneven and feverish pace at with the book unfolds: but it is an example of  the blending of form and content. All Dostoevsky's great themes are here  but on a smaller scale. The novel is a clear example of a great writer  warming up to the themes and ideas that he was to explore fully in his next  work and masterpiece, 'The Bros K.' 'The Adolescent' is an excellent  introduction to the thematics and style of the world's greatest novelist	1999-12-22

Dixon is the direct descendant of Joyce and Faulkner tinged with his own modern day 'end of cycle' vision of the middle aged man in the West. Thorough craftsmanship, tremendous empathy  with human follies and strengths and great humour. And a damn sight easier  reading than Gaddis (who is still greater I think).

We get so caught up with H.H.'s narrative and the violent ending of the book, that we forget about the most important  person: Lolita. What happened to her? What is the story from her point of  view? Is she not a human being too, as her Mother and the others...? Or are  they part of an entertainment, the type we want -- torrid, action filled,  mindless but seemingly fun; the prurient fantasies that have so  desensitised people that children now take to killing one another with  guns.	1999-05-18

The reviewer who can give a work of Dostoevsky's one star is no better than the Nazi's who burn books because they cannot stand the sight of it. I've  not only grown up with this book, but rereading it (the Pevear, Volokhonsky  version is the best) again 14 years later, has revealed to me the true  power and insight in it which I did not detect before.    The book is  indeed about the strong man, one who can say he is sorry and pick up the  pieces from there. A landmark novel of many layers and a fitting  introduction to the rest of the great novels of probably the greatest  writer of all time.	1999-05-17

The wild story about Zembla is a sop to the real beauty and tragedy of the poem, 'Pale Fire'.

His work is a profound examination into the human condition and man's contigency with the world. In recreating his life through memory, Proust has in magnificent prose, tried to understand what confronted all great writers: what is truth, what is reality, what is illusion.    The only writer/thinker to surpass Proust in this was Nietzsche. His idea of eternal recurrence is the corollary of Proust's recreated world via remembering and deja vu. Simply wondrous!	1998-05-07

What Kant, Hegel, Marx and other great thinkers have done was create their own system and metaphysics on which rests the universe of their ideas. Snopes and co. are the people who live in Faulkner's world of the Deep South which is a prallel universe to the one we live in... it is as always full of intense characters, flowing lyricism, violence and shifting view points which unerringly and uncomfortably resonate in our own world.	1998-02-15
