US	52982196	R3RXSW5GQNRGQS	4770029322	530932	Appreciations of Japanese Culture	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	Perennial Classic	Donald Keene is the foremost scholar of Japanese Culture.  He could be considered a living national treasure, and I feel fortunate to be alive as his contemporary.  His body of work is enormous, his influence immeasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edition of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are every bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is a superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a new edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound version, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some of his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infinitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of cultures amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed Taroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.	2005-10-14

I read this book before I enrolled in any classes with Dr. Rogers, before I ever moved to Hilo, Hawai'i to persue a Japanese Studies major.  My opinion may still be biased, but I was highly enamoured from the very beginning, before even meeting or talking to him. <br /> <br />I really love the selection of authors.  Some are well-known, although these pieces are not.  Others are not well-known, at least in America.  Sensei chose material that would be largely unfamiliar to an American audience, which suits me just perfectly.  If I wanted things I'd already read, why would I bother?  I had read none of these stories, however, and was unknowledgable with more than half of the authors. <br /> <br />The translations are highly readable.  I'm impressed at what a good writer Sensei is.  As I haven't read the Japanese originals, nor am I immediately capable of reading them, I can't comment on their accuracy, however, I am Dr. Rogers' student, after all, and I know his fastidious habits. <br /> <br />One of the best features of this text is the large introduction Sensei has penned.  Interesting, insightful, readable and charming, it shows that Sensei is not just a translator and re-writer but a writer himself, and as I said above, I was delighted by his skill.  I'd happily devour an entire book of his essays on Japan.  I have so much to learn from him! <br /> <br />I couldn't recommend this any more highly.  While the stories are readable and entertaining in their own right, they'll also give you insight into Tokyo, the main thrust of the book.  Their organization by geography of the city is a cute bonus. <br /> <br />Kore wa totemo hontouni ii desu yo!	2005-08-26

The negative reviewer said \\"I can't write enough bad things about this product,\\" or something along those lines, but he hardly even WROTE anything bad about them! <br /> <br />Order--why do you want them in order?  What purpose could that possibly serve? <br /> <br />Font--they look fine to me.  What, exactly, is wrong with the font?  Is it too small?  If you're going to be reading Japanese competently, you're going to have to read font this small, and smaller, in the real world.  Japanese use small font sometimes. <br /> <br />The only gripe I have with these cards is the romanji.  I actually would prefer to just read the kana.  The romanji is a distraction and hindrance, in my opinion.  I know the kana, and if I did not, I would get kana flashcards, learn the kana, and then use these. <br /> <br />I have actually whited out the romanji on my cards.  All 1000 of them. <br /> <br />I think they're a steal.  1000 words is a great vocabulary foundation.	2005-06-10

I admit that \\"True Encounters with Hawai'i's Fire Goddess\\" is a bit of a shocker for a subtitle.  How can one verify that these tales are true?  They're of a personal flair.  The fervency with which the writers speak is obvious.  Perhaps that's not something that can be faked.  The tales also smack of truth to me, someone who has studied mythology and doesn't believe it's merely \\"myth\\".  It is not a book of fact, however.  It's a book of story.<br /><br />The compiler himself, Rick Carroll, reveals background information and tells  of a personal encounter himself, and they're a good addition to the group.<br /><br />A few of the stories seem out of character for Pele, being downright scary (although, as one writer quotes, \\"Fear only living spirits; dead ones can do you no harm,\\" and I believe that); and Pele my prank on occassion, but she never sets out to freak the refuse out of anyone.  I can't help but think their inclusion misrepresents Pele, but they're very interesting nonetheless, and I'm pleased to have read them.<br /><br />If you're interested in the topic, this anthology is worth getting.  I intellectually devoured it in one sitting, and I'm hungry for more information on Pele.  There isn't much else like it that I've come across, at least not having to do with Pele.  Luckily, there's a suggested reading list at the back.<br /><br />I hope to meet Pele myself, as I'll be a student on the Big Island of Hawai'i this fall, attending the University for a few years.  If you should have your own encounter, respect her (it) in every way possible.  She may be used as a metaphor to represent a force of nature, but she *is* a force of nature herself, under God, and deserves to be greatly honored and treated as such.  Scorn her, and you'll invoke not only her wrath but the wrath of the Creator.	2005-02-25

I will tell you right off the bat that I like this book very much, that I love Donald Keene very much, and that he's my sensei.  Therefore, go ahead and mark the \\"this review was not helpful\\" box if you must.    I'm not saying I've lost all forms of objectivity...  I'm just saying that this book was clearly intended, at its core audience level, for someone like me, and, quite simply, it has hit the mark.  Call me biased if you want, but if you're a reader of my particular bend, it shouldn't matter.    It's not a perfect book.  It could have included more.  However, what it does, it does damn well, and it's very deserving of five-stars.    Throughout the different sections, Donald's essays on various topics are presented, often introduced through humorous and/or meaningful anecdotes of his own.  The entries are all very interesting and lively to read, insightful memoirs from someone who understands Japanese literature, language and culture well and conveys that understanding better than probably anyone else.  Writings included in this book are rare, and they are not found in his other volumes.  Most of them were published in magazines and newspapers, many Japanese.  Some of this is appearing in English for the first time, and all of it, unless you have access to tremendous research capabilities, will be difficult, if not impossible, to find elsewhere.  It is all of high-quality and more than worthy of a spot on the bookshelf of any taroukaja.    Donald Keene will be a legend after he dies.  If you want to get to know him, read this book.  It's as close as you can get to him, and nothing is hidden.    So there's my bias for you.  I laid it bare on the table.  It's warranted, though, and since no one else has taken the time to review this book, you're stuck with my very favorable opinion. :)	2004-09-30

We really, really, REALLY need to see more readers like this being produced and made available to students of Japanese.  <br />In a graded-reader series, which was originally intended to span at least 9 volumes, but, unfortunately, spans only three that I know of, this is the very first.  A small book for English-speakers who are learning Japanese, it includes two short stories by Teramura Teruo, translated by E.R. Skrzypczak.  His hame is certainly more confusing than the text.  In it, very little kanji is used, and when it is used, it has furigana (little kana) on top to indicate to you the pronunciations.  The main drive of this edition is to cement some vocabulary in place for the reader.  It is meant for the student who wants to, FINALLY, read some Japanese rather than just reading &quot;about Japanese,&quot; and read something in story-form rather than just learning how to ask what time it is and such.<br />On each page is the simple Japanese text, facing an English translation (quite a good translation, I might add, suitable for reading even if you don't care to practice your Japanese).  This is about as simple as Japanese reading can be.  The point is that using story and literature, the reader can increase his or her proficiency radically.  Your reading speed will increase, your vocabulary will increase and become cemented, you will learn how Japanese &quot;write&quot; and speak colloquially, and you will be prepared to, one day, pick out and read any Japanese work you might wish to peruse.<br />Check out volumes 4 and 9 of this series as well (1, 4 and 9 are the only volumes released, as far as I can tell, and they are all very much worth picking up, despite the inflated cost as they become rare).  By volume 9, it is getting fairly complex.	2004-01-26

There was a huge hole in the market for a book like this, and it is now filled.  What troubles me is that it seems to be out of print.  Or is it still in print in the expensive, hardback version?<br />Whatever the case, students of Japanese owe it to themselves to get their hands on a copy.  It seems to do everything right.  And what it lacks in cute pictures or multiple colors, it makes up for in content and intelligence of presentation.  First of all, there is no romanji.  Everything is carried out via katakana/hiragana and kanji (though the kanji has furigana so you will never be lost for the reading--a great touch).  This is a huge plus.  Romanji is so distracting, and if you already know the basics of the language, which this book assumes, you will know the scripts.  Therefore, why use romanji?<br />Secondly, the book is just plain useful for delving deeper into the language and understanding it.  For instance, I opened it to a section of the differences in particles.  Exactly what constitutes the use of &quot;wa&quot; &quot;ga&quot; or &quot;wo&quot;?  How do you know which to use, other than just through having a &quot;feeling&quot; for which is correct?  Well, this book will tell you.<br />When a book this valuable (and going out of print??) comes along, I am almost tempted to get another copy in case something happens to my first one.  If you can snap this up used, do it.  If you have to pay $65 for a hardback edition, do that, too.  Do whatever it takes to get this book.  There just isn't anything else that can replicate it (although Kodansha's array of books comes close).<br />I can't recommend this more highly.	2004-01-25

If you hate the Japanese scripts, those being hiragana and katakana (with usage of Chinese characters, i.e. kanji), you are in luck.  This book, fortunately for you and unfortunately for the rest of us, has absolutely no Japanese script in it.  It's entirely presented in romanji.<br />This is a bad thing, as far as I'm concerned.  If you really want to learn mastery of the Japanese language, you will NOT use romanji.  Why would you?  Wouldn't you want to learn to read it, too, and not just speak it?  <br />The concept of this book is that speech is made up of units, not of words.  For instance, traditional grammar books will teach you vocabulary words, then make up sentences with them.  Wouldn't it be faster to learn phrases since that's how language is usually spoken?  So that's what this book does; it presents the Japanese language in groups of phrases, and it does a very good job of it.<br />Alas, if it were not for the romanji...  I wish they'd do a kana version.  The least they could have done was put kana AND romanji in.  I would have preferred it to no kana at all.<br />So, I cannot recommend it.  It's a shame, too.  It's an otherwise marvelous, fun book.	2004-01-23

Breaks the heart.<br />A friend of mine purchased this set and was so psyched about it, and with good reason.  It makes some wonderful promises, and it is poised to deliver.  It's an exciting compendium of educational bliss, the apple of the eye of anyone who is excited to learn the Japanese language.<br />However, there is a giant, stinky, malevolent worm in the apple, and there is a sliver--no, a plank--in the eye.<br />As a few other reviews have mentioned, this system makes absolutely exclusive use of romanji, which is rendering the Japanese language in Roman characters (Latin, English, whatever--this alphabet that I'm typing with right now).  While the Roman characters are great for English and every European language, bloody useful, they absolutely suck for Japanese.  If you never want to be fluent with the language, fine, romanji is useful for you.  But if you're seeking fluency, for the love of God, look elsewhere.  It'll screw up your pronunciation and effectively cause you to have to re-learn the language if you ever want to actually READ it, not to mention write it.<br />What a shame.  I'm pretty sure that this would be about the best text/audio combo in existence if it had just gone the extra mile.  Come on, Hiroko Storm.  Please, do a kana version!  What a brilliant tool this could have been!<br />Try Japanese for Busy People (KANA edition) with the audio CDs instead.  Use Pimsleur CDs.  And use Remembering the Hiragana to learn the hiragana and keep it.  Save romanji for the tourists.  Fluency demands competency.<br />I know this sounds harsh, but trust me; it's just because I'm vastly, hurtfully disappointed.  Not only that, but I'm going to have to explain Japanese to my friend all over again when he finally admits that romanji is going to ruin him.<br />What a bummer.	2004-01-17

What a wonderful survey of Japanese literature from the very beginning!  Ending around 1870 actually makes sense.  In fact, even doing that, a lot is still left out, I'm sure, but that's what the various modern readers are for.<br />I had no idea this was originally published in 1955.  It fooled me.  I didn't know about its history or the history of its editor.  I just picked it up, opened it, and began reading.<br />I have a pretty decent background in Japanese history and humanities, so I started skimming for favorites that I'd read ABOUT but never actually READ.  Lots are in there.  Even better, there's a bunch I'd never heard of, and I suppose that was the original idea.<br />I agree that this could be a little deeper, but cripes, it's from 1955.  I'm sure it's time for a new anthology, yes, but let's not ignore this one.<br />The Heian era in particular provided the backdrop to the creation of some of the world's most amazing literature.  Murasaki Shikibu is represented here.  It would be a travesty if she were not.  She's quite the interesting character, as is her rival, whose name I cannot spell off-hand and do not want to embarrass myself with.  :)<br />There are lots of readers on the market.  I've acquired most of them.  As much as I enjoy the modern readers with their bite, edge and esoteric qualities (there is just something indescribable about modern Japanese culture, whether it be literature, manga, anime or video games), there will always be such a spot in my heart for this stuff, particularly that of the Heian era.<br />For anyone who's a fan of Japan, this isn't to be missed.<br />Thank you for allowing me to gush.  :)	2004-01-17

If someone would have told me that I'd be able to learn the Kanji at a rate of 25 per day (or more), I'd have thought they were selling some sort of dorky memory product on TV.  I wouldn't have bothered.  If someone told me I'd remember their meaning and writing, even stroke order, very easily, after 30 minutes or so spent on each set of 15 or 25 (or more), I'd have thought it was impossible.  But it's exactly what I'm doing.  And if anyone could see that I'm doing it now, they would be impressed.  They would think I was a bloody lingual genius being able to learn this fast (or just psychotically motivated).<br />Now let me tell you a secret.  I'm a pretty smart person, but know what?  I'm probably not much of a genius, or if I am, this sort of \\"absolute memory\\" is certainly not my genius.  It is THIS BOOK that gets the credit (and neither am I psychotically motivated, for the record--it is rare that I muster even this much motivation).<br />Here's a little story of how I amazed myself just now.  As I've been going through the book, I've been using little flashcards to review (messy ones I made myself--there are PILES of them all over my room, hehe).  Not too surprisingly (I trusted this book and expected this), I could remember the meaning of every single kanji I reviewed.  Great, huh?  But I still said to myself, \\"Well, remembering the meaning is the main thing.  It's no big deal if I can't write them from memory.\\"  Of course, I was expecting that, already impressing myself by remembering their meaning, I wouldn't be able to also write them--that was just too hard.  But guess what?  Just now, I proceeded to write out, from memory, with no mistakes and 95% accuracy, every single Kanji I've learned.  <br />How can this be?  I am really proud of myself, that's for sure.<br />Simply, this book uses \\"imaginative memory\\" instead of brute memory.  Little anecdotes and funny mental images will click in your mind, and you'll easily recall these arcane little word pictures,these Kanji.  And you're thinking it must be harder than it sounds, right?  Wrong!  It's actually easier than I make it sound!!  (Although I should mention that it DOES require effort.  At first, I thought it was never going to work.  But then I tried the flashcards and remembered every one of them.  It works so well that you don't really even notice--it's like you've always known the things.)  <br />PUSH through, give it a shot.  You will HIGHLY impress yourself.  Want to learn kanji?  If you are self-motivated (and want to teach yourself--this will NOT work very well as part of a class), this is the way to do it.<br />This is volume 1, and it will teach you the writing and meaning of over 2000 Kanji (it's like 2145 or something).  It will NOT, however, teach you their \\"reading,\\" meaning while you'll know what they mean when you see them written, you won't know how to say them in Japanese.  That is the job of volume 2, a guide to the reading of the Kanji.  Volume 3 is the advanced course, teaching you both the reading and writing of a bunch more Kanji that are useful for reading Japanese novels, technical documents, video games, etc.<br />Some say this is a flaw of the book, that meaning/writing and reading are seperate, but it's not a flaw!  It is its beauty.  By isolated these seperate skills into two volumes, and focusing on each in turn, it unlocks your true ability to learn.<br />These books are amazing.  I highly endorse and recommend every single one of them:  Remembering the Hiragana/Katakana, then Remembering the Kanji volumes 1, 2 and 3, all by James W. Heisig, who has basically written the best way to learn Japanese by accident (it's how he learned, and fellow students begged him to write out his notes for them, thus, the books were born).<br />One final note: If one were to take two lessons a day, about like 30 Kanji a day, you'll finish in a month (there are around 62 lessons in this book).  So, really, you could go through all three books in a matterof 3 months.  Slow it down a little, one lesson a day, and it's 6 months, which is still jaw-droppingly fast.  The Hiragana/Katakana book (which you should do first) will take about two weeks (it's pretty short).  Not bad for a crash-course in reading Japanese, is it?  Then all you have left is grammar and stringing it all together into your own thoughts and sentences.  At least now we can say that THAT, the grammar, speaking, etc, is the hard part, because for years, westerners have said the \\"hard part\\" was learning their weird writing systems.  Well, now that's the easy part, thanks to Heisig-san, and if you like the language, even the hard part will be enjoyable for you.<br />I'll see you in Japan!	2003-03-01

While this book is highly excellent, James W. Heisig's \\"Remembering the Hiragana/Katakana\\" is a much easier, quicker and effective way for memorization and mastery of the syllabaries. HOWEVER, why not use this for reinforcement once you've finished Heisig's book (and for help with dipthongs, etc, which Heisig doesn't explain at all)? That's what I'm doing. And of course, then move on the Japanese For Busy People I, but please make sure you get the KANA VERSION. Don't use romanji! You will thank me!<br />How anyone could actually learn Kana from a workbook like this, I don't know.  It would take LOTS of drilling and memorization.  With Heisig, it's effortless.  This book is the best of the memorization school, so for that, four stars.<br />Also, please be sure to try Heisig's \\"Remembering the Kanji\\" books (three volumes) when you're ready to begin mastery of the tools of deeper written thought.	2003-02-23

But obviously close enough to warrant a &quot;perfect&quot; rating.<br />While I could easily chime in with the other 5-stars, let me tell you what this book lacks.  <br />During the Hiragana, not much time is spent on the plosive and voiced mark.  You'll probably figure them out mid-way through the Katakana section, but still, he could have put more effort into explaining them, even just in an appendix.<br />Also, while he gives you a great device to help you understand the order words appear in a Japanese dictionary, he doesn't explain it all that well.  You'll need to fumble around a little in a Japanese dictionary to figure it out.<br />Also, for some reason, in the katakana section, he occassionally assumes you know some basic kanji.  Why this would be the case when most readers have just finished hiragana, I don't know.  But you can get through it all right anyway, trust me.  I don't know any kanji, and I'm doing all right (katakana seems easier than hiragana, actually).<br />And finally, and most importantly, NOTHING is said about dipthongs.  What are dipthongs?  Well, I myself haven't quite figured it out yet, although I'm on the right track (a small &quot;ya&quot; written to the right and down of &quot;chi,&quot; for instance, makes it into &quot;cha&quot;--confusing, right?).  Anyway, how hard would it have been to have a little apendix on that?  It really warrants a lesson in and of itself, but all he says is something like &quot;all you've got left to learn are dipthongs, which you'll find in the introductory pages of any Japanese grammar book&quot;.  Um, like which grammar book?  I bought this one to teach me.<br />Anyway, these quibbles can't outweigh my love and enthusiasm for this book.  I really works, I SWEAR to you.  I can read hiragana, and I've had the book for a week!  30 minutes a day and a little more practice is all it takes.  If you have the dedication, this book will help you do it, no doubt about it.<br />Once you're done here, just moveon to Heisig's excellent series of &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot; (Vol-1 is basic Kanji, Vol-2 is pronounciation of those kanji, more kanji, and some grammar, Vol-3 is advanced stuff). This track is definitely the wisest choice, as it will prepare you well, and you could easily be fluent in under a year if you work at it every day with him.<br />If you just want a jump-start into the language after learning hiragana/katakana (but PLEASE learn that first), then try Japanese for Busy People (Kana Version).  But Heisig's route really is best, as unorthodox as it might seem at first.<br />To sum up: get this book.  And avoid romanji, in all its forms, at ALL COSTS.  It will only hinder you if you truly want fluency in reading/writing and speaking Japanese.	2003-02-20

The extensive use of Romanji (Japanese words written using English/Roman characters, i.e. romanized Japanese) ruins it for any serious student of the language. If you just want to speak it and use it out of necessity, fine, but if you want to embrace and absorb the Japanese language, you are going to need to learn hiragana/katakana first (try Heisig's book Remembering the Hiragana). If you already know hiragana/katakana, then why are you bothering with romanji? Get a Kanji dictionary that doesn't have Romanji instead. Try Kodansha's Furigana dictionaries (they use hiragana/katakana to show you pronounciation instead of romanji). <br />I know I sound like a fuddy-duddy and you're getting angry at me, but TRUST ME, if you avoid romanji while learning Japanese, it will save you so much blood, sweat and tears! You will thank me, I SWEAR it!	2003-02-16

I think the NASB translation, being the most literal, lends itself most aptly to this sort of thing.  I love the NIV, but when you're doing Greek-Hebrew studies, it's better to have a  literal translation.<br />This is still a must-have Bible, unless you know  Hebrew and Greek and can read it without help.  :-)	1999-03-11

I'll do it for them.  :-)<br /><br />It's actually a Missouri Synod Lutheran version of  Zondervan's NIV Study Bible.  It has all the  features of the NIV Study Bible, plus lots more, like quotes from Martin  Luther, etc.<br /><br />Many of the study notes from the Zondervan have been changed or removed, and many more notes have been added.<br /><br />Be mindful that the Missouri Synod takes a \\"moderate fundamentalist\\" view, including all the baggage that implies.	1999-03-11

Any Bible  commentary that ties the Wedding Garment parable into good works (??!) is  too legalistic for me.  If you want to be chided and attempt to earn your salvation, this might be a good one for you.	1999-03-07

I think it's about the best study Bible there is.  It doesn't go into specialty, really, but that's kind of the beauty of it.  It isn't offensive to any denomination at  all (unless you're a legalist, I guess).  The notes are great, the articles  are great, and it's just an all-around wonderful endeavor from Oxford, like  its RSV predecessor.  (Speaking of that, I think the reason Oxford did this  new Bible is because of the NRSV translation that came out fairly recently.   It's great, and definitely warranted an update of the Oxford Annotated.   Glad to have both!  :-)  <br />BTW--buy this.	1999-02-23

(To the reviews below)  Perhaps you guys should comment on this particular edition of the Bible rather than the Bible itself?  I appreciate the rebuke against the one-star review (kind of funny, actually--Jesus and naive in  the same sentence), but prospective buyers should probably check out actual  reviews (see other Oxford Annotated Bibles on Amazon.com for reviews of  them).<br />I myself regard this as about the best middle-of-the-road study  Bible around.  It's wonderful.	1999-02-23

Sometimes it doesn't even get the correct meaning across.  It  was a valiant effort, though...  Try the New Internation Version, Today's  English Version, New Jerusalem Bible (my favorite), etc.	1999-02-03
US	52982196	R1VCBNBGKJNVL6	031090806X	787474569	NIV Compact Reference Bible	Books	4	22	24	N	N	Kind of a pocket reference Bible	This is actually a pocket-sized Bible (both the Old and New Testaments), and it has a small concordance/dictionary at the back, words of Jesus in  red letters, and in the center of each page are references to other verses.   For instance, it might tell you the chapter and verse of a similar miracle  of Jesus, or perhaps the same event in another of the synoptic  Gospels.<br />Not bad, I say.  I wonder why it isn't more popular?  Oh, and a  word of warning.  The type is pretty darn small.  Even if you have perfect  eye-sight it's not exactly 100% easy to read.  You kind of have to strain  just a tad bit.  The paper is a bit think for my tastes, but gosh, it can't  really be helped.<br />Feel free to e-mail me any questions.  I still happily  recommend this.	1999-01-29

Actually, this translation isn't quite as accurate as you might think. In fact, it dumbs things down so much in some cases that it becomes inaccurate. If you buy this Bible, make sure you also have an accurate  translation (NIV, NRSV, RSV) to compare to. Also, the study notes in this  Bible, in some cases, sound more condemning than anything. Instead of  explaining what is going on, it's constantly telling you how to shape up  your life. I suppose it is a Life Application Bible, though, after all. I  recommend the Quest Study Bible and the Oxford Annotated Bible over this  one.	1999-01-28

What a wonderful introduction to Martin Luther!  If you're thirsty for his writings, this is the book you should start with.  Searching for books by him usually turns up many expensive volumes, meant for preachers, not  laymen.  That's why I'm so glad I found this book.  It's laid out  perfectly, to give you a wonderful idea of who Luther was, the Reformation,  and, most importantly, his theology.  Every Lutheran should be firmly  introduced to Luther (no matter how obvious it seems, it doesn't happen  enough), especially those fundamentalists of the Missouri Synod and  Lutheran Brethren who have drifted so far from him and the Gospel of  Christ.  This is a wonderful book.  Take it from an ELCA pastor.  This book  will show you.  I'm seriously considering giving a copy to each of my  confirmation students every year.  Let Grace reign, not legalism and  judgement.	1999-01-19
