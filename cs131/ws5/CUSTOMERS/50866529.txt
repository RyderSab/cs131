US	50866529	RQCX52ISNN7LR	0316781487	223736820	Light on Snow	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Below average for Shreve	I've been looking forward to a new Shreve novel for sometime, and was somewhat disappointed with this one.  It contains some of the typical elements of her novels that are so appealing - seemingly normal people faced with the complicated task of surviving through grief - it lacked much of the character development that Shreve's fans are used to seeing in her work. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this as a pleasure read, but comes short of displaying the real capability of the author.	2004-11-08
US	50866529	R2GIJZM9WK3V8W	0345449347	990748107	The Fourth Hand	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Best quality: Uniqueness	The story that Irving weaves combines a barage of eccentric characters: A man who loses his hand, his doctor, the man who's hand is donated to replace the lost hand, a wife who demands visitation rights to the transplanted hand... the list could stretch on and on.<br />The most appealing thing about this novel was the uniqueness of the story - I can assure you that you will not read another even remotely the same.  Fortunatly, the plot moves, so while the story itself lacks some of the depth that we are used to from Irving, it is not an effort to negotiate.  Overall, I was expecting something more worthy of Irving's name.	2003-01-12

The story begins with their move to a new apartment, a new job and a new school.  Her son, Radley, is a comic buff, is much more excited than she to discover that the author of his favorite comic resides just a few floors away.  Mitch Dempsey falls for the boy and mother almost instantly.  But Hester must overcome the demons of her first marriage if they are to have the chance of becoming a family.<br />DUAL IMAGE<BR>Ariel Kirkwood, a young actress on the rise, has just landed a role that could launch her career.  Playing the cruel, undermining ex-wife of script writer Booth DeWitt would be her most difficult role to date.  But winning isolationist Booth's trust, and love, proves to be more difficult than any role she could imagine.<br />This is the light, short-length Roberts.  I read each of these in a few hours.  Its the type of Roberts that makes you relax without digging too deep into the characters.  I ranked this a four only because I prefer her full length murder/romances - but there is nothing wrong with these as well!	2003-01-12

Adrienne Willis is weary of watching her daughter Amanda struggle through the untimely death of her husband.  In an effort to comfort and teach her daughter that life must go on, she opens a bottle of wine, and her heart, to share a secret that she has harbored for much of her life...<br />...At 45, Adrienne's husband leaves her for another woman.  Devestated, she believe's herself a failure as a wife, struggling to make ends meet for her family and her father whom is housed in full-time care facility.  As a reprive, she agrees to watch a small inn in the small town of Rodanthe for a few days while the owner is away.  The single guest, Paul Flanner, and the huricanne that strikes while they are alone, change her forever...<br />This is a typical Sparks novel.  If you've been moved by his other stories, than this one will touch you as well.  I've rated this as only 4 stars because of its lack of origionality.  Reading other Sparks' novels I could have guessed at the conclusion before picking up the book.  But there is a comfort in that as well.  Knowing the unique manner in which Sparks can describe and capture love and dispair is one of the charms associated with his novels.<br />If you've yet to read anything by Sparks, this is as good a place to begin as any.	2003-01-01

Its post Cold War, and though many of us, most in fact, feel the threat of the nuclear age fade with each day Clancey brings to light the dangers that we may still face.<br />As detailed and suspensfully as ever, TC has brought to life a world drama that seems as plausible as it does outrageous.  Dr. Jack Ryan is Deputy Director of the CIA and working closely with the White House.  Things remain tumultous in the middle east, Russia is struggling with a newfound government that is fighting to survive, Japan is turning tricks in the trade game, and the intel world is as alive as ever.  Clancey takes us into the Oval Office and shows us, with uncomfortable ease, the frightening reality of a human president and his cabinent members.<br />Clancey has a way of twisting the unknown into what could be our biggest nightmare.  The secrets that are held within the governments of the world seem even larger to those of us that are blissfully unaware of them in our everyday life.  In a time when our nation seems on edge about the events and terrorists abroad, perhaps the largest threat lies within our own boarders...	2002-08-26

The ending was fairly predictable, and the pace of the novel seemed fairly slow.<br />Despite that, I found the story to be origional and interesting.  It's the story of a man that is summoned home by his ill father.  Upon his arrival, he finds his father deceased, and a boat load of money stashed away in a cabinent.  He hides the money, and immediately, someone starts to tail him.  He's chasing the origion of the money, and someone is chasing him...	2002-03-13

Four years later, someone has found him, and the drama begins...<br />I was pretty surprised bu the conclusion of this novel, and there were lots of twists and turns along the way.

No one who loves him believes he could have committed such a heinous crime, and even the judge is leary, and he is only sentenced to a year in prision.  While being transported from one facility to another, there is a car crash - from which he is the only survivor, and he is led into the subway by a mysterious man.  He imagines that he has escaped, but finds himself trapped in a game in which he is anything but free.<br />The story itself is interesting, but fairly reminiscent of something else I've read (maybe the Most Dangerous Game??).  Anyway, if you're a Sau fan or not, you should enjoy this twisted tale.	2002-03-13

The two are obviously in love, but Connor can't help but desire her, and he falls deeply in love.

The rumors that she's a sex fiend and a habitual drug user are easily overlooked when he's with such a beautiful woman.  But something goes wrong, on their first date, and he finds himself in more trouble than he could have ever imagined.<br />The plot itself is captivating, and what really draws us in, is that the story centers around our favorite address in the world, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.	2001-10-27

Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  I found Dr. Cross' character, and his family, to be both intriguing and comforting.<br />The story is of the second coming of a serial killer that Cross put in jail some years back (you may remember Gary from Along Came a Spider).  Of course, there are several plot twists that Patterson has thrown, the most profound being that Cross falls in love.<br />I was very pleased with this novel, and I'll be sure to catch up on the Patterson books which I have already missed.	2001-10-23

We can't help but love Jonah, his young son, and its obvious why both fall in love with his teacher, Sara. But like all stories, this romance is too good to be true.<br />The title of this novel is superbly chosen, as it holds both literal and methaphoric meaning to the novel. For readers familiar with Spark's, you'll love this latest story. If you're new to the author, be prepared for a sophiticated and mature story of love and loss. I'm already looking forward to the next one.	2001-10-12

I was particularly intruiged with the plot line of wine making, and would have to say the Ms. Roberts did an excellent job researching the topic, as it provided a wonderful base and backdrop for the book.<br />The story is concerned with the melding of families, and how they must stand together in the face of disaster.  Old and young, new and ancient bonds are renewed.  This is a great introduction to Roberts if you're unfamiliar with her, and long-time fans are sure to love it as well.	2001-10-12

After she believes he has been killed, she is left to forge a new life as an independent English woman, a life far from the one she left behind in China.<br />Though the two main characters spend much of the stroy apart, its interesting to see their love for one another grow.  Like all good stories, this one seemed to be over too soon, but leaves us feeling satisfied and content with the conclusion.  I'll definantly read more of Ms. Putney's work.	2001-09-21

He's expecting the fall out and hatred from the community, but not the love he finds in his new boss...<br />This is anything but a superficial story.  Picoult delves into complex issues concerning trust and predjudice, the guilt that can overshadow a man who has merely been accused of rape, the complexities of the lives of teenage girls, and the trauma that accompanies sexual abuse.  The author effectively supports both sides of Megan's Law, and gives us insight and understanding into all sides of a no win situation.<br />If you're looking for some light reading, this novel is not the best choice to pick up. I was, however, mesmerized.  Caught in Salem Falls late into the night, unable to set it down.	2001-08-17

Each book continued to get better and I was disappointed that the story had to end.<br />The first two novels (Born in Fire and Born in Ice) are about two sisters who have known each other, lived by each other their entire lives.  Their stories are interesting and inspiring as well, by Roberts leaves the closing novel as the hummdinger.<br />Born in Shame is the story of a third sister.

K.W. creates a turbulent setting amidst the Civil War.  One full of violence, passion, love and understanding.<br />The main characters are beautifully drawn out, as is the story line.  One of my favorite aspects of any Woodiwiss book is that the romantic struggle ends somewhere before the end of the story, and we are able to view the couple grow together, face adversary as one.

It was a far cry from his best work, and not quite as well done as some of his earlier novels, but I still thought it was an excellect novel.<br />Grisham is almost scary with his account of the abilities of the CIA, and the power of money in American politics.

Roberts' Sanctuary is riddled with emotional obstacles for its characters, all of whom are smart, witty, and independent.<br />In a story which revolves around the disappearance of a woman nearly 20 years earlier, we can still see the characters grieving, mourning, and very disturbed.  An excellent effort on the authors part.<br />Though the ending did not come as much of a surprise, I still enjoyed the read, as I most always do with a Nora Roberts book.	2001-07-16

In fact, I felt that the addition of the second novel added even more depth to the familiar characters that were introduced in the first.<br />Christopher Snow has a rare impairment of the skin that makes it impossible to spend anytime exposed to ultraviolet rays, and so he must live in the night.  <br />Their small town, Moonlight Bay, is being over run by a government experiment gone bad.  His friends, and un-naturally intelligent dog named Orson, his girlfriend Sasha, and long time bud Bobby are the only people remaining that can be trusted.<br />I thought the combination of time travel and quantum mechanics theories was interesting, though Koontz could have delved a little deeper into the issues.  But all in all I was very extertained.<br />And for those of you who haven't read the first novel, there's no real need to.

While there is love, passion, and romance in the book, the plot inherintly lies around mystery and suspense.<br />Can a psychatrist and a homicide detective overcome their predjudices and work together to find the first serial killer to ever stalk the streets of D.C.?  Along the way, Roberts introduces us to the rather dim side of both professions, sitting us in both a dingy police station and a posh office.  The story is beautiful and frightening all at one.  I loved it.	2001-07-06

He is devious and clever in his writing, capturing our attention as well as our imagination.<br />Grisham has created a story about the biggest government cover-up since Watergate.  It is sensational, realistic, and immensly frightening.  It is beautiful.  It is destructive.  And should definantly be read.	2001-07-05

I can usually stay up all night in persuit of closure in a novel, but I could not dredge through this book.<br />The novel starts out very interesting, the premise of two parties arguing over a home the simultaneously belongs to both and neither of them.  And that, I believe, is where the book stalls.<br />I was impressed by the author's strong character development, fluid prose, and origionality, which is why this rating gives 3 stars.  I didn't, however, care for the plot development, and while I never regret reading a book, I certainly won't be reading this one again.	2001-07-05

Full of the romance and mystery that we expect of her stories, Honest Illusions will be one of my favorites.  It is familiar in style to Private Scandals.<br />The story of a family full of deciet and magic will touch your heart.	2001-07-02

Grisham does a good job with character development through most of the story, and just when we are to meet a climax at the conclusion of the novel, he drops us off a cliff.  Imaginitive and realistic at the same time, The Testament will reinforce in your will the evil that money can cultivate.<br />All in all, not my favorite Grisham, but still worth the read.	2001-06-29

His writing is exceptional, and he applies it to a unique storyline, drawing in the reader until they are unaware that there is a line between real and make-believe at all.<br />While I wouldn't call this genre horror, I would perhaps call it a thriller.  It is the worst kind of fear that McFarland instills in us, the fear that any normal person can spuratically become un-ordinary, that something, anything can drive each of us over the edge.	2001-06-27

Koontz is a master in creating interwoven plot lines, complex characters and multiple crescendos.<br />From the Corner of His Eye is really a story about love and loss, death and rebirth... the way that all things are.  Koontz's take on the quantum mechanics of life is very interesting.<br />I'd recommend this Koontz book to everyone, a lifelong fan or a new reader.	2001-06-25

For those of you that have read Rivers End and enjoyed it, then you should like this one as well.<br />The story of a little girl, abused by her mother and rescued by her father is touching and incredibly emotional.  Roberts does an excellent job letting her readers grow up with Emma.  We see her for length at 6, 13, 18 and finally as an adult.<br />I thought it was amazing for Roberts to take on such heavy issues as repeat abuse patterns (in childhood and as adults), the ugliness of drug addictions, alcoholism, etc.  This was truly one of her darker books - but I would say one of her best.  A must read for any fan.	2001-06-19

While some of the scientific interludes were interesting, I felt that Koontz waited much too long to indulge his readers in the odd biological and scientific theories that make his novels so popular.<br />On a lighter note, I would say read the novel anyway.  We all have our favorites, and just because some of the reviews say it was not worth the read, doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it.  The story did have its highlights, and I found it entertaining - just no captivating.  Read it and make up your own mind.	2001-06-14

As someone very removed from the WWII generation, I found this compostion of heroics informational and emotional.<br />Portions of the writing were very cumbersome and heavy, so much so that I had to walk away from the book at times and pick it up again later.  However, I do think the entire book is worth reading.  I would suggest purchasing the book and reading it in bits and pieces.  It would be an excellent addition to anyone's book collection.<br />I think that while everyone should read this book, that everyone who knows a man or woman that came of age during WWII, whether fighting in Europe, Japan, or on our homefront, HAS TO.  It will, perhaps, lend meaning and purpose to our past, and shed a light in the direction of our future.	2001-06-12

As the depiction of the life of an average child during the tumultuous revolution in San Salvador in the 80s, Benitez combines the ability to remain non-judgemental with the innocence of a child.  She has thus created a story rich in emotion, but unbiased in fact.  In an attempt to remain bi-partisan, Benitez does her best to side with neither party in the war.  Instead, she sides with the nation's citizens, and against the war in general.<br />The Weight of All Things is ingeniously written through the eyes of a young boy;  A young boy who can see no evil government, nor the good in revolution.  A young boy who can only experience the loss of war, not its rewards.  His story is compelling enough to read the novel, but Benitez layers on top of emotion with vivid descriptions of the events in San Salvador at the time, and together, we as readers can feel the story-line unfold in our lap.  Rising as falling as Benitez commands.<br />The Weight of all things was a wonderful novel, and I can not wait to see Benitez' writing progress in future novels.  If for no other reason, read this book because it is refreshing and different from anything you've read.	2001-06-12

I thought it was wonderful.<br />The family Rogan has created is enchanting, and its character's emotions are as real as they come.  Jealousy, anger, mistrust;   So real and alive in all of us, we can not help but to bond with Rogan's creations. <br />Rogan has mixed together a little horror, a lot of suspense, and quiet a bit of love to make this novel come alive.  If this is a preview of her other works, I'll be sure to pick them up.	2001-06-07

The romance and suspense in her novels always keeps me up well past midnight.  However, this novel was somewhat different than the previous one's that I've read.  Perhaps it was the amount of gory murder, as another review said.<br />I really enjoyed the fact that Roberts could combine three stories into one book.  Its like a trilogy wrapped into one novel.  I would definantly recommend this to anyone who loves to curl up with an entertaining book.	2001-06-06

Her characters are origional and interesting, and her storyline drags you in until you can't put the book down.  I think it was well worth the read.	2001-06-04

It is well developed for almost liberal arts type reading, but I did not feel it served very well as a science and engineering text.	2001-04-09

For those Shreve fans that have already read The Weight of Water, this one is much, much better in my opinion.  For those readers that have not read the precurser - not to worry, you haven't a need to.<br />I was absorbed in Shreve's language in this novel, the poetic and sorrowful way she describes the love that Thomas and Linda could have had.  In the story of a love that could have lasted a lifetime, should have transcended time, Shreve is a magician.  She has you so enraped in the story, you don't even see the ending coming.  I had to re-read the last page 5 or 6 times, then look in the Weight of Water to reference whether or not her words are true.  The novel is beautiful and devestating all at once, and Shreve leaves us raw with the weight of what we have learned in The Last Time They Met.	2001-04-06

As a young woman, close to the author's age, I found her work surprisingly moving.  Her poems are an origional emotional barage, touching and full of sting, whitty and reflective, intelligent yet youthful.<br />I particullarly enjoyed the fact that the poetry seems to stem from all parts of her life: family, career, love, adolescence, childhood.  If you're looking for something fresh, this is a wonderful composition of poetry to pick up.	2001-03-29

Her descriptions of Ireland have the reader drawn there - dying to visit, entwined with the characters, and enraptured by their love.<br />This is one of my favorite Robert's trilogies - they're more enjoyable to read than isolated novels, and by the time you've completed the set, you feel as though you know the characters very well.<br />Another well done Robert's novel.	2001-03-29

If you're looking for a dark, insightful, depressing and yet hopeful story, We Were the Mulvaney's is a novel for you.<br />A coming of age story, for all the characters, We Were the Mulvaney's is a tribute to the fact that life goes on - whether we'd like it to or not, and certainly not in the way we'd expect it to.  A family struck by tradgedy deals with it in the only way they know how, and destroys itself in the process.<br />My only dislike in the book is the glossing over of a few of the characters.  We really only get a glimpse of the parents, their daughter, and one of their sons.  The other two boys seem to be inconsequential and I wish Oates would have expounded further on their lives after their sister is raped.<br />Overall, this was a wonderful book - definantly worth reading.  Oates draws us in and then crushes us, never quite regaining our trust, leaving us as exposed as her characters.	2001-02-20

Full of the romance and adventure that we all crave, Roberts never disappoints.<br />The story of two lovers, separated by lifestyles and oceans, who come together over a common dream and longing kept me up all night to finish the story.  It made me want to fly down to the Carribean, don some scuba gear and jump in.<br />Another great story from Roberts - I loved it.	2001-02-20

I was not at all disappointed by this earlier effort - I loved it!<br />Innocence, Mississippi is anything but that.  A serial killer has distraught the small town, causing even its women to take up arms... Caroline, a world famous violinist, has sought the town as a sort of reprive from her busy world.  A chance to settle back to earth.  Instead, she finds herself in the middle of a triple homocide, stalked by a killer, falling in love, and hopelessly content in this place she's beginning to call home.<br />Full of, but overly weighed down by love, Roberts also works more serious themes into the novel.  Abuse, alcoholism, infedelity and psychopathy make this more than a romance.  I stayed up all night to finish it.	2001-01-04

Woodiwiss is my favorite romance author and I love everything she creates.  The Flame and the Flower is no exception.<br />Heather is a wonderful character, as is Brandon, and I enjoyed the fact that we got quite a bit of background on the characters before they even meet.

Though I would recommend reading them out of order - The Flame and the Flower first, then A Season Beyond a Kiss, and this one last.  It will make more sense chronologically.<br />As for the story itself, I thought it was wonderful.  What I love the most about Woodiwiss' books is that you get to see the couples spend at least half of the book together, knowing that they love each other, instead of just the last pages.  I would highly recommend The Elusive Flame for both romance buffs and new comers.	2000-12-19

It has all the magic of a romance novel, the lust, anger, and surprising love, along with the comfort of characters.

As for suspense, I think we can all infer what happens throughout the novel in the first 50 pages of the book, but its the emotion and tenderness, not events, that Anita Shreve always instills in her books that makes them worth reading.  As with any of her storys, you become entwined with the characters, feeling their hurt, feeling their betrayal.  <br />And as with any good book, Shreve ends her stories leaving you with more questions than answers.	2000-11-20

From the tomboy to the anorexic, from the pudgy housewife to the car salesman, Landvik does an excellent job of slipping many small pieces of society into her work, each with its own cliches.<br />I thought her technique in allowning nearly all the characters to narrate was a wonderful idea, and really allowed the reader to get into the book, the minds of the characters and the author.<br />If you love a book that'll make you laugh and cry, than Your Oasis is on Flame Lake.	2000-11-10

What a mistake that was.  Eden Close is a beautifully written work, full of the intrigue and romance that Shreve is known for.  As always, she keeps us guessing right up to the end, and leaves us with a taste in our mouths for more.<br />Two childhood friends, on the brink of romance, find themselves there again nearly twenty years later.  Eden is blind, a result of a tragic shooting in her teen years, and together they must reveal what has been hiding in the darkness all these years.<br />Superb story, one of Shreve's best.	2000-10-23

A twist on the coming of age theme makes this book almost destined to become a classic.<br />The story of Astrid growing up and apart from her mother, Ingrid, is more than that.  Fitch exploits the fact that she places Astrid in one foster home after another, attempting to catch nearly every negative aspect of American culture.  Larger issues underlie the plot.  How to deal with alcoholism, religion, beating, predjudice, suicide, starvation, teenage pregnancy, and mostly, loneliness.  The average house from another perspective.<br />White Oleander is not a heart-warming story, but it is a soul touching one.  One of the best books I have read for some time.	2000-10-23

Predictable as it seems, it still touches your heart, this man and woman in love in the midst of the world's most horrific war.<br />The one true thing that the novel is lacking is detail about the war.  There were moments in the book where I was so swept away by the romance that I forgot there was even a war going on.  I think that Shreve could have done the events of the time more justice had she focused some on the concentration camps, the escape lines, etc.  The hardships of the time could have been more enhanced had they been compared to the complexity and horribleness of the events surrounding them.<br />Overall, it was a good book.  Especially if you like other Shreve novels, you'll like Resistance	2000-10-20

There is something that nearly everyone could identify with, whether it be the nationalistic pride felt by Leah's husband, the American arrogance displayed by Rachel, or the stuggle to fit in such as Adah demonstrates.<br />I would have to agree with another review that the last section of the book was slow and difficult to wade through.  Right as we are immersed into the adult lives of the three girls, Kingsolver belittles them next to the large historic events that have and are occuring in Africa.  And honestly, we are more interested in what is happening in the lives of the girls.<br />It was wonderfully encapturing.  I found myself loving and hating various characters in the book, so much so that I would have to force myself not to skip one section merely to read one written about the character I truly enjoyed.<br />From the jungle in which they are dumped to the Africa which will never truly escape them, these girls are a masterpiece which Kingsolver has created.	2000-10-13

And the events were touching as well, life and death, love and hate.<br />Its an enjoyable read, but seems to be lacking the emotional depth that would be needed to make this one of my favorites.  Don't expect to find yourself feeling overly sympathetic or in touch with the characters lives.	2000-10-13
US	50866529	R1B9XQLPFYS0DN	0446676098	430421115	The Notebook	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Notebook	Spark's has delivered another sweet and touching love story, wrought with the complications of life.  Obstacles such as family, time and disease must be overcome to unite these two lovers.<br />The Notebook is a lovely story.  I was particularly touched by the ending, while the two are now in a nursing home.  I think sparks shows an amazing understanding of alzheimer disease and demonstrates wonderfully the extreme difficulty in surviving a spouse who suffers from it.<br />A wonderful book to curl up with on a Sunday afternoon.	2000-10-09

The film ruined the novel.  Spark's created wonderful characters with Theresa and Garret, emotional, real people.<br />There's something about life that a book can capture that a movie can't, and its a person's thoughts.  Even if you've already seen the movie, read the book.  You'll understand the character's more, and their story.	2000-10-06

The story's plot could haveunfolded into a wonderful novel, it has all the characteristics of abeautiful love story, and I did admire the way that it seemed to sidewith no one; however, I felt that it was underdeveloped.  Just as weare beginning to get to know the characters the book is over.<br />Thinkwhat the author could have done if she had explored more indepthlywhat it was like to be Jane?  A homosexual woman living in such anera, in such a part of society where it would be so unacceptable.<br />Orperhaps Phillip.  Did he really love these two women?...Entertaining, but empty.	2000-10-04

I'm not sure whether we, as readers, are supposed to feel happy for Ruth and Amanda, content with their lives, or hate and despise them for the things they have done.<br />Christina Swartz has created a romance novel with none of the love, an action movie with none of the action.  It is unique to read, and still there seems to be something missing.  Perhaps it is empathy that we lack for the novel's characters.<br />Amanda is surely one of the most complex characters I have ever read.  She is simultaneously good and evil, love and hate, peace and anger.  She is difficult to grasp, impossible to curl your fingers around.  How many people have died because of her?  And yet none of these deaths seem to be her fault.  It is her character that makes the novel so intriguing, and the book worth the read.	2000-10-02

The story of two childhood lovers reunited after 31 years, finding the same passion that they felt at age 14 is almost surely to have concluded they way it did.<br />Sian is married with a beautiful girl, and Charles is married as well, with three children.  Yet they can not tear themselves away from each other, even to salvage the lives that surround them.  The love letters that the two recklessly divuldge in are perhaps what makes the story flow as it does, and Shreve does a wonderful job in noting the dates and times in the headings of them to demonstrate the ferosity of the two lovers.<br />I stayed up all night to finish reading this, just to see how it ends.	2000-09-29

It is by far the most emotionally indepth of her stories that I have read.  What truly makes Fortune's Rocks ingenious is that Shreve is able to make the reader whole-heartedly sympathize with the &quot;other woman.&quot;  It is quite in stark contrast with The Pilots Wife.<br />Fortune's Rock immerses into the lives of those whom we should hate, makes the reader wish for the impossible.  Shreve's insight into the heart and life of a woman who lives as Olympia lives, trapped in a love for a man that cannot be hers, is so on target one must wonder whether Ms. Shreve has lived such an experience herself.  One of the most excellent novels I've read in quite sometime.	2000-09-25
US	50866529	RFAH5SOF0D5ZG	0671024248	692650386	Hearts In Atlantis	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Not typical King	While this was far from my favorite King reading, I enjoyed the 5 stories that King combines in Hearts in Atlantis.  It was quite different from the majority of his horror novels, comparable to such works as Shawshank Redemption, but perhaps that is what makes it so interesting.  The story itself is slippery, quite cunning in fact, and I found myself unable to grasp it.  Everytime I thought I had a handle on the events and could predict what would arise with the turn of a page, the story would take a turn and slide out of my hands.   A wonderful book to take on vacation of for a weekend read.	2000-09-21
US	50866529	R3RMF0PTKEB3E7	0446608955	721431789	A Walk to Remember	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Innocence	Sparks is one of my favorite fiction authors and once again he produces a story that can touch a spot in every readers heart.  I sat, reading the  story and was suddenly back in high school.  I can remember the people that  were teased, remember my first crush, and the first time I truly fell in  love.  What makes this such a wonderful story is that as a reader, almost  everyone can relate to feeling a love as strong as these two characters,  and remorse at its loss.	2000-09-20

It is a story with an inevitable conclusion (a bit predictable) but so emotionally in depth that the plot seems to take a second seat to the overwhelming emotions felt by the characters of the play.<br />Following the death of her husband in a plane crash over Ireland, Kathryn finds herself suffering through grief and betrayl, mourning over the death of her husband of 16 years, a husband, she discovers, she knows virtually nothing about.<br />What makes this such a wonderful read, as with most stories, is that it makes you question your own life.  How well do you really know the people you share your life with?  Is it possible to trust someone?  Can you love two people at the same time?  All of these things roll through your mind upon the novel's conclusion, and your outlook on life and love will be inevitably changed.	2000-09-20

The main character, a long  abused wife and mother, flees with her adolescent son in the hopes of  putting her past behind her.<br />I found myself wondering if that is every  really possible.  The conclusion of the novel left me feeling jaded.  As a  society, we push the main character into her decision, which we claim is  the absolute correct one, and what happens?  Her world destructs.<br />Ms.  Quindlen did a magnificent job keeping us in touch with the hurt and pain  that comes with living with an abusive spouse, and the anguish and grief  that comes with leaving one.  Reading Black and Blue was truly an  emotionally educating experience.	2000-09-20

The plot, the characters, all of it.<br />Kerry, a college aged bisexual woman, finds herself falling in love with her somewhat twisted, beautiful, female roommate.  But after finding a dead body in the closet one morning, and its mysterious disappearance, their relationship evolves into something that is difficult for even the characters to understand.<br />The worst part of this book is that, as a reader, you can see the conclusion of the novel surfacing way, way, way before it does, and you are left to drag through the material until the story catches up to you, instead of the other way around.<br />It is, however, very interesting, liberal, and new wave.  I would suggest it to anyone looking for something different to read.	2000-09-20

This was not one of my favorite Shreve novels, perhaps because of its jumpy nature or bizarre ending, or maybe becuase I felt no empathy for the main characters.  However, no Shreve novel is without its strong points, and The Weight of Water is well worth the time to read.<br />Jean is a photographer on assignment to capture a deserted island known for its role in the history of an ancient murder.  Along with her husband, daughter, brother-in-law and his girlfriend, they spend an unforgetable weekend aboard a rather small vessel.<br />The end is shocking, and certainly not welcome, not at all what I was expecting to happen.  Perhaps this is Shreve's intention, for I'm sure the reader is left feeling reminents of the same feelings that Jean must have felt.  Overall, it was another wonderul Shreve novel.	2000-09-20
