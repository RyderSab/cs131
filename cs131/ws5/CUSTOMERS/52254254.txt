US	52254254	R3UYQPDXY3LKLC	0385006896	390250393	The Complete Sherlock Holmes	Books	5	9	10	N	Y	How not to be bored	Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential sleuth, is the invention of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  His clever exploits are (mostly) narrated by one Dr. Watson, an ingenious device to stretch out the reader's suspense.  The Sherlock Holmes mythos, if not \\"classic\\" or \\"great\\", is certainly one of the best- loved and read in English literature.  While I would not feel qualified to review the contents of the stories themselves (these works have outlived any of their contemporary critics), I can say that I prefer to collect stories I like in one anthology rather in bits and dribbles as dictated by some editor's preference.  Get the whole thing at once and be done with it!  It's not a small work (1000+ pages, which is heavy), but you won't get tired of reading about the Great Detective, even by the end.  Also, these are mostly short stories, written for periodicals, and lend themselves kindly to a daily commute on the bus.    I would finally point out that there has been a reissue of the same book, but with the font reduced to fit the entire work on about 500 pages.  A comparison between this book and the other shows a little more than 2 pages of this to 1 of the other; I personally would avoid the eye strain for the muscle strain and use the full-size edition.	2005-10-01

And some of those mysteries are genuine; that is, they cannot be explained by natural or normal causes, and something Outside must be the source.  As Machen said, some of these Outside causes are evil, just as we accept that there are mysteries of good as well.  Well, the Outside is ALL evil in this book.  Or perhaps no more evil than a wasp that lays its eggs in a grasshopper, waiting for its young to hatch and eat their way out...<br /><br />There are 6 scenarios in SACRAMENTS OF EVIL, all of them dealing with mysteries beyond our comprehension, the Outside that is inimical to us, and once it has found us it is too late to close our eyes and forget.  One is the story of an Outsider that switches minds from body to body, enjoying carnal pleasures and base passions before burning out a body.  And it plans to bring more like itself to this world.  In another, a family is cursed by the use of dark magic to overthrow a rival.  But now, that rival is the very agent of revenge about the descendants.<br /><br />A man who can truly be said to be \\"ill-conceived\\"  returns to the ancestral home.  Horror hangs about it like a palpable shroud, but what is the source?  Something, many things, move about, almost unseen, in the forest, but their true nature is more terrible and debased than any of the characters can imagine.  And then they meet Helen...<br /><br />Someone has begun a series of murders around a local cathedral.  The bodies are found missing part of the brain, but for what purpose?  There are worse things to be found in a cathedral than gargoyles, and this secret is definitely worthy of the title \\"sacraments of evil\\".<br /><br />Man knows so very little about the oceans and the deeps - what atavistic horrors may be dredged up from the depths, and how can they be escaped in the middle of the Atlantic?  Or is it worse to  bring the horrors home?  And speaking of the past, what would happen to a mind sent too far back in time?  Can a human mind contain the horror of non-existence?  Or might there be physical changes to accompany the mental disordering?  Or perhaps, something lies in wait, where the dimensions of time and space meet at shallow angles, something that seeks to destroy those traveling minds to satisfy needs and urges incomprehensible to those of us dwelling in the familiar curves of space?<br /><br />These mysteries, sacraments, of evil and Outside-ness pose challenges to the investigators that they MUST resolve.  Unfortunately for them, the end is only the beginning.of the title \\"sacraments of evil\\". <br /> <br />Man knows so very little about the oceans and the deeps - what atavistic horrors may be dredged up from the depths, and how can they be escaped in the middle of the Atlantic?

US	52254254	RCS9FXKDO6AKZ	0786926392	37402050	Call of Cthulhu (d20 Edition Horror Roleplaying, WotC)	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Librum Cthulhum Deetwentii	I had the Chaosium Cthulhu book for a few years when someone recommended that I get the WotC D20 Cthulhu book for additional ideas.  After buying and reading it, I feel that it stands well on its own.  So I won't be reviewing it in comparison to Chaosium's BRP book, or recommend which one is better, but just to review it as it stands. <br /> <br />First, the externals.  It is a nice book - a solid hardback, with art to look like a grimoire or other tome.  I like a sturdy rulesbook that structurally feels in flavor for the game it is made for.  The interior art is in color (!) and is mostly very good, with the chapter heading paintings looking particularly realistic.  The layout is readable, the paper feels dependable, and the page coloration changes subtly by chapter (for quick flipping).  In short, it looks and feels like a book you might like to own (sometimes I feel guilty about owning ugly books). <br /> <br />Next, I'll note that the mechanics are included.  That's good, because I don't intend to buy any more d20 products (wait, that's a lie.  I have already bought another d20 book to use with this one; I definitely wouldn't have if the d20 rules weren't spelled out).  Everything you need to know about generating a character, advancing in levels, acquiring skills, and combat is included (which I didn't necessarily expect when I bought it - I guess it's a true stand-alone).  It was difficult to sort through, and not terribly well organized.  I assume that the mechanics were squeezed in so that more could be spent on Cthulhu than on d20.  I did feel that my old AD&D 2E book was more clear (not saying the mechincs were better, just that I understood the presentation better after reading it).  Feats and skill ranks are new to me, so I can't really review that section other than to say that it's there.  I personally think that for all the rules, tables, and modifiers, the DM is just going to pick a dice check number that matches the difficulty he/she thinks the situations should have relative to your skill, so why bother with all the crunchiness?  But I'm not a big shot like Monte Cook or John Tynes, and this is d20, so I'll take their word for it. <br /> <br />Guns and other equipment is covered in excellent detail - nice to have it all in one place.   <br /> <br />Magic - tomes are covered very well, and even BRP Cthulhu people might benefit from reading the section on how sanity loss from reading Mythos books occurs.  Specific tomes are covered, along with all the spells from the BRP game.   <br /> <br />Creatures - all the major critters have entries.  I think the stats are a little silly, and not consistemt with descriptions or at appropriate levels relative to other monsters.  Also, given the deadliness of some monsters' descriptions, the challenge ratings seem much too low.   <br /> <br />The Mythos - the idea of Lovecraft's vision is explained.  Also, each decade is explained in terms of the progression of the End Times, and how each decade might be played along with movie and literature references that are appropriate for inspiration. <br /> <br />How to run a game - this is probably the most useful chapter in any game book I've ever bought.  There are 40 pages on how to create backstory, create good horror, keep a game going, and please your players.  I wish all gmaes came with this kind of explanation about what are the elements of a good game with lots of examples.  Even if you never play d20, this is great for any other horror game. <br /> <br />The two scenarios are well-designed with plenty of investigation that is also accessible to the players.  All useful details are included for what may be a first-time GM.   <br /> <br />At the back are a Monstrous Compendium of deities for use if you want in a D&D game.  I feel like they need to be in the book, and the stats hardly matter anyway.  There is also a conversion table for BRP and d20, as well as a bibliography of Cthulhu books to read. <br /> <br />Excellent presentation, excellent material, useful to more than just d20 players but contains everything needed to play d20.  An excellent buy for anyone in horror gaming, I think.	2005-09-10

Although, speaking of titles, I notice that Amazon has this book titled TALES OF CHIVALRY & ROMANCE (it should be DISCIPLES OF CTHULHU II).  Now that's truly awful. <br /> <br />There are a few stories in this collection worth mentioning.  \\"The Eldridge Collection\\" is about a future law enforcement agency fighting the supernatural, and some of its own agents use the supernatural.  Which sounds like a dumb idea for the agency.  Sadly, I found myself despising the characters, but the idea was an interesting one.   \\"Acute Spiritual Fear\\" was, quite frankly, blasphemous.  It gave me an idea of what HPL might have had in mind when he made oblique references to things better-not-mentioned.  \\"The San Francisco Treat\\" was an interesting glimpse into the mind of a madman.  His obsessive-compulsive disorder was very believeable, and it made me think of the weight I put on all of the superstitious behaviors I do. <br /> <br />I admit that I have read much better fan fiction, but then this isn't TOO bad.  But if I weren't a bibliophile, I think I'd rather not buy it.	2005-09-10

Fans of H.P. Lovecraft are, of course, familiar with such works as \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", \\"The Dunwich Horror\\", and \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\".  Then there are works that Lovecraft ghostwrote or revised (such as the famous collaboration with Harry Houdini \\"Under the Pyramids\\", or the stories collected in THE HORROR IN THE MUSEUM AND OTHER REVISIONS).  This book, THE LOVED DEAD AND OTHER REVISIONS contains some of Lovecraft's even more obscure revisions.  But, in the evolving self-referential universe based on the writing of Lovecraft, his contemporaries, and his followers, you will want answers to such questions as, \\"Who is Ghatanothoa?\\" and \\"What was the horror at Martin's Beach?\\". <br /> <br />Most of these stories are pulp magazine quality, with some winners and some forgettables.  There are 14 total: <br /> <br />\\"The Last Test\\" - similar to other Lovecraftian tales of cold science arrayed against humanity in the pursuit of knowledge.  See \\"Cold Air\\" and \\"Herbert West, Re-Animator\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Medusa's Coil\\" - this story has an excellent atmosphere of Southern decadence, an ancient secret kept alive by descendants of Atlantis, and a husband blinded by love.  Or, the cosmic secret could be some stupid bit of racism at the end.  I am marking out the las6 sentence so that it never mars my reading enjoyment again. <br /> <br />\\"Out of the Aeons\\" - I think that this story ranks up there with \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\".  An excellent mythology, some blasphemous relics from the ancient world, and a cult dedicated to their retrieval.  If only the dead could speak - but their eyes are bad enough! <br /> <br />\\"The Ghost-eater\\" - fairly standard pulp ghost story; good enough for what it is. <br /> <br />\\"The Loved Dead\\" - I was very surprised to see that this was influenced by HPL, but upon reflection, you can see his mark in the vocabulary and writing style.  I'm only surprised that I never noticed it before (I have this story in a collection of Weird Tales, attributed to CM Eddy).   <br /> <br />\\"The Tree on the Hill\\" - a story about the horrors of a tree, alone on a hill.  It doesn't sound scary, but Gothic houses are overdone.  I thought the author was up to the challenge. <br /> <br />\\"Till A' The Seas\\" - what will the very last day of humanity be like?  Before the Nuke, we went out with a whimper and not a bang.  The bleak nihilism in this story as the last of humanity passes away is almost cathartic.  I found it elegant (though not desirable!). <br /> <br />\\"The Night Ocean\\" - The sea has always held an attraction and a mystery to men.  Eternity and infinity lie in its deeps; the author posits that there may be more.  He has nothing more than half-glimpses and overheard mutterings, but he knows enough to know that he knows too much. <br /> <br />To the Lovecraft completist, these stories are necessary apart from their own merits, as part of the canon.  On their own, I think they make decent light reading with some highlights that will stay with you.	2005-09-10

The first thing I noticed about the collection SINGERS OF STRANGE SONGS is that it is edited by Scott David Aniolowski.  Right off the bat, this is a good thing.  Scott is a humble editor, not getting in the way of the stories themselves.  He doesn't endlessly expound on his own beliefs, nor does he give the ending away before each story.   This put me in a mood to better enjoy SINGERS OF STRANGE SONGS. <br /> <br />This collection is a celebration of Brian Lumley, who has made important additions to the Cthulhu mythos, although many consider his later work to be non-canonical.  Which is to say that his writing became less like HPL and more like a profitable author (here's to success!).  His early work involved mythos monsters (chthonians), mythos tomes (Cthaat Aquadingen), and mythos deities (Yibb Tstll, Shudde M'ell), so you can imagine that these stories explore those themes and devices. <br /> <br />Some of these are cthonian stories.  \\"Cement Surroundings\\", \\"Bad Soil\\", \\"Subway Accident\\", and \\"Shudder Wyrm\\", they're all about the burrowers beneath that come up to get you when you least expect it.  Although, sometimes they don't get ALL of you (some gets left behind).  This must have been a different experience before TREMORS was released.  These stories didn't feel very original after seeing the movie, but then I remember when I was terrified to ride the lawn mower because there might be giant worms underground ready to eat me (I am not very proud of myself right now). <br /> <br />A couple of stories deal somewhat tangentially with Yibb Tstll - \\"Not To Force the Rhymes\\" and \\"The Nullity of Choice\\" by John Tynes.  The former is a British-atmosphere story about saving the world.  I thought it would have been good but the author wanted to introduce the idea of a \\"gestalt\\" that had an avatar - that broke my suspension of disbelief.  Tynes story of a cultist trying to act out the perceived desires of his god was pretty goood, and filled me in on some aspects of YibbTstll I hadn't understood before.  I'd really like to read THE CALLER OF THE BLACK to better understand this part of the mythos, but &lt;heh>, good luck with that! <br /> <br />There were some other stories that dealt with tangential topics, some good, some merely okay.  My favorite involved the Men from Leng, Ithaquaa, and the Reliable Vacuum Cleaner.  The last story is a more obscure one by Lumley called \\"Spaghetti\\", and the atmosphere and buildup is great.  You KNOW that the \\"spaghetti\\" is going to be something awful.  Yeah, it was. <br /> <br />All in all, a good collection, some good authors, and a great editor.  I wouldn't pass this one up if you can get it.	2005-09-10
US	52254254	R4HYHCDJWF727	0933635559	312112785	Cthulhu by Gaslight: Horror Roleplaying in 1890s England (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, 1890s Era, #3303)	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Sourcebook for the Victorian Era	CTHULHU BY GASLIGHT is one of Chaosium's books that would benefit from a significant makeover.  It was difficult to rate because I believe it would have seemed a better quality product 17 years ago, but the field of role-playing games has matured and so has Call of Cthulhu.  Some of the material serves an outdated purpose, namely to get 1920s investigators into the 1890s; I suppose it was too radical to simply play 1890s investigators?  In any case, rumors are circulating that Chaosium plans to ravamp and re-release CTHULHU BY GASLIGHT, so hopefully the more dated elements will be replaced. <br /> <br />CTHULHU BY GASLIGHT started as a boxed set with a picture on the front of a gentlemen attacked by weeds.  The material came in the form of stapled booklets, along with maps.  The current incarnation (second edition) is a softcover book with color plates (if your plates are b/w photocopies and there is a lightning bolt by the UPC, you have a copy from Lightning Press.  My condolences).  This book serves to introduce people, places, and things from the Victorian era of England (primarily 1890s) to the Keeper.  There is also a single, longish adventure called \\"The Yorkshire Horrors\\", 1890s character sheets, and a London map. <br /> <br /> <br />Most of the material (besides the adventure) consists of articles on 1890s topics.  There is a short mention of the importance of social class, an update to the rules on professions, skills, and weapons, a short article on world affairs and events of each year from 1880 to 1900, and a series of short biographical blurbs on British citizens (emphasis on political and literary).  Then follows a long description of different places and things to see in London.  There are articles on crime, law enforcement, a GOOD article on Victorian occult organizations, and some miscellaneous stuff (see below on why the miscel. stuff is the MOST IMPORTANT SECTION).  There is a whole section on time travel (primarily to get investigators here) andanother section on Sherlock Holmes and the fictional characters of H.G. Wells. <br /> <br />\\"The Yorkshire Horrors\\" is a scenario that takes up half the book.  I thought it was an excellent adventure, involving Sherlock Holmes without his being the focus of the action.  There was plenty of period atmosphere, good Lovecraftian monsters, and good sleuthing (although it could easily become a party wipeout in a number of places - Keepers have to decide ahead of time if that is acceptable or not).   <br /> <br />CTHULHU BY GASLIGHT also has a number of drawbacks.  The very first is what I mentioned above; a section of miscellaneous facts in the middle of the sourcebook contains vital atmospheric elements.  Look; I don't know the difference between pounds, guineas, crowns, and sovereigns.  This is explained in the miscellaneous chapter, but not until you've slogged through half the book wondering how the heck you convert shillings to pounds and what's the funny notation?  Likewise, what's an inverness cape?  What's the difference between a duke, earl, and lord?  A lot of this was explained in the middle, but I really wanted to know at the beginning so that I could form a mental picture as I read.  Better organization would really have helped. <br /> <br />Also, the time travel chapter is pointless anymore.  So much space is spent on something that could be solved in one sentence, \\"Just play 1890s characters.\\"  If Chaosium really wants to leave in time travel, I would leave it solely as a plot device connected with HG Wells.   <br /> <br />Also, what's up with Wales and Scotland?  Heck, India, Afghanistan, or Hong Kong could stand a mention.  This is really about London and that's it.   Would have like to know more about the British Empire. Yes, I could google it, but if I'm doing all the legwork, why purchase the sourcebook? <br /> <br />While I am complaining, only one adventure is stingy by today's standards.  However, I'd hate to see \\"Yorkshire Horrors\\" removed to makeroom for three adventures in its place. <br /> <br /> <br />In summary, I think that CTHULHU BY GASLIGHT is a great resource on both London and Victorian era England for those who have none already.  A lot of important topics are covered, but not in the most useful order.  You'd also better like Sherlock Holmes.  Hopefully future editions will add more depth ot the period information as well as information on Britishness, reduce the reliance on Sir Doyle, and add an adventure or two.	2005-07-31
US	52254254	R2RHR0PGSA1QIQ	1568820690	35202310	The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep (Call of Cthulhu Role Playing Game Series)	Books	5	20	20	N	Y	The original "Pulp Cthulhu"	Many Call of Cthulhu gamers consider MASKS OF NYARLATHOTEP to be the ultimate Cthulhu product.  You might ask what is so great about MASKS?  Well, there are many reasons to like MASKS; it's versatile, non-linear, covers many interesting locations, has tons of clues and sleuthing to do, and from the Keeper's perspective, it has maps, handouts, spare cultists, monsters, traps, and side-adventures.  Something for everyone!  Plus, you get to fight just about everyone in the entire world. <br /> <br />MASKS OF NYARLATHOTEP started out as a boxed set, with stapled booklets for each location you visit.  And there are a lot: New York, London, Cairo, Kenya, and Hong Kong/Shanghai.  MASKS was reprinted as a softcover later, and then re-reprinted in the late 90's as THE COMPLETE MASKS OF NYARLATHOTEP - in this version, you also get the Australia chapter, which was cut from the original box and appeared in TERROR AUSTRALIS.  I'm not so keen on the Australia chapter; it seems unnecessary and doesn't add to the plot, but I'm glad it's in my copy.  That makes it COMPLETE! <br /> <br />The non-linearity is great, too.  So, you want to go to London from New York?  Sure, you could also go to Cairo instead.  Or Shanghai if you desire.  The players decide, and the order doesn't realy matter.  That is, how you play each chapter probably depends on what you already know, but there isn't a sequence that has to be followed.  That might worry a lot of gaming groups, so the Keeper needs to know whether his group needs strong clues to point the direction or whether they would enjoy exploring at their own pace. <br /> <br />You see, there are a lot of clues.  The COMPLETE MASKS helps you (the Keeper, not the player) by listing all the clues for a region at the beginning, why you would be pointed in that direction, and where they lead to.  Whoo, that's very helpful.  You'll have to read this book a few times before you see how all the clues fit together.  You don't need all of the clues either;many are redundant, or lead to side adventures, or to elements of the main plot that aren't essential.   <br /> <br />Speaking of side plots, just to really mix things up, each chapter has a diversion or two that investigators can get sidetracked on.  The side adventures in London are the best, and there is an hilarious one in Shanghai, but everywhere they give the players the option of false leads; not every clue is valuable and some should be ignored.  On the other hand, some subplots that seem inconsequential can offer up some serious clueage (is that a word?) for the next stage.   <br /> <br />Did I mention that you can fight a lot of cultists?  At the beginning, anyway.  By the end, we're talking thousands of armed loonies cheering on their dark lords.  By the final showdown, you may possibly even have an army and a navy to help (good luck with that, by the way).  Of course, you may decide that discretion is the better part of valor and hide in the shadows instead of gunslinging the cultist ceremonies.  And heaven help you if you open your eyes and watch.  Have you ever watched your electric meter while the AC is on?  yeah, that's what your sanity score is like, only in reverse.   <br /> <br />From the Keeper's point of view, MASKS has a lot of helpful elements.  Besides the previously mentioned clue cross-check at the beginning of each chapter, there are also stats for everything.  And if you need some extra cultists, there are extras rolled up.  Spare monsters?  They're there too.  Some Outer Gods to perform perverse and blasphemous rites?  They even have names and special powers.  Maps, clues, handouts, the works; it's all there.  Of course, your real task is coordinating investigators as they run clues to the ground.  Heck, you might even want to have a separate group for each chapter, and the survivors report back to HQ.  Just a thought. <br /> <br />Well, MASKS should provide both players and keepers with plenty of excitement and adventure.  Plenty of horror too.  Some images just keep coming to mind - like the exploding pregnant woman infested with the spawn of Nyarlathotep.  Ehhhh...  Good time for that lobotomy I keep putting off.  Good luck saving the world!	2005-07-31

Since the plot device is an object and not an event, it is much easier to insert these adventures into your game without outside connections; at least one, \\"Mr. Corbitt\\" (unrelated to a different Corbitt in a different house from the rulebook) has nothing to tie it down to any location.  It is, in fact, in your neighborhood!  Others, like \\"Plantation\\" and \\"Mansion of Madness\\" are tied to a particular region, while \\"The Sanatorium\\" is an island, but it could be off any coast.  So all the scenarios are really versatile, and can be inserted into almost any campaign or even be involved tangentially in a single adventure.<br /><br />The other distinguishing characteristic of MANSIONS OF MADNESS is that all of the adventures seem exciting.  That's right, ALL of them.  Usually you see one great, two good, and two filler.  And that's a good supplement.  No, all five of the scenarios in MANSIONS OF MADNESS look exciting and interesting.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Corbitt\\" - a non-descript man in a non-descript house in a non-descript neighborhood.  Except you happen to live there.  You might think that the exotic garden he keeps in the back is the plot hook - ala \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\".  If so, you'd be wrong . . . and maybe dead.  As a bonus, the crypto-cultist isn't intentionally evil; he's doing the best he can in a crazy situation.  One-D cultists are easy to dispose of; when the antagonist is a genuine nice guy, except for the whole \\"end-of-the-world\\" thing, it gets real interesting.<br /><br />\\"The Plantation\\" There's a cult, a sacrifice, and a cultist ringleader.  There's also an evil sorceress playing the cult for fools.  And she's not human.  And your friend (the good guy) wants to break up the cult so that he can start his own.  Oh yeah, there's a GOO involved here too, but he's on your side.  Of course, that's just as bad.  There's some serious layers to this adventure.<br /><br />\\"Cracked and Crook'd Manse\\"  It's the house man, it's the house!  Faster, investigators, kill!  kill!<br /><br />\\"The Sanatorium\\"  Okay, you're on an island for rest and relaxation.  Ha!  Investigators only get R&R when the Keeper secretly plans to kill them all.  Of course, you're trapped in an asylum on an island after a man is possessed and kills all the doctors.  So now you've just got crazies walking around.  What I particularly like in this adventure is that the investigators can restore order by giving medicines, continuing psychoanalysis sessions, etc.  Otherwise, the crazies all become level-up POW snacks for the bad guy.<br /><br />\\"Mansion of Madness\\" This is really a two part adventure, centered around a macguffin.  The fun part is all the bad guys losing their humanity to possess it.  This story is good and creepy in a lovecraftian way.

Of course, really driven people have neither the time nor the inclination to read a book on changing themselves.  Perhaps this is the kind of book you give away to people whom you think need it? <br /> <br />The author's premise is that if you don't develop inner discipline, you will eventually need it and discover that you lack it.  Even leaving aside traumas and disasters, the regular grind of day-to-day life will eventually expose you as a hollow man.  What to do?  Fill up your inside, which comes down to putting your heart, mind, and spirit into order.  If you don't have your own method, MacDonald suggests prayer, Bible study, journaling, and budgeting your time (not necessarily in that order).   <br /> <br />MacDonald describes the kind of person whom he believes needs to develop these disciplines: only gratified by accomplishment, seeks after the symbols of accomplishment, gets caught up in numbers, treats people like pawns or machines, are easily angered, very competitive, etc.  At first I said, \\"Ah, that's not me.\\"  Then it was, \\"Hmm, I guess I used to be like that, but I'm past that.\\"  In the end it became, \\"Yes, I've probably done all those things just this weekend.\\"  I had already been doing some of the disciplines he recommends, and since then I have begun planning my day each morning so that I can focus on the essentials and not get swept away with inconsequentials.  I may try journaling, but I'm not sure that it as great for everyone as the author implies. <br /> <br />In any case, it made me reflect on how I am running my life, which was the whole point of the book anyway.	2005-07-10
US	52254254	R96DO43B7INQR	1568821298	2718233	The Book of Eibon (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)	Books	3	16	16	N	N	From Clark Ashton Smith to Lin Carter	\\"The Book of Eibon\\" is a creation of Clark Ashton Smith, a member of the Lovecraft mythos circle.  Smith is probably one of THE best writers in this group; certainly, if you like Lovecraft then Smith will be a joy.  I wouldn't call him a Lovecraft devotee - he has his own style, for sure - but the two wrote stories that meshed well together.  Eibon was a wizard of an ancient continent, and his great and terrible magics have been handed down through the centuries via ... the Book of Eibon.  Naturally.  Well, Smith didn't develop this idea too far; his writing encompassed many fabulous periods, from ancient Hyperborea to medieval Averoigne, to dim and future Zothique.  All stories worth reading time and again. <br /> <br />As I said, Clark Ashton Smith did not develop the idea of Eibon and his black book very far.  Which brings us to Lin Carter (who did).  Now Lin Carter is not the absolute nadir of Lovecraftian prose.  Having studied the masters (and their voluminous written exchanges) he comes up with the occasional plot gem or turn of phrase.  But he is just so unbearably formulaic, adopting the atmosphere and elements of a Lovecraft or Smith but with no original spark.  It's like a well-oiled machine cranking out pastiche.  Carter is really not that bad, but a whole book of his work imitating someone else is wearying.  Probably his \\"collaborations\\" are the best, such as \\"The Light From the pole\\" and \\"The Stairs in the Crypt\\".  Also, to be as fair as possible, I believe that many of these stories originate in Carter's attempt to write and publish his own \\"Book of Eibon\\", which being intended for fans may have been intended as somewhat tongue in cheek. <br /> <br />Laurence Cornford has definitely written some of the better stories on this volume, particularly \\"The Demon of the Ring\\".  Cornford has his own style, which comes across as more authentic, with the subject material simply falling within the purview of this book. <br /> <br />Then there is the part of these books that I always dread - Robert Price's editorial comments.  Price happens to teach Biblical higher criticism and he works that fact into almost every editorial comment that he makes in every book that he edits.  I have been struggling to understand why this bothers me so much - finally I decided that it is because Price makes every editorial introduction about himself rather than the author or the material because everything is about Biblical higher criticism.  Normally, I would just say that I should skip reading the intro (especially since Price has a bad habit of discussing the ending of a story before you read it), but in this case I can't ignore it. <br /> <br />You see, THE BOOK OF EIBON is setup like a scripture.  There is a testament by the disciples of Eibon that the chapters to come are true.  There is a chapter of stories \\"by Eibon\\" on wizards before him.  There is a chapter of stories that deal with the doings of Eibon.  There are dark psalms (Richard Tierney seems to especially enjoy adapting Christian prayers into these), magic spells, liturgies to demons and gods, and some proverbs by Eibon.  There are some \\"epistles of Eibon\\" and even a section where Price \\"higher criticizes\\" an imaginary Eibonic text.  And all the way through, Price is doing his higher criticism thing.  Leaving out either Price or the \\"Bible\\" paradigm and THE BOOK OF EIBON could have been good.  As it is, it reads like self-conscious narcississtic glurge.  Which is sad, because clearly Robert Price is a great writer; I just don't understand why everything has to be forced through this lens of his own academic studies. The editor should really let the text speak for itself. <br /> <br />I am rating THE BOOK OF EIBON higher than I expected (3 stars) based solely on volume; there are over 30 short stories (plus other assorted \\"stuff\\") where a Chaosium book is usually 10.  So if some are not so great, you have more chances to get some good stories.  Laurence Cornford was good, inmy estimation, and \\"The Door to Saturn\\" by Clark Ashton Smith is included.	2005-07-10

I think a lot of Lovecraft fans can make the jump over to Clark Ashton Smith; Lovecraft used verbiage to invoke an atmosphere, while Smith used his to evoke sensations.  Neither one is stingy with their writing.  I have been a Lovecraft fan for years but was never able to appreciate Smith - his work is hard to find.  RENDEZVOUS IN AVEROIGNE collects representative stories from many of Smith's themes, perhaps as a sample of the Smith canon.  From ancient Hyperborea to watery Atlantis to medieval Averoigne to decadent Zothique, Smith's prose does not disappoint. But don't expect to read it quickly - good writing is dense writing. <br /> <br />There may be better collections of Smith's writings still available - if so, I haven't found them.  This collection has a real breadth of Smith's writing that isn't found in other collections; five different settings, and thirty stories total.  I waited almost 6 months to get RENDEZVOUS IN AVEROIGNE and it was worth the wait.  But I'd recommend that you get your copy while you can.	2005-07-10

Having had it recommended to me, and having been able to chase down a copy, I can say that the adventures look interesting, original, and well-researched, although somewhat primitive in their development.  I think all 6 of the scenarios would be fun to play or to run.  They can be run separately or as part of a continuous campaign. <br /> <br />\\"The Spawn\\" - The \\"Broad Vein\\" and \\"Copper Lady\\" are adjacent mines in Coppertown, NM.  One is producing loads of rich ore, and the other is losing money.  But it might surprise you at which one the miners are given easy hours and high pay.  It certainly surprised IWW, the big union of the 1920s.  When one of their undercover agents is killed, the other  calls on the investigators for help.  There's more than one way for them to discover what lurks at the bottom of the mine, and at least one involves them not leaving again. <br /> <br />\\"Still Waters\\" - Many investigators are book hoarders or bibliophiles, always trying to get a leg up on the next tome.  They are supposed to meet fellow enthusiasts to look at a unique tome, but the family has disappeared.  Clues lead to an archrival, a mask covering a horrible face.  Talk about not judging a book by its cover ... <br /> <br />\\"Tell Me, Have you Seen the Yellow Sign?\\" - Being a King in Yellow afficionado, this scenario really appealed to me.  Plus, it is set in Mardi Gras.  How fun!  And as we all remember, New Orleans was the site of the last victory against the Cthulhu cult.  Perhaps there is more here than meets the eye? <br /> <br />\\"One in Darkness\\" - The baddie you have to fight here is a god.  Good luck! <br /> <br />\\"The Pale God\\" - What an opening scene - describing it would take away some of the punch from playing the scenario, but if you know Ramsey Campbel then you know what is coming.  Most creepily, the little white things are everywhere throughout the scenario -How exactly do they infect and infest?  This could lead to some brilliant paranoid roleplaying. <br /> <br />\\"Bad Moon Rising\\" - The first half of this scenario is an excellent conspiracy game.  I'd move the time forward some and use it as a Delta Green scenario; maybe set in the 1940's when it was OSS, or maybe early 50s when it was still legal.  The British Navy is hiding something, a secret installation that has already cost the lives of four men.  Can the investigators get in on the action?  They'll have to be practically black ops to do so, but the rewards are worth it. <br /> <br />There is a distinct second half of this scenario that the keeper might want to adjust.  Whether it should be a dream, or shared delusion, or some twisted reality, I don't know, but it doesn't seem to fit witht he first half.  Maybe just run the first half without the second?  Actually, with a different introduction, the second part could stand on its own. I have the feeling that the latter was added to the former for the purposes of having a GOO (and thus being appropriate for inclusion). <br /> <br />Well, THE GREAT OLD ONES definitely has some great material.  It has plenty of convoluted plots, deadly encounters, and chances for players to show their stuff.  I think keepers will also have to develop some of the empty space on their own, depending on their players.  Well, roleplaying should be fun for players and keepers too.	2005-05-30
US	52254254	R2534JYHHXEFM0	0933635915	635722912	Call of Cthulhu Non-Mythos: Blood Brothers 2 (Chaosium Book No. 2340)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Faux Horror	BLOOD BROTHERS2 is designed to be a collection of one-night-stands for the game Call of Cthulhu.  The gimmick of BLOOD BROTHERS2 is that it has no Mythos, no Cthulhu, no Lovecraft.  It is roleplaying of horror movie archetypes, from silent pictures to teenager beach movies to zombie flicks.  Each adventure is really theater, with characters and a script.  Some might find this confining, but I think it is an intriguing alternative to standard Call of Cthulhu.  Each scenario even comes with a sketched poster and a \\"trailer\\".  BLOOD BROTHERS2 seems intent on producing a more campy atmosphere than genuine horror, although I suppose an experienced keeper could make it go either way.  I certainly found some of them too amusing to not play. <br /> <br />Some of the highlights: <br />\\"Nightmare in Silence\\": this is a silent picture.  The characters don't speak (of course, the players may, but only in describing their actions or thoughts).  Minimal dialogue is done with cards. <br />\\"An Alien Kicked Sand in my Face\\": Teenager beach movie.  I think this would end up played as a farce, when evil aliens come to take over the world by assuming the form of lustful teenagers. <br />\\"El Tigre\\": Masked wrestlers fight alien invaders on the moon after being kidnapped by female Nazis.  This explains itself. <br />\\"Carnival Knowledge\\": Think \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\".  This is the only one I actually found scary - I think it would  make great horror as opposed to the campy theme of the whole book. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought the campy stories would be fun to play.  I mean, who could pass up a chance to play a masked wrestler?  Many groups might enjoy the opportunity to go beyond the somewhat formulaic, albeit well-appreciated, storylines that Call of Cthulhu traditionally presents.  That said, I wouldn't want to play BLOOD BROTHERS2 every night, but as I said before, it would make a great diversion.	2005-05-30

Published in 1987, CTHULHU NOW allowed players of Call of Cthulhu to run games in the present.  At the time of this writing, that was 18 years ago.  It feels less current and more ... nostalgic (?) to me.  Of course, Delta Green is 10 years old now and there's been a lot of water under THAT bridge.  Still, 1987 is more like \\"now\\" than it is like 1927, so I believe it still has value as a modern gaming supplement (some things, like weapons and science, haven't changed that much.  The Internet and technology has).  Of course, maybe you'd just like to play an 80's game - in that case, bring on the retro! <br /> <br />CTHULHU NOW has some great articles on forensics, weapons, and modern skills, equipment, and money.  Fortunately for players, this has largely been included in the main rulesbook; of course, that reduces the need for this sourcebook.  There are also 4 adventures included - \\"The City in the Sea\\", \\"Dreams Dark and Deadly\\", \\"The Killer out of Space\\", and \\"The Evil Stars\\".  There is also a section of tear-out handouts (which I think is an improvement over breaking your book's spine to photocopy pages) and a 1980's investigator's sheet (which is now in the core rulesbook and also available with the Byakhee software). <br /> <br />The articles: <br />Modern investigators: If you have the core rulesbook, you don't need this at all.  If you want to run an 80's campaign, it could be handy.  The problem with it is that it details costs and equipment availability.  There's been a lot of inflation since then, but surprisingly new technology has seen a lot of deflation, so that it would be impossible to \\"project\\" prices into the future (for things that players don't already know the price of - say, night-vision goggles).  I guess the authors could not have forseen just how available technology would become in our day.  Reading anything on computers is a little amusing. <br /> <br />Forensics: This is the best article on forensic pathology that I have read - both techniques and their development over time.  A great article - on the other hand, you could do well enough for a game by watching a season of CSI.   <br /> <br />Weapons: Again, a great article on modern guns, their characteristics, availability, and use.  Again, much of this has been reprinted (particularly in D20 CTHULHU, which has a whole chapter in exquisite detail).   <br /> <br />The adventures:: <br />The first one, \\"The City in the Sea\\", was a wash for me.  Not particularly excited about it - it could have been set in any time period as far as I could tell (even a \\"Jules Verne\\" version of Gaslight).  An investigator gets sent an idol from a deceased uncle - haven't seen that one before.  The second, \\"Dreams Dark and Deadly\\", is set in a lodge turned into research station.  Dreams are studied using a supercomputer recording electrical signals.  Perhaps it was science-fiction at the time, but it sounds exciting in the modern day to me.  Very believable, could be well adapted to the 90's or even today. \\"The Killer out of Space\\" is about an alien that causes a space-shuttle to crash, bringing its infection to Earth.  Some have said this could be in bad taste after the Columbia disaster. I think it could also be very apropos, depending on your players. \\"The Evil Stars\\" is a about a rock band bringing Hastur to Earth - at first glance I thought \\"That's so 80's.\\"  You could change the superficials - rock band to grunge or death metal, particularly, and still have a good modern scenario.  Some scenarios are a prisoner of their times, but I think this one has an enduring core idea. <br /> <br />In summary, I think this is a good product for its times.  Much that was good has been incorporated into the core rulebook, but the weapons and forensics articles are handy if you don't have them somewhere else.  Three of the four adventures looked good and accessible to any \\"modern\\" period - 80's, 90's, or post-millenium.  These scenarios shoudl be particularly good in conjunction with Delta green, but then again, what isn't? <br />	2005-05-29
US	52254254	R5NVS14GBTICT	1568821727	359047032	The White People and Other Stories: Vol. 2 of the Best Weird Tales of Arthur Machen (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)	Books	5	36	36	N	Y	Volume 2 of Arthur Machen's work	I was vary impressed by Chaosium's first collection of Machen's work, which was THE THREE IMPOSTERS AND OTHER STORIES.  \\"The Three Imposters\\" was a narrative of interwoven tales describing a paranoid man's encounter with three people who are not who they seem.  Each is an excellent story in its own right, but the whole is greater than the sum.  Considering the success of the first volume, I decided to try the second. <br /> <br />If you don't know Arthur Machen, he wrote \\"weird\\" stories in the late Victorian - Edwardian period.  They all have a distinctly British flavor that reminds me of M.R. James.   Most of his stories are set in his homeland of Wales, where something of charm and magic remains beneath the hills.  By necessity he began to write for a newspaper later in life, and a fictional account he wrote for the paper on spectral guardians for British troops in WWI became the \\"Angel of Mons\\" stories you can still read about today. <br /> <br />THE WHITE PEOPLE AND OTHER STORIES is an eclectic collection of Machen's weird stories, his poetry, and some of his later writings for newspapers.  Despite being a fan of Lovecraft, I have always wondered what HPL meant when he consistently referred to a protagonist hinting at things unknown (to others), dropping outlandish names and meaning more than is said.  Well, he borrowed this technique from Machen's \\"The White People\\", a story made to look like a young girl's diary.  Her journal is just a collection of thoughts and experiences, and many things are hinted at as reminders to herself which we will never understand, but these brief glimpses are horrible enough.  Machen's poetry collection, \\"Ornaments in Jade\\", also struck me as weirdly beautiful but also indecipherable.  More is unsaid than said, hinted at than revealed.  I felt that it relied on some code, a common frame of reference, that has been lost over the course of a hundred years.  Perhaps his contemporaries felt the same way. <br /> <br />There are other interesting compositions in this volume.  \\"The Red Hand\\" brings back the investigating protagonists from \\"The Three Imposters,\\" with a not-too-dissimilar plotline. \\"A Fragment of Life\\" seemed to be a glimpse into the everday life from a time long ago.  It is almost novel length and simply describes the common affairs of a couple in turn-of-the-century London.  If this sounds uninteresting, you'll have to read for yourself how a masterful author makes common situations uncommon.  Finally, there are a series of stories written from Machen's journalistic days.  Besides a group that are all related to the \\"Angel of Mons\\" category, there are a few others that describe other supernatural phenomena and are written in the first-person.  They are so straight-forward and sincere that sometimes it is difficult to remember they are meant to be fiction. <br /> <br />Machen's overarching theme is that the material, everday world is merely a shadow of reality and that true living must penetrate that shadow to see the glories beyond.  This is something he truly believed and it is evident in all of his stories.  The reason these stories continue to frighten and thrill is that we desire to see what is beyond the veil, but we are also afraid of what we will find. <br />	2005-04-16

Lovecraft's Arkham: Unveiling the Legend-Haunted City (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying, Chaosium # 8803)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Sourcebook for a city of shadows	First, let me say that this is a huge book.  At 250 pages, you are really getting your money's worth.  The town info is great, lots of useful characters, and the scenarios are excellent.  I do have some complaints - the layout is more primitive than the other books, especially the neighborhood maps.  On the other end of the scale, all the portraits are computer generated.  First, it looks pretty hokey (maybe CGI was not as good back then?); second, the facial proportions are wrong for many of the people.  This isn't a big deal for, say, Dunwich, but Arkham is somewhat repesctable and misproportioned faces just clashes with the attempted realism of CGI. <br /> <br />The standard layout of these books is to have a story by HPL featuring the town, to discuss town history, to break down the town into neighborhoods and show each one in detail, and then to have scenarios. <br /> <br />The opening story is \\"Dreams in the Witch House\\", which is probably the best available.  I really like opening these books with a story by HPL - it is a reminder of how the whole thing got started.  The neighborhoods take up a lot of space and describe a great many people, places, and things to meet in Arkham.  I wish they would have spent some time talking about architecture in the town history section - I still don't know the difference between \\"gable\\" and \\"gambrel\\".   Some real problems: street names are not clearly marked on the neighborhood maps, even when they are referred to.  The combined map is not reprinted in the neighborhood section, nor is each neighborhood map shown as one piece; we only see fragments at a time.  I think the Kingsport sourcebook does this best, so I assume that the layout people were still pefecting their craft at this early stage.  As always, the town directory is helpful considering especially that there are so many entries that an index is needed to quickly find anything.  All of the scenarios are great, although one (\\"the Hills Rise Wild\\") really would havebeen better in the Dunwich book, which was short on good scenarios.   <br /> <br />Also included is a tear-out map of Arkham on very nice paper, and an issue of THE ARKHAM ADVERTISER, which also becomes a handout.   <br /> <br />In all, this is a very informative sourcebook, with plenty of people, places, and things for investigators to explore.  The only drawback, besides the poor maps, is that the spooky atmosphere was not convreyed very well.  Reading the other sourcebooks, I definitely felt the atmosphere; Arkham didn't do that for me.  It could have been better, but was still great.	2005-04-16

There is no point to my going through the listing and mentioning which stories are my favorites; they are all excellent (or at least important).  Collecting the out-of-print books that contain these stories individually would cost hundreds, even when searching for the most recent reprint, so this is quite a valuable addition to your library (although you may wish later to read more by the anthologized authors).  The authors below are representative of the pool of literature that Lovecraft drew from for his own stories, his contemporaries who collaborated with him, his post-humous successors, and people like Stephen King who were motivated to begin a career from reading HPL's work. <br /> <br />\\"The Return of the Sorceror\\" and \\"Ubbo-Sathla\\" by Clark Ashton Smith <br />\\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\" and \\"The Space-Eaters\\" by Frank Belknap Long <br />\\"The Black Stone\\" by Robert Howard <br />\\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" by Lovecraft <br />\\"The Dweller in Darkness\\" and \\"Beyond the Threshold\\" by August Derleth <br />\\"The Shambler from the Stars\\", \\"The Shadow from the Steeple\\", and \\"Notebook found in a Deserted House\\" by Robert Bloch <br />\\"The Salem Horror\\" by Henry Kuttner <br />\\"The Terror from the Depths\\" by Fritz Leiber <br />\\"Rising with Surtsey\\" by Brian Lumley <br />\\"Cold Print\\" by Ramsey Campbell <br />\\"The Return of the Lloigor\\" by Colin Wilson <br /> <br />The last 5 are farther removed from Lovecraft; probably the best is Stephen Kings' \\"Jerusalem's Lot\\" <br /> <br />More interesting than my opinion on the stories included is those left out; nothing is said of those authors wholly predating Lovecraft but who significantly influenced him.  There is no Lord Dunsany, no Arthur Machen, and most signifcantly no Robert Chambers (and his King in Yellow, which seems to have been the archetype for Lovecraft's Necronomicon).  I mention this merely for completeness' sake; this is a superb collection.	2005-04-03

Lovecraft's Dunwich: Return to the Forgotten Village (Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying, 8802)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A Resourceful Resource	Having already read \\"Escape from Innsmouth\\" and the Kingsport Sourcebook, I read this book less charitably than I might have when it was first released.  The characters of Dunwich all seem the same - poor, widowed, incestuous, abused, etc.  After reading the hundredth entry on a family, I began to feel that it would be less tiresome to simply state that people there are backward, miserable, and degenerate.  But then, why would you need a sourcebook? <br /> <br />There are many things to like about the Dunwich sourcebook, though.  The secrets from beneath the earth are revealed, and they are good ones.  Characters and history are well fleshed out, and the local cult (there's one in each city, it seems) is very believable, for a change.  Actually, I think the cult might be the best part of the source material.  It's just that, having effectively convinced me that the whole area is grubby,  backward, and degenerate, I don't really want to run characters there long term.  But then I would only need a scenario pack and not a sourcebook.   <br /> <br />If you're not familiar with the format of these books, they begin with the source material from HPL (in this case, \\"The Dunwich Horror\\").  This is a great idea in my mind, as it is a reminder of why you're reading this in the first place, and how to use it in a story.  Town history is related, as well as an explanation of the local cult.  Then, the region is split into areas which have detailed entries on the people, places, and things found in each section.  This allows a large amount of information to be presented without overwhelming the reader by \\"chunking\\" the info.  Also, it gives each reason its own flavor, and emphasizes the differences between parts of the Dunwich valley.  The town is its own entry, and the environs are the rest of the chunks.  There is also a substantial amount of info on the underground of Dunwich. <br /> <br />The scenario section is somewhat thin.  One scenario is \\"The Dunwich Horror\\", but other than stats nothing is added to Lovecraft's story, related in the first chapter (at least you're not paying for redundant material).  There is a \\"Return to Dunwich\\" which has a similar feel.  \\"Earth, Sky, Soul\\" is a very different kind of scenario (really a scenario seed) that might lead to more terrible explorations underground. <br /> <br />There is also a chapter on legends, rumors, and plain old gossip.  I think this is an excellent addition, as this is one of the primary ways for investigators to get clues.  Including false leads just makes everything more intriguing. <br /> <br />This is probably the weakest of the Lovecraft country sourcebooks (not scenario packs), but that still leaves Dunwich in high quality.  I don't know that it has as much potential for a campaign setting as Kingsport or Arkham, but you should still find it extremely useful in plotting adventures in Lovecraft country. <br />	2005-04-03

Lovecraft's Dreamlands (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying)	Books	4	18	18	N	Y	Complete Indeed	This hardback copy of HP Lovecraft's Dreamlands is an improvement over the 4th edition.  Previously removed adventures were restored, with Lovecraft's original conception of the land of Xura.  It still has Lumley's description of Zura and the Eidolon Lathi, which many people resented.  I just found it interesting that the scenario involving Xura (not Zura) admits that the decription is different from the one in the sourcebook, but was still worthy of inclusion. <br /> <br />To begin with, it is a nice hardback book.  I like my source books to be hardcover for more use.  I tend to mangle softcovers that are used a lot for reference.  There is a nice color landscape on the inside covers. However, all other graphics are black and white, which at least cost less.  Some of the pages weren't bound well either. <br /> <br />The material begins with a description of dreaming, the land of dream, and how to get there.  This edition says that in order to enter through dreams, characters must have less than 300 points of modern skills (science and technology); they can still enter via other methods (artifacts, magic, and chemicals).  The dreaming skill is described, which allows MP and POW to be used to alter reality within the dreamlands. <br /> <br />The next section is a paraphrase of \\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\\".  I assumed it would merely leave out some prose from HPL, but it also includes further information on each of the areas that Carter visited - very informative and fun to read!  The Gazeteer of the Dreamlands follows, which divides the world into the North, East, West, Seas, Oriab, the Moon, and the Underworld.  I didn't feel that these sections were well-developed; it was almost just a list of places and people.  It really would have been more productive to focus on a few sites of interest and add more background to those than do a lukewarm job on all of them.   <br /> <br />Afterwards, there are sections on people, creatures, and gods of the Dreamlands.  These are mostly complete, but the major races and gods ere only references to read the core rulebook.  I would have preferred to see the entries repeated than have to pull out another book for the most important denizens of the Dreamlands.  There are also artifacts, books, and many spells - the magic of the Dreamlands is much more powerful in its ability to warp \\"reality\\".   <br /> <br />There are then 6 scenarios presented.  The first is two pages, and really just a suggestion to travel through the Dreamlands to meet a friend - big whoop.  This is a \\"seed\\", not a \\"scenario\\".  \\"The Land of Lost Dreams\\" and \\"Season of the Witch\\" are powerful narratives with physical and psychological challenges for investigators to overcome.  \\"Pickman's Student\\" is a horrific transformation of a friend into a fiend from the Underworld, requiring a travel to the Dreamlands to gain assistance to end the change.  \\"Lemon Sails\\" seems like a fun adventure for Dreamlands-only characters, although the plot is forced. <br /> <br />One huge point in favor of this book is a section on creating a dreamlands character, with rolls, skills, and a character sheet.  There are occupation skill sets listed and weapons more common to dreams.  This allows the Dreamlands book to be used as a standalone, which I think adds a LOT of value.  There is also a bibliography of authors and stories referenced in the dreamlands - a great reading list! <br /> <br />I think this book has some weak points - a lot of names of cities and people, but not much info.  Clearly, this allows the Keeper to improvise a lot, but then if you wanted to do that, why buy the sourcebook?  But there is a lot to approve of - the restoration of all the scenarios, the acknowledgement of the difference between Lovecraft and Lumley on some points, the rules for creating a character so that this supplement can be a standalone, and, well, the hardcover itself.  Might be worth upgrading if you own 4th edition, otherwise a good buy for anyonenew to dreams.	2005-03-19
US	52254254	RR6W4MU1MWBOU	0886777224	127607663	Miskatonic University	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A summa cum laude collection	Like a previous reviewer, I expected this book to be an anthology of Lovecraft pastiches.  Hey, I like them as much as the next guy, but yet another collection of pastiche is nothing to get excited about.  I was excited to see a set of stories set in Lovecrafft country, using some of his caracters, places, and books, without necessarily trying to imitate his writing style.  The book starts out with a real kicker, \\"Kali Yuga Comes\\".  Even though it is set in the middle of a series, I was immediately hooked on the intensity of the story and plot device of the return of Kali.  Why invent space aliens and impronouncable gods when we have an easily accessible mythology with fanatics and a cult broken up only a few generations ago?  And why Kali is there is the real kicker... <br /> <br />\\"Her Misbegotten Son\\" is an excellent novella - I was really wound up with the characters.   It's been a long time since a mythos tale sucked me in this hard.  I know the author has done a superb job when I have to check how the story ends before reading the middle because the tension is unbearable.  <br /> <br />\\"To Be As They\\" is a vignette showing the relationship between a master's candidate and her advisor when an unusual artist paints an unrequested portrait.  The fate of the two lovers is only hinted at, but is both grotesque and repulsive.  There are so many ways that this story could have been done wrong, but the character interactions were pulled off masterfully.  Much better work than I expected in this kind of collection. <br /> <br />\\"The Sothis Radiant\\": as was mentioned before, this is an excellent story.  This is what cosmic horror would look like in our day.  It's the end of the universe - in slow motion.  But not slow enough.  After reading this story, I had to put down the book and stare into space for awhile. <br /> <br />\\"The Play's the Thing\\" and \\"Ghoulmaster\\" just tickled my fancy.   <br /> <br />As I said before, the strongest aspect of this collection is taking aLovecraftian setting and doing whatever the author wants in that universe.  Many authors want to write like Lovecraft without understanding what really makes his stories hold together.  I have much rather enjoyed seeing Miskatonic University explored in the style of each individual author.  I can't recommend this collection highly enough.	2005-03-19
US	52254254	R1QC8LS7H5ZD9X	1568821670	459074839	H.P. Lovecraft's Kingsport: City in the Mists (Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying, 8804)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	A well-written and evocative sourcebook	Lovecraft is, I think, best known for his adjectives.  More than Cthulhu, even than the Necronomicon, Lovecraft distinguishes himself by a flood of adjectival description for every object, person, landscape, and sensation.  The effect is hypnotic, causing the reader to feel immersed in the actual location.  I have always thought of Dunwich's adjectives as grubby, ramshackle, and decayed; for Arkaham, I think of dark, secretive, ancient, and haunted.  After reading the Kingsport sourcebook, I have an even stronger feel for that location: quiet, contemplative, shrouded in mystery.  The rhythm of wave and tide pacing the flow of time from one generation to the next.  The ubiquitous mists sheltering the town from the march of progress, allowing memories to accumulate.  It seems like the perfect location for an ancient mystery to resurface. <br /> <br />One excellent aspect of the Lovecraft country books is the inclusion of at least some of Lovecraft's original stories dealing with the town - that is why we're here, after all.  Kingsport's stories are \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\" and \\"The Festival\\".  I would have also liked to see the inlcusion of \\"The Terrible Old Man\\" as well as \\"The White Ship\\", but that might conceivably be giving away too much.   <br /> <br />There follows some short sections on what life is like in Kingsport, the history of the town, and the low-down on the local cult (which I thought was pretty good). Afterwards is the standard breakdown of the locale into neighborhoods/regions.  Each section lists any interesting residents, locations, and any useful items or information located there.  I find this to be an excellent inspiration for ideas.  If you are not completely into one-shots, an excellent long-term idea would be just to explore the town, investigating history and mystery.  I know that my gaming group actually likes this sort of thing better than epic quests and whatnot.  I also really like the town directory, sorting people, places and things into categories for easy reference with their page number. <br /> <br />About half of the book is scenarios.  There is a short section on how to use character dreams during gameplay and then 3 scenarios.  I really can't say much about them without being a spoiler.  I can say that \\"Dead in the Water\\" has a lot of material and looks very intense and draws out many of the unique characteristics of Kingsport.	2005-03-19
US	52254254	R22NTY8N0OKATF	1568821247	211426626	The Ithaqua Cycle: The Wind-Walker of the Icy Wastes (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Also known as the Derleth Cycle	If you are reading this right now, you owe August Derleth a debt of gratitude.  That is, if you enjoy Lovecraftian fiction, it is probably due to Derleth's efforts to keep it in print and widely read.  This is certainly an inestimable service and one for which I appreciate him greatly.  <br /> <br />His writing is another matter entirely. <br /> <br />This collection starts off with one of the best weird stories ever, \\"The Wendigo\\" by Algernon Blackwood.  A deadly creature in the Canadian hinterland issues a siren call, summoning those who hear it to run alongside it in the air, and in the process, stealing the hearer's humanity.  This concept is brought to life by atmospheric detail and ruminations on the cowering of men's souls when confronted with the vastness of the unknowable North.  This is a masterpiece, recognized even by HP Lovecraft himself. <br /> <br />The next three stories are Derleth's work.  Perhaps something about the Wendigo legend caught his fancy - perhaps he just saw an opening to be exploited.  In any case, he created a mythos deity \\"Ithaqua\\" to be part of the Lovecraft pantheon that would fulfill the duties of the wendigo spirit.  His first two stories in this book are the same, \\"The Thing that Walked on the Wind\\" and \\"The Snow Thing\\".  They deal with \\"cultus interruptus\\", intruding on a deity's private worship and incurring that wrath.  But of course, the trespasser has enough time to write a testimony before being gathered into the great beyond.  These are certainly not his worst work; \\"Beyond the Threshold\\" would give that title a run for its money.  Derleth descends to a new low in pulpishness while shilling for his own publishing press - THE OUTSIDER AND OTHERS is mentioned along with fan-favorite mythos tome THE NECRNOMICON as a source of forbidden knowledge.  Why?  Because Derleth was trying to sell his own press's copies!  Well, a guy's gotta make a buck... In both this and \\"Dweller in the Darkness\\", Derleth shills his own books withinthe story and alternates between mythos baddies Ithaqua and Nyarlathotep as the actual source of the evil occurrences.  As editor Robert Proce points out, many of Derleth's stories seem to be put together post haste as if he couldn't decide which Lovecraftian qualities to throw into the story.  The collection would have been better selecting only the first Ithaqua story and just making an apology for Derleth and moving on. <br /> <br />That being said, the rest of the book, which builds on the foundation Derleth erected, is pretty good.  Lumley has an entry \\"Born of the Winds\\", which is a rewrite of Derleth's original Ithaqua atory but with real character this time.  Although the outcome was inevitable, I found the story engaging.  \\"Spawn of the North\\" is a wendigo story involving a mountain man and a Texan in the Yukon, executing frontier justice against a corrupt mining company and trying to escape the bounty on their heads.  In \\"Jendick's Swamp\\", Ithaqua is an Indian wind god without the arctic connotations, allowing the story to be set further south.  This one was entertaining if for no other reason than variety.  There are a few other stories with the same idea (Ithaqua as wind god), one involving an occult society and one with WWI fighter pilots. <br /> <br />Excepting only Derleth, the tales in this collection are quite good, with a variety of characters, locations, and motivations (and I'll even grant that Derleth's first was seminal).  Robert Price's notations were also valuable in helping to understand how Derleth wrote, which was interesting in itself.  My only complaint about the volume as a whole is that Price often interjects comments about Biblical higher criticism as he does his editor's notes.  Why?  The connection seems torturous at best.  I don't expect to hear an evaluation of the Cthulhu Mythos in a sermon and I really don't expect to read a discussion on higher criticism when reading about the Cthulhu Mythos.  Sometimes these collections are better if you don't read the editor's notes first.  Well, caveat emptor!	2005-03-13

The authors wanted to include \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\" as well as \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", but since it was too expensive to include with the campaign, a friend offered to underwrite the expense of publishing the material, plus other fiction, as a separate volume.  Voila!  The Antarktos Cycle.    Contents:  \\"Antarktos\\" - from the \\"Fungi of Yuggoth\\" poem by HPL  \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\"  \\"The Sphinx of the Ice Fields\\" - excerpts  \\"The Greatest Adventure\\"  \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\"  \\"The Tomb of the Old Ones\\"  \\"At the Mountains of Murkiness\\"  \\"The Thing From Another World\\"  \\"The Brooding City\\"  \\"The Dreaming City\\"    Traditionally, these cycles are used to illustrate how HPL developed the concepts used in his stories.  \\"Arthur Gordon Pym\\" might be included solely for the purpose of the aformentioned campaign, but it is excellent Antarctic fiction by a rather important author in the development of horror.  Also, have you ever wondered where \\"tekel-li-li\\" comes from?  \\"Sphinx of the Ice Fields\\" has excerpts related to Pym's narrative.      \\"The Greatest Adventure\\" might also be useful for keepers planning to run the camapign for which Antarktos was designed - it describes the preparations for an Antarctic expedition as well as the actual undertaking itself.  The incredibly potent seeds of life that they find undoubtedly inspired the movie \\"Evolution\\" as well as other fiction    \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" is one of HPL's finest stories.  I would love to see a cinematic version of this.  Perhaps with global warming, Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness will someday be seen rising over the Antarctic plain!    I don't have much to say about the other titles.  The last two developthe \\"Old Ones\\" that lived in Irem.  Lovecraft sometimes used the same name for different concepts  - he claimed that contradictory facts were more appropriate to an ancient myth cycle than having everythinng fit together neatly.  They could have been left out and finished the book with ...    \\"The Thing From Another World\\" - I expected this to be pulpy, but it was surprisingly serious.  Antarctic researchers discover an alien craft embedded in the ice.  Unwittingly releasing an alien with control over its morphology at the sub-cellular level, it replicates itself by consuming and imitating life around itself.  Who is human, and who is the monster?  Do the infected humans even know that they are no longer human?  Can they take the chance on anyone leaving the base alive?  An incredible psychodrama as well as science fiction and horror.  Great stuff - made me want to watch Carpenter's version again.    So yes, there are some very annoying typos, but the quality of the fiction is mostly top-notch, with some very unusual themes being explored.  Don't let this collection pass you by.	2005-01-29

Lovecraft Volume 4 2002 (Graphic Classics)	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Necessary for the Lovecraft Collector	I think the previous reviewer has covered the material fairly well.  So I will mention mostly points of divergence. <br /> <br />\\"Herbert West: Reanimator\\" - I thought having each section illustrated by a different artist captured the essence of the serialization of the novel.  To my mind, it was always rather jarring to have each section of the story reintroduce the previous events; having a different artistic style with each installment acknowledge this.   <br /> <br />\\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\\" - it should be pointed out that these are only excerpts.  It would otherwise be a much longer novel, but still it should be said. <br /> <br />\\"The Outsider\\" - I happened to enjoy this. It is Gothic horror without the Cthulhu-squishiness. I always enjoy a little something different. <br /> <br />\\"The Cats of Ulthar\\" - Here I agree with the reviewer; set in HPL's Dreamlands, the illustrations are very dreamlike - somewhat caricatured and abstract, with flowing outlines carrying a hint of menace. <br /> <br />\\"Fungi from Yuggoth\\" - I don't have \\"fungi\\" in any of my collections, so i was just glad to have it here.	2005-01-29
US	52254254	R1YSB5PR7T7JP0	0345444078	129913782	Shadows over Innsmouth	Books	4	7	9	N	Y	British "fish and chips"	I'd like to point out that all of these authors (excepting only HPL himself) are British.  Others have pointed this out, but it bears repeating.  Most of these stories are set in England, which produces a different interpretation on Innsmouth than American writers.  I suspect that the British simply have a different way of viewing things. <br /> <br />Most of the writing was excellent, and the rest was at least innovative.  \\"Deepnet\\" suggests that as far as Deep Ones taking over humanity, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  \\"Dagon's Bell\\" by Lumley is one of the most Lovecraftian stories in this collection and \\"Beyond the Reef\\", while a little hard to follow, drew in many elements from Lovecraft's Massachusetts.   <br /> <br />Some of the writing I found very difficult to appreciate; \\"Down to the Boots\\" and \\"Only the End of the World Again\\".  Maybe the British write in a less concrete way than American authors, but I really had no idea what these stories were about - they seemed more like fragments.  Maybe I'm too uncultured to appreciate writing like this, but I felt it brought down the quality of the collection. <br /> <br />There were also a number of stories that I wondered why they used the Innsmouth device.  As far as I could tell, they would have been good stories on their own and then had the Innsmouth/Deep Ones jammed in.  It makes a poor ad hoc plot device - why not just develop your own ideas?  \\"Homecoming\\" was the absolute worst offender - it's about going home to Romania after the end of communism only to find nothing has changed.  The only connection to Innsmouth was calling the secret police \\"Deep Ones\\".  I suppose metaphorically it is how the non-collaborators of Innsmouth might feel about their icthyic oppressors, but it's a real stretch to say it belongs. <br /> <br />Well, the stories themselves have been well reviewed below, so I'll leave them alone.  It's a decent collection of interesting writing, sometimes loosely connected to the Lovecraftian canon.  My only concern is that many stories seem to have had the plot device forcibly inserted.	2004-12-13

Drawing on the same body of UFO lore and paranormal activity as the X-Files, DELTA GREEN has tapped into something very deep.  And of course, once you have a successful RPG, you might as well start the fiction flowing, right? <br /> <br />Dark Theaters has some fairly lenghty short stories, designed to flesh out the world of DELTA GREEN.  Some clues and hints are elaborated on; what exactly happened during the fabled raid on Innsmouth in 1928?  What was the final mission of Gen. Fairfield?  We find out more about the summoning by the Karotechia that was a dress rehearsal for the end of the world, but the entirety of the episode remains tantalizingly removed. <br /> <br />Dark Theaters, like the rest of DELTA GREEN fiction, is about what it means to be human. Or not human.  The monstrosities which are called up and cannot easily be put away serve to highlight our humanity.  But in the end, humanity is just short-hand for a fundamental incomprehension of the universe.  We are carrying on a rear-guard action against reality, buying our fellow-man time for ... what?  To say that humanity loses in the end is to pretend that there are other players, rules agreed upon, some validity to having tried and lost.  Life is a game of solitaire, and we're not playing with a full deck.  All is meaninglessness, a blowing of the wind. <br /> <br />And yet humanity means staying in the game.  Like Lucifer, the real patron saint of lost causes, we know that we will lose and darnit, we are going to keep playing the hand we were dealt.  It gives meaning to life, death, and the passing of the seasons, the sacrifices we have made and those we have sacrificed, to play by the rules, even if there aren't any.  So let us cheer for the hero and jeer for the villain, and not go gently into that dark night. <br />	2004-11-15

No offense to the author, but most people don't regularly use the term \\"social inversion\\", let alone bring it up constantly in conversation.  If you are a cultural transgressor looking to be affirmed in your okayness, this is perhaps a good book for you.  I was looking to be affirmed in my nostalgia, so I am out of luck.<br /><br />(Normally I don't review books down because I disagree with the author; however, I feel that this is marketed deceptively.  Normal people don't talk like this guy writes, so I can only imagine that he is one of those people that must rework every concept to fit his sociological theories.

Would THEY withhold information from the citizenry, information on a plot to colonize humanity, in order to keep society functioning as THEY wish?  Is it better to die not knowing what waits in the darkness?  DELTA GREEN knows that since 1928 the FBI has had knowledge of an undersea race, implanting their genes into coastal communities, establishing a population of collaborators for the coming invasion.  And things only got weirder from there... <br /> <br />\\"Denied to the Enemy\\" is a story about Nazis during WW II, and their attempts to use occult powers to further their eugenic agenda.  However, a secret cabal has found ancient knowledge, knowledge their Nazi masters cannot be trusted with.  Knowledge that falls into the hands of the Allies during a raid to stop the cabal from tapping into the power of the undersea race.   <br /> <br />But that's just the beginning.  \\"Denied to the Enemy\\" is also a story of WWII espionage.  Yanks and Brits have to decide how much they can trust each other, and how much of their secrets they can reveal. Each partner has had a glimpse of The Truth, the reality that lies outside the comfortable, sane picture of the universe that humanity collectively constructs.  Each side hungers for the knowledge of the other, but worries about the sanity of the other should they, too, know all.  An interesting dilemma, no? <br /> <br />But now we get to the meat of the story.  \\"Denied to the Enemy\\" is a story about a time-traveling race, establishing their own future.  However, time is not static; our future turns on a knife's edge, and this time-traveling race must ensure its own survival in the future bycarefully orchestrating our own demise in the present.  However, one member develops a sense of morals, and decides that it would be more fair if EVERYONE dies (has a certain charm, huh?).  The agents are pawns of both sides, but who to trust, if anyone?  Changing the future is a dicey business, considering that every moment, the future becomes the past. <br /> <br />But, of course, \\"Denied to the Enemy\\" is a story about one man.  If all the world's a stage, then there's an audience of one.  All of those around us are mere scenery as we wend our way through Time in infinite isolation.  The real story, the drama, is the monologue we carry on as we parcel out our measure of time.  One man knows his script ahead of time, and that makes all the difference.  Does he have the courage to ad-lib his lines?  Do any of us, really? <br />	2004-10-27

It gives more substance to the conspiracy of silence by our goverment on the supernatural, extraterrestrial, and subterrestrial.      Some situations explored by the authors are a resurgence in the colonization of humanity by aquatic beings who seem almost human, a review board examining a failed mission to stop a dimensional disturbance in South America, a sojourn into a spirit-realm by two ghouls, alternately trying to save or damn the soul of an unwitting agent, the last testament of a man who has spent his life trying to decode a message in alien technology and intends to use that message to escape from his captors, among other stories that will give you an idea of the psychological torment that must wrack these defenders of humanity.      Because the monsters, magic, and aliens are just a backdrop; the story is about men and women who become something they don't want to in order to protect those that they love.   Who lose thir humanity to protect it in others.  Who were just following orders until they realized it was what they wanted all along.  Because when you take away the monsters, all that remains is a mirror, and you see yourself.	2004-10-27

So it's a niche market, but you didn't find this page just by chance, did you?  If you're going to read \\"Rules of Engagement\\", you might as well start with the other two.  Sure, they're becoming hard to get, but no sense doing something halfway, eh?     \\"Rules of Engagement\\" is a story about a kidnapping, and also a murder mystery, and a detective story, which is also a love story; it could also be one of those Tom Clancy CIA stories, but with less-expensive toys.  It definitely involves at least one conspiracy, and a little breaking-and-entering.  There are two or three mysteries that never get resolved, and one major character bites the dust (or does he?).  Some people would say that it is a stylistically-poor novel, but I say it's a snapshot of life.  The weird doesn't become normal, loose ends don't get tied up, and stories don't end where you want them to.      Because \\"Rules of Engagement\\" is a human psychodrama.  The characters have their motivations; love, fear, loyalty, resentment, desire ... shake them like dice and roll them on the stage of life.  They play their parts, whether good or bad, but at least with authenticity.  And then the curtain comes down, and you have to put in another quarter to watch any more.

It's not a horror anthology; I can't say that a lot of it is even scary.  More than half of the stories are essays of the author's memories of Halloween.  I feel that this is as it should be.  Halloween is a look backwards, before the disenchantment of the world.  When there were still dark corners of the earth, where the unexplained still covered a wide variety of phenomena, before positivist materialism drew the colors out of life, leaving only gray.  Halloween has both a dark and an exciting side, where the dead may rise to life and spirits of the dead may revel, but also where people can see and experience that something more than this world exists, that we are more than just ashes and dust and that life is has a purpose more than the 70-odd years we have.  We love to be comfortably scared, and so we have one night a year where we allow ourselves to believe in phantoms and faeries, that we can feel \\"something that's just not right.\\"<br /><br />That's why I like the memories better than the stories.  Most people who write about Halloween write about things that scare themselves, things that they allow themselves to be afraid of once a year.  For many people that's losing a child, or or a spouse, being confronted with an unbearable secret, or whatever lives underneath the bed at night.  If you don't share the author's fears, or if frankly the fear is too personal for you, it is difficult to lose yourself in the story.  Suprisingly, the memories were better.  They were sort of a safe nostalgia, most of which involved some weird or supernatural occurrence.  And we, the readers, can comfortably enjoy imagining being in the same circumstances.  The memory essays were also better at evoking the mood of Halloween - the dry, crumbly leaves, the cool wind and crisp nights, the dark sky above and bonfires below, the good food at home as the harvest time begins.<br /><br />One of the agonies of modern man is that he has lost his sense of time.In the soulless cubicle, spring is summer is autumn is winter.  The world turns, but he lacks any markers to delineate the passage of time.  Without any means to measure his progress through time, he loses any sense of meaning for the here and now.  We appreciate the present more when we build snowmen in winter, fly kites in the spring, eat ice-cream and catch fire-flies in the summer, and rake leaves in the fall.  We need Halloween to keep faith with the past, to share feelings we normally repress with those who have gone before us.  So happy Halloween, even if all you get is a bag of rocks!	2004-10-27

However, references to \\"K'n-yan\\", \\"red-litten Yoth\\", and \\"Yig, Father of Snakes\\" would crop up and I didn't know to what it referred.  By using my handy-dandy Encyclopedia Cthulhiana (whose primary function is to look in what story a particular nameless entity crops up) I discovered that I should be reading \\"The Horror in the Museum\\" and \\"The Mound.\\"  Wonderful, but where should I look for these tales?  Enter THE HORROR IN THE MUSEUM AND OTHER REVISIONS.<br /><br />This book contains 10 stories to which Lovecraft added his stamp (some of which he practically ghost-wrote).  As in \\"The Challenge From Beyond\\", it is often not difficult to see the transition to Lovecraft's ... particular ... style of narration.<br /><br />For the purposes of completeness of Lovecraft's corpus, I would recommend reading \\"The Horror in the Museum\\" and \\"The Mound\\".  As far as I know, these stories are unavailable elsewhere.  \\"Winged Death\\" and \\"The Curse of Yig\\" are in addition effective at evincing chills.  The rest are so-so, and may strike your fancy, and for others will fall quite flat.	2004-10-11
US	52254254	R2IQVK3TT8TPGP	0812516605	714481423	Cold Print	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	The essential collection of Campbell's Mythos contributions	Ramsey Campbell's stories are an important contribution to the development of the mythology begun by Lovecraft and continued by Derleth and others.  Rather than pastiche well-developed Lovecraftian entities and places, Campbell takes the core ideas (ancient survivals, subterranean catacombs, monstrous gods of old, etc.) and builds a parallel, contemporary mythology of his own.  This one is set in the forests, lakes, and beaches of Britain, different books of horror such as \\"The Revelations of Glaaki\\", and different beings of power, such as Eihort and Y'Golonac. <br /> <br />Campbell's tales are inherently Lovecraftian, but the different context creates a new flow to the stories.  Lovecraft's back-atmosphere is Puritan New England; Campbell's back-atmosphere is Celts and Druids - the same, but different.  Lovecraft looked at the pre-modern with both deisre and horror; Campbell makes you look at the modern in the same way.  I think that he particularly inspires a certain revulsion to the body (think \\"Before the Storm\\" and \\"The Faces at Pine Dunes\\"). <br /> <br />The works included here are some of Campbell's best, and have certainly been drawn on most heavily by others writing in the Cthulhu mythos.  The list includes \\"The Insects from Shaggai\\", \\"The Inhabitant of the Lake\\", \\"Before the Storm\\", \\"Cold Print\\", \\"The Tugging\\", and \\"The Faces at Pine Dune.\\"  I was disappointed to see that \\"The Franklyn Paragraphs\\" was not included.  Much of Ramsey Campbell's Lovecraftian fiction is being reprinted by Chaosium, but it is done, unfortunately, in a piecemeal fashion.  This is probably the best collection that you can still find.	2004-10-09

Lovecraft had a very modernistic outlook - a rationalistic materialist with the premise that man could indefinitely improve himself through the proper application of his intellect.  Naturally, the thing that would disturb him the most is the idea that there ARE gods and other beings, and that they don't CARE about us, because our vaunted intellect is actually quite feeble and entirely unable to grasp the truth of the universe.  Derleth is a quintessentially 1950's post-modern man, who sees that the universe is indeed quite a bit more strange than we can imagine, but that through the proper application of scientific inquiry we can make quite a bit of headway in understanding, describing, cataloging, and controlling that strangeness. <br /> <br />Yes, you can imagine that fans of the one might find the other infuriating. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Derleth is rarely considered as an author in his own right rather than an addendum to HPL.  Yes, there is a fannish-quality to Derleth's name-dropping and \\"Ia!Ia!\\" proclamations, but he does write a good tale.  You may decide that it is really more science-fiction than cosmic horror, but taking each story on its own merits will allow you to appreciate what Derleth has in store for you. <br /> <br />The first half is \\"The Mask of Cthulhu\\", which is composed of unrelated short stories dealing with \\"you-know-who\\".  These are mostly rewrites of Lovecraftian stories - \\"The Whipporwills in the Hills\\" is the Dunwich Horror + The Rats in the Walls, \\"The Seal of R'yleh\\" is The Shadow Over Innsmounth, etc.  These are fairly good stories and would be better than some that make it into Chaosium's Cycle series. <br /> <br />The second half is \\"The Trail of Cthulhu\\", which unlike the first half is composed of interlocking short stories.  Each one is the testimony of one person who became involved with the mysterious Dr. Shrewsbury and his quest against Cthulhu.  Each person's narrative is a glimpse into the war waged by Shrewsbury against Cthulhu and his minions.  Unlike the Lovecraftian formula,  the protagonists have a way out; Laban has made a contract with Hastur whereby he has gained the secret of space mead (which allows the user to survive in space, among other strange powers), the ability to call for help from Hastur's minions, and a refuge on another world.  The servants of Cthulhu are always a step behind Shrewsbury and his assistants, who are doing their best to protect humanity without losing their lives in the process. <br /> <br />The narratives are well written and the interlocking stories are a great device, but \\"Trail of Cthulhu\\" seems more clinical to me than it should.  No one ever really gets their hands dirty.  Dr. Shrewsbury is helping Hastur fight Cthulhu - shouldn't there be a price paid for this assistance?  Is Hastur so beneficent, or does Laban have his own secret agenda?  Is Laban really who he says he is?  Pawns are occasionally sacrificed in this game to save humanity, but no mention is ever made of the degradation of the players' humanity as they sacrifice some to make their moves.   <br /> <br />In summary, these are stories I will read more than once, and the collection as a whole is pretty good.  It does, however, gloss over the darkness in mankind to tell a cosmic story, and I think that removes the horror from where it should be, which is in the soul.	2004-10-09

Lewis is known for being one of the best apologists (and amateur theologians) of our day.  Primarily, Lewis is a writer; he knows how to use words to draw the reader in, and then humbly offers his insights on whatever topic is at hand.  It is this humility that I think makes him so accessible - he talks about what he knows and doesn't presume to be an authority over anyone.<br /><br />About GOD IN THE DOCK specifically, this is a collection of his letters, columns, and speeches.  Most are short (4-10 pages) reflections on something he has encountered recently, from animal-rights protestations to dogma within the church to attempts to debunk myth to Christmas.  Really, though, each one of these essays is about modernism.  Modernism is the arch-enemy to Lewis - in its materialism, rationalism, statism and \\"groupism\\", it denies the validity of opposing systems of thought.  Miracles are definitively ruled because they can't be reproduced in a lab (which Lewis argues is precisely why they are \\"miraculous\\" in the first place.\\"  Christian beliefs are discarded because they are similar to other \\"primitve\\" myths; Lewis argues that if God is real and we are made in His image, it makes sense that we would have common motifs in how we think about Him.<br /><br />The essays in GOD IN THE DOCK are mostly designed to show the fallacies in people's thinking.  They start with an observation, continue to describe the orthodox Christian point of view, point out something which the reader already knows to be true, and then shows that it makes more sense in the context of orthodox thought rather than modernist thought.  What I found most interesting was that the same problems that Lewis wrestled with in his day are the same ones that Americans face today!  I'm not sure if this proves that history repeats itself or if America is just 50 years behind England.  Either way, Lewis' predictions for the future if his society continued to follow the modernist path were vindicated (if anything, he underestimated the degree to which society would degenerate).<br /><br />In summary, C.S. Lewis was a humble and insightful man whose essays cover a wide gamut of topics.  Each essay is short, about a 15 minute read, which is a comfortable way to wind down the day.  I think that he very correctly evaluated the danger that modernism poses to humanity.  Finally, his essay topics are very relevant to Americans whose country is now hashing outt he same issues that Lewis' nation did fifty years ago.	2004-09-06

It was previously noted that some of these stories are more fantasy than horror, but I think that the variety makes THE BOOK OF IOD more readable. <br /> <br />\\"The Secret of Kralitz\\" - A family has an evil generational secret.  The induction into the secret is horrible, but so is the grounds for induction. <br /> <br />\\"The Eater of Souls\\" - Dunsanian fantasy, I believe. <br /> <br />\\"The Black Kiss\\" - I felt that this was a new interpretation on the Deep Ones and their transformation.  <br /> <br />\\"The Jest of Droom-Avista\\" - Another Dunsanian fantasy, dealing with the peril of scientific progress at any cost <br /> <br />\\"The Spawn of Dagon\\" - A story of Deep Ones in Atlantis; it seems to be a pastiche combining Robert Howard and  Howard Lovecraft. <br /> <br />\\"Hydra\\" - A great story about two men who use a drug to see past our dimension into another.  Unfortunately, it springs a trap that allows a horror to steal the head and soul of a famous writer and scholar of the occult.  Then, the scholar wants amends to be made... <br /> <br />\\"Bells of Horror\\" - set in California, \\"Bells\\" is about a cursed set of bells discovered in an archaeological dig.  They have an effect of madness on living things around them, but the madness really begins when they ring. <br /> <br />	2004-09-06

Some of it is about goats, other parts are about fertility gods, and some just have an invocation of \\"Ia! Shub blah-blah-blah\\".  Surprisingly, I saw no \\"dark-young\\" themed stories.  Anyway, what I found to be good was surprising: <br /> <br />\\"The Horn of Vapula\\", \\"The Demoniac Goat\\", \\"The Ghostly Goat of Glaramara\\": these were pleasantly \\"MR James\\"ish ghost stories; tales from the English countryside about some or other ghostly phenomenon related by someone supposedly too educated/cultured/mature to believe in such rot.  I find this sort of thing a pleasant evening read, even if it is not lovecraftian at all. <br /> <br />\\"A Thousand Young\\": this story by Robert Price was designed to puch the envelope on sexual contentin describing the blasphemous orgies and festivals that HPL alludes to.  It does have an appropriate HPL ending.  In my case, I felt that the envelope had been pushed too far and wasn't comfortable reading it. <br /> <br />\\"Grossie\\": As far as I can tell, this has no Mythos connection at all; it's just a darn good story.  After a strange phenomenon, one member of a group talks to something no one else can see.  Than she walks away and is never seen again.  It's been a long while since a story made me sit up at night thinking.  It's hard to say why this should be so disturbing.  Here are my thoughts: you get used to the way the Mythos operates.  You read the scary book, fraternize with the weird cutlists, go alone into the dark basement, you have an unhappy ending.  Avoid the typical horror-scenario, and you're fine.  How much scarier is it when you don't know if you're in the scenario or not?  What happened to my friend, and where did she go?  Why was her body never found?  Could the same thing happen to me?  And most of all, TO WHOM WAS SHE SPEAKING BEFORE HER DISAPPEARANCE?  To those for whom less is more, this will give you chills. <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad anthology.  Some stories are very fanzine-ish, but non are really terrible and there is a varietyu of styles and themes.	2004-08-13

THE CTHULHU CYCLE is marked by strong writing and and classic tales pertaining to Cthulhu.  Something included that I have missed from some of the other anthologies is the editor's notes that discuss academically the stories and their part in the development of the Mythos.  Having certain influences pointed out is helpful to those who are familiar enough with Lovecraft's work to want more depth. <br /> <br />\\"A Shop in Go-By Street\\" by lord Dunsany: A few phrases on an idol in a reliquary seem to have sparked the first half of Lovecraft's famous story.  Knowing that Dunsany strongly influenced HPL, I appreciated seeing one of his stories included. <br /> <br />\\"Count Magnus\\" by MR James: I'm not sure that this strongly ties in with the theme, but James is an excellent writer of terror and horror, and this is one of his better stories. <br /> <br />\\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" by that guy.  You don't expect it to be missing, do you? <br /> <br />\\"The Black Islnad\\" by August Derleth: I have a beef about Derleth's \\"Shrewbury cycle.\\"  The guy is like some Scooby-Doo mystery gang, globe-trotting and solving mysteries.  It has the feel of organized resistance to the Old Ones, and winning to boot.  But, being the influence that he has been, Derleth's work deserves to be there. <br /> <br />\\"Patiently Waiting\\" is a story from Inspector Lagrasse's point of view, as he deals with cults and Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (tm).  As with other stories in this collection, the characters are fleshed out along with their emotions and motivations.   <br /> <br />\\"Recrudescence\\": this is an interesting story about a different cult, a different god, and a different mechanism for release.  I've seen something similar in \\"The Greatest Adventure\\" by Eric Temple Bell, but otherwise it is an original plot device involving the stored bio-energy of dead species. <br /> <br />\\"Black Fire\\": Usually I don't care for lovecraftian stories where the good-guys triumph - it seems like a contradiction in terms.  HPL's vision is that the universe doesn't care if there is a happy ending.  In \\"Black Fire\\", a carefully-laid plan for the return of the Old Ones is thwarted by a simple man doing the only thing he can think of to stop the destruction.  His great sacrifice saves the day, even as the next trap leading to man's destruction begins to unfold elsewhere.  It has the feel of inevitable doom that we all know and love, but our capacity to sacrifice for the good of others makes the horror more poignant (if we are mere brutes with no redeeming and enduring qualities, it is hard to feel regret for our passing). <br /> <br />\\"Zombies from R'Lyeh\\": The main strength of this piece for me was the author's development of the setting.  His description and invocation of tropical seas and islands is a siren song, and the horror is more personal when I feel the longing to be in the same place.  I am now seriously considering dropping my thesis work and becoming a pirate to sail the tropical seas.  Yar, be forewarned!	2004-08-09

For DISCIPLES OF CTHULHU, I was pleasantly surprised to be able to say that all these stories are excellent due to the quality of writing.  These are some of the best Mythos stories that I have read to date, and I appreciate that they have been compiled together.  It would be more appropriate to title this collection THE DISCIPLES OF LOVECRAFT, since few have to do with Cthulhu himself. <br /> <br />\\"The Fairground Horror\\": An unscrupulous carny worker wishes to learn the full power of his ancient artifacts so that he can use them for financial gain.  Dreams come to him from an underground island of basaltic rock to warn him to take proper respect.  Knowledge has its price... <br /> <br />\\"The silence of Erika Zann\\": A modern retelling of \\"The music of Erich Zann\\". <br /> <br />\\"All-eye\\": a story from the Great White North.  A student tries to escape the clutches of a wendigo-spirit.  What he finds is even worse. <br /> <br />\\"The Tugging\\": A story about a man's investigation of his past.  As he learns more of his family's part in an unfolding story that he is reporting on, his investigation becomes an obsession.  He learns the truth, but like Cassandra, his knowledge does not save him. <br /> <br />\\"Where Yidhra Walks\\": Set in the American West, describes an encounter with a different kind of Mythos being. <br /> <br />\\"Glimpses\\": An intriguing story about the investigation of time and space.  The first part takes place in the past, as an initiate and his master investigate the mysteries of Yog-Sothoth.  The second half deals with a future military research lab that attempts to use that knowledge to build a weapon.  Of course, tampering with Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (tm) brings terrible results. <br /> <br />\\"Dope War of the Black Tong\\": A yellow peril story, in the same vein as some of Robert E. Howard's work.  An enjoyable change of pace. <br /> <br />\\"Darkness, My Name is\\": It begins as a typical story about a skeptical mystical researcher dropped into a cult town and interfering with the ritual activities.  Then we learn that the skeptical resrearcher has a much deeper past and is more intimately tied to the events than we thought. <br /> <br />\\"The Terror From The Depths\\": This story deals with one man's struggle with his true nature.  It's actually a little difficult to follow, and more is hinted at than is spelled out clearly.  The setting is California, which is a change of scenery for most. <br /> <br />This was a very enjoyable collection for me.  Well-written stories are usually worth reading, and the pleasure is doubled when the subject is one that you follow.	2004-08-07

That's not really a great way to start a review, but hey, I didn't write this book either.  Many of these are fanzine-pastiches, others are poorly written; by this, I mean that the ideas are not developed enough that the reader feels immersed in the story, or else the author tried to convey madness or temporal-spatial dislocation by writing in a confusing and disjointed manner.  It takes skill to accomplish this successfully, or the device falls flat.  I'll list some of my preferred stories below: <br /> <br />\\"KADATH/ The Vision and The Journey\\": a poem about a dreamquest like Randolph Carter's.  Just seeing the prose narrative transformed to poetry is interesting.  I give it some points for novelty. <br /> <br />\\"The Franklyn Paragraphs\\": This is one of Ramsey Campbell's more famous Lovecraftian works.  If you follow his branch of the Mythos, this is an important story, although you can also get it in COLD PRINT. <br /> <br />\\"Behold, I Stand at the Door and Knock\\": I think this is a second-rate tale of sexual perversion, but the trap at the end gave it a twist.  Hey, if it's your thing... <br /> <br />\\"Those of the Air\\": A more personal retelling of \\"The Dunwich Horror.\\"  Why does no one ever feel sympathy for the Son of Yog-Sothoth? <br /> <br />\\"The Scourge\\": At first I thought it was a story about another unspeakable tome, but it is really about one man's expiation of his failures to the Old Ones. <br /> <br />\\"Star Bright, Star Byte\\": What possibilities does virtual reality offer cultists for the summoning of their gods?  An interesting story hook that hasn't been developed before. <br /> <br />The rest are uninspiring; not necessarily bad, but they don't stand out.  I'd rate it as a maybe-read rather than a must-read.	2004-08-07

The author does not get his point across, or the characters are formulaic or the stories have no internal consistency, etc. I can forgive a lot in writing; I just want an interesting twist on a borrowed idea or a common story with a different perspective. Throughout most of this collection, I felt as if I were reading rough drafts of stories. <br />  <br /> The highlights: <br />  <br /> &quot;Cross my heart, hope to die&quot;: The story of a young boy's attempt to escape from a cult. This was well written and motivated empathy with the characters. The real horror in this story is what people do to their own. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Queen&quot;: The narrative device and perspective alone make this story interesting.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Free the Old Ones&quot;: a fascinating protrayal of the descent into madness. This was well fleshed out and believable; usually, the insanity part of a story is where I have to suspend disbelief, but in &quot;Free the Old Ones&quot; it is the story itself. Also, the cult collaborators are hilarious as parodies of student activists (even if you are a student activist, surely you know some people who actually would demonstrate for Cthulhu rights?). <br />  <br /> Many of the other stories fell flat and seemed incomplete or amateurish. If you really want stories on Goatswood or the Severn Valley, try COLD PRINT by Ramsey Campbell.	2004-08-01

Apparently they are waiting for their turn in line at the brothel called &quot;Earth&quot;.<br /><br /> The good:<br /><br /> &quot;The Great god Pan&quot;, &quot;The White People&quot;, and &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;: Great classics. The first two are by Arthur Machen and appear in other collections by Chaosium. &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; is one of Lovecraft's finest, in my opinion.<br /><br /> The rest:<br /><br /> Some hideous monster has relations with a human woman and progeny anf horror result all around. It seemed mostly uninspired to me, although the monster at least varied sometimes.<br /><br /> Finally, I found &quot;Wilbur Whately Waiting&quot; to capture the spirit of HPL in a way I didn't imagine. Wilbur is brought back to this world in the modern day to finish what he started. However, the world has passed him by. Every &quot;magick&quot; store sells copies of the Necronomicon and humans more disturbing than Wilbur roam the street. To borrow from Lovecraft, we have become so jaded that Arthur Machen's &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; wouldn't even CAUSE a scandal. The soul of the modern world is too dead to even react to one such as Wilbur. But he does find purpose in a key . . .<br /><br /> You might purchase WHERE THE OLD GODS WAIT just to have two excellent stories by Arthur Machen, &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, and &quot;Wilbur Whately Waiting&quot; will give you something to consider. As a collection, I thought the filler fell flat and brought down the rest of the book.	2004-07-31

The most useful aspects of the Hastur Cycle are the exploration of the evolution of the concept of Hastur and the major stories about the Mi-go.  Of course, I agree with everyone here that the two concepts should not have been joined.  <br />The two Chambers tales, &quot;The yellow Sign&quot; and &quot;the Repairer of Reputations&quot; are both excellent, as well as &quot;the Return of Hastur&quot;.  Some of the Mi-go tales are pretty good, but clearly the best is &quot;The Whisperer in the Darkness&quot;, which can be found elsewhere.  Otherwise, it all seemed pretty derivative.  I would look for the stories separately.	2004-05-03

The only work that I had previously known by Arthur Machen was &quot;The Great God Pan&quot;, which has shown up in so many anthologies that I am thoroughly sick of it, although it is a good read the first few times through.  &quot;The Inmost Light&quot; was quite disturbing to me in terms of plumbing the depravity of the human soul. &quot;The Shining Pyramid&quot; was a good supernatural detective story, in my opinion, although the intuitive leaps made by the protagonist would have made Fox Mulder proud.  This clearly inspired quite a few of Robert Howard's stories.<br />Clearly, the crown jewel of this collection is &quot;The Three Imposters.&quot;  The deeper I got into this novel, the more engrossed I became.  It is made up of 14 short stories, each of which is part of an overarching storyline that involves the protagonist, a golden coin, a man with spectacles, and 3 people who are not who they say they are.

Howard (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)	Books	4	12	13	N	Y	IMHO, best Chaosium book yet	Robert Howard has a distinctly different worldview than Lovecraft, and his stories show it.  Courage, purity, and strength are sufficient to overcome evil in most of Howard's tales.  Very pulpy, but some stories I will read over again.<br />The best:<br />&quot;The Shadow Kingdom&quot;: this is one of the best fantasy tales ever written, in my opinion.  The mythic historicity, the barbarian strength and honor, the horror of the serpent people, the opposing magic, it all just came together and clicked for me.  You will probably find this in other Howard or Weird tales anthologies, but I cannot recommend this highly enough.<br />&quot;Worms of the Earth&quot;: opens with the leader of an oppressed people watching the torture and execution of one of his subjects.  He then goes on to seek his revenge through truly awful methods.  I found this story to be written in a very original style.<br />&quot;Dig Me No Grave&quot;: a genuinely Lovecraftian tale.  More Mythos!<br />Well written, very creepy.<br />&quot;The Fire of Ashurbanipal&quot; and &quot;Skull-face&quot; both deal with a typical Howardian protagonist confronting an evil from prehistoric times.  Both are well-written and differ from most of the stories that Chaosium issues (no moldy towns, 17th century houses, or bizarre tomes).<br />I didn't care for the finished fragments; the quality clearly dropped off where Howard ended and another author began (these were &quot;The Abbey&quot;, &quot;The Door to the World&quot;, &quot;The House in the Oaks&quot;, &quot;Black Eons&quot;, and &quot;The Challenge From Beyond&quot;.  To my amusement, by the time I had finished Nameless Cults, I knew EXACTLY where Howard did the writing in &quot;Challenge&quot;).<br />Overall, a good collection.  It is worth picking up for &quot;The Shadow Kingdom&quot; alone, or if you like the Howardian protagonist.	2004-05-02

I am rating this book so highly because of its exhaustive nature and usefulness as a resource.  There were many terms that I had been confused about and was glad to find a reference for.  The MOST useful aspect, though, was to discover which stories included settings or characters that I wanted to read more about (the Severn Valley comes to mind).  The Cthulhiana has been excellent in that respect, as I now know which authors and stories to pursue further.  My biggest problem with this book is the ridiculous mythologization of Lovecraft's deities (I think this is primarily due to Lin Carter).  There's a an awful lot of &quot;and so great Cthulhu mated with Asdfgh to produce the hideous offspring Qwer'ty-Zxc'vb, who did reside under Mt. Nyctalopolis until 1953...&quot;  The combination of endless run-on names (&quot;I'd like to buy a vowel&quot;...) and unnecessary family relations, like some sort of Jerry Springer show from the Xothian system, induces humor rather than horror in me.  Perhaps Chaosium would print an expurgated version, without Carter's mythology crap (it seems there's an expurgated version of every OTHER text floating around) ...	2004-05-02
US	52254254	RYLGFDESZNOTP	0801011213	734501324	Grace Unknown: The Heart of Reformed Theology	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Very systematic	R.C. Sproul has written an excellent book on what is Reformed theology.  I expected an exposition of &quot;TULIP&quot;, but a section on theology in general and a section on the foundations of Reformed theology were added for good measure.  <br />THEOLOGY - the study of God, not of religion.  Sproul outlines the differences between theology, whhich studies God, and anthropology, which studies what different groups think about God or their gods.  Scripture, history, and nature should inform our study of God (although certainly not with equal weight).<br />5 FOUNDATIONS - Sproul's 5 foundations are CENTERED ON GOD, BASED ON GOD'S WORD ALONE, COMMITTED TO FAITH ALONE, DEVOTED TO JESUS CHRIST, and STRUCTURED BY THREE COVENANTS.  These are not meant to be unique to the Reformed tradition but to explain the basis for Reformed beliefs.  Many groups of Christians share some of these foundations.  <br />5 BELIEFS - The 5 elements of the famous Reformed acrostic: TOTAL DEPAVITY, UNCONDITIONAL ELECTION, LIMITED ATONEMENT, IRRESISTIBLE GRACE, and PRESERVATION OF THE SAINTS.  Sproul investigates the meaning of each of these elements and the justification for them.  Some space is also devoted to refuting the antithesis of each element.  Frankly, I don't think anyone would come away converted on any point, but it does explain better what the Reformed believe on each point and some tangential issues.<br />THE GOOD: the book is put togther simply, the arguments are simple, and there are simple illustrations.  Conceivably, this is targeted towards people who know a little about the Reformed tradition but aren't opposed to it.  It would qualify as a good introduction.<br />THE BAD: Sproul's book has some shortcomings.  First, there is not much space devoted to the development of TULIP, so the reader is not as well educated on the topic.  The Armenian position is not taken seriously; I don't expect him to agree or to concede points, but I expected it to be addressed more.  Finally, there is no conclusion or summary; &quot;P&quot; gets wrapped up and that's it.  I felt as if I were left hanging.  Finally, I just finished John Macarthur's &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus,&quot; and I was spoiled by his extensive footnoting.  Sproul's complete lack of footnotes, such as when quoting Augustine, disappointed me.  I like knowing that I can look up a quote or reference if I wish to.<br />In summary, this is a good introduction, but read something meatier if you already know TULIP.	2004-03-20

THE SPACE OF MADNESS was intriguing from the standpoint of space exploration, and the plot device in THE PLAGUE JAR was interesting.  The poem AZATHOTH and THE INSECTS FROM SHAGGAI were good classics.  A few stories, such as THE PIT OF THE SHOGGOTHS and THE THRONE OF ACHAMOTH simply interested me.  And then there's the pulp filler that's thematic.  Very good overall.<br />My only problem was that the spine was not sturdy.  Some of the other books from the same series have held up better.  It's not important to everyone, but I like my purchased books to remain in good condition.	2004-03-20

I prefer Lovecraft's neo-gnosticism to Blackwood's pagan naturalism.  To each his own, I guess.  Clearly, I am biased in favor of the former type of story over the latter, although there were many good stories.  <BR>So, with the standard disclaimers out of the way:<br />&quot;An Episode in a Lodging House&quot; - very Lovecraftian feel, including mystic text for doing Terrible Things (publication date 1906 predates HPL)<br />&quot;The Willows&quot; - can't say that I got into the spirit of this one.  It reminded me of pleasant camping trips and hikes, not anything awe- or terror- inspiring.  Other people seem to like it though.<br />&quot;The Insanity of Jones&quot; - an interesting story about karma and supposed justice.  I was curious to see whether the central character would choose vengeance or mercy.<br />&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; - this lengthy story about witchcraft and a town's dark history was a good read.  I found the love interest to be creepy and added to the atmosphere.<br />&quot;The Wendigo&quot; - this was my favorite.  The Wendigo was what I thought The Willows should have been.  The isolation, the dark, unexplored corners of the North, the terrifying abduction, all came together to be really eerie.  <br />&quot;The Man whom the Trees Loved&quot; - if pagans wrote evangelistic tracts, they would be this.  I felt that the writer was trying to proselytize more than write a good story.  It took up a large portion of the book as well.  Caveat emptor...<br />&quot;Sand&quot; - good use of suspense, realms beyond knowing.  This story and the Lodging House really show the source of many of Lovecraft's ideas (who was the inspiration for many other writers such as Robert Bloch and Stephen King, who influence us today).	2004-03-13
US	52254254	RPIIUM6YG3ISZ	0310394910	20919602	The Gospel According to Jesus: What Does Jesus Mean When He Says Follow Me?	Books	4	22	26	N	Y	Good Exposition, Discernment	When I bought The Gospel According to Jesus, I was curious as to what John MacArthur's position would be.  The &quot;free grace&quot; side was saying that you can't earn your salvation and that it is totally free.  This I know to be true.  However, as I read MacArthur's book, I was astounded by the &quot;common-sense&quot;ness of it.  Are we to obey God or not?  Can we claim to be a Christian and not follow Christ? Is repentance part of the Gospel?  I would literally have not believed that anyone would need to be told this if it weren't for almost 200 footnoted quotations from prominent Christian leaders and scholars, many stating that it is not necessary to follow Jesus to be saved.  It's hard to argue with extended quotations with references; if you believe it's out of context, go look it up!  MacArthur is as charitable as someone can be who is saying another person is wrong about the Gospel.  It certainly is not a polemic.<br />Major points:<BR>1)The gospel preached by many today has no power to save because it involves no call for repentance and no power for transformation.  It seemed reasonable to me that a faith that produces no outward sign of change has likely produced no inner change.  This can be supported by any Barna poll, btw, all of which show that even born-again-Christians are barely different from the world.  If salt has lost its saltiness . . .<br />2)The gospel preached by Jesus involved accepting Him as Lord.  Jesus always asked for a lot, and this is easily verifiable from the New Testament.<br />3)The parables preached by Jesus support the idea of costly grace.  We can't buy, earn, or even make payments on it, but those who receive it are called to sacrifice.  Every one of the apostles suffered in this world for receiving grace and becoming a disciple.  Jesus Himself said that the disciple is not greater than the master, and that if He suffered persecution, we will too.  <br />All that John MacArthur puts forward in The Gospel According to Jesus resonates well with the letters of James, John, and some of Paul's letters (Corinthians comes to mind).  If it is Biblical, that is all that matters to me.  The only argument I have heard against it that carries water is that if you believe this, how do you know if you are sufficiently obedient and repentant for sins?  All I can say is 1 Corinthians 9: 26-27<BR>&quot;Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty.  Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air.  But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.&quot;	2004-03-13

But that's okay, because that's what the Mythos is about. It wasn't intended to be great literature but a literary game. Bloch's early work has the same clumsiness as HPL's early work, and very similar atmosphere and plot elements. His middle stories are well-developed myhtos stories and are just as fun to read as Lovecraft originals. The back-and-forth that Bloch had with Lovecraft involving killing each other via horrible monsters in their stories was amusing. Bloch's later work was very interesting and took the concepts of the mythos in interesting directions. &quot;Notebook Found in a Deserted House&quot; is an example, as is &quot;Terror in Cut-Throat Cove&quot;, which was certainly original even if the ending is terribly campy. <BR>In short, the stories are good and worth purchasing. Also, the binding has held up well with little spine damage (this was a concern when I first saw these trade paperbacks, that they might not survive much reading, but that seems unfounded, at least in the 2nd ed.)	2004-03-13

Each of the 50 chapters is a straightforward analysis of 2-4 Bible verse from the Old and New Testaments.  His points are clear, focused, and short (each is 2 pages).  He covers a range of topics from sin to atonement to justification to discipleship to salvation, each intimately tied to the cross.  I think a mature Christian will gain a lot from Piper's 50 points, and can effectively use them in evangelization.	2004-02-27

Classic teenage-angst, rebellion against authority, headstrong belligerence used to solve every problem, youth-as-hero with establishment-as-villain . . .  I could go on, but you know the plot.  It could hardly be more cliche or more orthodox to Joseph Campbell's formulation of mythology. It isn't that I dislike the story, it just seems tired.  &quot;Moons of Mirrodin&quot; could just as easily be &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot; or any other post-modern formulation of the classic myth.  Maybe you young turks will resonate with it.<br />On the plus side, McDermott seems to know how to draw out the suspense.  I'm genuinely curious to see what direction the story will move in next (although McDermott is not writing the next novel, Darksteel Eye).  <br />And some of us will read this novel and the next one for no other reason than WotC controls our minds and pocketbooks.

I am disappointed in the quality of this novel.  Much like the old joke about army chow, &quot;It was terrible and the portion was too small.&quot;<br />1. The novel was much thinner than I am used to.  If the prices are going to be raised, I would like to at least have as much reading material as before.<br />2. Considering the writing quality, maybe the author was pressed to even fill as much space as he did.  The characters are almost universally as two-dimensional as the &quot;unmen&quot; were in the story and their static personalities clashed with the dynamism of the setting; the plot was repetitive, and the comic relief relied on juvenile body humor.  Karona's personality was the only bright spot in the novel, displaying a dynamic character throughout the story.<br />3. This wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't that I know that WoTC can do better.  The Artifacts Cycle and the Ice Age Cycle were much better than this.  The Brothers' War novel, for instance, had compelling characters that developed through the story, with real psychological drama, etc.  I really felt something reading it, other than &quot;Gee, was that it?&quot;  Maybe the target market has shifted for the novels, but nobody told me.<br />Well, you've been warned.	2004-01-05

I just don't find the West ... scary.  In addition, Bierce's style is very no-nonsense, straight-forward, factual reporting (which he can hardly be faulted for, since that was his job).  Finally, the foreword was surprisingly negative, both about the author and his work.  It colored my reading of the rest of this book, and I am amazed that the editor chose to allow it.  My recommendation is to read the book, and then the foreword last, so that it doesn't color your impression of the rest of the stories.<br />&quot;An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; is the canard that almost everyone has read in school at some time or another.<BR>&quot;Beyond the Wall,&quot; about a man who breaks an unusual relationship for spite and is haunted by the outcome, is somewhat famous, as is &quot;The Damned Thing,&quot; possibly for its ironic chapter titles.<BR>&quot;The Man and the Snake&quot; also has appeared in anthologies before, being somewhat of a psychological study.<br />My favorites were<BR>&quot;The Ways of Ghosts,&quot; &quot;Mysterious Disappearances,&quot; and &quot;Some Haunted Houses&quot; are short, factual tellings of supernatural incidents, which showcase Bierce's writing style and produce an air of authenticity.<BR>&quot;The Suitable Surroundings&quot; was another interesting tale dealing with newspapers, another area where I expected Bierce to shine.<br />In short, Bierce has a particular style that seems to me to not carry over well to terror/horror writing.  Sometimes a particular story will resonate with his abilities, and then you are glad to be reading the book.	2004-01-02

The last are Jackson-esque tomes like Peskin and Schroeder that dummies like me in a QFT class will never be able to use (&quot;dummies in a QFT class&quot; may sound like an oxymoron, but we're not all geniuses...).  The kind of texts that works out examples, like the text by Lahiri and Pal, have been invaluable to me, but I still have not always been able to understand the IDEAS contained in the mathematics.  <br />&quot;QFT in a Nutshell&quot; heralds the introduction of a book on quantum field theory that you can sit down and read.  My professor's lectures made much more sense as I followed along in this book, because concepts were actually EXPLAINED, not just worked out.  I still recommend having all three types of texts, but I am glad that now I have three types and not just the last two.<br />However, it might make sense to incorporate some of the explicit problem solving in Lahiri and Pal into &quot;QFT in a Nutshell&quot;; while I could understand the English, the math solutions often were difficult to follow.

Benson	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Post-Victorian ghost stories	I personally find it difficult to reconcile the fear of ghosts with the technology of the twentieth century.  Perhaps technology makes us feel too secure, too powerful, too material to fear the supernatural.  The mechanical seems to have replaced the spiritual in our lives, and when I read the second story in this anthology, about a ghostly car, I was surprised that I went on to enjoy the anthology as much as I did.  <br />Benson has a way of bringing out the dramatic, as in &quot;The Room in the Tower,&quot; or unmentionable horror, as in &quot;How Fear Departed from the Long Gallery&quot; or &quot;Caterpillars,&quot; or fear of what powers the mind can unleash, as in &quot;The Man who Went Too Far,&quot; or just humor, as in &quot;Mr. Tilly's Seance.&quot;  That's quite a range of experiences to be evoked, and I was able to eke out a good half-year's enjoyment from this voluminous collection.  <br />I have only two complaints about these stories, and they are common to quite a bit of weird tales produced between the 1890's and the 1930's: a prediliction towards unnecessary explanation of the supernatural at the end, and an obsession with spiritualism (or mesmerism, or psychics, or ESP, etc.).  The rationalism of the day no doubt demanded the former, but the latter unbearably dates literature that fawns over spiritualism.  Very few writers can use it as a plot device without it appearing to be a very rotten crutch, and Benson is not one of those writers.  Much like radiation in the 50's and biotechnology in the 90's, it's the deus ex machina and all the worse when debunked.<br />In any case, I was happy to take the good with the bad and look forward to reading this anthology again.	2004-01-02

LeFanu	Books	4	18	20	N	Y	Not your standard ghostly fare	Probably the most distinguishing characteristic of LeFanu's writing to me is that he doesn't explain why something is happening in his stories.  Ghosts search through drawers, skeletons are dug up, heroes disappear, and barons die of unseen causes, and we are never told what happened.  LeFanu doesn't necessarily explain the motives and occurrences of his stories and loose ends are not all tied up.  At first, I was unsure about what to think; what kind of ghost story doesn't explain all the events at the end?  How am I supposed to be terrified if I don't know the ultimate cause of Baron X's demise?  The method of storytelling began to grow on me, though, and I now feel that a lack of resolution on every issue creates a better story.  Why should the supernatural be fully explained in 20 pages?  When the reader is demoted from an omniscient viewpoint to that of only an eyewitness, the tale is more compelling.<br />My favorite stories are probably &quot;Sir Dominick's Bargain&quot; and &quot;An Authentic Narrative of a Haunted House,&quot; the former for its mood and atmosphere, and the latter for its minimalist telling.  &quot;The Haunted Baronet&quot; is another excellent story, with strong attention to detail and background that help in the story-telling; it was a very satisfactory read.  &quot;The Fortunes of Sir Robert Ardagh&quot; is the same story told sans background and detail, and is clearly inferior.  The other stories I enjoyed based on the setting, which is 19th century Ireland, which evokes a mood much like James'.  Overall, it is the sort of book that makes you wish for a warm fireplace and a stormy night.<br />Enjoy!	2003-09-14

I used his &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; to fill in the gaps at the advanced graduate level, and his &quot;Electrodynamics&quot; was essential to understanding Jackson. I'm sorry that I waited so long to purchase his &quot;Elementary Particles&quot;.<br />This book contains all the background that professors expect you to have already been exposed to: particle classification schemes, the November Revolution, relativistic kinematics, and fundamental force overviews.  Griffiths then goes on to discuss Feynman rules, QED, QCD, electroweak and gauge theories.  Griffiths also works out some essential problems, like muon decay, that you will want to see done, but I think it is done better by Lahiri and Pal (that, however, is a field theory book, which might be more advanced than is necessary to some people in particle physics).<br />This is a great text for anyone starting out in particle physics and for anyone who needs to review the fundamentals.  My only bone with Griffiths is that sometimes more of the work is left to the reader than is appropriate (those problems worked out in gory detail are a godsend when you genuinely aren't getting the point).	2003-09-03

It's come to be a relief to read a book on popular physics without the obligatory chapter on Einstein.  The author, Gordon Kane, spends that freed up space discussing how effective theories change the scope of physics at different scales of various parameters (size and speed being the usual ones).  This is something that the general public would benefit from knowing, as a great many people think that each new scientific discovery invalidates previous knowledge instead of expanding on previous knowledge.  <br />While Kane necessarily avoids burdensome mathematics, he does offer some &quot;proofs&quot; and &quot;requirements&quot; of supersymmetry that can be explained qualitatively.  This plus the Feynman diagrams are about the best you can expect without grabbing an advanced graduate-level textbook.  <br />One caveat: the author seems almost religiously convinced that the evidence for supersysmmetry is &quot;just around the corner&quot; and always speaks as if the experimental proof is a fait accompli.  Based on limits to the theory, we really ought to be seeing the lightest superpartner already and the reader feels that the book takes on an unrealistically-optimistic tone.	2003-05-26
US	52254254	RE9VL95O71IMY	0802421873	901890582	Dispensationalism	Books	4	12	14	N	Y	Helpful, but needs more background	I decided that I needed a primer on dispensationalism after reading a commentary on Romans by William Newell.  His work was thorough and insightful, but it assumed some background in dispensational thought and history.  Having been raised in a covenant-theology church, dispensational thought came to me as a revelation on how to understand the Bible.  However, I wanted to understand what was the basis for dispensational beliefs and how it fit together.  Charles Ryrie's book seemed like an easy way to get some background.<br />Much about Ryrie's book was helpful.  It defines dispensations (a particular method and revelation by which God interacts with the world), lists the 7 commonly accepted dispensations (Innocence, Conscience, Civil Government, Patriarchy, Mosaic Law, Grace, and Millenium), the hermeneutics (grammatical-historical), the historical development of these beliefs and the justification for approaching Scripture this way.  He also discusses eschatology, salvation, and the nature of the Church from a dispensational perspective.  These chapters answered most of the questions that I originally had in mind and put into perspective other popular literature based on the same system.  If you weren't raised in a dispensational church, this book can help you understand the allusions in modern evangelical culture.  <br />On the other hand, if you weren't raised dispensational, you will still miss allusions in this book.  For instance, the author refers to the 144,000 of Revelations in discussing church doctrinal statements.  Why?  I feel as if the author assumes a minimum level of exposure to dispensationalism which many folks just don't have.  Some other downsides: the author sprinkles objections from covenant and amillenialist positions throughout the book.  Ryrie tends to take exteme objections and either show that they are based on faulty logic or that the same objections can be made to the objector's own system.  Perhaps these are comments that dispensationalists can expect to hear, but I was left wondering if all theologians of other systems sound so shrill.  However, while Ryrie can be critical of other belief systems, he seems respectful and not emotional, keeping the tone of the book civil.  Also there are chapters on Progressive dispensationalism, Covenant theology, and Ultra-dispensationalism, which provide a background for other beliefs but are presented more as straw men.  Again, I imagine that the author meant to be helpful but should have stuck to his strengths.<br />In short, I'd say this is a good introduction to dispensationalism for someone who knows a little about it already.  If you are completely new to the topic, this book is at least short and succint.  I'd recommend getting something more in depth as a second source.	2003-05-26

That is because I did not understand what it meant to &quot;live by grace.&quot;  It took almost a year to finish the commentary (read in parallel with a Bible study group), but I now have a profoundly different concept of God's grace and how we as Christians experience it.  I would urge every Christian to study Romans intensely, and I would suggest this commentary to help you.  The commentary itself is exhaustive, making reference to the Greek for fine or disputative points.  <br />Two important points: <BR>   Newell uses his own translation, using King James English.  You might want to have your own Bible to compare the text with if you get lost in the &quot;ye&quot;s, &quot;thee&quot;s and &quot;thou&quot;s.  (Also, Newell contends that the KJV mistranslates some points; his explanation from the Greek is satisfactory to me, but you might want to compare with a KJV and an NIV/NASB.)<br />   Also, Newell comes from a dispensational perspective.  If I had known this at the beginning of his book, I would have understood some of his comments better.	2003-05-19

Considering that over half of American marriages end in divorce, it is surprising that so many Christian men take sexual impurity so lightly.  Maybe, like me, they think that if the physical part is under control, the mental and spiritual part can slide.  I found out that this is not true; a marriage requires inner and not just outer devotion in order to run the way it should.  \\"Every man's battle\\" primarily serves to remind men of the seriousness of sexual impurity, in action and in thought, and how a marriage can recover by taking determined action.  <br />I recommend this book because in addition to clearly presenting the stark picture of subtle infidelity, and powerfully presenting a determined program of explicit fidelity, it contains a chapter on cherishing your wife (which transcends simply \\"not doing wrong\\"; it's a change of the heart in addition to a change in thoughts and behavior).  This is the part that I struggle with the most, and the part that is the most essential for me to obey now.  I hope that every man considers what these authors have to say, because every woman deserves better than to be anything but first in her husband's heart, mind, and life.	2003-05-03

I think the best thing that most people can say is that it's better than &quot;Desecration&quot;.  I guess I would say to people looking to get into the series to stick to the first 6 books.  In &quot;Remnant&quot;, I at least had the feeling that time was progressing and that the characters seemed ... in character.  Also, there were some moments where I was just chilled by the results of the Antichrist's rule (and if the evening news can be chilling but the Antichrist isn't, look to poor writing!)  Anyway, I'm saying that &quot;Remnant&quot; is worth reading if &quot;Desecration&quot; and &quot;The Mark&quot; made you decide to quit.	2003-05-03

Lewis is remarkable in his depth of faith and logic while remaining consistently humble about his opinions.  Also, he purposefully avoids denominational battles or speaking on denominational doctrines, focusing on Christ instead.  When he discusses Christianity, he makes every effort to avoid advancing a denominational agenda and focuses on the things that unite Christians instead.  CS Lewis is a refreshing breeze to those who believe that we should be presenting a united front to the world.<br />Contents:<br />MERE CHRISTIANITY: An excellent exposition on the necessity of a good, personal God based on observational and philosophical evidence.  He then moves to an argument that Christ is a \\"personality\\" of that creator God and that Christianity follows \\"naturally\\" from what we have already acknowledged to be true.  His arguments are 100% as true and effective today as they were when written - I find myself using them today (and surprisingly, belief systems that portray themselves as more \\"rational\\" have not yet responded to these criticisms in the past 75 years or so...)<br />THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS: one can chillingly find the demon Screwtape's suggestions being carried out in our own actions on a regular basis.  CS Lewis has an intuition of human nature!<br />MIRACLES, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN: these two didn't thrill me, but we each respond to different things.  Lewis at least develops these ideas very well and that development was interesting.<br />THE GREAT DIVORCE: This was my favorite work.  Lewis displays once again a keen insight into human nature, set in the backdrop of arriving at Paradise from Purgatory and having to shed their old selves before they are willing to enter Heaven.<br />A GRIEF OBSERVED: This chronicles the spiritual journey of CS Lewis after his wife's [end of life].  It is very open and honest, and thus very painful to read.  Sometimes we benefit by reading of others' trials as well as their triumphs.<br />THE ABOLITION OF MAN: A fascinating analysis of post-modernism and where it will lead us.	2003-05-03

I can't imagine any Catholic reading this book and believing the material; unless you're a Catholic who is genuinely questioning the authority of your church this will only get your hackles up. Protestants who are strong in their faith don't need historical evidence to be convinced of their beliefs, so I am afraid that this book will only serve to poison your spirit against Catholic brothers and sisters.<br />To those very close to a Catholic: this book is immensely helpful in deciding what to believe. You are bomabarded constantly with Catholic claims to \\"catholicity\\"; that is, that Christ instituted only one church (naturally, the RCC) and that all Christians everywhere and for all time have believed exactly what the RCC says. Along the same lines, Reformation beliefs are johnny-come-lately's and that Protestants should return to the \\"real\\" church. This is the most difficult argument of Catholics to wrestle with, because Bible verses can be interpreted differently as can fruits of the Spirit but history is a fact. <br />Well, Webster blows the \\"catholic\\" argument out of the water. He has an easy job, because he doesn't have to show that Church Fathers would have been Protestant, merely that some beliefs of each father go against modern Catholicism. By quoting historical documents (which are extensively referenced), he shows that the early Church contained a mix of \\"Catholic\\" and \\"Protestant\\" beliefs (at best) or were entirely opposed to an idea like a papacy at the beginning. He admits that the doctrine of the Eucharist is the best supported historically, but even so, some authoritative writers explicitly supported views more like Calvin's on the topic. <br />I would say, then, that Webster succeeds in using his book to show that Reformation beliefs had support in the early Church and that the RCC is unjustified in dismissing Protestant beliefs as going against history, and that even some of its own beliefs contradict the statements of those it uses for support. Even if it does not convince, for whatever reason, a single Catholic, I am convinced that I should not be swayed by any claims of the RCC to sole ownership of history.	2003-05-03
US	52254254	R18UBU4AOGLAK6	0375708111	458870497	The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A fun read	You don't need to be a specialist to read this book; the author makes such a clear presentation that you might secretly wonder what is the problem with all these physicists who think this is difficult!  I think that most of this book's value comes from the autobiographical information describing the evolution of our understanding of string theory.  I would group it more with Richard Preston's works (&quot;The Hot Zone&quot;, &quot;The Demon in the Freezer&quot;) on my bookshelf than with Stephen Hawking's works.  Come to think of it, I am reminded strongly of James Gleick's &quot;Chaos: The Making of a New Science&quot;; it has the same prophetic, revolutionary tenor to it.  I would hardly expect Greene, as a string theorist, to say that he has wasted his life on a dead end, so of course I don't expect objectivity on that issue.  It's a fun read about a big &quot;possibly&quot;.	2003-03-23

The illustrations on how particle spin works were helpful for understanding what spin really &quot;means&quot;, and were certainly worth more than a thousand words.  On the downside, this book was not at the same level as &quot;A Brief History of Time.&quot;  The problem with most physics (&quot;the interesting stuff&quot;) is that to really talk about it requires a lot of background, and so by choosing breadth over depth Hawking is limited to merely mentioning topics of interest and showing some pictures (beyond the obligatory chapter on Einstein, which every popular physics book has).  The other problem I have with Hawking is that his research and opinions on theoretical topics are mentioned so often that I get the feeling that his books are being used as shills for his research, a feeling you'll understand if you know many string-theorists.  <br />In the final analysis, I believe that &quot;Nutshell&quot; is visual enough that most readers will be able to enjoy it.  If you know Hawking as that guy from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; where they set up an intellectual utopia, or if you're the parent of a physicist, this book is for you.  If you have any background in physics and are interested in the topics in &quot;Nutshell&quot;, you might try &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; by Brian Greene.  It is more in depth about relativity, strings, and &quot;p-branes&quot;.  I wouldn't say either is a better book; they are just written for different audiences.	2003-03-23
US	52254254	R37YDMESPVGLM4	0631215212	73240351	Reformation Thought: An Introduction	Books	3	1	7	N	Y	Who does this guy's proofreading?	I thought that this book served as a good introduction to the topics addressed.  I would have preferred more depth, less breadth, but it is an introduction.  Different ideas on justification, predestination, and the Lord's Supper were discussed in an accessible way.  I particularly benefited from seeing the opinions of less-well known reformers, as well as getting historical and social background.  The main detraction from this work was the prevalence of typographical errors.  It was difficult to take McGrath's academic opinions seriously when there were spelling errors on every other page!  If this bothers you, look for an updated edition.	2003-02-25
