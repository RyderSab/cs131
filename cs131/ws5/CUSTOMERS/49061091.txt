It's the beautifully written story of a young boy in the first decades of the 1900s, who leaves the only home he's ever known, an orphanage, to see the world.    Tobey's story is not all the book is about, however.  It also deals with abortion-- which was, of course, illegal during the time the book takes place-- and abortion's ethics.	2001-04-01

The two had a daughter together, and when they decided to go to Iran for a &quot;two-week vacation&quot; to visit family, Betty's husband decided they would not be returning to the United States.    Because in Iran women and children belong to the men, Betty was unable to leave the country; her husband controlled all their money.  She was unable to even have contact with her family in the US to ask for help leaving Iran.<br />   Her husband eventually agreed to let her go home, but on one condition: she leave her daughter with him.  She, of course, could never leave her child behind, so she, along with the help of a sympathetic shopkeeper, planned a dangerous from Iran to save herself and her daughter.	2001-04-01

It is fascinating and beautifully written and makes the reader think hard about the line between the &quot;sane&quot; and the &quot;insane.&quot;    As a manic depressive, I appreciated the book so much.  Susanna Kaysen writes about so many feelings that I've experienced, but have never been able to put into words.      We are so lucky that she has the ability and willingness to put these thoughts and feelings on paper for everyone to read.  Hopefully, this book will help people who haven't gone through similar things to understand what it's like to be told you're abnormal just because you don't fit into society's idea of what normal is.	2001-04-01

Of the three books (the other two being &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; and &quot;The Empty Chair&quot;) about these two detectives is by far the most wonderfully frightening of these three books, and my favorite by him so far.
