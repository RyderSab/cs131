Books	1	34	157	N	N	Another Slanted Rant from Regnery Publishing	Regnery makes a living out of publishing one side of the story.  This is red meat for its audience which seems to be much more conerned about having its \\"feelings\\" validated than getting all the facts. If you simply want propoganda to reaffirm your biases, Regnery provides it as in this book.  If you want to know the truth about Islam, warts and all, read Bernard Lewis.  He paints a picture that has many dark spots but keeps in context that 99% of Islam (like 99% of American gun owners) are law abiding and peaceful people.  Mr. Blankley would like to suggest otherwise, but lacking the facts to support such a view he cannot outright state it. So instead, he takes the acts of a few and seeks to create a general bias out of those acts in much the same US gun control advocates point to a small number of handgun abusers and seek to create bias against all gun owners. It ain't fair and it ain't right in eirther case.	2005-09-16

This one looks to be in trouble.  The plot is ok but the inner city girl who has a central role spouts dialog that is very weak and is not herself a believeable character.  The initial setup also strained my credulity.  So the book lost me when it should have been gripping me. <br />	2005-09-12

In that sense, much of this is Garp revisited.  But Irving is a storyteller.  He can tell stories better than anyone around (except, perhaps, Michael Chabon).  And he can write sentences and scenes that simply take your breath away. <br />I never felt the temptation to put this large book aside.  I never had a day when I did not want to get back in the story.  I often felt moved or forced to face things while reading it. <br />THE DOWN SIDE <br />First, I believe the word \\"penis\\" appears more often in this book than in all the other books of the world combined.  It is, I would say, penis-centric.  Nothing wrong with that in my world but it was a bit much. <br />Second, Irving rewrote the book to change the voice to 3rd person.  There are artifacts of that (annoying parantheticals and some back story that seems meant to explain a first person narrative. Irving is the best craftsman out there in my view and he (and his editor) missed some things here. <br />Third, he does a whole Hollywood gig which is clearly autobiographical and looks a little pompous. <br /> <br />I'd buy it and read it again.	2005-08-18

Seriously, why do people sit around and read propoganda? Michael Moore and Ann Coulter are the same person. They tell half-truths with the intent to distort reality so that they can convince people of their point of view.  Goldberg is not a dime different.  He's figured out that there are a million people out there who will buy any book that unilaterally supports their point of view and that in no way tries to provide context or perspective. This sort of behavior is inantile and ultimately allows extremists to rule, because the flow of information only supports their extreme views. <br />No intelligent person would spend a minute reading abook like this.	2005-07-28

In the America of 2005 in which ideology is too often put above rationality, reading an objective study of an emotional icon is refreshing.  Clinton's warts are exposed clearly and at some length.  But I think any open-minded reader will leave this book with greater respect for the man -- human though he is -- as an increasingly thoughtful and deeply caring human being.   <br />I will come back to this review page in a few days and I know I will see vile hatred spewed out by those who have not read the book. A brief note to them: if your dismissal of the book is based on your dislike of its subject and you have not read the book, then reflect for a moment on how weak your position is and spend the money and effort to find out the whole story.	2005-06-02

Flag burning is a great example. Conservative judges for a century have held that some conduct amounts to speech and is protected by the Fisrt Amednment.  Justice Scalia agreed with that in the flag burning case and so do the great majority of conservative jusrists.  What Mr. Levin really dislikes apparently is the First Amenment.  He apparently wants his fellow citizens to conform to his beliefs as the only politically correct views.  This radical and extremist position puts him in direct opposition to the Constitution he claims to be defending.  The book has one good purpose -- it would help start a really good fire.	2005-02-17

That's fine an certainly his roight and probably a good idea, but why dress it up as a thriller (it is verrry boring)? Why not just write that book?  Why do the extreme right wing feel obliged to engage in propoganda, dressing up one-sided arguments as entertainment?   <br />Treating this as Crichton would like, a serious discussion of global warming, the book still fails.  Crichton's premise is that global warming is not scientifically proven. That's argubale and he gives his side well and pays some attention to the opposing case, but his whole premise is deeply flawed.  The rightwing argument to ignore the effect of fossil fiels has always been argued from the position that the svience isn't solid. That's a red herring.  This is a public policy issue.  No one denies that fossil fuels posion the air and kill millions annually. An no one denies that if yoyu keep burning fuels you will add heat to the planet -- the argument is about the long term effect of the heat.  The problem with waiting for science to be settled on a long term  issue is that, if the environmentalists and the majority of scientists are correct on the science we do have, then if we wait for the final \\"scientific\\" answer, we will all be dead if the rightwingers are wrong.  If the leftwingers are wrong, we will have spent a lot of money but we'll be alive and healthier. <br />I like Crichton and am modestly sympathetic to the notion that popular culture accepts warming too readily, but the policy isue is much clearer than the science issue and should not be ignored as Crichton does in my view. <br />The other problem I have is Crichton's childish sniping at Hollywood types. Yeah, they are self-important jerks.  So is Tom DeLay.  Crichton chooses to live with them and work in their world and make gazzillionswith them.  His whining and victimhood do not interest me in the least.	2004-12-22

Michael Moore and Ann Coulter are the same person in different bodies.  They take half the story and make a few bucks off the suckers who want their biases fed.  It's a silly waste of time.  But a colleague at work suggested this and lent me his copy.  I was appalled.  Either the author is actually ignorant or, much worse, has chosen to leave out or give short shrift to the vital French role in the revolution, the French sacrifices and valor in WWI and the French underground in WWII. <br />This is the tactic that Goebbels used to defame the Jews -- list all the negatives and ignore the positives.  It is the tactic of the frightened and intellectually weak.  It is not the tactic of thoughtful or openminded people.  <br />So, if you'd just like to hate the french, go ahead and spend your money.  If you care about the facts, get a book that cares about the facts -- all the facts, as well.	2004-11-23

Like may geniuses he was erratic.  I cannot read Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  I find it Joycian in all the worst senses of that word.  But A Death in the Family is a different story. <br />If you read this and have the courage to really let it sink into you, you will feel the extraordinary pain of a family torn apart by a pedestrian but tragic event - an automobile crash. The shock hits you.  The grief overcomes you. You feel the loss. In short, you understand. That is what all artists strive to do and what Agee stunningly succeeds at here.  <br />The beauty here is the beauty of truth, mainlined slowly into your being.  This is a book that can and probably will change the reader. <br />Several reviews have mentioned the breathtaking prelude \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" and some mention the Samuel Barber soprano version of this.  To me that Barber piece ranks as one of the great American musical moments.  That two such enormous accomplishments should derive from one small book is a tribute to the power and brilliance of James Agee at his finest.	2004-11-19

General Franks was given 150,000 troops and years to execute one mission: get the man who killed 3000 Americans __ a 6'6\\" Arab on dialysis.  He failed.

One newspaper put it this way: \\"Several statements by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth directly contradict the Navy record of events and in some cases their own previous statements. Other statements are more opinion than fact based.\\" <br />If you hate Kerry and want propoganda to make you feel better, go ahead and read this. If you want the facts read the articles in the Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, NY Times and others who have exposed this tome for what it is: a deliberate smear of an honored vet sponsored and paid for by a major Bush supporter from Texas aided by two officials from the Bush campaign. <br /> <br />	2004-08-30

That is precisely Mr. O'Reilly's modus operandi and he, like they, does not seem to care much about the facts.  If you feel like a victim because your view of life is not accepted by the majority of Americans, read this book.  It is intended to make you feel that your sense of victimhood is justified.

This is the first and the last, but not the middle. It is well written, clear and often lively.  While more moving history, even more moving intellectual history, has been written, the book's clear depiction of the roots and meaning of Pragmatism and its extraordinary relevance to our times is something that every intelligent reader should delve into.  As we divide ourselves more and more in to ideological camps, holding on to opinion as if it were dogma, pragmatism offers a chance to come to sound ethical and moral conclusions while neither pretending omniscience nor abandoning the notion of absolute truth.  <BR>The icing on the cake is that the book is formed around a series of fascinating biographies.  Holmes, Jr has many biographers but he still one of the most interesting persons in Us history. Dewey, James. et al, lack the popular biographies but each is a memorable character as chronicled here.<BR>If \\"the unexamined life is not worth living\\" this is one of the books that will provide a basis for going on.	2003-02-26

It suggests some level of, how can I put this, Desperation? Cheating? Putting paint over rust? But I am probably some brain-washed person who gets all their information from a talk radio guy who makes up his facts.  If the book's point is that liberals have been wrong on some issues, then it simply states the obvious.  A more valuable book would make that point and also make the point, among other right wing fiascos, that the Reagan/Bush/Bush &quot;borrow today and live well and let our kids pay off the debt&quot; philosphy has fiscally and morally bankrupted America. <BR>This book is simply a one-sided view that will enrich the author at the expense of the Kool-Aid drinkers.	2003-02-14

All fundamentalist religions believe their view is correct and endorsed by God and therefore tend to think themselves entitled to impose their will on others.  Abortion clinic bombers and those who would deny fundamental rights to gays and lesbians are cut from the same cloth as those who think that Allah has determined the a narrow version of Islam should triumph.  Falwell and Pat Robertson are not bin Laden but they would both use the state to impose their religious ideology on the rest of us.

In my view it is the best such account since Coddington&quot;s Gettysburg: A Study in Command in the 1980s.  The focus is on the commanders below the Army and Corps levels.  This provides both fresh insights and new perspectives on old information.  The extended lead in to the campaign itself is a very valuable review of that parallel set of stumblings.  The reviewer who regrets that the emphasis was not on the commanders is accurate factually, but there are a dozen books that do that (and, worse, spend their time second guessing in some instances).  This book is not one of those and that is its virtue.<BR>One quibble others have noted.  The mapos are annoying often.  Sometimes they are quite small and often they do not cover the action you are reading about.  A suggestion that worked for me is to take the rather comprehensive map on page 142 and copy it and fold that into the back of the book for quick reference.  The publisher might do well to use this mao for endpapers in later editions.  It will save a lot of complaints.	2002-07-15

The pace is slow, the characters eventually real and the atmosphere very strong.  But there is something missing here also.  I think it is purpose. At the end I didn't care much about the people and I don't know that I should have.  I even think  the author may have intended me not to care.  He is an interesting writer but I belive that th reason one reviewer feels that he has read 50 books by him  already is that it is often derivative.  Chabon is in here (but comparisons with Chabon are way overdone).  There is even some Graham Swift in here.  But those are two authors who always make you care or give you comething to care about.

The premise of many of his proposals is that Big Government needs to be bigger and to actively interpose itself into decisions such as whether a married couple will stay together or not.

The police characters and many of the villagers are fully-realized, interesting and genuine.  The angle she has taken, a fictional &quot;true crime&quot; book is absorbing and not at all distracting.

He calls for courage in an age of ego, and that will make the comfortable uncomfortable. He does this with an extraordinarily lucid style and a modesty of manner that is as becoming as  it is effective.  Does he solve the problems of the world?  No.  But he  does articulate several of them with painful precision and he makes us  think.  Those are no small accomplishments.     Much has been made of the  author's age.  I have thirty years on him and I finished the book with some  old insights reinforced and some new and useful insights provided.  There  are few books by authors of any age that accomplish those tasks.  The focus  on age is an easy way to avoid the challenge he issues, but it does nothing  to diminish his arguments.
