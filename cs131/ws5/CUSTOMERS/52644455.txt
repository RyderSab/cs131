As the director of admission at Cal Berkely, Laird destroyed the lives of many black, Hispanic and Indian students. He admitted them to Cal even though he knew that they would never graduate unless, of course, there was a quota system for graduation.Severl years ago, PBS produced a program on the S.A.T. It showed that Laird's office admitted a black applicant who had never received a combined verbal and math score of more than 800, and rejcted a white applicant who's combined score was more than 1,350.Of course, this black had no chance of passing his freshman year at Cal unless there was a quota system for promotion. Laird's data are not credible and his inferences are not logical. The inarticulate major premises of Laird's argument is that blacks, Hispanics and Indians are intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. If you accept his premise, you will enjoy his book.	2005-08-27

Answer: the author Richard Bradley, not Harvard president Lawrence Summers.   Reason. The cause of the fear is that West might accuse Bradley of being a \\"racist\\" and ruin his career. If you are one of the Harvard faculty who hate Summers, you are probably afraid of West too. Some of you may have witnessed Bradley's fear and trembling on C-SPAN 2 when he discussed this book in the presence of West. He acted like a hostage in Iraq.   Truth. The truth is that Summers had the guts to stand up to West and Henry Gates. He rejected their racial fantacies because they could not cite any credible supporting evidence. He rejected the politicizing of a great university. He reaffirmed academic freedom. Of course, Bradley did not intend to make Summers look good. But the facts speak for themselves. Read the book in a bookstore, but don't buy it and enrich an author who is afraid of Cornel West.	2005-07-02

It is a response to the economic ideas of Hayek, and the economic policies Reagan and Thatcher. The triumph of those ideas and policies was described in 3The Commanding Heights2 by Yergin and Stanislaw. <br />The author is a young Cambridge professor. Like Princess Di, she wants to do good, but has no realistic idea how to do so in a global economy. On February 19, 2003 she appeared on the 3Charlie Rose Program2. Her statements and demeanor reflected a lack of intellectual gravitas. An apt description of her would be 3white heartj, but empty head2.<br />Her arguments have no basis in fact or accepted economic principles. For example, she alleges that one-in-five children in America are hungry. But the truth is that one-in-five may be overweight, but not hungry. Her allegations about the environment are also not supported by credible evidence. <br />Her arguments that multi-national corporations are superseding national governments is not persuasive. As a leftist, she is unable or unwilling to acknowledge the essential link between democratic values and free marker values. In a democracy, the people as voters decide the conditions under which a multi-national corporation can operate. In a market economy, the people as consumers decides what goods and services they wants. In both situations, the people, not central planners, make the decisions.<br />The author is a redistributionist. If the purpose of her book is to provide a theoretical basis for redistributing the wealth of nations, she has failed to achieve it.	2003-02-21

The author chose to study for a master¹s degree at MIT instead of Harvard because MIT was ³merit-oriented² (p 51). Unlike Harvard, at MIT, ³If you can¹t produce, you¹re history². (p. 115). As supporting evidence, the author provides a diary of his successes and failures during his three years at MIT. He works very hard. He earns a master¹s degree, but does not qualify for the PhD program. He does learn how to think, how to solve engineering problems. Along the way, some of his friends jump or are pushed out of school. One good friend commits suicide.  His only criticism is that MIT should be more human.<br />Of course, there is the stereotypical black professor who argues that, ³MIT is a racist, sexist institution.² (p 194). As evidence, the professor alleges that when he was an undergraduate some white professor rejected his project notebook because he was black. and that he threw the notebook in a bon fire and cried while it burned. In his prejudiced mind, there was no possibility that his notebook lacked merit. He also tacitly accuses the author of racism because the author asked him a difficult question during a stump-the-professor session. This professor is a master at playing the race card. But I doubt that even he would fly in an aircraft that was engineered by a person whose only qualification was membership in a racial and ethnic minority group.<br />This book proves that at MIT, ³merit² is not a dirty word. Maybe that¹s why MIT is arguably the best engineering school in the world.	2003-01-06

His family was lower middle class and lived in the San Francisco Bay area.  At a public high school, he became all-everything. He attended Yale from 1953-57 where he became good friends with the author, Bud Trillin. There, he was a fifties hero: scholar-athlete, a student leader. and all-around good guy. He was a member of swim team, Deke fraternity and the Elizabethan Society. During his senior year, he was tapped by Scroll and Key. He graduated magna cum laude and was admitted to Phi Betta Kappa. Life Magazine published a photo essay about his graduation. He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and studied two years at Magdalen College at Oxford. He received a master¹s degree from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, Not bad for a young man with his background.<br />Denny Hansen became Roger D. Hansen. On the career level, he worked briefly in broadcasting, the State Department and at the National Security Council in the Carter administration. He wrote several books on foreign policy that were widely praised. But the Foreign Service rejected his application. Eventually, he was appointed to a chair at the Johns-Hopkins¹ School for Advanced International Studies in Washington. He was a member of the Cosmos Club and the Council on Foreign Relations. On a personal level, Roger never married. He became estranged from his family, his relationships with a few women soured, he gradually alienated his friends from Yale. He became a chronic complainer. He became very depressed. But he always defended right conduct. Near the end of his life, he lived a clandestine gay lifestyle. He bequeathed his pension to his former girl friend, and the remainder of his \\"huge\\" estate to Yale. <br />What caused Roger to commit suicide in 1991?. His friends and colleagues offer various explanations. During conversations after Roger¹s death, his Yale friends discovered that they did not know Roger and may have never really known Denny. Trillin¹s  explanation is that because of ³poisonous template of the fifties², Roger could not accept his sexual orientation. A reader can interpret his explanation as an attack on values of the Fifties. To me, the most persuasive explanation is an application of the backpack analogy. When a boy is born, he is wearing a backpack. Other people put their heroic expectations for him in the backpack. The more the boy succeeds, the more expectations are put in the backpack and the heavier it gets. Eventually, the loan becomes unbearable and the boy reaches a crisis. In Roger¹s case, instead of emptying the backpack, he chose to kill himself. He had a house, but not a home. Remember, the line from a Robert Frost poem, \\"Death of the Hired Man\\"., ³Home is the place where, when you have to go there,/ They have to take you in.² Neither Denny nor Roger had a place where they had to take him in. <br />The details of the book are fascinating. Trillin describes college life at Yale during the 1950s and the careers of many of Denny¹s classmates and friends.. Of course, Trillin¹s writing is excellent: clear, powerful and sometimes humorous.  In a way, the book is a mid-20th Century sequel to Owen Johnson¹s Stover at Yale. <br />Trillin suggests that the ³poisonous template of the fifties² was the major cause of Roger¹s death in 1991. But change is not equivalent to progress. Sex does not explain everything. Each reader must decide for himself whether, based on the circumstantial evidence, the template of the Fifties enabled Roger to carry his backpack of expectations for more than 30 years, or whether it was the templates of later decades that poisoned the golden boy from California with the million dollar smile.	2002-12-22

The author dresses up Wesleyans discriminatory practices for consumption and approval by liberals. But the results of both practices are the same: racial classifications. The book is a dictionary of liberal code words for their brand of racial discrimination. Oh, but the liberals claim that their brand of racial discrimination is benign. But tell that to the more qualified white applicant who was rejected in favor of a less qualified black. All racial discrimination is malignant.

For example, the author reports that former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Eddie Jordan, had a videotape of Gov. Edwards delivering a $20,000 bribe to former U.S. Representative Cleo Fields (D LA). Over the objection of his staff, Jordan declined to prosecute Fields or Edwards because , in his opinion, the evidence was insufficient. The Clinton Justice Department did not overrule Jordan's decision. How much more evidence did Jordan need? The real reason that Jordan decl;ined prosecution is that Fields and U.S. Representative William Jefferson (D LA) were both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Jefferson and Jordan worked together in the same law office. Jordan could not prosecute his enemy, Edwards. without prosecuting his friend, Fields. The bitter irony of Edwards' criminal activity is that the U.S. Court of Appeals will probably reverse his conviction on legitimate grounds. Both the prosecutors and the trial judge overreached by dismissing during jury deliberations the only juror who was voting for acquittal and by ministrepreting the RICO statute.

The author, known in New Orleans as Buddy D, is not competent to write an objective account of the New Orleans Saint. He was formerly an objective and well respected sports journalist. In the last few years, that has changed. He is now the mouthpiece for Tom Benson, the owner of the Saints. Every night on Buddy Ds radio call-in program, he insults callers who criticize Benson or the Saints. His knowledge of football is based on his interest in gambling. Several times a week, he broadcasts from casinos in New Orleans and on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. He knows more about the morning line on Saints games. than about the nuances of professional sports. In short, he is more like Jimmy-the-Greek than Red Smith, Grantland Rice, or Dave Anderson.<BR>3. The photos in the book are good. But as you might have expected, the photographer is employed by the Saints<BR>4. This book appears to be part of Bensons scheme to keep the Saints in New Orleans at taxpayer expense. Benson, a multi-millionaire, is like Citizen Kane. His delusions of grandeur are monumental. He promises to keep the Saints in the city if the State of Louisiana will build him a new $450 million stadium at a site he has selected. He argues that keeping the Saints in New Orleans will induce Fortune 500 companies to relocate to the city. But he ignore the fact that although the Saints have been playing in New Orleans for 33 years, not a single Fortune 500 company has relocated to New Orleans and several have moved out of the city. I doubt that this book will persuade the Legislate or a Fortune 500 company to act..<BR>5. I you like spending your money on propaganda, this is the book for you.	2001-11-02

In Chapters 1 - 6, the author makes practical suggestions for succeeding in college. The most important of these are developing writing skills, participating in extracurricular activities, and connecting with professors. These suggestions are well worth the discounted price of the book.<br />But in Chapters 7 - 9, the author makes a political pitch for ³diversity², i.e. racial quotas, affirmative action, and political correctness. His evidence does not support his assertions. He lumps all minorities together. But Asian students neither need nor want special treatment. The author misclassifies all students of Hispanic decent as ³Latinos² even though Hispanics students from Cuba or South America are materially different from those from Mexico or Puerto Rico. Apparently, all ³Latinos² look alike to him. <br />Stripped of the political rhetoric, the author is referring to black students. , The underlying major premise of his argument is that black students have a right to special treatment. He ignores the fact that such preferences are unlawful and unconstitutional. He accepts the racial fantasies of Henry Louis Gates and other black radical professors at Harvard. <br />This would have been a better book if the author had limited his discussion to education. His argument that a good education means acceptance of the values of the left wing of the Democratic Party is rubbish.	2001-09-12

The grammar rules are short and clear. The text is succincct and relevant. If Congress and the Courts would follow these simple rules, the laws and decisions would be easier to understand. This ... book is better than all the overpriced and overwritten textbooks used in elementary and secondary schools.	2001-08-23

But the book focuses more on Archie and Peyton than on Cooper and Eli. Inexplicably, the book has neither a table of context nor an index.	2000-10-16

Author wants to substitute class quotas in place of racial quotas. Results would be the same: unfair, divisive, unworkable. An example of Justice Holmes' statement  that, &quot;It is one thing to think from a protected cloister; it is  another to think for action upon which great interests depend&quot;. Author  should climb down from his ivory tower and get a real job.	1999-12-05

The author is unbelievably self-centered and arrogant. His descriptions of  some law professors and law firms are good. But the lingering question is  why Senator Charles Robb of Virginia hired a guy like this.	1999-11-24
