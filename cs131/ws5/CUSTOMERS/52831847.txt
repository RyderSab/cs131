But they are incredible mind-candy and difficult to put down.  There's also a heck of a lot of them, and given that they weren't written in a chronology synchronous with the chronology of Sharpe's exploits, it takes a little running around to read them in order.<br /><br />Having begun with Sharpe's Tiger, it seems to me to be the best place to start - introducing the reader to Sharpe himself, the execrable Obadiah Hakeswill, Mr. Lawford, and Wellington.  It is interesting to see how Cornwell starts to lose track of certain details as the novels skip around in time, but he's written so much that it is certainly hard to keep track of everything.<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion that Bernard Cornwell is another nom-de-plume for Stephen King, given the prolixity of his work and the none-too-subtle repetitive patterns of each book. I won't know for sure until Richard Sharpe comes out in favor of abortion and against nuclear energy.  If the authors are one and the same, then Mr. King has found another way to extract my hard earned money.<br /><br />Anyway - great entertainment!  But the kind of books that make me wonder why I don't just get a library card.	2005-10-13

But in \\"God and the World\\", Cardinal Ratzinger displays an amazingly intrinsic faith, one that encompasses the complexities of theology and history, while never being separated from the personal and central Christian relationship.<br /><br />In respect to Peter Seewald, his questions were far more nuanced in \\"God and the World,\\" and reflected thorough study in preparation for the interview.  The tone of the book is much broader than \\"Salt of the Earth,\\" but no less sensational.  Seewald attempts to address the controversies of faith, spending a great deal of time sketching the debate over the role of women in the Church, but is not hesitant to bring in lengthy questions that are more \\"mood setting\\" than actually interrogative.  An excellent example of this is in Chapter 11 \\"The Truth\\", in which Seewald's three paragraph \\"comment\\" on the Paternal model of God prompts Cardinal Ratzinger's two page response on human relationships and why the father-son relationship is intrinsic to our experience of God.<br /><br />I have learned to read Cardinal Ratzinger's works with a pencil in hand, and to dog-ear the pages when necessary.  This became self-defeating when reading God and the World, as so many pages are now dog-eared that my efforts to flip to a desired section are frustrated.  Still, a few sections stand out.<br /><br />First among these is Cardinal Ratzinger's treatment of transubstantiation and communion.  While the entirety of the discussion is worthwhile and provocative, I was moved by the Cardinal's assertion that with the Eucharist \\"Jesus is saying here that it is the opposite to how it is with ordinary food that your body assimilates.  That food is lesser than you, so that it becomes a part of your body.  And in my case, it is the other way around: I assimilate you into me. I am the stronger, you will be assimilated into me... And that is what is really happening in Communion, that we allow ourselves to be drawn into him, into his inner communion, and are thus led finally into a state of inner resemblence\\"<br /><br />There is one \\"moneychangers in the temple\\" moment with Cardinal Ratzinger, which comes during a discussion of liturgical abuses.  The Cardinal is passionate in his response: \\"They should perform their ministry in a spirit of service to this living and growing entity that brings to us the faith of all the centuries, and not want to invent and manufacture something better, like experts who are almighty in and of themselves... What is being offered here is certainly the work of a few clever and hard-working people who have made something up.  But what I encounter in that is no longer the Wholly Other, the Holy One being offered to me, but rather the cleverness and hard work of a few people.  And I notice that that is not what I am looking for.  It's too little, and it's something else.\\"<br /><br />And regarding the indult for the Tridentine (or the Novus Ordo Latin Missal): \\"I must say, quite openly, that I don't understand why so many of my episcopal brethren have to a great extent submitted to this rule of intolerance, which for no apparent reason is opposed to making the necessary inner reconciliations within the Church\\"<br /><br />But clear and faithful responses fill the book.  It is a worthy successor to \\"Salt of the Earth\\", and provides a glimpse into Cardinal Ratziger's self that is somewhat different from his own writings.And that is what is really happening in Communion, that we allow ourselves to be drawn into him, into his inner communion, and are thus led finally into a state of inner resemblence\\" <br /> <br />There is one \\"moneychangers in the temple\\" moment with Cardinal Ratzinger, which comes during a discussion of liturgical abuses.

But in the end I did something I almost never do - I put the book down without finishing it.<br /><br />First, I feel I need to come to Peart's defense, having read a number of the existing reviews of this book.  Yes, Neil comes across as arrogant, boorish, and trite.  His observations reveal an elitism that is a strange combination of being Canadian, brilliant, and independently wealthy.  His disdain for Americans fills the chapters of his travels in the US.  It's particularly interesting to see how enraptured he is by getting glimpses of \\"the real Mexico\\" and he is ebulliant in his praise of the strength of Mexican culture.  On the other hand, it is in Mexico that he encounters real fear.  This being said, however, Mr. Peart is worthy of respect for his unflinching honesty.  Most of us, given the opportunity to write a book about our lives, would never dream of revealing the depths of our personalities to the extent that Mr. Peart does, precisely becuase most of us carry the same prejudices and cultural biases that pervade Ghost Rider.<br /><br />And, of course, the adventures and cultural observation are the backdrop for Peart's real story, the effort to find a way to live after the tragedies that beset him.  Now, I admire Peart's rationalist philosophy, while pitying him for suffering under its deficiencies.  But it is a frustrating experience to read his efforts to cope.<br /><br />This is one of the great flaws of the book.  Peart never fully communicates the depths of his loss (how could he?).  But then he charges off on his motorcycle, taking the reader along.  We are distracted when he is distracted, and reminded when he is reminded.  But lacking the ballast of the emotional tragedy (again, never successfully related), it is hard to appreciate any healing he is experiencing.<br /><br />Rather, the real catharsis seems to be more related to the travails of his biker buddy, jailed for drug smuggling about 1/3 of the way through the book.  It is almost as if having a further loss, but one that is \\"secondhand\\", helps him get his bearings and moves his focus away from the past to the present.<br /><br />But this event is also the bane of the story, for Peart begins to tell his story through his letters to his jailed friend, and although he does his best to let us in on the inside jokes, they, of course, are always inside jokes.  After Peart's return from Mexico, the flood of letters becomes insufferable and the book becomes virtually unreadable.  More trenchant souls than I have pushed on through to the end, and report a sudden re-emergence of \\"Neil Peart\\" from his cocoon of sorrow.

US	52831847	RTM0B0NQILHBW	0847827615	190398942	Memory and Identity: Conversations at the Dawn of a Millennium	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Worthy, Thoughtful and Introspective	Memory and Identity is a very personal book, not really what I expected of it, but certainly further evidence of John Paul II's brilliance and unique calling.<br /><br />Throughout the work, John Paul's personalist philosophical outlook permeates his view of history, and our place in it as we enter the third millenium.  He accomplishes, for example,  a wonderfully concise overview of ethics by distilling the platonic/aristotlean/thomist ethic, the utilitarian ethic, and the kantian/post-modern ethic into three complementary goods.  While I wonder at his inclusion of Sartre among respected philosophers, it is clear that John Paul approached his theology through philosophy, rather than vice versa.  I begin to understand the recent proposal that \\"John Paul was a Thomist and Benedict XVI is an Augustinian\\".  In this sense, John Paul's writing is slightly distant, which is unusual given his enormous personal charisma.<br /><br />The closing chapter, in which John Paul II and his secretary,  Archbishop Dsiwisz recount the attempt on the pope's life, is a thought-provoking new look.  The revealed details about the pope's meeting with his would be assassin is fascinating.<br /><br />I was a little unprepared for the depth of Polish patriotism that permeated the book.  It is not something I begrudge, and certainly of pivotal importance.  Perhaps this is John Paul II's final gift, an effort to encourage Europe and the world to recognize the contributions that Poland has made to western civilization.<br /><br />It is in the conversations about Europe that John Paul II's Memory & Identity seem to flow most naturally into the mission of Pope Benedict.  John Paul makes an excellent point about the debt which the \\"colonized\\" parts of the world (the Americas, Africa, Asia) owe for Europe's evangelism.  John Paul views the gift of the Gospel and the Church as a great counterweight against the evils of colonialism (and rightly so), and hints that maybe someday, the world will have to repay the debt by evangelizing a secular Europe.<br /><br />Regarding the European spirit, culture, and the EU, John Paul points out that \\"The French are not afraid of ceasing to be French by virtue of entry into the European Union...\\" a statement which seems to be contradicted by the rejection of the EU constitution by the French, not long after the Pope's death (or the publication of this book).  This, and other statements, led me to wonder whether John Paul II's relationship with Europe was as fully formed as his relationship with Poland.  Other statements, such as a slightly inflated view of the power of \\"market forces\\" and an a priori respect for culture/nation that borders on cultural relativism, hint at a worldview formed behind the iron curtain.  Not to imply that John Paul was pro-socialist, or pro-communist, but that he never seemed to trust \\"the West\\" (and, one could argue, with good reason!).<br /><br />John Paul makes excellent points regarding national identity, which we would be well advised to consider.  Particularly related to the value (or lack thereof) of democracy in the absence of a national identity, the risk of democracy's transformation into tyranny, and the key differences betwen patriotism and nationalism.<br /><br />And, of course, through the book John Paul keeps us properly focused on God as the root to all human relations and self-awareness: \\"Without the Gospel, man remains a dramatic question with no adequate answer.\\"<br /><br /> In closing, I must cite two key passages:<br /><br />\\"Care for the needy is incomparably more important than polemics and denunciations concerning, for example, the role of the Enlightenment in paving the way for the great historical catastrophes of the twentieth century.  The spirit of the Gospel is seen primarily in this willingness to offer fraternal help to those in need\\"<br /><br />\\"If [the Church] encounters obstacles, if she is criticized in various ways - maybe accused of so-called proselytism or trying to clericalize social life - she should not be discouraged.  Most of all, she should not cease to proclaim the Gospel.  Saint Paul was already aware of this when he wrote to his disciple: 'Proclaim the message, be persistant whether the time is favorable or unfavorable, convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching.'\\"<br /><br />All lessons taught well during the long and fruitful pontificate of John Paul the Great.ed proselytism or trying to clericalize social life - she should not be discouraged.

This book wonderfully summarizes Catholic teaching and tradition, particularly by tackling modernist and traditionalist approaches to the sacrament.<br /><br />The first article, \\"God with Us and God among Us\\" serves as a nice introduction to the other \\"chapters\\" in this collection, meditating upon one line in the profession of faith, and speaking directly to the Incarnation.<br /><br />\\"God's Yes and His Love...\\" approaches the issue of the sacrifice Jesus made, and how it relates to the sacrificial character of the Mass.  Cardinal Ratzinger addresses Christ's self-abasement for our salvation, and contrasts this against our false humility, self-limitation in freely offered grace, and suffering as a characteristic of the Church.<br /><br />\\"The Wellspring of Life...\\" explores the exegetic similarities between the opening of Christ's side at His crucifixion and the removal of flesh from Adam's side in Genesis.  Along the way, Cardinal Ratzinger explores the unity of the Church, and the atemporal communion encapsulated in the Eucharist, and again touches upon the issues of sacrifice.<br /><br />In \\"Banquet of the Reconciled\\", the polar extremes in the discourse on liturgical evolution are examined, quite calmly and reasonably.  Cardinal Ratzinger utilizes I Corinthians as the basis for a reasoned response to those who want to reduce the Mass to a simple meal of friendship and community, as well as to those who see any alteration of the form of the Mass as heretical and invalid.  Along the way, he makes excellent points concerning the proper reception of communion (in the hand or on the tongue, kneeling or standing), the use of the vernacular and the origins of the Eucharistic prayers, and preparation of one's heart for receiving the sacrament.<br /><br />\\"The Presence of the Lord...\\" deals with transubstantiation, the Real Presence, the resurrection of the body, and the importance of Eucharistic Adoration.  Similar themes are explored in \\"The Immediacy of the Presence of the Lord\\", and later in \\"Standing before the Lord\\"<br /><br />\\"The Lod is Near Us\\" is remarkable for insights into our relationship with the Law, in such writing as \\"The law became a burden the moment it was no longer being lived out from within but was broken down into a series of obligations external in their origin and their nature.\\"<br /><br />A series of shorter articles follows, but the book is concluded by two profound chapters: \\"The Church Subsists as Liturgy...\\" treats the importance of the Eucharist and the liturgy to the very lives of man, arguing that life's meaning can only be found by seeking to live in God's community.  The Cardinal emphasizes the modern mentality that subconsciously rejects the efficacy of faith and prayer, really believing only in our own power to affect our lives.<br /><br />The final chapter \\"My Joy is to Be in Thy Presence\\" is a worhty capstone to this remarkable book, addressing our modern disdain for the very concepts of immortal life with God.  The themes sounded in this article can be heard clearly in Pope Benedict's inaugural homily and the broad vision he is expounding for his papacy.  I can only related the beauty of Cardinal Ratzinger's vision in quotes from this work: \\"Eternal life steadily withdraws from a person whose attention is fixed on himself,\\" \\"the idea of eternity appears to us like being condemned to boredom,\\" \\"The struggle to keep evil under control, within limits, has to be taken up a new by each generation and can never be removed by the institutional arrangements of an earlier generation,\\" \\"We should finally bid farewell to the notion of working to build the ideal society of the future as being a myth and should instead work with total commitment to strengthen those factors that hold evil at bay in the present...\\" \\"man is that creature in which spirit and material meet together and are united as a single whole\\"...<br /><br />Through the course of these articles, Cardinal Ratzinger touches upon dualism, utilitarianism, the Reformation, unitarianism, the meaning of life, transubstantiation, heaven, hell, purgatory, utopian rational secularism, the communion of saints, grace, salvation, the person of Christ, Christ as God's Word, as Logos, etc., etc., etc.  For a brief, small book, its scope and impact are immeasurable.meet together and are united as a single whole\\"... <br /> <br />Through the course of these articles, Cardinal Ratzinger touches upon dualism, utilitarianism, the Reformation, unitarianism, the meaning of life, transubstantiation, heaven, hell, purgatory, utopian rational secularism, the communion of saints, grace, salvation, the person of Christ, Christ as God's Word, as Logos, etc., etc., etc.  For a brief, small book, its scope and impact are immeasurable.	2005-06-09

Pell's rise in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church has been meteoric, and particularly pivotal for Australia.  Were he slightly older, I believe Pell would have been \\"papabile\\" in the most recent conclave.<br /><br />The tone of Livingstone's work is somewhat apologetic.  As an American, I was familiar with Cardinal Pell through his writings in First Things and through his reputation in First Thing's pages.  I was unaware of the degree to which he has been excoriated in Australia.  Before reading Livingstone's work, I imagined Pell to be a sort of \\"Ratzinger Down Under.\\"  Now I have a more nuanced appreciation of the Cardinal - his work bears similarity to Msgr. Levada of San Francisco, the new prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  That is, he is not the archconservative Tridentine-Mass loving 1950's priest that his critics (or supporters) would have one believe, but a priest, bishop, and cardinal who takes his faith very seriously but reconciles a respect for dogma and tradition with a genuine love for his fellow Catholics.<br /><br />The defensiveness of the book is understandable considering the assault that Pell was under when the book was written.<br /><br />One intiguing aspect of the book is that of the unfamiliar Aussie syntax.  Many of Pell's statements are slightly confusing - he seems to be saying something inconsistent with the context in which it is placed by the author.  At times it is necessary to read Pell's statements a few times before appreciating the particular Aussie expression.<br /><br />I was also taken aback by the degree of Pell's involvement with \\"social justice\\".  Pell's comments on American actions in southeast Asia were somewhat disconcerting.  It is as if the American left-wing view of Vietnam/Laos/Cambodia found a stronger long-term purchase in Australia than it did in America.<br /><br />All told, Livingstone's work is a valuable introduction to Pell, a figure with whom discerning Catholics should familiarize themselves.<br /> <br />All told, Livingstone's work is a valuable introduction to Pell, a figure with whom discerning Catholics should familiarize themselves.	2005-05-22

It was delicious and over too quickly.  The few other works of Chesteron's that I have read are much meatier, much more profound.  But Chesterton always seems to be able to take a brief, clever idea, and follow it through to its logical conclusions.<br /><br />The insanely secular world Chesterton paints in \\"The Ball & the Cross\\" is present in Manalive, but it has been mercifully suspended outside of the confines of Beacon House.  This suspension allows Chesterton to explore the actions of a single man who is fully and completely human - an uninhibited man with a good heart and relatively infinite resources.<br /><br />Within the confines of Beacon House, Chesterton assembles a cast of English cartoon figures  to serve as foils to his protagonist.  Their lighthearted attempt to make sense of \\"Smith\\" provides the structure around which Chesterton makes his points.<br /><br />Chesterton's disdain for Americans makes its appearance in Dr. Cyrus Pym, but GKC can be forgiven for this since he equips his hero Smth with a fine American revolver.<br /><br />All in all an excellent book, over too quickly, but consequently well suited for repeated readings.	2005-04-11

Surpasses Screwtape Letters	It has come as a surprise to me how few people have read \\"the Great Divorce\\" in comparison with \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\"  Nevertheless, I consider the former to be Lewis' masterpiece, given the obscurity of the subject matter and the sublimity with which he handles it.<br /><br />The Great Divorce is pure conjecture, and Lewis makes it clear that no-one should take his imagery of heaven & hell to be informative.  But it is in the way that Lewis grapples with the central tenet of Christianity that stands out above all else.<br /><br />It is one thing to cite the commandments, or paint an image of man beset by temptations and personified evil.  It is another to address apologetically the reasons for accepting Christianity and Christ.  But Lewis' genius in The Great Divorce is to make it clear what \\"Love of God\\" really means - in its many forms.<br /><br />It is almost impossible in our conceptions of the afterlife to put aside our sole plane of reference - ourselves.  The very concept of communion is alien to us.  Our linkages with other people, no matter how profound the relationships, are shallow compared with the depth of divine Love.  And yet Lewis manages to catch hold of the edge of the beatific vision, perhaps in his metaphor of substantiality.<br /><br />The Great Divorce is thus one of those books that ought to be read once a year - perhaps a few days after Easter Sunday, for a reminder of what we ought to value above all else.	2005-04-11

Not that I would have figured it out on my own...<br /><br />If you haven't read TMWWT before, I suggest you skip over Gardner's introduction and dive right in.  Then go back and read Gardner's introduction and afterword to see if you've caught Chesterton's meaning.  Granted, the text of the book doesn't go to any lengths to make its allusions unmistakable.  Without Gardner and Chesterton's explanations, I believe you could take Sunday about any way you liked, somewhat like the Old Monk Michael in \\"The Ball and the Cross\\".<br /><br />While the foreword and afterword are thorough and interesting, Gardner's annotations through the text are a bit of a mixed bag.  Sometimes he rambles on over two pages of footnotes, bringing in ancillary details about London notables who lived near the setting of the action.  Other times he waxes eloquent about scientific principles tangentially related to Chesterton's story.  While many of his footnotes are exceedingly helpful, others are just weird.  It appears, for example, that Gardner is a big Sherlock Holmes fan, given the relatively large presence that Holmes has in the footnotes.<br /><br />Anyway - a great book with a worthy annotation.	2005-04-11

I read it, however, for a more in depth understanding of the sacrament of Confession (or Reconciliation, or Penance, or Absolution).<br /><br />I have several scattered thoughts about this book...<br /><br />I was fairly happy in my ignorance before, or at least I thought I was.  The \\"supersize value meal\\" salvation that permeates the Bible belt must have snuck into my theology.  Hahn, however, punctures the bubble of assumed/assured salvation and forces you to ask some serious questions that can be summed up in two statements:<br /><br />1) In what way can Man ever recompense Heaven? (hint: he can't)<br /><br />2) Could we condemn our own children?<br /><br />Leaving aside (for the moment), questions of simultaneous justification and redemption, grace & conversion, and TULIP...<br /><br />Hahn's exploration of the topic of Confession is much needed and much appreciated.  It's not an easy topic for Roman Catholics.  We seem to be caught between the stern but defensible strictures of the Baltimore Catechism, and the easy-going, new-age, I'm OK you're OK, sandal-wearing, no-hail-mary's-for-you, post-Vatican II AmChurch.  Hahn helps reduce this tension by examining the basic import and necessity of Confession.<br /><br />In a Catholic who most resonates with the Confiteor & \\"Domine, non sum dignus...\\", Hahn's book has helped prompt a slightly more frequent trek to the Confessional, and regardless of how difficult that might be, it's ultimately a good thing.	2005-04-11

As a contrast to Edmund Morris' execrable \\"Dutch\\" (biography of Ronald Reagan), Weigel's \\"Witness To Hope\\" refuses to accept or gloss over the seeming contradictions embodied by John Paul II.  In its intense analysis, it provides a plausible mechanism for understanding the Pope and his corresponding impact on the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's also an awful lot of material.  The potential for seeing John Paul II's hand in every Vatican action means analyzing every Vatican action - an insurmountable task, but one which the latter stages of the book seem to be engaged in.<br /><br />Weigel does an excellent job maintaining the many threads of John Paul II's papacy - the timeline of his life (most engaging!), the course of his papacy, the evolution of his philosophy and theology, John Paul II as post Vatican II pope, the global impact of his papacy, and various spheres of impact.  Weigel can't keep all these balls in the air, but he does a remarkable job considering the task.<br /><br />After I've read a few books on personalism, reviewed the archives of the second Vatican council, and read all of John Paul II's encyclicals myself, I'd like to come back to Witness To Hope again.  This book is not the simple biography I expected, but a thorough and scholarly work, surely setting the bar for the massive future interest in St. John Paul the Great.	2005-04-11

I am continuously amazed at the genius of these beleaguered Englishment - Chesterton, Lewis, Belloc, Tolkien, et al.  While the Ball and the Cross doesn't quite rival Lewis' Screwtape Letters in sheer creativity, it does tackle a more subtle theme.<br /><br />Chesterton's comedic conflict in the triad of Christian/Atheist/Society is heavily relevant to today's Christian/Muslim/Secularist conflict, which I would argue is the defining tension driving world events.  It is curious to see how even diametrically opposed Believers can ally against Disbelief or Apathy, or to see how seriously the Agnostic or Apathetic take the threat of sincere Belief.<br /><br />I was a little stunned by Chesterton's luddite streak as it is expressed in the Devil and his machines, although this is not a surprise considering the turn-of-the-century changes in England, and would seem quite prescient over the next few decades of Total War.  Still, given the modern secular alliance with neo-pagan nature-worship, I would probably draw the Devil hugging a tree rather than piloting an airship.<br /><br />In all a rousing, entertaining jaunt through Chesterton's imagination and philosophy.  I agree with other reviewers that Martin Gardner's Foreword should be read Afterward, but it is of great value and well written, and should not be skipped.	2005-02-06

To her credit, she admits to her butchery of the text.  As cited by other reviewers, she provides a list of the words that she changed; Lord to Beloved, devil to \\"spirit of evil,\\" sin with \\"missing the mark,\\" etc.<br /><br />However, all her semantics serve to do is to force the reverse translation by the reader, and it grew quickly tiresome to mentally exchange \\"Lord\\" for every instance of \\"Beloved.\\"  Not to mention the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Starr had monkeyed with the text to a greater extent than she admits.  But, again, you have to admire Ms Starr's honesty in her statement that \\"[Teresa] would have approved of my boldness, if not the results.\\"  This amounts to an admission by Ms Starr that her modifications substantially change the meaning of Teresa's text.<br /><br />Despite all the linguistic hijinks, Starr's translation of the Interior Castle is not \\"Free of Dogma\\" as is its claim.  The concept of the soul is dogma.  The redemptive suffering of Christ is dogma.  Teresa's  patterns of prayer and life are rooted in dogma.  To attempt to pen a \\"dogma-free Interior Castle\\" is like attempting to write a \\"math-free Calculus\\".<br /><br />What the attempt to \\"free Teresa from the cage of Christianity\\" reveals is a complete denial of Teresa's life and devotion.  Whatever pressures Teresa may have felt at the hands of the inquisitors and the Church heirarchy, Teresa was voluntarily a Carmelite and she deeply believed in all sorts of inconvenient things.  Teresa cannot be separated from Christianity - nor can she be separated from Catholicism.<br /><br />In the end, far from being dogma-free and modernized, Starr's interpretation of Teresa's Interior Castle is simply castrated, lobotomized, sterile, and confused.	2005-02-06

On the one hand, us post-Vatican II Catholics don't really have a good feel for the interests of the pre-Vatican II world.  The staggering number of Latin phrases referencing sexual activity is a pretty strong indicator of the amount of time spent by theologians on this subject (although why theologians should be any different from the rest of the world is another question).<br /><br />Simply paging through this book is to touch upon long-considered ideas.  I believe we tend to ignore the aphorisms and phrases we hear every day, no matter what cleverness or wisdom may lie behind them.  To browse through the aphorisms and phrases of a learned language is to put aside this disability and see old concepts in a new light.<br /><br />Nicely done!	2004-09-26

It's all well and good to bring a big bleeding heart and a comedic disdain to the task of dissecting the Middle East, but it's a difficult task when one dismisses the motivation of the Middle Easterns out of hand.<br /><br />Through poignant individual stories, Cramer paints the picture of an offensive, hijacked Israeli state playing a dangerous game for its own survival and racking up ever more enemies as it goes.<br /><br />Fair enough - the complexities of the Middle East make virtually any portrait realistic.  One person can say \\"the Palestinians are the scum of the earth!\\" and the next person can say \\"the Israelis are murderous thugs,\\" and both people can be right.  There's plenty of death on both sides, and no sign of a resolution in sight.  It's a bit much to expect Cramer to have a definitive answer to this quagmire (though he proposes one with his title and his \\"questions.\\"<br /><br />And yet he ought to entertain the possibility that the perpetual war in the Middle East is about more than property rights and petty imperialism.  As the nexus of the three great monotheistic religions, one would think that an analysis of Israel might pay more than passing notice to the interplay of these religions in the ongoing conflicts.  But Cramer can't.  Handicapped by his secular blindness, he charges along, missing the whole picture and presenting a petty (if wryly humorous) image that fits his own misconceptions.	2004-09-26

The Great Heresies is certainly not shy - simply recognizing Islam (Mohammedism), Protestantism, and \\"The Modern Attack\\" (Secular Humanism) as heresies is a surefire way to alienate a good portion of humanity.  Belloc seems to delight in his analysis, secure in his own faith and tradition.  As another reviewer noted, this is refreshing to the modern ear, so use to banality in the name of tolerance and diversity.<br /><br />In the scale of things, it is too early to judge Belloc's prophesies about the death of Protestantism and the rise of Islam.  Nevertheless, as the old-line Protestant churches are subsumed into the animist wing of secular humanism, and as the nominally Christian leaders of the West cast a blind eye to militant Islam, it is tempting to see Belloc affirmed.<br /><br />Of particular interest are Belloc's attacks on capitalism (if not the market economy) and his admonition that there is no such thing as \\"Christianity\\" in the sense of an ecumenical doctrine among Protestants and Catholics.  In the case of the former, Belloc admirably recognizes the incumbent dangers of wage-slavery, though he underestimates the capitalist system's self-preservation.  In his contrast of capitalism and communism, he seems to prefer some other system (socialism?) but never really suggests an orthodox economic theory.  I'm very curious as to what economic system Belloc would install, were he given his choice in the matter.  I must admit that I'm afraid Belloc would fall on the side of feudalism.<br /><br />As to the admonition about \\"Christianity\\" being a non-definition, such a view is both insightful and misleading.  Certainly non-Catholic (and non-Orthodox) Christians seem to be contained in a gradient from Catholicism to deism, but one might argue that recognition of Christ as the Word-made-Flesh is a fairly basic creed.  While such a simple creed permits numerous heresies to exist, it does suggest that the term Christian is more than a misnomer.  I wonder what Belloc would make of American Evangelicals, whose fervor and thirst for doctrine drive them to a meaningful dialog with Lutherans, Catholics, and those rare believing Episcopalians.<br /><br />In summary, Belloc's Heresies presents an interesting and well developed perspective on a 2000 year assault on the Church, with a treasure trove of insights and a welcome curmudgeonly attitude about the whole issue, which is, of course, the only issue.t, it does suggest that the term Christian is more than a misnomer.

Other reviewers have commented on Johnson's highly selective rogues' gallery, but, after all, he is citing examples of an archtype he has openly defined, so he can get away with it.<br /><br />While readable, amusing, and informative, we all know that left wing intellectuals are magotty pieces of human trash, and, of course, there's little to contradict this in Johnson's work.  The mind of the leftist intellectual is warped by their desire to reconstruct reality to excuse their own animal predelictions. Consequently their philosophical systems have spiraled continuously toward anarchism interspersed with protectionism for their own elite community.  I offer the platitude that \\"all intellectuals are in search of their own politburo.\\"<br /><br />While it would be nice to see how Johnson treats the \\"intellectuals\\" of the right, it is amusing to see some other reviewers claim bias in Johnson for excluding conservatives.  I ask you, when has a leftist ever admitted such a thing as a conservative intellectual?  The left thinks everyone to the right of Che Guevera is a slack-jawed mouth-breather.  Consequently, the left has purloined the very term \\"intellectual,\\" and like many a good term they have adopted (liberal, progressive, pacifist, etc), the left's use of \\"intellectual\\" has coated the word with their filth, unfit for use by anyone but themselves.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />One curious aspect of Johnson's series of essays was in his chapter on Hemingway, which began with a long detour into Emerson.  While Johnson paints it as \\"setting up his treatment of Hemingway,\\" it looks more like an abortive essay on Emerson that was too good to delete and was subsequently pasted onto the Hemingway analysis.  For that matter, it seems as if Johnson got rather tired of the whole project (not surprising given the material) and finished the book off with a mad sortie through the postmodernist types.  A little slapdash, but he covered a mess of ground in a hurry!<br /><br />Perhaps I am of the wrong generation, as I know of no-one who takes any of the figures in this book seriously.  Rather, they are viewed as pink-panther cartoon beatniks; amusing, dangerous, but ultimately just silly - for all their self-absorbed sophistry they are separated from Joe-Sixpack by nothing but an enhanced vocabulary.<br /><br />Johnson captures this perfectly, skewering the sacred cows of the intelligensia with fortitude and panache.

I have since been punished by receiving their relentless phone calls.<br />My copy  of &quot;A Life in Pictures&quot; arrived along with three PBS DVD's, and it was a while before I got around to flipping through its pages.<br />It wasn't until this week that I got around to reading it.  The last picture in the book was quite moving now that Reagan has exited the stage at last.<br />The photos are all worthwhile - though many of them can be found elsewhere.  The young Reagan transitioning to the old Reagan presents a remarkable image.<br />Still, it must be pointed out that anyone selecting Dan Rather to write an introduction to a book about Reagan must have their motive questioned, at the very least.  Having Rather opinine about Reagan is like having Rush Limbaugh write the introduction to a book about Bill Clinton.<br />Rather tries his hardest to say decent things about Reagan while condemning everything he stood for, and is marginally successful.  So are the editors, whose captions to the photos only occassionaly break forth in utter disdain.  Again - recognizing Reagan's iconographic standing, they are hesitant to resort to outright calumny.  Still, they don't miss a chance to characterize his followers as &quot;rabid,&quot; emphasize his emotional distance as a father, or give more than equal time to his detractors.<br />Finally, there's some typical Time/Life nonsense in the book, such as the &quot;Other Presidents Who Survived Assassination Attempts&quot; and &quot;Other Prominent First Ladies&quot; sections.<br />Still, one can always ignore the captions and text, and come away with a nice collection of images of the Gipper.	2004-06-08

The account he gives of Reagan's life and accomplishment is clouded by his personal astonishment and confusion.  Morris would do well to keep Ockham's Razor in mind (though I mean this more in reference to inventing excuses for Reagan's ideology and determination, and not in reference to the historical entities Morris creates in order to tell his story).<br />While &quot;Dutch&quot; is readable, informative, and mildly illuminating, it's ultimately a three-legged dog; it performs quite remarkably given its limitations.<br />With giants like Reagan and Manchester passing away, the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; fades a little more, and we are left with the petty and sallow men of our present generations - self congratulatory, self-enthralled, and totally unable to fathom what motivated Ronald Reagan.	2004-06-08

Kamen does an excellent job painting an unconventional portrait of Philip.  In the process, however, the &quot;Black Legend&quot; is reduced to a somewhat flighty renaissance princeling.<br />For whatever reason, I never received the anglophile's disdain for Philip.  Perhaps it was Warren Carroll's portrait of Philip in his Christendom series, or Hillaire Belloc's view, both of which tended to paint Philip as the tragically ineffectual hero of Catholic Europe, standing in the breach against both the heretic and the Turk, and only partially saving Europe while dooming his own Empire.<br />As ought to have been expected, Kamen's well researched and presented portrait shows a complex individual, capable of progressivism (ala opposition to blood purity laws and early support for Tridentine reforms), while simultaneously enjoying the public manifestations of the Inquisition.  The casual nature of Philip's early marriages contrasts starkly against his reaction to the death of his fourth wife.  &quot;Philip the Bureaucrat&quot; would seem to be an apt title for a King paralyzed by paperwork, and unable to govern his vast realms due to slow communication, shifty underlings, and a byzantine political system that only Umberto Eco could love.<br />It is hard, in the end, to get a bead on Philip.  It is indeed tragic for Spain that the many great chances for the establishment of their empire were lost in the various cataclysms of Dutch piracy, stormy seas, and overzealous generals - thus contributing to the later usurpation of Portugese westernization of the orient, English dominance of North America, and setting the stage for Cardianl Richelieu and far bloodier events in Europe.<br />Of course, Kamen avoids projecting out consequences, only hinting at the damage done to Spain by the misfortunes of Philip's reign.  For a biography of &quot;the world's most powerful man,&quot; the focus is so narrow as to be somewhat myopic.  But it is at this price that we obtain the detail which saves Philip from both the Black Legend and latter-day sanctification - neither of which he deserves.d's most powerful man,&quot; the focus is so narrow as to be somewhat myopic.

I have a tendency to judge all works on devotions, customs, and practices by whether the full tenebrae is included and explained - and this book comes pretty darn close!  There is an excellent breadth of information which is a fine supplement to the catechism, and other more targeted books such as Dubruiel's How-To Book of the Mass.  When contrasted against Dues' Catholic Customs &amp; Traditions, Flaherty's work is more down-to-earth, informative on present practice, and in-line with the magesterium (but not quite as developed compared to the excellent historical perspective that Dues provides).<br />That being said, the book lacks somewhat in readability.  While the author does a nice job making individual sections entertaining with anecdotes &amp; analogies, the structure of the book just doesn't lend itself to being a through-read.  Frankly, this may be my fault for trying to devour it linearly.<br />Overall, a nice addition to any Catholic's library, and certain to pique some ideas and get people out of ingrained modes of worship to try some time-honored practices.	2004-01-29

He is not wholly partisan, managing to achieve some slight pathos for Anne Boleyn &amp; Elizabeth.  To get this across to a partially educated Catholic reader is no mean feat, particularly when the last reformation history they read was Cobbett's polemic.<br />I did note that Belloc relies on Cobbett's History of the Protestant Reformation in England &amp; Ireland as a source.  And while this work is rousing, fairly convincing, and entertaining, it is too strong a piece of counter-propoganda to be relied upon.<br />Still, this has minor impact on Belloc's portrait.  His assertion that the Reformation hinged in England is well supported.  If anything, there is a subtle disdain for the Austrian/Spanish emporers (which I attribute to Belloc's Anglo-franco environment), particularly compared with the much more rigorous treatment by Warren Carroll.<br />This is an engaging read, and certainly provides an angle on the Reformation that is unlikely to be developed elsewhere.  The book cannot be read without prior knowledge of Reformation &amp; European history, or without a handy reference, as Belloc does not fully develop the historical context around his characters.  Rather, the focus is on the characters themselves, and in this, Belloc is admirably successful in his efforts to rewrite the legacies of these individuals.<br />Finally, I found most impressive Belloc's assertions that Pascal and Descartes (as products of the Reformation) were the unwitting forebears of secularism, rationalism, and materialism.  While Belloc's very brief argument needs further scrutiny, his division of Western Thought into Greek/Thomastic and post-Descartes is intriguing.	2003-12-12

It begins from a mere germ of an idea, inferred from an  unchallenged source, and then slowly balloons until it is a diatribe against eugenics, modern education, moral relativism, egoism, secularism, scientism, Nietzche, Darwin, and Jeremy Bentham.<br />It's a rather audacious trajectory, and would be ludicrous if it weren't so... accurate.  As the saying goes: \\"I'm not paranoid if they're really out to get me.\\"  Lewis makes some bold statements here, extrapolating from a relatively subtle implication in a textbook to a metaphysical humanist conspiracy.  But Lewis understands Natural Law, and understand the penalties of disobedience.  Consequently, the picture he paints of the evolutionary abolition of anything recognizably human in man is disturbing and all too believable.<br />Anyone familiar with today's college campus, or today's journalist, will realize the total victory of relativism (unless, of course, he is a relativist).  Conditional eugenics, so thoroughly disgraced by the Nazis and the New Deal, is replaced by Genetic eugenics, praised and lauded ala the human genome project.  Anyone who sits back and wonders what we'll do \\"once we crack the code,\\" ought to read The Abolition of Man for his answer... or \\"Dumbing Us Down\\" for confirmation.	2003-10-26

William Whalen is to be commended on his efforts to be matter-of-fact, and in most cases, succeeds at tempering bias.  The book is an engaging read, full of information, well balanced, and broad in scope.<br />There are a few instances where the text contains implied judgement.  Particular scorn is reserved for the Mormans (as would, of course, be fitting for such a religion that has the gall to call itself Christian).  Whalen cannot resist the occasional contrast against Roman Catholicism, and I got the impression that apologists for the various Faiths described would not have focussed quite so much on certain aspects.<br />Nevertheless, it must be recognized that this is a book written to assist Catholics in ecumenical and interfaith understanding, rather than a purportedly unbiased review of religions.  As such, it is perfectly acceptable to feel the loss of critical aspects of the Catholic Faith within those religions that derive from the Mother Church.<br />As a side note, since some Baptists claim their church &quot;pre-dates Christ,&quot; I suspect they would be quite offended by their place on the &quot;Christian Family Tree&quot; in Whalen's book.  I also suspect that when even the Pope recognizes Eastern Orthodoxy as &quot;the second lung&quot; of The Church, the placement of the Eastern Orthodox church on a branch would cause significant resentment.<br />Finally, most notably lacking in the book was treatment of the Traditionalist Catholics.  Their claim is that the second largest denomination in America is &quot;Catholics who left after Vatican II.&quot;  While SSPX might be relatively small in America, I would consider their presence at least as worthy of note as &quot;The Old Catholics.&quot;	2003-10-13

I really expected a rigorous, systematic defence of orthodox doctrine.  Instead, I read a rousing autobiography, which left me in continued awe of the author, but rather bemused about Chesterton's mental habits.<br />First off, Chesterton in relation to various heresies (in particular secularism), is a bit like a drunken man with a sledgehammer in a china shop.  Not an angry drunk, but a happy, wild-eyed, well-practiced drunk.  Chesterton's intellect so thoroughly overpowers the counterarguments that he sometimes seems at a loss as to which direction to swing the hammer.  So he muddles cheerfully along, smashing a bit of Nietzchism here, crushing a Socialist argument there.  And through it all he seems painfully aware of the oncoming post-modern society, in which the ultimate secular virtue of tolerance would leave us oblivious to rational argument.<br />Orthodoxy is replete with classic Chesterton.  He makes his points with precise metaphors that waste no words.  A particular favorite of mine is his argument against the relativist effort to remove value from physical or abstract objects.  Chesterton cites the title of a work called &quot;the Love of Triangles&quot; and points out that if Triangles are loved for anything, they are loved for being triangular.<br />As with The Everlasting Man, Chesterton provides his readers with a neat intellectual trick that can be used for self-analysis.  In Orthodoxy, the trick is the reduction of conversation to monosyllabic sentences.  Chesterton has found another key characteristic of the modern world here - the tendency of people to adopt a complex language for the express intent of not saying anything at all.  Anyone familiar with the sciences will understand the necessity of precision in language, combined with the maddening inability of the words themselves to convey the desired meaning.  As an example, I refer to isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic polymers.  These terms refer to the pattern of orientation in polymer chains.  Is it possible to infer that from the terminology?  Our language is full of adopted &quot;scientific&quot; nomenclature that contains meaning of which we are unaware.  One of these days, I'm going to state a hyperthesis and wait for someone to point out my spelling error.<br />But I digress.  Chesterton's recognition is that the more complex our language, and the more specialized its application, the less meaning the language itself conveys.  Witness the confusion over the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive,&quot; cited by Chesterton as examples.  Anyone familiar with the modern (American&quot; connotations of these words will recognize that &quot;liberal&quot; is someone who wants to limit free speech, have government control over the economy, mandate the membership of the Boy Scouts, and dictate how many gallons of water can be contained in your toilet tank.  Progressive is simply someone who wants to progress back to the 60's.  The meanings of the words are a far cry from the definition of the words.<br />Chesterton supplies the antidote - one syllable words only.  While this is obviously of limited utility, it's a nice exercise (like trying to cook breakfast using only your left hand, if you're right handed).  His point is well taken - the one-syllable words are pretty hard to confuse or confute, and they're remarkably handy.  They're also anathema to wordy people like me.<br />I cannot, of course, help compare Chesterton's autobiographical Orthodoxy with Augustine's Confessions.  I shudder to think that it is the different audiences that define the difference in these books, but in any case here is a contrast between a brilliant ancient writer and a brilliant modern writer, both explaining how they came to accept Christ and His Church.

Frankly, I was surprised to find myself enjoying Empire Falls, given that: A) it was written within the last 10 years, and B) it won the Pulitzer Prize.  Both of these features would normally mark the novel as an apathetic paean to \\"post-modern\\" America.<br />And there's certainly a heavy dose of mindless \\"Lord loves a workin' man\\" Nor'eastern rust-belt liberalism.  Russo's characters are, in hindsight, elaborate and complex caricatures drawn upon \\"tolerant & diverse\\" sensibilities.  The most notable examples are the Catholic priests.  There is the contrast: the young, vibrant, tolerant empathetic gay priest against the old, hateful orthodox priest whose senility reveals his true depraved character.  Such cartoons are what I would expect from Pulitzer prize winners, and mark a certain level of self-bigotry in Russo - a term that must be coined to describe Northeastern Catholics (that is, I presume Russo is Catholic - if he's not, then strike the \\"self\\" off of the above appellation).<br />Still, Russo brings a dashing style to his writing that lets him get away with the tolerant prejudices.  The plot is fairly engaging, and the aspect most greatly to Russo's credit is that he avoided the nihlism that seemed to permeate the action.  Unfortunately, the climax was just too simple.  I find myself agreeing with other reviewers that Russo seemed to have written himself into a corner.  Personally, I would have been more satisfied with the novel had nothing of consequence ever happened, despite my sympathies for Miles Roby & the town of Empire Falls.<br />I can't avoid a reference to the pun or double entendre of the title.  Such things, though trite, always amuse me (\\"Moving Pictures\\" by Rush being my favorite for its several implications).<br />Readers who have been exposed to Walker Percy will find much to consider in the contrast with Russo: Southern Catholic vs. Yankee Catholic, 60's nihlist vs. 90's relativist, Story as Metaphor vs. Metaphor as Story, etc., etc.  Whether it is just the \\"abandoned by wife\\" starting point or not, the comparison of Dr. Tom Moore of  \\"Love In the Ruins\\" and Miles Roby of \\"Empire Falls\\" is intriguing.<br />In summary, Empire Falls is a good book, well written, from a gifted author, but recycling a little too much NBC Evening News pandering for my tastes.ist vs. 90's relativist, Story as Metaphor vs. Metaphor as Story, etc., etc.  Whether it is just the \\"abandoned by wife\\" starting point or not, the comparison of Dr. Tom Moore of  \\"Love In the Ruins\\" and Miles Roby of \\"Empire Falls\\" is intriguing.<br />In summary, Empire Falls is a good book, well written, from a gifted author, but recycling a little too much NBC Evening News pandering for my tastes.	2003-09-26

I am awed by the theological, doctrinal, linguistic, and scriptural dexterity of Mr. Staples (and others affiliated with Envoy).  And perhaps this awe is what makes me doubt the utility of this work.<br />If apologetics is the frontline of ecumenical engagement, and the &quot;straw men&quot; that serve as examples in this book are indicative of real evangelical challenges, then count me out.  My memory is far too shoddy to recall chapter, verse, and number, let alone the variations in ancient Greek and how its gender-sensitive derivations impact our interpretation of Aramaic.  Even if I had this book on hand during an apologetics confrontation, I'd spend more time thumbing through it than actually arguing.<br />Still it's a great read, and provides a converted-Catholic perspective to us poorly catechized (and never scripturized) cradle-Catholics.<br />So, to Mr. Staples, et al... go get 'em!  As I see we're in good hands, I'll just go back to reading St. Augustine.  Let me know how the whole ecumenical outreach thing goes...	2003-09-11

I certainly respect the author and believe her thesis.  There are many positives to the work put into the book, as well as to the publication of the book itself.<br />However, I found the book to be a largely anecdotal effort.  While certainly meeting (modern) journalistic standards, I remain unconvinced that America is really seeing a significant trend of permanent orthodoxy among the Gen X'ers (among whom I am counted).<br />I want to believe Carroll, and much of her argument agrees with my own experience.  Still, it reminds me of a Neil Peart quote: &quot;My precious sense of rightness is sometimes so naive, that that which I imagine is that which I believe.&quot;<br />I didn't find the book to be a particularly engaging read.  The content seems repetitious and the same points are made in identical manners in several different places in the book.  We are reintroduced to the same sources in different contexts.  I certainly can't say that the book was not well written, but it seemed disjointed.<br />In any case, the author has much more experience with a diverse population than I do, and her argument is very encouraging.  Hope springs eternal, and I'll join her in praying that the tide has turned against secularism.	2003-09-11

Gruner or his &quot;apostolate,&quot; I really didn't know what to expect.  But from the first pages of the book, I sensed that there was something &quot;not quite right.&quot;<br />First of all, though a biography, the tone and content is entirely self-aggrandizing.  Where it is not smug and self-congratulatory, it is defensive and petty.  This is not an inspired work.  Or, more aptly, this is not a divinely inspired work.<br />Secondly, while Fr. Gruner appears to have suffered at the hands of left-leaning Ecclesiastic authorities, he has enjoyed considerable freedom.  Ultimately, he comes across as a man who will bow to no-one.  This is admirable in many respects.  It is just not admirable that he will not recognize the legitimate authority of the Church.<br />While I am sympathetic to the traditionalists, among whom Fr. Gruner is at home, and cannot fail to notice some of the sour fruits of Vatican II, I have much more respect for the schismatics in SSPX et al, who at least have the courage to bear their excommunication, than for those borderline Tridentines who court the good name of the Pope while undermining the authority of the Papacy and the Magesterium.<br />By all means, hearken unto Fatima.  Practice the devotions, say the rosary and the little office.  Admire Immaculate Mary and seek to emulate her perfect love of God.  But beware the inculcation of hatred, and its purveyors.<br />In summary, I can only echo the words of an excellent and faithful priest in regard to Fr. Gruner: &quot;it is a pity that such zeal is wasted.&quot;	2003-09-11

At times I was frustrated, and believed that the book was imbued with a generative power, and grew longer the further I read.<br />And yet I am a little sad to have finished it, for no matter what was going on in my life, like Scripture, the City of God had relevance.  How to summarize such a monumental work?<br />First of all, I do not concur with the dimishment of the early parts of the work.  While Books 1 through X are indeed more clearly tied to the dissolving Roman world, it is extremely helpful for us to get our minds into a time when pagans were more than countercultural \\"post-Christian\\" teenage losers.  Augustine's vivid arguments against the pagan \\"theology\\" are incisive.  More notably, they bring into focus a world that was both ultra-rational in the Platonic/Aristotilean tradition, and \\"superstitious\\" in its belief in household gods, demons, curses, and magic.  That both a very advanced science and such beliefs could coexist is a lesson to us in our secularized, smug modern world.<br />The temporal proximity of Augustine to Christ and the Apostles brings another level of clarity.  While Augustine emphasized that \\"none shall know the day nor hour,\\" it is clear that there is an apocolyptic undercurrent in the Christian society he inhabits.  The urgency of Christian life seems to me to have diminished.<br />Particularly striking are Augustine's arguments against those \\"tender-hearted Christians\\" who hold various levels of Salvation for even the most depraved.  In our world of ecumenical outreach, guitar-Mass hippy communalism, Augustine's defense of the limited Salvation is a necessary wake-up call.<br />Certainly there are moments of \\"how many angels on the head of a pin,\\" which I suppose Augustine inspired in latter theologians.  The various discussions of the form, age, and physical condition of post-Resurrected faithful seems unworthy of discussion.  And yet he was writing in direct argument against contemporaries.  This, at least, is fascinating; that anti-Christians of Augustine's day tried to build a rational case against particular aspects of Christian doctrine, rather than against the underlying thesis of Christ.<br />The more history you know, the more mythology you have read, and the better acquainted with Scripture you are, the more you will get out of The City of God.  But such things are not necessary.  Augustine is a patient writer (as exemplified by the vast scope of this and other works).  He walks his readers painstakingly through each subject.<br />I must agree with other reviewers that the last two Books are worthy to stand alone, treating of hell, purgatory, and heaven.  As vivid and daunting as the discussion of hell is, so is the beatific vision inspiring and easing.  Augustine above all knows the value of true peace - the peace of Christ.  And he knows too well the limits of the City of Man in attaining this peace.  That he has indeed \\"tasted and seen\\" is wonderfully clear, and he inspires and encourages his readers to share in that faith and hope which motivate his life.<br />There are so many details of note: from the Christ-prophetic visions of Greek sybils to the independent trinitarian philosophy of Plato.  Such details are commonplace to Augustine, but we have forgotten them.  Truly, The City of God must be reckoned among the necessities of catechismic formation, mostly for Roman Catholics, but if certain later prejudices can be ignored, for all Christians as well.  I would caution Jewish readers that Augustine makes no bones about the deicide and subsequent temporal punishment that he believes the Jews endure, until their conversion with the Last Judgement.  As to pagans and heretics of all stripes, you've met your match in Augustine... he outwitted you 1500 years ago.<br />Lest I be as prolix as Augustine himself, I will conclude by referencing the great spiritual help that this book provides.  Particularly in modern times, though American Christians (and even American Catholics) are notably free from persecution, the City of Man calls us ever more away from Truth.  Augustine's book helps us walk, not on the path of our own disordered priorities, but toward that greater and infinite blessedness we have been promised in Christ.ovides.

I remembered these books as light-hearted fantasies (Dawn Treader being my favorite).  I also remembered them being much longer.<br />I came away with a couple of impressions.  First, I'm anxious to start giving this collection to my nieces, nephews, and godchildren - but they're not old enough (drat!).  Second, the Christian Motif cannot be ignored on an adult reading;  I only vaguely remember Aslan being a sort of \\"Messiah-Lion\\" from an earlier reading.  On the positive side, Lewis accomplishes a great deal by forcing us to see Christian history outside of our familiar context.  Today's modern pantheists, atheists, and agnostics are so thoroughly steeped in Christianity that they don't recognize it at all.  Refer to Chesterton's \\"The Everlasting Man\\" for a more studious treatment of the technique that Lewis applies.<br />Unfortunately, the fantasy world that Lewis creates is not a perfect fit for the Christian allegory.  The pre-existence of the Empress of Charn, for example contrasts with the creation of Narnia somewhat unfavorably.  And at least in a macroscopic view, the universe Lewis creates lacks self-consistency, and diminishes the more contained world of Narnia.  However, I feel this is nitpicking.  The Chronicles of Narnia isn't meant to be dogma, but Christocentric childrens' books.<br />Finally, the Chronicles of Narnia offers an excellent contrast to the Harry Potter tripe.  The books are a worthwhile gift to any kid with a fascination with dragons, knights, magic and mythology, and ultimately serve to reinforce rather than degrade the Faith.	2003-08-13

Just an observation...<br />While Thoreau is a curious individual - sort of a poor-man's G.K. Chesterton - he always seems to come up short.  The Virtue of Civil Disobedience reads more like self-satire than a serious attempt at political philosophy.  And while Walden is rich and fulfilling, it is ultimately just a vehicle for Thoreau to make baseless claims predicated upon his treasury of tidbits and odd knowledge.<br />Had Thoreau been blessed with living in the modern world, he could have just written \\"Living by a Pond on Your Own For Dummies\\" and saved himself (and us) a lot of trouble.<br />Instead of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" I recommend anything by Lysander Spooner (particularly \\"No Treason\\")<br />Instead of \\"Walden\\" I recommend \\"Two Years Before the Mast.\\"  It's both more relevant than Walden, and a heck of a lot Closer To Nature.	2003-07-21

Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.<br />Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred.  Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.<br />Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?).  Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot;  These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.<br />As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;<br />Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments.  It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance.  Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules.  The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society.  Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot;  It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.<br />Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject.  His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.<br />As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value.  Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages.l cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society.

There are certainly many sources for the history of the Norman invasion, within context or without.  Howarth's account casts the oft-repeated events of 1066 into a vivid and impressive light.  His &quot;fairness&quot; obviously depends on your point of view, but he readiliy admits his prejudices.<br />Any effort to inject life into historical events is bound to be objectively flawed.  There is much that we simply cannot know, yet without that knowledge, the events lose their impact and become a tangled mass of cause &amp; effect (unless, of course, you are of the existentialist school, in which case they are meaningless anyway).<br />Howarth defends his sources and interpretation, and does so credibly.  And within this selected framework, succeeds in a portrait of Harold, William, England, and the Continent that has all the resonance of current events.  I would venture to say that Howarth depicts 1066 as something other than a fait accompli, which is no mean feat for such an famous date.	2003-07-11

The work itself is intricate and should satisfy all but the most rabid Tolkien fans.  But on another level, it is also fascinating that  a \\"fake history\\" that is, in many ways, as difficult to read as an 16th century humanist saga, should be so attractive.  After all, there are \\"real\\" mythologies abounding, and despite our familiarity with the main characters (Zeus, Ulysses, Odin, Thor, etc), there is as much to be learned in the background as Tolkien presents in the collected Silmarillion.<br />Perhaps the attractiveness is that Tolkien presents us with a completed cycle from the birth of the world, through to (presumably) the world as we know it.  The departure of the Elves at the end of the Third Age, the diminishing of the Dwarves, Hobbits, and Dark Elves provide a bridge between the creatures of our own mythology and the world Tolkien created.<br />It is also interesting that Tolkien so thoroughly avoided theology.  His \\"fallen angel\\" is familiar enough.  Anyone who has read Augustine's City of God will be immediately familiar with the perspective in which Tolkien holds the gods of his story as opposed to the dark powers.  It is the strange dichotomy of Man & Elf / Mortality and Immortality, and the \\"purposes\\" for each implied in the creation of the World that is left tantalizingly unexplored.  Thus the \\"advantage\\" of Tolkien's \\"fake history\\" is not pursued, leaving one to unsatisfying conjecture.<br />As a minor complaint, the fractured nature of parts of the book are apparent and disappointing, if understandable.  The writing style, vast material covered, and lack of depth in the characters will disappoint many LOTR fans.  But the gems buried within (the origin of Gandalf, for example) are well worth whatever discomfort the work might cause.  And ultimately, after reading the Silmarillion, the leap to \\"real mythologies\\" becomes a lot easier.	2003-07-11

Cahill's introduction takes up the theme of &quot;the ever sufferin' Irish&quot; and the rest of his work goes on to illustrate an important role that the Irish, and in particular, Irish Monastics played in a sort of &quot;Classical Evangilization&quot; of Europe.<br />Cahill's point is well taken.  The reality of the preservation of ancient text and knowledge within the confines of monastic libraries is indisputable.  Of course, there was a similar preservation of greco-roman knowledge among the Muslims, but the Irish redistribution of such learning is markedly different from the humanist extractions of the renaissance.<br />It comes as no surprise that this book is denigrated as being &quot;illegitimate history.&quot;  Secular historians (an overwhelming majority) are entirely too dismissive of their own biases.  They prefer to construct dinosaurs from toe-nails and read volumes into single letters - anything to prove their &quot;Post-Christian&quot; street-cred.<br />As such, they no doubt see any posthumous biography of St. Patrick as propoganda, and see Cahill's dependence on such sources as flawed - preferring to deconstruct Patrick into multiple people, change him into a woman, or ascribe to him all of the perceived ills of superstition and opression.<br />Whether or not Cahill tells &quot;the whole story,&quot; he certainly tells a side of it that you will not get from your palsied post-modernist, anglophile deconstructionist history professor.<br />And that's a good thing.	2003-07-11

I literally couldn't put it down until it was finished.  And once it was done, I was craving more.  This is a good book!  The characters are fairly well developed, but strange to the extreme.<br />Of greatest impact is the mood that Kirk creates.  This novel is fully textured and deep - in some ways it is reminiscent of Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; but without the exaggerated complexities.  The plot seems straightforward enough at the beginning, but it gets more and more abstract as it progresses, and the climax of the work is excellent.<br />I have yet to plumb the depths of this novel - it will take a couple more readings to satisfy myself that I haven't missed the subtext.  But any level, this is an excellent work (if you can find it!)	2003-06-26

Most fit Stephen Donaldson's description of a novel as \\"throwing words at a short story.\\"<br />The Everlasting Man demands to be annotated.  Chesterton's prose is masterful, his wit and sarcasm are triumphant, but most fundamentally, his arguments are pointed and illuminating.<br />Chesterton provides a method and a practical goal.  His method is to examine preconceptions by going out of context; to picture our reality as if we were strangers.  The goal is to compare the secularist, religious, and dogmatic views of man with this external picture.<br />His conclusion is in the recognition of Christ as The Distinguishing Event which bears no contrast or comparison with history before or since.  Along the way, he dices up comparitive religion, takes a poke or two at Spencer & Darwin, relegates Islam to a heresy (albeit a \\"respectable heresy\\") and thoroughly demolishes the concept of secularist rationality.<br />Among the more profound of Chesterton's recognitions is in the strange continuity of the Church.  A little apologetics is involved, but I get the impression that his discussions are intended more for comfort to the faithful than butressing his already-established arguments.<br />Overall, a thoroughly engaging read.  My only negative criticism of the book is the dexterity of Chesterton's references and citations.  I probably missed more of his allusions than I caught.  In some ways, it reminds me of Swift's Gulliver's Travels - we all get the \\"Big end/Little end\\" allusion to Protestant/Catholicism conflict, and the ancillary references to France/England, etc.  But only by reading thorough criticism do we find that Swift was referring not only to massive social events, but also to specific individuals and practices.  Without a key from contemporary society, there is no way for us to \\"get\\" Gulliver's Travels.  And I fear that this is true of \\"The Everlasting Man\\" as well.  Which only goes to prove some of the points of the book itself.<br />I wonder if Chesterton planned it that way?<br />Finally, I cannot help but cite the end of Part I as an example of the brilliance of the writing and the theme.  Referring to the first Christians in Rome, and the Roman persecution, Chesterton writes:  \\"And there shone on them in that dark hour a light that has never been darkened,; a white fire clinging to that group like an unearthly phosporescence, blazing its track through the twilights of history and confounding every effort to confound it with the mists of mythology and theory; that shaft of light or lightning by which the world itself has struck and isolated and crowned it; by which its own enemies have made it more illustrious and its own critics have made it more inexplicable: the halo of hatred around the Church of God.\\"<br />Grand!points of the book itself.<br />I wonder if Chesterton planned it that way?<br />Finally, I cannot help but cite the end of Part I as an example of the brilliance of the writing and the theme.

Nevertheless, his fairly unique interpretation of Scripture makes the book stand out.<br />The book is worth the read for Chapter 11 alone.  While I can't say I was wholly convinced that Lavoie's analysis was reasonable, the mental exercise of inserting the Shroud into John's Gospel is stimulating.<br />There are plenty of arguments for the authenticity of the Shroud, and Lavoie touches on many of them.  The medical/forensic approach is worthwhile and competent.  I would say that the &quot;Carbon Dating&quot; section has been overtaken by more recent research (also supporting authenticity).<br />The book is engaging, and written in a revelatory style that seems particularly appropriate to the long and complex story of the Shroud.	2003-05-24

And yet there is simultaneous value for the more detached reader.<br />Perhaps the clearest indication of the tone and style of the book is in the Introduction's quote from the biography of St. Gertrude the Great: &quot;If you desire to have some relics which will draw My Heart into yours, read My Passion, and meditate attentively on every word contained therein and it will be to you a true relic which will merit more graces for you than any other... thence you may know and be assured that the words which I uttered when on earth are the most precious relics which you can possess.&quot;<br />It is clear throughout that Joan Carroll Cruz has taken this message to heart - approaching the Relics she describes with reverence, but with proper perspective.	2003-05-24

Copperfield's ostensible auto-biography paints his character in simultaneous humanity and nobility that is difficult to achieve without creating a cartoon.  Dicken's achieves this subtlely over the full course of the text - nowhere does the story become superfluous except in the final pages.  What is remarkable is that this portrait of Copperfield exists in the same volume as the equally well-developed J. Steerforth.<br />The contrast of Steerforth (noble to the expense of his humanity, but failing because of human faults) with Copperfield (human to the expense of his nobility, and succeeding because of human virtues) is excellent and certainly carries much of the tension in the story.<br />This book thrives on character, much like my second-favorite Dickens' work: Bleak House.  As an aside, the comparison of both Mr. Richard (name changed to avoid titters) and Micawber in this volume with Harold Skimpole in Bleak House is most engaging.  The impact of these ancillary figures is excellent, and continuing revelation of Dickens pragmatism concerning money, ambition, and greed.<br />Indeed, David Copperfield is so inundated with pecuniary issues that it becomes almost unnoticable - finally creating the impression that money is the air we breathe, and that lack of it is something like asthma, while abundance of it is something like hyperventilation.<br />While the sentimentality may be regrettable to some, it comes with the territory with Dickens.  Folks who don't see sentimentality in bleak and stark portraits of brutal workhouse life simply do not recognize that the psychological impact of such descriptions is every bit as exaggerated as the more saccharine emotional scenes.<br />Finally, I echo other reviewers in wincing a bit at the character of Dora, but I feel like this is possible only because of her fate.  Had Dickens permitted his plot to retain a evolving relationship between Dora and Copperfield, the portrait would have been far more disturbing and far more acceptable to our sophisticated psychoanalysis.<br />Overall, a superb work that fulfills a primary purpose of entertainment, without overarching political or social commentary.  Copperfield stands at the forefront of a host of well developed and unique characters, acting within an engaging plot.to retain a evolving relationship between Dora and Copperfield, the portrait would have been far more disturbing and far more acceptable to our sophisticated psychoanalysis.<br />Overall, a superb work that fulfills a primary purpose of entertainment, without overarching political or social commentary.

But there is a large arena in which the explanation of cultural and temporal impact is relevant and instructive (the evolution of &quot;Santa Clause&quot; as one example).<br />Overall, I quite enjoyed the structure of the book.  The various topics were pretty well detailed. The full richness of Catholic tradition can hardly be encompassed in 200 pages, but there is clearly a lot of ground that wasn't covered (I searched and searched for an explanation of the tenebrae, for example, but found it absent).<br />In summary, I tend to agree that other than some historical reference, the sections concerning Sacraments are best ignored in favor of a doctrinally authoritative text.  But in calling to mind many things forgotten, or hinting at many things unlearned, this book serves a worthwhile and educational purpose.	2003-04-27

In fact, I was tempted to buy this book for the entire RCIA class this year (pecuniary interests prevented this, of course).<br />What may not be so obvious is the value to cradle Catholics.  So many details of the Mass are lost in the fog of CCD &amp; &quot;Religion Class&quot; (in my day, calling it &quot;Catechism Class&quot; would have offended the hippies and ex-nuns).  Details on the meaning and purpose of bowing vs. genuflecting, signs of the Cross, etc., were invaluable, as was the emphasis on the liturgical calendar and historical origins of different components of the Mass.<br />The author does a great job of focusing on the Real Meaning, as opposed to simply detailing the mechanics.  The Scriptural storyline provided is relevant and helpful, as are the personal anecdotes.  Also helpful was the admonition to the overscrupulous.  It was particularly appropriate for me to be armed with humility when I began to notice fellow parishioners genuflecting to the empty tabernacle on Good Friday.<br />The only thing missing from this book is an appendix of prayers during Mass (before &amp; after are provided).  While referencing the text of the Gloria, the Confiteor, etc., the full text was not provided.  Obviously these can be obtained elsewhere, but it would have been nice to have them for reference in this book.<br />In summary, Dubruiel's work ought to provide an entertaining and instructive read for any Catholic - cradle, convert, or returning, as well as providing a full explanation for non-Catholics wondering what the &quot;smells &amp; bells&quot; are all about.	2003-04-27

But much of the work is simply not feasible for the average project or department manager.  I do understand the inefficiencies that come from poorly executed innovation, prototyping, etc., but as far as functional guidelines go, a basic Product Design textbook has more useful and more flexible process descriptions.<br />Nevertheless, the book is at least entertaining, and is probably another route to making loads of dough for the IDEO guys, which, after all, is what IDEO seems to do best!	2003-04-22

One cannot separate this work from the 60's. The whole metaphor upon which the book is based is fairly trite. Of course, if you like \\"Earth in the Balance,\\" \\"The Population Bomb,\\" or \\"The Sirens of Titan,\\" then you'll probably absorb \\"Giles Goat Boy\\" into your own worldview and then go off on a pacifist riot through San Francisco.<br />Perhaps it is somewhat disappointing to see Barth lay aside his precious nihlism in favor of sweaty luddite pot-philosophy. It is certainly nice to see Barth avoid this tendency in his later works.<br />Compared to the disappointing \\"Letters: A Kind of Novel,\\" which is artistic to the point of unreadability, or \\"Chimera,\\" which is lacking in anything but the curiosity of being a Playboy pick, \\"Giles Goat Boy\\" is irresistably entertaining. The intricacy of the plot is vintage Barth (and of course, the whole \\"heroic cycle\\" thing is present, if you choose to reflect upon it). At moments (as in The Sot Weed Factor), Barth reveals glimpses of the perversions that he is to reveal more fully in later works (Somebody the Sailor, for example), but they are not as central to the story as they might have been.<br />All told, I would agree with other reviewers and suggest that those new to Barth steer clear of Giles Goat Boy until they have digested some of his other works. It is a fairly useful thing to understand Barth's structural tendencies when reading GGB, and an introductory reading of this book first is too likely to convince the reader that Barth is just another 60's type who writes a good piece of filth.ory reading of this book first is too likely to convince the reader that Barth is just another 60's type who writes a good piece of filth.	2003-03-25

I assume his reputation as a semiologist is well earned (since I know little about the subject beyond what Walker Percy digested).<br />Unfortunately, I found &quot;Travels in Hyperreality&quot; to be a hastily pasted collection of observations and commentary that is not really worthy of Eco's growing portfolio.  The book was sometimes interesting, but dry and tasteless.  I thought the whole lot of it could be encapsulated in Eco's strange observations concerning &quot;the wearing of blue jeans.&quot;  That is, if you're really, really, really into Eco and want to soak up everything he says, then this book will not disappoint.  If, on the other hand, you have limited time on your hands, then Eco's fictional works, or &quot;Search for the Perfect Language,&quot; are far better temporal investments.<br />Perhaps I didn't get it, or perhaps it was a mistake reading much of it in a bar in Santa Clara, but I would assert that this is only a book for the Eco purist.	2003-03-17

Rather, it is an argumentative text that strikes me in the same manner as the publications of the Marian Movement of Priests.<br />I skipped a good deal of this book due to general frustration with the rambling approach and the extension of scope beyond Fatima and into generalized Marian apparitions.<br />That this book lacks Nihil obstat and Imprimatur is telling, although the author notes the Vatican ruling that these are not required.  The author's assertion of unconditional submission is heartening, however.  Yet the Foreword is vey defensive in tone, and this defensiveness seems to permeate the work to follow.  Perhaps Dr. Petrisko has suffered supression and criticism to justify this generalized tone, but it comes across as something of a persecution complex.<br />Overall, I would recommend a more sober review of Fatima, and a separate review of Medjugorje and Marian apparitions before approaching this work.	2003-03-13

Books	3	14	27	N	N	Disappointing	While Sayers is clearly a gifted writer and thinker, this book comes across as something less than it could have been.  I found it to be more of a curiosity than a theological or doctrinal heavyweight.<br />First off, the entire work is fairly well encapsulated in its time.  While Sayers was certainly prescient with regard to the new age mysticism that permeates the West, one cannot help but receive &quot;Creed or Chaos&quot; in its temporal setting; stiff &amp; palsied nobility embracing meaningless nothingness vs. staunch but outnumbered traditionalists warning of the perils of neopaganism.<br />Secondly, there are unfortunate diversions into the doctrine of War and Economics that flaw the work.  Sayers begins well enough with exegesis, and transitions into some interesting apologetics, but as she deeper into her discourse she seems to lose her way, making a disconcerting leap from Augustine to Britain-At-War that is thoroughly unconvincing.  Her revulsion for the industrialized state leads to various equations of capitalism with the deadly sins, which is common enough for social-justice types.  This cursory economics is, however, dragged stillborn into her simplistic analysis of War, particularly with regard to the temporal context of the book: &quot;...the root causes of conflict are usually to be found in some wrong way of life in which all parties have acquiesed, and for which everybody must, to some extent, bear the blame.&quot;  Sadly, Sayers gets ever more unreasonable as she launches into a strange diatribe to justify this statement.<br />Doctrinally, Sayers stays pretty well in bounds, but utlizes a social justice perspective that falls somewhere between Teddy Kennedy and Phil Donahue. Nevertheless, she is adept in her denunciations of relativism and her defense of absolutism in the realm of Christian reality.<br />Overall, the work is an intriguing, and entertaining ramble.  Sayer's vehemence in defense of her positions is commendable, and the book is checkered with unique insights that still resonate more than half a century after its publication.  But in the final analysis the book serves neither as apologetics nor as theology, but only as &quot;Dorothy Sayers.&quot;eckered with unique insights that still resonate more than half a century after its publication.

So much in waterfowling is dependent on tradition, community, and access, so there are natural barriers to entry for the novice.<br />This book does an excellent job providing basic coverage of key duck hunting issues, but it is (of course) not a substitute for a good mentor or listening to some old timers yack about their previous seasons.<br />Of particular worth are the decoy spreads and the overview of different hunting venues.  But perhaps the greatest contribution is the insight on duck-hunting lingo.  I was unaware that I was a puddle jumper without a milk run, who had dabbled at pass shooting, but now I know.<br />Seriously, for those of us stuck in a rut hunting farm ponds, the introductions to river, lake, and flooded timber are intriguing and motivating.

In  \\"The Land\\" and Thomas Covenant, Donaldson has created a poetic, philosophical, and literary statement that transcends the particularity of its settings.  If the Thomas Covenant Trilogy is fantasy, then so are Voltaire's Candide and Swift's Gulliver's Travels.<br />A great deal of attention is paid to three aspects of this trilogy.  First: its comparisons with Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.  Second, Thomas Covenant as anti-hero, and third, the darkness or mood of the work.<br />With regard to comparison with Tolkein, it is certainly understandable, since both works deal with fantastic subjects and both are thoroughly original.  Tolkein repackages mythology into his own definition of elves, dwarves, goblins and the like - creating a \\"standard interpretation\\" of these mythologies that stands apart from the cultural context of the modern interpretations (witness the nobility of his Elves as opposed to the lighthearted Smurf-creatures of the American interpretation).  Donaldson, on the other hand, peoples his work with uniquely defined creatures, from the Giants to the Ur-Viles, that have no contemporary counterparts in popular mythology, at least in nomenclature.  Tolkein, of course, has been imitated, having used common mythology as a basis.  Donaldson's world is too unique to be thus reduced, and so he gets no genre of his own.<br />In a similar sense, both authors constructed complex and detailed worlds whose full history extends beyond the bounds of their primary works.  For Tolkein, it took the prequel (poshumous) Silmarillion to flesh out his world.  For Donaldson, it takes the slightly diminishing Second Trilogy.<br />There are significant differences, of course.  Tolkein despised metaphor.  You could argue that Donaldson is all metaphor.  But I digress.<br />The second set of commentary on Donaldson is related to Thomas Covenant as anti-hero.  It is a nice \\"gimmick\\" if you choose to look at it that way, and certainly results in some repulsion.  However, it is fundamentally intrinsic to the themes of the trilogy.  Covenant cannot be the messianic figure that is required of him in the \\"fantasy\\" sequences, without complete invalidation of the tensions between despair and hope which drive the novels.  With Covenant in any other mold, the works become nothing more than a very detailed and original fantasy work - just what they are often perceived to be.<br />Finally, the darkness or mood of the work is inevitable as well.  It is tempting to see the \\"Beggar's note\\" as a definition of the themes of the trilogy, and this may be what Donaldson intended.  I believe that the most striking theme contained in the trilogy is that aforementioned tension between despair and hope.  It is not a question of ethics, right and wrong, but a very question of existence that Covenant grapples with.  The leprosy issue (which would of course darken the trilogy) places Covenant in an artificial environment of isolation and unreality.  Even prior to the fantasy sequences, he is living in something of a second tier of existence.  The fantasy sequences exacerbate his isolation, but do not create it.<br />What surprises me most is the lack of commentary  or interest in the poetry, philosophy, and literary merits of the work.<br />Despite their bleak aspect, Donaldson's poetic asides bring depth to the work.  Lines such as \\"these are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives\\" are surprising in any modern novel.  \\"Golden Boy\\" is another such treasure.  Throughout the novels, Donaldson inserts beautiful phrases, poems, and lyrics that can be successful because he has deconstructed a critical context and justified the language by the very fantastic environment he is portraying.<br />In terms of the philosophy, Donaldson's treatment of paradox is particularly interesting.  Some existentialists have argued that Descartes fails to prove existence because it is impossible for man to leave his own sensory context (if you can find it, \\"what is it like to be a bat\\" is a very interesting example of this).  In brief, because we cannot imaging sensory input any different than what we already receive, we cannot use that sensory input to justify its reality.  The fantasy sequences in the Covenant trilogy are examples of the imagined twisting of senses that provide the protagonist with this very \\"impossible\\" sensory input - colors with timbre, sounds with hue, etc.  For Covenant to function in such an environment, particularly one so thoroughly in conflict with his own self-definition as a leper, is to create an unsustainable pressure that drives his catharsis.<br />Finally, the literary merits of the work seem obvious to me.  It is rare to find an author with such dexterity in the english language.  Donaldson's vocabulary is immense, and his use of it is natural.  His diction becomes as inherent to the trilogy as any other aspect.  His use of the anti-hero in something other than a 1960's nihlist novel is commendable, and the very structure of the trilogy is methodical and contributes substantially to the themes.  The subjects are mutli-layered, and aside from the three or four tiers of reality portrayed in the trilogy, there is additional depth in each character that reveals a keen psychological grasp.  Donaldson may additionally be advantaged by his real-world exposure to medicine and leprosy in particular, but his use and description of its characteristics and effects accomplishes exactly the tone that is required for the success of his ultimate conclusions.<br />And ultimately, Donaldson makes a point.  I won't reveal the key \\"revelation\\" of the work, particularly since it is more fully explored in the Second Trilogy, but I will hint that Lord Morham lets it slip (and you've just gotta love it when Morham starts kicking butt... but I'll let you enjoy that yourself).<br />In summary, Donaldson addresses existence, illusion, morality, paradox, hope, despair, self-realization, crime, expiation, rape, incest, war, and the meaning of life.  For me, he has much more in common with Faulkner than with Tolkien.  Don't let the genre fool you.  This is a profound set of novels.  If you can get past the mood, and the dark subject matter, you will find plenty of sustaining action, a world with incredible depth and beauty, and ultimately a validation of the very things that the mood of the books seem to threaten.Some existentialists have argued that Descartes fails to prove existence because it is impossible for man to leave his own sensory context (if you can find it, \\"what is it like to be a bat\\" is a very interesting example of this).

I still wonder what possessed him to pick this work or this author.<br />First, I must confess that this is the only De Mello work I am familiar with.  As it is the only work of his I am likely to read, this puts me at something of a disadvantage as a judge of this particular volume.<br />In general, however, Awareness comes across as something of a naked emperor.  Throughout, De Mello paints a picture that you &quot;can't get&quot; until you are &quot;awake.&quot;  Thus far, it sounds a lot like any form of faith or mysticism.  Where De Mello diverges is that he defines this vision as a unique entity.  It is impossible to call his vision Christian, let alone Catholic; throughout Awareness De Mello has much more use for the Buddhist transcendentalism than for Christian approaches to God.<br />As a form of spirituality, &quot;Awareness&quot; is watered-down yogiism, with a dose of EST &amp; a little bit of Simon &amp; Garfunkel thrown in.  This book will probably continue to be a hit with those spiritual seekers who are intent on new-age Godless spiritualism.  However, such a search will always be fruitless.  There is only one Way, and He is apparently of little use to De Mello.<br />I must, however, cite one benefit of his book.  After completing its nonsensical ravings, it occurred to me that it was right up the alley of a leftist/buddhist friend of mine.  I mailed him a copy, for which he thanked me... then I didn't hear from him for a couple of years.  Coincidence?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps De Mello's book can bring great benefits after all.	2003-03-02

I wasn't particularly looking for it, but I found it nonetheless.  For a former Ayn Rand afficianado & neo-Objectivist, the very title ought to have been anathema.  However, it was a greater sense of peace that I was after, and to some extent, this book is helpful at understanding one's true relation to God, particularly in terms of recognizing and submitting to His will.<br />I had previously attempted Kempis' \\"The Imitation Of Christ\\", and found that it was difficult to disassociate from the intended audience of that book (cloistered religious).  I'll try to review it in the near future.  In any case, my experience with Thomas a Kempis made me a little gun-shy with regard to spiritual primers intended for religious communities.  One of the challenges of \\"Self-abandonment\\" is the extent of its direct communication between the author (as spiritual director) and the nuns with whom he communicates.  Nevertheless, the more generalized introductory sections overcome this difficulty.<br />I happened to be in the midst of \\"Self-abandonment\\" at the time of my grandmother's death.  I must say that in retrospect I could not have found a better companion for those days.  de Caussade does an excellent job at communicating the spiritual benefits of acceptance, duty, and forgiveness.  It ought to be the goal of every Christian to make each day, and each moment of each day a paean to the Lord - seeing His will in all things - even small things and most particularly in painful things is a crucial step toward living a truly Christian life.<br />Finally, I don't know whether to call this book \\"life changing,\\" as I believe that one must already be at a certain level of acceptance prior to realizing benefits from the approach that de Caussade recommends.  Nonetheless, it is a useful and helpful aid to the continuing trauma of living in the world but not of the world.	2003-03-02

Most particulary striking is the insistence by the authors of \\"Restoring the Older Notion of Reason.\\"  The entire volume reads more like a Philosophy 101 text than a self-help guide for would-be evangelistas, and certainly leads me to hope that it's being used as a textbook in at least some of the nation's Christian colleges & universities (my alma mater is probably burning it as \\"anti-ecumenical and counter to post-Christian Christianity\\", if they have had time to look up from their Call-to-action newsletter).<br />The consistently syllogistic approach that the authors take is the great benefit of the work.  I am not aware of any instance in which they stooped to polemic or let eloquence and passion overcome the larger effort.<br />Of particular worth, outside the scope of apologetics but invaluable nonetheless, is the chapter on Objective Truth (15).  The authors do a great service by summarizing the fundamental differences between Eastern & Western thought with regard to objectivity and subjectivity.  The resultant conclusions (not always drawn) are very instructive when one seeks to understand the moral relativism and cultural relativist dynamics at play in the United States.<br />In any case, this is an invaluable reference to jumpstart an understanding of typical apologetic arguments, and makes a darn good read from page one, if you prefer to do it that way.	2003-03-02

I've never read a travelogue before, and doubt I will again.  Nevertheless, I had to buy Neil Peart's book, since it was Neil Peart, after all.<br />What makes this a good read is not the &quot;story&quot; itself; the events are mundane despite being transplanted to Africa.  The characters involved are interesting, but not fascinating.  Rather, it is Peart's style and his unique perspective that bring the same value to this work that his lyrics bring to Rush's music.<br />I attest that you could take Neil Peart and sit him down in a Barber shop for six hours, tell him to write it up, and you would have a fascinating new book to sell.<br />There are a couple of standout moments, however.  I agree with other reviewers that his description of meeting his wife in Paris is moving, and he conveys the emotional weight of the moment (even a priori if you don't know much about his recent tragedies).  The whole scene reminds me of John Barth's TKTTTITT (which I won't spoil for you - go read The Tidewater Tales!).  The genius in Peart is that he conveys, with a fairly minor story of taking a bike ride in Africa, the deep-seated impact of experience-as-reward, the point-of-the-journey-is-the-journey, and simultaneously validates Victor Hugo's statement &quot;the answer of he who knows everything is the same as the answer of he who knows nothing: because.&quot;<br />The second moment of impact that I will cite is his near-transcendance at the African convent.  It saddens me to no end to reflect on this moment and on Peart's ultimate rejection.<br />Overall, a satisfying book from an eloquent and prolific mind.  A book with much more depth than you might at first realize.	2003-03-02

Among the \\"objective historians\\", the lack of bias is paramount, and is established by attacking, diminishing, and demeaning whatever subject they approach.  Carroll, by way of contrast, admits a pre-existing bias, and is thus free to explore, explain, and defend his subject matter.<br />The Founding of Christendom accomplishes three great ends.  First, it provides a succinct and riveting chronological study of the \\"History of the World.\\"  I admit I was quite shocked to discover that Carroll picks up his work not from AD0, but from the moment of Creation itself.  Audacious!  And yet his historical approach provides a new view of Genesis.<br />Secondly, Carroll's portrait of the evolution of Judaism, through the birth of Christ gives a compelling view of the necessity of the Old Testament as a precondition to the New.<br />Finally, the extent to which \\"Foundation\\" establishes chronological context is particularly impressive.  Without so much as a \\"Meanwhile, in Greece...\\" Carroll manages to firmly establish the temporal relationship of Biblical events within the broader context of world history.  It is one thing to look at a wall chart displaying events in different civilizations at different times, and quite another to understand the relationship between Philistine domination of the Israelites and the Homeric legends of ancient Greece.  Certainly other works have hinted at the similarities between the Phillistines, Goliath and the Grecian demi-gods, but Carroll's was the first work that made it click so clearly.<br />Finally, this is the best of the four comparably excellent volumes for one primary reason: this volume has the least number of references to \\"August, the ancient dying time of Rome,\\" the phrase of resort that may be Carroll's one true weakness.	2003-03-02

In addition, Dulbruck does not address (at least, in his initial volumes) how war ought to be waged (ala Clausewitz).  Rather, the focus of his work in on the evolution of the art of war employed at key historic events.<br />These volumes are at their most engaging in the study of ancient warfare.  The analysis of the evolution of tactics in response to weapons, fighting styles, population, and geography is fascinating.<br />I have two major gripes with these books (and yes, I realize the author is long dead and unable to satisfy my deficiencies): First is the serious need of editing and revision.  So much information is crammed into the footnotes, addenda, and revised responses that it makes the read of each chapter something like transcendant deja-vu.  It makes for a multi-tiered reading experience that is quite unique, and disconcerting.  Secondly, a few diagrams, maps, or plots would have been extremely helpful.  I'm afraid that I'm a product of an educational system that limits my ability to conceptually distinguish between knolls, hillocks, rises, and a plain-old hill.<br />As to Delbruck's penchant for demythologizing ancient battles, I can only say that he is fairly convincing, most notably with regard to Marathon.	2003-03-02

A Must Read	For anyone unfamiliar with either Winston Churchill or William Manchester, this book provides a nice introduction to both.  Remember the name Manchester, and when you're done with this book, go immediately back to Amazon.com and buy \\"The Last Lion\\", both volumes (the third volume is not yet published, alas).<br />There are many astonishing events in Churchill's life, and one wonders at the extent of self-aggrandizement  in this book (certainly you wouldn't expect a politician to be entirely honest!).  Nevertheless, if only 1/4 of Churchill's stories were true, it would be more than enough to establish him among the icons of history.<br />That this work ends on Churchill's (first) rise to public prominence is fitting.  It is as if to say that prior to his political ascendency, Churchill's life was his own, and thus worthy of his own gifted commentary.  Whereas after he became a public figure, there was really nothing more for him to personally relate (of course, Manchester's anecdotal stories concerning Churchill's bathtime hijinks put the lie to that theory - refer to the Last Lion VII).  Not that there isn't plenty of autobiography in Churchill's other works (his history of World War II is rife with personal detail), but the tone is different, and the degree of revelation more subdued.<br />It is of incalculable benefit that we have access to such a personalized view of the childhood and formation of such a great man.  Not that he could be duplicated by applying such remedies to your own children (just add syphalitic father, sexually uninhibited but devoted mother, and healthy dose of latin lessons at exclusive English school).<br />I must confess that among the many details contained in this book, the one that I find most revealing is Churchill's daring and disastrous gambit during a childhood game of tag (a presage to Forcing the Dardanelles?).  This single incident speaks clearly to Churchill's indominatable spirit, incredible daring, and dangerous creativity.	2003-03-02

Certainly it is not prohibitively lengthy.<br />I have since passed the book along to a friend, and hope that he has since done the same.  Enough time has passed since reading it that I no longer have the urge to follow Call-to-Action types around and pin green-scapulars to their backs when they're not looking.  But I remain troubled by the portrait Rose paints of the extent to which reform becomes permissiveness, licentiousness, and finally depravity.  As counter-reformers, we should take note of the perils encountered by the Left in their zeal to remake the Church into a secular-humanist social club.<br />I'm holding out hope that Rose will next set his crosshairs on Catholic education for the laity, and send a few well placed salvos into Notre Dame &amp; University of Dayton.	2003-02-23

Edmund Morris provides the most chilling example of &quot;what can go wrong&quot; with his atrocious &quot;Dutch.&quot;  By way of contrast, William Manchester's &quot;American Caeser&quot; is an excellent example of a biographer successfully coping with a subject that he just doesn't  quite understand.<br />As always, Manchester's writing is brilliant, his story compelling, and his subjects infused with life and reality.  However, the central theme of the book rings slightly hollow.  One comes away with the feeling that there's still a little bit of MacArthur that remains unexplored.  Manchester's title is apt, and his analysis of MacArthur as a dichotomous, stupendous, but fatally flawed man is reasonable, and he just about convinces me that this is the whole picture.<br />You really can't go wrong with this book, but I would recommend reading it before you read Manchester's Churchill stuff - just as I would recommend eating a crab-cake appetizer before a 48-ounce prime rib.	2003-02-23

Rather, it is the passionate and tortured drama of the conversion of a great soul.<br />As an introduction to City of God, Confessions is indispensible.  But as a spiritual guide, it exceeds all comparable works.<br />The fascinating thing about Confessions is that it serves so many purposes; it is a nice review of historical heresies and education into the passion with which heresy was once viewed.  It is also an astounding argument for the power and transcendance of faith - Augustine's metaphors begin to take clarity only after the book has started to have its effect.  The various divergences into philosophical questions concerning thought, knowledge, and memory are at least as entertaining as those of Aristotle, and far more germaine to the faith.  Augustine's story itself is of great interest - simply compare what he considers to be sinful to what our culture accepts without question.  But it is inspiration and motivation that is the book's greatest asset - all of its other features become meaningless without the central fact that this is a book that will strengthen your faith.<br />In a previous review, I noted the absurdity that I was reviewing Sun Tzu's &quot;Art of War.&quot;  I echo that sentiment, and will only add here that aside from the Bible, I do not know of another book as profound and important as this one.	2003-02-23

After all, the Brits and French have been trying to out-snob each other since at least 1066.  Nevertheless, until recently, I was unaware of the extent of this tacit anglophilia.<br />Cobbett's book is a key step in reconstructing an alternate history of the rise of British dominance.  It is certainly worth note that his predictions of doom & gloom for Britain did not bear out, and the seeds of the industrial revolution that he deplored as a result of Protestant reformation were to eventually lead to a depth of world prosperity that puts his recitations of the daily diet of the yoeman to shame.<br />While keeping in mind that this is a work of propaganda, it should be simultaneously borne in mind that this is really a work of counterpropaganda.  I don't really buy the \\"Cobbett was a Protestant\\" argument, as his vitriol is a little thick for a sustaining member of that segment.  Nevertheless, the viewpoint he brings is worthy of note in that it is seldom heard with respect to the truisms of English History.<br />I would like to see a historical refutation (note that I refuse to say \\"an historical refutation\\", because I pronounce my \\"h's\\").  Cobbett certainly argues for the veracity of his own data.<br />This book will anger you or amuse you, alternatively.  It's a nice study in how grudges get carried on for centuries.  It's also a nice example of how time can accomplish great things, transforming Elizabeth into a movie star and Philip II into a historical nonentity.<br />Well worth the read, if slightly high-spirited.	2003-02-23
