I reminded Milly that I review some sermon books without reading every sermon! After she had gasped, uttering words of disbelief, I explained that few books of even short sermons contain equally good sermons. On first hearing Barbara Brown, attending the Lectionary Homiletics Conference I remember how I was stirred emotionally, mentally, and spiritually with her dramatic imagination. I was seized by her creative images from the stories in whatever passage of scripture she had chosen.    On hearing her lectures about Job, I definitely looked forward to reading \\"Home By Another Way.\\" Here I found one earlier excerpts, entitled, \\"Out of the Whirlwind.\\" This is one of a few sermons in which she quotes from two sources, in those early lectures. I was impressed by friend, John Claypool's tributes to her \\"rare constellation of gifts: intellectual carefulness and depth,\\" all coupled with an artistic sense of image-making. That alone speaks volumes!      With my usual skipping over a few sermons, I was most attracted to: \\"God's Beloved Thief, Home by Another Way, God's Ferris Wheel, Lenten Disciples, A Tale of Two Heretics, Life Giving Fear(from time in CPE) \\"It Is Finished, Out of Whirlwind, Bothering God.\\" Most were notable for looking up-close at her perspective with intimate viewpoints by using tough disclaimers! They often appeared in beginings, mid-way or near her ending. There is one unique hitch in her re-telling the basic story: she often adds a touch of creative imagination to develop the problem with clever resolution relating to basic forgivness of weakness, judgement, or justice,       Placed within all ten books, I designate this one in being near the top of her Lectures and Sermons.

There is never any doubt for ten years since I first heard this lady Teacher-Preacher, this one-of-a-kind, Barbara Brown Taylor has sustained my interest! After hearing her first in Lectionary Homiletics Conference in-between Joanna Adams and Fred Craddock, I recall taking a risk to ask her to autograph one of her books. She proved to be a gracious listener. After exchanging E-mails about our mutual friend John Claypool, she expressed her thanks.    Dr Craddock gives her one of his rare accolades that she has the capacity to \\"sit on her own shoulder and report on what she sees and hears herself doing and saying.\\" Maybe this is why she has gained her ability to become such a creative story-teller!     To sustain my interest she uses 7 chapters to teach us about her intimate \\"Life of Faith\\" from, \\"a call, her imagination, belief in scripture and seeing herself in the pulpit.\\" My favorite of the second half of 13 Sermons is \\"Do Love!\\" She starts with her disclaimer: \\"All things considered, I am a pretty good thinker if people will be patient with me...\\" Every time I have heard her preach or lecture, that is definitely one big unnecessary  disclaimer! For this early gem of teaching plus Preaching Life, I only comment, it's the unvarnished sincere Holy Truth! retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2005-10-04

After hearing the esteemed, distinguished artist, poet, preacher personality as narrator and inter-locature for Deepak Chopra and James Hillman, I've read or listened to her everyday for months! Their tour of \\"Mythical Journey\\" came to Glen Memorial the EMORY Campus Church with packed house. There was a stage full of video cameras++ beautiful backdrops for a future TV show on NPR!     Listening to her dialogue with Deepak from \\"The Evolving Human,\\" becomes obvious how Houston is continually evolving in her naive talents: \\"for writing limericks, cooking gourmet meals or being able to talk to dogs.\\" In fact, one of her many books is The Use of Spiritual Theraphy with Animals! Her epic-autobiog, A MYTHIC Journey has exceeded any possible evaluations in hearing her at Glen Memorial.     The high-light Chapter of Altered States lifted me thru her own experience under LSD in Greenwich Village with a guide, Michael Corner, empowering her to use a dramatic exchange as part of her practise of pschotherapy! Those pages carried me smack into the request of help from eminent Gestalt psychologist, Fritz Perls to visit him in his Central Park Apartment. All these incidents were encouraged by Margaret Mead.      Her Mentors from age 12 included awesome, Tielhard de Chardin, she knew only as, \\"Mr. Tayer,\\" Joseph Campbell, Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niehbuhr, Margaret Mead, Martin Buber. Then I read that she conversed with Helen Keller, Annie  Sullivan, Mother Teresa, the Aldous Huxley Family.    It strikes me, she just as well included: The OT Prophets, Major Poets of England, even Jesus' disciples in the NT!       What an awesome, brilliant, encouraging, inspiring, genius of one single-minded personality! Semi-retired Chap. Fred W. Hood	2005-10-03

In Elie's moving study, imperfection becomes the starting point of spiritual journeys and the stuff of which wisdom literature is made.\\" Lance Morrow of Time writes as the best of 20 accolades.    The senior editor of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux describes, then contrasts the literary aspects of four great persons in American Literature: Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Flannery O'Connor, and Walker Percy. They are pictured in personal photos, first near  the title page and in the center of this lengthy book. Elie begins with their common traits of dress and description from Flannery O'Connor, on crutches in a black dress, to Fr Merton looking uncomfortable in his Trappist habit...yet with vitality shining thru his eyes. Walker Percy's face frames a smile as if just another duffer at the South Country Club. Shown in her old cast-off overcoat and neck kerchief, Dorothy Day maybe a Nun or Social worker, not the radical foundress of The Catholic Worker.    Chapter Two, \\"The Downward Path,\\" dramatically portrays downward paths of Thomas Merton as a youth in London, facing the loss of his father, Owen Merton. Merton's rebellion in feeling wounded, bereft, and helpless is parallel to discretions of Dorothy Day. The graphic pictures of his sordid affairs of behavior alongside his fierce sense of sinfullness, are cut-out by the Trappist superiors from his autobiography, The Seven Story Mountain.     One of Paul Elie's best habits is to enhance, as embroidery for his quotations: \\"Day meanders toward God; Merton throws himself headlong at God. For her, sin is dull and dreary. For the young Merton, sin is everywhere; grace comes gradually to wipe clean his soul, as life goes on... Faith slowly becomes his pathway thru the territory.\\"    Seeing their common downward pathways, I noted Elie's ability to picture their inner reconciliation with their Creator-God. Being more familiar with Merton than Dorothy Day, I discovered their personal relationships better than those of O'Connor and Percy. Yet I learned about the poignant lives of two awesomely creative writers living their faith in common struggles of endurance.      \\"The creative action of the Christian's life is to prepare for his death in Christ.\\" That fits-in with O'Connor's close friend, Mary Ann Long, who died amply prepared! The Dominican nuns had shown Mary Ann the value of her life and meaning in her death. Gratefully and graciously to being a bit-part of this American Literary Heritage.

He placed himself at the mercy of creation, at the mercy of a census, at the mercy of us mortals, even at the mercy of animals.\\" After being immersed in sacrifice, I find An Intense Moment in the Desert: \\"The desert is where we face the strongest and  most seductive temptations in life...where the enemy is most formidable, and where we are most vulnerable.\\"     Ken uses descriptive adjectives so artistically. He seems truely sincere, never boring. With the Insightful Moment at Nazareth, he creatively expounds upon Jesus reading the Prophet Isaiah in the Synagogue.     \\"Nazareth was Jesus' hometown. (Just in case my first readers may not know the fact) Nazareth's obscurity is surpassed only by its austerity.\\" With few words he sparks my imagination!     Two more dramatic moments compelled my total attention: Gire's  Intimate Moments With Peter and Insightful Moments of Character, focused upon the Beatitudes! Describing his Fishing with the disciples, Gire writes: \\"Above them hover squawking fluries of herons, cranes, and cormorants waiting to dart in and steal away what they can of the catch.\\" (To any salt-water fisherman that cuts it deeply)    Finally, An Insightful Moment of Character: \\"The Crowds were comprised largely of outsiders. Hardly pillars of the community.   What did they hear in His voice when he preached? What did they  see in His Face?\\" Then his answer comes in outline form: \\"He was poor in spirit...He mourned...He was meek...He hungered and He thirsted for righteousness.\\"      \\"If the world persecuted Him; What would it do to His followers? Similiar thots are included in his most Intense Moment about the Mountain-top, with more creative embroidery. Poor in spirit, mournful, meekness, hunger for rightousness... being merciful, being pure inheart, also a peacemaker.\\" What a wondrous way to end my Commentary...Awesomely full of Intimate, Instructive Moments with Jesus!

My first impression, paying respect to BLINK, written by Malcolm Gladwell, certifies this as not being simply one more humorous book. It is chock-full with gourmet recipes of our deep South tradition! Naming, describing, even listing of Ingredients for their favorite dishes, the Ladies of St. James' and Ladies of Greenville Methodist Churches, compete with fat-baked meals of Asparagus Casserole, and similiar, Thrifty Squash Casserole!      On first reading I noted many more words written about all their sweet-smelling, steamy hot dishes of Southern casseroles brought in early that morning for the bereaved family, than about their choice of hymns selected! Only five pages were devoted to their Delta Funeral Hit Parade. It follows immediately after selected recipes for Artichoke Spread, close above Deviled Ham and Cheese Spread! I noted the first named, Bourbon Boiled Custard was left off the Top Ten Parade, possibly because of her name as, Josie Pattison Winn of Greenville and New Orleans. She also was known as the \\"boiled custard queen of the Mississippi Delta.\\"          Chapter 3 is entitled: \\"Who Died? Stuffed Eggs, Etiquette and Delta Pate`.\\" After the logo: \\"People in the Delta look better dead whether in their coffins or obituaries!\\" Those of Delta's great fame are sited: Mrs. Robert Shaw, Augusta Jones, grad. of Agnes Scott as Art History Major, Olivia Morgan, Bubba Boone,  Taylor Tuthill, Miss Edith Wharton. It was Augusta, who fled to the New Orleans, French Quarter as Night-Club Singer, hanging-in her own private \\"Hippie\\" Colony!    My favorite Chap 5 \\"Comfort Foods: There is a Balm in Campbell's Soups\\" as sung to the tune of \\"There is a Balm in Gilead.\\" One guaranteed not listed anywhere near the Delta Hit Parade! There you will find \\"Amazing Grace, How Great Thou Art & Sweet Beulah Land.\\" Scouts honor...All of those are totally banned at the St. James' Episcopal Church, and canned for the local Funeral Home Services. Filling-out at the bottom of the list...\\"Being Dead Doesn't Mean You Will Have Good Taste, follows, \\"On Eagle's Wings, In The Garden, and Beautiful Isle of Somewhere!\\"     As expected by more careful readers: It's all one big Enigma, to set the stage for bringing Comfort; Peace from sadness ++ One of the funniest: Chap 5's far-out: Crocheted-Bed-Pan-Award Chicken! It makes me sad to say I cannot accompany this review with some deluxe sound-track of sly side-remarks in discovering clever parallels between those gourmet foods and their few hymns of Comfort!

Who other than William Sloane Coffin has gained enough expertise sufficient to quell Doubters of any Age?      While serving as Pastoral Chaplain in Georgia Diagnostic Center, alongside Drug-Alcohol Rehab groups and in Worship Services, I discovered in reading his sermons, his dramatic passionate plus a truthful direct approach, addressed needs of prison inmates.     I soaked-up Coffin's first writing in \\"The Courage To Love, also in A PASSION FOR THE POSSIBLE. They guided me two ways: to meet complex needs of addicted inmates, but also to give me wee bites of material in carving out personal growth to write and deliver sermons based upon Homosexuality, To Face both Suffering and Death, Being Open to Change, Seeking Justice for Minorities! The same issues are addressed in \\"Letters To A YOUNG DOUBTER. W. S. Coffin's simple language yet profound, relaxed, laid-back style is also reasonable, thoughtful, keenly passionate, even at times humorously questioning the young Tom.      Upon hearing W S Coffin preach sermons at the Montreat Services in mid-1980's I was personally impressed by his singing Bass in Elaine Brown's Choir, seated next to me! From deeper personal reflection, I found his love and respect for beauty in music alongside personality, when he questioned me about \\"that young lady who was singing Soprano part in the Vivaldi Duet.\\" My only anwer could be, \\"She happens to be my Wife!\\"     That gave new perspective in hearing his mellifluous bass voice, both in singing and prophetic preaching. I admit never feeling comfortable as others, in calling him \\"Bill\\" Coffin! In speaking with Davis Perkins, his Publisher: \\"I never interviewed another  Author with his many interests or keen imagination. Others whom he had published were Walter Brueggemann and Elie Wesel!     Added to the simple beauty & profound truths illuminated in this brief treasure, I am blessed by his Easter Sermon from Riverside Church, \\"Like Him We Rise!\\" I commend him, adding my prayers for his continued endurance to not \\"being the victim\\" from his heart problems in California.

He always seems like an old, yet still youthful,  and wiser, more knowledgeabe... \\"Good Friend!\\" From my first early physical in his Fayette Medical Center, he finished-up in using his usual \\"recorded Review\\" of my visit: \\"within my new patient, Fred Hood, the first words I heard were...Depression!\\"      Earlier I had met Dr. Sams, visiting his older, medical patients in Fayette Community Hospital! His nephews John Goza and Frank Cole were hospital staff Doctors. One day after Pastoral Visits I chanced to converse with both, as to how come \\"so many members of the Sams family\\" had chosen to become Doctors?\\" They quickly agreed that it was strictly because of Sambo's influence!       Once I began reading this EPIPHANY, his 7th book, I discovered along with his other reviewers, Sambo is the epitome of a superb story-teller! He can quickly draw one into his uniquely creative pictured characters of personality. His strengths for using Mark Goddard and Gregry McHune as his colaborators becomes obviously related between his actual life as husband and his wife, Helen!     I sat waiting in his office with new book of Prayers written by Professor Walter Brueggemann, as Sambo entered and saw that same book I had given him earlier. \\"This morning I was reading his 4th Prayer, \\"Stunned By Morning.\\" Then he proceeded to quote the whole page of prayer, word by word without looking at the book!      In all of our conversations about his writing or what he's up-to in reading... he seems totally interested and caught-up becoming interested to my questions or reponse to his stories. Whenever we get to our \\"process of physical aging\\" he's agile, positively humorous, and places total emphasis upon inner, spiritual and  mental attitudes. I am definitely an avid admirer of the medical expertise, powerfully gifted story-telling of my personality care-taker, who analizes, diagnoses, and even fullfills his own prescriptions! May he continue being the Blessed Physician for us for many more moons! Retired Chaplain, Fred W Hood	2005-08-04

They combine varied length of lines, 2-3 verses, are both rhymed and free-style; SUMMER SOLSTICE is like Prose with a bit of punctuation. SOTTO VOCE has no punctuation, yet simpler and more personally focused!          Regardless from each perspective, anyone looking into Stanley's  Poetry, may find he becomes less & less an Enigma!

Most of whom may agree with Harrelson's quotation: \\"I would insist that man cannot live a fully human life without acts of celebration!\\" From such an inclusive theme, WB briefly discusses the accents of Deuteronomic and Priestly traditions from within Deuteronomy, Leviticus, and Numbers, as offerings of \\"Word and Sacrament.\\"     From these statements he proceeds to graphically describe events that illuminate Hebrew Festivals of celebration from the \\"Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to Jubilee, to Purim, to the Festival of Hanukkah!\\" Somehow from his ample beginning, may we endeavor to  experience our profound Hebrew scholar and articulate professor playfully relate themes of Ancient Israel's Worship to Theology of Israel within his Old Testament resources!

Lots of us sang Waring versions of Christmas Carols; Battle Hymn of the Republic; Onward Christian Soldiers; Dry Bones; surely, Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, not-knowing who created crazy-looking phonetic syllables! We waited until mid-1950's to become aware of Robert Shaw's Collegiate Chorale and its successor the Robert Shaw Chorale. Most of us first heard early RCA records of JOY To The WORLD; A Treasury of EASTER SONGS (with young! picture of RS)++Christmas Hymns & Carols; followed by DEEP RIVER and Spirituals in 1957.      Professors Blocker & Page paint vivid pictures of early years of Robert Shaw! Moving on to Chapter 2- THOUGHTS ON MUSIC, SINGING, REAHEARSAL, PERFORMANCE...we're introduced to his fascinating Choral Notes from 1970 to 1996. My favorite section is titled QUIET SINGING and COUNT-SINGING. Anyone lucky enough to sing in his rehearsals was exposed to quiet-singing (above a whisper)-- My good fortune began in Westminster Choral Workshops of 1973, 75, 77, again in 1986 Saratoga Springs, Carmina Burana & Brahms' German Requiem.     When Blocker named Shaw's absolute minimum essentials include, (as Caroline spoke to me, He has perfect rhythm; He knows the Time night or day to the minute with no clocks!) \\"Music is Order in Sound and Time!\\" Only God knows how many unique singing souls he introduced to permanent essentials ingrained in their music!     I must delve into his longest, most valued Chapter of CONDUCTING THE MASTERPIECES! Naturally he starts with Bach's B-Minor Mass and Bach's Passions of St. John and St. Matthew... Added to the longer Masterpieces we find Rachmaninoff's \\"The Bells\\" followed by \\"Liebeslied, Schicksalslied, Nanie\\" by Brahms! It seems as if anyone writing about Shaw, \\"Blocker could not escape temptation to include Gustav Mahler, Mozart's Mass in C Minor, Hymns and Christmas Carols, Verdi's Requiem or Poulenc's Stabat Mater!

His first ten poignant books of narrative sermons often resound in my memory from his struggles with diagnosis of multiple myeloma in June of 2003. After victorious stem cell transplant, he has returned for replenishment with the strongest Chemotherapy yet!

Recently to Washington and Chicago for the Lectionary Homiletics Conference, back to a final Commencement Service of McAfee-Mercer School of Theology!      In a brief intro to this simpler, more descriptive account, John re-creates from his store of unique parabolic and paradoxical stories of Jacob, Esau, Joseph & Brothers. He adds their awesome relationships to quotations from Earnest Campbell, Paul Tillich, MLK and Simone Weil: \\"Creation is the moment when God ceased to be everything so that humans could be something!\\"      In his unique U-turn, John borrows from that creative spark of a spontaneous teaching style: \\"According to Genesis, this 'dark turn'(Freud) of what began as a joyful adventure brought utter anguish to the heart of God.\\" In his compact Intro, he gets to the heart of his total Theme: \\"Let me describe what I mean by the words \\"God, The Ingenious Alchemist, and use those wonderful old narratives to illustrate and, hopefully, illumine for you an insight into the nature of the Holy One!\\" These are \\"the first words of an on-going conversation...\\" Not the \\"Last Word...\\"     Surely an appropriate disclaimer, written only months before his untimely death on September 3rd of 2005.

When I glanced thru her descriptive Chap. headings I was captivated by what she promised in her organized sequencial progress toward the goal as any good Professor/Writer.    She had me neatly hooked by \\"Recovering the Spirit; Vivifying All Creation; Gathering a People; Empowering the Christ; Chap 6, Transforming Unfinished Presence!\\" I caught onto her interesting style of writing with stories in first chapter of her classes in Systematic Theology! That itself is a huge challenge for any seminary professor. No doubt after a few years, she is surely prepared to become Presiding Professor of Central Baptist Seminary!        \\"The purpose of this book is to reconfigure the sphere and character of the Spirit's action in order to provide a more holistic pneumatology.\\" What a play on words: \\"holistic and pneuma.\\" (Greek for spirit!) I wonder how long she spent writing that sentence?     Professor Marshall brings us gently into an understanding of \\"perichoresis.\\" With her keen insights and simple description:  \\"That relationship of mutuality in which persons draw their identity from being related to others. It is an ecstatic dance in which the Trinitarian persons literally 'stand outside  themselves' as they evoke a life of their divine counterparts.\\" Up steps her neatly worded footnote *30!       As most every chapter she begins chapter 1 with 55 footnotes! In my 2nd favorite chapter 6, she quotes Prof Walter Brueggemann as observing the recurring theme of God's face, present but hidden, shows Israel's ambivalence about knowing by \\"seeing.\\" Not only has Prof Marshall adequately done her homework, it seems she has made habits of some prominent theologians: \\"Never having too much research!\\" She listed 17 pages of Bibliography, with much emphasis upon Profs John A.T. Robinson, Dale Moody, Wayne Oates, Frank Stagg, Sallie McFague, J. Moltmann, Pannenberg, Marcus Borg,adding Walter Brueggemann and Elizabeth Johnson! What an awesome listing of distinguished, notable, respectable sources!           I give my tributes to this lady's thoroughly documented and divinely inspired writing!

She is True to Prof. Bruegge's description as that \\"One Fearsome Lady!     I am also struggling with \\"Genuine Faith\\" that can rest firmly upon the Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed. Growing-up serving on Baptist Church Staffs for 50 yrs I took neither Creed very seriously. From my perspective as new Episcopalian I've arrived at deeper understanding of ways Sister Joan defines her personal Faith, Hope, and her Belief.     I dare not miss being continually \\"Surprised by Joy\\" with her metaphors of the Suffering of Jesus! She refers to \\"this vale of tears\\" in her longer and stronger chapter!     A careful thoughtful reading of her quotations by Francis Bacon, John Donne, especially Kierkegaard could possibly convince her reviewers to avoid being critical of her Catholic Value as One Super Valid Scholar!

I might even be in their company, had I stayed into dear Mother's Scofield KJV! In early 1950's \\"Searching the Scriptures\\" by H.E. Dana gave to Seminary students new freedom to add literary ++historical criticism to our tools of interpreting Scripture. Now that's accepted by both English and German theologians 'specially in schools as Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta. Here I quickly sought out the renown scholars and writers as Sir Walter Brueggemann, Charles Cousar, Kathleen O'Connor and Oxford's Brian Wren!       I point to four examples from PLAN B: \\"In last Sunday's Sermon, I took my opening story from Joshua 2 about the Spies sent to Jerico by Joshua; who decided to keep covered from Jewish publiciity in staying with that best known prostitute, Rahab the harlot!\\" Most of us have employed her same story for prison inmates who easily fall into that plot! I admit to not being so offended by her use of expletives as the F___ word! Also she describes their pet-half/Lab and half/golden retriever as being like \\"Jesus in a black furcoat or Audrey Hepburn in Blacklama, elegant and lovely and silly!\\" (What a Tremendous Gift for Unique descriptions!)      Other Interudes I choose are her quotation from Wendell Berry on page 39: \\"It gets darker and darker every day and then Jesus is born!\\" Also the night she could not sleep for wondering if she really was a good Mom, \\"If I actually threatened to have Sam's  pets put to sleep!\\" I did not cotton to her stories the time she insisted on being in-control of Sam's required attendance at Church! She openly inserted comments about teaching San Quentin inmates her art of storytelling! Here is when she uses her great quotation of Dr James Forbes, \\"Nobody gets into heaven without a letter of reference from the poor. Obviously 'the poor' includes prisoners.\\" Later she begins a Graduaton speech with her neat disclaimer: \\"It must be a magical day for You all. I would never know...I accidentially forgot to graduate from college!\\"      Upon hearing Anne read from Plan B ++ Fielding comments, I'm in total agreemeent with Michele's words: \\"Refreshing & Honest as a Christian!\\" Totally a real authentic Person...as Beth calls her the type person, Christ would have enmbraced! To join those who believe in her honesty, humaness, searching for truth along with her Monologist, Pastor David Roche +++ Sue Schuler, slowly dying with cancer: her two awesome quotations are, \\"Rest and laughter  are the most spiritual and subversive acts of all. \\"Hope always catches us by surprise.\\" For our minority I claim her as One who is positively Gifted!

Bruegge	Sister Joan's battle with \\"struggle is neither endurance nor denial...\\" She begins with the chapter, \\"Struggle of Change\\" as a private battle! Then she carries us through her process of the Gifts of Conversion, Faith, Courage, Independence, Limitations, Darkness, Surrender, Endurance, Struggle of Scarring... Finally  comes the essence of her Old Testament Theme: \\"Wrestling with God\\" to her Big chapters into Hope! Most of these chapters have progressed from her private battle becoming the Public Battle in her awesome experience. Thus the chief reason for Prof Walter Brueggemann describing her as \\"One Fearsome Lady!\\"    Upon arriving in my second reading of her chapter on \\"The Gift of Independence, I was caught-up by her graphic short sentences  descibing Independence: \\"We can dream again... We can go on without learning or withering. Isolation erodes spiritual independence... But the truth remains. Nothing lasts! At its healthiest, the human spirit is irrepressible and the human heart seeks hope!\\"  What a tremendous statement of spiritual optimism!     She concludes her key chapter with an agreement, noted in other reviews, that she no longer writes fiction but a great number of other things and has loved every minute of it. As introduction to her hopeful thoughts she quotes the Persian mystical poet Rumi: \\"I saw God drinking a cup of sorrow and called out,   \\"It tastes sweet, does it not?'   \\"You've caught me, Grief answered,    \\"And you've ruined my business.

Simply to profit from reading two books by one unique author is Good News to me! It often happened with Sister Joan Chittister, Karen Armstrong, Sir Walter Brueggemann, John Claypool, Barbara Brown Taylor and William Sloan Coffin.     At least two things about Sister Cynthia's writing impress me: Her neatly awesome, appropriate quotations before each of her five chapters: One, \\"What you dare not hope for--that is what He gives you.\\" (Frere Roger of Taize`Community); Two, Psalm 103:11--\\"We swim in the mercy as the endless sea.\\" ; Three, \\"The Notion that God is absent is the fundamental illusion of the human condition.\\" (Thomas Keating) Four, \\"In the middle of winter, I discovered in myself an invincible summer.\\" (Albert Camus)      In the strongest Chapter Five \\"Hope and the Future\\" she employs  powerful sub-titles. Then as \\"Inner and Outer\\" she writes keenly about \\"contemplative prayer\\" being equal to \\"piercing prayer\\" which she experienced in a deeply personal relationship with Snow Mass priest, Rafe as they followed Thomas Merton. Under her next sub-title she explores as \\"the visionary insights at the heart of Christian mysticism\\" emerging from Jacob Boehme, Merton, Julian of Norwich, Hildegard of Bingen and Barbara Brown Taylor! These examples of her smoothly flowing style capture my imagination and I continue to see this as her strongest book! Accolades to one superb Lady... Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2005-02-11

Upon hearing about Sister Joan from Sir Walter Brueggemann and Patricia Hallum who are both avid readers, I tackled her two latest treasures. Bruegge's awesome evaluation after speaking in Mississippi Conference last year with Marcus Borg, Bishop Spong plus Sister Joan was simply \\"She is a fearless Lady!\\" All of her writing has great simplicity, profoundity, richly mined metaphor plus an awesome collection of Epiphanies. Some of her numerous quotations by Teresa of Avila, Julian of Norwich, May Sarton, Sue Monk Kidd, Donna Schaper and Marie Fortune: \\"In the midst of profound suffering, God is present and new life is possible.\\" As personal response in her Journal: \\"Why is God in suffering? Maybe because, in those moments, there is little of anything else there! Only in God can we come to see the broader view of suffering....Suffering pares us to the core, strips us of our complacencies, and leaves us naked of ourselves. Suffering exposes us to ourselves!\\"      Other than Karen Armstrong, who provides her personal accolades on the book cover, Walter Brueggemann, and Barbara Brown Taylor, no one else inhabits my ballpark as equally inspiring, noteable writers!

Those who hear him in person agree he is sincere as he appears on the screen       Although much space is given for going to war with Iraq, I was attracted to his appeals to non-violence and teachings of Jesus. As teacher of seminarians he has emphasized divinely inspired writings of Martin Luther King, Jr. with distinguished teacher and mentor of MLK, Howard Thurman!

Private religion avoids the public consequences of faith. The conflict over a private versus public God came early for me. I was born into an evangelical Christian family, raised in the American Midwest, and reared on Republican patriotism. We supported Eisenhower not Stevenson for President.

Whether one agrees about his underlying motives for writing two top-notch best-sellers or Not--You reviewers, please give this fellow, Malcolm GLADwell his due rewards. I am an Intuitive and  equally a Feeling and Thinking person. It seems he uses for his examples the works of a wide divergence of scientific study! For me his unique style soars with his Five Point Inventory and longest Chapter: \\"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory!\\"      This is especially true in \\"Perils of Introspection\\" followed by two Insight Puzzles. Becoming the assumed professor in, \\"Primed For Action\\" he describes a simple test to affect one's behavior! As Prison Chaplain, we sought ways to discover how we may affect Inmates' behavior while in prison. Later the author draws upon the Power of Imagination to picture the faces of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein! Closely related is an appropriate story of Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman who became effective in reading the faces of Bill Clinton. They perceived him as Peck's Bad Boy, who wanted to be caught with his hand in the cookie-jar.     Ironically they were right! This is one \\"layered story\\" as Fred  Craddock, tops in his field of Preaching, teaches his Theology  students about Parables.

All who lived during those momentous years of Southern turmoil of 1960's were greatly impacted by the laws of desegregation of the white churches and schools. As one renews his/her commitment to religious and social justice, it brings into focus our recent tragedies of Ruwanda, Iraq, Thailand, and Indonesia! Upon my own return to Professor Bass's BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS, I easily conjure up my perennial pictures of his accounts of eight white Ministers, their churches and families being turned inside/out or upside/down by Southern racial injustice.<br /><br />In Bass's easy reading, documented, and dramatically illustrated account of eight white ministers' appeal for law, order, common sense, before and after the reception of MLK Jr's, \\"Letter From Birmingham Jail,\\" I was transported back to 1963; Into mid-1965 when Earl Stallings became both my Pastor and my Good Friend! In spite of persistent segregationist pressure, not once did Earl consider turning black vsitors away from First Baptist Church of Birmingham. \\"If the people came to worship,\\" Stallings wrote days after the incident \\"we had no Christian justification for closing our doors...if they came to provoke an incident, we were determined to have no part in this action.\\"<br /><br />Since 1954 the FBC maintained an open-door policy for any black visitors. From an early distinguished Pastor J T Ford, followed by Guy Sloan and Grady Cothen and Earl Stallings they reaffirmed that policy! Yet on the morning after they welcomed the first black visitors, newspapers all over the country printed large photographs of a cheerful Earl Stallings shaking hands with the black visitors. They included both the NEW YORK TIMES and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution!<br /><br />From my perspective or from Prof. Jonathan Bass's perpspective, it appears that he gave a deeper account of the introspective thoughts or words of Earl Stallings, than from the other white ministers! Since MLK's Letter referred to outstanding persons' writing: Ralph McGill, Harry Golden, James McBride Dobbs, Ann Braden, Lillian Smith, and Sarah Patten Boyle, it seems that the author added deserving comments beside the eight pictures of those Ministers. Next to Earl Stallings picture he quoted his recent sermon: \\"We hear the call of truth, of righteousness, of justice, but we are not men enough to heed its challenge!\\"<br /><br />From 1965 thru 1975 in his next pastorate, I often needed Earl's commitment to equality and social justice, as when I chose music of Fred Waring's \\"Easter Story of Black Spirituals\\" over Church dissent: \\"It's getting much too close for those Black threats of violence in our streets of Marietta on Good Friday, April 8th of 1968!\\" That same evening for the Good Friday Worship we had a full house with a few black families present!

Who could resist reading this book after seeing that awesome subtitle of \\"The Mystical Union of Two Souls?\\"  Especially when it is told from a perspective of such compelling Theology as this intimacy of love between two persons! From the beginning of the \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\" by Cynthia Bourgeault and the Introduction by David Steindl-Rast, OSB, I became aware of her depth of this \\"Mystical Union of Two Souls!\\"     Nothing said by friends who recommended and loaned me their book even slightly prepared me for the powerful building blocks of this book! It kept me leaping from one level to another, almost as thrilling as shooting the rapids or going from low altitudes in a Jet Fighter Plane up to 35,000 feet level, without getting the bends! I ran through several examples of descriptions:      Chapter 3 on the \\"Mystical Completion of Souls\\": \\"These building blocks come mostly from the Christian esoteric (inner) tradition-- The Fourth Way of G.I. Gurdjieff--plus Christian hermeticism coming further from Jacob Boehme. The four building blocks are: 1) The union of souls 2) The idea of second body 3) The vow, or promise 4) \\"The wonders.\\"      Later in the same chapter she describes \\"the time of bodily life the soul has earnestly pledged itself [to another] but has not forsworn that promise.\\" During the last few weeks of Rafe's life before his death, he began \\"his crash course in enhancing his second body-- primarily through practice of \\"true resignation!\\" Although she describes theirs as a Physical Love story, it is totally  without maudlin, syrupy-sweet, love scenes or the usual sexuality.    My understanding was a bit illuminated from reading from both Jacob Boehme and G.I.Gurdjieff. It came again from, \\"the laying down of one's personal will, in order to be unconditionally present to the will of God. [Not all-together new!]           After three short chapters in \\"Wrestling with an Angel\\" she uses a profound quote from a distinguished Psychaitrist, Helen Luke,saying, \\"Wholeness is born of the acceptance of the conflict of human and divine in the individual psyche.\\" Immediately, she quotes Dylan Thomas: If the principal office of \\"love in this life is to unbolt the dark,\\" to release its prisoners of shame, it seems that our wedding garments in eternity are spun... Here I glimpsed her hazy picture of that second body as a spiritual body close to the description of St Paul in I Corinthians!      Cynthia stretches us into her own understanding of \\"The Mystical Union of Two Souls,\\" from her deepening spiritual love for her Hermit Monk, Raphael Robin.

As Prof Bruegge introduces the editor's preface of Jeremiah, he sets up parallel outlines for Isa 1:1; Hosea 1:1; plus Amos 1:1! He reminds all readers that we're in the tradition of these four prophetic books. He deftly describes the fourth as historically rooted in the priestly traditions of Anathoth, likely derived from covenantal traditions of Abiathar as I Kings 2:26-27, also  theologically as recipient of Yahweh's invasive, sovereign word. Most of his lectures on Jeremiah, begin with those traditions as Prophetic, Historical, and Theological. Look forward to hearing him make use of adjectives like invasive, sovereign, covenantal, alongside historical and theological traditions!<br /><br />Moving through the unique \\"Calling of Jeremiah\\" he proceeds into two visions of \\"shaqed\\" (almond) and \\"shoqed\\" (watching) only to use one of his 117 references to O.T. scholars. From the next chapter, \\"The Word through Jeremiah\\" he describes his familiar topic of the Wild Vine as the prophetic lawsuit, then introduces that remarkable poem of \\"Return to Me\\" in resuming his metaphor. Sir Walter moves precisely between sections of his outline with incredible ease, yet continually allowing class questions that often lead him into carefully related traditions!<br /><br />He supplied the final lecture for his Sister Scholar, Kathleen  O'Connor last Fall with his summary of Jeremiah's Oracles to the Nations and possible endings for the words from Jeremiah. After his ominous chapter entitled, \\"Terror on Every Side\\" then from the North; the result is Jeremiah becomes a Laughingstock from his words of Complaint, Judgement, Lament! As only Sir Bruegge can pull-off, he dramatized the emotions in Psalms of Lament using his key verbs: \\"deceived, harassed, abused, even raped!\\"<br /><br />When you hear the Words of the Prophet Jeremiah coming from such a mouth, as Walter Brueggemann's, be sure it is authentic, real, dramatic and introspectively awesome! Simply but powerfully true because ofhis continual affirmation, they are the Words of GOD! My good fortune has gifted me in hearing 3 similiar treats, his Montreat Conference Lectures, Central Presbyterian Lectures, also the McAfee/Mercer Seminary Lectures within two years!<br /><br />Be sure to expect new insights and visions from studies with the Prophet Brueggemann, on the Prophet Jeremiah!

In 1970's and 1980's I was on the receiving end of reading sermons from my Pastor in Huntsville. A short time after the death of his daughter, he quoted those who made his grief bearable being enrichened with meaning.<br /><br />In mid-1980's Barbara and I listened to him daily in a Montreat Music Conference. There we heard sermons about \\"Warmth, Warmth, More Warmth,\\" the visit of \\"The Magi to Bethlehem,\\" plus his oft' used metaphors from Kierkegaard, Frederick Buechner, Sam Keen, Madeleine L'Engle, and Fred Craddock. In the first sermon of this book, I borrowed his examples about changes from the old English words as Artistic, Awful, Awesome. The prison inmates on leaving those Chapel Worship Services after hearing his stories<br /><br />of miraculous healing, asked, \\"Chaplain, did that really happen?\\"<br /><br />Since I have reviewed six of John's later books, I have become aware of his increasing stock of stories from the sources above have been amply supported by many others from Anthony DeMello. One difference is a continual effort to connect up his sermonic material to the concerns and issues of his listeners.<br /><br />Gladly added by Retired Chalain Fred W Hood	2005-01-02

Now that John is already at home in  his familiar \\"Great-Not-Yet,\\" He may see his reviews at one Glance.     Compared to his admired CS Lewis, in use of adverbs: From a most-quoted, FOUR LOVES, Lewis used 36 active adverbs in his early 6 pages! Looking through John's later, THE STORIES JESUS TELLS, I counted 16 adverbs in the first 6 pages. Of course, gracefully, lovely, obviously, suddenly, surprisingly, are found in both books!     In my second reading, I grappled with \\"The Rich Young Fool; The Great Banquet; The Talents; The Treasure, The Pearl and the Net\\" all include themes: many-splendored universe, one of generosity, experiences of change, especially, \\"Life Is Gift.\\"       His attention to these recurring themes were first evident to me when Barbara and I heard John at Montreat in mid-1980's. Every morning for Chapel Worship Services, John in his freshness was exercising his themes in Sermon materials, Scripture texts, and particularly in his narrative stories from Anthony DeMello. I kept those tape cassettes of sermons, often sharing the same themes & stories in sermons preached to Prison Inmates in the early 1990's!      It was a long, often tedious journey from our common training at Southern Baptist Seminary, into the Episcopal Priesthood for him and long struggles with Myeloma and healing through 2 stem cell transplants. When we looked back over our experiences of changes and discovering God's Generosity, we agreed that Life is Gift.     Reading these Sermons on the Parables I reminded McAfee Students about their comments during discussions of his classic values of contrast, parabolic, even metaphor! Never can we dismiss his underlying themes of discovery in John's growth all thru his writings! Semi-Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2004-12-21

Bound in the colorful cover outlining two hands around a tender green plant above brown earth, Barbara Brown Taylor is symbolized as the Gardener who brings forth fruit from The Seeds Of Heaven!     \\"As the world grows smaller and followers of the world religions become our literal next-door neighbors, the question of Christianity's relationship with these neighbors gains new urgency; It may take us awhile to sort out proximity to Hinduism or Taoism, our nearest neighbor is and always has been Judaism.\\"    On hearing from her close friends tell of Barbara Brown's time-off to write her new book, I anxiously awaited my first reading. About the same time my close friend who is a Muslim Chaplain, spoke about her Columbia Seminary class visiting his Dec. Muslim Worship near the season of RAMADAN.    Her first chapter, \\"Exceeding Righteousness\\" pictures her unique way of interpreting the Gospel for other religions. Her urgency gains new momentum in the next sermon, \\"The Marginal Messiah, I wish I could tell you that Jesus death and resurrection changed  everything...That once the word got out what God had done with Him everybody saw the Light and turned toward it on the spot.\\"    From her tough CPE experience in a downtown Atlanta Hospital, she takes us into the inner lives of Matthew, Thomas, Peter with her inner thoughts about the Kingdom. After five flashes of the Gospel coming quickly, she says, \\"Jesus zings us with snapshot-like scenes glimpsed thru windows of a fast-moving train!\\" Her vivid use of the today's vernacular shows relentless urgency as she pursues her goal of showing us \\"how the Kingdom of Heaven is like this, and this, and this!\\"      Although I'm familiar with more of her Sermons as compared to hearing her lecture delivery, it is interesting to see how much more transparent these passages from Matthew's Gospel give an inside perspective of Barbara Brown Taylor! I first notated this in the margin ofChapter 13, when she speaks of not being sure this Parable of the Golden Rule sounds like Jesus. \\"It becomes necessary to look below the surface!\\" Her previous books do not  move as intensely forward with such interest and energy in their reliving the early miracle teaching of our Master, as \\"The Seeds Of Heaven!\\" AMEN!

It was his star-studded pathway into the forefront of the liberal, social gospel movement that led to Liberation Theology of the 20th Century! W R began his 4 yr sojourn as student in a German Gymnasium located in the small Westphalia city of Gutersloh. His father Augustus wished to expose him to German higher education. Then to mature him in the religious & cultural environment of his own theological orthydoxy of Lutheran Pietism. Years later W R commented on his education in Germany as bringing him to no outlook except soul-saving: \\"I had no outlook except a common evangelicalism!\\" He entered those years of 1876 to 1886 when Liberal Theology was influenced by Phillips Brooks, Henry Ward Beecher and Washington Gladden. They were strong influences upon the preaching, writings and teaching of Walter R. <br /> <br />Curiously his student writings lack references to the doctrine that became the cornerstone of later liberalism: The Kingdom of God. Many members of the Rochester Seminary were hostile to the theologian, Ritschl. W R would later embrace the persective of Ritschl and disciple, Adolph von Harnack, around the theme, The Kingdom of God. Even more revealing was the gradual maturity of his ambivalence toward the \\"institutional church.\\" The model he and others sought to implement: \\"The institutional church is a necessary evil. Make social life healthy and you can simplify the work of the church. Let poverty and helplessness increase and you increase work of the church too.\\"    <br /> <br />In 1918 the faith of Walter was focused upon death. One of his most famous, oft used Prayers was given the title by his wife, Pauline, \\"The Little Gate to God.\\" Reflecting the deep faith by which he confronted his early death at 56of Colon Cancer, he penned this prayer beginning, \\"In the castle of my soul is a little postern gate, Whereat, when I enter, I am in the presence of God.\\" Even Johns Hopkins Hospital could not uncover or give them any medical solution. His prayer captured the essence of Walter's understanding of the social gospel movement. He became  one of the Giants of his day as an example of faithful living, inseparable from the reality of social struggle and inevitable consequence of social struggle was suffering and death!\\"   <br /> <br />Christopher Evans, Prof of Church History at Colgate Rochester Cozer Divinity School has given us the definitive story of W.R. Called by Harvey Cox as a \\"timely and absorbing book\\" about the life of the most neglected yet outstanding person who stood at the beginning of Liberation Theology!

In drama-filled preaching of sermons, teaching classes, conversing with his friends, he was perennially full of Hope: Shown in such titles as, \\"The Basis of Hope, Strength not to Faint, leading-up to, \\"Life is Gift.\\" Most often his springboard was \\"Learning How to Handle Grief.\\"      In 1986 we heard John for one week at Montreat during the Music Conference. In hearing his stories from these and other related sermons, I commited to write reviews for his books and getting into one of his classes. As I look backwards upon his preaching classes in McAfee School, he frequently returned to these same themes or stories for his discussions. He expressed his love for Prophets, Isaiah and Jeremiah, especially in those Commentaries of Walter Brueggemann. Most class sessions were continued thru conversations afterward also in reflection sermons to Prison Inmates.       During John's struggles thru years in Chemotherapy he maintained continual Hope, even in his final days of Rehab during Oncology!      Whenever our paths crossed, he most often concluded by \\"Fred, I really want to live.\\" His early chapter, \\"My Basis of Hope,\\" repeats a quote from the Jewish Rabbi in Louisville: \\"Despair is Presumptious!\\" This reprint may be continued in my other book reviews: \\"The Saga of Life and The Hopeful Heart.\\" Gratefully into Eternity for his grace, peace & love, from one old friend, Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2004-09-08

I was deeply moved and greatly surprised at the profoundly unique, intimate insights of James Patterson, as he played upon all the strings within this story. Since my wife teaches Violin, Viola and Cello students, I could identify with  Patterson's creatively harmonized overtones of these varied string sensations. I only thought his forte was in the thrilling mystery of nursery rhythm titles!    <br />  <br />\\"For a long time it seemed to me that Life was surely about to begin...real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be got through first, un-finished business, time to be served, a debt to be paid!...Always my priorities are getting my health better!\\" Danny Kaye used to say, \\"Life is a big canvass; throw all the paint you can at it.\\" Jennifer writes her weekly column for the Chicago Tribune!

Added surprise is a sub-title of The Canon and Christian Interpretation. In OT Survey classes he contrasted his approach between Jewish interpretation with Christian inter. So I noted his quotes in using the 4 I's of Interpretation, Ideology, Inspiration, and Imagination! They occur in the Intro and near the end of his chap on Torah. On Page 11 \\"Now it will occur to an attentive reader that these facts of the traditioning process-Imagination, Ideology, and Inspiration (my caps)-do not easily cohere with each other! Specifically the force of human ideology and the power of divine imagination seem to be definitionally at odds. Precisely! That causes the Old Testament, to be endlessly complex & problematic, endlessly interesting and compelling.\\"    This carried me back to 2002 sessions at Montreat and Columbia upon first hearing his process of interpretation: \\"The interface beween the canonical and imaginative is exactly the way in which the most responsible and faithful interpretation takes place.\\" I can see & hear his trip from well-neglected notes on the podium up to the chalk-board, as he hastily wrote the Hebrew for his key scripture. In the dramatic Isa 6, after writing the \\"living creatures,\\" he sailed down the steps, waving wildly his arms all around the wall of the classroom singing \\"Holy, Holy, Holy!\\"   He seemed propelled alongside us into the living words of the Prophet. He earned his standing ovation! That was not the only Incident to stress his \\"Imaginative Remembering.\\"    My review of his process of interpretation in the Preface called to mind his statement: \\"You will not find anything new in my Introduction, since you heard it in all four classes!\\" I have yet to grasp his meticulous, continual thot about the generative work of the text in his process of providing an \\"alternative world\\" that invites faithful imagination! As usual he draws upon the giants of Amos Wilder and Raymond Brown. I am amazed at his memory in every class to give the right quotation, author, book, and even page number!      In the Preface he outlines his plan to use the Hebrew Canon as the normative list of books organized into three elements: The Torah, traditionally, \\"The Five Books of Moses.\\" The Prophets as Canon consists of, The Former Prophets, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings; the Latter Prophets of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel; plus scrolls of Ruth, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and the Song of Solomon. Lastly, he considers the revisionist historical corpus of I & II Chronicles, Ezra & Nehemiah, and apocalyptic scroll of Daniel. In spite of many texts & scrolls his coverage is unusually clear and simple!    Near endng his work on Torah he cites the characteristic task of Jewish teaching, nuture, and socialization to invite the youmg into the world of miracle...The preaching, teaching, and study of Torah is in order to set 'one's heart' differently, to trust and fear differently, to align oneself with an alternative account of the world. All this Israel fashioned and practised -imaginatively resolved, ideologically driven, inspired beyond interest -under the large, long, fierce voice of Moses.\\" Bruegge stresses continually \\"the truthfullness of YHWH\\" and insists that Bible Study is a life-changing, life-risking venture. One aspect of that venture is re-read Scripture for re-forming and re-reading go inescapably together.\\" In his conclusion before 20 pages of Autobiography, he finally shouts \\"innocently, critically, obediently, and hopefully!

Reading the other reviews of this \\"real genius woman writer,\\" moved me to place my own perspective. I first came under the profound influence of Karen Armstrong, seeing the Bill Moyer's Video panel on GENESIS. I have yet to ask Prof Brueggemann, on that panel if he agrees with me. In reading \\"The Narrow Gate,\\" I also had the same suspicion. On seeing her graphically painted pictures of magically described fainting spells, \\"The smell of bad eggs, an aura of menace, fractured lights, sickness followed by my slide into unconsciousness.\\" Her fainting spells being  ignored as a Catholic nun were put down as her unruly emotions! Not only did they happen at unexpected times but combined with a more positive outlook. It was apparent that her bad news of getting knocked back \\"even God for whom I had searched so long, was simply a product of a faulty brain, a neurological aberration.\\"     She was diagnosed finally by Dr. Wolfe with a mild case of Epilepsy, \\"which isn't the end of the world, it is even curable if we get it in time!\\" After her depressing years as a Catholic nun, she entered a darkness of more struggle with opportunities to continue her English Education at Oxford. During three years of teaching English at Bedford Girls' Academy, she was provided with another unusual experience of caring for Jacob, handsome, young son of Jenifer Hart. He was also a victim of Epilepsy, but his more serious and deeper variety. With his irreligious parents request she took him to the Sunday Blackfriars Mass. Later she participated in his Baptism with assuance of the priest that it would give him the necessity of religious structure of education.    Then came an adventure of writing, photographing, filming of the BBC Documentary, \\"Paul of Tarsus and Jesus of Nazareth.\\"  Months of return to her spiritual foundations became instrumental in helping Karen to re-evaluate her faith in God. She found the presence of God to be immanent in our world, even as \\"the ground of all being, in thedepth of the human psyche.\\"    Whenever I take time to share with another person the profound influence of this genius woman writer, I'm overwhelmed by her last chapter. She had been struggling up the steep hill from the London trolley, carrying a bag of heavy groceries, when suddenly comes the thought, \\"Why not write the biography of God?\\" That became a remembrance of some early impression of the spirit. Yet maybe only a slight inspiration from the Spirit of the immanent God.\\"  A great genius, woman writer, Retired Chap Fred W Hood	2004-08-13

By the fact of being close to my own age, I am totally impressed by Phyllis Tickle's creativity in picturing Epiphany moments out of her large family in Lucy, Tenn. My one regret is growing-up in East Tenn. I was not privileged to live nearby to Lucy, close to Memphis. While I identify being a member of the little country village of Hall's Cross Roads in East Tenn, it was very nearly the same sort of community that gave all small farmers a closely-knit, feeling of belonging! My sense from Phyllis' neat chapters on &quot;Noel, Holy Mother, The Joseph Candle, Christmas Eve Gift, Silly Sally's Gift, and Name This Child&quot; all create their closely-knit Family in activity reflecting the Christmas Story! <br />Once I got into the chapter on the &quot;Days of Thomas the Doubter&quot; I noted her carefully portrayed choice of gifts for Laura, &quot;one of the older, newly-wed children...just starting a home.&quot; By St Thomas Day, &quot;as my mother used to call it, the Day of the Old Doubter Himself&quot;... She struck a familiar chord in my own sense of describing one of our favorite pastoral characters! In fact,  my own point in reading and writing about this unique collection of essays is that it becomes a great model for blending family antidotes into Reflections upon Holy-days and Epi-phanies that people our fondest memories of Christmas.          <br />If I only picture a couple of more impressive spots, they would lie in the chapter, Christmas Eve Gift: &quot;Appalachians conserve everything in order to survive a geography that has no intention of allowing them...or anything else to survive.&quot;  No pecans are indigenous to Appalachian mountains...just like East Tenn! I was smitten with Ms Tickle's creative pictures of her environment. In particular the family cracking and shelling nuts for nursing stations at Sam's hospital; also the informal relaxed manner of attire when the family sat around the kitchen on the Feast of St Stephen! &quot;We ate and drank andlooked for all the world like a Norman Rockwell come to life.&quot; Where else could I find a clear reality pictured in beautifully homespun words of real-life? <br />I am now a Fan of anything written by Phyllis Tickle, regardless if it is &quot;The Graces We Remember or Wisdom In the Waiting!&quot; Let me just soak it up for my writer's hunger and thirst for reality.

The ten reviews at the beginning of my copy come from such diverse places as Rocky Mountain News; Book Magazine; St.Louis Post-Dispatch; New York Times, +++New York Jewish Week all point to Potok's historical, literary approach!     I began with reading \\"The War Doctor\\" and was quickly mesmerized by the surgery of Doctor Rubinov. As he had performed drastic surgery on the Cossack, Trotsky, he gave extra care to our hero, actually an officers' orderly. It seemed obvious that Potok had returned to his early novels. He pictured Doctor Rubinov caring for the orderly; Possibly due to being taught the Holy Words of Hebrew Prayers. Hardly a good reason to promote him to a Comrade Lieutenant Shertov! Rubinov took the risk of giving him legal papers that sufficed for insurance back to his hometown village.     I was again mesmerized by Potok's wonderful description of Benjamin Walter in his third story of the Trope Teacher. \\"He was sixty-eight, and ailing. A tall, lean, stately man, with thick gray hair, a square pallid face split by a prominent nose and large webbed eyes, brooding behind old-fashioned spectacles.\\" Again I was hooked by his mystical reputation as a writer. It seemed odd, seeing Ilana as I. D. Chandal in the driver's seat of narrating the longest, most detailed of all the trilogy stories. Throughout his narratives, Chaim Potok places Jewish characters as if they are both Holcaust survivors and members of human history and literature.    After high epectations from his greatest writings of The CHOSEN, The PROMISE, and ASHER LEV, here is his mountain peak of writing in a newer genre of short stories. They appear to become riveted into whole creations, yet also Holy Creations! Maybe they shall reach into those hearts of more and more hopeful believers!    Semi-Retired Chaplain Fred W.

Watching prison inmates process into Sunday eve Chapel Worship services, I noted number of Peterson's \\"THE MESSAGE!\\" I became curious to read A Sampler Collection of his early writings and interviews. From his perspective as prof of \\"Spiritual Theology\\" at Regent College in Vancouver, to founder and pastor of 18 yrs in Baltimore, I enjoyed reading personal interviews from 1981 to 1995. My first reading of Pastoral work had been his \\"Five Smooth Stones of Pastoral Care\\" somewhere in the late 1980's. As CPE student, I was impressed with his deeply rooted theological approach to the pastorate.    For a retired Chaplain who continues to fill-in Sunday evening worship services, his interviews are revealing of another one who tries to stay abreast of contemporary novels and poetry. I identified in reading, Unexpected Allies from \\"Christianity Today\\" that, \\"I don't read novels to get sermon illustrations or poetry for quotable lines.\\" I honor anyone who continues to grow alongside staying in-touch with the creative process! He sounds as if he obviously avoided taking an easy haphazardly approach to the pastorate!      In Peterson's evaluation of not finding materials for growth of Spiritual Foundation from Seminary, I believe this is addressed today by numerous pastoral groups who are advertising \\"Spiritual Growth in Foundational Experiences.\\" I am aware of several in Georgia designated for both pastors and chaplains.    Although I learned much about his deeper theological roots as professor, writer and pastor, I also enjoyed prodding around in his discussion upon his 'word-world' studies of both Hebrew and Greek texts! Look-up or into his resources from a \\"mystical- center\\" of his Evangelical World! From one still...\\"Surprised by Joy\\" from the Logos!  Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2003-12-31

I have not been a big fan of this well-known writer since being assigned,&quot;The Jesus I Never Knew&quot; for a preaching class titled, Preaching Jesus in the Gospels. We were challenged to read two  books from perspectives of Yancey, Marcus Borg and N T Wright...<BR>I did not delve as deeply in Yancey's perspective. Now in this newest discovery of 13 persons who became his &quot;Unlikely Mentors To Help Him Survive the Church,&quot; I really became identified! <br />I too was a victim of the typical Southern Conservative, Labeled Fundamentalism. So when I went into the early years of seminary, carrying my Scofield Bible, I soon replaced it with what W.W. Adams referred to as your &quot;Reviled Standard Perversion!&quot;  <br />When I began perusing this new discovery in my favorite neighbor-hood book store, I loved his &quot;Unlikely Mentors&quot; because some of them had already adopted me! When I got into his Preface where he re-visited 9-11...then his first chapter where he describe his in-depth struggles with his church and small Bible college, I was hooked. Upon reading parts of his longer chapters on MLK, Gandhi, Robert Coles, I knew that I must buy the Whole Book!  <br />There he jumped-out at me with creative sub-titles, MLK- &quot;A Long Night's Journey Into Day&quot; ; GK Chesterton- &quot;Relics Along the Seashore&quot; ; Robert Coles- &quot;Tender Lives and The Assaults of the Universe&quot; ; Tolstoy and Dostoevsky- &quot;CHASING GRACE!&quot; After noted pictures of the giant intellect, Chesterton, who did't like to travel, since he carried his rollicking adventures around in his great craggy head, I saw how he had written over 100 books which were published as his secretary recorded from his first drafts! <br />On top of these creative, unlikely mentors, he spun his web more deeply through Robert Coles, Ghandi, John Donne, Buechner and Henri Nouwen. Each of these men touched profoundly my four lives since years in seminary...Churches, CPE, Chaplaincy, efforts of writing. Nothing in what I'm recently reading about writing on mentors, theology, or autobiograpy has sparked my interest in such a dramatic fashion!

Reminding me of hearing the Prison Inmates request within their therapy groups: &quot;Chaplain, what do those profound words of poetry mean?&quot; Bill Moyers addresses this question in satisfying ways! That may well have grown out of his training as a pastor. <br />For my read his interview with 90-yr old, Stanley Kunitz began with, &quot;What do you love most?&quot; A super reply, &quot;Most of all, I love being alive!&quot; For a poet who kept publishing his poetry at 90, he gave Bill his inner and out response by reading aloud two of his favorites: &quot;The Round&quot; about his seaside garden on the Cape which he created out of a barren sandhill &quot;my little Eden.&quot; Then he provided reminders of his early, most famous poem that one reviewer, an English professor called the greatest poem she ever knew, read or studied: &quot;The Touch&quot; which he read aloud. He was floored by audience reponse from the Dodge Poetry Festival, with cheers, whistles, applause, shouts of &quot;Bravo! Bravo!&quot;   <br />From ten other poets, only Jane Hirchfield was familiar. As Moyers asked for her comments on Zen meditation, she reminded me of a little gem by Anthony deMello, titled simply - &quot;AWARENESS.&quot; She gave her words of meditation practice also simply developing an awareness to this moment; &quot;As if you were to sit very quietly in the woods to be translucently awake.&quot; (like mind-fulness) <br />All in all, it speaks to me like another Bill Moyers Jewel! <BR>Retired Chaplain Fred W.

When perusing through several books on Kabbalah, I am greatly regretful that I had no influence from a Rabbi. My earliest encounter with Reformed Judiasm was far from the mystical perspective of Kabalah! When our Baptist Suburban Church toured into Atlanta to worship with Rabbi Sugarman's Temple, we had a double privilege of hearing one of the erudite Rabbis and one of the best cantors of Atlanta. Haskell Boyer was long noted as the former student of my own Vocal Coach! <br />Our young people were deeply impressed with the inspiring ritual of Rabbical Language, the reading of TORAH in Hebrew,especially by the Hebrew vocalizing of the Yiddish Lyrics. It was surely a  contrast between that worship and the Kabbalah. And yet Rachel Naomi Remen writes in her Introduction,that her Grandfather taught her &quot;that the Holy may speak to you from its many hidden places at any time. The world may whisper in your ear, or the spark of God may whisper in your heart. My grandfather showed me how to listen.&quot; <br />Imagine if you will what a Miracle may have been granted to us by having a Rabbi of Kabbalah for a grandfather. If we could have spent our growing years being inspired by the mystery of reading the TORAH and chanting those awesome Psalms in their original sounds from the Hebrew scripts. One of several that Dr Remen quotes: &quot;Blessed are Thou, O Lord Our God, King of the Universe...&quot; Following that text she names her &quot;grandfather, a man of many blesings.&quot; Of course those blessings were prescribed generations ago by the great teaching rabbis.&quot; <br />One of her most interesting Chapters is &quot;Keeping It Together.&quot; As part of a project she asked 73 physicians to rank the same list of 21 life-values twice... First, according to what was most important to them in their work, and then according to what was most important to them personally. Her list included values such as admiration, control, wisdom, love, power, compassion, happiness, fame, success and kindness. None of the doctors made two lists of the same ranking. In one case, kindness was number 2 on their personal list, yet 11 or last on their working list. Overall the doctors were dismayed, they did not find it possible to live by the same values personally, but strongly valued as their work-values. Finally her conclusion was stated by one man, &quot;as life diminishes you!&quot; He added that it comes only with your permission. I have done this line of questions with prison inmates. They pointedly responded much the same!  <br />There are several principles that jump out in Dr Remen's lovely  account of written blessings. Upon moving from her university atmosphere, she summarizes...&quot;Symbolism is the language of the unconscious mind; It is the deep wisdom that is part of how we are made.&quot; It was on this page that I noted her use of numerous adverbs: instantly, occasionally, personally, thinking, sharing, knowing...all participles and adverbs of action. My sense is that she likely practises effective Pastoral Counseling which is deeply healing for her patients!  <BR>Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2003-11-25

Since I never got to hear Carlyle Marney in person, I must be content to hear many of his sermons on tape. I name several of his best students and co-workers like James Berry who was his Minister of Music in both Churches! His influence was felt most strongly in his Sister Evelyn, my saintly Aunt Della Sweet, an admiring member of his first East Tenn College Church, who was his best Sunday dinner cook! My great Pastor and Mentor Carl J Giers knew him in Seminary and loved to quote him! John Claypool speaks of his long influence upon his life and writing mostly because of his compassionate touch after losing his daughter to Leukemia. I could easily add 6-7 more good names. <br />This superb Cecil Sherman Edition, followed Marney's &quot;Structures of Prejudice&quot; in 1961 and &quot;The Recovery of the Person in 1963. There is no earthly way that I could sum-up his writings and sermons in one essay or review. But to say that his devoutly  spiritual influence will be forever etched upon the lives of myself, my wife's harpist friend, Kaylynn Davis, a youthful admirer in Austin, Texas and persons like Jim Berry, John Claypool, Tom Conley, etc. <br />When one reads Marney or listens to his taped sermons you dare not let your mind lay-back in an easy chair! Not only was he the best-read Pastor of his times, but you will see and hear listing of names, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Karl Barth, Martin Buber, W O Carver, Kierkegaard, N T Wright. In this wonderful sample of the razor-sharp mind and spirit of Marney we are arrested by instant relating of creative minds and their connecting of sociology, theology and psychology. When Prof Brueggemann and his wife, Mary first heard Marney on their marriage trip to Montreat, he fondly remembers many of these thoughts I have only repeated. <br />For me as perennial student, I'm convinced that the melting pot of my growing Faith has been refined and refurbished by Carlyle Marney as continuously as by Prof Bruegge. For my money, time, efforts and thought, &quot;that's a pretty big Order!&quot; (Marney)   <br />I cannot miss re-reading this book again and again!

This newly published version of his \\"Stages of Life\\" (1977) speaks volumes about his personal stages, as noted by Erik Erickson, Carl G. Jung and Gail Sheehy!     In lectures on Preaching at McAfee School of Theology, he shared his personal Theology with young ministerial students, resulting in their smoother moving stages. \\"Prepare your sermons carefully and seek to reflect your own stages, even placed alongside those unique stages seen in your parishoners.\\" I heard this flavor by  auditing John's first class in \\"Preaching Genesis and Preaching the Gospels.\\"       After John's sudden passing there were three Memorial Services in Birmingham, Atlanta and Louisville. From this same revered book, \\"The Saga of Life\\" noted by friends like Professor Truette Gannon, he recalled John's personal words of growth as quoted in teaching experiences: \\"It is a wise person who knows what time it is in his or her life.\\" Due to classes at McAfee, having more young ladies than men, that only showed his good sense in it's Inclusiveness!      One of his better chapters, \\"Childhood: Anointed with Delight\\" John refers to Sam Keen in being closer to his Father prior to his death: speaking to him, \\"you took delight in us.\\" I had the sense of John's style as drawing contrasting illustrations from Gordon Cosby, Washingtn Pastor as he instilled confidence and self-esteem!     In his last chapters he fittingly concludes, Adulthood with his themes of generativity, intimacy and self-realization. These two sections on Adulthood were often subjects for some of our best personal and relational exchanges. I wholeheartedly affirm my recommendation to young and experienced Pastors!

In reading Soul Mates and Care of the Soul I was distinctly taken back to my time of 'Doing CPE.' In realizing the deeper values of taking care of the Soul, I have made it a practise of staying close to former Monks who teach me about contemplation and meditation. I point out 2 quotes.<BR> <BR>&quot;A Pilgrim was walking along a road, when he passed a monk sitting in a field...seeing men working on a stone building...he said to the monk, &quot;Who is that working on the abbey?&quot; Answered,  &quot;My monks. I'm the abbot.&quot; <BR>&quot;It's good to see a monastery going up.&quot; said the Pilgrim. &quot;They're tearing it down,&quot; said the abbot.&quot;<BR>&quot;Whatever for!&quot; asked the Pilgrim. <BR>&quot;So we can see the sun rise at dawn,&quot; said the abbot. <br />As another pointed reading appears twice I will also abbreviate: &quot;Sometimes in their chanting, monks will land upon a note and sing it in florid fashion; a syllable of text for 50 notes of chant. Melisma, they call it. Living a melismatic life in imitation of plain-chant, we stop on an experience, a place, a person, or a memory and rhapsodize in imagination!

Again he comments on numerous Sisters who have been ordained to the Ministry.          Sir Walter recently spoke at the Wheat Street Church for annual Preaching Celebration. His reader & liturgist was Murphy Davis, wife of Emory Prof, Ed Loring. Bruegge knew enough about their Ministry out of their Home, the Open Door on Ponce deLeon, to speak of them as being prophetic ministers with indigents, prisoners, and homeless!

Even after having read Carl G Jung &amp; Robert A Johnson, I found interesting commentary with Robert Bly's writings on the Human Shadow. When he began with his metaphors of &quot;the bag, the film can and projection,&quot; I quickly awakened to his supporting roles for Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson and Carl Jung! &quot;In the old Gnostic tradition that we don't invent things, we just remember...&quot; Then he calls on his three Europeans &quot;who remember the dark side best.&quot; <br />After covering his graphic three metaphors using Marilyn Monroe for &quot;her projections as part of her power-longing and childhood disturbance&quot; ...He moved into even more authentic resources with Alice Miller's &quot;Prisoners of Childhood.&quot; Later as renamed, &quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot; gaining popularity &amp; clout with many of us working with Prison Inmates!   <br />&quot;Many ancient religions...evidently moved so as to bring up the dark side into the personality slowly and steadily. Christianity has acted historically to polarize the 'dark personality' and the 'light personality.'&quot; Today this is surely not only true in the areas of Religions, but present day's &quot;dominant personality in the West tends to be idealistic, compassionate, civilized,   orderly as Dr Jekyll's...so caring with his Patients.(A good bit parallel with some Broadway Musicales!)  <br />When he really gets into my heavy personal resources, he delves into Joseph Conrad's &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot; &amp; &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; + Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn!&quot; From there, on to Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens and other Poets!

My trip to England's Canterbury Book stores, took me into Carl Jung's \\"Answer to Job\\". More recently delving into Robert Johnson's \\"Balancing Earth and Heaven\\" I was exposed to Madame Jung thru Helen Luke and ideas of \\"synchronicity.\\" Prof Jung referred often to this idea in his \\"Undiscovered Self!\\"     \\"Most people confuse 'self-knowledge' with knowledge of their conscious ego personalities. Anyone who has ego-consciousness, at all takes it for granted he knows himeslf.\\" People measure their self-knowledge by what the so-called average person knows of himself...coming forth as a very limited knowledge. Chapter Four, \\"The Individual's Understanding of Himself\\" begins: \\"The contradiction, the paradoxical evaluation of humanity by man himself is in truth a matter for wonder...man is an enigma.\\" That Jungian statement opened the door for Robert A. Johnson and Karen Armstrong to use his same adverbs as \\"enigmatically and implicitly\\" for efforts to describe their personal crises!    Chapter Six, \\"Self-Knowledge\\" Jung sums-up as \\"a positive answer only when the individual is willing to fulfill the demands of rigorous self-examination and self-knowledge. If he follows his intention, he will not only discover important truths about himself but...will have suceeded in deeming himself worthy of serious attention and sympathhetic interest.\\"      Then he relates the unconscious as an \\"only accessible source of religious experience.

Sharing Seminary years of 1955-58 struggles between trustees & faculty, deprived us of the influence of such Baptist giants as Dale Moody, T D Price, the great white Father, T C Smith, Clyde Francisco, Morris Ashcraft and 7 others.      All those 12 were asked to resign giving blows to many students. John and I served on a committee of Protestors sent to President McCall, with no avail!      In his earlier perspective he referred to experience of seminary years, as \\"in the community of grades,\\" I admit mine were much more of a community of grace! We took longer routes of gaining our degrees as teaching fellows. While a student in the halls of Theology, John called that his time of professional turmoil: \\"we needed to see with new eyes.\\" He was called to a large campus pastorate, when I was sent home to greater change in perspective of teaching Math! After a few years, our contacts were renewed through hearing his sermons and reading his books.    Re-reading \\"Opening Blind Eyes\\" I saw dramatic changes in John's life during his loss of Laura Lue and in his divorce. Both of us moved from large churches to smaller ones; his in Jackson, Miss. and mine in Huntsville, AL. About 10 years later when we resumed a relationship while doing CPE, we found another parallel.      After John's retirement from St Luke's in Birmingham, we shared new interests. \\"New in my Sense\\" of spending time in his classes of McAfee School of Theology. That became our shared acceptance of \\"Life as Gift\\" from mutual journeys of Hope! I hope to never tire of hearing John's stories on his experientially continuing quests--especially in these days of grieving his Absence. May it become true \\"that Despair is Presumptous!\\"      With great gratitude & deeper Joy, Semi-Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2003-08-19

In his &quot;Author's Preface to the Second Edition&quot; from 1982, he points to being convinced that &quot;the argument made here is still pertinent to the relentlessly contemporary agenda of peace.&quot; Then he identifies three things which have changed: &quot;The shape of the peace agenda in our society has become more urgent and more pervasive.&quot; Secondly, &quot;The way we interpret scripture has changed a great deal in the past several years. Third, this interpreter as author of the essays has changed in various ways!&quot;<br />While our professor readily admits to change, within one of his longest paragraphs in my memory of recent writings he admits to becoming more cynical about the prospects of peace, and more buoyantly confessional about what what is promised by God. Adding his usual four adverbs: &quot;We are profoundly enmeshed in a war system... enmeshed economically, psychologically, hermeneutically, and in every other way.&quot; What looks like unique simplicity at first glance becomes abundant Old &amp; New Testament passages to enhance his Reflections from Biblical authority. He is writing as One who has become more mellow in his inclusive piling-up on top of scholarly, pastorally, psychologically passion about his insistence for Shalom... But always contained in his alternative world of social justice. This he thoughtfully expressed in a recent sermon on &quot;Children of the Power-Bestowing God&quot; in the Ebenezer Baptist Church next to the Martin Luther King Memorial Center! <br />This has been my easiest of 14 reviews for Sir Walter's Poems!<BR>Well-worth anyone's time or thought for reading.

It would have been a more cohesive tribute to have read six or seven of the essays; most likely those from Columbia Seminary. For me it was that first potent chapter by Prof Brueggemann that made it difficult to follow his intensity and focus on the theme of \\"Being Faithful in a Pluralistic World!\\" It seemed from my first readings that only three other essays jumped out with such strong similarity to Bruegge's exegesis of Amos 9:7. His usual habit of reference to scripture passages from Genesis to Exodus to Psalms to Amos to Romans was only exceeded by footnotes! <br />Brugge starts with his \\"not so readily recognized nineteenth- century developmentalism that ethical monotheism...not only constituted a great theological gain, but brought with it an enormous ideological temptation.\\" It was proudly & doxologically affirmed that Jahweh was the only One to become accepted as the 'onlyness'of Yahweh and the 'onlyness' of Israel!\\" He proceeds to lay out a historical background for his thesis of \\"only one God and only one Israel.\\" <br />Charles Cousar, Prof Bruegge's closest long-term colleague at Columbia Seminary contributes his New Testament version of \\"Paul and Multiculturalism.\\" He exceeds Prof Bruegge in his similiar habit of paralleling NT references and also footnotes!<br />Daniel Migliore, distinguished theologian from Princton Seminary contributed: \\"Sin and Self-Loss\\"...Karl Barth on the Feminist Critique of Doctrines of Sin.

Without wasting time in the next paragraph Prof Bruegge relegates his familiar christological question to one of the ecclesial question. &quot;I understand preaching to be the chance to summon and nurture an alternative community with an alternative identity, vision and vocation...&quot; <br />Following his repeated fashion from OT Theology class he sets-up the unique parallel for an either/or alternative. His first dominant statement begins at Mount Carmel when Elijah challenges Israel: &quot;How long will you go limping with two different opinions?&quot; He cruises thru several texts from Joshua in dialogue about &quot;church growth&quot; and the community! Prof Bruegge always delivers multiple texts to support his major point of emphasis!  <br />One of his distinguished hosts at Mercer-McAfee Self Lectures on Jeremiah, introduced him as &quot;One who can describe the indescribable, who can explain the unexplicable and scrutinize the inscrutable!&quot; It was John Claypool who introduced our OT Professor.

The Bible provides a script (not the only script available) for a lived drama that contains all the ingredients for a whole life.&quot; <br />From my intro into &quot;Finally Comes the Poet,&quot; until my tenth trip into Bruegge's &quot;Theology of the Old Testament&quot; ...This gripping statement provides his bluntest, simplist, clearest formula for personal change and therefore spiritual growth!  <BR>Enough said for my whole-hearted vote of five stars!  <BR>RetiredChaplain Fred W Hood	2003-06-18

In spite of another good review..., I cannot help myself from bragging on this great \\"Unfolding of an on-going conversation with this Jewish Book.\\" Due to Prof Bruegge's repeated words that it's an amazingly complex Book...because the Jewish people are amazingly enigmatic, complicated people of history!<br />From Chap 4: Bodied Faith and Body Politic: \\"In older, seemingly better days the Bible spoke with a single voice concerning faith and morals... For over a century the dominance of historical-critical work has relativized the absolute voice of the Bible. His footnote, also uttered in Class: \\"The critique of historical-critism by religious conservatives, in my judgment is correct.\\" Next is a surprise: \\"Historical criticism was not especially interested in theological interpretation!\\" (This is news to me.) <br />Before getting to Chap 4, I was struck by Bruegge's emphasis on, \\"The issue that Israel and Israel's God (and those who continue this line of reflection) must always face concerns pain...\\" He pursues this theme in the next two essays: The Embrace of Pain; The Rhetoric of Hurt & Hope: \\"What is it about the Old Testament that is so odd and disruptive and restless that refuses to behave itself...?\\" Soon after those utterances he explains this question, \\"that rhetorical world is odd and crucial because it mediates ethical reflection through 'disclosures of hurt and articulations of hope.' \\" <br />My favorite essays, also longest are 7, Old Testament Theology as a Particular Conversation; No 8, The Crisis and Promise of Presence in Israel. A favorite picture of his growing theology is an \\"on-going conversation\\" with the OT or other scholars... Eichrodt and von Rad. Plus, \\"the aniconic character of Israel's God implies more than an absence of images.\\" He refers to the value of metaphors from such scholars as Sallie McFague. His favorite nouns besides conversation are speech, utterance, words of rhetorical questions. His opening prayers for each Class are filled with verbs like brood, command, confess, plead, praise, thank, yearn...also, often coupled in faith, generosity, love, pleasure, purity, silence, trust...evidence of his grouping in fives and sevens.<br />Since most of these essays have come from his years at Columbia, those who have studied there have watched his authentic, steady, consistent growth and mellowing into an ever-ready approachable Gentle-man!

When you read John's words of his pilgrimage in the late 1970's you become keenly aware of how he was shaped by circumstances. He had passed thru and survived the acute lymphatic leukemia of his eight and one half year-old daughter, Laura Lue. Within six weeks he was caught-up in reading Gerhard von Rad's words on Genesis when Abraham offered his son, Isaac. He finally writes about this in \\"Mending the Heart\\" twenty years later. He wished to discover more about that darkness and obscurity surrounding the ancient belief of offering your first-born back to the gods! In listening to John in his first \\"Preaching Genesis\\" class at Mercer-McAfee, two years ago, it was difficult for me to sustain his remembered emotions. We had both gone thru the loss of child and grandchild when we had desperately prayed they would survive with God's Miracle.<br />When I saw no review in the list of John several powerful books, I went back to re-read and look more closely for his growth of emotional strength! As we reminisced about our seminary >experiences he reminded me not to value the experience as much as to reflect upon the experience. We valued professors, Wayne E Oates, Eric Rust, Red Top Owens, Dale Moody and Wayne Ward. In his \\"Preaching Event\\" he alludes to seminary, being a \\"community of grades rather than a community of grace!\\" I felt differently because I barely survived with only a Masters of Sacred Music! <br />Looking thru John's Lectures, I caught myself counting how many persons he used as resources: Fredrich Buechner, C S Lewis, Sam Miller, Abraham Lincoln, Henri Nouwen, Daniel Levinson, Carl Jung, Gail Sheehy, Karen Horney, John Powell, John Killenger, Carlyle Marney, Loyd Oglivie, Helmut Thielicke, plus a few contempories.

From Rabbi Kushner's short two-page Introduction to his \\"Book of Words\\" he briefly describes in volunes of meaning: \\"According to the Hebrew Bible, God made the world with words.  God just spoke and the world became reality. (The Aramaic for \\"I create as I speak\\" is avara k'davara, or in magician's language, abracadabra.) Not only are words the instrument of  creation, in Judaism they are primary reality itself.\\" I Was Hooked by That!     The Hebrew words meaning most to me are, b'rahkah or blessing; hit-la-ha-voot or Ecstasy. Kushner stated: \\"There can be joy in silence or with tears...in their occasions joyous laughter turns out to be sacred.\\" The word ecstasy also appears in Bernstein's   \\"Chichester Psalms,\\" coming in the most dramatic moment!     The word for prayer has meant much: t'fee-lah as the Rabbi uses the phonetic spelling. In his last page for each word he writes a Kavanah or Living Spiritual Talk: \\"In prayer you need to know a 'script' so well that you can recite the words on 'auto-pilot' but not so well, that the words are habitual.\\"     I soon passed onto his \\"Book of Letters,\\" then, \\"God was in this Place and I, i did not know.\\" Again, it was Awesome: A Mystery! What a forcefully creative writer! Retired Chap. Fred W Hood	2003-01-31

To one of his more recent students in classes and lectures at Columbia Seminary, Prof Bruegge is already a Living Legend! In the beginning of every class there is his personal, inspired prayer to the \\"One Who Listens; Yahweh; Holy God; Giver of all our years; You, the God of Truth; You, You, You...\\" <br />Lately, in his OT Survey, I wrote a few snatches of his opening addresses to: \\"You, You, You giver of Life; You who are the One Sovereign Judge, King, Lawyer, Counselor...O God as we watch powers rise and fall, We watch ourselves, we watch and see the World. You who comes late and sometimes soon... Come quickly Lord Jesus!\\" <br />My thoughts often return to his opening prayers in every class. My wish for all of last year: \\"Why does not someone publish them?\\" So now we have many of them. From 1976: \\"You are the voice we can scarely hear...\\" From 1992, \\"Healing sovereign God, overmatch our resistant ears...\\" How many sparkling ways that he creatively addresses the Living Personal God! In these few weeks I have used this Jewel of Prayers, I have been particularly struck by the first group: \\"And then you; You...and therefore us; For how you hope; The other side of the street; Our true home.\\" The second section that I have re-read is \\"A people with many secrets,\\" and the 11th one, \\"The God we would rather have.\\"<br />Dedicated to \\"a long stream of treasured colleagues of 25 years at Eden Theological Seminary and 17 years at Columbia...with thanks and appreciation.\\" When I purchased this treasure in the School's Book Store, I first saw it in the hands of one of his friends from the Seminary Offices. Now the one who prays to the \\"Liberator, Redeemer, Emancipator...\\" will continue to be the one I know who includes his students in his caring compassion! <BR>Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood	2003-01-30

In one of his first classes at Columbia Seminary when I was present he used these five huge words beginning with I's. That immediately hooked me into signing-on for his Survey of Old Testament and next his Theology of the Old Testament.  <br />Brueggemann's first Chapter lives up to the Preface comments by William Sloan Coffin...where he introduces Prof Blount and then Prof Placher and finally in more detail Prof Bruegge.

If there is anyone who is more qualified or more compassionate to write about forgiveness after two chapters on Grievance and Guilt, then I hope to find that person! John starts with his friend Frederick Buechner in the utter despair of living with his Father's suicide. In one of his more recent sermons in Athens, GA. he refers to despair as the ultimate sickness of the soul. This can only be spoken as truth by one who has been in despair! I have heard John tell of his personal despair in the passing of his beloved young daughter, Laura Lue in traumatic years of 1968-1970. <br />That is his final story in this little jewel of stories. Three  others stand out for me...the story of Sam Keen and his Father, his childhood puppy, Jiggs, his friend telling about Charlie's passing. When John repeats these stories in sermons or teaching classes it is like reliving the emotions of those experiences! As he often says it is not simply the experience... &quot;it is the reflecting upon the experience!&quot;<br />This intimately personal collection of stories makes for an incredible gift to someone in grief or despair!

Anyone who imagines that reading is settled and eternally simple does not pay attention to the process in which we are all engaged, liberals or conservatives.\\" In many lectures, classroom discussions he has often referred to the failure of any passage having only one single interpretation! (This struck me recently in his talk at First Presbyterian Church, Atlanta when he made a firm assertion he was neither liberal or conservative.)

Now after 3 years I am involved with the heavy Theology of Columbia Professors Brueggemann and O'Connor! <br />When I looked back at some markings I had made in Dr. Sallie's heavy stuff I saw, \\"all or almost all, of the language used by the Bible to refer to God is metaphor...\\" She credited George Caird, one of my favorite biblical scholars. Her next paragraph stated, \\"A Hebrew sucked the juice out of each metaphor as he used it, and threw the skin away at once... Within the plethora of Hebrew images there is one category that stands--out-personal relational images.\\"  I had been looking for such simple profound statements for months of hearing Professor Bruegge! Even Doubley when she quoted Paul Ricoeur, C.H. Dodd, John Dominic Crossan, John Donahue, C.S. Lewis, Leander Keck, relating to Parables.   <br />She uses the phrase, \\"artistically creative imagination,\\" in her chapter in on Models of Science. There she quotes Ian Barbour, C.S. Lewis and Niels Bohr which takes me back to Barbara Brown Taylor's \\"Luminous Web!\\" I love Sallie's conclusion on the last page from the medieval Mystic: \\"Thou art an immense ocean of all sweetness...(Let me)lose myself in the flood of Thy living love as a drop of sea water...\\" Finally adding comments from Gerard Manley Hopkins and Paul Tillich.   <br />What a feast for Mystic Theologs!

She then proceeds to move thru the shortest chapter \\"The Evolution of Praise\\" heavy with the writers of Science. <br />My favorite, most heavily under-lined Chapter is, \\"The Physics of Communion.\\" After her statements from Albert Einstein, Galileo, Copernicus and Newton, she touches upon Niels Bohr, George Johnson, Fred Burnham, John Polkinghorne, even Alan Watts, Bennett Sims and Paul Tillich.

This is the same way she preaches...from Clarksville, to Atlanta, to Boston or to Washington. <br />...The last Chapter on Restraint is my favorite. There she quotes or refers to, Pascal, Rumi, Auden, Frost, Max Picard and then later tells a Jerry Garcia Story, of the \\"Grateful Dead\\" edited by Ken Kesey. Not only is she a Poet but an incredible story teller and knows the best from Robert Schumann to Samuel Barber. These last musical references are based upon \\"Jesus came among us as word.

After perusing several books on Kabbalah mysticism, not letting them 'sink-in', I went from Rabbi Kushner's Book of Letters and his Book of Words to this little jewel of Hoffman's mysical use of the 22 Hebrew letters. In his ten-age Part I he moves through developing Hebrew alphabet from the North Semitic tribes more than 3500 years ago, to Ezra the Scribe of the 5th Century, to the Midrash, to the Talmudic commentary on Exodus, to the 13th Century, Zohar (Book of Splendor)!<br />When Hoffman arrives at the Zohar he reflects on the statement that, \\"God looked into [the letters] of the Torah and created the universe.\\" From one of the early Jewish mystics, Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia he quotes the Hebrew letters as a means to arouse tremendous intuitive capabilities: \\"Look at these holy letters with truth and belief...[it] will awaken the heart to thoughts of godly and prophetic images.\\" In Abulafia's approach he suggests that one \\"begin to combine letters, a few or many, reversing and rolling them around rapidly, until [one's] heart feels warm.\\"<br />In teaching dysfunctional children in their teens, I am making good use of Hebrew letters such as: Yud, Reish and Shin...Yud  for the words 'yom' or day; names as Yoel [Joel] Yoneh [Jonah] and impulse for good and evil: yetzer hatov and yetzer hara.<br />Also, Reish as Holy Spirit [Ruach Ha-Kadosh]; healing [rafooah] and healer [rofeh]; Shin for words as Shabbat, Shalom and simcha [joy]and shanah [year]. These last ones fit beautifully with the name of one of the girls - Kashanah!

Having an advantage of being under Dr. Hustad's influence for over thirty years, we have witnessed his integrity of sacred choral and organ music used in worthy worship of eternal God. Regardless of one's chosen Church or Denomination there are no such strictly traditional requirements set forth in Hustad's True Worship as noted in the other reviews. Only one of the three reviews gives an accurate appraisal of Don's distinction between traditional and contemporary worship. <br />He clearly stated in his classes at Southern, accepted by most of his students, the definition of Contemporary Iconoclasm. I am suggesting that could be rather prickly wording to prompt such an emotional response to his definiton of Iconoclasm. During his written discussion of Contemporary Music in Chapter 8 he refers to Robert Webber's book, Worship Is a Verb:\\"Worship is something we do and not something that service leaders...do for us.\\" This has been one obvious case of division among Southern Baptists with a newness of creative worship as used in some CBF Churches or Cooperative Baptist Fellowship! <br />I have heard Don do his Hymn Festival on the Vision of Isaiah in Appendix III a number of times. The first time was in the early 1980's for a cosmopolitan group of South Carolina Ministers. This was an awesome time of worship when all the 30-40 various ministers responded with prayers, testimonies or solos. Just as in two Sunday evening church service, he guided those several  contemporary hymns from the piano, including How Great Thou Art, Kum Bah Yah, Medema songs, Come Let Us Reason, and Lord, Listen to Your Children Praying. For each time focused on contemporary worship, Don seemed sincerely guided by integrity immersed in the Presence of the Holy Spirit's Leadership. <br />I am still in an such an inimate relationship of appreciative reverence, no matter where I am influenced by this Christian Gentleman.<BR>Retired Chaplain Fred W.

Recently I asked Prof Brueggemann for one of his lesser known writings on Justice or Injustice. This request came for a friend who as a non-violent protester at Ft. Benning GA was convicted to serve a six months sentence at a Kentucky Federal Prison. Without hesitation our good professor came up with the single chapter in this little gem of 65 pages! He simply repeated the names of the writers - Sharon Parks and Thomas Groome and their conference on Spirituality in Portland Maine in 1983. His valued contributions are the Preface written in May of 1984 and the first Chapter with the title of \\"Voices of the Night - Against Justice.\\" <br />Since Brueggemann is the Theologian of three writers he sets the stage with the technical issues and background of Micah's tradition among the Old Testament prophets of Justice, Mercy and Compassion. As only our favorite OT Prof can accomplish he makes the case for Micah's program of poetry as a guide for our ways in education. As in his teaching he outlines the texts with headings of Economically, Epistemologically and Linguistically. Along the way he briefly focuses on Torah of Yahweh and the Exodus Memory: \\"Micah offers a vision of the nations submitting to the torah of Yahweh.\\" He relates theology behind textual interpretation with doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God. As one of my Chaplain friends notes, \\"most every exposition of Brueggemann comes out like poetry!\\" He is first and foremost a Poet. <br />I will send my friend this powerful, mediating, spiritual force for supporting those who stand-up for the rights of those who are dis-enfranchised.

Early reading her inspiring exposition...I was taken-up with her explicit combining of the depths of literary and psychological and theological themes discovered in Lamentations!  <br />When she described Lamentations as a short book of five poems, &quot;that expresses with searing clarity their fear, grief, and despair,&quot; I quickly remembered three families of professional friends who were all facing those same personal sufferings. She clearly articulates those issues which most of us faced in CPE! <BR>Her calling the book &quot;an artistic jewel, a theological enigma, and a courageous act of survival&quot;...leads to the rich metaphoric poetry which is able to embrace the sorrows of the world! <br />Her summary begins: &quot;Lamentations is a theological watershed, an in-between place where the old theology of a punishing God no longer holds...&quot; Yet God's voice is largely missing from these poems and is not heard.

Donald Paul Hustad has been the stabilizing force upon many good and gifted Church Musicians. When I first met him with my wife Barbara we were attending the National Conference of Southern Baptist Church Musicians held in Louisville, Ky. Barbara and I slipped up behind him. As she spoke her name quietly in his ear, he jumped and gave her a bear hug. Since he had been her first  piano teacher while serving her Mother's First Methodist Church of Oskaloosa, Iowa, this was the first time we had the chance to renew his friendship.  <br />From 1968 until today we have corresponded, exchanged visits, been gifted with Don's books, compositions, organ recitals and choral conferences for all four churches where we served. When I had time to re-read Jubilate II the title of the Foreword caught my eyes. &quot;The Pilgrimage of a Schizophrenic Musician&quot; became for me the most unexpected and unlikely title he could have chosen! <BR>I doubt that many of his close friends would have chosen that title very fitting for the Donald Hustad who is familiar as the stabilizing and motivating personality who keeps us on an even keel for nearly forty years of turmoil in Church Music! <br />This collectors'gem of an inclusive account of notable changes in Church Worship thru Music has the trademark of the composite Church Musician. Don begins the book before the Foreword with his dedication to Donna, Sondra and Marcia. Not one of us as a Father would risk that personal touch to daughters without being proud of our accomplishments!  <br />Leading with his commitment to Moody Bible Institute and the Billy Graham Team, he moves on to a lengthy tenure as teacher, composer and editor with Southern Seminary and Hope Publishing Co.

Two great books were first printed in 1978: Overhearing the Gospel, by Fred Craddock and The Prophetic Imagination, by Walter Brueggemann. Although it took me 13 years to become familiar with either one, they were both worth the waiting!<br />I cannot remember when I heard Dr. Craddock tell the story of gathering the fallen stars in the backyard of his home and storing them in his Grandma's clothes basket; But this story is placed in poignant conclusion to his first chapter: \\"Concerning Method.\\" Anyone familiar with reading Kierkegaard knows that it requires telling a good story for a parallel metaphor! <br />Unusual as it seems for Craddock, he focuses upon the quote by Kierkegaard: \\"There is a lack of understanding in the land...a something which the one cannot directly communicate to the other.\\" This quote is stated at the beginng of each chapter: Concerning the Listener; Concerning the Teller; Concerning the Story. As only Dr. Craddock can do, the quote is used as a large part of the foundation for each chapter. This does not appear to be true for any other Craddock or Brueggemann book! In chapter 4 on Concerning the Story, Craddock touches the peak with, \\"Stories of Abraham, the Exodus, of Moses, of David...\\" Again quoting Kierkegaard, which is for me a reminder of Brueggemann. Two pages later he refers to S. K. having \\"recaptured beautifully this characteristic of the Bible to make one point at a time, with no anxiety about harmony, balance and symmetry!\\" (Bruegge again.) <br />When he describes the communicators of the Christian faith with words such as intensity, discipline, passion, pathos, he is also reminding me of the ways in which both he and Prof Bruegge communicate.<br />After 40 years since Seminary, I have been searching for such a clearly understandable, thoughtful and inspiring book to motivate preaching.

Since he gives Kathleen O'Connor the credit helping him choose discrete entries that all have interpretative coherence, Prof Bruegge has chosen topics \\"which reflect a focused theological center to his listing.\\" In order to better connect our favorite Professor's preface comments to my personal point of seeing this new Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes alongside some eight other copies of Bruegge's creations, I will relate two other Gems: The Commentary on GENESIS and his definitive later  THEOLOGY Of The OLD TESTAMENT!     On becoming familiar with GENESIS, Interpretation Commentary, I was transported back to his numerous books focused on Psalms. When I stopped over in his classes at Columbia Seminary, I soon  became entranced with his Survey of the Hebrew Bible and his session with THEOLOGY Of the OLD TESTAMENT, his signature work!     Reverberations of Faith has become a specific number of Seven topics which are the more longer from ninety ++ : Deuteronomic Theology, Exodus, Image of God, The Persian Empire, Priestly Tradition, Suffering and Theodicy. In the Image of God he moves from being \\"astonished in the priestly creation narrative of GENESIS\\" to New Testament texts of John 14, Corinthians and Colossians. He lists ten pages of Scripture references with far more from Exodus, Deuteronomy and Psalms!     Not only is Bruegge a first class writer and research artist, he displays his fantastic memory in every class. He continually is moving from one scripture to another with his endless naming of resources for future study of Memorable Themes. From years of multiplied classes, I have discovered the unforgettable example of the consumate teacher! This ranks in the top of his long list of all-inclusive books for layman and scholar.

Eric Haney is a real-life, genuinely caring human being! After  having association with the Rangers and Delta Force personell, I discovered that Eric still makes a personal investment in every human being with whom he comes in contact. No person who comes to speak with him, appears to have any doubt about his realness or genuine spiritual depth. He makes no pretense of having been exposed to every danger imaginable! He gives no 'airs' about his experiences or importance. When you look him in the eyes, you behold the unvarnished Eric Haney. The imprint upon the baseball caps of a few years ago...\\"No Fear!\\" is precisely accurate!    After knowing Eric and Dianna thru the experiences of having a hand in their marriage six years ago, I am convinced of their love for each other, their love of others in their family and their close friends. Yesterday, in their Book-Signing Party at Rocky's Brick Oven, downtown Atlanta, it was totally obvious that they were well-loved and calmly reciprocated that loving to everyone present!     At first reading a few days ago, I thought it may be far beyond my 'taste for light reading.' Surprisingly soon, I arrived into page 25, becoming involved in his Selection Process to becoming a charter member of Delta Force. Lo & behold I'm totally hooked!

Our greatest expectation for the summer is to hear him preach and teach at the Presbyterian Conference on Music and Worship at Montreat. I am deeply indebted to him for his keenly inspired commentary on GENESIS. For two quarters of Preaching Genesis, I have tuned-into his studies in depth to prepare several sermons and hear young students at MERCER/McAFEE School of Theology preach their sermons inspired by Brueggemann.<br />This little gem of a book is the abridged version of The Message of Psalms. In his final chapter of the shorter version, he focuses on God's Justice. There he sites his thesis of three dimensions of 'orientation, disorientation and reorientation:'<BR>* It is pathological to challenge the present order of economic and political power.<BR>* It is pathological to suggest that God may be unjust.<BR>* It is pathological to speak, as some of these psalms do, in a voice of disorientation.<br />Brueggemann inserts 'imprisonment' as one crisis in which the seven psalms of disorientation are best addressed. Here is the one place in all of his books on Psalms where I have read his clearest views on the issue of theodicy. \\"The struggle of the oppressed against the unjust, when cast theologically, is the issue of theodicy.\\" <br />Only recenty in someone's sermon I read that, \\"God prefers the losers in life.\\" While serving as the Chaplain in Georgia's Diagnostic Center, I often wondered if this is not the case for a very few of the choicest and often long-termed inmates. I did often repeat the points of Brueggemann's sermons to the inmates for the Sunday evening sermons. One or two were read back to me by inmates in their rehabilitation group discussions. When I repeated that incident one day in a chance meeting with Prof. Brueggemann, he smiled and replied: \\"Gee, Thanks!\\"<br />Never before as minister, chaplain or teacher have I discovered so many profound yet simple books by one commentator, especially focused upon the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. Thanks and WOW! <BR>Chaplain Fred W. Hood	2002-05-05

Craddock is one consumate preacher of the Gospel and one committed student of the Gospels. Whenever one of his students in the quarterly Monday Morning class at the Cherrylog Christian Church asks about his style, Dr. Craddock says, &quot;I am known as a narrative preacher, but that's not the whole story...&quot; He often follows that with his own definition of &quot;narrative preacher.&quot; For every Monday there are invitations sent to regulars and there will be 30-40 present for the 3 hour session and lunch. <br />His chosen topic usually comes around to his humorous approach into using &quot;inductive methods&quot; and results of opening-up the text into the context of everyday life experiences. When he has come to the point of his lecture for questions, they are asked from every table in the room--often from the mouths of the feminine half of students. His comments and stories are like the gems and jewels from an unopened treasure chest. His creatively authentic and textually authoritative suggestions are received gladly and gratefully. <br />This reprinted treasure becomes a continuing example and stable ingredient for all students of preaching. It is the composite we needed and hoped for, out of his lengthy practice of preaching the Gospel. His footnotes are more numerous than any of his commentaries, such as Luke. He has maintained original footnotes of sources that go back to Thomas de Quincey of 1882. They also include Barth, Bonhoeffer, Bultmann, Ebeling, Max Picard, Alfred North Whitehead, even Igor Stravinsky. What a Scholar! No wonder his teaching has changed the face of preaching! <br />Nobody worth their salt as preacher/teacher should be without! Fred W Hood, Retired Chaplain, Fayetteville, GA (USA)	2001-12-02

Chapter One is remarkable for 81 footnotes, most from Westermann, Wink, Ricoeur, Gunkel, Heschel, Buber and Barth. <br />W.B. favors writing, speaking, thinking in pairs: &quot;creation and Israel, sun and moon, prisoners and widows, loss of certitude and loss of power... On the one hand, the faithful power of God destabilizes, puts us at risk... On the other hand, the faithful power of Yahweh makes new and leaves us with abiding astonishment, healing, forgiven, restored...&quot; <br />Skipping over chapters to Pastoral care in the one he describes, Covenanting as Human Vocation... &quot;distinct from a narrowly based psychology or counseling, means nurturing persons... into a fresh metaphor that holds the possibility of making all things new!&quot; (What a magical wordsmith!)<br />This description of Pastoral care illustrates W.B. as having researched Paul Tillich's Theology as basis for Pastoral Care. He most likely is familiar with the marvelous stories of Fred Craddock, Abraham Heschel and Martin Buber. All of the above are related qualities for good pastoral care. I am so convinced of W.B.'s genius for writing, teaching, thinking, preaching, relating, that I look forward to the possibility of auditing his fall class in the Prophet Jeremiah. <br />Hopefully and Imaginatively, Chaplain Fred W.

Her sermon on the process of Creativity was received gladly by the Preaching Conference of over 600 preachers in National Christian Church of Washington, D.C.  <br />During my second month of digesting comments and sermons by Jana and 11 other distinguished women, I am convinced that other male preachers would also profit greatly from a slow reading. Those sermons which have jumped out as strongest and most creative, alongside of Jana's &quot;A Shameless Path&quot; - based on Luke 11:1-13, are by Teresa L. Fry Brown of Emory-Candler, Barbara Lundblad of Union Seminary, Barbara Brown Taylor and Rabbi Margaret Wenig. <br />Prof. Fry in &quot;A Love Letter Written in Blood&quot; reeks with poetry, music and intimacy of personal imagination. Dr. Lundblad supplies inspiration from her style of sermon birthing to the context of her sermon delivered in the Riverside Church of New York, &quot;After Emmaus.&quot; Never to be under-estimated, Barbara Brown Taylor gives her short sermon, &quot;Bothering God&quot; from Luke 18. Finally, the surprise is from Rabbi Margaret Moers Wenig, the People's Temple in NYC and professor of Homiletics at Hebrew Union College. She moves from &quot;Preaching as Dialogue,&quot; to &quot;Generating Ideas vs. Shaping and Editing the Sermon.&quot; Her sermon is a midrash, or a  commentary on the Torah as story. The unique and lengthy sermon is spiced with phrases and sentences in Hebrew - often 5-6 on each page.

It may require a priest. 2) Healing requires the submission of some thing of value. 3) Healing is the enactment of atonement. 4) The act of putting away the poison of guilt is done not by ourselves but on our behalf by the priest.            <br /> <br />I place this up to, \\"Awed to Heaven, Rooted in Earth; The Psalms of Life and  Faith; Spirituality of the Psalms; Introduction to the Old Testament, Struggling with Scriptures, and Commentary On Jeremiah!\\" It is difficult to place a listing at one perspective of necessity, life-style or precious moments of grief, joy, or pain or peace...Today this is my current list!    <br />   <br />My continuing prayer for all who read his poetic thots, \\"May we be challenged by Sir Walter, one neat OT prophet-poet-preacher.\\" Although his words were created for Yale Lyman Beecher Lectures of 1989, they are proof he is totally at home in both Old & New Testament!

Since his influence spread through the Clinical Pastoral Education Movement, anyone serving as chaplain is on speaking terms with his 40-50 books & hundreds of articles.    In his preface he clearly states his goal: \\"The disciplines of nurturing silence are what this book is about.\\" Dr. Oates keeps his constant theme: \\"discovering your privacy in order to nurture silence is to discover, Ecstasy as an entrancing joy. It means 'to stand outside of oneself or apart from' so that you center down in silence.\\" Then he proceeds to develop those ideas just like he spoke and/or taught in seminary lectures & seminars.    Our beloved mentor, always a gifted, imaginative writer draws upon scripture, stories, poetry, philosophy & nature, exactly as he taught Pastoral Care, Psychology, and Theology.

In the compact approach to Parables in the Gospels, his chief aim is to focus upon the meaning and use of parables... &quot;inherited from Jewish tradition, to understand them in the contexts of the books in which they occur.&quot;<br />From references to Old Testament prophets who used figurative means to make their historical points, such as, Samuel to David, Ezekiel and Hosea to their generations, he moves into the New Testament. From the Synoptic Gospel Parables of Jesus, he slips into John's Parables of Light, Shepherd, Fig tree and the Vine. Next he wanders into the Apocrypha Books of I and II Esdras, Tobit and Ecclesiaticus. Most of his comments from these unique sources come in the chapter on Luke. He uses 50 pages for his discussion of Lucan parables over against fewer pages for those of Matthew and Mark.<br />Thomas Long's approach in his &quot;Preaching the Parables&quot; at Emory-Candler School of Theology is to combine Drury's text alongside those of Father John Donahue and A. J. Hultgren. I discovered that Donahue initiates my interest in the Parable at hand - then Professor Drury continues to develop it without footnotes and fewer references.

Yet I am always on the look-out to discover new approaches and resources for writing sermons and illustrations on the Web-site of a Journal of Homiletics.<br />When I first opened my Christmas book from Westminster John Knox Press, my eyes fell upon the middle chapter. It is given the provocative title of &quot;The Four Pages of the Sermon.&quot; Only quite recently have we arrived at that simple but profound idea!<br />There I first saw the names of famous, great, well-anchored teachers of Preachers: men such as, John Broadus, Fred Craddock, Halford Luccock, Thomas Long, David Buttrick and &quot;more recently Paul Scott Wilson. Being unfamiliar with the last name, I began reading the middle chapter under his theme of homiletic process which connects the length of sermon with four days for writing. <br />The first day's writing for Monday peaked my interest. Wilson and Elliott promoted the checklist of five themes for writing which related to my own underlying motives to create sermons. After reading the two sample sermons by the author, &quot;When God Is Absent&quot; and Wilson's &quot;Calling Off Christmas,&quot; they whetted my appetite for starting at the first chapter.<br />When I entered the first chapter on Narrative Preaching, I was already deeply immersed in the sermons of Fred Craddock. Then I had the opportunity to read another of his fascinating examples of story-telling, &quot;When The Roll Is Called Down Here!&quot; <br />When I saw Dr. Craddock quoted as saying... &quot;Everyone lives inductively...&quot; I was transported back to his numberless preaching conferences. Then Mark Elliott follows Craddock with his successor at EMORY UNIVERSITY, Thomas Long. He quickly appeals to one of his mentors, Edmund Steimle, who &quot;was in the middle of, and to some degree the cause of, a major shift in American preaching.&quot; He proceeds to give us the five steps for any preacher to weave his Narrative sermons. The author notes - &quot;Steimle and Craddock agreed that a sermon should be Low-keyed.&quot;<br />From my lengthy listening, reading and writing of sermons, I was impressed by the scholarly listing of Elliott's resources. He reached back to my early days of introduction to John Broadus' 1944 textbook, &quot;On the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons.&quot; From there he ventured into the influence of Henry Sloan Coffin, Richard Niebuhr, Harry Emmerson Fosdick and landed with Tony Campolo, Samuel Proctor and William Willimon. <br />The examples of Campolo's evangelistic sermon and Proctor's Afro-American sermon became highlights due to my lacking knowledge of their heritage. <br />I found it terribly interesting to peruse the six sermons of out-standing women preachers. From the first Afro-American sermon of Valerie Brown-Troutt, to Leonora Tubbs Tisdale, to Barbara Brown Taylor's final sermon, I was deeply moved! Dr. Brown's shortest sermon, &quot;God's Daring Plan,&quot; and Dr. Tisdale's lengthy &quot;The Gospel We Don't Want To Hear OR To Preach&quot; were imaginative and greatly inspired. The reason for such emphasis on Old Teastament texts must be due to the influence of Walter Brueggemann. Those two sermons came across as profoundly thought-provoking. They were all quite consuming to this crusty old connoisseur of great preaching.  <br />I whole-heartedly recommend this little jewel of a handbook on Creative Styles of Preaching. You may be surprised!	2001-01-22

I am always on the look-out for new approaches and resources for writing new sermons on the Lectionary Texts. <br />When I opened this book my eyes fell on his middle chapter, it is entitled The Four Pages of the Sermon. There I saw the names of pivotally well-anchored men as, John Broadus, Fred Craddock, Halford Luccock, Thomas Long, David Buttrick, and &quot;more recently  Paul Scott Wilson.&quot; Not knowing the name of Wilson, I read this chapter first of all... The homiletic process touches on the length of sermon connected with the days of writing. <br />The writing for getting started on Monday peaked my interest! His checklist did catch-hold of my own underlying motives for writing sermons. I liked Thursday's tough themes where we tend to misplace the good news of God's action in the biblical text. The two model sermons of &quot;When God Is Absent&quot; - the only one written by Pastor Elliot and &quot;Calling Off Christmas&quot; by Paul Scott Wilson are both personal, interesting and well-written. <br />After being introduced into the heart of Mark Elliott's text, I began reading in-earnest to see how many of his resources I had already read and how they were related to his themes of Creative Styles of Preaching. The first chapter on Narrative Peaching, I was already deeply exposed to Fred Craddock and greatly love his  fascinating example of &quot;When the Roll is Called Down Here.&quot; I have long admired his creative sermons and his inspired teaching.<br />When I saw Dr. Craddock quoted as &quot;Everyone lives inductively... I was transported back to his numberless conferences on Styles of Preaching. Then Mark Elliott follows Fred Craddock with his successor at EMORY UNIVERSITY, Thomas Long. He appeals to those stories of Edmund Steimle, who &quot;was in the middle of, and to some degree was the cause of, a major shift in American preaching.&quot; Then he proceeds to give us the five steps for any preacher to weave his narrative sermons. He notes that Steimle and Craddock agreeed that a sermon should be &quot;low keyed...&quot;<br />For my lengthy interest of listening, reading and presently the writing of sermons, I was most impressed by the scholarly list of Elliott's resources. He reached back into my early days of being introduced to John Broadus' 1944 Textbook, &quot;On the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons.&quot; From there he ventures into the great influence of Henry Sloan Coffin, Richard Niebuhr, Harry Emerson Fosdick, right up to Tony Campolo and William Willimon. <br />Two samples of Tony Campolo's Evangelistic preaching and Samuel Proctor's Afro-American became highlights for my lack of knowing their inspired styles of delivery. <br />I found it terribly interesting to peruse the six sermons of these outstanding women preachers. From the first African American sermon of Valerie Brown-Trout, to Leonora Tubbs Tisdale - to Barbara Brown Taylor's final sermon - they were imaginative and inspired greatly from Old Testament texts. That possibly stems from the great influence of Walter Brueggemann's teaching and emphasis of the older inspired texts. Barbara Brown Taylor is my favorite with her compelling, dramatic, shortest example! But the longest sermon by Dr. Tisdale comes-across as profoundly thought provoking! They were all quite consuming for this crusty old connoisseur of great preaching. <br />I recommend this little handbook of Creative Styles of Preaching wholeheartedly and with promises for some surprises to the other lovers of good preaching.	2001-01-22
