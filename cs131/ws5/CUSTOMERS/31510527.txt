Lisette Paul came upon the disappearance of the Emerald Buddha very suddenly. With the help of a few new found friends and bustling city, Lisette figures out the Buddha's puzzling disappearance. I liked this book a lot. It was very descriptive. I felt like I was there and could feel and see everything. It also included a lot of truth and real facts about the palace. It combined facts, fiction and mystery all together. Just when you think it's all over, it gets even more intense. <BR>Compared to other books, I like this one a lot more than even science fiction, which few books I've read even close to being like this were. On a scale of 1-10 stars, I give this book 8 stars.	2003-05-14

In this book a young lady goes to her ant and uncles house.  She is going there because her uncle is a famous writer and she wants her advise on her short stories.  After she gets there she learns that he is having guests at the house that weekend, and they have to figure out where he has put a manuscript.  In this manuscript he has something about every one of the people staying in the house that weekend except Sam because he didn't know that she was going to be there.  Who ever found out where the manuscript was would have all the information taken out of the manuscript before it was published.  While everyone was looking for the manuscript, putting the clues that they had been given and everything, Augustus Trevor was murdered.  They were supposed to be working together but she devised a clue that would get all the other players in the wine cellar.  In the end Sam figures out where the manuscript is and who murdered Augustus Trevor.  I thought this book was ok.  It isn't the best book I have ever read but it made you keep reading and never put the book down, and it made you wonder what was going to happen next.  I give this book three (3) out of five (5) stars!	2003-04-30

Janie turned the house into an apartment to rent out to old people. A sniper was after all of the people in the house and wanted to kill them all.<BR> I liked this book because it was twisted and it was hard to find out who the murderer was.

She later finds out that more than half of the children are gone and they are going to a place called Playland.<br />  I liked this book a lot since I thought most of the clues were different and more clever than other types of mysteries. The book was also easy to read for me which makes the book a lot better.<br />  I don't usually read a lot of mysteries , but compared to the ones I did read this book is just as good. I would give this book a 5 out of 5, or 5 stars in this case.	2003-04-30

In the beginning, John Shaw takes a job from a company called Airflo. He has to fly to San Francisco and pick up a brand new private aircraft and then fly it back to England. The only catch is Sidney Lennox wants John to pick up a passenger in San Francisco. John also needs to take a package along with him, which is supposed to contain car parts. What is really in the package ends up giving John a lot of trouble once in San Francisco. People attempt to kill him, kidnap him, and his passenger ends up being a murderer! The story also had many twists and turns, making it interesting despite its flaws.<br /> Overall, I thought this book was okay. In the beginning the book is kind of dry and boring, but it picks up about half way through. I thought the book was very confusing, though. Along with all of the twists and turns, the author doesn't make it very clear what's going on all the time, so I had to read some parts over several times. The book is very interesting, though. Once everything came together for me I found that reading the book was worth it just for the satisfaction of finding some of the subtle clues scattered throughout the story. Even thought they add confusion, the twists and turns make the story great. They keep you guessing by clearing up the old suspects and sometimes bringing them back. I suggest this book to fans of the mystery genre because it keeps you guessing even after you finish reading the last page.	2003-04-30

With a little Columbo style detective work, Eddie, Jack, and Eddie's sister Julie work together to get the facts about was at Grizzly Creek Marina Resort nine years ago.  They use the facts to find out who could've dumped a body in the lake.<br /> I personally liked this book but I was kind of disappointed at the same time.  My disappointment came when the author left out gory details when talking about the bank robbery and when Eddie and Jack find the skeleton in the lake.  So if you can do without too many details, you'll like this book.	2003-04-30

Laura is out to find her brothers murderer no matter what. <BR> This book is a four star book.  The part I liked the most was it starts out with action in the first chapter and you don't have to wait until the third or fourth chapter for action.  Also this author really has a great detail and it helps you visualize what she is saying.  This book also relates to what is going on in the world at this time.  It gives you a feeling of what the families attacked by terrorist might go through, and how things might turn out.  It is very action packed with excitement in every page.	2003-04-30

Also, in the beginning I didn't understand how Mr.Orlop knew Emma, and Kim, because just out of the blue he told Kim that her mother and Ms. Davis had something in common that was very important.

First, Pa, a long-distance truck driver, reported that his load of TVs had been stolen.  Then, Pa and Ma had a fight and Pa left, and they thought nothing worse could come but it did.

Finally, Rick, Kenny, and their friends, Connie and Julie, went looking for their mom.<BR> I liked this book for many different reasons.  I liked this book because it was very interesting, and it always left me wanting to read more.  Like the time when ma was outside talking to a man, and the next thing Rick and Kenny knew she was gone.  She had disappeared, and they waited for hours and hours but she didn't come home.  This book was very interesting and also funny.  I also like the fact that they kept hearing and seeing things in the dark, abandoned, amusement park.

The way the author (Constance Leonard) went on and on about the setting and such boring things, I wanted to stop reading the book and return it back to the school library. The book never had me interested. I would rather have read Harry Potter since this book never had me interested. Once the book ended I was upset because I didn't want it to end. But I would be very anxious for the next book to be released. The book I read The Marina Mystery was very boring. I wouldn't recommend it to any one.	2003-04-22

On the other end a stranger whispers, Your brother is dead. She later finds her brother Jeremy is in a coma at the hospital and may never recover. She feels alone and has to suspect that even her new boyfriend, Del, is a suspect. She has courage and bravery in finding out who did this to her brother. Her parents dont support her very well in doing so. Her father is a work-a-holic and her mother is always drinking to forget her problems. She finds that not even her parents seem too concerned about the incident.<br />I give this book a 3 on a rating of zero to five. Its not horrible and its not fantastic. The problem with it is that the beginning is extremely boring. There isnt much action at all, and all through the book its pretty slow moving. Even with the lack of actions it gets very good at some points. Fortunately, the book gets a better pace near the middle of the book. <br />Another problem was that the author was not too descriptive. She didnt get her descriptions to make the book better. I dont enjoy mysteries all that much unless its a fantastic book, which this is definitely not. This book was well written, if you dont include the failure of descriptive words and the lack of excitement at times. I feel that Nixon left the most important part of the story, the ending, in the dust. It was just way too sudden and not suspenseful. Also, the author gave away too much information about the characters too early in the story. This book does not have a stead pace and it is hard to understand unless you are really interested and can pay complete attention to it. Compared to other books it is fairly easy to read and comprehend at an 8th grade reading level.	2003-04-22

Carrie has a pretty normal life, but her mother was never the best influence on her, and when Carrie was younger, her mother had been a horrible alcoholic.  One day Martha, Carries mom, leaves a note saying that she had gone to the movies, but she never returned.   At first, everyone seems to care about Martha's disappearance, but as more and more time goes by Carrie's friends and family start to accept that Martha just decided to up and leave her family.  It seems like only Carrie thinks that something bad has happened to her mom.  Carrie devotes herself to finding out what happened to Martha with the assistance of her neighbor Allen who obviously knows something about the whereabouts of Martha but is to scared to tell anyone. <br /> This book was overall pretty good, but the beginning was a little slow and boring.  Towards the end of the book, the plot thinkens and becomes very exciting.  I would suggest this book to you if you liked other missing person books like the Face on the Milk Carton.	2003-04-22

They tell each other everything, and hang out all the time. Suzy thinks some one is shadowing her. When Alexis mentions it to her parents, and her mom later talks about moving to the house she inherited Alexis gets worried. She continues to see the guy at the park and at restaurants. He asks questions to her friends, and her little brother she always has to look after. Alexis gets scared, and doesn't know what to do, so she decides she'll talk to him the next time she sees him, and ask him what he wants. So sure enough, the next time she saw him she did just that. What she found out changes her whole life!<BR>Read the book to find out what Alexis found out.<BR> <BR>I give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because it had some intense parts in it, and it kept you wondering and wanting to read more. Some parts of the book were kind of dull and boring. They didn't have too much to do with how the whole thing turns out in the end, but it gave you more information about the relationships that Alexis had with everyone around her. Some of the things going on in her family while the mystery is happening relates to a lot of kids and by reading this it can give some kids hope that their parents will get back together if they are divorced. Also, that something adventurous might happen in their lives. Compared to other books this one could have been better if they had more going on during the mystery, and didn't explain things over and over again. But all in all, it was an alright book.	2003-04-22

This story is about Gwenda and Giles Reed, and a woman named Miss Marple.  Together, they uncovered an unrecognized and unreported mystery, the murder of Helen Halliday (Gwenda's dead stepmother).  Gwenda and Giles are determined to solve the mystery while going against Miss Marple's advice to let a sleeping murder lie.  They set off to find out who did it while getting clues from people who knew Helen Halliday and Kelvin Halliday (Gwenda's father) when they were alive.<BR>     I thought this book was excellent.  Agatha Christie is now my second favorite author.  Sleeping Murder was so good that I couldn't put it down and I read it in one night!  Agatha Christie keeps it interesting throughout the book, so there aren't any boring parts.  I thought she did a really good job describing the book too.  Like \\"Mrs. Mountford's back parlour was a comfortable room.  It had a round table covered with cloth, and some old-fashioned armchairs and a stern-looking, but unexpectedly well-sprung sofa against the wall.  There were china dogs and other ornaments on the mantelpiece, and a framed coloured representation of the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose.\\"  You can just picture that scene in your head.  My favorite part of the book was in Chapter 24 Scene 2, where Dr. Kennedy tries to murder her.  When I was reading that part of the book, I was zoned out because I was just so kept up in suspense.  I'd rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars because this is an excellent book and if you like really captivating books, I would highly recommend it for you to read.	2003-04-22

In honor of Fred Oren builds a community ballpark called Fred Lighthouse Memorial Field.  Later in the book Oren finds a much-needed clue at Mama and Jack's wedding.  I did not really like this book all that much, so I gave it 3  stars out of 10.  The reason I liked the book was because it involved a murder.  Murders, crimes, and the investigation leading up to the finding of who committed the crime intrigues me.  The reason I did not like this book was because I did not like the way the investigation took place, it involved teenagers performing their own investigation after the police gave up on the murder case.  I don't know about you but, I think teenagers investigating a murder seems pretty corny to me and to add the cherry on top, they find out who the murderer was.  This book does not compare to any others because I have never read a book as horrible as this one.	2003-04-22

Kristi has never met him before but a folder was found in his house full of pictures and awards about Kristi.  Another problem is that someone is trying to kill Mr. Merson, and Kristi also finds out that Mr. Merson is doing something illegal.<BR> I really liked this book.  It was a mystery, and I thought it has a good plot.  I also liked this book because it makes you want to keep reading.  The end of every chapter tells you about something exciting thats going to happen.  I dont think this book would be a very common mystery because you dont hear of a plot like this very often.  I also think other Joan Lowery Nixon mysteries would be interesting.	2003-04-22
