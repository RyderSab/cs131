Frances Slocum is a small child of four or five when she is captured by Lenape Indians near the Fort of Wilkes Barre.  Frances quickly adapts to her new life and is admired by her adoptive family for her red heart.  As she grows to be a woman the struggles of Native American life become her own. The constant battle for survival against the encroaching white settlers and the soldiers they bring.  Over 60 years of her life are covered in this tale of historical fiction. <br />What I found so endearing was the love shown to her by her  adoptive family and the continual unending love of her biological family as they search for their beloved Frances for sixty years. <br />This story seems to be well researched and I am going to try to find out more about Frances Slocum.  <br />Mr. Thom once again has written an incredible tale.	2005-09-21

I have loved all the stories in the Song of Acadia and I hope that there are more to come. I completed the reading of this story in only three days.  Once started it is almost impossible to put down. <br />This story is the continuation of Louise and Catherine's story which started in The Meeting Place and the lives of their daughters Anne and Nicole. At the end of this book the two families find that are bound more closely together in a way  they could only imagine.   <br />However, there may be a mistake in the story line.  As another reviewer mentioned, I remember Louise's mother leaving Acadia in The Meeting Place with her family.  My memory may be wrong;but, never the less it is still a great story.  <br />Once again the fervrent love of God and his will among our lives through prayer and His answers is the cornerstone of this story. <br />A wonderful story.  One you will not want to miss.	2005-04-28

Riona is the next book in the Fires of Gleannmara with Maire being the first in the series.  <br />  <br />Oh to have a faith so pure and tireless as Riona's. <br /> <br />Kierran is the Gleannmara heir.  He has abandoned his faith in the one true God because he feels that God has abandoned him. He has loved Riona since childhood and has promised to her dying brother to care for her forever.  Although he loves Riona he is uncertain about accepting the God she loves. <br />Riona thinks only on Kierran as a brother and has no romantic feelings toward him.   <br /> <br />Events force Riona and Kierran and their entourage on a dangerous journey that will change each others lives and those that they love for ever. <br /> <br />Once again I find myself longing for the spirituality and discipline of religion in the early Christian church in Ireland. <br />Truly they saw God in everything. <br /> <br />I am not one to reread books that I have already read, but I feel that I may make an exception with this series.  I want these books on my book shelf all the time.  <br /> <br />Reading Maire first is not necessary.  If you have not read Maire I am certain that you will after you read Riona. <br /> <br />Looking forward to the next book in the series.	2004-07-28

Wonderful tale of the religion of the &quot;One True God&quot; and its early development in Ireland.  As I read this book I found myself longing to be a part of the faithful people of Erin when Christianity was taking hold of its people.  These people were so devout in their religion, it made me realize how much we have back slided with Christianity. <br />Maire is engaging.  She is an empowered woman seeking what is best for her people even if it means marrying a Christian hostage from another land.  Witness the sparks of faith in Maire and the people of Gleannmara as she falls in love with Rowan and his God.

Angela Hunt does a wonderful job telling the story of the first English colony in America. This is great historical christian fiction.  I especially liked how she integrated the Native Americans and the English into one thriving community.  Also of interest to me was the idea of some of the colonists attempt to return to England after many many years of being left to fend for themselves.  <BR>The main characters in this story are Jocelyn and Thomas.  Thomas is a Protestant minister seeking a new life in a new land and Jocelyn, the cousin of Eleanor Dare, seeking escape from the grief of the death of her beloved father.  Unbeknownst to Jocelyn her uncle has secretly arranged for Rev. Thomas to marry her or he must become her Uncle's indentured servant.<BR>The relationship between Jocelyn and Thomas was very frustrating to me. I kept wanting and expecting them to have the deeply expressive love that Jocelyn so longingly desires, but never really attains until the end of the story when their world becomes torn apart.<BR>I have been intrigued by the Roanoke Colony and Virginia Dare since in middle school and this story to me is a truly believable concept to the ultimate demise of the Roanoke colony.<BR>I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series with great anticipation.	2004-01-21

This wonderful book written by Mary Pope Osbourne puts memaids into a different light.  Most of us (I think) view mermaids as fantastically beautiful kind and caring creatures. Although most of the mermaids in this book are depicted as being beautiful they can be very scarey as well.  My daughter who will soon be eight described this book as, \\"Neat, but a little scarey.\\"  It was very interesting to read the stories from different countries.  These mermaids are very different than the one portrayed in the Disney film.  It is refreshing to read about mermaids in a cultural interpretation. <BR>If you are a mermaid fan you will enjoy this book.	2003-12-29

You will relate to Marty's struggle as he decides whether to do what is legally correct or to do that which is ethically correct in deciding the future of the beagle he has named Shiloh.<br />As a native West Virginian this book struck a cord of familiarity as I read about cities that are familiar to me. Also the issue of poverty, which sadly  every West Virginian is aware of as West Virginia has one of the highest poverty levels in the United States.<br />It is truly a gem.  I hope the schools in West Virginia are using this wonderful book  as part of their curriculum.	2003-11-22

This is only the second Magic Tree House Book we have read but the books in the series are quickly becoming my soon to be second graders favorite books to read.<br />The story is really about the Irish monks and the contributions they made to civilization during the Dark Ages.  The Vikings are raiding Ireland.  <br />I was pleasantly surprised of the authors mention of Christians and use of God in a blessing by one of the monks.  When we borrowed this book from the library we thought it was all about the Vikings.  The Christian monks were a wonderful bonus.<br />This book will appeal to your school age childs sense of adventure and they will learn something about history without even realizing it.

This is the first Brother Cadfael mystery that I have read.  In the past I have enjoyed the Brother Cadfael Mysteries on PBS and that is what prompted me to read one for myself.<br />The language is difficult to understand at times, (I suggest keeping a dictionary handy)but the mystery is a masterful \\"who done it\\".  In this story the husband of a former love of Cadfaels suddenly dies and it is discovered that the victim was poisoned by the deadly Monk's Hood.  The same tincture that Brother Cadfael himself has prepared for medicinal purposes.  There is a large cast of characters that may have purpose and reason to murder Gervase Bonel but when the authorities believe the murderer to be his young stepson Brother Cadfael takes matters into his own hands to prove the youth innocent.<br />This is not a light read.  Stick with it.  You will enjoy it.	2003-07-28

My seven year old daughter and I finished this book last night.  She was very sad to have it end.  What a wonderful account of the devastating storm that hit the islands of Assateague and Chincoteague and the relief efforts to rebuild the islands and the devastated wild pony population.<br />It was very heartwarming to read in the epilogue excerpts from actual letters of children that sent in their hard earned money to buy back the ponies sold at previous Pony Penning Days to replenish the wild herds of Assateugue.  These children and others like them preserved a tradition that had been maintained for over 100 years and because of them continues on today.  In fact, Marguerite Henry dedicated this book to those very children that made it all possible.<br />Marguerite Henry does an excellent job of using local dialect in the telling of the story, especially with Grandpa and Grandma.  You can not help but become involved in the characters and their concerns become very real to you.  <br />I read this book many many years ago and had forgotten a great deal of the story. One of the things I did remember was Misty being put in Grandma's kitchen to wait out the storm.<br />If you are like me and read this book many years ago I encourage to reread it. You will be glad you did.	2003-05-29

In this tale two children brought up with pagan ideals fall in love and proclaim Jesus Christ as their Lord and savior.  This union brings forth the child Merlin.  And so the epic story continues.  The story is very mystical in nature and exciting.<BR>I gave this a 4 star rating because in the begining for several chapters it goes back and forth between Atlantis and Britian jumping from one story line to the other.  Once the two stories become one it picks up incredibly.  <BR>I am greatly looking forward to reading the next book in the saga.	2003-04-30

The treatment of the Irish people by the English is deplorable.  I was surprised that as the people of Ireland are starving ships are being sent to England full of grain and livestock to feed the English.  Always new that the famine was horrible to Ireland but now I know the whole history of why it was so horrible.<br />I think I now have some insight as to why my Great-great-grandparents came to America.<br />As you read the books in the Galway chronicle you feel like you are witnessing first hand their joys and sorrows and their steadfast faith in God.	2003-03-24

AT first I thought that some pages were missing but this was not the case.<BR>Also, the introduction at the begining made it seem like Fuzzheads are real creatures.<BR>Stellaluna and Verdi are much better and truly can not compare to this book.<BR>I have three other books by the author and am glad I borrowed this from the library first.	2002-08-05

This book is great way for parents and children to work together<BR>at learning to read.  My daughter is going into the first grade in the fall and is actively learning to read.  This was great practice for what she has learned with phonics.  Plus it was great fun for both of us. <BR>  Proper sentence construction and reading comprehension are also intertwined in this book.<BR>  The stickers are fun way to enhance the learning experience.<BR>  This book goes along with the Blue's Clues ABC's episode;but, you do not need it to thoroughly enjoy this book.  <BR>  I would love to find other books along the same idea to further enhance my daughter's learning experience.	2002-07-29

After waiting 12 years or more for this book I was very disappointed!!!  <BR>The story is repetitive at times.  Also,  there is too much attention to detail.  I think Ms. Auel spent too much time writing this book.  I found myself skimming over the descriptions to get back to the story.<BR>Too many new character introductions, some of which have detailed story lines and then are never mentioned again.<BR>I have loved all of Jane Auel's other books and hope that the next book in the Children of the Earth series is more like her other books.<BR>I usually abhor abridged books but think that in this case it might be a better choice. <BR>If you do not have the other books in the sereis borrow it from the library or from someone that already has it.	2002-06-17

I was looking for a book that she would be interested in enough that she would try to read it herself and I found it in this book.  She loves Balto and that has helped her spark her interest in reading this book.  She needs some help with some of the words but isn't discouraged.<BR>We are going to try to find the statue of Balto in Central Park mentioned in the book when go to New York City next week.	2002-06-17

As a West Virginia resident and one that lives near the Ohio river, I find myself thinking about Mary and her journey home.  I find myself wondering what the river looked like to her.  This is a fantastic book.  I have passed this book on to several people and they all tell me that they can not put it down.<BR>If you read this book you will find yourself asking, &quot;what is going to happen next&quot;. <BR> What is so remarkable is that this is a true story.  I found myself crying when Mary left her newborn baby behind.  The perils she and Gretel endure are unbelievable.  I would hope that I would be able to persevere as she did in such trying times. I don't think a man could have done any better.<BR> West Virginia history classes need to teach about this wonderful women and not focus so much on learning the counties.  I could not believe that this story takes place in our beautiful state and had never even heard of this woman.<BR> The Hallmark channel showed a TV movie based on the book but played lightly on the hardships and was not a true adaptation of the book.	2002-04-25

This book makes you ask yourself, &quot;If what is happening in this story really happened where would I be in my faith walk?&quot;  Very perplexing.  Well written.  Would recommend this to everyone.<br />I gave the rating of 4 stars because I feel the love interest was not essential to the story and at times detracted from the story.

The story line is very believable and unpredictable.  I must say that all the books in the series are great and once started are almost impossible to put down.  I am excited that another book in the series is coming out in the fall of 2002. <BR> As the other reviewer mentioned, I too would like more involvement of the Acadian parents.	2002-04-12

After visiting Disney World last year my 4 year old daughter kept after me to retell the story of Brer Rabbit and the tar baby, I was so pleased to find this book with its great illustrations. When we read this book before bed we just can't read one.  My daughter likes all the stories not just the Tar Baby and the poster is great too.	2001-03-08

What a wonderful story.  I  especially enjoyed how the women's prayer life and daily bible readings  became a very special and important part of their friendship as well as  there marriage.  The story does start out slow, but once through the first  two chapters it was hard to put down.  I can't wait to read the sequel.	2000-08-16
