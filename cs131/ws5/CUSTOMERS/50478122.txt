The end is a believable well done shocker. Poirot and his seemingly off the wall questions to the suspects make so much sense when he explains them at the end. Having read much of the Lady Dame's work I must say that this is an excellent addition to her mysteries. I believe that Christies novels read best in one sitting because of the dialouge centered writing but,it always makes me a little sad at the end knowing that I am running out of titles by her.	2002-11-13

Revenge is our hero's motivating factor in this spy thriller.<BR>Gabriel Allon, is drawn out of the reclusive retirement of art restorer, to track down the man who is responsible for his sons death. Tariq is our antagonist and he is one cold fish. His two goals in life are to destroy the palestinian/isreali peace process and kill Gabrial Allon. Throw in you standard gorgeous fashion model who happens to be an agent of Mossad's special \\"OFFICE\\" and I do belive we have an outstanding thriller. Bodies are left in the wake when Gabrial Allon is involved. Tariq and his extensive resume of death by assassination battles with a plan that fools us all, just keep your head down and enjoy an outstanding read.	2002-04-12

Reich writes 3 dimensional characters, No one all good or all bad. Our hero Devlin Judge is very honorable but not beyond breaking a few rules to catch the fugitive SS baddie Erich Seyss.<BR>By the way, Seyss is one bad dude but, still quite human and at times almost symathetic. ALMOST. Action galore with real life historical figures like Patton, &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donavon, Klaus Barbie,&amp; IKE just add to the spark this novel is charged with.	2002-01-17

I am a big Clancy fan but through the years he has become overly descriptive and long-winded. This was early in his career and he hadn't reached that point yet. This is a classic COLD WAR espionage thriller. The characters are wonderfully written and the action is described with real drama and panache. Check it out and at the very least get chills from the CIA operatives working with the Afghan freedom fighter &quot;The Archer&quot;. Yes we helped them fight the Russians. The Russian spy &quot;Cardinal&quot; is an excellent character very realistically written.<BR>Crack this one and enjoy a masterpiece of the genre.	2002-01-08

This may be the best first chapter I have ever read in any genre. And believe it or not it only gets better from there. I believe most of Ms. Christies titles should be read in one sitting to fully appreciate the interaction between her characters. &quot;DEATH IN THE CLOUDS&quot; is a wonder because of the suttle way Poirot asks seemingly harmless questions of suspects and observes the small signs which give them away. True he always does this, but in this one it is truly some of his best detective work ever.	2001-08-24

Disregard the negative reviews written previously, this is vintage Christie when she was at a peak. Miss Marple and her ability to spot when people are lying, once again save the police from making the obvious error. Basically she doesn't believe anyone and begins to weed the facts thus. And I DO NOT OVER EMPHASIZE that the many suspects tell many lies in attempt to cover up anything that may humilate them. Fascinating study of human character.	2001-07-26

That is why she was and still remains the best of the genre. This is our intro to Miss Marple and her amatuer sluething. The best thing you can say about any mystery writer is her/his solutions are well hidden yet, totally believable when they are revealed. That fits this story to a tee. The story is narrated by the vicar who is not only unlucky enough to have a murder commited in his home but, is also one of the main suspects. Tough day for anyone unless your next door neighbor is MISS MARPLE. Buy this and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.	2001-07-23

Slueth extrodinaire Poirot makes an unusally late appearance but, this serves to only highten his effectiveness and our interest. Ms. Christie's masteries include the ability to make us like and even care about characters in as little as 2 or 3 sentences. By doing this she clouds our judgement on motive, deception, and the ability to deduce what only becomes obvious after another classic Poirot confrontations with the suspects. This is one Christie's best &quot;later&quot; works.	2001-07-13

Sir Harry's self bashing is a laugh riot as he explains to us his misadventures during this understudied part of Victorian history. Mr. Fraser's historical knowledge is  impressive. We must thank him for using one of the funniest characters in all literature to explain events of great historical signifigance.

It can't be easy to write about a vicious vigalante with a heart of gold, but it is done in convincing fashion here. Batman will do anything to stop mob boss &quot;The Roman&quot; and a serial killer killing his henchmen in a corrupt Gotham yet, he has a tender spot for not only &quot;Catwoman&quot; but, for &quot;Solomon Grundy born on a Monday&quot;. It is this dual persona that humanizes our hero and has made him the social icon he has been for over 60 years. You see nobody is all good or all bad and we have all thought of revenge and selfless giving at nearly the same instant. Many novel writers could study the Batman/Bruce Wayne character to learn a thing or two about character development. This is the most impressive graphic novel I have ever seen.	2001-02-19

This is a great yarn that I completed in one sitting.Our protagonist is not only a great detective but, a likable man. He is an attractive character for all the usual reasons, (i.e...intellegence,charm,loyalty,persistance,..et al.), yet it is his human flaws that allowed me to care about him and understand him.They include smoking too much, drinking to escape feelings at times, and a wandering eye for the ladies.(DON'T BASH HIM TOO HARD FOR THE LAST ONE BECAUSE IT IS ONLY HIS EYE THAT WANDERS.) So much so in fact the author must have studied psychology at length. The author's knowledge of police procedures including, forensics, stake-outs, and questioning of witnesses and suspects, is absolutely dead-on perfect. This one really kept me guessing. Kudos to Mr. Robinson for making the series of crimes  and the solving thereof so realistic.	2001-01-06

Flashman may be fictional but, he is a real hero. He isn't doing it for queen and country though, he's in it for a quick buck and a roll in the hay with a maiden or two, or three... Written in memoir form it is not the usual autobiographcal self-glorification you would expect. No one is more critical of him than Flash, himself. He's a self serving coward and proud of it. A hero by default, Harry tells it warts and all. Booze, broads, and stealing the crown jewels. Anytime you think he has escaped unscathed he blunders into an even bigger mess. I promise you will enjoy this.	2000-10-22

The depth of Gerard's character rivals even the great Sherlock Holmes. Just as with his more famous counterpart(Holmes), Gerard is not just a hero(although there can be no questioning his bravery),he can also be a clown,(without ever realizing it)a ladies man, the greatest swordsman in the Grande' Armee(or at least so he tells us). With exciting short stories we venture through Gerard's career as a cavalry officer. He quite often bumbles his way into situations an officer of his rank should never allow himself into yet, it is these situations once gotten out of(after much daring and a little bit of luck)that build not only his career but, the readers passion for his character.  These stories are an excellent companion to the more famous Sherlock Holmes stories. Where have all the writers with skills like Doyle's gone?	2000-10-11

It reads like a novel, but as they say &quot;truth is stranger than fiction.&quot; Ms. Tuchman has written THE historical masterpiece on the beginnings of what has to be the most confusing conflict in history. World War I will shake the ruling classes foundations to the ground. Monarchies will no longer reign supreme in its aftermath, communism gains a foothold it will not relinquish for 80 years, England bleeds herself white, France never is a world power of magnitude again, but why?.... This book explains how the worlds most powerful industrial societies allowed everthing they held dear to be destroyed. This book doesn't take sides, it explains why the sides began the war juggernaut a rolling. In detail, with passion, and in a moving manner. This war more than any other can be directly attributed to arms proliferation and a diplomatic status quo. The diplomats from all sides fumble and it kills millions. The generals use 19th century assault tactics in the face of 20th century firepower. In five weeks time, which the author has descibed perfectly, step-by-step, the western world begins and cannot stop the &quot;War to End All Wars&quot; Ms. Tuchman may no longer be with us but this book will make her immortal.	2000-09-18
