The writing was wonderful, it was a page turner, and it kept me up all night because I did not want to put it down, however, I felt at time that I knew what was going to happen, and I was always right. <br />In most cases that would annoy me, but Palmer is such a great artist, and writes in a way that keeps the reader glued to the book, that I did not care that I knew what was about to happen. <br />A great, great read!	2005-09-11

The book was boring, slow, and full of a alot of WRONG info. <br />- The section on episiotomys is not factual. I have the updated version of this book, so there is no reason for it to have such old information. It has been proven that episiotomys are needed in only extreme cases when a baby needs to get out right away. This section in this boosk makes them out to be the norm, and says very little about the importance of natural tears. <br />Not only does it heal better, faster and more natrually, but your body knows how much to tear in order to get the baby out. Often times a doctor will cut you too much..meaning you have more to heal, or they don't cut long enough..and then you end up tearing ontop of the cut.  <br /> <br />-Dr. Gillespie is not very accepting of homebirth's, and he fails to mention that the the 20% of normal pregnancis that have 'births gone bad' are caused by hospital interventions. He also seems to think that the reason home births are popular in other countries is because women can't afford to go to a hospital. Nice try doc. Could it be that other countires are just smarter? Yep! <br /> He also forgets to mention that the home birth popular countries have a much higher 'live brth' rate compared to the united States. <br />I am not against hospitla births. I have had one myself..as well as a homebirth. It seems to me though that the doc is only putting his personal opinion rather than fact and helpful info. <br /> <br />He only mentions midwives in passing which is very unfair to women who will read only this pregnancy book. He does very little to empower women and makes pregnancy into a big medical mishap, that only doctors can be a part of.  <br /> <br />He does not get into delivery except to talk a lot of nonsence. FOr instance. His only mentino of position during delivery is a short blurb about where squatting, and hands and knees adapted from. <br /> <br />Not a book for a smart women who actually wants to learn factual information and how to have a wonderful pregnancy and birth. My fear is that some young girl will pic up this book, believe what it says and then make all the wrong choices (although the author believes any and all choices during pregnancy and birth are the dr.'s and not the mothers). I hope most women are smarter than that though <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-12

I coudl not wait to find out what was going to happen next. I'm never dissapointed with the endings of her book. She always seems to give the reader what we wants, but is good enough not to make it all predictable! <br /> <br />I like how she casually mentions people from her other novels. In this one she mentioned Kris Pheonex a few times in passing. She makes her writting seem so real when she does that. <br /> <br />In this book, Lola Sanchez is a hot latino actress who is the 'it girl' of the moment. She loves teh wild life and can't seem to decided who wants she wants to be with. Her story ends in a not so 'happy ending' fashion. <br /> <br />Shelbey Chensey is an English actress who is married to 40 something actor who is the same league as Tom Cruis. Everyone wants him..on set and off. His addiction to booze, drugs and women makes it very hard to have a happy marriage, and SHelby doens't want to put up with it anymore! <br /> <br />Cat (forget her last name, osrry) is a new screen writter/director who has landed her first totally funded film deal. We don;t get to see much of her cheating husband in the novel, but the marriage does end (Please, don;t scream about spoiler..the book IS called Hollywood DIVORCES ya know!!) I think I liek Cat better than any of the other players in the book. SHe is smart, witty and makes me laugh. <br /> <br />Gret abook. Wish I coudl give it more than 5 stars!	2005-05-10

I really have a problem with the control aspect of this type of parenting. Time outs and seclusion are not an OK thing to do when it comes to my children. <BR>The whole 'Thats one..' (supposed to stop bad behavior in it's track thing..well, it's bull) So we basically give our kids three chances, and then we punish them by sending them away to 'think about'. <BR>In the 'how to use this book' section it tells you that if the child tries to leave the room or doesn't;t want to do the time out, then you LOCK them in. It;s too much of a 'I'm the mother- you are the child so you must listen to me, if not you get punished' type of book. That doesn't sit well with me at all. <br />The 123 magic way of doing things doesn't TEACH our kids anything. All is does is show one way of stopping them from doing something and then there is a punishment at the end if they don;t obey. <br />Did you get to the part where the author says that children need training the same way wild animals do.? WILD ANIMALS? <BR>He also says that there are times when a spanking may be appropriate. Turn off right there for me. <br />Instead of trying to control our kids and make them obey by making them 'take a 5'., how about we find out WHY they are acting up in the first place? <BR>Lets work with our kids and teach some inner discipline, instead of trying to control, threaten, and punish them. <BR>There is a fine line between discipline and punishment..I think this book crossed that line. <br />Sure there are some good things. I like the chapter on encouraging good behavior, but over all, it;s got 2 thumbs down from me.	2005-04-16

I can't imagine being so cruel to my child. I'm not sure who I blame more, the mother for being so abusive, or the father for letting it happen. They are both bad role models and I was happy to be done with the both of them very early on.  <br /> <br />She went from having a very hard childhood, weird teen years, and not so common happenings as a young lady.

But he did an awesome job. <br />I was pregnant when I read it for the first time and planning a homebirth with midwives. I was not at all afraid to have my homebirth afterwards.

What a man!! If that's not true love, then I don't know what is. <br /> <br />A few things made me laugh. I don;t remember the exact line, and looking back I can;t find it at the moment, but when it was suggested that one reason for women dying after they give birth is because baby did not empty the breast. Also when it was joked by Werenro that a red haired child meant that baby was conceived while the mother was on her period. LOLOLOL <br /> <br />In the begging of the book when it was about Dinah's mothers' I like how it was said that Adah had pelted Laban on the head over and over again after she found out that he had touched some of his daughters innapropretely. WTG Adah! Reading about that time period I was expecting some sort of mention of it, but I was not expecting to read that the man was punished for it by his lowly wife. Needless to say that I was happy when they all left Laban's camps. The guy gave me the creeps and I was happy to be rid of him while I read. <br /> <br />Notice how Dinah was never introduced to anyone? When her mothers' and brothers met Rebecca, plus when they met Jacobs twin brother Dinah, was never once spoken for. I guess if you a girl in that time you don;t exsist between weaning, and getting your period. Nice life. <br /> <br />I love the idea of a Red Tent. Before starting this book I had no idea what the title meant, and it suits the story well! I would love the right to just go off somewhere by myself once a month and not be expected to do a single thing. Thats cool! <br />The party and celebration when girls become women is dear to me, because I plan to do it with my own daughter. I already have the whole thing planned out in my head, I can't wait to do it. <br />The ceremony as described in The Red Tent is not what I would do though. <br />Having my daughter lay outside naked while I stick something in her to break her hymen is not something I'm keen on. <br />\\"It did not hurt. The oil eased the entry, and the narrow triangle fit perfectly as it entered me. I faced the west while the little goddess faced East as she broke the lock on my womb\\" <br />Thats as sick as the circ'ing was.	2005-03-19

So much in this book reminded of the way our great grandparents raised kids, with that 'children are to be seen, not heard' type of attitude. It left a really bad taste in my mouth for so many reasons. <br /> <br />Marilu Henner is one huge contradiction. In this book she says she got an award from LLL (which is true,. I am an LLL leader, and I checked that fact) BUT she goes on to say that there is no reason to breastfeed a 3 year old, and that if they are thirsty, they can drink from a cup. <br />She talks about how nursing at 1 year is beneficial, but she neglects to mention that nursing at 3 is JUST as good.  It's recommended (by all medical and health organizations ) that children nurse *at least* two years, and then as longer after that as both mother and child want. <br /> <br />Some other things that annoyed were written by the co author, this Dr. Sharon chick seems to blame every marital problem on children. If you pay too much attention to your child then your husband will resent the child..if you breastfeed too long then your husband will resent the child, if you co sleep, then your husband will resent your child. oh my gawd the woman is a quack.  <br />    <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-13

I found them both weak, and boring.	2005-03-01

I love how the Sear's tell us in this book that it's OK to hold your child *any time you want*. They make it clear that you don't need a reason to do it.<BR>I'm a SAHM, so I get to sling my baby all day, but my DH works 8-12 hours 6 days a week, and as soon as he comes home and on his day off he takes over the baby wearing and has some great bonding time with our baby.<BR>The book also advises against CIO, wich is a thing that I loath. How any parent can do that to a baby is beyond me. <br />I buy this book for all my pregnant friends. I love it/	2004-01-29

Take anything written by the Ezzo's and have a fire in the backyard.  Although, if you are planning to be abusive parent, then go a head and do what his books say.	2003-12-19
