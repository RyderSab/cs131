The heroes are Noah, age 14, and his sister, Abbie, who is several years younger.  Everyone else, especially the adults, are deeply troubled and/or utterly wacky.  Together, Noah and Abbie mainly keep their well meaning but impetuous father out of jail and hatch a bold plot to put an exceptionally vile, sewage dumping casino owner out of business.   <br /> <br />As usual, Hiassen infuses an abiding love for nature and an abiding fury at those who would harm it.  Mostly this works, but the book sometimes teeters on the brink of sappiness in this respect.  Still, it's a fun and engaging read overall.   <br /> <br />As a final thought, I'm the moderately over-protective dad of a twelve-year old and an eight year old.  I wouldn't let my kids anywhere near Hiaasen's many adult-oriented books.  But like Hoot, this book is completely tween friendly, and my 12-year old enjoyed it.	2005-10-07

But readers who, like me, come to the book with a fuzzy understanding of Dylan as the conscience of the 60s generation--a legendary figure standing against war and social injustice--will be disappointed.  Dylan makes no bones about running as fast and as hard as he can from that role.     <br /> <br />Instead, it's the story (eclectic parts of the story) of a man who loves his family and his music and who wants to be left alone.  Fair enough.  And along the way he shares some nice insights and turns some nice phrases.  But for an icon who prided himself on having something to say, I was disappointed he felt he had so little to do.	2005-09-04

And while the authors make an effort to involve the reader in the protaganists' step-by-step solution to the mystery, they fail.  The answers seem too gimicky and are inaduately explained to convince us they could have remainded hidden from inquisitive scholars for 500 years.   <br /> <br />The authors do a better job painting a lively picture of college life at Princeton.  I was thoroughly envious of the students there by the time I was half-way through the book.	2005-07-31

They include:(1) a study of Galilee at the time of Jesus (by E. P. Sanders); (2) a comparison and analysis of Jesus's teachings with the doctrines contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls (by Daniel J. Harrington); (3) some preliminary musings by John P. Meier about how he will reconcile the Elijah-like miracle working prophet who has emerged to date from his \\"Marginal Jew\\" series with the early remembrance of Jesus as the Davidic Messiah; (4)an assement of the important role of oral traditions as sources for the Gospels (by James D. G. Dunn); and finally, a respected systematic theologian's perspective on the importance and usefulness of honest and objective historical Jesus research in terms of nurturing the Christian faith (by Elizabeth A. Johnson). <br />The contributors are all leading scholars who are excited about their subjects. They brilliantly employ the tools of honest, objective, historical criticism--but they also do not apologise for their faith. This short collection provides an excellent introduction to the work and thought processes of these wonderful scholars. I recommend it highly.	2002-06-13

This book provides a helpful historical study of the ancient Apostles' Creed.  More importantly, it provides expert and loving pastoral guidance on the meaning of each passage in this important summary of the Christian faith.<br />Dr. Barclay views God primarily in terms of a loving and forgiving father--in sharp contrast with those who see God more in terms of a triumphant king bent on destroying his enemies.  Dr. Barclay's view gave him a wonderful perspective on profound issues such as the foregiveness of sin and the meaning of Jesus' death on the cross.  Dr. Barclay dares to hope that God will ultimately restore all of humankind to Himself.  And rather than dying instead of us on the cross (because an offended and vengeful God demands that somebody die as a punishment for sin), Dr. Barclay believes the cross was instead necessary to show humanity that there is no point beyond which the love of our foregiving God will not go.<br />The book provides an articulate, beautiful, and believable summary of Dr. Barclay's view of the Christain faith based on a God who \\"is love.\\"  I highly recommend it.	2002-05-13

I am a Christian who also wants to be intellectually honest in my beliefs. To me, it was refreshing to see two devoted Christians with significantly different views of the historical Jesus engaged in respectful dialogue in which neither acuses the other of heresy. <br />This book presents competing views of the historical Jesus by two writers the editors label as \\"the leading liberal and sonservative Jesus scholars.\\" That might be a bit overbilled, since other scholars such as Meier, Sanders and Crossan come at least as readily to mind. But Wright and Borg are excellent. <br />The \\"Liberal\\" and \\"Conservative\\" labels are also a bit overdone.  Both scholars accept the discipline of rigorous critical scholarship and, again, both are committed Christians-- so they are not so far apart as these labels might imply.  It's not as if a Fundamentalist and an Agnostic are going at each other.  But these complaints are with the billing for the book and not for the book itself, which I found excellent.   <br />Wright, the conservative, sees Jesus as a prophet inaugurating the Kingdom of God who indicated at least in a cryptic way that he was the Messiah of God. He sees the bodily ressurection and the empty tomb as historical events that are foundational for the Christian faith. <br />Borg, the liberal, views Jesus as a social prophet and a healer, a man who called people to a new way of seeing and a new way of living. For him, whether the tomb was empty or not is irrelevent. He believes the Messianic claims contained in the New Testament come from the early Church rather than the historical Jesus. Nevertheless, he sees Jesus as the image of the invisible God. <br />I recommend this book for anyone sympathetic to Christianity who is sincerely interested in the Historical Jesus debate.	2002-03-06

OK, I'm 42, and here's my book report.  <br />I read this book the first time back in about 1968.  I can still remember dreaming about holing up in a tree house on a mountain somewhere while a great blizzard decends, the wind howling through the tree limbs.  And surviving off the wilderness, trapping deer and fishing, hiding out from grownups.  It was a tremendous adventure that has stayed with me through the years. <br />I recently bought this book for my 8-year old boy, but he's still pouring through the Harry Potter series (again), so I re-read it.  It's still tremendous after all these years--the adventure every boy dreams of.  It's a story of total independence and making it on your own, and the hero is as brave and resourcefull as I dreamed I would be if it were me on that mountain.  The book is as entertaining today as it was back then.  I know my boy will love it.  It's magic without witchcraft.	2002-03-01

This book provides a glimpse into the mysteries and theories of time and space--and into the mind and personality of one of the world's most brilliant and creative thinkers.  Both glimpses are worth the substantial effort they require.  And for added incentive, Hawkings unashameadly goes after fascinating subjects that capture the imagination,including space travel, time travel, and the likelihood of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. <br />The book is generously illustrated, although for the most part the pictures are more entertaining than genuinely helpful.  Still, who wouldn't want to see Stephen Hawkings playing poker with Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Commander Data while dangling Marilyn Monroe on his knee?<br />My only reservation is that, despite Hawkings efforts to keep it as simple as possible, there were times when he simply went into Warp Drive (despite Einstein's prohibition) and I became hopelessly lost.  For example, Chapter Three, entitled &quot;The Universe has multiple histories, each of which is determined by a tiny nut,&quot; defeated me completely.<br />Generally, though, Hawkings succeeds in making the big picture available to non-specialists.  And even when we're left far behind, it is enjoyable simply to observe such a great mind in action.	2002-01-29

Crossan tells the story of Jesus as a Mediterranean peasant cynic, and he tells it well, at least in terms of ease of reading.  But he bases his portrait on poorly supported conjecture and speculation--by creatively reading between the lines of the most reliable sources, notably the Canonical Gospels, and placing undue weight on later sources generally thought to be dependent on the Canonical Gospels--e.g., the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Peter, and the Didache.<br />Crossan dismisses out of hand the idea that Scripture could actually be fulfilled in Jesus.  Instead, he views it as self evident that the New Testament fulfillment stories were created out of whole cloth to create the illusion that Jesus literally fulfilled Scriptures.  Granted the New Testament writers may well have embellished some of Jesus's actions with an eye toward symbolic fulfillment of Old Testament Scriptures.  But it seems at least equally likely that in some instances actual events in the life of Jesus reminded his Jewish followers of Scriptures that aptly captured the spirit of the real life situation. <br />Crossan has also decided that physical miracles can't happen.  At the same time, though, he realizes that Jesus was famous as a miracle worker--or as Crossan likes to put it--a magician.  So Crossan believes that, rather than curing actual disease, Jesus \\"healed\\" some of the social effects of disease, for example, by refusing to accept ostracization of lepers and other \\"unclean\\" people.  This was undoubtedly at least one important aspect of Jesus's healing ministry.  But Crossan never really comes to grips with how that sort of limited healing could bring physically crippled, blind, and diseased people flocking to Jesus for physical cures.  <br />These types of unanalyzed and false assumptions are woven throughout the book.  And unfortunatley, in Crossan's own words (as applied to a far nobler text), \\"It is almost easier just to listen and nod or read and agree than to analyze, explore, and disentangle.\\" (P. 150).  For a far more detailed, objective and, for my money, accurate, analysis of the Historical Jesus, I recommend John P. Meier's Marginal Jew series published by Doubleday.	2002-01-25

This short book provides a very readable and helpful overview of the history of the Catholic Church, and particularly the Papacy, from the Apostle Peter to the current Pope, John Paul II.  As a Protestant without a lot of background in Catholic history, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and learned a lot from it.  But as other reviews have noted, it is hardly an unbiased account.  It presents the very unflattering story of a power-hungry papacy that has decreed itself infallible out of whole cloth, discriminates horribly against women, insists against all reason and Biblical authority on the celibacy of the clergy, and is simply hopelessly mired in the Middle Ages.    <br />Because I lean liberal, I found myself agreeing with Kung at every turn. But I have the distinct feeling that I've heard only one side of the story--that there must be another more devout and wholesome side to the story of the Catholic Church that Kung did not see fit to dwell upon.  I'd like to know the rest of the story.	2002-01-19

These lectures clearly reveal Paul Tillich as one of the greatest, most brilliant, theologians of the 20th century.  The book summarizes and critiques the entire history of Christian thought (with special emphasis on German theologians).  Tillich's appraisals of others are completely fair.  His own insights that he shares along the way are those of a devout and brilliant liberal Christian.  He summarizes his approach as follows: &quot;Theology must see both sides, man's essential nature, wonderfully and symbolically expressed in the paradise story, and man's existential condition, under sin, guilt, and death.&quot;<br />I  have only one reservation.  This may well be Tillich's most accessible work, as one reviewer states.  But that speaks more to the difficulty of Tillich's other works than to the ease of working through this treatise.  It is brilliant, it is beautiful, but it is tough going.  I had to reread many passages two or three times to understand them (and a few I simply had to give up on). The book is absolutely worth the effort, but for anyone looking for a somewhat simpler (but excellent) introduction to Christian thought, I would recommend Alister McCrath's &quot;Christian Theology, an Introduction.&quot;	2002-01-12

The notes provide historical context, helpful cross-references, and personal application suggestions.  There are also numerous color maps and an abridged concordance at the back that comes in handy in looking up scriptures you can generally remember but can't place.<br />All contributors to the NIV are Christians who confess the Bible as the inerrant Word of God.  They are very good at what they do, and their lack of scepticism is refreshing in comparison with more liberal study bibles, such as the Harper-Collins.  The overall approach, however, is awfully conservative, sometimes at the risk of intellectual credibility.  For example, traditional attributions of authorship are invariably accepted, including Moses as the author of Genesis through Deuteronomy--a view uniformly rejected by more moderate scholars.  [Even the NIV gives a grudging concession that other writers in addition to Moses seem to have been involved in at least limited additions to the text inasmuch as these books relate Moses' death and describe Moses as &quot;more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth&quot; (Nu. 12:3)--an unlikely self-description by the world's most humble person!]  To me, it is easier and more intellectually honest to simply admit that these books were the work of many inspired hands and that we don't know who wrote them.<br />The doctrinal notes are similarly traditional and conservative.  For instance, in 1 Ti. 4:10, the author proclaims that &quot;God is the Savior of all Men, and especially of those who believe.&quot; The note pours theological cold water on the optimism expressed in this verse by sternly observing, &quot;Obviously, this does not mean that God saves every person from eternal punishment....&quot;  To the contrary, I hope and believe that's exactly what it means--but I guess God will be the judge.<br />To my admittedly liberal way of thinking, the notes tend to take the Bible literally where it fits in with a conservative view point, but, as in 1 Ti.4:10, they brush aside the plain meaning when it does not suit them.  Because I found myself fighting with the notes too often, I have moved on to the less dogmatic NRSV Access Bible, published by Oxford University Press.

More importantly, each book is then carefully analyzed in light of this information for the meaning it conveyed in the social and historical context in which it was written.<br />As another reviewer has said, you can't read this book beneficially without also reading the New Testament.

He explores the Old Testament roots of Mathew's and Luke's Birth Stories and analyzes broad and beautiful topics such as &quot;the Meaning of the Magi&quot; (the Good News is for all who will believe, including Gentiles) and the &quot;Importance of the Shepherds&quot; (they symbolize an Israel that comes to recognize and glorify its Lord Jesus, the Davidic Messiah foretold in the Jewish Scriptures). <br />  Father Brown said he hopes the regognition that there is an adult Christ in the message of Christmas--i.e., that the theological meaning of God's gift of Jesus is included in these beautiful opening verses--will lead believers to proclaim that revelation to others, and that they will respond in faith.

Consistent with the overall quality of the Anchor Bible Series, the &quot;Marginal Jew&quot; series impresses with the depth, honesty, and objectivity of its scholarship.  It may be that nobody is completely impartial when it comes to assessing the historical Jesus, but John Meier comes far closer than most, and he documents every opinion he offers.  (If you're into footnotes, and I mean thousands of them,is this ever the series for you!)<br />     I took on the challenge of this series when I read that Raymond E. Brown, the late great Catholic scholar and author, gave his highest marks to the first two volumes.  Similar to Brown, Meier cooly and adeptly applies the tools of critical scholarship to his task of learning what we can of the historical Jesus.  Fundamentalists will find his approach too liberal.  Jesus Seminar types will find him too conservative.  As a believing Christian who also wants to be intellectually honest in my faith, I think he's just right.	2001-11-19

This is a terrific resource for readers who really desire to grow in their understanding of the Bible and Biblical times.  The notes are very good, providing pertinent historical and  cultural information and insightful analysis. They're straight forward and really help to illuminate the entire Bible,  especially the more difficult passages.  They're also user- friendly, providing the information right there rather than sending the reader off on a hunt through a maze of cross references.  <br />My comparisons are with the NIV Study Bible (which I found too conservative and rigid)and the Harper-Collins Study Bible (which I found too technical and almost secular in their approach).  This Bible strikes a happy medium--real,user friendly scholarship, presented in an uplifting way.  For me it really helps in sorting out the time bound, cultural aspects of the Bible from the eternal truths we should cling to forever.  <br />If I have one complaint, it's that there are no headings within the text to help the reader locate specific passages (e.g., &quot;The Transfiguration&quot; or &quot;Feeding the 5,000.&quot;)  But that's pretty picky--it's a wonderful book!	2000-09-29

This book lovingly and insistently reveals the fatal flaws--and the societal dangers--associated with the the all too popular notion among many Christians that God is love, and God is good. . . and yet God will banish  most of humankind to eternal damnation.<br />The book is written from a  Roman Catholic perspective, but it also provides a wonderful antidote to  the vengeful God of Protestant Fundamentalism.<br />The book is simple and  direct, and it provides solid scriptural and contextual bases for its  thesis that God loves each one of us immeasurably and will never give up on  any of us. What a concept!<br />Although the authors' views are well grounded  in scripture and are supported by highly respected scholars, they seem to  remain largely hidden from mainstream popular Christianity. This will be a  wonderful book to share with people who are sincerely struggling with these  issues !	1999-08-28

I spent a month with it.  It is a compact, scholarly, and informative introduction to a very important and complex subject.  Father Brown apologizes neither for his faith nor for the  generally unblinking, critical scholarship he applies to to his subject.   This book is a treasure for Christians who seek to love the Lord their God  with all their minds.	1999-07-29
