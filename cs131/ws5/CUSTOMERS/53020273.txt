I approached this book with great anticipation --  very good reviews, potentially interesting story line but, aas it turned out,  I was really disappointed and borderline annoyed that this book had received the hype that it did. I was about 2/3 's of the way through and struggling to finish it and mentioned it  to a friend of mine who is a published author, whose opinions I respect ,and asked him about this book and he said \\"he just gave up\\" about 1/2 way through --however, I did persist and with some judicious scanning did finish it. I did, however, like the beginning, thought it was funny and clever and really enjoyed Kunkel's capturing of some of the \\"voices\\"  in a very humourouis way, (e.g. his father and mother) but once he goes off to Ecuador the book really sinks and goes absolutely nowhere as far as I am concerned. But, as they say, you don't know what something tastes like unless you try it ...and this one just didn't do it for me.	2005-10-03
US	53020273	R2R0WFHNXX8H6N	1594480370	265537421	Anja the Liar	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	An interesting read	I found Anja the Liar to be one of those reads that, as you advance through it, it captures your interest. It is  a hard book to recommend since it is somewhat difficult to define. It does have some interesting historical material related to the whole DP situation at the conclusion of WWII and the disbursement of people at that time. But I did think that the odd triangle that develops in the latter part of the novel is somehwat contrived ..and that some of  the characters were not fully defined ...but saying all this, I did enjoy the novel and found it to be a real page turner towards the end.	2005-09-27

It is as if you had prior knowledge of them as you begin to read any one of the stories.  <br />She also has a literary  \\"trick\\" of sorts   that I really enjoyed in that she will make reference to some little item --almost as a throwaway that was featured in an earlier story in the collection. It is very subtle but a nice little device that I caught on to and served to enhance the experience even more. <br />And though this collection was published sometime ago I found these wonderful stories still timely.  I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys this genre. <br />Now on to purchase soem of her other works.	2005-09-07

Having just finished his latest book, I can say, unequivocally, that this is a wonderful writer! with a very distinguished  and impressive style. I really felt that I was with the narrator  Amrit as he travels the Northeastern border of India in his quest to uncover the story of the woman in the photograph. I had the pleasure of hearing Deb read from his first book  awhile back and recently heard him on NPR discussing his research and goals with this latest book  and can heartily recommend it and feel quite confident that you will not only enjoy it but agree with me that we are reading someone who will become an importnat writer of our times.	2005-05-07

Well, this is a very well written and very introspective book; and having learned that the author  translated much of Richard Brautigan's and Raymond Carver's work into German you can see the influence in his writing style. It's a very suspenseful read  with lot's of interesting detours. Would love to read some of the author's other works --if and when they are translated into English.	2004-11-22

Many of these stories reminded me  of some of Issac Singer's NY works. I was  circling LaGuardia Airport last night due to weather problems in the NYC area and had the good fortune to have this slim collection to keep me company and take my mind off the three extra hours of travel time I had to deal with. I, of course, finished the book during this time frame and wished there were more stories to delve into, but alas, they were finished so quickly . So,I await the author's next excursion into the richness of his memories of growing up in Toronto and his family's experiences and memories of surviving the  devastation that befell them in their homeland and the difficulties they incurred when they arrived in Canada. I heartly and unequivically recommend this book to all who have some connectiion with the immigrant experience.	2004-08-31

I took a peek at some of the other reviews and they have said what I want to say far better than I can ..but  what I enjoyed most about this book is the author''s &quot;voice&quot; --- by this I mean that  this  book seems so personal that I felt  that I amost knew the author, and his life   experiences, by the time I finished it .

However, while I find myself totally captivated by the Ystad/Wallender series (and perhaps this is due to my familiarity with the main character and his colleagues --similar to the many policeprocedurals of the Ruth Rendall/P.D. James genre) I found this book sort of going off into somewhat cliched terrritories -- almost of the Robert Ludlam/Fredric Forsyth types --with inklings of (...) plots and several plot twists that were less than plausible. Interestingly, though he was described as quite different than Wallender (younger, etc) I kept on visualizing Wallender on this case.  In short, I enjoyed the read but found much of it to be filler and fortunately I hung into the end which was very exciting.	2004-04-01

My only criticism of this book is that it ended too soon  The wonderful story of these players and how they rose from humble means to become the stars that they eventually became was just so enjoyable. In particular, the heroics and tragedy of Ted Williams --the years he lost to baseball serving as a combat pilot , his inabilities as both hsuband and father...serve as the core of this book. I wondered whether it was the times, the particular situation of being Red Sox stars or the fact that they played with Ted Williams  that made this story so enticing or could you take ANY four major league players and create the same story as is presented in this book? I somehow doubt it. In any event , it is a great read and reinforces my theory that baseball is the sport that translates best to the written page.	2003-08-04

There is very little &quot;story&quot; and what little there is I found disjointed and diffcult to follow. This may be due to the translation but I think not -- I would not recommend this book at all.	2003-07-21

I very much admired his earlier book  \\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" and have been doing a major \\"word of mouth\\" on that first book among my circle of acquaintances (who have also enjoyed it). I am so impressed with the research that Liss evidently must do to create the elaborate plots and detail he conveys --you truly can feel (and smell) 17th century Amsterdam. However, I did feel that the plot, or rather the complexity of the stock transactions were at times a bit too convuluted but overall it is a wonderful and fascinating read.

Briony's hospital experiences reminded me somewhat of Pat Barker's trilogy of World War One horrors and a slim  novel that I had read recently called The Officer's Ward which also detailed the horrors of war and its effect on the human condition and spirit....enough said ..read Atonement --it's wonderful!!!	2002-04-08

I must say that I was slightly disappointed (but not nearly as much as some of the other reviewers who apparently were rather displeased and quite critical of the book) In any event, it is, like all of Mr. Kapuscinski's books, an involving ande engrossing read but is is somewhat  inconsistent and does meander at times. In short, I think this author has done a better job when he has taken a more specifc issue or period of time --like the fall of one particular nation or it's ruler and here he has tried to capture the complexities and enormity of a whole continent..and at times he does go off the path --but still and all a very interesting and fascinating read. Interestingly, like Colin Thurbon who has studied Central Asia and Siberia in similar depth --neither author really shares much of their personal life which I think would be equally interesting to read about.	2001-12-18

This book is incredibly engrossing and Liss' style of writing --invoking the 18th nCentury vernecular for his storyteller --Benjamin Weaver is quite fetching. While the story gets a bit complicated at times...and one needs to occasionally refer back to establish a particular storyline this chronicle of the first stock crash in England in the early 1700's is so precise and detailed that you literally live and breath the excitment and intrigue on each page.

I haev read quite a bit of and about the Gulag --and the camps --primarily Solzeneichtin (not sure of the spelling) and have been greatly fascinated by the incredible destruction and persecution imposed on the Russian people by Stalin and his cruel despotic regime but this book brought the cold and hopelessness of this vast region a lot closer to me. I look forward to reading other books by Thurbon and have also ordered Valentin Rasputin's book about Siberia as an attempt to grasp more of this subject. I do, however, agree with some of the other customer revierwers that Thurbon could have given more of himself  by letting us know more about how he went about planning this trip, who helped him along the way, etc. Now maybe that would ahve taken away from the narrative flow --or maybe that's another book in itself but I felt he was a bit too matter of fact on how he got from one place to another, But saying all that, I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to reading his other travel essays that are still in print.	2001-05-01

It's been awhile since I came across a book that so totally captivated me and involved me in its very core as did All The Names...I resist sort of supernatural type books wihich is why I had passed up Saramago's other most recent book --Blindness but somehow the controlled absurdity and intensity of this book left me almost breathless as I read it.....the situations he presents...the depth of obsession was, to be totally cliched, almost Kafkaesque in its delivery ....this is a wonderful read and I can't wait to investigate his earliewr works...read it ! it's wonderful!	2000-11-13

Dave and Neil, I feel like I know them &amp; have  traveled with them after reading their book, can have me as a travel  companion anytime they wish.Order it now and you'll appreciate what I'm  saying about this delightful book.	2000-01-14

Now, like many people I am often recommended to &quot;how to&quot; &amp; &quot;why&quot; books on various  business subjects -and I find that they are usually quite ponderous and dry  and I generally last about a chapter --not so with this book --Underhill  presents a POV on a subject that many of us take for granted --how people  shop and why they do what they do when they are in  a bank or a store.  Obviously, since his business is studying this subject in all its minute  details, he has had ample opportunity to study and probe vast amounts of  film and this experience has provided him with insights that are both  fascinating and, at times, quite humorous as he explores the human  condition in that very American -- and now increasing global activity of  shop 'til you drop. In short, it's ainteresting and informative read and  every store manager should be given thisn bookm as required reading --as  well as &quot;civilians&quot; who frequent these establishments--large and  small.	1999-04-15

I discovered Norman Lewis years ago --and have read most of his novels (which I will now go back and re-read). He makes travel as exciting and involving as, of course, it is and along with Pico  Iyer makes everyday that I sit behind my desk or hit my computer one less  day of adventure or learning. He manages to be so modest about his  achievements and his innante curiousity while presenting a panorama of  travel thst is as interesting as any travle writing I have ever read --and  it makes you thirst for more and more detail about his experiences  throughout the world..highly recommend this for anyone who has the  slightest essence of wanderlust!	1999-01-04

Timequake and Vonnegut's wonderful, amusing and unique musings made what would have been an uncomfortable and interminably long flight back from Istanbul into an absolute delight! It brought  me back in time to what I  enjoyed about his earlier books and made me laugh out loud. Yet, there was  a real bittersweet quality to it as well, one could almost say a  &quot;downer&quot; aspect to it as he said farewell to friends and family  who have gone on to their just rewards...but here is this 70+ year old mad  offering an innocent idealism that is so refreshing, and so naive in this  cut throat/techy world we dwell in --in any case, I loved it, and wished  that it had gone on for the next 2 hours of my 10 hour flight.	1998-10-29

You know how you get a feeling about a book --it's cover design, the  description on the jacket, some aspect of the book that kind of gets you  interested. Well, that's what happened with The Treatment. Maybe I'm a  sucker for short titles or whatever but this book really delivered and  offers  a highy involving, entertaining and quite funny read while  presenting, at least it did to me, a great many ideas and thoughts about  what this whole thing we do, called living, is all about. Now I know I may  be &quot;overselling&quot; this book but I highly recommend it as a  wonderful urban, contemporary read.And I can't wait for the author to write  his next novel.	1998-09-15

Discovering a new author and enjoying the first book you read of theirs and then the awaited eagerness of reading their earlier books. The Untouchable is a wonderful, engrossing read with John Banville displaying a great gift for language and plot line. It was like the first Graham Greene or John LeCarre that I read, well-written, engrossing, a true protoypical page turner...I am curious now to see whether this is Banville's style, the exquisite use of language and biting and ironic humor or is it the &quot;style&quot; of Victor Maskell, the protagonist and narrator of this wonderfully written book..I highly recommend it to all espionage fans, anglophiles and anyone who is as fascinated as I am with the Cambridge/Cold War/Double agent phase of recent British history	1997-06-05

Andorra is wonderful reading, a fairy tale that will appeal to the dreamer and escapist in us all. I love to tell people about the books I read and this book's ending does not allow that at all..so I suggest you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down and you will, I beleive become enchanted and captivated by its characters, setting and mood.Does anyone have a copy of Leap Year which is evidently out of print	1997-02-21
