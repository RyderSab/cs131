But this book is still useable (although more difficult) if you don't have that background, because the author carefully and clearly explains all the aspects of the grammar. As such, this book can almost serve as a model for teaching the more neglected Romance languages.<br /><br />I should warn you about an inevitable problem you may face: the book uses the standard writing system for Sicilian, warts and all.  For example, \\"in order to\\" is \\"pi\\" (pronounced like English \\"pea\\"), and \\"to go\\" is \\"iri\\", pronounced \\"yiri\\" (like English \\"yearly\\" without the \\"l\\"); but combining them produces a phonetic change that standard spelling sometimes writes as \\"pi iri\\" (not noting the change at all), or as \\"pi gghiri\\", expressing the geminate /g/ sound with the letter cluster \\"ggh\\" that is familiar only to students of standard mainland Italian.  A more phonetic notation would always write \\"pi\\" with a symbol noting that it causes a phonetic change in the following word, and \\"iri\\" as \\"yiri\\", and would write the combined form as something like \\"pi-ggiri\\". However, if you learned from a book that used such a phonetic notation, you'd have a lot of trouble adjusting to the standard writing system that you'd see everywhere outside of such a book.<br /><br />So the author works out a compromise: when he introduces a word like \\"pi\\" that changes the following word, he notes this by writing it \\"pi+\\" for a few pages; and when an unusual pronounciation occurs, the author very often marks it -- for example, noting that \\"pi iri\\" can also be written as \\"pi gghiri\\", or that \\"in vucca\\" (in the mouth) can also be written as \\"nvucca\\" or \\"mmucca\\", and so on.<br /><br />Also, Italian stress is usually unmarked, but the author deals with that problem by boldfacing stressed syllables in some cases.  But I wish that the author had done this everywhere, instead of just here and there.  However, this is only a minor distraction for students.  On the whole, the book is a model of clarity!the author works out a compromise: when he introduces a word like \\"pi\\" that changes the following word, he notes this by writing it \\"pi+\\" for a few pages; and when an unusual pronounciation occurs, the author very often marks it -- for example, noting that \\"pi iri\\" can also be written as \\"pi gghiri\\", or that \\"in vucca\\" (in the mouth) can also be written as \\"nvucca\\" or \\"mmucca\\", and so on. <br /> <br />Also, Italian stress is usually unmarked, but the author deals with that problem by boldfacing stressed syllables in some cases.

The book assumes you know nothing about databases and only the rudiments of Perl.  It has lots and lots of examples, and several parts that I find myself coming back to often as a reference.<br />The book starts with a very brief introduction to the basic concepts and jargon of databases (about 35 pages), and then it jumps into the meat of the book, 13 chapters (about 450 pages) that mainly teach by example.  That is, when a chapter explains something (whether it's a bit of SQL syntax like &quot;select max(x) from y where...&quot;, or a concept like transactions, or an interface detail like templates or tied hashes), it explains it in terms of how it solves a problem.<br />Then the book illustrates each idea in terms of a real program that does a real task -- like a program for a CGI-based photo database, or a command-line program that searches a database of books, or a Tk-based (GUI) program that searches an address-book database.  Each program's source is shown in full, and also with explanation of a few lines a time.  Experienced and attentive readers can freely skip a lot of the commentary, but those explanations can come in very handy if you're not very experienced, or if you are reading the chapters out of order (as you might, if you jump in and want to try writing a program like in chapter 10, without reading all of 1-9 first).  The Perl code is unassuming, clear, robust, and rigorously secure.<br />The book ends with 40 pages of appendices (plus 30 pages of index).  The first of the four appendices is a tutorial on installing Perl, the Perl database modules, MySQL, and a web server -- I found this very helpful for setting up a development environment on my laptop so that I could experiment with database programming.  The second appendix is a reference of the most common SQL commands, with examples.  The third appendix is a reference of useful MySQL-specific commands, with examples.  The last appendix is a reference to DBI commands (the Perl module for talking to databases).  I have found all these appendices very worthwhile, and I refer to them quite often.<br />Before I read this book, I had been avoiding using real databases for years, and I instead used flakey substitutes like flat-file &quot;databases&quot;, or simple Unix DBMs.  I read this book on and off over the course of a few weeks, and at the end I thought &quot;that's it!?  This isn't so hard!  What was I avoiding all these years!?&quot;.  And I got up and within hours wrote a database-based CGI system that I had been meaning to write for ages.  Over the years, I have come to recognize this feeling of &quot;this book makes it look so easy!  I REALLY wish I had read it years ago!&quot; as the sign of a great book.pendix is a reference to DBI commands (the Perl module for talking to databases).

It's like Derrida doing a travel magazine article, except with more jargon.<br /><br />Since this is an ethnography, you occasionally learn a fact or two, like the fact that there's more things written in English than in Navajo -- which the reader could possibly have predicted from the facts that Navajoland is surrounded by the US, and that most Navajos were not taught to read and write Navajo in school. But because this book is from the bad old days of 1980s postmodern anthro, the facts are few and far between, and the book's 200-odd pages are filled with navel-gazing about how challenging it is to write about this subject which the author would be writing about (i.e., Navajos and literacy) if he weren't instead writing ABOUT writing about it.<br /><br />If this were exactly the only book ever written about Native Americans and/or literacy, it might be worth reading.  Lucking, there are other books, which makes it hard for me to imagine there ever being a reason to spend time reading this empty and uninformative book.

The newly emerging approaches to language termed \\"Functional and Cognitive Linguistics,\\" however, are much less formally oriented. Instead, functional and cognitive approaches to language structure are typically couched in terms already familiar to cognitive scientists: perception, attention, conceptualization, meaning, symbols, categories, schemas, perspectives, discourse context, social interaction, and communicative goals.<br />The account of human linguistic competence emerging from this new paradigm should be extremely useful to scientists studying how human beings (not formal devices) comprehend, produce, and acquire natural languages. The current volume brings together 10 of the most important linguists in cognitive and functional linguistics whose work is often not easily available to those outside the field. In original contributions, each of these scholars focus on an important aspect of human linguistic competence, with a special eye to readers who are not professional linguists. Of special importance to all of the contributions are the cognitive and social interactional processes that constitute human linguistic communication.

For example: &quot;In Cherokee tourism in the mid-1990s, semiotic potency, use-value, and exchange-value intersected in compelling ways.  Syllabic objects were differentiated in terms of their semiotic use potential.  The distinction had to do with whether syllabic objects were considered to possess symbolic use-value, which, in the case of texts, meant that they were considered to have significant and specific meanings or performative powers.&quot;  So the bad news is that now and then, the book pops up with a few irritating sentences like that.  But the good news is that the rest of the book is nice and clear.<br />Besides being great for reading on your own, this book is great reading for any university-level class involving sociolinguistics, Native fieldwork and Native community relations and literacy teaching, and maybe even modern Native cultures in general.and maybe even modern Native cultures in general.	2002-07-23

I heartily recommend this...<br />Quoting the publisher's blurb for this book:<br />A mainstay of functional linguistics has been the claim that linguistic elements and patterns that are frequently used in discourse become conventionalized as grammar. This book addresses the two issues that are basic to this claim: first, the question of what types of elements are frequently used in discourse and second, the question of how frequency of use affects cognitive representations.<br />Reporting on evidence from natural conversation, diachronic change, variability, child language acquisition and psycholinguistic experimentation the original articles in this book support two major principles. First, the content of people's interactions consists of a preponderance of subjective, evaluative statements, dominated by the use of pronouns, copulas and intransitive clauses. Second, the frequency with which certain items and strings of items are used has a profound influence on the way language is broken up into chunks in memory storage, the way such chunks are related to other stored material and the ease with which they are accessed to produce new utterances...	2002-06-29

But if you're doing serious SGML development, you have no choice but to get this book and to spent forever trying to make sense of it.<br /><br />But beware: if you're doing just XML, and if you think \\"well, since XML is a form of SGML, I might as well get the SGML standard\\", don't do it!

Hippocrene Books, the publishers of this dictionary, are apparently learning new skills.  So far they have been good at carefully printing up badly written dictionaries.  But with this book, they demonstrate their new skill: horribly printing a well-written dictionary.  They managed to take a fine manuscript, and so bungle its typesetting that the result is totally useless.  You see, in production, some of the accented characters got their accents deleted.  But apparently most of the accented characters simple got replaced by an apostrophe. Yes, when you see \\"balch'a\\" in this printing, it might really be\\"balch'a\\", or it might be \\"balch&aacute;a\\", \\"balch&eacute;a\\", \\"balch&iacute;a\\", \\"balch&oacute;a\\", or \\"balch&uacute;a\\".<br /><br />I, who don't even speak Yoeme, noticed this within minutes of opening the book and flipping thru it.  How this ever got printed, much less shipped and distributed, is a wonder beyond reckoning.<br /><br />And I'm not the only person to have noticed this problem.  David L. Shaul, the junior author (who Hippocrene mistakenly identify on the cover and back as the ONLY author) wrote the following in the bulletin of the The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA, issue 90), which (I hope) suggests that maybe the authors might come out with a better edition later, with an actually competent publisher:<br /><br />\\"Recently, the Hippocrene edition of a Yoeme and English dictionary appeared. This was given notice in the SSILA newsletter. This publication is marred by three factors: (1) the cover and spine have only the name of the junior author (myself), not the primary, Yoeme authors; (2) the copyright notice is only given in the junior author's name (despite the fact that on the contract it is mentioned that copyright is in all three names; and (3), the galley proofs that were submitted to the publisher in late November 1999 were not incorporated into the book. This latter problem is complicated by the fact that the typesetting program used by the publisher introduced typos by converting accented vowels into other sequences; in fact, the proof for the grammar section was not even seen by the authors.<br /><br />\\"None of the authors even saw a copy until told by others that there were copies in the local Borders in Tucson.<br /><br />\\"I have asked the Yaqui tribal attorney to write a letter to Hippocrene, asking that the books be withdrawn.

When I first got this book, I thought \\"CGI is a much more complex standard than this! For example, what about all the strange things you can do with hidden form variables?\\" Then in occurred to me that the unifying theme of this book is not \\"everything you can do with CGI\\" -- it's \\"everything you can do with CGI, done SECURELY\\".<br />All the various CGI tricks I'd known and used that weren't mentioned in this book, were the sort of thing that a beginning programmer might misuse, and thereby accidentally create a way for some malicious user to, for example, delete or corrupt any file on the filesystem, or order any product for [price]. Since /most/ beginning programmers create programs with just those kind of accidental security problems, I'm glad that this book sees security as a primary goal.<br />In other words: they show you how to do anything you need in CGI, but they don't give you enough rope to hang yourself with! The other thing that makes me happy with this book is that it wisely takes the (very realistic) perspective that CGIs are programs that have to do something /besides/ just talking to the Web browser -- they have to access a database, send a piece of mail, read from a config file, write to a log file, or whatever other details the task demands. That's just the way the CGI business is, and this book gives you a nice introduction to that way of programming.<br />I heartily recommend this book for anyone who's starting out doing CGI programming. It assumes you do know some Perl already. If you don't, and you already have a strong programming background in some other language than Perl, can probably just make do with the Perl man pages; but less experienced folks should get /Learning Perl/, or /Elements of Programming with Perl/, or maybe even /Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours/ (which has a good CGI section, incidentally).<br />One note: currently this book is in its first printing, so there are, as always, typos.

For example, the author tells us that the name for Albuquerque, in Navajo, means &quot;two bells in place&quot;; but he does not tell us that actual name, Bee'ald&iacute;&iacute;l Dah Sinil.<br />In the preface, the author offers an explanation for this oddity:<br />&quot;Regarding Indian place names, with but few exceptions I've presented their meanings but not their sounds; even the best transliterations do no more than approximate the actual sounds of the Indian words, and transliterations encourage the gross corruptions from which Indian names have suffered over the years.  Persons who want to hear the sound of the Indian names should consult a native speaker.&quot;<br />This is really just stupid.  One could similarly argue for the exclusion of all French words from etymologies in English dictionaries -- after all, French &quot;transliterations&quot; do no more than approximate the actual sounds of the French words.  And anyway, if you write it down, someone will just mispronounce it.  So, better to just ask a French person?<br />And this is particlarly silly considering this is from University of New Mexico Press, the same press that publishes the Young &amp; Morgan lexicons of Navajo -- which, incidentally, have thorough coverages of placenames, which is of interest to anyone who, unlike this author, considers Native names the subject of scholarship.<br />Hopefully reason will prevail, and in some future edition, the Native names will actually be listed instead of merely hinted at.	2000-10-31

They have long ago blasted off into hyperspace, filled with sad, but no less ecstatic, dreams of a telematic history that will never be theirs to code. An evangelical class, schooled in the combinatorial logic of virtual reality and motivated by missionary consciousness, the technological class is already descending into the spiralling depths of the sub-human.  It wills itself to the will to virtuality.  In return for this act of monumental hubris, it will be ejected as surplus matter by the gods of virtuality, once its servofunction has been digitally reproduced.  In Dante's new version of the circling rings of virtual reality, this class operates under the sign of an ancient curse: it is wrong, just because it is so right.  For not understanding the virtual hubris, it is condemned to eternal repetition of the same data byte.&quot;<br />And that's one of the clearer paragraphs.<br />The endless stream of sentences that parse, without actually saying anything, eventually put me in the mind of &quot;travesty generators&quot; -- computer programs that, given a set of phrases, and a passably complex grammar for combining them randomly, can spew out infinite amounts of blather, just like the above.  For example:<br />&quot;If one examines social realism, one is faced with a choice: either reject the neoconstructivist paradigm of narrative or conclude that the collective is capable of significance. Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a postcapitalist sublimation that includes art as a reality. Any number of narratives concerning textual objectivism exist.  'Class is intrinsically dead,' says Sontag; however, according to Scuglia[1] , it is not so much class that is intrinsically dead, but rather the failure of class. In a sense, Lyotard promotes the use of postcapitalist sublimation to deconstruct society. The subject is contextualised into a predialectic capitalism that includes language as a totality.&quot;<br />That paragraph was generated by a computer program.<br />And that program didn't even need a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, as /Data Trash/ says that it did.<br />Whatever ideas (as opposed to mere themes, which is all I can find in most of the book) of worth that there might be in this book are buried under prose too turgid to imagine.Class is intrinsically dead,' says Sontag; however, according to Scuglia[1] , it is not so much class that is intrinsically dead, but rather the failure of class.

(Of course, you could happen to be both kind of person at once -- a  not-advanced programmer picking up Perl to do some CGI programming.)  No  other Perl book I've seen so far manages to serve both audiences so  well.<br />The part of the book (the first 3/5ths or so) that's intro to  general Perl is good, clear, and free of any typos I've noticed.  The  current printing I saw tended to scrimp on whitespace (so you see  &quot;$x=$y*stuff($z)&quot; instead of somehting more like &quot;$x = $y *  stuff($z)&quot;), but I don't think it's /too/ much of a problem; and I've  emailed the author and he says he'll see about getting that changed in  later printings.<br />The section on CGI is the real windfall here.  I'm sure  that the author could have just banged out a chapter or two of &quot;Hello  World&quot; CGIs plus a form2mail and a guestbook, and called that it; and  the book would probably have sold just as well from casual  buyers.<br />Instead, he ended up writing the absolute best and most careful  discussion of CGI I've seen to date.  Most importantly, if you're a  new-to-CGI programmer and you read this book, I think it'll steer you clear  of the nastier pitfalls better than any other book I've seen.  That  includes things that work but that open security holes, as well as things  that just don't work.<br />And, incidentally, the book doesn't cost much, so I  can recommend that even an advanced CGI programmer (even one not coding in  Perl!) go and plunk down the ~$20, just because the long (about 2/5ths of  the book, it seems) and deliberate section on CGI is bound to discuss  /something/ you didn't know.  I, for example, particularly benefited from  the comprehensive and patient discussion of the benefits and limitations of  the various ways to pass session-state around between CGI program  instances.n-state around between CGI program  instances.	2000-07-04

The opinions in this are most superficial but generally interesting, and make for an undemanding afternoon's read.<br />But good God, do we have to picket Stephenson's publisher to get an editor assigned to him?  Stephenson  says in four paragraphs what he could just as well say in two sentences.  Much of this essay reads like someone just strung together the posts in a  ranty Usenet thread.  This, folks, is the kind of thing an editor is  supposed to stop from happening.  And unlike most bad writing, it's a  /pity/, because this could have actually been a very good essay.	2000-07-04

I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, esp. given the dearth of teaching materials for any Native languages. But being shown how to say \\"brandy snifter\\" or \\"Pluto\\" in Navajo does make one wonder about the cultural applicability of these endeavors.<br />(This reminds me of the Duden dictionaries that used the same illustration-templates for every edition -- based on the German -- so that in the English-Thai edition, we could all be shown how to say \\"serving pot for boiled potatoes\\" in languages whose cultures had no such concept.)<br />In short, I worry that this is very inappropriate for Navajo culture.  It may have /some/ useful vocabulary in it, but on the whole it seems very unreliable.	2000-05-08

How they can honestly come out with a dictionary like this, that has an English  entry for &quot;eighteen&quot; but not &quot;eight&quot;?<br />So, yes,  coverage in the lexicon is weak.  Moreover, the author's notion of phonetic  notation is unintelligible (but could easily have been edited into shape).  Gender is not noted for nouns, nor is it noted how they form the plural (as  is not always predictable in Sicilian, as the author himself notes), which  seriously detracts from the usefulness of the book.  The notes on  pronounciation (and morphology) are about as linguistically confused as  three small pages can be.  And the spelling isn't even consistent -- the  author has a headword &quot;libbru&quot; (book), and elsewhere spells it  &quot;libru&quot;.  If this reflects two possible pronounciations, then  both should have been noted in the entry.  The orthography, instead of  transcribing Sicilian as a language in and of itself, too often decides to  try to mangle the standard Italian writing system (which is rather  insufficient to the task!) into conveying Sicilian pronunciation.  This  seems part of a general pattern of assuming the reader is fluent in  standard Italian, which is about as useless as an assumption can be.<br />I've  no doubt that the author put great effort into this book, and it should  have fallen to editors at Hippocrene Books to point out where changes  should have been made, to make it a fine dictionary.  But apparently they  did nothing of the sort, and so the final product ends up looking like an  unusable mess.	2000-04-29

I agree with Steele's main point: that US society's only real motive in supporing affirmative action (and other policies that seek structural solutions to structural problems) is not authentic concern for American blacks, but merely trying to assuage a sense of guilt.<br />This is a great start, and I'm very eager to see this interesting idea developed! But unfortunately Steele takes it nowhere fast. In the end it just turns into bad writing based on plain old unexamined assumptions, instead of reasoned argumentation and support. Provocative ideas like this deserve better.<br />The main problem is the author simply assumes not that his POSITION is right and others' POSITIONS are wrong; but that HE is right and anyone else is wrong. But he refute their ideas, he has to at leasten to them for a minute; and he doesn't.  Instead, it turns into really silly double standards of the sort: I am reasoned, THEY are fuzzy-headed; I uphold principles, THEY are beholden to superficialities; I voice my objections, THEY mindlessly repeat slogans; I am responsible for my freedom and agency, THEY are all cowed and cowardly. I am strident; and they resent that! And so on, and so forth, until you don't know which is worse -- that, or his interminable verbal benders where he seems intent on constructing as many sentences as possible entirely out of abstract nouns. (Try the Shelby Steele drinking game: take a drink for every sentence including any three of the words \\"freedom\\", \\"merit\\", \\"virtue\\", \\"ulteriority\\", or \\"responsbility\\". Double-score for for \\"moral accountability\\".)<br />Now, some writers just have their quirks, but Steele's bad habits just go on and on until they crowd out absolutely everything else. He overuses scare quotes. He charges ahead with weird generalizations that just leave you scratching your head: \\"Thus kitsch is always an invitation to a consoling sense of superiority.\\" It... it is? Always? Invitation? What? \\"Ersatz virtue will thrive precisely to protect us from the risk of being stigmatized that real virtue always entails.\\" It does? \\"'Diversity' and 'multiculturalism' have no substance as ideas except where they connote perfection exactly where America was shameful.\\" I try to figure out what this means, but I can't get past the scare quotes and the nebulous abstract nouns and the assertion of a negative.  Any decent editor would have said \\"Shelby, can you just say what you mean here?\\".  But his publisher apparently didn't think he was worth a decent editor.<br />Steele seems happiest when the abstract nouns he's constellating are nice short words that gloss over the grey areas of American life: upholding educational \\"standards\\" glosses over the possiblity that one's SAT score may be a measure of nothing more \\"virtuous\\" than one's ability to score well on the SAT; \\"responsibility\\" and \\"individuality\\" and even \\"freedom\\" are clean-cut concepts only in a world where everyone has equal access to credit, education, and personal or family wealth. But he treats these all as absolutes; you're free, or you're not. You're responsible, or not. The dualisms pile up.<br />And the grandest dualism of all is his view of American ethnicity: black people, and those white people who feel guilty about those horrible things they did to black people, what with national original sin and whatnot. With this laughably minimalist view as the starting point, it's no wonder he strains to fill 180 pages. Life is so simple when you can see only two colors.<br />And all the while I had the nagging feeling that if Steele'd bothered to have a look at the relationship between Native Americans and white America's guilt manifest thru government, he'd have a much broader and deeper history to test his abstract generalizations against. But why ruin a good theory with bothersome data, especially complicated data with lots of grey areas? But THAT could have made for a book worth reading.the risk of being stigmatized that real virtue always entails.\\" It does? \\"'Diversity' and 'multiculturalism' have no substance as ideas except where they connote perfection exactly where America was shameful.\\" I try to figure out what this means, but I can't get past the scare quotes and the nebulous abstract nouns and the assertion of a negative.

Eco traces this idea starting from its  roots in ancient times, and he goes into fine detail in discussing the  &quot;philosophical languages&quot; of the Renaissance, before discussing  more recent constructed languages (Esperanto and the like).<br />The prose is  very clear and straightforward, and the subject full of interesting nooks  and crannies.<br />The book is most valuable in that, once you've read it, you  will start recognizing the &quot;perfect language&quot; idea popping up  everywhere -- the idea that if we just stick to a really rigid formalism  (which we're /almost/ finished coming up with!), then we can get everything  right.  This idea appears in everything from formalist linguistics  (&quot;since the framework is perfect, you just plug in the right  parameters for your language, and it works!&quot;), to the voodoo equations  of quantitative political science (&quot;and this formula /explains/ why  the Sino-Japanese war happened!&quot;), to American law (&quot;I don't care  if this law is just -- I'm talking about whether, formally, it's  Constitutional; because that's what really matters!&quot;), to the endless  wars over which is the best programming language (&quot;Python is better  than Perl because it's based on objects, and if you don't understand why  that's important, you need to learn more lambda calculus, and indent your  code more /correctly/!&quot;).<br />It'll make you think twice about anything  that needlessly uses a formalism for expressing what could be said just  fine in one of these mundane languages we speak!	2000-03-11

They may speak it well, or may speak it haltingly, or may only remember a few phrases.  And then they  die, and there went the language.  Since most of the languages in the US  and in the world are headed toward that fate in the next forty years, I  think it's time people get to see what it looks like, and what a great loss  it is.<br />Second off, this book is the closest I've seen anyone manage to  explaining what it is that we linguists do.  If only this book got half the  press that Steven Pinker's ramnblings get!<br />And third off, this book  recalls some of the daily experiences of the author's travels in rural  Australia, among the Aborigines.  As one rarely reads anything about  Australian Aborigines, or rural Australia in general, this alone makes it  interesting.  I, for one, had no idea that the Aborigines were, until  recently, in a situation combining some of the worst features of Apartheid  and of what the US was doing to its Natives in the 19th century.	2000-03-04

It was a passable early book on Perl, and it isn't so bad in and of itself, but it's useless to anyone nowadays, as the really interesting material that it tries to cover is much better addressed in Conway's excellent /[[ASIN:1884777791 Object Oriented Perl]]/.<br /><br />(To be fair, chapter 20 of /Advanced Perl Programming/ is a good overview of the internals of the Perl interpreter-compiler.

It sets a new standard in how concepts of OOP should be  explained, and how they should be related to the language that the OOP  framework is implemented in.<br />And the best thing about this book is that,  on the way to explaining various OOP concepts, it manages to elucidate all  sorts of non-OOP advanced programming techniques in Perl.  So I recommend  this book to anyone who's finished /Learning Perl/ and is looking for what  to learn next.<br />It's a surprising achievement, and one that makes this  book very worthwhile reading for people who don't even particularly care  about OOP!<br />And, conversely, because /Object-Oriented Perl/ touches  on so many of the possible approaches to OOP, I think that this book would  be interesting to people who are interested in OOP, but not terribly  interested in Perl per se.<br />It is, in short, a book of immediate as well  as lasting value.	2000-03-04

Some of the music I recognize from \\"Ugly One With The Jewels\\", and some of it was even background music that Laurie Anderson did for Spalding Grey's movie \\"Swimming to Cambodia\\" (and as far as I know, no soundtrack CD was ever released of that).<br /> If you find yourself wanting to hear the music on its own, it's straightforward to sift thru the CDROM's directories, find the AIFC files (*.AIF), decompress them (easy on a Mac with SoundApp -- I don't know what you'd use for handling AIFCs on other platforms), and burn them to audio CD for your personal listening fun. Now, there's not many CDROMs where the music is so good that you'd want to do that!  But this is sure one of them.	1999-09-17

Instead, it's the author's attempts to discover and consider opinions on the purpose of college, in the minds of various kinds of people -- society at large, undergrads (both right out of high school or \\"non-traditional\\"), grad students, tenured and untenured faculty, and so on.<br /><br />The book raises many difficult questions, and points out many basic (and worsening) flaws in the US college system, flaws that are, more often than not, never raised in discussions of the system you hear elsewhere.<br /><br />Karabell's method is to answer the larger question in the title via some smaller bites at it, which you could paraphrase as \\"what's grad school for?\\", \\"what's tenure for (and why are so few people getting it)?\\", \\"what're adjuncts for (and why do they get paid slave wages)?\\", \\"what's the history department for?\\", \\"what's research for?\\", \\"what is undergrad education for?\\", etc.<br /><br />The point of this book is that the parties involved often have very different, even contradictory answers to these questions, reflecting different goals about every aspect of college in the US. The book succeeds in establishing this very important point, as well as in suggesting that the current situation requires readjustment (with there being multiple ways to readjust it, not just one big answer that'll suit everyone), so that everyone (undergrads, grad students, adjuncts, and faculty of various kinds) gets at least some of their goals fulfilled.<br /><br />There are some notable and basically inexcusable flaws to this book:<br /><br />* The question \\"what's college for?\\" immediately gets replaced by \\"what's college IN THE U.S. for?\\", as if college/university education, elsewhere, past or present, were nonexistent, or were totally irrelevant to the situation in the US.<br /><br />* The author too easily goes from observing that something is true of the discipline of history in the US (he's a history professor), to assuming it's true of all academic discplines. Sometimes this works, but often it /really really/ doesn't.<br /><br />* And there's some production problems -- lack of basic fact checking (producing no fewer than three imaginative ways to misspell \\"Cal State Northridge\\"), and an endnotes section that's unnecessarily hard to work and is riddled with stupid typos.<br /><br />But the greatest failing of this book is that it spends too much time on questions other that what I think is the most important one: what do undergrads want/expect out of college? (And to an extent, what does society want them to want from it?) Karabell doesn't /avoid/ this question by any means -- it's what the book starts out (chs 1 and 2) discussing, and what it basically ends with (ch 9). But too much of what's inbetween is too long while contributing too little to answering the larger question in the title (notably Ch 8, \\"History Standards\\", which could have been completely deleted without detracting from the rest of the book at all).<br /><br />Chapter 9, \\"Society in Higher Education\\" is so /very/ good, but so very short, that my only reaction to it was that all of the book before it should have been shelved, and replaced with more of what was in chapter 9 -- the asking of questions like: WHY do Americans think college is right for /everyone/? (In fact, do they think this?) WHY do Americans think college is necessary background for so many jobs where it's plainly not? Why do Americans get the willies at the term \\"vocational education\\", and yet flock to majors that are not basically just preparatory to the work force -- comp sci, business, accounting? Or, in fact, is this the case? I'd agree, I guess, that a business degree is basically vocational education, but is that really true of, say, comp sci degrees in general? How about medicine?

I've seen non-programmers say they didn't like this book, but that it might be good for programmers.<br />That's a bad sign.<br />Specifically, I've seen a review of this book that says \\"My only problem with [this book] is that the authors [sic] don't do a very good job of explaining OO programming to those who are unfamiliar with it.\\"<br />Well, I /am/ familiar with OOP, and I found the explanations startlingly bad. I'll pare it down to two points:<br />Point one: Chapter 1 starts out:<br />\\"What's an object? The simple definition of an object is that it is anything you want it to be. In the context of the Lingo programming environment [!], the definition could [!] be: anything you want to put into the computer's memory. In the OOPS [!] sense an object might [!] be described as an entity which can persist in time [as opposed to persisting in... space?] and can monitor and respond to complex conditions and events. These seemingly vague and indefinite descriptions of an objects are very hard to visualize and can make object-oriented programming seem to be an infuriatingly elusive concept for newcomers to wrap their minds around. The program, however, is not that it is too difficult to understand; rather the reverse, it is so ridiculously obvious and intuitive that people try to look for something more subtle and complicated in order to explain it.\\"<br />Well, you don't have to be a lexicographer to see that these are not helpful definitions, and the discombomulation that follows doesn't get any better.<br />An \\"object\\", I say, is a structure of data with which the programmer has associated certain bits of code (\\"methods\\", \\"routines\\", \\"handlers\\", whatever you call them), so that you can invoke those bits of code as actions performed on the data structure you've got at hand. An object can be a data structure representing (and corresponding to) a circle drawn on the screen; you can associate with it a bit of code that flashes any such objects. Then you can say \\"perform the action Flash on object This_Circle\\" (which may look like \\"Flash This_Circle\\", \\"This_Circle.Flash\\", or \\"This_Circle->Flash\\", depending on the language in question), and it'll do it. Tadaaa, object-oriented programming REVEALED! And I didn't even charge you $50 for that explanation. So why all the smoke and mirrors, and the scaretalk about it being too hard to be simple, and so on?<br />Now, go back to that paragraph, and replace \\"object\\" with \\"variable\\", or \\"function\\". It's basically all still true, and just as unhelpful, but obviously noone would /dare/ write an intro-to-programming text that started out that way? Feh!<br />Now, to point two:<br />There are basically two kinds of OOP systems around:<br />1) Classy OOP systems -- the kind where you have classses; every object belongs to a class; and the class is where you keep all the methods/routines that you want your objects to be capable of. 2) Classless OOP systems -- the kind of OOP system where there are NO CLASSES; you get generally get new objects by \\"cloning\\" other objects (possibly prototype objects provided for just that purpose); and methods are associated with individual objects, and are inherited by their clones/children.<br />Now, classy OOP systems are so well known that most programmers think that's /all there is/; and even people who are aware of the existence of classless OOP systems probably can't name more than three computer languages that do it that way, much less name anyone who uses any of these languages for anything.<br />Well, guess what, Lingo is a classless OOP system. That's odd, and unfamiliar, and this book should have treated this unfamiliarity with care. But:<br />If you, the reader, happen to know something about OOP, you've probably never heard of anything but classy systems, so the first thing you do when faced with a new language's OOP framework is \\"OK, how do I declare theclass, put methods in it, and instantiate/construct objects in it?\\" So you plod thru about two paragraphs of the prose I've quoted above (and there's plenty more where that came from!), you get bored, and then just go and look up \\"class\\" in the index. The /one/ entry for \\"class\\" in the index points you to /one/ paragraph, which reads: \\"[...] Some of the literature on object-oriented programming will [?] describe objects as instances of classes. This is because objects birthed from the same parent script will have a common set of characteristics which allow them to be categorized into a single class -- hence each object can be regarded as an intance of its class.\\"<br />At first sight, this makes no sense. And at second sight, it's just plain /wrong/. Classy OOP systems aren't systems where there's similar objects that just happen to be, in some Platonic abstract realm, characteristically in an thing called a \\"class\\". Instead, classes are where you get the methods that make, manipulate, and destroy objects. It's /all/ about classes.<br />I'm not harping about some minor technicality here -- this /is/ a book about OOP, and in the /single/ place in the book where an experienced programmer would jump in expected some degree of coherence, there's nothing but a wild misconstrual of basic structure of the only kind of OOP system the reader is likely to be familiar with!<br />That's bad, and it shouldn't be that way. Instead, there should be a section explaining that if you the reader have dealt with OOP systems, you've probably dealt only with (and have heard only of) classy OOP systems, but that there's such a thing as classless OOP, and so on, and so forth.<br />So in a nutshell -- this is a bad book. While reading it, I had to constantly say \\"now, here's what he's saying -- but is it really some other way, and he's just screwed /this/ up too?\\" A book that seeks to explain and to teach should do so simply and clearly; the reader should not have to constantly second-guess the explanation, and wonder why it's vague, where it's wrong, and how it's been distorted from reality.class, put methods in it, and instantiate/construct objects in it?\\" So you plod thru about two paragraphs of the prose I've quoted above (and there's plenty more where that came from!), you get bored, and then just go and look up \\"class\\" in the index.

As such, it's a must-buy for people interested in Louisiana Creole or any of the other French Creoles, Cajun, general French dialects,  or dialects of American English in general, and certainly in Southern US  dialects or Black Vernacular English.  (In fact, until someone puts this  kind of work into a Haitian lexicon, the /Dictionary of Louisiana Creole/  might have to do if you need a nice big Haitian-English-Haitian  lexicon.)<br />This lexicon uses a coherent phonemic orthography, has a wide  base of sources, and has lots and lots of example sentences (something I  always appreciate).  The lexicon deals well with lexical variation, which  is a problem area in any dictionary of Creole.  The lexicon is well printed  -- in organization of entries, choice of font faces and sizes, and in  quality of reproduction.  And, altho it's new and only time will tell, it  seems well bound.<br />The notable parts of this edition are:<br />* An about 20  page grammar sketch of the language.<br />* About ten pages on using the  dictionary, orthography, and bibliography.<br />* About 470 pages comprising  the creole lexicon.  Each entry here consists notably of the Creole  headword (and alternate forms); translation into American English;  translation into Modern French; and example sentences in Creole (each  translated into American English, but not into French).  Then if there are  subentries, those are listed too, with their own translations and examples.  There are abbreviations noting the source of the data.<br />* An  English-to-Creole index.  About 80 pages.<br />* A French-to-Creole index.  About 80 pages.	1999-05-18

However, this book what I was looking  for -- interesting reading about some advanced programming concepts that  happen to be demonstrated in Lisp.<br />This book is relatively free of any  grand agendas -- or maybe I've just gotten so used to the usual agendas in  Lisp literature that I can just ignore them.  And, well, it does  occasionally stop to remind you that Common Lisp is the best thing since  cat pyjamas and that you're wasting your time if you're using anything  else.<br />But that aside, the book does patiently develop some advanced  concepts that I'd never seen a satisfactory explanation of -- notably,  pattern matching, nondeterminism, and backtracking.  After I read that  section, I finally appreciated the implementation of regular expressions,  which I use every day.<br />The only really disparaging thing I can say about  this book is that uses Lisp macros rather a lot, where I (and I think most  readers) would have been more comfortable with pure functions.  This is an  obstacle to understanding, but I could usually get the jist of the concept  anyway, even if the example code was a bit opaque to me.	1999-05-07

No likee!) is hardly a sure route to good writing.  Superimposing a &quot;daringly experimental&quot; Faulknerian unreadability won't help either.  Nor will having one-dimensional sots for main characters.  Writers  of the future, you /can/ learn to be a good writer by reading this book!  But only by negative example.<br />In short:  /The Female Man/ is  self-important, self-indulgent, posturing, incoherent, and just plain  icky.<br />Normally I would never even bother reading a  early-1970s American  &quot;feminist&quot; SF novel blurbed as &quot;startling, outrageous, and  subversive&quot;.  However, I once heard Samuel R. Delaney say thet William  Gibson's character Molly Millions (from Neuromancer et al) was basically  lifted from just this book, from the character Jael.  I figured, if it's  got an ur-Molly in it, how bad can it be?<br />If you're thinking the same  thing, don't repeat my mistake by reading this book!<br />Here's all you need  to know about Jael:  She appears only at the very end of the book, only in  Part Eight, and in a bit or two of Part Nine.  She's only in a few dozen  (small) pages.  She's got metal claws on her fingers, and sharp steel  teeth.  She's briefly wears a mimetic suit, just like Molly in the  Sense/Net raid part of /Neuromancer/.  That's about the extent of her  relation to Molly.<br />She's from a near-future dystopia where men and women  are warring camps.  Subtle, yes?<br />We learn that she's an assasin and  something like a time-travelling (thru alternate time-lines) secret agent.  She's also an openly psychotic sadistic murderer.  (The author seems not to  consider this an ineffectual, much less implausible, mix of character  traits.)<br />She's the only remotely attention-worthy character in the book  -- and the fact she's in only the last section makes this a very end-heavy  book, altho this is the least of this book's problems.<br />And she's just not  worth the read.<br />But back to the book as a whole: I could be generous and  say that this book is &quot;dated&quot;.  However, that would imply that  once upon a time it was (and is) basically good, relevant, readable, and  interesting, but that time and change have made it a bit clunky at points  -- like /The Shape of Things to Come/ or /Foundation/.<br />However, I can't  imagine that this book was any more readable or worthwhile in 1975 than it  is now.  Incoherent is incoherent, and pretentious is pretentious, whether  it's fresh off the press, or under decades of dust.  &quot;Good&quot; can  became &quot;dated&quot;, but &quot;bad&quot; is just &quot;bad&quot;, and  life is too short for reading bad books.e's just not  worth the read.<br />But back to the book as a whole: I could be generous and  say that this book is &quot;dated&quot;.

This book is basically about using simple programs in Logo to generate natural language at various levels, mainly syntax and morphology, but also some phonology and, you could say, etymology.  There are also interesting  and often profound digressions into the history of English, various aspects  of synchronic and diachronic linguistics, and even what it means to  formulate a linguistic theory.  Parts of this book feel like a good  intro-linguistics book, parts of it feel like a jr-high or high school  intro-to-programming book, and parts of it feel like just a fun book  written by people enthusiastic about language.<br />First off, this book is  interesting and entertaining just to read on one's own.<br />Second off, this  could form the basis of a course (or part of one) in, well, exploring  language, at any level from junior high to college.  This book could just  as easily be useful for a ninth-grade computer science teacher to pull two  or three exercises out of, as it could be for someone devising a college  course based entirely around this book.<br />Now, I was somewhat surprised by  Logo having been the language chosen for this book, but: 1) it's a harmless  choice, and the code in the book is easily intelligible to people with a  programming background but no knowledge of Logo; 2) I don't consider any of  the points in the book to depend on the choice of language; and 3) any  instructor who felt the use of Logo to be problematic could easily provide  students with translations of the code into some other language, or maybe  just teach them just enough Logo to be able to read the examples.	1999-03-10

I'm giving this two stars because even in a random mess like this, some of the bits are of interest.<br />The first problem here is what a &quot;handbook&quot; should be -- a reference?  Or a survey?  If it's  supposed to be at least somewhat of a survey, as I expect, I'd expect the  classification/taxonomy/ontology to be good.  But this volume is called  &quot;Little Languages and Tools&quot;.  Well, Forth is a little language,  LOGO is a little language, most assembler languages are very little  languages, and some say Scheme is a little language -- and none of those  are in here!  If the editors were simply ontologically lazy, they should  have admitted it and just called this volume &quot;Misc/Other/Etc.&quot;<br />And what's a &quot;tool&quot;?  I recall the introduction saying  something about languages used for getting things done.  Well, I'd hope  most languages are for getting things done!  If the editors wanted to  express that a possible design goal of languages is making them concise and  simple for the most common tasks that one anticipates them being put to,  well, 1) good, I think so too, 2) they should have made this a /major/  point, not just an implicature, 3) they should have a good reason for  segregating such languages into another volume.<br />The chapter on Perl is  merely /excerpted/ from some other sparklingly mediocre book on Perl!  Why  bother??  For US$50, I don't want shovelware!<br />I'd have liked if this book  surveyed non-programming computer languages -- i.e., markup languages.  It  seems to start to, with PIC, EQN, but then remembers what it's about, and  then aborts that interesting topic.<br />The section on music languages is  not bad, since there's been little or nothing in the way of surveys of  music languages elsewhere.  The design of music languages presents special  challenges of interest to language designers as well as musicians, and this  section at least covers some of them.  Not worth the price for the rest of  the book tho.<br />The only reason this book isn't a complete waste of money,  brains, and talent, is that, despite everything, some of the details of the  languages are interesting.

US	53070033	RZX5Z043EG520	0262680823	65329046	The Computer Music Tutorial (MIT Press)	Books	5	17	23	N	N	&quot;tutorial&quot; in a sense	Just a brief note -- this isn't a &quot;tutorial&quot; in the sense that the word has taken on in computer circles in the past few years -- i.e., &quot;here's how to do some simple things without really understanding how  you're doing them, because you're too much of a doof to read the real  documentation&quot;. I say this because I don't want anyone expecting such  a thing for computer music to be disappointed by this excellent book -- so  don't expect example C code on how to parse MIDI in here!<br />However, this  is a tutorial in the older sense of being a work that aims to instruct you  in a particular subject.  And that it does very well!	1999-02-28

Surprisingly, Ms. Holzner  manages to work around that problem very well in this book.  SEVERAL  recipes in here have become consistent family favorites -- and I'm usually  surprised if I even get ONE good lasting recipe out of any cookbook.  If  this book ever comes back into print, snap up a copy, because you can't  have mine!	1998-12-06

If I'd had this in hand years ago, I'd have saved myself literally years of effort, both as far as just getting things done, but also in learning  general Perl skills.<br />You can have any other Perl book on the market, but  you're not getting the whole story until you get this one too.  This, more  than any other one Perl book, is something that can stay with you from the  time you're just starting to learn Perl, to when you're an expert at it.	1998-12-01

It's just a light little book of pleasant essays, many of them  having appeared in magazines.  I consider it the Indian equivalent of a  Molly Ivins book -- interesting and entertaining, and a delightful read to  the foreign  reader (Ivins, non-Texan; for Mehta, non-Indian).<br />The  general emotional tone of the book is very interesting -- it's the tone of  someone not exactly willing to write a rousing patriotic hymn to their  country, but yet still wanting to express quite a bit of hope about the  prospects of continued democracy there.  Frankly, that makes it refreshing  to read -- especially considering that the country is question is one that  most foreigners think of as a source for new strains of hepatitis, not  insights into the democratic process.	1998-11-22
US	53070033	R3C889QESH3KB4	0262680823	65329046	The Computer Music Tutorial (MIT Press)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Encyclopedic and Fascinating	The only thing keeping this book from being /perfect/ bedtime reading is that it's a bit hefty.  But so you'll develop strong forearms.<br />And I can honestly say this is the FIRST book I've ever seen that could serve as the textbook for a year's course on computers and music, just as well as just being an interesting on-one's-own read for the merely curious, like myself.<br />At points, this book is only detailed enough to just give you a taste of what, say, a given music computer-language looks like, so that in many ways it's /not/ a good reference (but on some subjects it is).  It reminds me of an encyclopedia, a good encyclopedia, in this way.	1998-08-04

THEN maybe get /The MIDI files/, if you feel like getting a second book.  Okay, /The MIDI Files/ is not as complete as Braut's book, but Young's more colloquial style might make for a better read.	1998-08-04

This is that kind of book -- useful for exeryone from the mildly curious, to serious MIDI developers.	1998-08-04

This is #1 on the list of books I wish I'd had from the first day I began programming. It's everything you'll ever need or want to know about REs, and then some -- and very intelligibly written, too.	1998-06-03
US	53070033	R1ZTBIIBULQ3D9	1881957322	160159527	Macperl: Power and Ease	Books	4	2	2	N	N	an indespensible book for learning and for reference	If you want to use MacPerl (the excellent port of Perl to MacOS, loaded with useful Mac-specific functions), you can do it one of two ways:<br />You can buy this book; or you you can poke around aimlessly for about two years learning, by trial and error (and guess, and crash), what is clearly laid out in this book.<br />Two years ago I was an already fairly experienced Perler, but with little experience with MacPerl.  If I'd had this book two years ago, it would have saved me more time than I really even want to admit -- weeks?  Months?<br />As MacPerl is rapidly becoming the data-conversion meta-tool, file-management language, and all-around  Swiss Army chainsaw of choice for MacOS, you can't afford not to have this book.	1998-06-02
