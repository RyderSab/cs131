The featured characters are a pair of brothers, one who fights for the Rebels and one who just wants to keep on being a farmer and not take sides.  But a Northern Major - Simmons is angry with both brothers and vows to hang them.  How they avoid this situation is something you can read for yourself when you purchase this novel. <br /> <br />West Virginia is made a state in its own right.  Now the people of the area have to choose which side they believe in - the North or the South.  The story tells of the town of Carter's Town and the people living in and around that vicinity.  Life goes on even as the war rages all around them.  Most of the people are simple farmers or miners and have never had slaves.  Those that have colored people in their households have made them freemen. <br /> <br />Births, deaths and celebrations of statehood are some of the side stories in this book, along with two female cousins who are more than what a woman in Civil War times is suppose to be.  One is a doctor and one isn't afraid to jump in and fight for what she believes is right.  The ending of the book happens just as the battle of Gettysburg is won which makes for a great jumping off point for a sequel novel.	2005-10-02

THE LINCOLN RHYME CD COLLECTION<br /><br />BY Jeffery Deaver<br /><br />PUBLISHED BY Simon & Schuster Audio<br /><br />REVIEWED BY Barbara Rhoades<br /><br />This audio book is three times as much enjoyment if you are a fan of the Lincoln Rhyme series.  It contains three of Jeffery Deaver's book:  The Coffin Dancer, The Empty Chair and The Stone Monkey.  It also has an excerpt from Mr. Deaver's newest book \\"The Twelfth Card\\".<br /><br />The Coffin Dancer:  What do you get when you cross a quadriplegic, forensic science and an apartment full of high tech equipment?  You get Lincoln Rhyme, the best detective in New York City.  And he has to face The Coffin Dancer again.  He has killed Ed Carney, husband and co-owner of Hudson Air, a small freight company.  Rhyme is called in to help the NYPD stop him.<br /><br />Rhyme forms a team of the best people, Amelia Sachs, his right-hand person, Tom, his faithful care giver, DelRay, the street hardened black cop and Mel Cooper, the best lab technician anyone could ask for.  This team has 48 hours to stop The Coffin Dancer before he kills Ed's wife, Percy and Brit, Ed's best friend.<br /><br />The Coffin Dancer is very good as he leaves no trace evidence.  So in order to catch him, they must be able to think like he does.  From an airplane blowing up to safe houses being breached to landing an airplane safely that has an altitude bomb aboard, the Dancer keeps the team on its toes.  And just to keep things interesting, Amelia and Rhyme have a romantic entanglement going!<br /><br />Joe Mantegna reads this book and has the ability to provide each character with their own voice.  A listener has no trouble knowing exactly which character is speaking.  Mr. Mantegna speaks clearly and uses inflections in all the right places.<br /><br />The Empty Chair:  Corporate greed is the theme of this story.  Garrett Handlin lost his parents and sister when he was only a child.  He begins an interest in insects to ease the pain of this loss.  Then as a teenager, he kidnaps Mary Jo and the Lydia.<br /><br />Lincoln Rhyme comes to a hospital near Tanner's Corner to have surgery in the hopes of getting more movement.  The Tanner's Corner sheriff comes begging for Rhyme's help to solve the kidnappings.  Rhyme has some time before the surgery and begins an investigation.<br /><br />Garrett is captured and Sachs believes he is innocent.  She takes matters into her own hands and breaks Garrett out of jail.  In the chase that follows, Sachs kills a deputy.<br /><br />Not until the final moments of Sachs' trial are all the facts reveled and the real culprit is known which clears Sachs of the murder charges.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna has a way with voices so you know just who is speaking.  His inflections are a perfect addition to the actual words of the story.<br /><br />The Stone Monkey:  This is a story of human smuggling and the need for political asylum.  The first few chapters are rather long and drawn out as the story is being set up.  It reminds me of the way Tom Clancy goes into great and long details of setting up a story.  After the first few chapters, the story returns to the true Lincoln Rhyme writing so being patient through them pays off as the rest of the story is great.<br /><br />\\"The Ghost\\" has smuggled in Chinese dissidents but sinks the ship and begins killing all the passengers when the NYPD shows up just before the boat makes landfall.  Between the INS, the State Department, the NYPD and a Chinese police officer, you don't know who to trust.  Lincoln uses his forensic techniques to figure out who \\"The Ghost\\" really is and prevents him from being returned to China where he would go free rather than pay for all the people he has killed.<br /><br />The secondary story is about Rhyme's upcoming surgery which Sachs doesn't want him to have.  Listen to see what his decision will be.<br /><br />The Twelfth Card:  This is a small excerpt and tells a tale of a girl in today's world wanting to learn about her slave ancestors and what happened to him.  She is reading in the History Museum when she notices she is being stalked.  She is clever and gets away but in doing so sets off the alarm.  The stalker blends into the crowd and returns to the Museum to see what the police have come up with........and this is where the CD ends.<br /><br />The Civil War history is of interest to me so I will be sure to get The Twelfth Card and finish listening to the whole story.t her slave ancestors and what happened to him.

Paul Schumann is a \\"Button Man\\" in New York City in 1936.  He gets caught while on one of his \\"jobs\\" and is offered a deal.  Since he has German ancestry, he is asked to pose as a journalist to the Summer Olympics.  But in reality, the arresting officers want him to kill Reinhardt Ernst.  In return, they will expunge his record and provide him money to start fresh.<br /><br />The deal is for Paul to travel to Germany, meet with his contacts and return to America.  But does anything ever go as planned?  Certainly not in the troubled times of the late 1930's.  First there is a spy aboard the boat.  Then the German Shupo (German Regular Police) and Kripo (German Criminal Police) get involved because a man is found murdered.  He just happens to be murdered in the spot where Paul meets his contact, Reggie Morgan.<br /><br />There is a cast of characters such as the mistress of the boarding house Paul lives in; Lisle, a waitress at the bar; Otto, a criminal that helps Paul with disguises and ability to get into areas he otherwise wouldn't be able to; and the Kripo and his assistant.  You even get to meet people involved in the Olympics such as Jesse Owens.  All is going according to plan until there is an unexpected twist.  Reggie Morgan is......well I don't want to spoil the book.  You will just have to listen to it for yourself.<br /><br />When Paul finally gets all the details in place and is ready to do the job he was sent to Germany for, yet another twist gets in the way.  This leads to an ending I never saw coming which is exactly what Jeffery Deaver is famous for - his surprising endings.<br /><br />Jefferson Mays reads the novel with clarity.  He does use a couple of different inflections for the various characters but not every character had a voice all their own.  I had to pay close attention to be sure who was speaking at times.  All in all, it was not overly hard to follow which character was speaking.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the history of this period will enjoy this audio book but even if you aren't as versed on the history, it is still time well spent listening to it.e who was speaking at times.

In 160 pages, Nora Hobbs packs a lifetime of love and adventure.  The characters were so full of life - Trevor and Kitra as well as a host of others - that I was hoping this would be a start of a series for her.  But that was not to be.<br /><br />Sky Warriors is a love and life story about the members of a rescue service based in the Denver area.  Trevor Kemper is the head of the company.  At 32, he is still unmarried and lives for the challenge of saving the lives of those in danger.  During one such mission, Trevor meets Kitra who is assisting at the Red Cross tent and serves him a meal.  Trevor immediately loses his heart to her.  She tries to avoid him and his gruff ways as she has a son with Muscular Dystrophy to care for.  But Trevor will not be denied.  He has always gotten his way and manages to hire her to assist Sandy with the communication equipment.<br /><br />After the rescue is over, they return to their base in the mountains of Colorado.  Kitra tells Trevor of her son, Johnny.  Soon the boy is living at the compound.  Due to the nature of the rescue business, they are all one big family and live with the rest of the crew such as Sandy and her husband, Flynn, Deuce, Junor and Clay.  Johnny loves flying and Trevor makes him a promise, if he works hard at his therapy and is able to walk again, he will teach him to fly.  Trevor even finds him a doctor that thinks he can make that happen.<br /><br />Kitra ex-husband has caused her be afraid of marriage but Trevor works hard to over come that and finally asks her to marry him.  As in all good love stories, she accepts and the rest of the book tells tales of rescues and life in general.  I won't give away the ending but it was sadly sweet.  If you like love stories and reading about high danger rescues, this is a book for you.	2005-07-18

There are four themes:  Classical, Ambient, Natural and Peaceful.  Each of these themes makes me think of a specific type of music.  I love Classical and nature sounds and thought these two would be similar to those types of music.  I was surprised to find this wasn't true.  The music has its basis in those themes but the music itself is not of pieces (Classical) or sounds (Natural) that I recognize.  In fact, I found the Ambient and Peaceful CD to be less than sleep inducing.  The beginning of those two CDs was of music that was droning, in my opinion.  The same sound or notes keep repeating themselves and after a couple of minutes, it became irritating to me - like a faucet that drips and you can't shut it off.<br /><br />I used the other two CDs as prescribed by turning it on as I fell asleep.  The volume was a bit hard to set - sometimes it was too loud and sometimes so soft I couldn't hear it.  This could have been my CD player but I don't think so as other CDs play fine.  I also turned it on again when I woke during the night.  The times I used the Classical and Natural CDs, I discovered in the morning that I hadn't listened to the whole CD as I did fall asleep.  Since this is what the CDs are designed to do, they work for me.	2005-07-14

Mr. Keady writes of places he has lived which provides a first-hand and accurate knowledge of the area of the country he writes about.  What was even better is that I live in the St. Louis area and have lived in the Keokuk Iowa area as well so I know the descriptions of these places  are accurate.<br /><br />The story is structured around lawyers, politics, terrorism and government secrecy.  The main character, Peter Farrell, is an attorney living in St. Louis.  He meets with a client and finds himself deep into a government conspiracy, complete with bribes and blackmail.  His brother is murdered and the frame-up makes it look like Peter is to blame.  Not knowing who to trust, Peter runs for refuge and help in the only girl he has ever loved, Sara Ahrens.  Sara believes she can help him provide the truth to the police through her father.  Belatedly, she finds out her father is a part of the conspiracy.<br /><br />The two run to a family friend of Sara's, Redwood, who has been in the political/security scene many years ago.  While the life he lives shows to the world a backwoods man, he has kept up on the technology and abilities of his past life.  This saves Peter and Sara from sure death.  Once again on the run, they end up with the President of the United States and his right-hand man.  This time, the President is killed and yet another murder is added to Peter's supposed killing spree.  Who is behind all of this?  What is the agenda of that person?  The finger points to Elias St. Armand, son of Lebanese parents, who believe his way is the only way to save the world.<br /><br />Between the political intrigue, the up-to-date scenarios of world problems and various people trying to accomplish their own agendas, Mr. Keady writes a powerful story.  It was one I didn't want to put down.  There were sections that were a bit hard for me to keep straight as I am not fully versed in today's politics and who is terrorizing who but even with that, I was able to follow the main thread of the story with no difficulty.  For anyone who knows the past history of other countries and keeps up with today's headlines, the story would be a breeze to read and understand the deeper intrigue and meaning of this first novel.  I hope Mr. Keady intends to write a second novel because he writes in a clear and easy to understand language on today's topics.I was able to follow the main thread of the story with no difficulty.

While Turning Boxes\\" didn't give me any new ideas on how to use the lathe or turning tools specifically, it was packed with many, many photos of boxes Mr. Raffan has turned.  This alone will provide me with ideas on what type of profiles to turn and should keep me busy for hours.<br /><br />The book covered how to turn threaded boxes and hit heavily on how to correctly fit a lid.  Mr. Raffan also covered hollowing on end grain which is particularly tricky.  A section on finishing gave me some ideas to ponder and the one on off-set turning creates some very unique boxes.  There is another section that describes chatter work.  And you thought that the tool chatter wouldn't be useful!<br /><br />If you are looking for a book to learn the basics of turning, I would not recommend this one but \\"Turning Wood\\" by Mr. Raffan instead.  Buy this one after you get a feel for the lathe and are looking for ideas to inspire your work such as making needles or drill cases.	2005-06-20

In reading the preface of Bucky Katt's, I learned how Darby Conley can draw such real life situations between Man, his dog and his cat.  Whenever I am in need of a laugh, I pick up this book and read for a bit.  Being an owner of two cats myself, I know that Mr. Conley writes/draws from the truth.  In our home, our cats are our \\"four-legged children\\" so I can relate to how Mr. Conley creates his wonderful cartoon strips.<br /><br />The book contains 252 pages of cartoon strips, some in color and some in black and white.  Do you own a dog and cat?  If so, you won't want to miss this book.  We will put this book on our coffee table and whenever our guests wonder if we are crazy, we can just point to yet another human that has the same type of relationship with his four-legged family members.	2005-06-17

Know someone who did or were you raised on the cooking of that era?  Then this is a cookbook for you/them!  My own mother was raised on a wheat farm in North Dakota and I recognize many of the recipes in this book.  Things like cooking with bacon grease and Applesauce Cake were among the ones I remember from my childhood.<br /><br />Then there are the recipes that today we NEVER make from scratch such as Mac and Cheese.  Doesn't everyone just grab a box of Kraft and go for it?  Well, not in this cookbook.  And you can't forget the French Toast, Peanut Butter or Chocolate Oatmeal cookies or the several varieties of soup.<br /><br />Interspersed in the recipes are stories of the author's life.  At times, it was more than I wanted to know about but by knowing I was able to understand that the recipes came from a working class family and were made by Mom.  These recipes were time and family-tested and managed to get children raised to adulthood on substantial foods even if some of the food the author wouldn't eat.  What child eats everything Mom puts on the table with relish?!?<br /><br />Even though this book only contains 88 pages, it is packed with recipes that will keep a family fed and has enough variety that even the pickiest eater can find several they will like.	2005-06-01

Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  This book, Public Enemies\\" gave me a chance to learn more about this era of our history.  It was packed with so much information that it is one audio book that I will listen to again and again in order to take in all the facts, names and timeframe described in it.<br /><br />In 1933, there was no FBI so how did this group get its start, and when it was formed, it was not a well oiled group.  They did not have guns and when they finally were allowed to, they had to be taught how to use them.  They were sloppy on surveillance and allowed the criminals to escape more than once before getting up to speed.<br /><br />What do you know of the gangsters of this era such as John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd and the Barker gang?  Did you know Ma Barker was never really a part of the gang?  Did you know that Bonnie was badly burned?  Where did the term G-Man come from?  What were the FBI's original duties and who was really responsible for all the captures?  This audio book reveals all this and more.<br /><br />Public Enemies describes a less than glamorous life that each of these groups led most of the time.  Of course, when they were flush with stolen money, life was good but as the FBI became a better working group, they caused them to run from the law and live hand-to-mouth.  The audio book also tells about who was willing to harbor them and what their favorite haunts were.<br /><br />Campbell Scott was the reader and he read well.  He did not have a lot of voice changes to denote one person from another so I had to pay close attention to what was being read so I knew who was speaking.  The introduction by author, Bryan Burrough, set up what the whole book would tell and he wrote well enough to keep me from wanting to stop the tape.  If 1933 and the gangster era holds a fascination for you, grab a copy.	2005-05-20

She arrives in the town of Alpha, California to begin again.  It is a small town that is big on historical restoration.  On the bus ride to Alpha, Nora discovers an old home for sale.  It calls out to her and she decides Alpha is as good a place as any to try to put her life back together.  As Nora was an interior decorator in ther past life, restoring an old home is something she is good at.  Luckily, she finds \\"her house\\" has not been sold and proceeds to buy it.<br /><br />Ryan Coulter is an attorney practicing in Sacramento.  He had met Nora at the bus station and gave her directions to a good motel, never thinking there would be any more contact or even a connection of any kind.  Yet there is.  The house belonged to his Grandmother.  He is a former construction worker and is glad that Nora will fix up the house.  He offers to help in the restoration.<br /><br />The town is friendly and as Nora waits to finalize her purchase, she resides at the town's Bed and Breakfast.  The owner, Imma, befriends Nora and gets her involved in the town's historical society.  The town's sheriff has his eye on Nora but she doesn't wish to be involved with a man because one had caused her a year of her life.  She wants to be friends but Tom wants more.  As sheriff, he looks into her past but doesn't discover her secret.<br /><br />The deal for purchasing the house almost falls through because of another grandson but he is unable to come up with the money needed to reclaim it.  Now that the house is hers, Nora begins the task of stripping, pealing wallpaper, cleaning brass and restoring the old house to its glory.  When she tears out one wall, she finds the Last Will of Ryan's grandmother.  Why was it put in the wall?  Nora asked Ryan's legal help to find the answers.<br /><br />Nora is almost run down in the street one day and is helped up by the neighbor's son.  She is mugged in her own home on another occasion and the third time she is able to flee to the neighbors to get help.  Why are all these things happening to Nora?  Is her ex-husband doing it to her again?  And, of course, we can't forget the ghost of Uncle Calvin who is seen by all the people who come to the house to help in the restoring process.<br /><br />Not to give away the ending but with Ryan's help, the town's good people and a diligent sheriff, all the loose ends get resolved and Nora begins to live life again.

But, in this book, it was two-thirds of the way through before it really caused me to want to stay up to finish it.<br /><br />Flight attendant, Tressa Brimmer, is in a bad relationship with her boyfriend of five years.  He is abusive and makes her dependent on him.  Tressa's sister, Flo and her husband Stan and their two children, are her refuge when boyfriend Tony becomes too much.  Ms. Hobbs took 95 of the 160 pages to set up just how mean and controlling Tony was to Tressa and how she is trying to break the hold Tony has on her.<br /><br />During these 95 pages, Tressa is required to attend an Air Safety Program on terrorism and hijacking in Orlando.  There she meets Air Marshall Seth Vandorn.  He has just ended a marriage and is not looking for another woman but Tressa catches his attention because on the flight to Orlando, he failed to keep his \\"hold\\" gun out of site.

They end up on an island and survive for four months.  Those four months are the break Tressa needs to be rid of Tony but not enough to make her completely sure of Seth's intentions as he talks of \\"fixing\\" things for his daughter.

I was not disappointed in Turning Wood by Richard Raffan.  Mr. Raffan writes with humor although what he is saying is not to be taken lightly.  He cautions again the things that can harm a new turner and even one who has worked on a lathe for years such as wrapping a rag around your fingers when applying oil to a project or an even better one:  \\"Don't work when you are tired\\".<br /><br />Turning Wood begins with an explanation of the parts of the machine and continues with the extras one could buy to enhance/make your turning easier.  He discusses chucks, drives, faceplates and adhesives.  There is even a chapter on sharpening the tools which is very important as a dull tool can get you hurt.  He also recommends getting The Complete Guide to Sharpening by Leonard Lee which I plan on purchasing.  He does speak to safety many, many times and I have to agree that this is one area that cannot be over emphasized.<br /><br />The projects offered were a Pencil Pot, a Vase and even a Lidded Box.  He does recommend \\"wasting\\" wood so you become familiar with the best way to make grooves, coves- turn your square blank to a cylinder, create your grooves, coves and bead and turn it back to a cylinder again and keep repeating until there is nothing left.  Simply stated PRACTICE, PRACTICE and more PRACTICE!  As in all woodworking, dust and wood chips are a constant.  Mr. Raffan describes how to make a Handmade Vacuum System.<br /><br />I did find several proofing errors in the book like the one on page 62:  \\"Over the years I've had four lots of stitches mending my face and forehead...\\" and a photo reference on page 14 that refers to page 65 (the actual graphic is on 67).  I also found a sentence split by the Vase project which took me a bit to figure out where the end of the sentence was.  It was four pages over.<br /><br />I thought a glossary of terms would have been useful to the novice turner.  And it would have been nice if the book were ring/wire bound as it would stay flat on my workbench so I could reference the exercises and projects as I used the lathe.<br /><br />All in all, this is one book that every beginning turner should invest in.  If you do nothing other than look at the photos and read their captions, you will get a small part of what this book is all about.  It is packed-full of all the do's and don'ts of turning wood.of terms would have been useful to the novice turner.

No need to cheat by going to the last chapter to see \\"who-done-it\\".  My only problem was even after I finished reading the book and learned all the surprising twists and turns, I still didn't know who killed Allison!  The book is well written but it was hard to follow a story in reverse order.<br /><br />Allison Pagone is an award-winning novelist with an ex-husband, Mateo, and daughter, Jessica and she is dead.  Agent Jane McCoy and her partner Owen Harrick, are working two ends against the middle to try to complete their assignment from the Bureau.  She has created a scenario that is suppose to keep everyone safe and yet stop the bad guys.  Can she juggle all the balls to make it happen?<br /><br />The story includes Sam Dillon, a lobbyist; Larry Evan, an American journalist; Ram Haroon, a Pakistani National, Irv Shiels, the SAC Officer for the Bureau; Dr. Lomas, a research scientist; Flanagan-Maxx, a pharmaceutical company and Divalpro, the blood pressure drug FM produces.<br /><br />The first 200 pages were slow reading.  Many paragraphs were repeated over and over until I thought would die of boredom if I continued to read the novel.  But I did and the last 100 pages was the best part of the whole story.  At that point, it was spell-binding reading and caused me to stay up late to finish it.<br /><br />These last chapters also were where the twists and turns were found.  Early on, I had a certain character pegged as the bad guy and I was certain that he was calling all the shots.  But, watch out, David Ellis turned the tables so fast and with such obvious clarity that I wondered why I didn't see where he was taking the story earlier on.	2005-04-25

The in-depth details reminded me of Tom Clancy's writing.  There were also a host of colorful characters -Senator Sedgewick Sexton, his daughter Rachel, Zack Herney, Gabriel Ash, William Pickering and Michael Tolland - just to name a few.<br /><br />Rachel is an intelligence analyst employed by the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office).  She has been asked by the President to help verify the authenticity of a meteorite found in the Arctic ice.  She is flown to the site and meets Michael Tolland, an oceanographer who is also there to verify the meteorite.<br /><br />The President is scheduled to break the news to the country in a news conference.  Within minutes of the conference, Rachel and Michael begin to suspect that all is not as it should be with this discovery.  They try to stop the President but are thwarted by Marjorie Tench, chief of staff.  It seems everyone wants this discover to be true; some for good and others have an agenda all their own.  To find out if the facts are true or not, Rachel, Michael and two other scientists go into the Artic landscape.  They are ambushed; one of the group is killed and the rest are left for dead.  Shifting ice saves their lives and a submarine in the Artic depths rescues them.  Armed with the knowledge that all is not right, the hunt for the truth begins in earnest.<br /><br />Who is a friend, who is a foe?  Keep listening because all is not as it seems.  There is lots of scientific gear, high tech computers secret weapons and fast-paced action to make you want to read until you figure out \\"who-done-it\\".  This reader never saw the \\"who\\" until the author revealed the answers.<br /><br />Richard Poe was well chosen as the reader of this book.  His inflections allow you to distinguish between the people speaking with little difficulty and he never sounds bored or tired of doing the reading.

Alas, it was not meant for the over 10 years of age set.  Of the twenty poems presented in the book and the one on the back cover, only five held any interest for me.  The others failed to have a poetic rhythm that I could follow.  I do believe that children between 3 and 10 would enjoy the poems more than any adult I know as they describe the Halloween experience very well.  They just don't work as poetic structure for me.  Most of the poems begin with a good cadence but lose that rhythm toward the middle to the end of the poem.<br /><br />The best part of the whole book was the illustrations; all of which are beading done on canvas.  They are colorful and realistic.  Ms. Dismukes should stop illustrating books and begin a career as a pattern maker for beading.  Any and all of these illustrations would make wonderful beading kits that would sell at such stores as Joann's or Michaels.  I hope to see Ms. Dismukes make the change from illustrating books to craft kit maker as her talents are wasted in not sharing her work with the craft industry.	2005-03-31

The Carbon 14 shows where the victims had lived but searching police files leads no where.  The police locate a home owned by Manard in Montreal and from this point, the story takes a twist I didn't see coming.  Does Ryan love Tempe?  Is the man the police talked to really Manard?

It is also a good reference/source in suggestions on which software is available, how to find it and how to use it, as well as web sites to visit.  Many times I have wanted a software but wasn't sure which one was the right one for me.  This book helps eliminate those types of questions.  I do wonder just how many parents don't know about the helpful software available or that come with the computers of today since parents are so tied to computers through work.

These are two programs that I was aware of but have never explored.  With this book as a guide, I would be willing to try them out.  The book also talks about being careful with what information you or your child provides at Internet sites.  A generation or two ago, we used a Public Library to ferret out the information.  With anything and everything being so easily found on the web, the only difference between the library and the Internet is the quickness with which the information can be obtained.  The same goes for cyber-bullying.  I grew up with a bully bothering me and the kids of today get it on the web.  Both these problems have always been with us, it is just easier with the net and something that children as well as adults need to not have in their homes.<br /><br />Mr. Johnson has provided two things I will be using in the future.  The first is how to view headers in Outlook.  I had always been able to do it in Outlook Express but when I switched to Outlook, I was lost.

What a wonderful story Fern Michaels has written in \\"Family Blessings\\".  It is so refreshing to read a novel that does NOT contain murder, sex and human degradation.<br /><br />The story is set in the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania in the days before the Thanksgiving Season.  The cast of characters is of a grandmother, son and a set of triplet grandchildren and their spouses.  Grandmother, Cisco, is the family patriarch and owns a family business of candy making.  A tornado descends on their peaceful lives and destroys not only houses but the surface peace of the family.<br /><br />Deep down, the triplets - Hannah, Sara and Sam who are all newlyweds - have never come to terms with only relying on each other.  Father, Jonathan, has never told Cisco of his true desire to work as a carpenter rather than in the family business.  Other family secrets surface when Sara and Hannah's husband's start spending nights away from home.  Sam's wife, Sonia, leaves him because of a secret she is keeping.<br /><br />Ezra, Cisco's significant other, has asked her yet again to marry him and this time she says yes.  They will be married on Christmas Day.  The big question though is can all the family secrets be brought out into the open and resolved happily in time for the wedding.

Are you a fan of magical and mystical people and places?  Then this is a story for you.  Do you have a young person in your house?  Then this is a story for them.  Imogene of the Pacific Kingdom is a story of a girl who is left with a miserly spinster aunt when she was five.  Her mother promised to come for her in five years but to a little girl that was a long time to be without her mother.  Sampson, Aunt Agnes' butler, is Imogene's saving grace.  Without him, life would be very harsh.<br /><br />Imogene is drawn to the sea.  She loves to swim.  One night after her tenth birthday, she goes to the ocean and the dolphin pendant she is wearing begins to glow.  Not to give too much of the story away, suffice it to say she finds her parents in the Pacific Kingdom, a whole new underwater world.  Since her parents are the King and Queen, she is a princess.  There are new friends to make and seahorses to ride besides just being happy to be with her parents.<br /><br />But, alas, all is not well.  Her father's brother is a threat to the Kingdom.  Imogene is not about to let anything happen to the new, wonderful life she is living.  She definitely doesn't want to return to her aunt's home.  So, between her new friends and Sampson, she sets out to rescue the Kingdom.<br /><br />This book is written for a young child but any adult who never grew up would not be bored reading it.  It is an especially good book for a parent/child reading session.  I plan to read this to my grandchildren when they come to visit.	2005-01-13

The book begins with an introduction by the author giving a synopsis of the historical period the novel is about.  There is even period music with Dulcimers and Banjos.<br /><br />Any student of history knows of Sherman's march to the sea.  Savannah is about that march and of the hardships of a city caught in the path of war.  It is set at Christmas time 1864.  The main characters are a Yankie reporter named Stephen Hopewell, a Southern plantation owner Sara Lester and her daughter, Sara's friend, Miss V and a Yankie Sargent named Winks.  These characters come together to prove that even in war and on opposite sides love conquers all.  Winks doesn't like Negros and yet saves one from drowning.  Sara, a widow, believes she should hate Yankies.  Daughter, Hattie, finds growing up doesn't stop just because a war is going on.  She even finds herself making demands of General Sherman himself.<br /><br />There were so many characters, that at times, it was hard to keep them all straight but as the novel went on, it became easier and was well worth listening to the novel.

I thought from the name that it would be about short cut keys or how-to tips on the use of Photoshop.  I was wrong.  It's all about actions - or in other words - Macros.  I think macros are a good idea but this book was beyond my ability to \\"get it\\".  I got lost in the very first chapter and from there it was down hill.<br /><br />For those more versed in Photoshop, I feel certain that this book would be a useful tool in learning how to create those actions - thus shortcuts - and saving time from doing repetitious keystrokes.  For anyone in a time crunch situation, this will be a welcome tool.<br /><br />By following the steps in Chapters 2 and 3, you will learn how to load, save, play, edit and record actions to use.  Chapter 4 discusses how actions interreact, in case you were thinking of sharing your actions with other team members who might have different versions of Photoshop or operating systems.  There is a CD included which has all 600 actions the author has so generously created and is willing to share with the reader.<br /><br />All in all, this is a book for Photoshop users who pretty well know their way around the program.

I don't find a \\"moral in the story\\" or any other redeeming qualities to recommend it to others.

It talks of \\"right of passage\\" which by the way the book ends could be true.<br /><br />To give the author his do, the writing itself was well done but the story line was little more than what you can read in the newspapers today.

I thought if the rest of the book was as intriguing as those few pages, I would not be able to put the book down until I discovered \\"Who Done It\\".  And, I was right.  I also thought the plot was going to be a simple one where the reader discovers who killed the victim.  Boy!  Was I wrong!  The plot was a spider's web of intrigue.  There was more than one murder to learn about and plenty of characters to keep you guessing on who killed who.<br /><br />The first victim was found with a knife in his back.  Between his wife, daughter, son and mother, the less than normal family was discovered.  The man's love letters were found in his library and they were not written to his wife.  Ah ha, another possible killer.  The story had dead people who are frozen into a sitting position, bright orange burial caskets, a nursing home where the patient are starting to complain about their care, seagulls, a pet dog and a few broken ribs, not to mention an ex-wife who our lead character was still on friendly terms.<br /><br />The wisecracking which ran throughout the book, reminded me of the 1940's stereotypical private eye.  It was wonderfully refreshing and gave the reader a laugh at every turn.  The lead character's job was also not one normally associated with someone who \\"snoops\\".  He was a funeral director in partnership with his Aunt.  Right up until the very last pages, I had no idea who created all the mayhem.  Oh, I had chosen early on who I thought was responsible but then I changed my mind as I read on and continued changing my mind the farther I read.<br /><br />I noted that Tim Cockey as written four other books based on the lead character.

Mr. Burke writes a story that involves many characters and many happenings and you need to pay attention to so you don't lose track of who, what, where and when things are happening.<br /><br />In The Moon of Red Ponies, Billy Bob Holland is a lawyer who gets involved in the troubles of Johnny American Horse and his girlfriend, Amber Finley.  There is a cast of players to keep straight, such as, Wyatt Dickson, Senator Findley, Darrel McComb, Greta Lundstrohm, the DA, a less than scrupulous lawyer, Seth Masterson, and Billy Bob's wife, Temple and son, Lucas.<br /><br />Johnny's cause as an activist for land preservation as well as the rights of his Native American brothers has Johnny up against those with money, power and political connections.  Johnny has past military service and that, combined with his teachings as a Native American provide plenty of tactics to keep him one step ahead of the bad guys.  Unfortunately, he has become a drunk and this makes him a good target on which to pin the break-in of a research unit.<br /><br />Wyatt has been released from jail and is back to cause trouble for the very people he was sent to jail for trying to murder - Temple Holland.  Wyatt found Jesus in jail and between that and the \\"chemical cocktails\\" he takes, he wants to help Billy Bob catch the bad guys.  Billy Bob doesn't trust him any father than he can throw him and Temple just wants him to leave them alone.<br /><br />Darrel is a good cop that had become rough around the edges and has blurred the lines between good and bad.  He gets involved with Greta who leads him down the primrose path but not quite all the way to the end before Darrell catches on to what is happening and makes a last ditch effort to prove he really is the good cop he has always been.<br /><br />The reader, Tom Stechschulte, has a voice that provides each character with its own unique inflection and tone so it is easy to know who is speaking.  James Lee Burke describes the mountains and streams; a little of the life on a reservation; and what can happen when money and greed come together.  It is a story that is involved and complex.  He leaves the story with the problems Wyatt causes unsolved - maybe so he can write a sequel?

Instead, I got a mystery that is strictly for \\"chicks\\" as any guy reading it wouldn't have a clue as to what was being said.  It was written in all the chatter of a 60's \\"Bobbie-Sox-er\\".  Since I haven't been in the 60's for 40 years, I felt it was a very dated novel.<br /><br />The main character, Bubbles Yablonsky, is the stereo-typical dumb blonde, high heel wearing with hair piled a mile high.  A former hairdresser (another stereo-typical characterization in that the only job a dumb blonde girl can hold is a hairdresser) turned newspaper reporter, Bubbles is on a case of Carol Weaver.  Carol has been sent to prison for murdering her husband.  Carol turns up at Bubbles home pleading she has been framed.  That night, Bubbles finds someone shooting at her bed.  In rushes, Bubbles wealthy, \\"hunk\\" of a boyfriend to rescue her.  Does any of this remind anyone of when women were only thought of as having to have a man to take care of her?<br /><br />I am guessing the author isn't one of those women who are as ditzy as Bubbles because she has published three other novels before this one.  The characters are corny and the story something that I think of as writing of my teenage years.  There is also slang, or I am guessing it is, that I have no understanding of.  For example, \\"You still shook up from this morning, say?\\"  What does the say mean?  Slang, I hope as it does nothing for the sentence.<br /><br />The only reason to finish reading this novel is to find out who done it and if Bubbles can actually do something adult in her life such as have a relationship with her boyfriend.  Unless you have something better to do on a cold winter's night, this is the book to read to prevent boredom.	2004-10-17

PSIT is the Psychopathological and Sociopathological Investigative Team which is a newly formed unit to handle the mindless violence of Mobile.  Bodies are turning up without their heads.

It is up to Harry and Carson to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />There is a new coroner's assistant, with a dark secret, who has Carson's attention.  She seems to be completely dedicated to her work and puts Carson in his place when he tries to make small talk.  Then add Terrence Squill to the mix.  He is Chief of Investigative Services and trying to climb the ladder to the next higher position.  He doesn't like Carson because of a previous crime Carson solved which brought him into the media notice rather than Squill.<br /><br />Carson has a family secret that he doesn't want anyone in the department to know about.  It isn't an illegal secret, just one that Carson has trouble handling.  While trying to solve the murders, this secret keeps getting in the way but in the end, helps him to solve the murders.<br /><br />Jack Kerley describes the bars and bays of Mobile with great accuracy making you feel like you are actually in these areas.  He writes with a vocabulary that makes these characters come alive in the reader's mind.  The easy flow of his story was a pleasure to read and follow.  I never had to go back to reread a section because I had missed some obtuse part - there just weren't any.  Yet, there were twists and turns you didn't expect which kept me from putting the book down.  The cast of characters were real and believable.<br /><br />I hope to see many more books from this new author.  He writes one of my favorite genres - murder mysteries.

The way is long and dangerous and Taren, the brother of Jamie's former captor, is waiting for Jamie's arrival.  It is his \\"obligation\\" to revenge his brother's death.  BUT wait......not all is as it seems.<br /><br />Taren wants \\"payment\\" for Jamie being late in arriving.  He kills Keenu's mother, which, in turn, puts Keenu's life in jeopardy as their culture believe in Transition, a time between death and burial that each family member needs to be with the deceased family member.  Leaving Keenu's father with his dead wife, the Berloff take Jamie to the Portal of Illusion and release her.  If she can find her way out, she is safe to return to wherever she wants.  But this is a place where the mind plays tricks.  Now why would he do that rather than take her life?<br /><br />The One, Keenu and the rest of the group find Keenu's father.  All return to the Elosian village to prepare for Transition except Keenu and The One.  Meeting up with Taren who has left the Berloff group, they discover just why he didn't kill Jamie.

US	52851134	RFFP8VUE1LYJI	8931435053	180419774	Photoshop CS Accelerated: A Full-Color Guide	Books	5	6	6	N	N	One of the best written books on PS	The very first thing I noticed in the book was instructions on how to install PhotoShop.  WOW!  I mean if you can't get the software installed, it doesn't matter how well written the book is!  GREAT way to start out!  The next pages gave an overview of the tools and menus and palettes available once you get PS loaded on your computer.  I have been using PS for several years now and this is the first time I have seen any author (or team of authors) bother to cover the basics.  PHOTOSHOP CS ACCELERATED has my vote for the best book around already and this is only after I read the first chapter.<br /><br />First thing I tried hard to remember was the short cut, Ctl D.  This takes the marquee lines away when you have been using the lasso or marquee tools.  It was a handy short cut for me as I was learning PhotoShop.  Ever crop a picture only to have a faint border of another color around the picture?  Try Defringe!  Never heard of it?  Look in the Layer menu under Matting.  Or have you ever wished to slim down a feature in a photo?  Try using the Move tool while holding the Alt Key.  The press the left arrow a few times - automatic diet!<br /><br />Another handy trick that was taught in the early chapters was \\"Contiguous\\".  When using the Magic Wand to select an entire background, this box should be unchecked if there is any background inside the image you want.  For example, a person has their hand on their hip, creating an area that is cut off from the rest of the background.  By having Contiguous unchecked, this are will also be selected when you use the Magic Wand.  VERY handy.<br /><br />Chapter Four teaches the Patch, Clone, Pattern and both History Brushes.  Again, these are tools I was aware of but didn't know how to use.  The chapter walks you through them in a clear and concise manner except for the Art History tool.  Those instructions confused me.  Be sure to take the time to go through the preset brushes, there are so many options.<br /><br />Do you love those old black and white photos that have just a hint of color?  Chapter 5 explains how you can create your own tinted photos.  Also in this chapter, you will learn how to put a photo into a frame that is set on an angle.  Keep reading to learn how to create Neon Lights and fireworks.<br /><br />Color correction and things like sharpening a photo, making chocolate candy look like chocolate instead of some rose color, brightening a dark photo, correcting over exposure, replacing color and several more tidbits are found in Chapter 7.  If you have trouble with the concept of layers or channels, the next two chapters are a must read.  And continuing on in the book is the chapter on Filters.  What fun these can be.  Don't forget about masks also found in Chapter 10.<br /><br />By this time, you have covered 350 pages of material on PhotoShop CS and the exercises that go with each chapter.  The CD contains the files needed to perform the exercises, along with a finished version of what each is trying to accomplish as well as a copy of PS CS and ImageReady CS.  If you have ever been frustrated with learning just what PS will do, this is the book to show you all the wonderful elements in this very extensive program.  I have been using PS for a few years and this book showed me things I never knew the program would do.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use PS but has never found the right book to help them learn it.ose old black and white photos that have just a hint of color?

From the moment I met Julia Bechtel and Noah Prine, I could actually visualize them as real people.  Although this is a fictitious story, it made me believe I could see newspaper headlines of the boating accident.<br /><br />Julia comes to Big Sawyer Island for a two week vacation but before the ferry can deliver her to the island and her aunt, there is a boating accident which kills all aboard except Julia and Noah.  Big Sawyer is a lobstering island and all the residents pull together to rescue the victims.<br /><br />Julia reviews her life.  Her husband, Monty, her daughter, Molly and her aunt, Zoey and her parents, as well as Noah Prine are all people she thinks about.  20 years with Monty has been less than fulfilling and the accident causes Julia to re-evaluate what she wants out of life.  She was spared when others weren't.  The big question that bothers her as well as Noah is WHY they were spared.  What are they to do now with their lives?  Go on as before or made changes?  And there is the question of what happened all those years ago between her mother and her aunt?  Then, Molly shows up to comfort her mother but Julia knows there is something more than comfort on Molly's mind.  Julia has to decide how she will go forward with her life.<br /><br />Being good with a camera, Julia begins taking pictures of life on Big Sawyer.  The newspaper prints them and Julie finds this rewarding.  But in the printing of these pictures comes another problem.  What is happening on Big Sawyer?  Why was Artie's boat even near the ferry to cause the accident in the first place?<br /><br />THE SUMMER I DARED tells about the changes in the lives of the islander's after such an accident and each word Ms. Delinksky writes is something I could see actually happening.  There are twists and turns that happen in lives that have been affected by the accident and realistic every day problems that are just that, REAL.  This is a well written story and one that I didn't want to stop listening to until every word had been spoken.en story and one that I didn't want to stop listening to until every word had been spoken.	2004-08-19

Sandra Brown has written a love story that is completely about two people in bed.  While she has the beginnings of a GREAT story, the focus of Words of Silk was mainly on how many times Deke and Laney could find themselves entangled in a hot passionate embrace.<br /><br />The story begins in a 10 minutes black out in an elevator in New York City.  The sparks that ignited between a very claustrophobic Laney McCloud and Deke Sargent are the makings of a story about a gentleman to the rescue of a damsel in distress.  He takes her back to his apartment to help her calm down and they end up in bed.  OK, a great way to start a romantic novel.  But for the next four and a half CDs, every other sentence is about them in bed.  There are small portions of Laney's life as a kindergarten teacher and Deke's as a lawyer but the main focus of the book was how hot they were for each other.<br /><br />I kept hoping that Ms. Brown would expand on their lives and how they worked out their two vastly different lifestyles.  I was hoping that Ms. Brown would allow Laney's character to want to find her father and expand on that subject matter.  I was hoping that Ms. Brown would expand on Deke's large family and loving chaos that goes with it.  Unfortunately, none of this happened.<br /><br />In short, this is a bedroom book and the story line goes lacking.  In Ms. Brown's book, Hello Darkness, she wrote a wonderful plot and the characters didn't find it necessary to fall into bed at every turn.  In Envy there were a few references to bedrooms scenes but there was a plot and she developed it.  Seduction by Design was a book that sounded like it would be totally involved in the bedroom but was not.  And, finally The Switch was a murder mystery involving twin sisters.  Again, none of these books involved a total commitment to sex.  I had hoped Ms. Brown would continue to write in this manner in Words of Silk but was disappointed.disappointed.	2004-08-12

Holly Latham is an heiress to the Hollander Tool fortune.  For all her money, she is a down to earth gal who cares deeply for others, especially her family.<br /><br />One glorious teenage summer decided her future, a love of old plantations and their \\"care and feeding\\".  To that end, she has almost reached her PhD but for her thesis.  She decides to combine many loves and needs into one goal.  She will write her thesis on Belle Chere whose owner just happens to be the reason for her career.  That teenage summer was spent with Lorrie Beaumont working on his Revolutionary-period estate and falling in love.  She goes after Lorrie to get him to marry her while she writes her thesis.<br /><br />Holly's love of old houses gets her into trouble before she can begin her plan.  She falls into a pit while prowling the grounds of such a house.  No one knows where she is and the walls of the pit are concrete.  What is a girl to do?  Into her life walks Nick Taggert, a wealthy doctor who has come to the area to recover from a broken engagement.  He is looking for someone to love him for him, not his money.  Nick discovers Holly in the pit, helps her get out and from there sparks fly but not those of fury.<br /><br />Nick doesn't tell Holly he's anything but the redneck she believes and Holly doesn't tell him that she is as wealthy as he and lets him believe she is a snob.  They spend one spark filled weekend together and Holly vows never to see Nick again.  But Nick has fallen in love and wants to find out if Holly feels the same.  He hires on as Holly's family gardener to be near her.<br /><br />Does Holly choose Nick's love or the wealth and old house Holly believes Lorrie has to offer her?  To find that answer, you need to listen to the audio book, \\"Holly\\".  Jude Deveraux has again written a story that you won't want to put down.	2004-08-01

It was sent to me by a girlfriend so I took the time to listen.  I have heard my husband talk about this \\"politically opposite\\" husband and wife team many times and admired their ability to make a life together when they work on such opposite sides of the political fence.<br /><br />Listening to this compilation of thoughts and desires from Mary Matalin to her daughters brought back things my mother try to pound into my head as a teenager.  From the bittersweet happenings in a teenager's life to the everyday down-to-earth, get-it-right thoughts on life, these letters provides the basics every child needs to grown up right.  They tell about the fears of being a mother and the hopes to \\"get it right\\" for your child.  They provide insights into the fact that just because a mother is now over 21, she can and does remember what it was like to be 8 or 10 or 16.<br /><br />Ms Matalin tells about her own family background and some of their hopes, dreams and family tragedies.  She shares with the listener some of those wonderful growing up stories that happen in every family and the same stories that are told and retold and handed down through the generations.  If you are looking for a good way to talk to your daughters - or sons for that matter - grab a copy of this audio book and go for it.	2004-07-27

There are plenty of screenshots to help you follow what Mr. Watrall is saying throughout the whole book.  When I first sat down to read DW MX 2004 Solutions, I thought I had a good grasp of Dreamweaver.  As a software user for over 20 years, I should have known better.  We use less than 50% of any software program's power and there is so much more we could do with any program if we only knew it was there.  This book shows you that 50%+ you never knew existed.<br />As I read the book, I started tagging pages so I could go back to my computer and test out these new to me areas.  When I finished the book, I had 24 tags placed.  I feel certain that as I continue to use these new things, there will be other ideas or questions that come up and this book will be there to help me answer them.  I plan to make this a \\"by my computer\\" book.  It will become one of my well-worn favorites.<br />To describe a few of the \\"new to me\\" items I found Flash Text and Flash Buttons.  I knew there was the Flash program to create your own but here were some ready and waiting for me to use in DW.  Jump Menus is another thing I knew about but thought I had to create from scratch.  Nope!  Right there if you only know where to look.  Did you know you could add a background to a table rather than the whole page?  I do now.  Did you ever think of printing out the site map to see exactly what you have built?  It would be helpful if you are collaborating and need to take a \\"sample\\" of the site to a meeting.  Even if you are \\"going solo\\", it would help to give you an idea of where you are at in the building process.  Finally, I think one of my favorite things is a concise definition of .jpg, .gif and .png and when and why to use each of these formats.  And don't forget, if you want a quick view of the abilities that are new in DW MX, look for the \\"Bright Eye\\" on the side of the page.<br />A CD is included with this text and has several sections.

Between the parts where you nearly roll on the floor laughing and the parts where you want to be sure you have a weapon at hand just in case the serial killer pops out of the closet, I wanted to listen to the whole audio book all at the same time.<br />Lt. Jack (short for Jacqueline) Daniels is a Violent Crimes cop who is partnered with Herb, an overweight but loveable man.  The two are on the trail of a serial killer who leaves Gingerbread Cookies as his calling card.  A mutilated body of a young woman was found in the trash bin of a corner store.  The killer is very careful not to leave trace evidence, thereby, making it hard for Jack and Herb to solve this crime.<br />Overworked, overtired and over the age of 40, Jack has her work cut out for her.  Between being shot at, stalked and her live-in boyfriend leaving her, she has insomnia.  She makes a vow, no more dead bodies.  Alas, this is not possible.  Another body is found and another Gingerbread Cookie with a note left especially for Jack.  But Jack has help in the form of an ex-partner which she doesn't want and an ex-con which gives her the lead she needs.<br />This is the first book I have listened to by J. A. Konrath and I plan to listen to more.  Mr. Konrath has the ability to pull the listener into his story so you feel like you are right at the scene.  The readers, Susie Breck and Dick Hill have the ability to make the listener feel like they are at a stage production and are actually watching what you are only listening to.  I had no trouble following which character was speaking as they made each character have his or her own special inflection.  Brillance Audio has packaged the six CDs in a box that is compact and without unnecessary extra packaging, thereby, making the price of the CD very reasonable.  Any fan of Kinsey Millhone, Stephanie Plum or Kay Scarpetta will not want to miss a Jack Daniels' story.	2004-06-22

It is read by three different people.  When I learned that, I was hesitant about listening to it.  The first reader was male and the story was about a boy growing up in a dysfunctional family.  He has to share his room with twin cousins, girls, when their father is sent to jail for stealing from his employer.  The story continues with daily life and troubles of two families sharing life under one roof.<br />When the second reader, a female, took up the story, it jumped in years and location.  The story became focused on the mother instead of continuing with the son as the first reader had.  There was no warning or lead-in to this shift in the story.  I was completely lost for the first half of a tape.  When I finally \\"caught up\\" with what was happening, I had questions about what had happened when the first reader was reading the story.  What happened to the \\"flying twin\\"?  What happened to the friction between the mother and the aunt?<br />While this is a story that ranges over three generations, the jump from one time to another with no warning really put me off.  I was no longer able to follow the story as well as I wanted.  It does show what can and does happen to people and families when one decision is made over another.  It shows how lives change by these decisions.  Unless you are good at listening \\"between the lines\\" and like stories that jump around, I would not recommend that you listen to this tape.	2004-06-15

Mixed up in the question is a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a group known as the Illuminati.  A symbolgist, Robert Langdon, is called in by a little known scientific group when one of their own is found murder with the Illuminati symbol burned on his chest and his eye missing.<br />The scientist's, daughter Vittoria, works together with Robert to undercover who murdered her father.  The trail takes them into the heart of the Catholic Church where a new pope is just being selected.  Four of the most respected cardinals are missing.  A message is received that each will be murdered.  The location of each murder is given in a cryptic message.  There is little time.  Can Robert and Vittoria stop the Illuminati?  The late pope's right hand man seems to be willing to help in any way he can.  He provides Robert access to the Vatican library where Robert finds an ancient writing that decrypts the message from the Illuminati.<br />Based in Catholic religion, Dan Brown writes so even a non-Catholic can follow along.  I thought I figured out \\"who done it\\" about five chapters before the end.  Then as I kept listening, I changed my mind.  The ending kept me in suspense right up to the VERY last words.<br />Although this a story torn between science and religion, I found some of the story to be a bit out of character for the Catholic church.  That aside, there are a couple of twists that I did not foresee until the very minute they happened.  This makes for a book that is hard to put down.  I know this was certainly true for me.<br />If you are a history buff, love suspense and like being kept on the edge of your seat, this is a book for you.	2004-05-17

That is to say, I know just enough about PS to be REALLY dangerous!  Al Ward's book, Photoshop for Right-Brainers was a JOY to read.  I was able to follow what he was talking about and even reproduce the effects using my own photos rather than the ones on the included CD.  Now THAT is a well written book when you can actually use the information on photos other than the ones provided for the tutorial.<br />One of the very first pieces of information, something that I will actually use when I work with photos, is High Pass, a filter that grays out pixels so the edge details are clear.  Two other items in PS that Mr. Ward talks about are Extract and Pattern Maker.  Extract is just what it says - taking an object and extracting or removing it from the rest of the picture.  Great way to see how you would look as a blonde!  The Pattern Maker is a tool that I will use as a web designer.  I am forever trying to find a suitable background for my web pages.  Now, thanks to Al Ward and Photoshop for Right Brainers I don't have to look, I can make my own.  Pattern Maker allows you to select part of a photo and then creates a background from the pixels selected.  VERY COOL.<br />Are you a text nut?  If so, this book shows you how to create Chrome letters.  In the same section, it shows you how to use Opacity and Fill on the text.  Of course, this can be applied to an actual photo as well but it is a very nice technique to allow the background to show through lettering.<br />A few of the other techniques this book walks you through are Masking, Cartooning images, Warping images to \\"fit\\" to another object and Photo Merge.  This last technique gives you the collage effect that allows you to create one photo from many or to blend two photos to make a panorama.  There is a CD with the book and it contains a free version of Maya 5 Personal Learning Edition, Source Files so you can follow along with the techniques being taught and Preset Tools created by Al Ward for use in the various techniques he shows.<br />This book is packed with useful information and is one that can actually be followed and understood.  Many times authors go into so much detail that you can't follow or they make it so difficult that you give up.  Not this author!

One night, she receives a call from Valentino telling Paris she is the cause of his being jilted.  He also tells her he plans on revenge by killing the girl within 72 hours.<br />Paris immediately goes to the Austin PD where Dean Mallory is called in to consult with Sergeant Curtis.  Dean is a psychologist and has a past with Paris.  Between the three of them, they must work fast to find the girl and prevent her death.  All suspicion is directed at a dentist who has a prior record for sexual misconduct.  Yet, as time goes on, they all begin to wonder if this dentist really is Valentino.  Dean's son, Gavin becomes involved in the investigation and at one point, is even a suspect.  But in the end, Gavin is the one who holds the final clue leading to the identity and capture of Valentino.<br />Victor Slezak reads \\"Hello Darkness\\" and has the voice to add the inflections and tones that give this audio book the suspense it deserves.

With today's interest in such television programs as CSI and other crime solving technique programs, this audio book \\"Death's Acre\\" will be a very popular choice of reading/listening material.  It tells the real life story of how author Patricia Cornwell's \\"The Body Farm\\" started.  The creator of \\"The Body Farm\\", Dr. Bill Bass, had no idea just how far this project would go; nor how widely known it would become.  All he wanted to do was find a few answers to questions on what happens to a body after death.<br />Dr. Bill Bass has had a long and wonderfully full life in forensic science and more specifically as a forensic anthropologist.  He is a wonderful storyteller and shares not only his work but his private life as well.  Dr. Bass relates several cases he has been involved with from a revisit of the Lindbergh baby to proving a grandfather murdered his own grandchild for money.  Each story held the attention of this reviewer and I was sad to see the audio book end.  With more than 30 years of work, I am sure there are many more cases Dr. Bass could share.<br />While bugs are not my most favorite thing to read about, I learned that they are the very things that help a forensic scientist to answer the hard questions of a crime case of when a person was murdered and how long since the untimely act occurred.  They are predictable creatures and as such, will provide the answers the scientists need to help the police in their work.<br />Learning about Dr. Bass' private life shows us he is \\"just another fellow\\" who does his work and goes home to a family.  I, for one, enjoy learning about the author's I read and Dr. Bass is willing to share his family with the reader as well as the details of his work.<br />\\"Death's Acre\\" was a hard book (audio) to put down and I was sorry to see the story end.  I would be sure to listen to another of his books when one is available.	2004-03-07

The young leader-to-be, Keenu of the Elosian race, has been sent to free his people by locating a person known as \\"The One\\".

To do so, they allow themselves to be captured by the Berloff.  Locom is suspicious of the pair and question them intently.  During Keenu's questioning, he finds a way to release Jamie from the spell of the amulet and she, in turn, finds a way to free the captives.<br />Once free, Keenu, Jamie, The One and Tony Stone, another human captive, begin the long trek back to Keenu's village.  Along the way, there are misadventures, plants and animals foreign to the humans and even another race that all try to heed their passage.  As in all good adventure stories, the group, minus one lost to death, make it back to the village but not before Keenu and Jamie find themselves attracted to each other; even if Jamie won't admit it right away.<br />Keenu's parents are not at all fond of the idea of marriage between their son and Jamie.  They are even less inclined to agree to the marriage when they discover Keenu has initiated a \\"Pledge of Honor\\" between himself and Jamie.  When they try to break the bond between the young people, it goes horribly wrong and Keenu falls into a vegetative state.<br />With so much happening, The One returns Jamie to Earth where she finds her mother has died and the police are following her because they suspect she has been abduction by aliens.

Every time I thought I had figured out how the next chapter would read, Ms. Brown took a turn in the plot that I never saw.  The book is one of her finest works.  She makes each character very believable.<br />The story begins in a publishing house in New York where the owner's  daughter, Maris Matherly-Reed, is an editor with an eye for a great story.  She gets one in a partially written manuscript.  The only problem is the author is only identified by three initials and has given a return address of a small Georgia-Coast island.  This story has intrigued her enough that she discusses the writing with her father, Daniel.  He encourages her to seek out the author and so she goes on a search to the island seeking this unknown author.<br />When Maris finds the author, Parker Evans, she is surprised to find him in a wheelchair.  Getting him to finish writing the story takes all her skills as an editor or so she believes.  Slowly, as she reads a chapter or two at a time, a story about two college roommates, each of whom wants to be the first published author starts to unfold.  The more she reads, the more she begins to think this is not the fiction Parker tells her it is.<br />As Maris travels between the island and New York, she begins to find out things about her husband that distress her.  Things like his adultery and she begins to wonder to whom she is really married.  Her husband, Noah Reed is co-publisher in Matherly Press but has ambitions far beyond his present position.  He is ruthless enough to do anything to get it and has a past that Maris knows nothing about.  Slowly the pieces begin to fall into place and Maris discovers a love she thought she already had.<br />Right up to the very last paragraphs of the book, the reader thinks they know the ending but Ms. Brown has one more turn of events to give to the reader.  ENVY is a book that not even the best sleuth will see the final ending until the final words have been listened to.al words have been listened to.	2003-12-10

I was very disappointed.  As someone who has used Word, Excel and PowerPoint for the better part of 20 years, it offered me nothing new.  And considering I never use Outlook, there was nothing there for me either.<br />On the other hand, if you are just beginning to learn these programs, this is a MUCH easier read than the technical manuals that comes with the software package.  561 pages cover everything you could possibly want to know about these four programs.  A 24 page Index and a 26 page Content Section give you plenty of options on how to look up things which makes it much easier that trying to find something in the Yellow Pages.  The whole book is written in a lighthearted manner which makes it easy to read.<br />The book is laid out in Parts.  Each part covers a particular program - Part 1 - Word, Part 2 - Excel, etc.  Inside each part are chapters.  The beginning of each chapter describes in an outline form what is found in that chapter so you don't have to hunt through the whole book to find what you want to do.  There are graphics showing what the author is talking about and boxes which give great tips.  There are even specially marked sections (with a little \\"Batman\\" figure!) with even more tips.<br />For those of you needing a helping hand on Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Outlook, this is the book that will help you achieve your goals.  Whether it is creating a manuscript, planning a financial sheet, creating a slide show, keeping track of your daily activities or just simply sending email, Dan Gookin's NAKED OFFICE is the book to read.	2003-11-05

It also tells about using your camera as a \\"notepad\\" for such things as remembering a quote in a book or showing your spouse several outfits you might buy but couldn't decide which one.<br />Chapter 10 tells all about the items you can create from the photos you take with the digital camera.

There are links to other sites giving the reader more information about digital photography and the site also has a gallery of the author's work but not much more.<br />I would not recommend this book to the beginning digital photographer.  It is written more for the photographer that already knows a few things about digital cameras and how they work and even leans towards those who might be or plan to become a professional photographer.  I believe photographs are a basic part of what should be included in this type of book in order to provide a good insight into photography.  Unfortunately, this book has less photos showing what is being discussed and is more dependent on the written word.  It does provide notes in vivid green boxes and other types of tips in soft blue one throughout the book but, alas, not much in the way of photographs.<br />The author, Mikkel Aaland, describes features and accessories available on cameras and some software solutions for cropping or changing things in the photos.  He also talks about lighting, how to work with different subjects to get the best shot and problems like camera lag or bad weather and how it affects your photos.  He shows what equipment it would need to set up a portable studio and continues on with the process of making a mini-movie and how to create a collage.<br />He has a chapter on photography while on the road.  Some things he reminds us to consider are the cold, heat and humidity and what is can do to your camera and the picture subjects.  Another thing to consider while moving about with your camera is the proper way to pack it and the accessories so they are not damaged.<br />Several chapters remind us to think about lighting over and over again.  This must be something the author thinks is the making or breaking point for taking pictures.  He continues with how to get great landscapes or photographing that new living room you just redecorated.  He warns us to think about scale and depth of field.  While in Chapter 9, he discusses the panoramic shots and those great virtual homes tours now available on the web.<br />Chapter 10 talks about software programs and a basic studio.  It tells us that software can allow the photographer to take a less than perfect shot and correct the imperfections with the software. In other words, grab that picture that is one you really want even if it isn't set just exactly right.  The wonders of the digital age will help you overcome the problems.  Mr. Aaland also touches on composition and how to photograph flat objects.<br />Chapter 11 continues the digital camera uses by discussing shooting underwater, in the sky and even at night.  A few accessories will be necessary for underwater shooting such as an aquapac.  Think you need an airplane to get those aerial views?  Think again!  Remember Ben Franklin and his kite?  Well, you can use one to get the aerial shot you want.  Yes, it takes a bit of practice but what doesn't?<br />Chapter 12 talks of what to do now that you have taken the picture.  Do you want to print it on paper or share them with friends online?  There are many ways to do this such as the Kodak Picture Maker Print Station, a desktop printer or online photo services like shutterfly.com or snapfish.com.  And, of course, there is more software available to help you save your photos and download your camera to your computer.  The final chapter gives an in-depth description of RAW, describes the Histogram and white balance.<br />All in all, Shooting Digital by Mikkel Aaland, will give you many suggestions on how to improve your photos, the equipment that is available along with the accessories and what to do with the pictures once you have taken them.  It is a book that will involve time in reading but could help you will end up with a more professionalviewpoint on digital camera photography.viewpoint on digital camera photography.	2003-09-26

Even though this book is written for the photographer using a digital camera, someone using one with film would get some great tips on how to take better pictures.  The Introduction chapter has 23 pages explaining the terms used in digital photography from CCD - Charge-Coupled Device - to a comparison chart of the pros and cons between a digital camera and ones that use film.  This chapter also contains all the accessories that are available as add-ons to digital cameras.<br />The size of the book is easy to take along in a camera bag at approximately 7\\" square.  The inside of the cover has a bend over that acts as a bookmark and, of course, there are lots of photos to show what is being described.<br />Do you know how much light you should have in a picture or how to set up the best shot?  These are some of the things Chapter 1 has to offer.  It also talks about the basics, a good place to start in a new hobby.  Such things as keeping the lens clean, preventing shake and blurring, how to hold the camera and stance, and using a tripod or other objects for support are described.  Image size, the quality of the photo, using the focus lock and different type of lenses are discussed as well.<br />Chapter 2 provides more information on lighting your pictures as well as other things you need to consider when taking photos such as weather, time of day and when and how to use a flash.  Remember those old photos that your grandmother had that were that weird brown color?  It is called sepia and Chapter 2 tells you how to achieve such pictures with your digital camera.  And what about those really close up pictures of such things as flowers or a butterfly?  Do you know what white balance is or what is does for your pictures?  How is a continuous shot accomplished?  These questions are answered in Chapter 2.<br />Chapter 3 is all about shooting people.  Things like close ups, backgrounds, groups of people, camera angle, and filters are all things that are necessary to think about when working with people as your photo subject.  How do you get children to be good subject matter?  What do I do if I want a self-portrait and how do I do it?  Check out this chapter for the answers.<br />We all love those wonderful countryside pictures of fall trees and waterfalls or that special place we want to remember from our once in a lifetime trip.  Chapter 4 talks about the people, places and things that will keep our memories of this trip and the best way to save them in print.  But the weather is not always sunny, what happens when it rains or snows or after the sun has set?  Several pages have suggestions on how to handle these quirks.<br />Angle, composition, light and exposure are all things that need to be thought about in order to achieve good photos as well as distortion, glare, reflection and use of a tripod.  Chapter 5 explains these and the use of a computer program called PhotoStitch to create a panoramic shot.  Did you know your digital camera is able to make movies?  No, then read on in Chapter 5 for the how-to of doing this.<br />The final chapter tells what you can do with the photos now that you have taken them.  You have the pictures on the camera, what is the next step?  There is that weird name your camera gives each picture.  Will you remember even by the next day what picture 000046.jpg is all about?  Most of us won't so they need to be renamed for easier organization. What are the different ways of getting your pictures from the computer and into a printed format?  What type of computer programs are available for manipulating the photos - from just getting them from the camera into the computer to making color corrections or even doing some cropping?  Can you put your photos onto the web so they can be shared with others?  Reading this last chapter will answer all of these questions.<br />Finally, 40 Digital Photography Techniques comes with a CD loaded with helpful software.

I have always been a fan of the TV series \\"Spenser for Hire\\" and listening to Joe Mantegna read Mr. Parker's work is one of the best combinations of reader and writer I have listened to in a long time.<br />Spenser has been hired to find out who murdered Mary Lou Buckman's husband in the wealthy desert town of Potshot.  It is believed that a gang of misfits called The Dell is responsible but the more Spenser looks into it, the less he believes this to be true.  Also, there are ties between The Dell, the murder and several people of the town's citizens.  Is the sheriff really a good guy, what's the real estate agent up to, and what is a movie producer doing in this small town?<br />A group of the Potshot's leaders comes to Spenser and asks him to rid them of The Dell.  In order to this, Spenser hires several of his own thugs.  Each has his own special personality; - a Mexican, a gay, a Native American and of course, Spenser's favorite partner, Hawk, along with several others who have mob connections.  Mr. Mantegna has the ability to give each character his own voice so the listener has no trouble knowing who is speaking.  Spenser's long time squeeze, Suzanne is more than a little worried as he begins this case.<br />Mr. Parker's tells of the desert heat and makes it feel real.  He paints a picture in words of the mountains and the people and the listener can visualize them in his/her mind from his well written descriptions.  He has created each character in such a way that makes you think you might know a person like that.<br />The final chapter brings everything to a close but not in the way a reader might expect.  Potshot is a story that is hard to put down until the reader finishes the book.	2003-09-13

He had the ability and ambition to change his fortunes and develop the circumstances that he found himself in.  He had the ability to compromise, change and accept what, at the time he lived, might have been slightly less than his immediate goal.  He developed within the confines of his time, a life that was riche and diversified while maintaining his basic principles.<br />An example of this is his carting his printing materials to his shop to show the towns people that he was very industrious.  This act alone was not a necessary component of his success.  His development of friendships and relationships that lasted throughout his life allowed him to grow as a person and helped as he became involved in the development of this republic, both here and abroad.  Some of these relationships became estranged, thus creating some personal pain, the main one which was his relationship with his illegitimate son.<br />I particularly liked the last segments where the author was comparing comments made by various other authors on Ben Franklin's life.  It was interesting to see how they have changed from less flattering to more flattering over time.<br />The reader, Boyd Gaines, maintained an excellent pace and was easy to listen to.  Something that I might criticize is, and it is really just a minor point, is his trying to use various accents to differentiate the characters.  It did create the affect he was trying to achieve but at times it was distracting.  I have listened to this book twice and will do so again.  It is one that should be in your collection even if you are not a history buff.	2003-08-26

The first is the Genesis Force itself, which we first saw in the Original Star Trek Series, and anyone who follows the Trek series know this creates life from nothing.  When it hits planet after planet where there is life, it destroys.  Who unleashed this terrible force?<br />The Federation is looking into putting a stop to the Genesis Force doing any more damage while the Klingons go to the planet to try to help.  In attempting to do so, they come up against a race whose scientific community wants to change the way their planet is ruled.  So along with trying to reestablish life on the planet, they are up against a governmental overthrow.<br />The characters are very colorful from the ruling family to the Klingons and right down to the young scoundrel that ends up being the ruler of the new world as the story comes to an end.  It tells of the murder of the ruler and the creatures created by the Genesis Force as well as the atmospheric conditions that must be fought in order to regain control of the planet and make it habitable again.  There is even time in the book for a bit of a love interest between Geordi and Lea Brahms who we have seen in earlier stories of Star Trek.  In the final attempt by the scientific community to create the same wonderful place they had before Genesis Force, they unleash a new force into the atmosphere on their devastated planet.  The result is anything but what they wanted to create.<br />Tim Russ is the reader of this audio book.  He reads the story with the fervor that only a person who has actually been a part of the Star Trek Series could give the book.  He is able to inflect the words almost as perfectly as the character that played the original role.  This is a must have for any Star Trek fan.	2003-08-26

I have read several of Kathy Reichs' books featuring Tempe Brennan and was thoroughly enthralled with them.  So, I expected Bare Bones to follow in this same pattern.  After listening to the first tape, I was read to give up.  These chapters contained lots of what I thought was unrelated information.  What I found out by listening to the whole book was that this was, in my opinion, extraneous detail.<br />The remains of a newborn was found in a wood stove and I thought the book was off and running in the \\"keeping a reader on the edge\\" style in which Ms. Reichs usually writes.  Then came details about a bear bone find with more detail than I thought necessary to the rest of the book.  Yet, it did have to do with the story line but the time spent reading about them was in such a large quantity that I was ready to not finish the book.<br />I continued on though and was glad I did.  After the first tape, the story continued the budding relationship between Andrew Ryan and Tempe and all the regular characters were there, Boyd, the dog; Katy, Tempe's daughter; and, of course, Birdie, the cat cannot be forgotten.<br />A plane crashes in the mountains and burns causing the bodies to be unrecognizable.  Bones are discovered at a Charlotte farm.  With these happenings, a story begins that kept me interested in finishing the book.  It tells a tale of what people will do to each other and for money.  The reader needs to pay close attention to all the characters.  They are all tied together but in such a way that if the reader loses track of who's who, confusion will set in.  There are many more people to keep straight than normal in a book from Kathy Reichs.  Once again, Tempe's abilities as a forensic anthropologist are needed to solve these puzzling and intertwined mysteries.  The medical details are great and given in enough detail as to make the book interesting but not detailed enough to be gruesome.<br />The ending has a twist that I did not see coming but tied the book all together which is what a great book is suppose to do.

If it has a trial version of the software the book is about, it is one I would think of buying.  Fundamental Web Design and Development Skills has such a CD and it contains Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX, Flash MX and Fireworks MX.  Anyone buying this book is off to a flying start with these programs available to them<br />Next I check out the Contents section.  Fundamental Web Design has 16 Chapters and the titles of the Chapters make real sense.  A reader would know where to look for a specific item.  Then I look at the Index which, of course, is another version of the Contents but gives a more in-depth listing.  There are 28 pages of information located here.  Between the Contents and the Index, no reader should have to wonder where to go to find the information he/she wants.<br />In reading the book, the chapters give a good explanation of what the chapter is about.  It doesn't skimp on explaining what HTML or XHTML is but it also doesn't go overboard to the point of boring a reader or giving extraneous information.  The chapters contain visual examples of what is being discussed and each chapter ends in a summary of that chapter.<br />This is a book I wish I had known about when I was beginning to learn Web Designing.  I would have been able to \\"test-drive\\" the software and would have bought these programs to begin with rather than going through different software first.  The CD also contains all the files needed to work through what the chapters are teaching and as it says on the CD, there is \\"an extensive list of links to provide you with further reading and material to compliment the wealth of knowledge already contained within this book.......\\"arranged into categories for easy reference.<br />I would highly recommend Fundamental Web Design and Development Skills to anyone even if you already have some knowledge of web design.  Why the writing in this book so understandable may be due to the fact that two of the three authors of this book are women and the only man has interests in art and literature, is a cat lover and has worked with a baby in his lap.nce.<br />I would highly recommend Fundamental Web Design and Development Skills to anyone even if you already have some knowledge of web design.

Then, whether or not the CD has trial versions of the software the book is written about.  In the case of MASTERING DREAMWEAVER MS DATABASES, both are true.  The CD contains ColdFusion MX, Dreamweaver MX, Fireworks MX, Flash MX JRun4 as well as the files to work through the material given in the chapters.<br />The next thing I check out is the Contents and Index.  Is it written in a manner that allows a reader to locate a specific topic with ease?  The Contents of Mastering Dreamweaver MX Databases has two Contents sections.  The first is \\"At a Glance\\" and the second is the more detailed version.  The Index has 35 pages of information.  Both the Contents and Index are written in enough detail to allow the reader to find what they are looking for.<br />Each chapter ends with a summary of what the reader should have learned in that chapter.  The chapters themselves have very few graphics and lots of technical reading.  Before buying this book, the reader should be fairly well versed on HTML and Javascript.  If things like ColdFusion, JavaSever Pages, PHP and Oracle mean something to you, then this book is at your level of understanding.<br />MASTERING DREAMWEAVER MC DATABASES is a good technical manual for intermediate to upper level of knowledge about web design.  Along with having a very good CD, this book will boost your knowledge on how to handle the upper end of web design.	2003-03-04

BUT, I am glad I did read it.  The story is about an \\"everyday\\" family who faced World War II and is written in a \\"flash-back\\" fashion.  The story begins with the death of the family patriarch and war veteran, \\"Lucky\\" Jaggers.<br />After the funeral, the oldest son, Rob, finds a diary of his father's and reads it.  This gives him an insight into a side of his father he never knew existed.  The diary tells about Lucky's time in the 10th Mountain Division serving in the Italian Alps during the War.  Along with the diary, there is a crayon drawing spattered with blood and a German Luger.  What are these mementos all about?<br />Along with Rob, Jolene - Lucky's wife, Alana - the only daughter, and Ed - the youngest son are struggling to put there feelings about their husband/father respectively in order.  Rob encourages each of his siblings to read the diary.  Ed does but Alana resists.<br />One night while watching movies on TV, the children learn of the terrible ordeal their mother went through and by telling her children about it starts the healing process for Jolene.  This brings Alana closer to her mother and begins the healing process for her.  Ed and Rob begin to heal as well after they have read the diary.<br />I have a love of history but find most historical books to be very dry and uninteresting to read.  \\"My Father's Eye's\\" gave me a way to remember the history of World War II by telling about a family and how it affected them.  The final two pages of the book provide a definition of some terms used in the writing of the story.  This provides a nice reference for anyone who might not know their meaning otherwise.  I wish I had known it was there before I started reading.  Maybe the next addition will put this wonderful reference in the front instead or at least a note that it is in the back.<br />Learn about the 10th Mountain Division of World War II by adding \\"My Father's Eyes\\" to your library today.at least a note that it is in the back.<br />Learn about the 10th Mountain Division of World War II by adding \\"My Father's Eyes\\" to your library today.	2002-12-09

This time Tempe is in Guatemala to investigate what happened at Chupan Ya.  While this is where the story starts, there are many side stories in \\"Grave Secrets\\".  The listener needs to pay attention to every detail or he/she will lose track of what is going on.  The atrocities that were inflicted on the women and children of this village by soldiers are unthinkable.  The people of the village want to know if any of the victims are their family members.<br />Ms. Reichs also give extremely detailed forensic information in this book.  Her others books with Tempe as the character have given forensic information but this time, she has given much more intense descriptions of the workings of forensic anthropology.  These details make for added realism.<br />One of the side stories concerns the disappearance of an ambassador's daughter along with three other girls.  Remains are found in a septic tank and Tempe just happens to be an expert in recovering remains from such a place.<br />Another story is about the killing of one and the wounding of another of Tempe's colleagues on the Chupan Ya diggings.  Then, of course, Andrew Ryan is a part of the story as Tempe's love interest.  Then to make matters all the more juicy, Bartolom&eacute; Galiano, a Guatemalan investigator, becomes yet another love interest who just happens to have gone to school with Andrew and is looking into the disappearance of the girls.<br />Do any of these stories tie together?  Do they all tie together?  To get the answer, read \\"Grave Secrets\\".	2002-11-20

It contains 18 programs!  WOW!  Most are trials but some are shareware and the biggest plus is that PhotoDeluxe from Adobe is FREE!  Yes sir!  The whole program on the CD - no cost whatsoever and the programs are as follows:  PhotoDeluxe, Photo Elements, Funhouse, Flip Album, Thumbs Up, CompUpick Pro, DVD PictureShow, GIF Animator, Genuine Fractuals PrintPro,HotText, Still Motion Creator, PhotoPrinter, PhotoImpact, PhotoVista Link, PaintShop Pro, Orasee Link, Nero Burning ROM, and JPEG Compress.<br />For the ability to try before you buy any of these programs, except, of course, PhotoDeluxe, this makes the book worth its price.  Yet, by using these programs and using the tips and ideas from the book, you can create pictures that are worth a thousand words.<br />The best place to start is at the beginning and that is exactly what Ms. Sadun has done.  Chapter one talks about the best way to get a good picture such as lighting and backgrounds.  If you don't know which camera to buy in the first place, the next chapter will give you some good advice.  Also, think your camera is only for picture taking?  WRONG again.  Ever go into the mall only to come out and you can't remember where you parked?  Had you had your digital camera alone, you could have taken a picture of the locator markings and all you would need to do is look at the \\"review pictures\\" on the camera.  Of course we all know the camera can be used for insurance purposes of accidents and the damage done but what about witnesses or even what was said if your camera has a sound-recording feature?<br />What else is your camera good for?  Need stickers or how about a jigsaw puzzle to keep a child busy?  Remember \\"Shrinky Dinks\\"?  This can be used to make charms for a bracelet from photos you have taken.  What grandmother wouldn't want one of a monthly recording of their newest grandchild?  This list can be endless - just use your imagination.<br />Now that you have PhotoDeluxe installed on your computer, do you know how to use it?  If not, check out Chapter 3 and 4.  When a particular photo effect is discussed, there are pictures of before and after of how they should look.

How many books have been written to go through all the steps of putting together a web site?<br />Making the Web Work, Designing Effective Web Applications is another one of those books that describe the steps to building a web site.

What if you were color-blind?  How would that wonderful page you just created in the latest colors for this year look to you?  Or how about that Flash page your spent hours creating music clips for, sound if you were hard of hearing or deaf?<br />Most web designers never think about those with handicaps although they should.  Among the handicaps web designers need to think about when designing are those with limited mobility, learning disabilities such as Dyslexia, the blind or low vision, and of course the hard of hearing or deaf.<br />Our televisions have closed caption so why not a web site?  As for color, most people with color blindness see blues and browns.  Do you as a web designer remember to use alt texts on every image?  Just how many links does it take to navigate to something on your site?  Have you ever used a screen reader?  How many times have you used a Reset button on a form?<br />All of these things and more can be explored in Building Accessible Websites\\".  Even the CD thinks about accessibility - the whole book can be read on the computer!  Finally, there is an appendix on accessibility and the legal aspects a designer needs to know.  If you are truly building web sites for the future, this book will help you make sure everyone can use the site.	2002-10-29

It was very hard to stop the cassette because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  If Mr. Thor's next book, The Path of the Assassin due out in January of 2003, is as good as The Lions of Lucerne was, he has on very happy new fan.<br />The Presidential Secret Service detail, with ex-Navy SEAL Scott Harvath as the lead agent, has the job of guarding the President and his daughter while they have a ski vacation in Utah.  Unfortunately, every agent is killed except Scott and the President is kidnapped.  To make things worse, Scott is framed for the murders of the agents.<br />He flees to Switzerland to find the answers and discovers help in a beautiful Swiss Federal Attorney.  Between the two of them, they fight to save the life of the President as well as their own.  Discovering that some of the highest officials in the government are involved only makes that job all the more difficult.<br />Brad Thor writes with wonderful descriptive narration and up-to-date technical knowledge regarding weapons and mercenary tactics.  He writes with the Nation's current terrorist threats in mind.  If intrigue, suspense and \\"on the edge of your seat\\" reading is on your favorite reading list, be sure to get The Lions of Lucerne.	2002-10-06

She has bought her ancestral home in New Jersey.  The former owners were installing a pool.  Emily really doesn't want it but feels it will be a place for fun when her brothers and families come to visit.  During the digging, a grave is found of a young woman missing for four years.  In her hand, an heirloom of Emily's ancestor is found - a Shapley family ring.  This ring turns out to belong to Madeline Shapley, Emily's ancestor who was also missing over 100 years ago.<br />Emily has recently been a victim of a stalker who is in jail.  A friend installed cameras in her house and the police were able to catch the stalker.  Now with the grave being found in her own backyard, Emily is understandably upset all over again.<br />Between the New Jersey police, a lawyer who helped her close on her house, the former police on the stalker case, her friend who installed the cameras and her soon to be new employer, Emily believes she has all the help she needs.  In trying to figure out the history of the missing victims, Emily puts herself square in the middle of the problem.<br />This is a wonderful story full of history, family ties and long forgotten secrets.  It was a hard book to stop listening to until the surprise ending.	2002-09-25

Holzschlag<br />PUBLISHER:  New Riders<br />REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<br />BOOK REVIEW:  Remember 10 years ago when web designing was a one-man (or woman as the case may be) job?  If so, this is the book to bring you up-to-date.  The first three chapters give you an overview of where the web has been and where it is going in the future and how to get on the bandwagon to get there.<br />Color, space, shape and type each have a chapter on how each of these items should be handled in the web of the future.  There is a chapter about XHTML-style and it is compared to the game of Jenga.  And would a web design book be complete without a chapter on CSS?  Of course not and this book has one which gives the reader information on how to do CSS layouts.  The tips section can be found on the edge of the various chapter pages and contain some very good resources complete with the URL.<br />The final chapters talk about Flash, SVG and SMIL.  If you don't know what these are, (and the author is not talking about the program FLASH!) then you better get this book and read up on it.  In less than 200 pages, the author has packed a huge amount of information to help the reader get their web designs up-to-date.  Be sure to get a copy for your use.	2002-09-25

It has many features allowing web designers/developers to use video, multimedia, and application development when creating interfaces or e-learning courses or even advertising.  The CD included with this book contains a trial version of Flash MX and each chapter's files allowing the reader to refer to what the text says.<br />The first three chapters give an in-depth look at what is Motion Graphics, the process of digitalizing video taken with a camcorder and how to add sound to that video.  Other chapters discuss masks, text animation and there is even one chapter showing the website of a TV designer.<br />The book is well laid out with step-by-step instructions on how to do what the chapter is talking about.  There is plenty of color as each chapter has a different color for its pages, the graphic displays are easy to see and there are plenty of them.<br />With Flash being such a varied product, this book covers only one small portion of what this program can do.  For the [$$$] price, you get only a small part of what it does.  If that is the thing you want concentrate on doing with Flash, pick up a copy.	2002-09-17

This book was supposed to have been about a girl being killed and the person that the police believe is the suspect.  The author even takes the time to do his own introduction.  Mr. Burke talked about the Cajun life and music.  It was wonderful to hear his thoughts on this and I thought he would add a bit of this local color to his story.  I was very excited to begin listening to the story.<br />I was all set to listen to a GREAT book on Southern life and the murder of this poor girl.  ...

Coming in a close second, are ones called Case Studies that also contain very useful information such as web-safe palette, style sheets. Quick Time, page loading, Flash, sound loops seamless transitions and pre-loading and layers.  The Case Studies Chapters end with a Summary of the chapter and URLS used.<br />The format of the book has highlighted boxes with tips and notes, the same as many web specific book formats are using.  There are graphics through out the book to show examples of those subjects being discussed.<br />Many of the chapters were done in a question and answer format and were specific to the people being interviewed.  It seemed more like a promotional piece for their shop than an instructional book on HTML and Web Artistry.  Granted, you can always get a bit of information by reading what others have done but this wasn't what the title of this book lead one to believe it would be.<br />The two reference chapters and these Case Studies make this a viable book from which to learn something.	2002-08-15

Each is given half of one page so the information is in concise form.  You won't have to read a chapter to find out how to do the tip.  Also, each tip contains at least one graphic to visually explain what is going on.<br />The down side of this book is the way the Chapters are named and the tips indexed.  If you are looking for a specific topic, you better know how the authors think because the Chapters have such names as Greased Lightnin' and Fast &amp; Furious.  While these names are cute, they do nothing to help a reader locate what they need.<br />Also the names of each tip in the Chapters are not listed in alphabetical order.  For example, the first tip in Chapter 5, Fast &amp; Furious is Zoom Out for Sharper Web Images and the second to last is Exercising Your Influence on GIFs.  Neither Zoom or Exercising tells you what the tip is about; you have to read the whole name.  So even if they were in alphabetical order, it wouldn't help.<br />The bottom line:  Get the book if you want to do some reading to locate your needs.  It has all kinds of wonderful tips; it is just not labeled well.	2002-08-12

If so, you don't want to miss the book, The Empty Chair.  In this story, Lincoln has decided to have surgery performed that may give him more movement.  When Lincoln and Amelia, his right-hand gal and soul mate, arrive at the University of North Carolina, they are asked by the sheriff of Tanner's Corner to help them locate two girls that have been abducted.<br />Putting aside his need to be ready for the surgery, Lincoln agrees to help.  Between them, they determine that the Insect Boy is the culprit but when he is apprehended, he refuses to tell where one of the girls is being held.  Amelia begins to believe Garrett, AKA the Insert boy, is not guilty.  Lincoln disagrees.  Pitting their wits against each other, each tries to prove he is right.<br />Mr. Deaver's writes with a knowledge of local color that is superb and keeps the reader on the edge of his chair until the last word is read.  He also gives the plot several unexpected twists that add to the story.  Be sure to get a copy for yourself.	2002-08-08

Unfortunately, Dearbhla Molloy, the reader of My Dream Of You, is so good at English and Irish accents that it is extremely hard to hear the words if you are not able to understand these accents to begin with.  In fact, she was so good that after listening to one side of the tape, I gave up.<br />The other draw back to this story was that the first half of the tape was spent in such detailed background information that it did not hold my attention.  At this point, between not being able to understand what was being read and the drudgery of the detailed background, I lost interest in reading any more.<br />The story, as outlined on the back cover, seemed like it would be a good one.  It was about an affair between an Irish servant and the wife of an English landlord.  If you can get around the accents and the laborious details in the beginning, this may be a good book.	2002-08-07

Besides the normal formatting of notes and tips in yellow throughout the book, the first chapter shows how to set up all the equipment you will need.  The first program needed is Virtual Dub - [...]  This program captures video images and has other useful functions<br />Movie Xone is a program for proper video editing and can be found at [...]  You will now be working in what is known as an animation by dragging different clips onto a storyboard.

SON OF WEB PAGES THAT SUCK<br />AUTHOR:  Vincent Flanders with Dean Peters and a Cast of Hundreds<br />PUBLISHER:  Sybex<br />REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<br />BOOK REVIEW:  Sometimes looking at something bad can help you see what a web page should look like.  You immediately begin to say, I would NEVER do that on a web site.  This begins the creative thought process that, in turn, helps you design a web site everyone will be able to navigate and enjoy.<br />The first thing you should do after purchasing Son of Web Pages That Suck is check out the CD that is included.  It contains over a dozen programs that can help the web designer to create better pages.  A few of the programs that you might want to try are Snag It (captures anything you see on the Windows Desktop), Top Style Pro (checks for cross-browser problems as you work), Color Schemer (helps create color themes) and Screen Ruler (a virtual ruler that you can drag around the screen).  These are trial programs and can be purchased for permanent use.<br />There is a section called Two Minute Offense.  This is an exercise designed to getting you thinking in two minutes of all the problems that show on the web page displayed in that section.

This section will review what went on in the chapter and gives you a chance to be sure you saw everything in that chapter.<br />Remember that wonderful font you found and always wanted to use?

HE SEES YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING<br />AUTHOR:  Mary Higgins Clark and Carol Higgins Clark<br />PUBLISHER:  Simon &amp; Schuster<br />REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<br />BOOK REVIEW:  This is one of the best stories I have read in ages.  It is a story of an \\"almost\\" angel who is sent back to earth to help a young girl and her family.  Witness protection has separated the girl from her beloved father and grandmother.  With a price on their heads for what they have heard, they are unable to come home for Marissa's birthday.  Sterling, the \\"almost\\" angel, is sent to help Marrissa.  Since he was a rather selfish person on earth and the Heavenly Council wants Sterling to provide he is worthy of entering the Heavenly Gates.<br />I had a very hard time putting this book down.  Mary Higgins Clark is the reader and I believe that adds to the telling of the story, as she is co-author.  Knowing the way the story should be told helps in reading it to others.  This is a wonderful tale of one person helping another and the wonders that can occur when we are willing to come to the aid of others.	2002-07-14

Lenker, Jr.<br />PUBLISHER:  New Riders<br />REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<br />This book is not what the title lead me to believe it was about.  I thought it would be a \\"show-and-tell\\" of how to design a better web site.  It might even have been about how to improve on some effects you already were using.<br />Rather it is a colorful picture book of dry discussions on what should and shouldn't be done in a web site.  There are no step-by-step instructions on how to do these suggestions, no \\"show-and-tell\\", no CD with files to help you walk through the ideas, just small print and lots of pictures.<br />Train of Thoughts reminds me of a very dry college text that is all talk and no show.	2002-07-06

DeCandidio,<br />Christie Golden, Robert Greenberger, &amp; Susan Wright<br />PUBLISHER:  Simon &amp; Schuster<br />REVIEWED BY:  Barbara Rhoades<br />BOOK REVIEW:  The Gateways provide unimaginable distance travel in only a few seconds.  Yet rather than just finding a new civilization, unwanted problems occur because people have gone through them.  The builders of the Gateways, The Iconians, are back but do they come in peace or do they want something more.  Read Gateways - What Lay Beyond to find the answer.<br />My suggestion would be to read this ONLY after reading the previous six that sets up everything that happens in this, the seventh book.  So order all of them-<br />One Small Step (Star Trek: Gateways Book One)<br />Chainmail (Star Trek Challenger: Gateways Book Two)<br />Doors into Chaos (Star Trek: The Next Generation: Gateways Book Three)<br />Demons of Air and Darkness (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Gateways Book Four)<br />No Man's Land (Star Trek : Voyager : Gateways Book Five)<br />Cold Wars (Star Trek: New Frontier--Gateways, Book Six)<br />--and settle in for a good reading session.<br />The reader, David Kaye, is very good.  The added sound effects detract from the stories to the point that sometimes you cannot hear what David is saying for sure.  Notwithstanding, this is good ending book for the whole series.  The only drawback I found to the whole series is that they did not interact with the others.	2002-07-05

Isn't that the ultimate goal for any web designer?  Skip Intro\\" is the book that will help a web designer do just that.  The authors uphold the KISS theory (keep it simply stupid) and ask that you know your clients, market, users and goals of the site.<br />Each Chapter begins with a quote from a person (real or animated!) or proverb to get you into the feel of what the chapter will teach.  Hierarch, tool tips, tabbed windows, flexibility and finally less clutter and more usability are all discussed in this 14-chapter book.<br />It comes with a CD, lots of reading and some graphics displays to explain what they are talking about.  The writing is clear and definitions are included in the chapters to make sure you know the technical terms they are discussing.  There are also side notes from the authors to help clarify the discussions.<br />Is Flash what you need to brush up on or pick up an extra pointer or two?

No waiting for the download from the web site taking 2 hours or more.

The various authors discuss the chance of weather conditions, timing, leadership, and political concerns have affected the outcome of Western Civilization.  The authors give sufficient details of the back round and circumstances surrounding these events to better illustrated why people made the decisions they did.  They exam the possible consequences IF events had turned out a different way.<br />Two of the examples that were discussed were the Battle of Solomus and The Battle for Jerusalem.  The authors gave the required background information relating to the subject matter and if the circumstances would have been different, the way modern Western Europe would have had a more Eastern thought process and development.  There would have possibility not been a monolith God-type religion centered on Jewish beliefs.<br />This book would be a must read for anyone who enjoys a good story, is interested in history, and has ever wondered why certain events turned out as they did today.

The other five chapters cover CSS DHMTL, Motion, Rollovers and templates and library objects.<br />A CD-ROM is included to help work through the information with a 4-page Table of Contents and a 7-page index to help look up specific items.

The information is laid out in an easy-to-follow format.<br />This book is not one I would pick as my first choice for a Dreamweaver reference but it certain would be useful if you needed navigation help in your webs.  If the authors expand on the five chapters without the menus and navigation, Dreamweaver 4 Magic would become a magical book to have in your library.	2001-06-09

The main characters were young boys when the story opened.  They were the best of pals &#8211; like brothers.  Each grew up to become aviators in the United States Army Air Corps.  They always helped and watched over each other as the events of their lives led up to Pearl Harbor where they fell in love with the same woman.<br />Mr. Wallace&#8217;s story was historically incorrect in two areas.  Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Fleet, remained on his Flag Ship in the Sea of Japan rather than with the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor.  The other incorrect historical reference was that the United States did NOT declare war on the Third Reich at the same time as Japan but rather this event occurred three days later.<br />I would recommend this book for people who enjoy historical love stories.  Jay O. Sanders was an excellent reader who held my interest and I finished the book in two days.	2001-05-29

This is very strange since the book is about FLASH.  Aren't those the dynamic, eye-catching pages on a web site?  So why would a book written about how to use FLASH be in black and white?<br />Generator/Flash is written in a small font making what little code there is very hard to read.  The saving grace of this book is that it comes with a CD where you can find exercises.  The chapters contain information on building templates and building a database.<br />Generator/Flash is a book that will help those who design for the server-side of web sites.	2001-05-01

After three quarters of the first tape, the story had yet to get to anything to do with spying.

It talked of the politics and even had a customer come in to get fitted for a suit.  It described the receptionist and how she had gotten the scars on her face.

Chapter Three which is approximately 60 pages long goes through Color Management.  There are two chapters on images and one on Tools and automation.  And all of this can be found in Part I.<br />Part II contains information on layers and special effects using type.  Part III takes the reader through Color Correction, working with pictures and repairing them, using the tools and making surrealistic images.<br />Part IV brings the reader to the Web itself.  Finally, in Part V, there is information on the CD that comes with the book, resources and what wasn't covered in the book.  Even though the book is very long, there are graphical examples throughout plus Tips, Notes, and Warnings.<br />This book is not made for overnight reading but is definitely one that anyone using Photoshop should have on hand.  It may not be one that you read from cover to cover, but it will be certain to have the material to answer your questions.	2001-02-09

A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Read it Cover to Cover	The first thing I noticed about this book is that the back cover doubles as a bookmark.  VERY ingenious!

While I don't believe in using pre-designed templates as is, it certainly is a great way to get your creative mind moving in the right direction.  Pick a template, take the pieces you like from it and create your own specialized design.<br />Chapters one and two begin with some very basic information on HTML coding.  It gives the code and then a pictorial example of what the code does.  Chapters three through seven provide information about when and where to use the templates in that chapter and then shows the pictures of what each will look like.  Chapter eight explains DHTML, CCS, Layers, SSI and CGI with detailed coding examples.<br />An eight-page index and a five page content section allows the user to find the exact piece of information for which they are looking.  AND as and added benefit, they are easier to use and locate what you want than looking in the Yellow Pages!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who designs webs and has \\"writer's block\\" now and again.  This covers just about every designer I know so be sure to add this to your \\"must have\\" library.	2001-02-09
