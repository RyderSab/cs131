This is one of the very few books of photographs dedicated solely to images taken with a Holga camera. Unfortunately this collection of images is too disjointed. Content-wise the pictures cover a wide range from landscapes, to urban scenes, to people snapshots. Most are color, a few black and white. And although this collection is by a professional photographer, I have seen more interesting and cohesive image galleries of Holga photographs on the internet. Another downside is the physical production of the book. The book is a very flimsy softcover (with an unusual, weak binding) that doesn't seem like it will last very long. I would recommend this only to Holga collector's who must own *everything* Holga.	2005-10-05

From the book's own website it explains (as you will see if you have also bought this book) that the brushes and color sets included on the CD-R do not work on a PC and you need to do a work-around on a Mac: As stated on the book's site:<br /><br />\\"The Resource CD that comes with the book unfortunately has an error with the brushes. The Jeremy Faves 2.0 category icon file doesn't work. On a Mac, to make these brushes work, follow these steps:<br />1. Drag into the trash the Jeremy Faves 2.0.jpg file you copied over. (NOT the Jeremy Faves 2.0 folder containing the variants, which you can leave as is).<br />2. Drag/copy the icon shown here onto your desktop.<br />3. Drag/copy the icon file, Jeremy Faves 2.0.jpg, from your desktop to the Corel Painter IX > Brushes > Painter Brushes folder.<br />4. Restart Painter (or choose Load Brush Library from the brush selector pop-up menu, highlight Painter Brushes and choose Load).<br />5. Open the brush category pop-up menu and you should find the Jeremy Faves 2..0 at the very top of the list. The first time you use this category you may find some brushes need time to build.<br /><br />I am still evaluating how to resolve this on a PC. From the feedback I've had so far from PC users (see note above) the brushes don't work even if you replace the jpg. I am talking with the publisher about resolving this issue. Any resolution will be posted here.\\"<br /><br />Very disappointing...I'd suggest waiting for another book on Painter IX to come out.<br /><br />May 8, 2005. P.S. After writing this review, it is interesting to note that several new reviews were written to say they had no problems with the CD included and rated the book 5 stars. Also, the very first review for this book was re-edited to add that point they also had no problems with the CD. Yet the book's very own web site states there were in fact problems with the CD. One good note for people who have bought this book is that the book's web site says people who receive a defective CD will be able to request a fixed, revised CD.vised CD.	2005-04-08

If you own the Whitney book, there's no need to pick up this one because you'll be looking at a lot of duplicate images. If you don't own a Basquiat book, you can't really go wrong with either edition and I would lean towards the newer book. But there's no need to own both of them. So why the low rating? It's a shame that the curators didn't take the opportunity to add something new for Basquiat fans. Many years have passed since the 1st Whitney retrospective and we're basically presented with a book that repeats what's already been printed. Unfortunately we'll have to wait for someone else to put out a book of new Basquiat material for us to see.	2005-03-25

Most of the pin-ups are black and white Conte crayon drawings done on a beige colored paper. There are a few color pin-ups shown as well. The beginning of the book contains a concise biography of Ward along with samples of his comic-book art. There are several nice romance covers shown here. The book is printed on quality paper and the pin-ups shown at a nice size. This is an A+ effort. The only thing you could have asked for is more art, but at around 100 pin-ups this is a great tribute to Bill Ward.	2004-04-07

This latest  effort from Mrs. Pickens should have taken a mulligan and swung again. The \\"romance\\" is pot-boiler, fill-in-the-blanks, auto-pilot romance writing at its worst. The author of this attempt at romance completely misses the mark with undeveloped, unremarkable characters and a storyline that leaves you out in the cold. Pickens should head back to the country club or take a few practice strokes out on the driving range before attempting another \\"romance\\" again. This \\"Stroke of Luck\\" cost me $5.00 and left me frigid.... I think I would have found more heat in a golf magazine and more luck at a blackjack table. Definitely not recommended: did I make my opinion clear enough? ( lol ) There are many better romance writers to read, don't waste your time with Pickens' \\"Stroke of Luck\\".	2003-12-04

Poker Wisdom is a fairly accurate title: this book contains poker stories from Brunson's past each with a \\"moral\\" as applied to poker. Some of the titles for the chapters are \\"Pride and Poker\\", \\"Honor in Gambling\\", \\"Gambling with Girls\\". Each essay is about 2-5 pages long. Some of the stories are fun to hear, sort of like listening to a poker campfire tale and others are entirely forgetable.

I've found this book to be very useful to bring on road trips on the east coast and on the west coast. Having the information of where and when a flea market is taking place all in one place is handy and convenient. The flea markets are broken down by state, and then by city. The larger flea markets have a description of what you can expect to find, types of dealers, size, etc. There also a &quot;phone book listing&quot; after the larger flea markets in a state that are just names, phone numbers, addresses, but no description. So far, most of the flea markets I have looked up and gone to are there. The only problem has been in the descriptions for the larger flea markets: they aren't always on the mark in terms of what you can expect to find. Some of the decriptions are outdated and some are too general leading to disappointment when finally arriving at a new flea market. But overall, for the information (names, dates, locations) this is useful.	2003-08-07

This book has some good information in it for all levels of poker players. However, if you have already bought Sklansky's two books on Hold 'Em, then you already have the information that's in this book. However, I prefer having the information as presented in the hold 'em books because the examples are are Texas hold 'em examples whereas for this book the information has been generalized to all poker games in general. Personally, I would buy the two hold 'em books and not buy this book--there's nothing I would have missed out on (and these poker books aren't cheap).	2003-08-07

Crumb or those who want a compilation of &quot;women&quot; drawings this is a nice book. Great productions values: the cover, endpapers, binding, paper stock are all first class. The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there is very little work from recent years. I counted 6 drawings from 2002, 5 drawings from 2001, and only 2 from 2000. (There are no drawings from 2003). Most of the material is from the 1980's. I would have liked a more even sampling of material throughout the years and would have really been interested to see what new and recent work (if any) he's been doing on the subject of women.

Unfortunately, most of the pages are filled with photos of streets, graffiti, and wide views of installations. Because of the small size of the book (6 x 9) it's hard to see much detail of the actual artwork. Some of the pages reproduce the art as a full page, but most are photographs of  the scenerey. The book cover shows off the artwork nicely, but there are only a dozen or so \\"art\\" pages. This definitely shows the locations where McGee's art appears, but it's hard to make out the art. This is not really an 'art book' with full page reproductions of artwork, but more of a chronicle of McGee, photographs of locations, photos of people, photos of installations. You can say that the locations are a part of the art but when you want to see a closeup shot of a bottle with a painted face on it you'll be disappointed. All of the books on McGee suffer in really showing of the painting/illustrations McGee Does because they all take the documentary approach in showing photos of locations with McGee art. But the photos are snap-shot quality and the painted art is secondary.	2003-03-27

Be forewarned, however, that there are only 16 pages of color reproductions in the book. Those pieces that are shown in color are not necesarily the most exciting Oaxacan carvings I've ever seen so in the \\"art book\\" category this book fails to give the reader much to look at. But if you are interesting in learning about how the carving market developed, how the artists and sellers fit into the overall scheme, and how Oaxacan carvings are sold to buyers and collectors, this is an interesting read. It's written in a dry, scholarly tone, and feels like an economics text book. But the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" information is something that isn't addressed too often. So while I like the information, I wished the style of writing were livlier and would have liked many more examples (in color) of Oaxacan art. Recommended for those with a deep interest in Oaxacan wood carving tradition, not recommended for those looking for a catalog of Oaxacan art to look at.	2003-03-25

The words seem strained and for the most part are a little flat, a little basic. The stories seem like they wold have been better condensed as simple comics or picture books. The artwork is the main draw (all black and white illustrations inside) but some drawings seem more polished than others. There seems to be a span of 4 years between some of the dates on the drawings so the quality isn't consistent with some of the illustrations appearing rushed and dashed out. I guess this book will appeal mostly to those who already like the author's previous comics, but for those who aren't friends or fans, this was a disappointment.	2003-02-13

First off, I thought the art and story as presented in the original comics where excellent. 5 Stars. But for this graphic novel collection, the artwork has been re-colored in a disturbing green duotone. The green color is too jarring making it difficult to see the details in the art. Unfortunately you'll need to see it for yourself as art is a visual medium, but sadly, the green color used to print this comic destroys the artwork. I had to send mine back... it's just not pleasant to look at. Go and buy the original comics, you'll enjoy it much more. 0 Stars for the hardcover edition.<br />NOTE: For the paperback edition of this graphic novel, the artist and publisher reverted the colors back to the original colors that were used in the comic book series. They decided not to use the horrid green color that was used in the hardcover edition. Although 0 of 2 people said they found my original review unhelpful, it appears the publisher and artist were also both unhappy with how the hardcover colors turned out. And it appears they heard from other readers as well. Be sure to buy the softcover edition as it reprints the colors as they were in the original comics. A major improvement and highly recommended. 5 stars for the softcover.	2002-11-06

But this book gets a thumbs down and here's why:<br />1) It's way too short at just 106 pages. That just isn't room to even begin to go into Omaha Holdem.<br />2) There's very little information here: Page one is devoted to the &quot;Popularity of the Game.&quot; Page two &quot;The Rules&quot;. Page 3 &quot;The Showdown.&quot; Pages 4-5 &quot;Origin of Omaha.&quot; Pages 6-8 are about community card poker. Pages 9-13 are about betting and the blind structure. Page 14-15 are about learning to read the board in Omaha (you must use 2 cards from yourhand and 3 from the board). Pages 16-18 are about &quot;Should you learn Omaha?&quot;. Pages 19-23 are about comparing Omaha and Texas holdem. And remember, this book is only 106 pages long so there's no much left for actual strategy.<br />3) Pages 91-97 are about tournaments.<br />4) pages 98-101 are about &quot;Future Ideas for Omaha&quot;.<br />I simply found that there was barely enough information to even get started. For some reason this book is shorter than any of Ciaffone's other books even though Pot Limit Omaha<br />&quot;represents the ideal form of poker&quot; to the author. I wish there were more information here but there simply isn't. Buyer beware, this book is short, not in-depth, and will provide only the very basics of beginning Omaha.	2002-10-10

These days you can figure that everyone out there playing Hold Em has read this book or knows the information in it so it's an essential read. After reading this book and playing with the strategies presented, players will probably want to pick up the sequel to this book, Hold Em Poker for Advanced Players. Note: these books are primarily geared toward &quot;ring&quot; play or money tables, not tournament play (although concepts can apply to tournament play). If you eventually feel like you want to try out some hold em tournaments, beware of Sklansky's &quot;Tournament Poker for Advanced Players&quot; book as it tries to cover playing in Texas Hold Em, Omaha, and 7-Card stud tournaments all at once.

Although the title of the book carries the \\"for Advanced Players\\" tag, I feel that this book is better geared towards someone just starting out playing poker tournaments. The strategy and guidelines are very basic. If you play just a few tournaments (small or big), you'll understand the basics of tournament play much better than this book can explain in words. Much of the basic tournament strategy covered here can also be found by looking at online websites. Another problem with this book is that it is a general \\"tournament\\" poker book. It's not specifically geared towards Texas Hold Em, Omaha, or Stud. So the advice given is very general and at times \\"skips\\", jumping from Hold Em advice in one paragraph then Stud to the next. The problem is that I would have preferred more in-depth information devoted to just Hold Em (or stud or Omaha) since the games are very different from one another. So except for the generalities that can apply across the board to the 3 different games, there's no real \\"meat\\". Other than a few pages devoted to the \\"gap\\" concept, I didn't find anything that new or interesting presented by this book. A series of books I did like were the \\"Tournament\\" books by Cloutier and McEvoy. There's one book devoted to tournament limit hold em, one for no-limit and pot-limit, and one for Omaha. The Sklansky book would have been much better if it were devoted solely to playing Texas Hold Em Tournaments (or Omaha or Stud) rather than trying to cover all 3 at once. If you're looking for a basic introduction to tournaments, this is recommended. But for anyone past the beginning stage, this book may not have much to offer. Overall, this was a very disappointing book as Sklansky's \\"Hold Em for Advanced Players\\" book was very good.	2002-07-01

My main interest in buying this book was for information on Omaha high-low and overall I found this to be very disappointing. First, since the book is split between stud and omaha, I had little interest in the stud portion. Second, the information on Omaha was of a very general nature and not nearly as in-depth and specific as the Hold Em for Advanced Players by Sklansky. Why Omaha high-low didn't get its own book is beyond me, is it because the author just doesn't have that much strategy to share?  That was my feeling and I ended up selling my copy through amazon marketplace. I've found more useful information on Omaha strategy at online websites than in this book.	2002-07-01

Some of his nice tiki themed images aren't here, and there's a number of commercial illustrations that I didn't care for. But overall a nice selection. It's his only retrospective book collection so it's your only choice right now. Although a quick seller, the book is being revised and improved for its second printing so don't spend too much cash on a 1st printing is you have to have one now, the 2nd printing will be the better buy when it comes out. Honestly, the cover price on this was $[money] and amazon's price was $[money]. So to pay $[money] plus some people are asking for is crazy!	2002-06-14

There are a few pieces of artwork shown for the various artists covered and a short bio. Nothing in depth in terms of the artwork shown or the information given. This is basically your standard collection of the usual suspects in folk art today. A little bit of Dial, Tolliver, Young, Burnside, Light, etc. And the pieces shown aren't that special. It's great they've got a couple of Mose Tolliver's, but they aren't that special in the overall spectrum of Mose's work.  Since nothing is in-depth, I'm not really sure what the point of this book is as it adds nothing new to the field. It's great Ronald and June Shelp own all these pieces, but so what? Good for them, but the book adds nothing for the reader. A much better survey is Souls Grown Deep. Much more expensive, but well worth it.	2002-06-06

There are some wonderful paintings in this group and all the images are presented full page. There are around 3-4 pages of introductory text and analysis of each painting by various folk collectors, critics and artists. So far this is the only book soley devoted to West's artwork and therefore the best. My main gripe is that in addition to the 13 Revelation paintings reproduced, there are only a few other paintings shown. I would have liked to have been able to see more of Myrtice West's artwork in addition to the 13 Revelation paintings. Its a short look at a narrow focus of her artwork and left me wanting to see more. For a [price] cover price, it's rather pricey for the number of color reproductions you get. 3 stars for the great artwork shown, but I was expecting to see more.	2002-05-28

The thorough research done on Edgar Tolson is fascinating and through his art and career the world of 20th century folk art is examined. From key folk art collectors to various museums and institutions, the 20th century folk art movement was created and sold to the buying public. By the time the &quot;important&quot; artists were established all of the &quot;important&quot; early work was already in the hands of a few collectors and the museums. It's no accident that Tolson's work ended up in a prestigious Whitney Biennial and his artwork sky-rocketed in price. The same with Howard Finster. By the time his work was presented as being important to the general public, a narrow group of collectors and critics had already hoarded the first few thousand of his numbered pieces which the critics then deemed as the most important of his career. And the story continues to this day with collectors / critics buying early key works, then recommending them to the general folk art buyers. This book is perhaps the best analysis of why and how a folk artist becomes &quot;important&quot; in the 20th century. It may or may not sour your view on 20th century folk art but is a great read either way. As with all art or decorative objects, if you just buy what you like and ignore the critics, you'll be happy. Who's to say 10, 20 or 50 years from now if anyone will even care about &quot;20th century folk art.&quot;	2002-05-28

This self-proclaimed 20th century encyclopedia of American Folk Art came out in 1991... how could it be a comprehensive look at the century's folk art in America when 9 years didn't even happen when they wrote this? There are artists left out and what is written is often slanted with regards to &quot;collectability&quot; since the authors' have invested in a large folk art collection. The emphasis is often that the early work is really the only inspired work. Once an artist is &quot;discovered&quot; by the public the art is no longer as good so you should only have the early pieces, like the ones in the encyclopedia. This bias also occurs in the author's book on Collecting American Folk Art. But really, the big flaw in this book is that it was written 9 years before the end of the century and has left out many worthwhile artists. A very disappointing book.	2002-04-24

Many of the great African American folk artists of the 20th century are covered and all have a short write up and some pictures. The only problem is that some artists get short change with a one paragraph write up (really short) and 2 or 3 small images on a single page. Clementine Hunter for example, gets this treatment. And Mose Tolliver gets much more space than Bill Traylor, possibly because most of the artwork shown is from the author's own folk art collection, but apparently the author doesn't have many Bill Traylor artworks compared to Mose T's. But it's such a large book that it will still be required for any folk art library. Beware, the second volume is just as big but seems like an entire book of filler. There are some interesting artists presented, but overall the quality isn't as high as the first volume. Perhaps because the artists in the 1st volume are already &quot;established&quot;' it's easier to see their place in folk art history whereas the artists in volume 2 are still relatively new. Both books have high production values in paper and binding. My recommendation is definitely buy volume 1, but be careful of volume 2.	2002-04-24

This and the Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings are my 2 favorite Darger books. But beware book collectors, because the book has so many pages (500 plus), the pages start to come loose from the binding. For some reason, the binding just can't hold the pages securely.

An artist is profiled with a few examples of their work, a write up, and photo portrait. Everything is reproduced in color, glossy paper, a large sturdy book that's a nice general survey.<br />My main interest in Mexican folk art is the woodcarving from Oaxaca. The cover of the book is of a Oaxacan carving which drew my attention the book. However, for those interested in Oaxacan folk art, this book only profiles a few artists of the genre (the Jimenez family being one of them).Out of the 500+ pages there are maybe 20-30 pages on the painted woodcarvings and for that reason I only gave the book 2 stars. For a broad, general survey of Mexian folk art this is a good book. Those looking for in-depth examples of Oaxacan art won't find much in here.	2002-04-03

They're reproduced almost as footnotes to the text but my main reason in buying an art book is for the visuals. And with Bosch, there are so many details but they were just too small to see here. The art should have been given a full page without text surrounding an image. This was a big let down, I was looking forward to buying this book, but now I'll pass on it. With the small reproductions it just isn't worth the price. The 1 star is for Bosch's art which is still great despite the poor book design.	2002-04-02

This book is definitely geared towards someone who has little or no knowledge of hold-em poker at all. If you have played, know the rules, and the very basics of play, then this book probably won't add much. I've found the 1st Sklansky book on hold-em poker to be the best starter book. It's compact, but the ideas presented are immediately applicable and usefull. It provides basics of strategy on plays you can make, and also makes you aware of plays your opponent might be making on you. The Jones book is more basic, guiding someone through the first steps of the rules of hold em and playing at a table. Good for an absolute beginner, but for someone who has played even a little, probably not enough new info.	2001-12-18

The information is not very detailed and felt more like reading a succession of magazine articles versus a thought out book of strategy. The organization of the book was too piecemeal for my taste.

While there are some fine examples of street signs that can be appreciated as \\"folk art\\", many of the examples in this book are just interestingly lettered signs. And after a while, I wanted something more than just a photographic showcase of interesting letters and typography. Unlike some of the hand-painted garden signs from Howard Finster's Paradise Gardens, or the \\"spirit\\" writing of J.B. Murray, or the frenzied writings of Prophet Royal Robertson which express the unique world view of the artist, many of the hand-written signs in this book are just interestingly lettered or arranged. Some are fun to look at, but as a whole this group of signs falls far below a great showing of \\"folk art.\\"<br />In my opinion, this book is a case of someone wanting to make something into folk art...the author's are just reaching a little too far in most of the illustrations. It's great that someone has travelled extensively and photographed these signs that most of us will never see, but to make the case they are folk art is stretching it and a little misleading. Perhaps I was expecting more, but other than being visually pleasing, the signs shown were otherwise unengaging.

I thought the excesses of the 1980's had long since passed but then comes along this massive (and expensive) volume on Jean-Michel Basquiat, one of the Kings of the 80's art scene two decades ago. Sadly, like much art from that period, Basquiat's faux-primitve paintings come across more like deliberate attempts at critical and commercial success than intuitive genius from a true visionary painter. The art world and its consumers were desperate and happy in the 80's to champion \\"street art\\" and graffiti with the growing popularity of folk art in the 1970's. The professional art world latched on to it's own, professional artists working in a vernacular style (Haring, Scharf, Basquiat) in order to appear open to less progromatic art. With folk art, critics and museums of modern art were caught looking backward and left behind. Urban street art, positioned as being more sophisticated and hip, was marketed to an eager consumer market. Is this truly great art? Is Basquiat worthy of a ...book signed by a gallery owner (seller)? Is this the best modern art has to offer? Looking at page after page in this retrospective book becomes a tedious task. The words don't add up to the great poetry of Dickens or Whitman. The artwork can be found in its purer form on the streets of any urban city. Try taking a walk through New York city and leave this book behind. ...	2000-03-25

His bold lines and expressive figures are pop art in the purest sense. This volume which includes all the early Thor appearances are printed nicely in a hardcover edition. My one complaint is  that somehow, the new, improved computer coloring seems somehow a little  too slick, too polished. There's something about the bold, flat colors of  vintage comics that added to their appeal. But it's nice to have these  comics collected in a bookshelf edition and hopefully Marvel will continue  to bring back the rest of the volumes.	2000-03-25

Books	3	5	5	N	N	We Are the World	Like many publications spearheaded by Art Spiegelman and Raw Graphics, Narrative Corpse has great presentation. The large format and &quot;tabbed&quot; pages add a nice elegance to this &quot;jam&quot; comic. It's a real treat to see so many artists contributing a few panels to a  single storyline. Unfortunately the story itself doesn't hold up but I  guess that's to be expected in a project like this.	2000-03-25

Here is a survey of the past year's magazine designes submitted to the Society of Publication Designers annual competition. There are many wonderful examples  of editorial design presented here and for those with a print fetish, it's  exciting stuff. However, like any competition, the book does not  necessarily contain the &quot;best&quot; work out there simply because not  everything is submitted and judges' tastes are biased. Still, what's there  is enjoyable.	2000-03-25
