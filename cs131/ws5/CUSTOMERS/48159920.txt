This book is a big lie!<br />Although i knew nothing about this \\"true account\\" when i picked it up, as i got deeper into the book I sensed something was missing.  Jay's character didn't add up.  He struck me as too sane and objective to be crazy, too moral and connected with himself to be so immoral, too mature in his thoughts and writing to be so immature, and FAR TOO HONEST AND EXPRESSIVE WITH HIMSELF to be so dishonest with everyone around him.  The fact that he killed himself just didn't add up to me.  I'm a psychotherapist who works with suicidal people (adults now but teens in the past) and i just didn't buy it.  At first i wondered if Sparks simply changed too much of Jay's identifying information (which even Freud warns against in recounting case studies) to make the story hold, but later i found myself wondering if she had actually re-written the journal herself to fit HER needs (perhaps to sell books, get famous, whatever - or perhaps some more sinister psychological desire to disguise a worthy person's true story).<br />Although i still don't know what actually happened in \\"Jay's\\" case, ten minutes of internet research showed me claims that Jay (supposedly really Alden Barrett) was never even into the occult at all!  Also, there were claims he was schizophrenic (of which this supposed \\"journal\\" gives no indication), and that \\"Dr.\\" Beatrice Sparks (who should lose her license if this proves true) MADE UP whole sections of the book (more than 50%), weaving in \\"accounts\\" of other teenagers she supposedly knew.<br />One thing for which i am grateful about this book is that Sparks is only a mediocre writer.  Had she produced a more believable account of \\"Jay's Journal\\", i probably never would have become suspicious and taken my suspicions beyond the state of contemplation.<br />I think what is called for here is the publication of \\"Jay's\\" actual journal so the reader sort the rest out for him or herself.	2002-08-18

 what's up with that?  talk about bad boundaries.  of course, the doctor could easily defend her bad boundaries by just hiding behind being a wonderful, loving, caring, compassionate therapist - BUT I DON'T BUY IT ENTIRELY.  i think dr. wilbur was trying to prove in some unconscious way to sybil (or to herself) that she, the doctor, was the real opposite of sybil's mom.  perhaps the doctor was trying to defend against some of her own feelings of being LIKE sybil's mom.  and by the way, sybil's exceedingly manipulative behavior at times might drive even the best of us to feel pissed off at her and want to get even at some level.  but not dr. wilbur - oh no! - did you notice that the one feeling she never has toward sybil is ANGER - let alone HATRED?!  i think the doctor couldn't handle those NASTY feelings within herself and simply defended herself against them by ACTING THEM OUT and then calling them therapeutically necessary.<br />  other examples of this:  getting sybil hooked on sodium pentathol to \\"help\\" her treatment.  and what about that little line of getting sybil \\"shock therapy.\\"  yeah, right!<br />and by the way, i read on the internet after finishing the book about the outcome of sybil's life:  she followed dr. wilbur down to lexington kentucky where the two lived nearby...happily ever after...as the best of friends.  what's up with that?

I loved the portrait of the rough, conservative, yet caring island people and for the most part I found the characters and their interactions believable.<br />Where I think the book failed, however, was in its treatment of the main theme - everyone's favoritism of the talented twin over the narrator.  I not only think the author went overboard (pardon the boating pun) with the cruelty, but then trivialized it at the end by attempting to wrap it up sweetly and tie it in a neat bow.  It lacked emotional resolution, and I felt cheated.<br />The girl was practically driven crazy by her family's neglect and not once in the book does anyone but herself ever acknowledge it.  And then the author has the audacity (or lack of emotional insight) to \\"make it all alright\\" at the end by having the mother say, in so many words, \\"but we really loved you all along - we just knew you could take care of yourself, and didn't need our special attention.\\"  Well, this just doesn't cut it for me, but for some reason it does for the narrator.  SHE ACCEPTS IT at face value and then goes on to live happily ever after.  Yeah right!  What happened to all those years of pent up rage?  Don't tell me it disappeared - she just buried it!  That family messed her up, and her acceptance of her mother's lame explanation is just a sign of how shut-down and compromised a life the narrator will go on to live.  For this reason, I would never want to read a sequel to this book.	2001-12-13

The tale it tells of a boy, his father, and a pig says just about everything worth saying.  It struck me that this book had been percolating in the author's mind for around five decades, and clearly burst out when ripe.<br />This rather odd title got me curious, and I was hooked by page one!  So many marvelous and subtle juxtapositions.  The writing is beautiful, interweaving great modern prose with dialogue in odd but readable post-World War One Vermont farmer and Shaker dialects.  And the boy is a juxtaposition himself, on the cusp of adolescent and on the cusp of leaving behind obsolete Shaker ways.  And his family, conservative and Shaker and backwoods and prudish yet human and emotionally connected and wise and utterly blunt about the facts of life, all at the same time!<br /><br />I love a book in which an author can conjure a time and a place and people long since past, and translate their ways into a language and story we in our fast modern world can easily relate to.

Marvelously written, characters with flesh-and-blood aliveness, fantastic insights into people and culture and situations, very simply and clearly yet subtly written (with great sharp transitions - she doesn't waste your time!), and so emotionally connected - this book brought tears to my eyes several times...which is why I'm recommending it so highly.  Most books can't pull that off.<br />And although at times it is an uplifting book, mostly it's really a sad book, a book about pain and heartache and people who can't fit it, who fall between the cracks, who are rejected by American society at large, and at times their own cultures and families.  It so beautifully depicts people living compromised lives, yet living nonetheless and making the best of it.  It offers a great entrance into a time and place that I don't often get much contact with.  Thank you, Nicholasa (and I loved your book Nilda also)!	2001-12-09

Although I liked the book, I can't say I loved it.  In fact, at several points I felt like saying, \\"who cares?!?\\"<br />I think the whole thing about O'Dell is that there is something empty about his writing, something dead and dry.  When his characters die you don't really feel bothered by it, because it's almost like they were emotionally dead anyway - like he didn't bring them to life.  I think that's why The Island of the Blue Dolphins worked better than this one.  In the Blue Dolphins, the main character really was in an odd way dead - completely separated from her entire family, tribe...and from humanity.  And somehow O'Dell made her seem so much more real - you could relate to her.  In this book, however (just like in Zia), he tries to create a main character who is connected with humanity, with a community, and with a family...but somehow you're just left feeling that those connections are missing.<br />I keep hoping the next book I pick up by him will move me the way Island of the Blue Dolphins did, and I keep getting let down.	2001-12-09

I was expecting Hershey's, but no!  It was Godiva.<br />Good points:  An excellent and clever plot with lots of fast little unexpected twists and turns, characters that were surprisingly more dimensional than one would expect, many sharp little psychological insights, lots and lots and lots of good strong detail about the FBI, the CIA, and most of all, about big-league shooting.  (I used to be a shooter way back when, and I had no idea there was so much intricacy to it.  I just bought the gun, loaded it, aimed it as best I could, and shot it...and didn't think too much.)  Also, the \\"good guy\\" characters are extremely sympathetic, and you can't wait for the \\"bad guys\\" to get what's coming to them.  Lastly, the book is LONG, so it doesn't just start and stop and leave you wanting more.<br />Weaknesses:  at times a little predictable, and at times certain characters somewhat overdone (like Dr. Dobbler - he was just a one-trick pony, which is unrealistic for a &quot;brilliant&quot; psychiatrist, and he could have had more character growth).  And lastly, though perhaps this isn't fair, I find myself wondering what motivates someone like Stephen Hunter to write a book like this...a book which, despite its interesting and quick points and rich detail, has very little philosophically or emotionally growth-oriented about it.  I guess it's the same thing that motivates someone out there to spend their life developing the ultimate formula for Godiva chocolate.  But then again, thank god for Godiva!	2001-11-11
US	48159920	R3FUDC77F10XX7	059035342X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	Books	2	26	37	N	N	enchanting at times, but definitely not a classic	I think the real appeal of this book - why millions of all ages have been drawn to it - is its strong basic theme.  It's the story of an abused and under-appreciated person being recognized for his true inner greatness.  It's easy to relate to because this greatness lives within each of us, and this story gives us hope that maybe...someday...our own greatness will be recognized.<br />My problem with this book is that this great theme - this classic theme - is rendered into a weak story.  The Hobbit works off the same theme, but J.R.R Tolkien weaves his story with far more finesse.  The Hobbit's character development is slow and subtle, with depth and insight.  Harry Potter, on the other hand, goes from being a miserable, abused, depressed kid to being a worshipped bigshot in a matter of two pages, which amounts to the entire character development in the story.  To make matters worse, the entire shift happens through no work or perseverance of his own.  Bilbo Baggins has to work and has to face real emotional challenges...and you grow to respect him for it.  Harry Potter:  he's essentially the same character at page 50 and page 310.<br />And the Hobbit...what tension in the story!  It followed an emotional arc, slowly unfolding, with the unique and many-sided characters become increasingly lovable and admirable.  Harry Potter lacked this tension, being dull and unsuspenseful by comparison.  I found myself not really caring what happened in the end, and not really being emotionally drawn to any of the characters.  I'll probably forget their names in a few days...  I remember the Hobbit's characters' names years later.<br /> And Harry Potter:  it read like a trivia book...tons and tons of irrelevant names and details and characters and side stories.  It just felt like fluff...the kind kids like to read and amass...but doesn't make for an enduring book.<br />And last extremely annoying point:  why is it that a bunch of completely untrained 11 year olds are able to use better magic and logic and intelligence than the greatest wizards and witches in the world?  It makes for a cute story, but not a cohesive one.<br />So all in all, I predict that this book - and series, from what I can guess - will not become a classic, not even remotely in the same boat as the Hobbit or James and the Giant Peach or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...<br /> If you really want to read a good book, don't buy the hype and read this one...there are others that are better.e better magic and logic and intelligence than the greatest wizards and witches in the world?

But, this book just isn't her greatest, and I found the same problem with it that I found with her last few books...that they're really just a re-tread of her old themes, and her ideas just aren't expanding that much further than those presented in her early classics (For Your Own Good, Drama of the Gifted Child, Thou Shalt Not Be Aware).  Granted, this book has its little gems, little case studies here and there in which she expresses her point of view from a slightly new angle, little lines in which she hits the nail right on the head, but if you read her classics and you avoid this book you won't be missing much.<br />That said, if this is the first (or only) Alice Miller book you come across, you really won't be let down.  And perhaps that's her point.  In each of her books she presents a concise version of her whole point of view, as if to make sure you don't miss it.  And since her point of view is truly classic, so is each of her books regardless of its repetitious nature...this one included.	2001-10-18

Mr. Chips was a delightful and subtle balance of a lovable, caring teacher and a mildly pathetic person...so real...so true to life.  It's the story of an unfulfilled man who falls into his place in the world and grows to accept it as best he can, and becomes loved by others in the process.<br />I found myself increasingly awed by the writer's style as the book proceeded.  There was an extreme comfort in his flow, like he knew exactly what he wanted to say and how to say it.  He was brief yet descriptive, sometimes so perfectly and marvelously descriptive that it really brought me hook, line and sinker into the world of his story - rare in a book, and especially in one so gentle and tender.  It was no surprise for me to find he wrote the book in four days - this book was no hard labor of creation...this book flowed from his essence.  I don't think a book can get much better than this.  This is what writing is all about.  I wish libraries were full of books of this quality.	2001-10-18

It isn't a grandiose book of romance and drugs and wonder, with the teenager becoming a hero or tragic hero.  It's just a simple story of a poor New York born Puerto Rican girl hitting her adolescence during WWII, a story of love, pain, fear, discrimination, poverty, abuse, narrow-minded immigrants, relationship problems, puberty, desire for upward mobility - but none of it told in the sensational or overly dramatic way of so many young adult books.  It's simple, to the point, discreet.  It reminds me of that statement some famous movie director said about another director:  \\"He showed us more with a closed door than most directors do with an open zipper.\\"  It was a book I could enjoy.  It didn't have a strong plot, but it had powerful flesh-and-blood character with hearts and desires.  I would say that the main character struck me as depressed, and actually, you might say most or all of the people in the book - or perhaps the culture at the time - walked around in a cloud of low-level depression.<br /><br />Although I gave the book five stars, it wasn't the kind of book that sets stars blazing in the sky.  It was just a no-nonsense and no-frills portrayal of a time, a place, and a culture...  I would whole-heartedly recommend it.	2001-09-12
US	48159920	RYQHXQMUDQSU1	0679886370	411811908	Stargirl	Books	2	7	15	N	N	a dangerous book, as Stargirl's character didn't add up	My problem with Stargirl was that her character didn't add up on an emotional level.  Spinelli made her into a being of supposedly higher consciousness - an attempt for which I commend him - yet as an author he had no idea what the character of someone of higher consciousness would actually be like.  What he didn't understand about her character he simply disguised as mysterious, mystical and elusive.  Yet if she were really as marvelous and wonderful and insightful and deep as she was supposed to be, she would never have been so elusive.  I think she would have been more sincere and upfront, honest about what she was really feeling, not always throwing questions back at the narrator like some sort of deceptive psychotherapist.<br />We all have desires to break from the mold, to be unique, to stand up to the heartless crowd (ultimately our parents), to be the SELVES we really are deep down under it all.  That's why the beginning of the book was so beautiful...and terrifying...because Stargirl clearly did it.  She was her own person...unique and gutsy and bizarre...she had come out the other side of fakeness...she had some mysterious other-worldly quality.  Yet when Spinelli dug deeper into her and tried to make her into a full and real character, one who had feelings and who interacted, he failed to break through her mystery.  The more he described her, the clearer it became that he had no idea what made her tick, that he was out of his league as a writer.  So he faked it, and made her a disciple of silly pursuits like self-denying meditation...note this...SELF-DENYing.  Since Spinelli couldn't describe her SELF he just did the opposite...took the easy way out and made her HERSELF deny herself.<br />As such, as the book went on it became more and more wooden, black and white:  Stargirl polarized against the WHOLE school, and having no comprehension of why, nor any feelings of regret - not even a three year old would believe that.  Maybe that's the problem, that a three year old wouldn't believe this book, because a three year old is too emotionally honest to believe the kind of deception Spinelli weaves.  And then the issue of Stargirl in a \\"beautiful\\" romance - completely fake, no flesh and blood emotions behind it, simply inserted to catch and titillate an adolescent audience...but no emotionally consistent reason for it being in the book, or in line with her unique character.<br />Stargirl is the character we would all like to be, and Spinelli realizes this, as he apparently wants to be it himself, but he as an author lacks the emotional insight to lead us further down the path toward self-understanding.  What we're left with in Stargirl is a frustrating book that actually takes us in the opposite direction from real self-understanding, and instead toward self-denial...which is exactly what the real Stargirl - unlike the one Spinelli wrote about - would NEVER do.  I sense Spinelli worships Milton Erickson, the famous and not coincidentally Arizona hypnotherapist who \\"cured\\" people by making them more dissociated, and in one famous case study \\"cured\\" a female patient by instructing her to give away - get this - African violets, and she became the famous lady of dissociated goodwill.<br />An author who shines real light on the path toward making a Stargirl is Alice Miller, and deceptive, mysterious, feelingless and self-denying she is NOT!<br />All in all, Spinelli does to the real Stargirl what so many modern Christians do to Jesus, tries to make them into something they're not, and yet set them up as an ideal at the same time, because they know that deep down we all want what the real Jesus and the real Stargirl had..

Incidentally, such teen problems as these are not only limited to teens, which is what makes this book so much more universal than just for a teen audience (I'm 29).  I guess they're universal to the crying teenager within us all.<br />The parts of this book I found unnecessary, gratuitous and even harmful were the sex/romance parts.  I'm not a prude by any means, and I've been through my share of sex and drugs and pain, but I think it's very dangerous to present teen sex - or sex at any age - in such an idealized light, as if sex and romance will solve anything.  It won't, and in fact just obscures the real problems - it's like a drug unto itself.  I think the author added all the sex and romance to capture readers, and perhaps also did it for the chance to indulge in writing a little legitimized porn of his own.  But to present that relationship between Steve and Dub as idealized - even if it did come crashing down - is inappropriate.  I think teens, and adults too, should wait to have sex (or even deeper romance) until they're really ready to handle the emotional consequences, and to let the real depth, consistency and loyalty of the emotional love of their relationship be a prerequisite for the sex.  Just so you know, I know almost no one who qualifies as appropriate to be having sex, and also so you don't think I'm a freak in my viewpoint, you might try reading Gandhi's autobiography.<br />When asked the question by one of his readers about whether he thinks it's possible for a man and a woman (though I feel it's no different for gay relationships) to have an emotionally healthy sexual relationship, Gandhi replies:  \\"yes, I think it's possible...but I just don't think I'm capable of it.\\"  So when Rob Thomas sets up a book to make teen romance and teen sex so tempting and charming and ideal, I can't help but be annoyed, disgusted, and unhappy.  I think he does a real disservice to genuine human growth.ography.<br />When asked the question by one of his readers about whether he thinks it's possible for a man and a woman (though I feel it's no different for gay relationships) to have an emotionally healthy sexual relationship, Gandhi replies:  \\"yes, I think it's possible...but I just don't think I'm capable of it.\\"  So when Rob Thomas sets up a book to make teen romance and teen sex so tempting and charming and ideal, I can't help but be annoyed, disgusted, and unhappy.

I think she, like many writers and would-be famous people, use the most awful bits of their own personal life to launch themselves into the public eye, to get even more famous - but wouldn't that just fan the flames of an erotomanic?  perhaps at some deep and unspoken-of level, despite her true horror of being stalked, she gets some primal gratification from the attention of her stalker, and somehow her stalker picks up on it...like the two of them feed each other...and actually are in a relationship.<br />finally:  never does Doreen Orion mention some vital relationships of her own - that with any therapists of her own, or, and I think most importantly, with her parents.  I can only wonder what knowledge of the dynamics between Orion and these important others would add to my understanding of her apparently still-evolving relationship with her stalker.etween Orion and these important others would add to my understanding of her apparently still-evolving relationship with her stalker.	2001-09-07

It's the timeless story of a wise and worldly teacher sharing his wisdom with a young and innocent and admiring student, telling him to look within, to avoid love for now and seek solitude and personal reflection instead, to first study life in its tiniest and least significant forms in order to discover true beauty, etc.<br />My shock with this book came AFTER reading it, when I discovered that Rilke HIMSELF was only 27 or 28 years old (!) when he started writing to the young poet.  For me, his age did not jive with his tone, which was that of a 85 year old world-weary sage.  It could be he really was wise beyond his years, but I can't help but have the suspicion that some arrogance on his part might be at play.<br />And then, all his talk about the young poet not seeking love, not attempting love poems, not being able to understand love for some time yet - all wonderful and perhaps true advice...but Rilke himself had already married by 25 or 26, and was a father a year later.  is he perhaps giving out the advice that he himself cannot take?  Or seeing all his own unfulfilled (and perhaps denied) hopes for himself in the young and naive poet?<br />All this said, I feel Rilke was a man far ahead of his time, and perhaps one who knew too much about himself and human nature to ever really find true happiness in the time in which he was living.  It's just a sixth sense I get about him, and it may be off the mark, so I write this with some hesitancy - perhaps I'm wrong!<br />In the meantime, I must learn more about the life of Rilke, otherwise this book shall lack a context for me...	2001-09-02

As a therapist myself, I found it appealing and worth the read, especially with the people who were in therapy in the forties and fifties, because I don't hear enough of that perspective.  I also liked the range of people and therapy types the book covered...though granted, it only covered a certain portion of those in therapy (i.e. entirely lacking any racially minority voices, said nothing about purely supportive therapy, didn't touch all the patients whose Medicaid pays for their therapy...).<br />The book's main drawback, however, was that its authors tried to make it into something it really wasn't...  They tried to make it into a textbook or reference book of sorts, something more than just a collection of vignettes.  They (ironically, like so many therapists) had to get in their own two cents constantly, and did it by fleshing everything out with theory, explanations, long-winded chapter and vignette introductions, summaries, recaps, expansions on themes, tepid historical insights...PURE DULLNESS, but moreso, unnecessary.  Once I realized where the real power of the book lay, I just skipped over everything the authors had to say (or almost everything...at times they said an interesting thing or two about a famous therapist) and read the words of the people themselves, and worth it they were!<br />One last criticism:  the authors feigned objectivity in describing different schools of therapy, but time and time again their stilted points of view seeped through.  One example I can think of offhand was their explanation for why psychoanalysts are slow \\"to endorse\\" psychotropic medications:  they said it was \\"because some of their patients have progressed without them and [because of their sometimes intolerable] side effects.\\"  While these may both be perfectly true reasons, they fail to mention the main reason I MYSELF don't endorse them - because, as Alice Miller says (and interestingly, her book Drama of the Gifted Child is mentioned glowingly several times in various vignettes), medications reduce symptoms, and symptoms provide the clue that allows people to trace emotionally their own traumas back into their childhoods...and thus heal.  Medication lops off the symptom, gives temporary relief, but prevents deeper healing!- because, as Alice Miller says (and interestingly, her book Drama of the Gifted Child is mentioned glowingly several times in various vignettes), medications reduce symptoms, and symptoms provide the clue that allows people to trace emotionally their own traumas back into their childhoods...and thus heal.

At first she is presented as a sort of hero and receives the girls' worship, but as the book progresses it becomes clear how unpleasant of a person she really is, despite the positive effects she has on some of the girls.  Also positive in this book is that its plot definitely moves in a solid forward direction and it has a good smattering of flesh-and-blood characters and enough low-level perversity (mild examples of adults seducing teenage girls, and description about girls' developing chests, etc.) to keep the reader more-or-less expectant, or perhaps terrified, of what might just happen next...<br />The weak points:<br />1) much of the writing itself was quite dull, even repetitive, and so often the grammar - in the PROSE! - was horrendous, with the worst offenders being run-on sentences that cause you to knock your head against the wall.<br />2) much of the information provided about the characters was repeated over and over again, almost like the author was doing it purposefully and for some sort of quaint humorous effect, which at first it was, but soon became simply annoying and insulting to the reader.  I began to wonder if what the book really lacked was a strong editor.<br />3) Tons of extraneous detail about subjects that added nothing to the plot's core, subjects such as religion, politics, and who-knows-what-else.

This book was chilling, and I give it a full two thumbs up for being so clear, thought out, well-researched and well-presented.  It gave a play-by-play account of how a cult is created, and how people in need of healing are sucked into it...and trade their lives away for membership in it.  It is also a beautiful example of how compelling such cult life is, and shows some of the clear benefits - despite the horrors - of being in such a world:  the community, protection, camaraderie, agreement with a firm point of view.  These are things we all want and strive for in our own ways - but god, how much these people had to sacrifice to achieve it.  They sacrificed themselves and their self-respect...and also built their world on a house of cards.<br />Mild criticism:  I think author could have gone deeper with the book had she further explored the parallel relationship between the cult dynamics and the dynamics of its members' abusive families of origin (as does Alice Miller in For Your Own Good).  I think all therapy - and all adult relationships - entails the risk of such a non-healing re-creation, essentially just acting out, but what's most frightening is when therapists, like those in this book, not only participate in it...but NURTURE IT for their own benefits.<br />Other criticism:  the book was too long-winded.  I could have happily read a condensed version of this book and gotten just as much out of it.  400+ pages was just too much, yet due to the book's ever-changing nature, it was a tough one to skim.	2001-09-01

Much of the book is a pathetic story of this sick alcoholic father doing just about everything humanly possible in life BUT give her what she needs.  The odd thing about this book, though really not odd considering how common it is, is that this girl goes through her life so utterly proud of her failure of a father, proud of all his accomplishments, proud of the famous people he hobnobs with, proud of how much time he gives them, proud of how fancy and star-studded his parties are, proud of how much he loves his audiences and spares them no attention, proud of how much money he has, and vicariously proud of herself for just being the daughter of one so awesome.<br />It's really a sad book, its saddest aspect being that the daughter, while writing, doesn't even realize that though she felt her father \\"came around\\" in the end and really learned to love her and treat her well, it never really happened!  Sammy David, Jr. DIDN'T come around in the end and learn to love his daughter, his daughter simply matured and learned to relate to him more on his level, thus meeting more of his needs and making a relationship with her that much more palatable to HIM.<br />The reason I found this book worthwhile enough to plow through was that it gave a strong inside view into the life of an extremely wounded and self-centered man and showed now just how much his neglect affected his child, but also how distorted HER thinking could be as a result of this neglect, allowing her to mistake his few crumbs of love far too late in life for the nutritious meal she once deserved.<br />This book is really a daughter's tribute to her famous father.

So many of the anecdotes were utterly parallel to those in the Godfather, as were so many relationships, and even personalities.  We had the Michael Corleone character, the Vito Corleone, the Tattaglias, the Kay Adams...and so many more.  This was a disappointment - I somehow expected him to write a more distinct and new book.  This detracted from its potential fulfillment.<br />Book's basic strengths:  a powerful plot, quick action, strong storytelling, mostly convincing characters, excellent use of detail, and at times heavy suspense... Vintage Puzo.<br />And weaknesses:<br />1)  Puzo does not give insight into the character of Viola, rather, simply sets him up as a sort of superhuman demigod, flawless, powerful, brilliant.  He gives no real, solid reason to explain why someone so intelligent and cunning would have the deep inner need to crave so much power, and to risk so much to get it.  Any reasonably intelligent, insightful, and non-damaged person would have let go of the reins of such dangerous power, gotten rid of the banks, and walked away with a clear billion or so dollars.  Yet Puzo touts Viola's near fatal flaw as a strength!  Psychologically speaking, I think what underlies Puzo writing a book that hinges on this basic flaw is that Puzo is in denial of this very flaw in himself.  I think believe he wishes he had been powerful enough as a child to stand up to his omnipotent and abusive parents, but not being conscious of that in adulthood, acts it out through his utterly grandiose characters who thumb their noses as death and horde power at all costs - these Dons, Violas, Michael Corleones.<br />2)  Unlike in the godfather, where Michael Corleone WON the Mafia battle but LOST the personal one, Viola WON and Mafia battle AND ALSO WON the personal one!  This double-win defeated some of Omerta's potential strength (strength that the Godfather retained), namely, letting the reader know that winning the power struggle is really no inner win at all...  This leads me to infer that Mario Puzo himself has not made headway in resolving his own childhood issues in the past thirty years...and in fact has probably taken a few steps backward...<br />3)  Some surprisingly wooden dialogue, especially early on in the book - I was surprised that Puzo would/could make dialogue so fake...perhaps he's losing his touch.strength that the Godfather retained), namely, letting the reader know that winning the power struggle is really no inner win at all...

He amazingly remembered a lot of it, to his credit, and it was horrific!  As far as I was concerned, however, the rest of the book was junk.<br /><br />Book's weak points:<br /><br />1) \\"the third worst case of child abuse in the state of California\\" - pure grandiosity!  Yes, that boy went through living hell, but c'mon, who's rating?<br /><br />2) His idea that he's so completely turned his life around, worked through his abuse, and is now living a purely positive life - gimme a break!?!  I didn't feel he really worked through his abuse all that much.  What I did feel was that he walled off all his feelings around the abuse and simply moved on with his life, put his abuse past him.  Only in that way, I believe, could he have written such an emotionally dead story of his own abuse.  This book lacked feeling!  It was more like he was just retelling what happened on a surface level - but not on an emotional level within.<br /><br />3) And the tell-all:  supposedly the author has really worked through his abuse, but I don't feel he's broken the abuse cycle at all, with the dead giveaway for me being what he did with his adult life:  joined the Air Force, and \\"played a major role\\" in Desert Storm, joining in the slaughter and destruction of Iraq, a great way for an out-of-touch person to act out the anger and hostility for one's own deeply buried (but still perfectly alive) emotional wounds of childhood.  Incidentally, didn't the U.S. destruction of Iraq's infrastructure and economy (surely in part by Air Force bombing) leave something like a million or two Iraqi children destitute?  Sounds like abuse to me!  (Perhaps even worse than the Third Worst Case In California!)  And yet, does Dave Pelzer speak against that?  No, he brags about his \\"unique\\" accomplishments!	2001-08-19

I totally empathized with his hustling and lying at points to get ahead in a world so poised against him.  the main thing I liked about the book was his VERY HUMAN side, his compassion for himself, his pain he suffered at being poor, mostly fatherless, black, dirty, hungry, uneducated.  I loved it that he could cry, he could keep his humanity despite the world's cruelty...and not just keep it and feel it, but write about it later.<br />  Weak point:  the ending petered out.  It went from being a man's internal struggle to \\"make it\\" in the world - the place in which I found the book's power lay - to being just another typical civil rights journal.  And although I think the civil rights movement has its place, and Dick Gregory his place within it, I think I would have found the book far more satisfying it ended by its author turning further inward and exploring his own motives on his own purely personal journey, rather than outward to the struggle of society.  Perhaps he wasn't ready to write on this level when he published his memoir, as he was only 30 or 31 when he wrote it, but to me his lack of wisdom still doesn't let the book off the hook.	2001-08-05

Of course, Ive heard of the book for years, but for some reason always just assumed it would be dull.  Well, dull it was not!  It was really a beautiful story.  Actually, it took a little while to become beautiful, as its first hefty chunk, with Crusoe leaving England, travelling around the world, trying to become rich, becoming an adventurer and then a slave, it was all a little slowand perhaps fake.  But once he made it to his deserted island, THIS BOOK BECAME A TRUE WINNER!  His struggle to make it and survive and live a life of some quality and not go absolutely nuts from isolation and loneliness, it was a true gem, and for me, easy to relate to, despite the fact that defoe wrote it nearly 300 years ago.  I really did not expect much from this book, not nearly as much as I got.  I found the detail involved in his life on the island surprisingly welcome, and I found myself very caught up emotionally in crusoes struggle, and almost sick at the idea of him ALL ALONE on that island for decades.<br />  Books weak points (in my opinion):  I found almost everything on religion and morality in this book dull, and I skimmed over it.  it frankly didnt make sense to me how robinson crusoe, who was (or became) so enlightened in so many ways never could really see beyond the bounds of his petty little religion, as exemplified best (or worst) in his (...) conversion of Friday to christianity.  From the beginning of the book I found defoes/crusoes soliloquies on religion suspect, and I wondered if defoe himself was just putting them in to satisfy his audiences limited morality, to keep them off his trail, so to speak.  Or perhaps he put them in just to allow the book to pass the censors pensor to keep himself out of jailbut that deep down he didnt for a second buy all the religion crusoe supposedly espoused.  Perhaps Ill never know, but its just a feeling	2001-08-05

(and she forgets that SAYING NOTHING...i.e. not engaging...is a form of verbal communication too.)  the &quot;presupposition&quot; (she loves that word) she completely misses is that people don't always HAVE to stay (stuck) in verbally abusive relationships, and she never really suggests, either subtly or overtly, that people can leave.  her basic unspoken assumption is that you should stay and learn how to spar better verbally so as not to be verbally taken advantage of and trampled.  (rather a conservative point of view for a &quot;modern&quot; feminist, wouldn't you say?)<br />one other thing that irked me:  she often suggests that in times of real emotional attack the best verbal mode to enter into is &quot;computer&quot; mode.  psychologically, what she's suggesting is to pull one's emotions out of the interaction...to basically emotionally detach from the situation...and become an analytical computer that lacks a self.  the people who have really mastered this art into the marrow of their personalities have earned a label in psychology:  that of schizoid personality disorder.<br />i hate to say it, but i think this book is really a big crock, and while i did find parts of it engaging, as i think analyzing interactions to be fascinating, as a self-help book, which is really what it is, i found it to be USELESS!<br />other gripe:  she makes FAR TOO MANY stereotypes about men's and women's patterns of verbal interaction, and while she makes occasional attempts to demonstrate that such stereotypes are not always so, she still regularly falls back into them, suggesting she has an emotional bone to pick of her own.<br />and finally, a saying i love, that applies here:  &quot;don't argue with idiots...they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience...&quot;y, a saying i love, that applies here:  &quot;don't argue with idiots...they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience...&quot;	2001-07-27

(you might even say he speaks of the manic-depressive within us all, the bi-polar.)<br />book's weak point in the year 2001:  way too much boring detail.  i think i'm accustomed to a well-trimmed story that gets quickly to the point and doesn't dawdle in what feels like irrelevant detail.  but i suppose i have to remember that when mark twain was writing, there was no TV, not even radio, and his audiences were probably starved for such imaginitive detail.  because of the excess detail, i almost gave the book only four stars, but when taking the book's date into considering, i gave it five...	2001-07-19

It's a surprisingly powerful and universal story, as the little beagle really represents not only the boy's wounded inner self who he wished his shut-down parents would protect...but the wounded, neglected and abused inner selves within each of us.  The boy's love and protection of the beagle represents the parents we always wished we had had, and perhaps even thought (or still think) we had.<br />Book's weak point:  The author sacrificed potential emotional depth for the smiles and hugs of a happy ending.  I think a much more realistic ending would have been the father disregarding the feelings of his sensitive son and sending the dog back to the abusive owner, the mother not lifting a finger to protect her son's feelings, and the owner killing the dog as he promised all along.  Basically, I think the author didn't have the guts to do it, and thus be able to transmit a real message to the audience about how the world is - essentially how cruel and uncaring parents really can be.  The boy becoming aware of such things would have hurt (him and us), but would at least have been REAL and given us the base of potential from which to GROW and not just keep our heads in the sand, leading us further down the path of denial...and ultimately toward perpetuating the same patterns those parents did.  Only emotional honesty (as opposed to the fantasy ending of this book) will break such cycles.	2001-06-30

I know, you could argue that people don't read murder mysteries for emotional depth, but regardless, this book lacked it.  it's just junk food.  no substance.  well, though not entirely, because she does give out some insightful philosophy near the end, all about intuition versus experienced reasoning, etc., and about really understanding WHY a person does what he does, what really motivates someone.<br />my question:  why, deep inside Agatha Christie, would SHE write a book like this, and I'm convinced that she did because she was brilliant in the emotional sphere she ventured into in her life, but that she was so utterly blocked off from other parts of herself that she was unable to venture into them in her writing.  the result:  she wrote these kinds of books (well, I've only read one, but I'll assume they suffice for the rest) that looked at just a very SLIM part of the human experience...<br />also, I think psychologically this book is all unconsciously about the child overcoming the parent, which is a complete fantasy, the child in this case being Poirot and the parents being so many people - the deceptive murderer, the fancy and arrogant police.  it's a big ol' grandiose fantasy, and that, I think, is why so many people are drawn to it.  I admit, I liked it, and I felt pretty omnipotent reading it and identifying with Poirot...<br />one other point that irked me:  you know the real way this Poirot guy could have circumvented all the murders, and stopped them before even the first one happened?

She recognizes correctly that if she can prove that the atrocious behavior of the most vicious monster of the twentieth century was motivated by his own unresolved childhood trauma, then she will also prove that so too is everyone else's atrocious behavior.  Through the combination of her audacity, emotional insight, and analytic scholarly ability she most certainly succeeds, but the problem is, she still hasn't figured out how to explicate herself.<br /><br />Alice Miller's psyche is loaded with unresolved psychological trauma.  If it were not, she wouldn't have had the near-psychotic breakdown she did in the late 1980s or early 1990s when she entered primal therapy with an extremely manipulative therapist (despite having railed against manipulative, pedagogical forms of parenting and therapy years earlier in For Your Own Good).<br /><br />I quote from a 1995 interview, in which she refers to the eruption of her own unresolved trauma:  \\"At the end of these three weeks [of intensive therapy] my feelings were in a turmoil, so that I could not find sleep, that for the first time in my life I thought of suicide, and had anxiety verging on the psychotic.  I was already fearful of this therapy that robbed my organism of sleep, but I could nowhere escape it.\\"<br /><br />And two years after that she accepted that she would always remain at least partially subjugated to her unresolved trauma.  I quote the afterward of the 1997 edition of The Drama Of The Gifted Child:  \\"I spent a long time looking for a total exploration of my childhood history.  Now I see that this was hubris\\" [her italics].<br /><br />By labeling her desire to know herself fully as \\"hubris,\\" she sends a message to everyone that it is impossible to fully heal.  How wrong she is!<br /><br />Yet when she wrote For Your Own Good, Alice Miller believed consciously that she already was fully healed.  The only cracks in her armor were subtle.  Yet like Hitler - and everyone who remains at least partially unconscious - she defended against them.  In the preface to the book's original edition she went so far as to intone the blessings of her own son to patch up her denial.<br /><br />Page xvii:  \\"Countless conversations with my son, Martin Miller, played an equally important role in this learning process.  Again and again, he forced me to become aware of my unconscious compulsions, internalized during childhood and stemming from the upbringing common to my generation.  His full, clear account of his experiences is partially responsibly for my own liberation from the compulsions, a liberation that could be achieved only after I had developed an ear for the sophisticated and minute nuances of the pedagogical approach.  Before writing down many of the ideas developed here, I discussed them thoroughly with my son.\\"<br /><br />Can Alice Miller, perhaps the greatest writer of her generation to hear the child's truth behind his manifested behavior, truly not even consider the possibility that her own son might have some motive to protect his mother?<br /><br />Although Alice Miller is highly critical of pathological parents in theory, she fails to realize that in practice they remain the norm.  By focusing on the extremes of pathological parenting she lets most parents, however pathological they remain, off the hook.  But like all theorists who defend their own false selves, her primary motive is to let herself off the hook.<br /><br />She tacitly gives her approval to all parents who wish to procreate, yet cannot understand how inconsistent this is with her deepest message.  Again, she does this because she has not yet owned up to her own mistakes...because she has not yet owned up to what was done to her by her own parents.  And until she digs into the roots of this, and can bear to face and resolve the wounded Hitler within her - as we all mustdo if we wish to be true to ourselves - her vision will remain partially blocked and her message partially rotten.<br /><br />For this bit of wisdom I have the best of Alice Miller to thank.her - as we all must do if we wish to be true to ourselves - her vision will remain partially blocked and her message partially rotten.   <br /> <br />For this bit of wisdom I have the best of Alice Miller to thank.	2001-04-16

DIDN'T DO! he was exceedingly manipulative with her, and that had to be the most manipulative transcript of a therapy session i'd ever read. i mean, this guy's a master, and he totally disguises his own motives. also, he completely protected the parents at the expense of the daughter (though he was slippery enough about it to not make it look so), and ultimately, i believe, acted not at all in her best interest, and may have damaged her worse than she knew. and on top of all that, he did it in such a slimy way that she THANKED HIM PROFUSELY FOR IT AFTERWARDS!!! it was only six YEARS later that she realized...just a little bit...how far he'd gone in manipulating her...but she was still thanking him. he messed with her head in a big way.<br /><br />and by the way, the editors of the book \\"just play neutral\\" when it comes to Framo's behavior. this is sick stuff. but you read it and decide.	2001-04-08

(and incidentally, how &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;middle-class American&quot; is that goal?! - &quot;true love&quot; and &quot;romance&quot;!!)  what about deep inner exploration, being true to ourselves, having honest friendships not based on duplicity and power and money?<br />i guess i just question why an author chooses to write such a stellar book about such an emotionally shallow topic...unless at some level that's where he himself is at...	2001-03-11

I think anyone who previously thought Helen Keller was a happy and joyous woman would realize how mistaken that idea is.  although the reality of her triumph over hardship can never be diminished, and for that she will always be a model of inspiration, she strikes me as having been an often extremely sad, emotionally shut down and isolated woman...but mostly someone who lived behind a major false front and &quot;put on a happy face&quot; to survive.  strong points:  very well researched, clearly and carefully written, often insightful, not shying away from taboo topics (sexuality, alcoholism, child abuse), all in all quite readable<br />a quick gripe:  I feel Herrmann could have been more interpretive about the relationship between Helen and Annie.  while reading the book I often found myself feeling that Helen and Annie's relationship (and Helen herself) was far more disturbed - unbalanced - than even Herrmann was concluding.	2001-02-21

Also, I don't know why she didn't get into it, but she barely even touches upon her family issues, it's like, they're all but non-characters, and I think that's a major minus for the book.<br />Along these lines, by calling the book \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" and saying her \\"musical\\" life was interrupted at eighteen, it implies her life (which at that point was her family life) was okay and that she was really the victim of the mental health field.  Well, I would agree that she was the victim of the mental health field, but I would say they were actually the secondary victimizers - the real ones were her family, and by her not exploring that aspect in the slightest she simply lets them off the hook, and confuses the reader as to who's primarily at fault.  Even a few clear paragraphs or pages of scenarios about the sick truth of her family (and don't tell me they're not!) would have improved this book immensely.<br />Finally:  it strikes me that lacking the real oomph to explore her family issues and out them, kaysen turns the tone to a sort of semi-comedy, almost like she's making another futile protest against unlistening nurses and doctors.of semi-comedy, almost like she's making another futile protest against unlistening nurses and doctors.	2001-02-02

Yet Alice Miller, wonderful writer that she is, cannot fully absorb the significance of her own message.  This denial pervades her writing and weakens her book's impact.<br /><br />She spends over three hundred pages of Thou Shalt Not Be Aware showing how parents damage their children, yet she refuses to hold parents accountable.  (Page 58:  \\"[People cannot] grasp that I blame neither children nor parents.\\")  In effect, she, one of the 20th century's greatest trumpeters for the child's rights, herself creates a theory which abandons the full truth of the child.  Shying away from the strength of her message, she compromises as best she can, turns vague, and blames society instead.  Thus, the subtitle of the book:  \\"Society's Betrayal Of The Child.\\"<br /><br />It is not society that primarily betrays children.  It really is parents.  Yet Alice Miller, a parent of two children herself and a woman who never came close to processing her own unresolved grief from her own childhood - stemming from maltreatment by her own parents, not society - cannot accept that.  It is too painful.<br /><br />Thus it comes as no great surprise that years after writing this book, when she herself entered deep therapy to resolve her childhood traumas once and for all, her true past horrors surfaced and she suffered a near-psychotic breakdown.  A 1995 interview says it all:  \\"At the end of these three weeks my feelings were in a turmoil, so that I could not find sleep, that for the first time in my life I thought of suicide, and had anxiety verging on the psychotic.  I was already fearful of this therapy that robbed my organism of sleep, but I could nowhere escape it.\\"<br /><br />Yet between the time of undergoing this \\"therapy\\" and giving this interview, she touted her therapist, J. Konrad Stettbacher, as a brilliant theorist and discoverer of a \\"remarkably effective therapy method,\\" thus providing him with thousands of referrals, until, that is, she realized correctly that he had been manipulative and destructive with her and she quickly removed all mention of him from later editions of her books...and publicly repudiated him on the internet.<br /><br />Yet 95% of Thou Shalt Not Be Aware remains an accurate roadmap and fuel station on the path toward enlightenment.  So much of Alice Miller is fully enlightened.  However, if you aspire to become more enlightened than she is, this book will be partially toxic to you.<br /><br />For instance, she masterfully exposes Freud's 1897 abandonment of the truth of his patients' sexual abuse histories, yet out of guilt for betraying him and loyalty to loving him (i.e. the omnipotent parent) anyway, she dedicates this book's first edition to...him.<br /><br />And she spends countless pages beautifully - though not succinctly, as this book does ramble - deconstructing Freud's ludicrous drive theory to expose its basic flaws.  But then, on page 51, she writes this:  \\"When I wrote The Drama of the Gifted Child [her first and most famous book, which is anti-Freudian], I still believed my experiences as an analyst were compatible with Freud's drive theory...\\"  This is shocking, and shows how amazing insight and atrocious denial can co-exist in the same person's conscious mind.  This is Alice Miller in a nutshell.<br /><br />And then there is her intense anti-religiosity, and refusal to believe in God or support any form of therapy that does.  Yet in June of 2001, nearly twenty years after writing Thou Shalt Not Be Aware, she wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II in which she took on the tone of an enraptured, star-struck young girl begging yet another omnipotent parent figure to hear her point of view.  Had I not known beforehand that it was written by the ferocious and insightful Alice Miller I might not have believed it.<br /><br />I will quote a few lines of it here (and the full text is on her website):  \\"Open Letter to the Holy Father.  I take the liberty to write to You again...  ...I can't imagine that any other person in the world would have Your courage, Your credibility, as well as Your personal talent and God's grace to be able to speak up against an old tradition [of child abuse]...  If the Church continues to ignore the new scientific information and to stay silent about this issue in spite of the lessons of Jesus, who else can be asked to open the parents' eyes in order to prevent the blind escalation of violence.  I am sure that if my letters succeed to reach You personally You will not stay indifferent to the knowledge they are trying to pass on to you.  With my most profound respect, Alice Miller.\\"<br /><br />Yet she even predicts her own future capitulation in Thou Shalt Not Be Aware.  On page 209, she notes how often \\"individual analysts shrink in later life from their own findings and return to earlier ways of thinking they had already left behind.\\"  As she herself points out consistently, traumas that are not fully exhumed and resolved always find a way to manifest pathologically.<br /><br />Although part of Alice Miller speaks from her healed side, she continues to behave like the traumatized child some part of her remains.  On one hand she speaks the truth more forcefully and honestly than almost anyone else - and as such has legitimately inspired millions through her written word.  Yet at the same time she defends parts of her parents' pathologies at all costs.  This is her unconscious psychic defense against having another breakdown.  Thus, when reading her, we must be aware of her limits.  If you are not, then...thou too shalt also not be aware.few lines of it here (and the full text is on her website):  \\"Open Letter to the Holy Father.

(actually, not that odd of a story - i think there are lots of people in our towns and cities in the year 2001 who are that isolated...) but just imagine, being left alone on an island for eighteen years?  sounds like hell to me.  i really admire her for surviving and not giving up hope.  one question:  why did she give up so quickly on building a new canoe and paddling for the mainland after just one failure?  she had the capacity to make a good canoe, and she was strong and brave, right?  i mean, she spent like three years just trying to spear an octopus for fun, so to me it just doesn't make sense.	2001-01-10

I actually wrote a review some time back saying how much I loved this book and how wonderful I thought its philosophy was, but now I have my problems with it.  I think the main one is that it and the program it pushes is not geared for doing deeper inner work, the work that will really set a person free.  And not just that.  If you really follow the AA program by the letter of the word, which is exactly what this book recommends, then it goes directly against doing the deepest of inner work.  Perhaps this is actually a wise philosophy for many alcoholics and other deeply troubled people in the short-term, because the deep inner work can really throw people for a loop, bring out the truest insanity and horrors from within...but...but what is life unless we know our truest inner selves...and what is recovery unless we heal at our deepest levels?<br />I would be less likely to criticize this book if I thought AA was the only way to get sober, but I think no one who has really healed at their deepest levels - who has taken on the biggest demons - would remain addicted to alcohol, because alcoholism only serves the purpose of staying numb and shut down.  Although I have not drunk alcohol for a long time - and value this sobriety - I have come to realize just how un-sober life without alcohol can still be, and this book makes sobriety from alcohol look like an end in and of itself - a pinnacle of healing.  It isn't.<br />This book says &quot;turn it over to god.&quot;<br />I say:  &quot;go into your deepest traumas with a safe guide...and really attempt the possibility of healing.&quot;<br />This book says:  &quot;take a moral inventory.&quot;<br />I say:  &quot;scrap all the morality...take an emotional inventory, for that's where the real truth of our horrors lie...and the truth of our brightest beings.&quot;<br />This book says:  &quot;put your faith in a God, a higher power.&quot;<br />I say:  &quot;enter your deepest traumas, get help to resolve them, and then open up the possibility of putting true faith in yourself.&quot;<br />This book never questions what makes an alcoholic.  It's almost as if it's saying:  &quot;an alcoholic can neither be created nor destroyed.&quot;  For me, this is the flaw of AA recovery. Childhood traumas create alcoholics.  And healing these traumas with heal the need to become alcoholic.  This book says:  &quot;accept the fact that you always were and always will be an alcoholic.&quot;  It's actually an odd sort of terror philosophy that tells people they can never really heal, that they're crippled with a lifelong affliction.
