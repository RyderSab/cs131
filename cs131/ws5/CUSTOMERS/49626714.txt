US	49626714	RS3SXCNWJTWC5	0743222245	376327637	Living History	Books	4	4	8	N	N	full of fascinating details	The book has disappointingly little about Hillary's life before she became famous.  Also missing are meaty, flowery descriptions of anything.  This is a pretty overwhelming collection of trivia.<br /><br />Most of the text focuses on Hillary as First Lady.  In some sense this is two books.  One part focuses on big political issues like health care reform and the Ken Starr investigation.  The other is a travel log, documenting fascinating trips and meetings.  The frustrating thing is switching back and forth between the two.  It's a bit like dealing with a split personality.  Perhaps it would have been better to write two volumes: one full of political essays and advocacy, and the other full of charming stories about all the wonderful things she did.<br /><br />She tends to describe feelings and settings in a few words.  This has lead some readers to think she's very tight-lipped and political.  I wonder instead to what extent she even dwells on what she is experiencing.  Perhaps she's just too busy to have much internal life.  Maybe she's not hiding anything at all.  Maybe she's not reflective, but rather action-oriented.<br /><br />I get the impression of a woman very much in love with her husband, very protective of her daughter, fiercely loyal to the people who work for her, and acutely sensitive to political complexities.  Sometimes she seems reluctant to reveal herself.  Other times she's startlingly candid, like when she throws up in a Russian limo.<br /><br />Later, perhaps when she retires, I hope we'll get some more leisurely, reflective articles about what all those trips and meetings were like.<br /><br />On the whole, the book is very worthwhile reading, and packed full of useful, educational information.	2004-12-26

You'll want to bone up on your vocabulary.<br /><br />The book has all kinds of creative ideas for how to have sexual interactions, while minimizing danger.<br /><br />As a person who has had several very close friends die of AIDS, I am very grateful for all the information I can get.  Being squeamish, or denying that the problem exists is not the solution.  This book is a great first step in learning about issues and options.	2004-12-26
US	49626714	R3IDA4QWPYC3R3	0886777828	56538478	The Dreaming Tree	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Gloomy and drags	This book has a lot of interesting concepts.  It uses some traditional Celtic mythology and some traditional Celtic & Old English words.  It hypothesizes the world of faery as a parallel world into which the \\"Sidhe\\" can appear and disappear at will; and the land of the Lord of Death as a similar parallel world.  The approach is almost evocative of science fiction.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the magical world is an extremely gloomy place, where everything seems to be falling apart.  There is a constant sense of foreboding -- undending crisis that never seems to be resolvable.  The fact that this is 2 books together increases this impression, since each book has its own hero who is conducting his own life's battle in almost the same context.  I found myself wondering whether we were ever going to get past the situation, or whether the children described near the end were just going to be a reincarnation of the two prior heroes.<br /><br />The ending seems to be pulled out of nowhere.<br /><br />There seems to be no real romance to the thing.  It's more about mysterious battles and marriages of political convenience.  Sometimes it's even a bit hard to figure out what is going on.	2004-09-12

It doesn't matter if you like it or not. You're going to have to read it.  The only way to not read it is to not read Lirael.<br />Now there are some good points here.  The character development is improving.  You start to have a feel for them all, know where they stand. You get to meet the Gods of this world & a lot of it is very poetic.  The names of the Gods are graceful.  The land of the dead is captivating as well as suspenseful.  The familiar animals, Mogget & the Disreputable Dog, are a nice sort of comic relief.<br />Unfortunately, the fields of destruction and death are pretty overwhelming.  And, once again, the main characters can't turn around or take a breath without coming face to face with a zombie, in true video game like quality.  I find this constant attack, attack, attack pretty dismal after a while.<br />And, of course (though this may be a spoiler) much like Sabriel, the ending is very abrupt.  I would have liked to linger longer and savor some of it, but no.  It's just over.<br />Speaking of spoilers, the editorial review reveals the name and identity of the secret bad guy who isn't revealed until near the end of the book.  How dare they!  A lot of this book is about mystery about who is being fought & what the enemy wants.  These guys need about 1000 lashes with a wet noodle.	2004-07-13

He keeps running into those masses of zombies (\\"Dead\\") all the time and when he's not outside, he's moping around his castle being picked on by his sister, which is better than running around outside with the zombies, but pretty tedious.<br />The second line, about Lirael, is *much* better.  Lirael is exploring this great library full of magic creatures and magic books.  She's trying out all kinds of things and becoming more and more powerful.  Granted she has a nasty case of depression, but she gets through it and builds herself up to be truly exciting.  I think the sequence of Lirael in the library makes the book worth while.  I could have stayed in that library forever.<br />This is a bit of a spoiler, so you might want to stop reading at this point.<br />Anyway, the bad thing is that Lirael gets out of the library and then she's out there with all those zombies and Sameth.  And there are more and more of the putrid things.  The more she kills, the more there are.  It's the ultimate sisyphean task. This series is kind of like the story of a bunch of glorified exterminators who spend their lives ridding the world of disgusting and dangerous pests.  Unfortunately, I was reading the book in a cockroach infested dormitory, which did not help.<br /><br />Still, the book has good suspense, a real page-turner, and a lot of the stuff is very creative, not at all like other fantasy books.  The land of death that Nix creates is very unusual.<br />On the whole, I recommend the book.<br />Warning: the ending is a cliff hanger.  You might as well just buy the whole series together.  It's not very likely you're going to be able to walk away from all this suspense without finding out what happened.	2004-07-13

The suspense never lets up.<br />It's also quite creative in its own way.  it posits a world with two countries side by side.  In one country there is magic, but technology doesn't work.  In the other country, there is technology, but magic doesn't work.  Now, curiously, the magic country is *not* where you want to be.  In the magic country, the place is being taken over by zombies (called \\"Dead\\"), since all dead bodies come back to life unless the Abhorsen properly disposes of them.  Totally gross.  It's kind of like \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"  Also, most of the magic people are mysteriously devoted to bringing back more and more zombies and killing the living.  It's very hard to understand their motivation to do this, but there it is.<br />The few people on the border in the non-magic country are constantly fighting to keep the zombies out of their territory.<br />Now the negatives:<br />I mean really, why would you want to have a magic country if almost all the magic is bad?  This isn't escapist at all.  It's makes you feel pretty good about your own life.<br />Also, the thing reads like a video game.  Every time the main characters turn around there's another zombie or other bad, magic creature bearing down who has to be killed instantly, otherwise, you know, the boogie man will get you if you don't watch out.  There's just no respite.  I don't like even looking briefly at that kind of video game.<br />There's also precious little character development.  It's all rushing around from one violent encounter to another.<br />Now some people seem to think that if you're only killing zombies, magical creatures, and wicked necromancers who are possessed baddies, it's not really killing somehow.  I disagree.  It's still violence, violence, and nothing but violence.<br />Then, the ending ... I won't give it away entirely, but this might be a bit of a spoiler.  Anyway, you don't really get to enjoy it.  It's awfully abrupt.<br />Another bad thing.  It's so suspenseful that you have to get the other two, so just grit your teeth & get all three.It's awfully abrupt.<br />Another bad thing.

It was a combination of three books having a common theme.  In each book, human beings find themselves in an alien or sci-fi environment that has a profound effect on their thinking, making them alien, too.  The author is excellent at helping you enter the minds of these strange, altered people.<br />These are profoundly intellectual books, examining thought processes in great detail.  Sometimes not too much happens, except an examination of what the characters are thinking, perhaps a tiny bit reminiscent of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.  I found this fascinating, but I wouldn't expect that it would be very interesting for children, for instance.<br />In the first book, two sets of people are trapped together on a space ship.  One set are normal, born people.  The other set were made in a lab and conditioned to serve the first group.  Most of the book takes place inside the head of one of these lab born servants and looks at how she experiences people and events around her.<br />In the second book, a group of people end up in the clutches of an alien computer, who plays strange games with them, copying and combining them.<br />In the third book, a group of human colonists lives on a planet with an alien race, but somehow convinces themselves that they don't see the aliens right in front of their faces.  The story examines the bizarre thought patterns they go through in rationalizing their denial of the aliens.<br />It's hard in summarizing these books to capture a feeling of what the stories are really like.  They all move at a good clip and keep up suspense, so you keep wanting to read on, despite the fact that the approach is so intellectual.<br />Cherryh is an incredibly creative writer.  Her work is totally different from any other science fiction that I have read.  It is true science fiction from the old school (rather than fantasy) and yet also has an approach somewhat like a romance novel in the detailed look at people's internal lives.<br />I am definitely getting more books by this author.rnal lives. <br />I am definitely getting more books by this author.	2004-06-03

I was absolutely glued to it.<br />This trilogy is quite liberal socially.  The women are effective warriors and often the leaders while the men typically follow.  Gay relationships are accepted as equal with straight ones.  One of the lead good guys is gay.<br />It's really neat how Elspeth and Darkwind work together as a team romantically, magically, and militarily.  Sigh.  I wish I had a relationship like that.  Of course, it's probably just as unrealistic as the magic.  Probably the ending is unrealistically happy as well, but then you sort of expect that in this type of book.  At least it's not depressing.<br />I still think there are entirely too many super-powerful mages and adepts running around in the world of these books.  You sort of get to the point where you think adepts (the most powerful of the magical people) are normal and everyone else is stunted.<br />I liked all the beautiful, powerful animals and animal-like sentient characters.  They are very rich and diverse.	2004-05-15

Those using magic seem to be as likely to be evil and sinister as they are to be good. The learning of magic has become a training routine, not unlike military bootcamp, except smaller in scale.<br />On the downside, I must say there is something remarkably unappealing about magic being so common place.  The whole double meaning of magic in English is something that is supernatural and also special.  In this book, magic becomes a natural underground phenomenon that people can tap into, sort of like drilling a well.  Somehow well drilling doesn't seem very exciting.<br />On the upside, the book flows very nicely and really holds your attention.  The characters are attractive, varied, and well-developed.  The setting is interesting.  This whole trilogy is a cliffhanger thing.  Don't plan to buy only one of the books in the series.  Just plan to buy all three.<br />The books in this trilogy are quite sexual, including gay theme material.  Prudish people should not buy these, nor should you buy them for pre-pubescent children.  Personally, though, I liked this aspect of the book.<br />This book is very feminist.  The main women are warriors and mages.  The men are somewhat de-emphasized, and all the villains seem to be men.  Also on the downside for me (as a middle aged person), the middle aged people are also de-emphasized and weak, while the young people are strong and dominant.	2004-04-30

The young, feisty princess is threatened by an evil king and goes out on a quest to find magic.  She fails to follow the advice of those older and wiser and acts rather stupidly rebellious.<br />Fortunately, she didn't suffer quite the expected downfall and retribution for her behavior, which was sort of a relief.  I don't think I would have enjoyed reading about her being tortured by the bad guy; and, fortunately, the tortures that others have suffered at his hand are only summarized briefly.<br />This book is very, very sexual.  If they put ratings on books, I think I would give it an NC-17.  S&M stuff and incest appear fairly often -- pretty disgusting, even though it's only the bad guy who perpetrates this junk.  Unfortunately, they don't put ratings on books, and my 13 year old read it.  Fortunately, the stuff is expressed sufficiently metaphorically that most of it went over his head -- at least I hope so.  The love scene between Darkwind & Dawnfire, though more traditional, was VERY titillating.<br />On the upside of this, though, is that the bad guy's evil sexuality is pretty creative.  I don't think that I've seen anything quite like it in a book.  I just wish there were some warning, so I could keep it out of the hands of my kid.<br />The suspense is pretty good, but there are some places that drag a bit.<br />The second book is better, though still kinky.	2004-04-30

This was exactly up my alley.<br />In this book, Alice Martin meets her favorite movie star, Gem, in an elevator.  Then they get stuck in a black out.  Alice gets injured escaping from the elevator and Gem gets her to a doctor.<br />During the process she gives him a plot squib for a sequel to one of his movies.  He decides it's good enough to go forward with.  She writes him a script and works with him on the movie.<br />During the filming, they meet a handicapped child who they end up adopting together.  Adopting the child together leads to a lifelong friendship and collaboration.<br />Alice writes and directs more movies for Gem.  Ultimately, he becomes interested in her.  The romantic part starts about halfway through the book.<br />Warning: some of this novel is kinky.  It also has humor and some paranormal aspects.<br />The movie plot squibs were really good.  I wish someone would make movies of at least one or two of them.<br />This is not your usual novel about physically beautiful young people longing after each other's sexuality.  Gem starts out gorgeous, but ends up having serious health problems that leave him less attractive.  It is a novel about two middle-aged people who find themselves strongly atttracted to each other, because they are true soul mates.  It's not a lust thing.	2004-03-28

They can re-incarnate themselves.  They are ruling a planet inhabited by their descendants, whom they keep in the stone age.<br />The problem is that it's almost incomprehensible. Most of the book is apparently a flashback, but the transition to the past is confusing, and there are references to an even further past, so you can never tell what time period you are in.  It appears that only the first and last chapters are the present time.<br />Most of the characters are confusing, too.  They appear without introduction or development and it's hard to remember who is who or why they relate to each other.  A lot of these characters have super powers, but the powers are not well explained, so when they have battles it's hard to figure out who is doing what or why.<br />There are quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  Some of them purport to be out of Hindu or possibly Buddhist scriptures.  I wondered whether they really were scriptures.  If so, why does the story parallel real scriptures?  The description of the book on the cover says that these are people who came from a long-vanished Earth; BUT the book doesn't say that at all.  You wonder whether instead the book is hypothesizing a science fiction explanation for the Hindu religion here on earth.<br />The connections between chapters are also confusing, so that the story line is even harder to follow.<br />It's also hard to follow the motivations of the main character, Sam.  This is possibly because it's never clear which when he is in.<br />You have to wonder what happened to the concept of editors.	2004-01-25

This book served the marvelous purpose of sucking my children into reading the whole series.  My older son was quite intimidated by the size of the main books, until this one came out, when he was about 10.  He loved all the trivia in here and lept on to the larger books with alacrity so he could find all of the animal characters in them.  It made Harry Potter seem like Pokemon to him.  The younger one followed his older brother's example and became an even more enthusiastic fan.<br />I just have one little gripe.  The book is out of date.  It lacks descriptions of some of the main magical creatures in the series, e.g. blast ended skrewts, thestrals, and the serpent who is Voldemort's companion.  A new edition is in order.  Now such an edition might seem a bit tricky, because the other was supposed to be the edition with Harry Potter's handwritten notations in the margin, but the necessity for the new edition could easily be attributed to a magical printer's error.	2003-12-23

When I saw the book on the library shelf, I almost felt as if this was a personal friend, since I'd gotten his letter.  I feel even more that way having read this delightful book.<br />The first part of this book is about the author's childhood in Afghanistan.  He weaves a lyrical myth out of his memories.  The paperback version has a lovely addendum about his returning to Afhanistan.<br />The author also contrasts living in a clan to his basement office in California.  There arises a clear dialectic between freedom and potential loneliness in the US on the one hand and having connectedness with a clan in Afghanistan, but considerably less freedom (particularly for women), on the other.  This is a fascinating thing for Americans to think about.<br />The second part of the book was about the author's experiences in the US and as an adult travelling through Muslim countries. We learn that the Ansary surname designates a descendant of the people who helped Mohammed escape from Medina.  Reading this Ansary's writings, I wonder if he will help Islam escape from the clutches of those horrible fundamentalists.  Ansary has very interesting information about the historical roots of fundamentalism in Islam and dissenters from that fundamentalism.  He explains how one can be Muslim and not fundamentalist.<br />The writing quality is excellent: flowing, congenial, sometimes ironic, often deeply sincere, and with a certain innocence and idealism that is particulary wonderful in a middle aged man.  Ansary has the ability to enjoy a great diversity of people, not feeling overly judgmental about any of them.  The book is also mercifully short, despite being chock full of information.  I never got bored.	2003-08-29

It also deals with how people recover from loss and overcome adversity.<br />Despite it's being a children's picture book, it's definitely meaty material.  It deals with a world that is not at all like a fairy tale, where people are struggling with real problems.  I like that.  I like letting kids see that happiness doesn't necessarily come from being a rich person or having everything go right.  Happiness comes from working hard and reaching out to others.<br />I recommend this book most heartily.	2003-07-20
US	49626714	RJSVNBHIESJ3R	0440236754	930294466	Sunset in St. Tropez	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Blah	I was looking for a nice little romance to escape with and I was in O'Hare airport with nothing much to do.  I saw this on the shelf &amp; that this author had sold hundreds of millions of books.  I figured that many people couldn't be wrong.  Hmm.<br />The first thing that turned me off right away was that there was a character with the same first name as mine.  Unfortunately, this character fares extremely poorly in the book.  I suppose it's not really fair of me to dislike the book for that.  I mean the character who does worst in the book has to have some name, but I just couldn't let it go. So much for escape from my own problems.<br />Another thing that annoyed me was that one of the characters was characterized as a &quot;superior court judge&quot; in New York City.  Now, if you know anything about law in New York, you know that there is no such position in New York State.  The position that corresponds to &quot;superior court judge&quot; in other states is called &quot;supreme court justice&quot; here.  (The court that we have that would be called &quot;supreme court&quot; in other states is called &quot;court of appeals.&quot;)  Why does New York have to be different like this?  Who knows?  But then everyone always knew New York was different from the rest of the coutnry.  Now you may say that this is a petty point, but it seems to me that, if you're an author with a big following and you know you might have yet another best-selling book and you know a lot of your book is going to be set in New York City, you could bother to research these things just a tad just so, in case some of your readers ever go looking for a court in New York City, they might end up in the right place.<br />Now sitting back from my personal vendetta, I have to say that it was a light and easy read, so I suppose I got a bit of an escape from it.  The reading level here is probably barely fifth grade. The characters were pretty well developed, using short, uncomplicated sentences.  There weren't any complicated concepts here.  I would say Harry Potter is probably a more challenging read.  Still, the thing kept my attention, mostly because it was short and I just sailed on through.<br />It was nice that the characters were happy, older people.

There were exciting landscapes & buildings, funny magical creatures, a school that everyone would want to attend, etc.  Harry, a Dickensonian type orphan, was able to escape to this world and find friends, prizes, and glory.  The writing was in a charming, chatty style, that lingered lyrically on the better parts of the wizarding world.  Leisurely descriptions were intermingled with tightly written suspense and action.  Ahh...<br />Now JK Rowling is richer than the Queen of England, has a new marriage and a new baby.  Now she feels free to explore the darker side of this magical world and Harry's adolescent crisis.  She also is feeling somewhat burdened by the pressure to get these books out.  The result?  Harry is in a bad temper.  He has too much homework.  Not only do the Dursley's torture him, he is tortured in detention.  He snaps at his friends.  They bicker with each other.  He feels terribly sorry for himself.  He is misunderstood.<br />There are few if any funny, happy scenes in this book.  Harry wins no prizes and gets no glory.  Fortunately, at least Ron does, which is nice.<br />Unlike JK Rowling, I have not passed into a better life.  I was still hoping for a beautiful escape.  The beginning of this book was so dismal I almost gave up on it.  Though, having waited so long for it, I had to plug along.<br />The action did start really picking up in Chapter 16, so I was glad I had continued.<br />The writing style for the action parts is still nice and tight -- definitely a page turner.  Unfortunately, the leisurely descriptions are reserved for Harry being tortured rather than for romantic views of the castle or charming magical creatures.  You can't criticize Rowling's style at all.  She's a great writer.  She's just in a different place from me now.<br />I hope this isn't a spoiler, but the ending is hardly happy.  In an interview, JK Rowling asked a reporter about Harry, \\"What makes you think he'll survive?\\"  I'm not sure anyone took her seriously at the time, but after this book you'll certainly have to.  If you are reading this to a young child, you may want to read ahead and reconsider.  I can imagine some kids being upset.<br />Sigh.<br />I think I'm still hooked.  I'll have to find out what happens in the next ones.<br />JK:  Please don't kill Harry, Ron or Hermione off.  OK?  PLEEEEZE!!!<br />Addendum:  The book does have some useful parts for teaching kids about dealing with anger.In an interview, JK Rowling asked a reporter about Harry, \\"What makes you think he'll survive?\\"  I'm not sure anyone took her seriously at the time, but after this book you'll certainly have to.

This one manages to develop an incredible number of distinct, contrasting characters, including alien characters of four species, with depth and believability.<br />Perhaps Faded Sun qualifies as a typical womens book, because between moments of action there are long, intense periods of examination of the feelings of the various characters.  It is totally different from many science fiction books, such as the Star Wars spinoffs.  The latter flit from one incident of hand to hand combat to another, with only a hint of plot thread in between serving as an excuse for the combat, just the opposite of Faded Sun where combat is a link between the looking inside of heads.<br />Well, I'm a woman and not ashamed to prefer a woman's book, if that's what this is.  I was particularly glad to see strong female characters in leadership roles.<br />While Faded Sun does have many incidents of extreme violence, it nevertheless retains a basic orientation toward peacemaking.  Primarily it is a study of people struggling to understand aliens and vice versa, while each tries to preserve the interests of his or her own group.  Since I was a high school exchange student in a foreign country, I particularly empathized with those human characters who tried to immerse themselves in alien cultures and thereby enhance interspecies communication.<br />The ability of the humans to so immerse becomes their unique strength in the quest for peace.  The perspective on humans expressed in Faded Sun is remarkably uplifting.  All of the humans seem to be unusually sensible and self-sacrificing.  Perhaps this is not realistic, but it is very nice to see a book that does not have any true villains.  Even the most repulsive aliens are portrayed with remarkable sympathy.  The death and destruction that occur in this work all stem out of the characters conflicting world views, not from inherent wickedness.  I like this, because I think this is the way conflict really arises in our own world.<br />In short, this book is real literature, not just pulp science fiction.<br />I treasured every moment of this long trilogy.  I cannot imagine how the sub-books could have been published individually, because they seem to hang together so much better as one.  I would definitely not recommend buying the individual sub-books separately, because the first two have very unsatisfying, cliff-hanging endings; while the trilogy has a good, strong ending.<br />Still, there is enough suspense left that there could be sequels.  I hope so, if they're as good as this.this, because I think this is the way conflict really arises in our own world. <br />In short, this book is real literature, not just pulp science fiction.  <br />I treasured every moment of this long trilogy.

I think it's the last one, though ... so sad.  I really want to find out what happened next.<br />This book is just so sophisticated in its character development!  I love the way MZB looks at interpersonal relationships.  What makes a person turn bitter, negative and destructive -- and how can she escape from that?  What makes another person become dominant and powerful?  How can a woman who is under the domination of a male chauvinist society nevertheless manage to have a meaningful life? How do children evolve in their thinking as they become teenagers and separate from their parents?  What happens when a large number of strong personalities are confined together in a huge castle for years?  These are the kinds of issues that are dealt with in this book.<br />I particularly like the way this elaborate character development is combined with the sci fi/fantasy aspects.  How does a primitive world of telepaths retain its cultural integrity in the face of a much larger and more powerful galactic technoculture?  How does telepathy influence human relationships?  What kind of adjustments does a society of telepaths have to make to avoid going crazy?  I love how this series and particuarly this book deal with all that.<br />And, of course, there is the wonderful, continuing romance of Mikhail and Marguerida, which has matured so heartwarmingly along with them.  It's so rare to see a novel that takes a romance into adulthood.  Most romance novels end with marriage.  This novel accepts the challenge of addressing a romance that continues.  OK, maybe this is the most fantastical element of the book, but I liked it anyway.<br />I recommend this book most heartily.	2003-05-17

For instance, I love &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; and Harry Potter...  so, I was very hopeful for this one.<br />Unfortunately, I found the writing clunky.  It just didn't have the charming, lyrical style that I would hope for in this genre.<br />The contrived romance that popped out of nowhere at the very end was disappointing.  It seemed to have been added just for the heck of it, I guess because the original fairy tale had one.<br />Still, the book was tolerable and had some good plot elements.  I am hoping that I will find another book in this series that will use the elemental master concept and the undines &amp;c. in the context of some better writing.	2003-05-17

This one wasn't as good, but still ok.<br />The beginning was tedious for me.  I don't like reading about gang members who live in putrescent urban conditions and speak like retards.  I also don't like futuristic novels where everything has gone wrong and gloomy.  Moreover, the character development was not too good, at least at the start.<br />Fortunately, the whole book was not like that.  While things started out being fairly confusing, they started hanging together better as I went along.  I kind of had to force myself to stick with it, mostly because I liked her other books, but I was glad by the time I finished.  The ending, which I won't reveal, was extremely creative and transformative.	2003-05-17

I knew this was a kids' book, but it seemed to be the most interesting and recent biography of Tom Cruise, based on the reviews that I looked at on this website.  I am a very big Tom Cruise fan, so I decided to take the risk.<br />I was a bit shocked to find out that the customer review on this website that claimed that Cruise had made punnish errors in reading movie titles seems to have been entirely fabricated.  I don't understand why something like that isn't removed from the site.<br />The book was ok.  I learned some things about Cruise's career.  There were some nice photos. Still, it wasn't an adult book.  I would have liked something more meaty and in depth.  I guess that would be hard to write, since he's not a person who likes to reveal intimate details about himself.  I suppose eventually some person in his entourage will start talking and we'll actually find out something about him.  We'll just have to be patient.<br />This would be a good book to give to a child who is dyslexic and feeling discouraged about learning to read, though.	2003-05-17

My husband got into them first, but they're spreading to the rest of us.  These books are mostly real page turners, full of action and suspense; but, nevertheless, they have marvelous character development with tremendous complexity in how the characters think, feel, and interact.<br />There is some wonderful philosophy sprinkled throughout about the nature of marriage and of gender roles in society.  The fantasy and telepathic aspects of the books make for intriguing variations on what leads to dominance in relationships and what leads to successful and unsuccessful relationships, whether between husband and wife; parent and child; or between siblings.<br />This book shares these nice features with many others in the series.<br />My older son, age 12, is a strong reader and loves reading adult science fiction and fanatasy.  He has picked up on these books and started stealing them out of my husband's bookcase and loving them.  For the most part, I think that's o.k. for the Darkover series, BUT NOT FOR THIS BOOK!  It's too bad that books don't have ratings like software or movies.  This one is definitely R or possibly NC-17.  For myself, I enjoyed the explorations of how telepathy would affect sex myself -- some of which got pretty darn strange; BUT it's not the sort of thing that my pre-pubescent child, who is already pretty confused about sex roles as it is, should be reading.	2002-12-27

Even grown ups will want to take a lot of time to study the intricacies of these pictures.  The clothing depicted is especially interesting and beautiful.<br />The story is sweet, with a redemption rather than punishment ending.  I always prefer when a children's story has a redemption ending.  That's a better message to give our children: that everyone can be reformed if given the right opportunities.<br />You'll just get a really happy, warm feeling from this book.<br />Christmas Trolls is also suitable for very small children.	2002-12-03

Reading through this book was like lazily drifting down the Delaware River in Northern New Jersey in a kayak: just effortless, total pleasure.<br />The book does not really let you know any deep dark inner secrets about John F. Kennedy, Jr., though there are hints of things through his actions and statements.  The book is more about what was it was like for Blow to work with JFK, Jr.  That was fine with me, because that's what I usually wonder, what it would be like to be around JFK, Jr.<br />I had one frustration with the book.  It wasn't too detailed about observations of John's facial expressions and tones of voice.  I got the impression of Blow as a person who was trying to look away from John rather than at John.  Blow even says as much, that he was trying to avoid getting in too close to John, because doing so seemed to get people in trouble.  That reminded me of a movie I once saw about George III of England, which showed that the king ultimately valued employees who knew how to keep a certain distance rather than those who got up too close and personal, even if the latter were very nice.<br />Be sure to check out the photo of the author.

The USA did not make it easy for them to get in.  Our society was extremely anti-semitic itself at that time.  As a result, only the most promising people managed make the jump.<br />Walter Meyerhof, who was the son of a Nobel prize winning scientist and who later went on to become a physics professor at Stanford, was one who made it out and made it here.  Like many refugees, he was not actually Jewish, but had Jewish ancestry.<br />The book consists of a number of short vignettes about Meyerhof's life.  The vignettes are not really connected into a single narrative as one would expect from a biography, still one does get a picture of the flow of his life.<br />The book's account of Meyerhof's flight from Hitler is understated, but the sense of the closing of the horrifying vice of death still comes through.<br />Meyerhof's tales of his encounters with romance are also fascinating in giving us a window into how such things happened even before the \\"free love\\" generation.<br />The book does leave us with many questions about the parts of the author's life that are missing.  Still, the parts that are there are well worth reading.	2002-06-16

Then I forked over an awful lot of money for the bird plus various other things, including this book -- all non-refundable, of course.<br />I suspect that if I had read this book first I might not have made this purchase -- because now that I've read the book I have learned that my cuddly baby may grow into a vicious adult who may mutilate my face or take out an eye if I dare to let its eyes get above my mouth!  Lovely thought.  (Shiver)<br />Well, since the purchase WAS non-refundable, the bird and I are stuck with each other.  That all being a given, it's probably a good thing I have the book.  It's easy to read; has lots of great illustrations; and some pretty easy to understand advice.  I hope the result will be that the bird never does become a bloodthirsty monster.<br />The only thing that is bothering me is the towel game -- described fairly early on in the book -- that is supposed to be critical to preventing the bird from becoming vicious.  I'm finding the explanation of how to do it difficult to understand.  This is making me all neurotic about whether I am going to be able to keep my bird tame.	2002-05-19

They're light-hearted, easy to read, upbeat, funny, and suspenseful without being really scary.  All of the characters, whether good or bad, are sympathetic. This one fits right in.<br />This novel has some great premises, e.g. that there is something about Xanth's magic that prevents married couples from falling out of love and that, in Xanth, women's panties have a mysterious magic.<br />I would have given it five stars, but there were some very heavy pun clusters that dragged it down.  If you don't know Xanth, you should understand that the magic of Xanth is largely based on puns.  I'm not the world's biggest pun fan, but still some the punning is a lot of fun.  In this book, though, there were sections where you just hit one pun after another and it was pretty rough going.  I like it better when there is just a light sprinkling of puns.<br />Another slight problem is name dropping of familiar characters from earlier books.  There have been enough books, now, that it's really hard to keep track of all the characters.  Maybe there should be a little chart in each book, tracing the royal family lines, at least, or which characters were introduced in which books.<br />A good thing about Xanth novels is that each character is presented with a challenge that is suitable for that character's level of accomplishment.  The characters have to struggle to win, but the struggle is appropriate to them and makes them grow.<br />I am not sure I like the Nimby character as much as some of the previous ones.  He's just too powerful.  It kind of tips the balance toward him too much.  P. Anthony does a good job of putting him in situations where he is nevertheless challenged, despite his seemingly overwhelming power.  Still, there is something a bit too close to God about Nimby that makes me uncomfortable.	2002-04-30

My brother-in-law got me this one after I had recently re-read all my old ones.  The kids having finally gotten interested in Xanth got me going on my re-reading project.<br />I don't think this one measures up.  It doesn't flow like the others and you don't get into the story.  Maybe it's because there are too many main characters, so that none of them can be developed very well. They all run off in different directions and it's hard to keep track of what is going on or what the characters are like.<br />Maybe it's because, while the earlier stories were essentially cheery, this one has an underlying gloominess throughout.<br />When certain ones of the characters are announced to be in love, it seems like sort of an afterthought.  You just don't get inside anyone's head enough to really empathize with them, so there's not enough buildup that would justify the characters' feelings.<br />The puns don't seem to be as good as they used to be either.<br />I don't think I'm just becoming jaded, because I was reading the earlier ones again to my kids at the same time I was reading this one and the earlier ones just seem better.	2002-04-25

My husband and I read this book to the 11 year old, but I also read it to myself.<br />In this book, the protagonist travels back and forth through time to change history to try to prevent a catastrophe.  The changes must be very subtle to avoid paradox.  The story line is complex because the reader must keep track of many generations of two branches of the same family.  The story is very suspenseful because bad spirits are constantly trying to kill the protagonist, or prevent his success.<br />The book has good points and bad points.<br />On the good side:<br />1. The book presents a peace loving and anti-racist point of view;<br />2. It also makes a fascinating exploration of historical rumors that when British colonists first arrived in the southern part of the US they found a tribe of Welsh-speaking Native Americans with some Caucasian features; and<br />3. I enjoyed the complexity, but you really had to pay very close attention, or you got lost -- like my husband did.<br />On the bad side:<br />1. I did not like the idea that, starting from two brothers, the descendents of the bad brother would be bad and the descendents of the good brother would be good over several hundred years and a large number of generations.  Each person makes his or her own destiny and decisions of right and wrong.  It's not a very good message to send kids that a person's goodness and badness are determined by some ancestor so long ago.  This is the sort of attitude that leads to perpetual war in the Balkans.<br />2.  There was one very disturbing sequence about a critical character being severely injured and ultimately dying as a result of child abuse.  This portion was really not appropriate for small children.<br />In sum, though this is an interesting, enjoyable book, I disagree it is appropriate for ages 9-12.  It would be better for teenagers.	2002-03-11

In this book, evil lies in insistence on conformity and insistence on obedience to rules.  Now, I generally have quite a bit of trouble getting my kids to do what I say to start with.

It is both complex and magical, travelling through several parallel universes in different time frames that are nevertheless mystically tied together.<br />The complexity of the story is good for developing young minds.  You can't just listen to or read this story.  You have to think about how Stanley in time frame 1 is relevant to Stanley in time frame 2 and how both are relevant to Stanley in time frame 3, as the characters echo through generations.  You have to pay attention to which time frame you are in in each chapter.  In this way, the book is reminiscent of D'Engle's book \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet\\", which also links generations in different time frames together in a mystical way, OR Nobel prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\"<br />The book also examines racial relations and the tangled web of the ancestries of all people in the melting pot that is the US, making it a uniquely American and uniquely relevant book.<br />I just can't say enough good things about this book.

In some sense it is a traditional children's story, with a fairy tale type view point, some suspense, and a happy ending.<br />The giant's language is probably the most entertaining part.  A bit reminiscent of Seuss, Dahl creates a giant who speaks something like English, but with all kinds of fractured words and expressions.<br />The giant is an inspiring character, resolved to eat the repulsant snozzcombers rather than people, which are the preferred diet of his fellows -- and who occupies himself bring dreams to people at night.<br />In some sense the ending is a bit predictable, but charming nevertheless.	2002-03-04

The child becoming a man lives in a world which is smaller than we can imagine.  It is small because he cannot see more than a few inches, but it is also small because he lives in a tiny Native American tribe that has virtually no contact with anyone outside of its own narrow circle.<br />And yet in this very small world, the adolescent begins a voyage like that of all adolescents, where adults stop being enormous mythical figures and start emerging as human beings, each with their own strengths and weaknesses; and where those adults begin to see the adolescent as one of them, with whom they can share their secrets.<br />But, unlike adolescents in our larger world, this youngster does not rebel and become angry.  Instead he grows and learns and is awed and almost overcome by what he discovers.  Perhaps this is because, in this very small world, all the adults are able to show a respect and sensitivity to the emerging man that we have lost in our larger world.<br />This book is actually very complex.  I doubt that your typical kid would understand it without help, but that is really its strength, that you can talk with your kid about what it feels like to become an adult.	2002-03-04

However, once I got into the book, I realized that since my kids are boys they weren't going to read it -- but I did and thought it was great.<br />I was familiar with the story of Helen Keller as a child and a young woman: her miraculous learning of language, her amazing graduation from Radcliffe -- but I did not know much about what went on later.<br />Despite her being an international celebrity and despite her tremendous accomplishments, Helen Keller remained very handicapped and totally dependent on others to be able to survive in the world.  She basically only earned a living by marketing herself as a curiosity.  One thing that I had never realized was that Helen Keller was unusually beautiful, with an expressive face, not at all what one might have expected from a blind, deaf person -- which is apparently part of what made her so marketable.<br />This book follows her until the very end, when she died at 87.<br />The book is an easy read, being made for children, or adolescents, and presents a very realistic point of view.  I would recommend it for younger teenage girls, or for anyone who wants a quick and painless review of Helen Keller's whole life.	2002-03-04

I almost gave up after the first chapter.  However, it was the first time I ever bought an ... Book Club book, so I stuck it out.  This turned out to be worthwhile.  Things kept getting better and the ending was really good.<br />The characters are very interesting and well-developed.<br />The book really capsulizes the old-fashioned American dream.  The real American dream was not to be fabulously wealthy, but rather to be able to work hard and get enough money to build yourself a small house to raise your family in.  Here a pregnant teenager with no family to fall back on manages to grow up and do this very thing, with a lot of help from her friends.	2002-03-04
US	49626714	RTSL3JKMJWFDK	0595189342	148573714	The Story of S.	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A great read!	The lead character is called A. M.  Presumably these initials stand for the author's name, since this is an autobiographical fantasy.  The love interest is called S. F-R (the Scion of a Famous-Rich family).<br />A. meets S. at a party.  A. stands out at the party, because she is eccentric and socially awkward, probably due to having mild Asperger's Syndrome.  Though most of the people at the party don't like her, S. is curious.  He goes to meet her and gets to know her.  He finds himself drawn to her, because he is sure that his late mother would never have approved.<br />As A. gets to know S. better, she becomes concerned about his depression.  She feels fearful that he may commit suicide, so she decides to intervene.<br />Over time, she becomes involved with his political career and his family.<br />This is a really fun novel.  It reads smoothly.  The author has a subtle, dry wit and many amusing insights into how we look at celebrities and how the press behaves.<br />It's also a bit of a naughty thrill to join the author in fantasizing about what might have been in the life of the celebrity who inspired the book.<br />Despite this being a romance, its complex psychological aspects make it entirely suitable reading for intellectuals.<br />The novel also helps the reader understand Asperger's Syndrome by looking at the syndrome through the lens of fiction.  It's much easier to read this novel than a non-fiction psychology book.	2001-12-02

It is an intellectual and spiritual challenge for both the adolescent and the adult, raising intriguing issues about the natures of: the soul, God, religious institutions, death, angels, the universe, love, sexual morality, and the nature of parenting.<br />Unfortunately, the ending of the series, found in this book, is disappointing.  By choosing one view of God and of death, the author fails to conserve the essential beauty and mystery of these things.  It would have been better to leave certain questions unanswered.<br />I am hoping that, despite this being a trilogy, there will be a fourth book.  The opening is definitely there for it.  I am also hoping that, in a later book, the author will find some way of mitigating the simplistic views of certain spiritual issues presented in The Amber Spyglass.	2001-07-15

In this book, the details are what make the reading most rewarding.  We are transported as if in a time machine to Depression era Plains, Georgia and learn things that we might otherwise never hope to know.  If we ever run out of petroleum in this country and have to start doing things by hand again, this book will be a good starting point for recreating old farming techniques.<br /> I read the book &quot;First Mothers: The Women who Shaped the Presidents&quot; immediately before reading this book.  That book had the thesis that the men who were elected president were much more strongly influenced by their mothers than their fathers.  Carter's own account of his childhood gives little support for this thesis.  The influence of his father seems much stronger, even though Carter says that he thinks that his brother was closer to his father than he was.  His mother seems fairly absent because she is off attending to her nursing career.<br /> The one frustrating thing about the book is the fairly superficial description of the black sharecroppers who Carter says also influenced him very strongly.  I particularly would have liked to have known more about the boy, A.D., who was Carter's best friend and who is only mentioned occasionally and then only in passing.  I guess this comes from the difference between the ways in which men and women write.  Men don't seem to get into these personal descriptions as much.<br /> Nevertheless, I heartily recommend this book.	2001-05-07

It's only still pictures and text, but you feel as if you're really at all those parties and ceremonies, and you get a bit more of a feeling about what the Clintons are like, though it's not that much about them.  The book lets you see firsthand how important it is for a President and his wife to be very good at social occasions and decorating.  As other viewers have remarked, the photographs are stunning.	2001-02-02

I was fascinated at how many of our recent presidents went through periods of real poverty during their childhoods.<br />You really don't get too much information about the mothers though.  It's mostly inferred from the situations and minor passing comments made by those who knew these women.  The pictures are pretty few and small, so you don't always even get a good feeling of how these women looked.<br />Also, as another reviewer remarked, it is kind of frustrating and confusing the way each chapter jumps back and forth in time.	2001-02-02
