Profoundly relieved and thankful that someone is finally saying these things. For the record, I am not a conservative. I am a feminist, and most would consider me a liberal. I have long been concerned, along with a few underground feminist sisters, about the misogyny the author names so clearly.  <br /> <br />The amazon reviewer who says the author blames feminism apparently didn't read that closely. The author praises feminism for expanding women's rights. He levels his criticisms against the \\"sex object as freedom\\" idea that took it over. I have no problem with that. Fighting the sex object role has long been one of feminism's objectives. Exposure as empowerment is a terrible theft of feminist goals and ideals. <br /> <br />As he so clearly points out (on page 5), dehumanizing a group, historically, has been a prelude to oppression of that group. He makes excellent parallels between racist dehumanization and that of women. (Example: he speculates about the audience for a show like \\"Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire,\\" one where members of an ethnic minority compete for the friendship of a man they think is wealthy.) <br /> <br />The book is a call for women in particular to speak out, and a lamentation on women's silence. <br />   <br />Certainly, since the '70s, women who protested have been accused of being against either free speech or sex; usually by the same liberals who unconditionally support the right of protest for other groups.  <br /> <br />Such accusations have so effectively smothered free and open discussion that we have today a society where hate can proceed, unchecked, to unbelievable extremes. Worse still, women themselves have taken up the banner of accusing activists of being agaist sex/freedom/whatever. The author has run into that on several occaisions. His thoughtful rebuttals were refreshing to read. <br /> <br />Perhaps it's ironic that it takes a man, a loving husband and caring father, to speak out on this issue. In this culture, sadly, it is true that a man's still word carries greater weight than a woman's.  <br /> <br />On another level, for me at least, it is what I have been wanting to see, but have despaired I ever would: a man standing up for women, against this male privilege of dehumanizing entertainment.  A man who realizes that, yes, this affects and endangers the girls and women he cares about and that yes, it is the role of the true man, and all good human beings, to stand against it.	2005-04-20

Unfortunately, Sam Harris has shown me that it is possible.  <br /> <br />His attitude toward religion and religious belief is a rigid one, dependent on a narrow, black and white view. For one thing, he confuses fundamentalism with religious or spiritual belief. He cannot separate them and, indeed, insists they can't or shouldn't be separated. As the Amazon editorial review pointed out, this is naive and immature, although perhaps it would be more honest to call it arrogance.  <br /> <br />According to Harris, if you are a REAL Christian, you can't ever really respect people of another religion (because they don't believe Jesus is the messiah.)  <br /> <br />If you are a Muslim, there is no way you can endure torture and persecution without desiring violent vegeance (quite a generalization of a billion people!). If you are a Muslim who desires vengeance after persecution, it has to do with your religion and not your human nature. <br /> <br />And by the way, REAL Judaism is about following the Old Testament laws, like those about killing disobedient children and nonbelievers. Oh, and keeping slaves. <br /> <br />In truth, I find this narrow minded, uncompromising view of religion chilling. If taken seriously, it could provide for a rollback of centuries of painstakingly aquired religious tolerance and acceptance. <br /> <br />To put it another way: you can indeed respect other religions if you are a Christian, be a non-violent Muslim, and be a religious Jew without practicing Old Testament brutality. <br /> <br />I believe Harris' view comes primarily from fear, which is understandable. Violent fundamentalists of many kinds are a danger in the world today. However, the answer is not an answering fundamentalist atheism. <br /> <br />Indeed, societies that try to forcibly elimate religious expression rarely succeed and are indeed unhappy places (see Communist Russia; see also the history of any religious minority driven underground). It is too deeply enmeshed in human culture, identity and psyche, not to mention spirituality. There is a reason America was founded on freedom of religion. <br /> <br />In short, throwing out religious respect and tolerance is indeed throwing out the baby with the bathwater. <br /> <br />	2005-02-21
US	50386604	RSOMWNBXOTXEM	0425042529	24440896	Sprig Muslin	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Refreshing	I discovered this late in my Heyer career, having read almost every Regency she had written. What a delightful discovery! I loved Amanda's incredible, outrageous inventiveness, which keeps the story moving and never lets you guess what's coming next. <br />  <br />Evidently some readers find her hard to take, but I love her ability to get herself out of almost any scrape. Very much the opposite of your demure young lady. I like Lady Hester as well, but I agree that chemistry between her and Gareth is somewhat lacking. I've always wished Heyer would have given her just a bit more \\"star quality.\\"  I feel like I've stabbed poor Hester in the back by saying that...but it's not her fault. She's written that way. <br /> <br />My major disappointment with the new edition of Sprig Muslin is the introduction. The new paperback issues (by Harlequin, I think) all have intros written by current bestselling romance writers. Some are fun to read, others a waste of time, especially if you don't know the author. To my dismay, this one was full of spoilers. The writer reveals almost every plot twist, all the way to the end. Luckily I've read the book before, but after reading the intro I felt like I didn't need to. No fun. <br /> <br />So if by some chance you've never read Sprig Muslin, do NOT read the intro unless you want to know the entire story beforehand. And in Sprig Muslin, it's the story that makes the fun. <br />	2004-11-15

I was lucky enough to grow up knowing an Arab, Muslim family, so I was able to see many of the positives of the culture that most Americans don't know. Not even Sept 11th made me paranoid of the Arab world or Islam. However, this insider's view of the world of Saudi ethnocentrism and fundamentalist Islam gave me food for thought.  <br /> <br />We Westerners don't usually take in the idea that anyone could truly find our culture, and in particular our religion, completely inferior, or if they do that it could matter. We are accustomed to seeing these attitudes in caricature on our evening news, comfortably removed.  But Carmen Bin Laden's mother in law proudly states \\"There is not a drop of Christian blood in me,\\" showing typical Saudi disdain for all foreigners and non-believers. That also sums up the attitude of Wahabist Islam.  <br /> <br />Most telling to me was reading about the way Saudi women, in particular Bin Laden women, throw themselves into religion as an outlet for all the energy and intelligence they are not otherwise allowed to express. With no rights and no freedom of movement, they are treated like pets by their husbands and fathers. The only sure road to respect and power is through religion. In Saudi culture, there is no such thing as being too strict or religious. <br /> <br />With fundamentalism sweeping the Islamic world, a country governed by these principles is a real possibility. The thought of these attitudes allied with a government and an army is not a comforting one.  <br /> <br />I docked the book 1 star because it was so short. With 14 years in Saudi Arabia, there must have been much more Ms. Bin Laden could tell. In that sense, it fares poorly in comparison to a similar book, Jean Sasson's Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia.  THAT is a book with stories I guarantee will keep you up at night. You absolutely will not forget them. <br /> <br />Still, the world needing reminding, and the perspective on the Bin Laden family is invaluable. Thank you, Carmen Bin Laden.	2004-10-04

But certainly cheated. I enjoy Austen enough that I was looking for some interesting discussion on her, discussion central to the plot and characters. Instead I found 6 characters who just weren't compelling to me. Their stories are told mostly through flashback. Unfortunate, since flashback has a quality of stopping the story dead. Most of the flashback centered around adolescent sexual experiences, which didn't help.  <br />  <br /> Only in the first chapter do they have much discussion of Austen. Perhaps other chapters were intended to have more, but the editors didn't think readers would be interested. But who would pick up a book called The Jane Austen Book Club who didn't know enough about the books to follow the discussion? <br />  <br /> The author's use of popular culture is mostly successful, though sometimes annoying. One chapter written as email exchanges I chose not to read. It's an annoying device, perhaps because email seems trivial. A poetry reading is set in a sex shop, apparently for no other reason than to mention that it's sex shop. (It's a chain store, which gives an additional aura of product placement.) <br />  <br /> One thing I must give her credit for, and that is avoiding the current trend of fashion obsessed heroines. Sex in the City appears to have convinced a generation of women that they are not adequate without shoes or clothes with a recognized name. Great for the designers. I'm not so sure about the women. <br />  <br /> In all, I would say the book is a good idea not fully realized. If she had found a way to make the stories grow out of the discussion and the group, I think it could have been a truly interesting novel.	2004-07-26

I felt she was coasting with Angels, and in Sushi for Beginners, I just didn't sympathize with the main character. <br />The Other Side of the Story had many of the things I like about Keyes: believable (for the most part) women characters with fairly realistic careers, loves & problems. Humor, but I miss the laugh-out-loud moments from Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, etc. <br />The first part of the book, Gemma's story, capitivated me. Unfortunately, my interest and sympathy for Gemma waned as the book progressed. That wasn't entirely her fault, as it's hard to have a story with two first person narrators.<br />Unlike other readers, I liked Lily and could sympathize with her worries. She was loyal enough to feel guilt at her apparent betrayal of Gemma. The story of how that came about made it clear that she acted as Gemma herself would have done if the situation had been reversed.<br />However, this made Gemma's anger and desire for revenge seem vindictive and immature, even boring. As in, he wasn't the love of your life, deal with it. I also wasn't crazy about how she treated her young boyfriend. <br />When Gemma was the narrator, I never could recapture my initial enjoyment. In general I'm not crazy about women who eighty-six good friendships over passing boyfriends, or who blame the \\"other woman\\" more than the man who actually betrayed them.<br />Jojo was more interesting than I expected, though too much of a composite. Keyes tries for everything in there: glamourous sex symbol, high powered career woman, ex-policewoman, fashion maven. I mean, come on. <br />Still, I found myself gripped by her love story, even though I wasn't crazy about how it was resolved, especially since it involved a trick or two, what I considered smoke and mirrors.<br />The insider's view of the publishing industry was interesting. I do have mixed feelings, though, about the apparent new rule in \\"chick lit\\" that you must give an insider's view of the high powered life, be it publishing, magazines or Hollywood. I enjoyed Keyes' novels most when she was writing about ordinary women. <br />What seems like fairly blatant product placement (quite insulting!), and overuse of catchphrases, like \\"not in a sexual way,\\" also got under my skin.<br />Although it undoubtedly kept me reading, it was also one of the few books where, towards the end, I skipped ahead to see how it came out. I rarely do this, no matter how much peril the main character is in, so I didn't consider it a good sign. <br />The ending was OK. It might have been nice if things had ended up a bit more evenly all around. One love story ends unhappily, and I hated that (which just shows you how Keyes can involve you, even when she isn't at her best). <br />My ultimate feeling was that this was like reading three novellas rather than a novel. All three women could have been main characters of their own novel. Here, there just wasn't enough room to develop everyone's story (and far too many supporting characters wandering around. I couldn't keep track of everyone's best friends, family background, etc.)<br />I agree with another reviewer that Keyes needs to spend some time rereading her early work. Still, what she does is better in many ways than what's out there. If you are a true fan you will probably consider this worth the investment.	2004-07-05

I expected to enjoy this one as much, but couldn't.<br />I found the indiscriminately sympathetic portrayal of Mary (known to history as Bloody Mary) troubling. The author seemed to think that because Mary was a wronged wife, her excesses were excusable. Even more disturbing, and harder to swallow, is that the main character, Hannah, a secret Jew who lives in fear of being burned as heretic, remains loyal and uncritical of Mary until the end.<br />Either Hannah is an insensitive hypocrite, indifferent to the suffering of others because of her own safety as a royal favorite, or she is a poorly drawn character. It is hard to believe someone whose own mother was burned at the stake could remain loyal to a woman who sent so many to be burned alive.<br />Gregory blames Mary's ministers, pretending Mary was largely unaware of what was being done. A ruler with Mary's absolute power \\"unaware\\"? That makes her either a disconnected, incompetent ruler (not Gregory's view), or one so weak she was completely dominated by her ministers, which there is no reason to believe.<br />Gregory did succeed in showing how sad Mary's life was in many ways: Early separation from her mother due to her father's selfish whims, loss of her position, a youth spent in a kind of exile, an unfaithful husband.<br />However, I also saw her parents' flaws in her: obsessive attachment to a indifferent man, fanaticism and sense of absolute truth which both parents possessed, and worse, a ruthlessness and cruelty in enforcing her will inherited from her father.<br />\\"Bloody Mary\\" traumatized her country and was, ironically, probably one of the reasons England turned staunchly Protestant. If you happened to catch the recent cable movie \\"Charles II, The Last King\\" you can see how strongly the hatred/fear of Catholics persisted over a century later.<br />The other strange thing about \\"The Queen's Fool\\" is the unsympathetic portrayal of Elizabeth, the ruler who would prove the most tolerant of religous practices. What is worse is that Gregory's and Hannah's condemnation of Elizabeth is largely based on qualities, actions or feelings that Hannah also exhibits.<br />For example, Hannah's (and our) first view of Elizabeth is of a 14 year old girl flirting and kissing a married man (Thomas Seymour, a notorious womanizer). Yet, for much of the novel, Hannah is in love with a married man. She even spies on and betrays a trusting mistress (Mary) for love of him. Still, Elizabeth is considered a \\"whore\\" by Hannah (a word greatly overused by Gregory, used for any sexually active woman, though there were kinder words in use at the time).<br />Hannah also condemns Elizabeth for her secret Protestantism, stange considering she herself is a secret Jew. Why does she feel such loyalty to Catholicism anyway? It is the Catholics of Spain who have particularly persecuted her people, and Mary's husband is the Spanish King.

US	50386604	RL6UG8Q3655F6	0743227441	512398584	The Other Boleyn Girl	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good read	For the most part, this was a gripping story that revived my interest in the Tudor period, the kind of story with a &quot;you were there&quot; feel. <br />However, I gave it four stars instead of five. One reason was that, for all its compelling qualities, it did lack a little in the drama department. When the final tragedy sweeps over George and Anne, witnessed by Mary, I wasn't as engaged as I thought I would be. This may be an inbuilt problem with making a minor character the center of the story. Anne's trial, imprisonment and execution are experienced by Mary only at second hand, or from a distance. I wanted more.<br />The second reason (SPOILER alert) has to do with the author's choice to take seriously the accusation of incest between Anne and her brother. Her reason for doing so--that in Anne's desperation for a son, she took a lover, and George would have been the &quot;obvious choice&quot;--seemed far-fetched.  It's difficult to imagine any situation where one's brother would seem the &quot;obvious&quot; choice to father your child, no matter how desperate you were. <br />That Anne might take a lover I could believe, and that she would trust George as her go between, absolutely; but that a woman raised in such a highly religious culture, and surrounded by admirers, would turn to her brother? It makes no sense, except as a sensational plot device.<br />The fact that before his execution, George confessed to homosexuality but not incest, supports this. It is as if he were saying, &quot;This was what I really did.&quot;<br />Henry had a string of stillborn children with Katherine.   Ironically, another stillbirth is probably the best proof that Henry was the father. (If Anne had taken a lover, or even produced a healthy boy with Henry, it's interesting to think how different history would have been.)<br />The accusations, along with witchcraft and multiple adulteries, seemed obviously design to blacken Anne's name, so that Henry would be justified not merely in divorce but execution. <br />Henry had followed a similar with Katherine, convincing himself the marriage was invalid and, crucially, it was really Katherine's fault. <br />Probably it was also meant to salve his conscience. Having gone to such great lengths to put Anne, a commoner, on the throne, only a very good reason would seem to justify setting her aside. <br />Mere adultery apparently wasn't enough. But an incestuous witch who trafficked with the Devil? Who could blame Henry then? I think it shows the depth of his hatred, and perhaps fear, of her.  Certainly, there was more than a touch of cruelty in persuading Anne to sign annullment papers (making her only child illegitimate, with no right to the throne) in the belief that she would be spared, only to take her life anyway.<br />In any case, Gregory's unorthodox interpretation made it difficult for me to connect with the story after a certain point. Not difficult enough, however, to dock the book more than one star.	2004-02-16
US	50386604	RRNBDXP8Y3MGU	0679428895	451458080	Pompeii: A Novel	Books	3	24	32	N	N	Disappointed	This book is excellent when it comes to the science of the eruption and aqueduct; not so great when it comes to people. As another reviewer mentioned, the characters are two dimensional. The villains are all-evil, (and of course get their comeuppance in suitable fashion). The hero is interesting but a little anachronistic for my taste (in his complete rejection of the religious beliefs of his time; his rejection of philosophers rings more true.)<br />What bothered me most was the unnecessary wallowing in grotesque and ugly imagery, not to do with the eruption, but with the lifestyles of the rich and powerful. It didn't add much depth or insight, and was simply unpleasant to read. It made me nostalgic for old historical epics like Quo Vadis, the Robe, Ben Hur. These writers/directors knew how to make villains without wallowing in ugly details. They also knew how to add depth to their characters. Quo Vadis in particular is a masterpiece.<br />Unlike another reader, I didn't find Exomnious' fate anticlimactic, but actually one of the more interesting moments of the novel. I did, however, have a little trouble with the hero going back to Pompeii during the eruption to rescue his girlfriend, not to mention a few questions about how he did it. Could they have survived, or would the water have been boiling?<br />The final image of the book is impressive, but unsatisfying from the &quot;what happened next&quot; point of view. The story ends abruptly, with the eruption. It could have used an afterword.<br />Bottom line: if you are a fan of this writer, or possibly of Pompeii, you will want this. For fans of historical fiction, I'd say, don't rush out to buy it.	2003-12-01

For many years, I only read the romance, but gradually phased in more of the history. Generally I love historical fiction. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Heyer was such a meticulous historian that she had had trouble blending it with fiction. Parts of the book can be quite dry unless you are a Waterloo historian.<br />I have mixed feelings about the romance. I agree with the other reviewer that it's hard to see Charles and Barbara living happily ever after. They are both vital, interesting people but so different in type. Partly, this is because their basis for falling in love is never well established. They meet at a ball, and suddenly the capricious Barbara and the seasoned Charles have found true love? They have little in common; no meeting of minds or common values to build on. It's hard to agonize over their love affair. I join Charles' friends in believing he'd be happier with Lucy. <br />In the real world of the Regency, they'd probably have had an affair instead. Barbara being a widow would have made it acceptable, if they were discreet. But in Heyer's 1930's world it was not possible to explore that in romantic fiction.<br />This brings me to a few plot points that always bother me. There is the quarrel that separates them, involving Harriet and Perry. Charles says he'd already asked Barbara to sheath her sword where Harriet was concerned. True, but he ignores the additional provocation Barbara was given. It seems he wants to marry a spoiled, strong willed, hot tempered woman, but expects her to change completely the moment they become engaged. How realistic is that? It always makes Charles seem slightly priggish, in that final quarrel, and I feel that Barbara gets more blame than she deserves.<br />The other thing I dislike is the attitude of Judith and Barbara towards Lucy once her secret is revealed. They are both so superior and contemptuous, though Barbara has done things far more scandalous.<br />Good points of the book include following the further story of the Alastairs and the Worths, both improved from their original stories. I particularly enjoy the Duke and Duchess of Avon. It is this, plus the vividness of the characters and story, that makes it re-readable, even if you have to suspend disbelief over the romance.	2003-10-04

In &quot;recreating&quot; her, Flook inserts so much of herself. At least, when the writer imagines the thoughts and feelings of a stranger, unless she has had access to private diaries or letters, it's safe to say there's a good deal of the author in those writings. <br />That was my primary problem with this story. It reads like fiction, and as fiction it would be acceptable. However, whenever I remembered that this was a real woman whose private thoughts or experiences were being &quot;created&quot; (that is, made up), there was always a shock of distaste. Inappropriate, even disrespectful, although I don't believe Flook intended it that way.<br />She makes no secret of her identification with the victim: both single mothers, writers, socially prominent in New England, and both with unhappy childhoods. Fair enough, but there's overidentification here. As a writer, she literally plays the role of Christa. Apparently, in her autobiographical &quot;My Sister Life,&quot; Flook did this with an admired older sister. <br />The story would have been much better served with a traditional investigative format, with professional distance on the author's part. It could still have explored her identification with Christa, since there's nothing so strange in that. Most women, especially mothers, can identify with some aspect of her story.<br />I'm sure one reason the publishers agreed to this format is because there just isn't enough material here. With no witnesses, no physical evidence linking any suspect to the crime scene, no clear cut suspects, and little apparent future for the case, there just isn't much to write about. <br />To pad things out, Flook includes an exhaustive biography of Christa that actually gets boring. She lived through some exciting times, but Christa didn't do enough to make her life story interesting to an outsider, other than the unusual story around her child's birth. Even that would be less interesting, I suspect, if it weren'tfor the gruesome circumstances of the murder, or the simple fact that Ava is a pretty child.<br />Other padding includes accounts of unsolved murders that have nothing to do with the case, local history and characters, and more than you really want to know about Provincetown and Truro.<br />As other reviewers mentioned, there is an annoying amount of repetition (once on the same page!), and some pretentious use of vocabulary. &quot;Affectless&quot; used several times for &quot;emotionless,&quot; for example. <br />I gave it three stars, though, because for whatever reason it kept me reading. It may be the drama of the story itself, which has the quality of a ghost story. It may also be Flook's talents as a fiction writer (except this isn't fiction).<br />Whatever the reason, it left me with the sense that this case isn't likely to be solved soon, if ever, and for all Christa's family and friends, and for Christa herself, I'm sorry.	2003-09-02

Mostly I enjoyed it, but a plot twist in the ending spoiled it. Rowling delights in performing last minute switches: good characters who are really evil, or vice versa. In this case, the character at Hogwarts who was revealed to be evil didn't work. There was no foreshadowing, no clues. It felt like a bait and switch. As if she picked the name out of a hat. This teacher seems to be basically good, and suddenly it's revealed that all year long he has actually been a psychopath? I don't think so.<br />By the same token, I found the graveyard confrontation with Voldemort to be just too grim and ugly. It's possible, I believe, to write about evil and confrontations without reveling in the grotesque aspects. That's not a fashionable view, I know, but it's how I felt reading it.<br />The other criticism I had is small but fair, I think: Hermione's sudden transformation into a beautiful girl for the ball. Don't get me wrong: I'm glad Hermione had a boyfriend, but I would have preferred if she had turned out as simply ordinarily pretty for the ball, something within the reach of the majority of her young girl readers. Most girls aren't going to turn stunningly beautiful with a little hair gel!<br />Otherwise the book was an engaging read, though I think my favorite so far was number 2: enough danger, still the wonder, no unbelievable plot twists.	2003-08-06

It has all of Keyes' strong points, and it drew me in from the first page. <br />My problems came with the crisis between Ashling and Clodagh. Like many before her, Clodagh has found that life as a full time mom, isolated in the suburbs, with no career outside child raising, isn't what it's cracked up to be. Keyes draws a sympathetic portrait of Clodagh's alienation, her undramatic slide towards depression. <br />Clodagh's solution to her problem isn't the most noble, but it's human, and hardly uncommon. (Anyone believe her handsome, always busy husband was completely faithful to her? Even getting it just once a month?)<br />From then on, the novel's sympathies are split. Switching gears from her sympathetic portrait, Keyes seems to enjoy heaping disasters on Clodagh. And the depths of Ashling's crisis over it seems a little manufactured. This is a guy she has dated only a few months. She wasn't in love. If it had been her husband or serious lover, maybe I could see it, and the issue of Clodagh's selfishness.<br />There isn't even a scene where we see it through Clodagh's eyes. To her, Ashling has everything: glamourous job, freedom, semi-famous boyfriend, but doesn't seem to appreciate it.<br />The one-sidedness of the whole thing made me uncomfortable, and in my opinion, damaged the story.<br />By the end, I was so concerned about when Keyes (and Ashling) were going to let up on Clodagh that I lost interest in the central romance. Too bad, because I'd been following it with interest up until then. Jack does sound Divine;)<br />And unlike Ashling, I wouldn't abandon a lifetime friendship over a boyfriend who would have two timed me anyway.<br />Apart from that, it is very readable Keyes' fare. As usual, she touches well on serious themes. Lisa, the mag hag, makes an entertaining read--even if we'd never, never want her as a boss, friend or even co-worker. The behind the scenes glimpse of the magazine world is interesting. All inall, the book makes acceptable light reading, especially for Keyes fans.	2003-06-10

They scared me more than the average whodunnit, and alerted me to security issues I'd never considered before.<br />Weaknesses include some of those noted by another reviewer, about character development and background. Also, Bast seems curiously friendless: doesn't she have a best friend or even a sister to confide in?<br />My biggest problem was the huge number of extra characters who drop by, share a bit of exposition, then disappear. This got boring, especially since the action didn't start until halfway through the book. This is a short, simple novel that can't handle so many characters.<br />I wish Edghill had provided more background on Mary, QOS. Like Bast, I got most of my knowledge from old movies. Unlike Bast, I can't take time off to read a biography. This made many things, like conflicts between coveners, difficult to follow.<br />One book store owner, important to the story, says that all Mary wanted were her rights. Does she mean the throne of Scotland? England? France? I couldn't tell.<br />Edghill did have some good insights about Mary, in particular the effect on her of being essentially exiled from France.<br />Edghill obviously enjoys showing the diversity of her community, and she doesn't mind admitting there are warts. However, some of those warts showed when the author used the term &quot;politically correct&quot; to dismiss some other faction of pagans. <br />I'm never impressed when people use that term to diss people on their side of the fence. It's an invalidation, a dismissal both of people and their feelings as being worthy.  Invalidation is rarely the best way to resolve conflict, especially in an already conflicted community.<br />This novel and the series it belongs to will appeal most to readers who are of the pagan community, or are curious about it.	2003-03-14

Her ability to write vivid characters, and her sense of fun, earn this one an extra star.<br />I haven't checked, but I'm sure this must be one of her earlier Regencies. You can see her experimenting with characters who become archetypes, like the gamester brother, or the perfect gentleman friend who supports the heroine in her trials.<br />She includes some details that don't appear in later novels, hinting at the darker side of Regency society.<br />My biggest problem is the hero, Lord Cardross. Her heroes often have a harsh streak, but he comes across as too harsh and cold, without the humor that usually softens her heroes. He and Nell are at outs for most of the story, which doesn't help.<br />He's a man in his thirties, while Nell is barely nineteen, and that makes them an uneven match. And he has an unkind and ungracious habit of baiting Nell for marrying him for his money. Since she came from a noble but bankrupt family, the rules of their world dictated she didn't have a choice. He knows that as well as she does. It's unpleasant to watch him holding it over her head.<br />Since Cardross isn't the most sympathetic hero, it's hard to identify with Nell's love for him. She can seem like a bit of a twit. That's especially true since she's got a debt she won't tell her husband about, and all kinds of silly, frustrating scruples about how to get the money to pay it back. She's not all bad, but she reminds me of the kind of female Heyer satirized in later books.<br />Also strange is that we are asked to believe they both fell in love at first site, and that neither one of them has even suspected it, even though the marriage has been consummated for several months. Possible, I suppose, but not pleasant to think about.<br />What saves this story for me is the tempestuous Letty, Cardross' half sister and ward. She's more of a risk taker than Heyer's later young ladies. Of course she is head over heels in love with an unsuitable young man. Letty's attempts to get her own way and marry him before he sails abroad are very entertaining. The lover himself is certainly not what you'd expect.<br />In short, this is not Heyer at the top of her form. For the true fan it is worth collecting, and certainly worth re-reading, but not as often as her best.love with an unsuitable young man.

It's a star-crossed love story, with class and social position being the obstacles. John is a young nobleman with a strict guardian; Tamsin the illegitimate daughter of a disreputable landowner. Their romance, of course, must be pursued secretly.<br />In the 16th century there were harsh penalties for sex outside of marriage, penalties mostly suffered by women. Her mother's fate is something Tamsin is determined to avoid. John, however, is a spoiled young man used to having his own way, especially with women. Clashes are inevitable, but thru Tamsin, John learns to be less selfish.<br />There is plenty of historical color, though it is all local: no pageantry of courts or large cities here, but long forgotten marriage and May Day customs.<br />The title Sweet Nightingale refers to a 16th century love ballad, a song which serves as a prism through which the lovers view their affair. As the affair changes, the song takes on different meanings. And there is a beautiful love scene which surpasses most of the more explicit ones I've read.<br />The implosion comes when circumstances conspire to create a misunderstanding. Unfortunately, John reverts to form as a spoiled nobleman.<br />His treatment of Tamsin is so cold and harsh, so entirely unsympathetic, that it broke the spell for me. Worse still, he blames everyone but himself for his problems. It all made me queasy, so I wouldn't recommend the story on romantic grounds. However, if you are interested in Elizabethan times, you'll find a well-researched historical by a writer who can carry off a suspenseful plot.	2003-01-20

I was deeply impressed by his gifts with language, the ability to convey ideas in ways anyone can understand, and to inspire. Any writer could learn by studying his work.<br />If you are interested in human rights questions, I recommend  reading this piece by piece, though it is a large volume. So much of what King said isn't limited to the movements of 50 years ago, but to the ongoing struggle for human dignity and equality.	2003-01-20

I can take them because they are both decent people at heart, in spite of their faults. And their clashes of temper can be fun to watch! The one thing I find really unacceptable is the scene where Serena berates Emily. If you've read the book, you know the scene I mean. (Rotherham also berates Gerard, but he has a purpose. Serena means it.)<br />I also like the romance that blossoms between Fanny and the man she least expects. <br />Heyer makes one of her favorite points with both couples, one that is probably snobbish but has some truth to it, about the importance of similar \\"background\\" (class).<br />Serena and Rotherham were both born to the ruling class. Through the story the reader sees that Serena will never be happy outside that world. It's too much a part of who she is.<br />Hector, Serena's old flame, was born to the more modest rank of \\"landed gentry\\" and doesn't want her life. Neither does Fanny, Serena's friend. The life Hector can give her is exactly the kind that makes her happy. <br />In Heyer's eyes, it is this clash of background and values that makes Hector and Serena wrong for each other. It is the similarity of background/ values that makes both couples right for each other. <br />The study of Regency manners here is rewarding if you pay attention.<br />Serena and her Aunt Teresa are a portrait of aristocratic ladies: how they spoke, thought, and gossiped, and what they gossiped about. Fanny, Hector and his mother show the manners and values of the landed middle class, Jane Austen's level of society. Mrs. Floore and Ned Goring represent the up-and-coming merchant class (though Mrs. Floore is really more caricature.)<br />One problem is that GH makes many elliptical references to political events of the time. Her original readers probably knew what she meant. For the modern reader it's frustrating--she tells just enough to make you curious. It needs footnotes.<br />The story is well written and plotted. Though it is complicated, everything is kept tangled until the end. Not as easy to do as it seems.  It's worth reading for the portrait of Regency life, and several vivid characters, even if you don't like Serena and Rotherham.	2002-12-24

I gave it a try because the \\"haunted New Orleans\\" aspect sounded fascinating.  Here are some reasons I'm sorry I picked it up:<br />1. Rape scene: The story begins with a rape scene. I don't want rape scenes in romance novels, even when they aren't committed by the hero. With romance like this, who needs real life??<br />2. Language. Bad language doesn't phase me, but I'm not looking for it in a romance novel. <br />3. Strip club. The hero and his buddy spend an evening hitting the strip clubs. Major turn off. Give me a man who is too mature, and has too much integrity, to treat women like sex toys. (Yes, there are plenty of men like that.) And give me a woman with too much backbone to take it. <br />I won't even get into the \\"Prince Charming marries the maid\\" aspect of the 1900 romance. <br />On the plus side, there is a brave attempt at gender bending in the reincarnation aspect. However, for me it interfered with the romantic mood. <br />It's back to British Chick Lit for me.	2002-12-22

Reading the book jacket, the characters sound like slightly annoying caricatures, but Keyes fleshes them out so they become real. I especially like the way Tara and Katherine's friendship grows, so that by the end they are real friends, guarding the other's weak spots, and knowing each other's worst secrets.<br />Fintan's character is not quite as well developed. However, Keyes deals realistically with the issues of serious illness and facing death. She doesn't dwell on the ugly parts, but she doesn't gloss them over, either. These chapters may be upsetting for someone dealing with a bereavement, especially if they are expecting simple escape reading.<br />There's a good man in here, of course. Actually more than one, but only one who is a main character. Naturally it's great fun to watch the romance develop, although there are (of course!) a few painful bumps along the way.<br />There's also a bad man, Lorcan, a name similar enough to Fintan that it made the first several chapters confusing. Lorcan is basically a sexual sociopath. You'll think twice about ever taking a sexy, charming, humble-and-adoring seeming man at face value.<br />Keyes raises the issue of ending an unwanted, unintended pregnancy. I wish she hadn't, mostly because she drew me in to the woman's situation, then copped out by the way she resolved it. All I could think of were all the women whose dilemmas don't get conveniently resolved that way.<br />Anyway, I laughed at least once a chapter and cared about the characters. If you are a fan of Keyes, you'll probably enjoy it, too.	2002-12-20

India and the era of the Sepoy Mutiny have always interested me, and this book covers it throughly, without romanticizing. It also delivers a believable love story between two intelligent, independent minded characters.<br />Laura, the philosophical poor relation, owes a certain debt to Jane Eyre, but she is far from being a carbon copy. Travelling to India with her newly married cousin, she wants to know something of the real, non-British India. Along the way she makes some unusual friends, from a scholarly merchant to an Indian noble, not to mention the women who have managed to survive life in India. <br />Oliver owes a debt to Georgette Heyer's harsh featured, anti-social heroes, but again is developed so well that he is a character in his own right. Though English, he is a zemindar, a kind of hereditary Indian noble. He sees all too clearly the mistakes and injustices of the British that lead to the rebellion. He has a few flaws of his own, though, including a tendency to blame women for the tensions between the British and Indians.<br />Like a Victorian novel, it moves slowly, introducing all the characters and situations that will be important in the last half of the story. However, enough happens to keep these chapters interesting.<br />Eventually, Laura, Oliver and their friends find themselves engulfed in one of the bloodiest rebellions of the 19th century. Even today, reading about the war crimes committed by both sides is enough to make you shudder, though this is not one of those novels that revels in descriptions of bloody or violent scenes. It has much more to do with how experience changes the characters. After I read it, I feel almost envious of Laura, whose hardships have brought her so much insight and perspective. <br />Like other posters here, I always wish for a sequel, or even a different book by the same author. It is much better than, for example, the highly romanticized Shadow of the Moon by MM Kaye, which also covers the Rebellion.	2002-12-18

It doesn't stand up well to my other favorite about the Indian Mutiny, Zemindar. That is history for grownups. This is romance novel fantasy. However, if exotic escapism is what you are after, this does provide.<br />The plot is full of incredible romantic conceits, from Winter, the European heroine, having a background that will allow her to pass flawlessly as Indian (convenient during a mutiny); Winter's parents, beautiful, highborn, perfect lovers who die young, leaving her with a Spanish title and lots of money; the series of coincidences that lead to her voluntarily marrying a real \\"rotter\\" (although given the total innocence in which Victorial girls were kept, not totally unbelievable). <br />Then there is Alex, superior to Winter's husband in every way. He has a way of being present at historic moments, or running across historic figures, and like Winter can blend at will into the Indian landscape. He is the perfect English soldier-gentleman. His conflict over protecting Winter vs the greater good, though, is a believable one with which the reader can sympthize.<br />My worst criticism of the love story is that, even though Winter is pregnant before it's all over, there are no good love scenes. From a strictly romantic POV, that leaves the story lacking.<br />For the rest, there are the usual stock characters: Young Englishwoman, Innocent Victim; Loose Woman with a Heart of Gold; Native Mistress with a Heart of Stone; Villain Motivated By Lust, etc. To give her credit, they are real enough while you are reading. It's good, historical-romance escapism for the right mood.	2002-12-18

Then you need this book.<br />For me the most shocking thing about Living Downstream is how little known it is, given the life or death issues it addresses. I had never heard of it until I attended a lecture in support of the author's new book, Having Faith: An Ecologist's Journey to Motherhood.<br />What Living Downstream does is explore the connections between the toxic chemicals found everywhere in our environment, and various cancers and other diseases.<br />Examined are various mediums of transmission: earth, air, water, fire; chemicals from vinyl chloride, to pesticides and insecticides, to PCBs--even dry cleaning fluid (PCE); and scientific evidence of their connections to cancers, immune deficiencies and reproductive problems.<br />Pulling all this research together is in itself a tremendous service. Science so often involves narrow fields of research with little communication between fields.<br />Still, though it's hardly a \\"light read,\\" it is nothing like those dry science textbooks you remember. <br />The author is also a poet, and she uses metaphor and imagery to explain in easy terms anything unfamiliar to the non-scientist. This makes the book intelligent-user friendly and even, at times, beautiful. The personal narrative keeps it human.<br />However, I won't lie and say it is a \\"fun read.\\" The truth is, I found it educational and even life-changing, but also deeply unsettling and even frightening. <br />No longer can I dismiss cancer as genetic, or easily warded off through diet and lifestyle, or see environmental cancers as the problem of those poor souls unfortunate enough to live near some toxic waste dump.<br />The book gave me knowledge, and yes, it's true: knowledge IS power. It gave me the motivation to buy organic, to use filtered (NOT bottled) water, to take a very serious look at any chemical I use around my home. <br />It also helped me understand why this is not the whole answer, that the real answer lies in taking serious steps to addressthe poisoning of our environment. The first and most important step, however, is awareness, which is why you should read this book.	2002-12-09

I loved the glimpse into a more elegant world. Over the years I have read it more times than I can count.<br />The plot and characters are well-described here, so I won't repeat that. They are as familiar as old friends.(I always feel a bit sorry for poor Maria, who means so well--but I'm not sure I'd want to live with her!) Annis can sometimes come across as hard, Mr. Carleton as overbearing, but the relationship between them I love: the shared sense of humor, the quick understanding. This is what a meeting of kindred spirits might actually be like--if it's not \\"mawkish\\" to say so;) Certainly I can picture them being happy together.<br />Fairly recently, I discovered Black Sheep, which parallels Lady of Quality in several ways: The older, self assured heroine who has no need to marry; the slightly disreputable hero; the younger girl; the old maid companion; the staid, disapproving brother. It's by no means a carbon copy of Lady of Quality, though the similarities are strong, but I tend to prefer this one.<br />One thing I have a problem with is Mr. Carleton's reputation as a womanizer, which is treated as an attractive feature by the author, if not by Annis' relations.<br />This doesn't quite wash with me. Not because I expect a man of his age to be celibate. It's the idea of buying women of the poorer class for use as \\"convenients\\" that bothers me. Remember, these are women he'd never introduce to women of his \\"own\\" class, let alone marry.<br />I mention it because it recurs again and again in Heyer novels, with the heroine always accepting it cheerfully. Granted, for women of Heyer's (or Annis') generation, being open-minded about this was their version of sexual liberation. I personally, however, would prefer a hero who has his affairs with women he considers equals.	2002-12-09

It kind of deserved the title \\"chick lit\\" or \\"beach reading.\\" It dealt with some serious situations, but it was basically fantasy. That's OK, I like escape reading.<br />Rachel's Holiday, however, had what Watermelon was missing: the bite of real life. The plot is summarized many times here, so I won't bother to repeat it. What I liked was Ms Keyes' ability to write a book about something serious, addiction, without losing her sense of humor, romance or fun. <br />\\"Lost Weekend\\" treatments of addiction are a dime a dozen. The ability to write about serious material without sacrificing what makes pleasure reading fun is far more rare. <br />I'll never forget the story of mild-mannered Neil, for example, who just likes \\"a few with the guys on Saturday night.\\" But then Keyes is so often hilarious that I laughed out loud every other page. <br />Helen, Rachel's nemesis of a sister, is always good for a funny scene. And then of course there is the romance with Luke, plus the sexy guy Rachel stumbles across in rehab....I even dreamed I was in the Cloisters, making friends with the brown sweaters and arguing with Sister Josephine.<br />I hope Rachel will play a role in the other sisters' stories. I liked her character and I'd love to see her story continue to unfold.<br />This was definitely a stay up all night read, so be sure to wait for a long weekend or holiday before starting this one.

My biggest problem with this story is the hero. When Sarah demands to be released from their engagement, he refuses. It's not out of any love for Sarah, merely a desire to have his own way. This made me lose respect for him. Sarah, after a bit of protest, accepts the situation. This was not believable, and it certainly was not romantic. Even though he unbends a bit as they begin to fall in love, showing a somewhat nicer side, he still comes across as too controlling.	2002-11-13

One day, her uncle comes and carries her off to London, promising her a better life. Unknown to Katharine, her uncle has a hidden motive.<br />In London, she attracts several admirers, including two brothers: one a gamester who works at her uncle's gaming house; the other an ex-soldier, nicer than his brother but still something of an adventurer. She also meets Judith, an old friend, now married. <br />As she slowly realizes there is a price for her new life, she also finds it's one she can't bring herself to pay. Unfortunately, her uncle has no intention of letting her off the hook: He has debts, and intends Katharine for the first wealthy man who will pay them. <br />Katharine is a bit exasperating, because she can't seem to grasp that every time she rejects one scheme, her uncle resorts to the next option, which is always worse. She is honest to a fault, and inevitably paints herself into a corner, where the only option is to fall in with the gambler brother's plan to trick an elderly lady.<br />And what of the hero, the ex-soldier? He eventually comes to her rescue, of course, but shows an equally exasperating tendency to keep &quot;testing&quot; her honesty. This seems a bit overbearing, since he has good reason to know she is simply in over her head--and it's partly due to him that Katharine feels she has no option but to run off with his brother. <br />This story has a nice feel for Regency London, though the plot is more dramatic than lighthearted. Katharine's uncle, cold and calculating, makes a believable villain. Her friend, Judith, is a fun character. I wish she'd had more of a role in the story. As for the couple, they are opposites in many ways, but you hope they'll be happy.	2002-11-11

Mixed feelings have always been my response to this Sylvia Thorpe romance. <br />Antonia and Geraint are forced to marry by her wealthy grandfather. She is a spirited woman longing for freedom but kept a prisoner by her tyrannical grandfather. Geraint is charming and a bit of a rogue. There is a domineering edge to his personality, but sense of humor and a certain integrity keep him from being a bully.<br />In spite of their unfortunate beginning, they fall in love, only to find themselves menaced by unforeseen danger. Rather, Geraint is menaced by danger, and accuses Antonia of betrayal.<br />This is where my mixed feelings come in. Though he says he loves her, he seems to WANT to believe Antonia is guilty. Starved of love all her life, Antonia finds herself tossed aside like a toy that no longer pleases. <br />His deep prejudice blinds him to signs that his judgment is at fault, and clues to the real solution. It also plays right into the hands of his real enemy.<br />Geraint's saving grace as a hero is that through all this he still loves Antonia. His suspicions are irrational, but he genuinely believes them.<br />I'd have liked him better, though, if he'd been willing to notice that Antonia's behavior and character are very much at odds with his suspicions. The saying \\"love is blind\\" doesn't usually mean being blind to someone's good qualities! As it is, there are scenes I simply can't read without thinking: \\"He deserves to lose her.\\" <br />Eventually, the truth is revealed. However, Geraint's lack of real pain or remorse at having treated the woman he loves so badly always strikes me as odd. He's far more concerned with getting proof beyond all doubt of her innocence, and sets the bar outrageously high.<br />The story moves quickly but doesn't feel sketchy. The villain's methods are clever and surprisingly believable. The main characters' friends and romantic rivals are also vivid. I liked Lucy particularly, and felt she could have resolved the situation in short order.<br />If you want an interesting study in double standards, read the author's Three Loves or Tarrington Chase. In those, the hero is also suspected of a terrible deed. The heroine, of course, believes in him without question and without proof. Quite a contrast.	2002-11-02

The people are as wise, noble and spiritual as we'd like to believe the ancients were. <br />The novel is as much philosophy as story, and there is much to provoke thought. However, the book can be enjoyed whether you take it as past life memory or just an escape to another time.<br />Sekeeta is a princess born to a First Dynasty pharaoh. When the young girl shows a talent for clairvoyant dreams, she is sent to train as a Priestess of Anubis, the god of prophecy. Her temple teachers are wise, and train her to use her gifts to serve her country. When she is grown, she rules as co-Pharaoh with her brother Neyah.<br />As noted above, this book is philosophy in novel form. It is to our conventional idea of the novel as the Egyptian wall painting is our idea of painting. The traditional elements of conflict, action and strong character development aren't much in evidence here. That doesn't make it unreadable, just different. <br />The language is stylized but beautiful, with a certain biblical flavor, the imagery vivid and poetic. In the childhood part of Sekeeta's life, she is told child's stories with simple, sound lessons, like The Monkey Who Wanted to be a Man.<br />Also interesting are the meanings behind some hieroglyphic symbols; in Grant's view, the images were metaphors for spiritual concepts or lessons. The word &quot;beloved,&quot; for example, was written as a plow to show that, as a plow makes the earth fertile, so love does likewise to the heart. <br />On the whole, this a book that I return to and enjoy.	2002-10-20

(Darkover)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Cautionary Tale	\\"Man is the only animal that thinks not to improve his race...Should we not seek to better ourselves as well our world and our surroundings?\\" <br />This is a quote from Stormqueen, but it won't be long before someone raises this question in the real world, or before we have the scientific capacity to create such a future. Marian Zimmer Bradley's prescient tale, written in the '70's, explores the very real consequences, the temptations and dangers, of such genetic manipulation.<br />For those not familiar with Darkover, think of it as the Middle Ages with psychic powers. It is warlike, patriarchal and pre-industrial. The lack of machines is made up for by crystals, or matrixes, which greatly amplify naturally occuring psychic powers, or laran. These have been developed to take the place of mechanical technology, for both peaceful or warlike means. (There is a striking and again, prescient, parallel between the \\"relay screens\\" and the internet.)<br />Like any talent, skills vary from person to person. These psychic gifts being the very foundation of Darkover civilization, people have been bred over generations for specific gifts, much like an animal breeding program. For the resulting children, death is common, as is mental/emotional instability.<br />All of the characters in Stormqueen have lives maimed by the breeding program. Mikhail of Aldaran has seen all of his children die; Allart has been cursed with a gift that shows him all possible consequences of each act; Renata has worked desperately to have a life beyond a childbearing pawn; Donal is forced into an intolerable situation due to his stepfather's desire for an heir. <br />And of course there is Dorilys, the young Stormqueen, a child with a gift far beyond her ability to handle it.  A lesser writer would have made Dorilys a one-dimensional spoiled brat or \\"witch girl.\\" The typical male SF writer would probably have turned her into an evil sex nymph. (See lurid cover art, which is the original from the '70's.) <br />In Bradley's hands, Dorilys is a fully human young girl, sometimes arrogant and spoiled, but also courageous and loving. These two aspects of her character pull her either way; until the end, it's never certain which will prevail.<br />The story does have its rough spots and slow places. I could have done with a little less about Allart and Cassandra's marriage, for example. You won't miss much if you skim those chapters. Since it was in there, I would have preferred a little more about how Cassandra grows from a highly dependent, girlish character into a tried and true woman.<br />As another reviewer noted, this is a tragedy in the classic Greek sense. At each turning or crossroads, there seems only one option, yet inevitably it leads to a tragic conclusion. The flaws of more than one character bring about the tragedy, but still it's hard to see how it could have been avoided.<br />This book is powerful sci-fi/fantasy with underlying serious issues. If you are concerned about some of the questions the world is facing, Stormqueen will speak to you.<br />I also recommend MZB's other early Darkover novels: Hawkmistress, Heritage of Hastur, Thendara House, even The Forbidden Tower (though it's not a favorite). They all feature intelligent characters dealing with complex ethical or emotional questions, with plenty of action thrown in.	2002-10-17
US	50386604	RSFVJM3SL3HVK	0373834470	825722191	Talisman Ring	Books	5	4	5	N	N	One of my favorites	I won't recap the plot for you, since several reviewers have already done so. Suffice it say that everything they write about romantic Eustacie (whose primary requirement in a husband is that he ride \\"ventre a terre\\" to her deathbed); sardonic, inexcusably sensible Sir Tristam; romantic Ludovic; witty Sarah Thane and the host of supporting characters in this light, lovely farce is true. <br />In some ways, I like this better than some of her Regencies, which eventually became formulaic, or at least stylized. In those, characters who desire adventure or romance are sometimes mocked. By contrast, The Talisman Ring perfectly balances sympathy for Eugenie with a tongue in cheek treatment of the adventure itself.<br />My only criticism is the villain. I never feel that villains were Ms. Heyer's strong suit. I'm not sure why. Part of it may be her desire to make them ordinary; the other part may be her preference for associating effeminacy in men with villainy.<br />That's a minor quibble, however, in a highly enjoyable tale.	2002-10-16

Daryl Conyngton is a devoted Royalist. Charity Shenfield, an orphan and his neighbor, has grown up with Daryl. She comes from a neutral household, but her cousin Jonas grows more and more devoted to the Puritan cause. Charity goes to work for and live with Daryl's family and also devotes herself to the Royalist cause.<br />Set against a background of war, oppression, friendship and love, this is a readable story. Daryl and Charity are both strong characters. Jonas becomes steadily more dangerous, the enemy of both. <br />My only complaint is that the story is fairly short. A novel set in this era deserves and could stand up to the epic treatment. It's to the author's credit, though, that even though this story is simply told, it still manages enough depth to keep it engaging. Spring Will Come Again is the sequel.	2002-10-14

Rowland is a Royalist who needs to escape from Puritan authorities. Her guardian has forbidden her to marry him, but she is determined to do so any way. <br />Tom, of course, is in on the secret, but the more he sees of Rowland, the less he thinks Roxanne should marry him. To be fair, Rowland isn't much of a catch; if she marries him Roxanne will probably have a hard life. Tom, however, makes the fatal mistake of making his opposition clear to Roxanne. This naturally makes her determined to have her own way. The resulting conflict takes them from Jamaica to a pirate stronghold, and back again to England. <br />Tom is a likeable hero, even if you can't help wishing someone would give him Georgette Heyer's common sense advice: &quot;Few things are as invigorating to high-spirited adolescents as opposition.&quot; (GH, The Black Sheep). <br />The only thing I don't care for is how he treats her after a climactic argument they have. Feeling powerless, Roxanne strikes out with words. Afterwords, Tom treats her coldly, more like a prisoner than a woman he is angry with but still loves. That bothered me. On the whole, however, I find Sylvia Thorpe to be better than most of what's out there today.	2002-10-14
US	50386604	R3T0CA8E0NMUS8	0449212343	164791951	Rules of Marriage	Books	3	12	12	N	N	Proceed with caution	Seventeen year old Charlotte has long been infatuated with Kit, a handsome, dashing Marquis. When they meet for a few minutes, Kit finds her intriguing and decides to marry her. Delighted to oblige, Charlotte is married straight from the schoolroom. <br />It doesn't take an expert to see trouble coming, and come it does. Twelve years older than she is, Kit has bored of the glittering Regency social world that Charlotte has just entered.<br />He is wrapped up in social work for the poor, which is sorely needed but causes him to overlook trouble in his marriage. Charlotte, inexperienced in the adult world and angry at Kit's neglect, begins a flirtation with an admirer. A flirtation which, one weekend, becomes a brief but disastrous affair.<br />It's mostly from this point I had a problem with the story. Kit's response to her lapse is brutal (and hypocritical, since apparently he didn't hold marital fidelity so important before marriage). He spares Charlotte a divorce, but only if she lives permanently retired in the country, and, of course, causes no more &quot;scandals.&quot;<br />Since this is romance novel, the rule is that all must end well. To this end, Kit's harsh behavior is eventually explained away. For me, though, it was like watching backstage while a magician performs her tricks. Bishop showed too much unpleasantness in Kit for it to be romantic to have him restored to the &quot;hero.&quot; <br />Since Bishop is an excellent writer, the story does have its points. If it weren't for his abusive streak, Kit would be an acceptable hero. I wanted to like him. Charlotte is intelligent and spirited. While incarcerated by her husband, she grows in an interesting way as she, too, learns about the hardships of the poor.<br />Bishop's keen eye for human nature is here in the secondary characters, in particular some of Charlotte's &quot;fair weather friends.&quot; The character of her mother didn't quite ring true, though. <br />From a historical standpoint, it is well researched. If you are interested in Regency history, especially the post-war depression that caused hardship for the poor, and the various social remedies that were suggested (many of which haven't changed), you will find this a painless education. You'll also find out why Georgette Heyer characters always ask for &quot;the latest crim. con. stories.&quot;<br />To sum up: this novel has its good points, but don't expect an escape to a more elegant, romantic era. On the contrary, it made me thankful to be living in a time when husbands don't have so much power over wives.	2002-10-11

When I have read through all my favorite GH, and I haven't read this one for a while, it's fine. However, I agree with assessment of Vidal as a spoiled brat (or a bully), and with his attempted violence toward Mary. Not romantic!<br />It has always bothered me, too, that the happy ending depends on Mary convincing the Duke first, that she's a &quot;lady&quot; (in effect, that she and Dominic have not &quot;been together,&quot; and that there's no way anyone can gossip to the contrary); and second, that's she's so disinterested, she'd work as a servant in a foreign country rather than marry Vidal and endanger his inheritance. I don't think Dominic is worth that much selflessness, frankly. And I note that virginity is not a requirement for him, only for Mary.<br />The Alastairs in general are not my favorite characters. On the one hand, they have charm and charisma. On the other, arrogance, snobbery and ruthlessness. I do like Leonie, but can only take the rest of them in small doses, say every two or three years.	2002-09-23
US	50386604	R2ICB2F16PWPKE	0449503127	381188881	Rosalba	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Unusual but too short	This story examines something Regencies rarely do, or used to rarely do: the story of a woman who lives as a man's mistress rather than in respectable marriage. Through a combination of a runaway husband, lack of money, and falling in love, Rosalba becomes the hero's mistress. <br />The story touches on some interesting issues, since the couple's social life centers around other couples who are outside the pale of \\"polite society.\\" In an era when divorce was difficult, painful choices were forced upon lovers, especially women.<br />The story is sensual without resorting to graphic sex scenes, another plus.<br />The problem is that the story is really two novels, one in the above setting, and another with the couple in a small country village with a mystery to solve. The characters and situations important in the first half disappear in the second. Neither story is completely fleshed out. There just isn't enough space to do that. So although the book kept me reading, I was left disappointed that the first half of the story was more or less abandoned.<br />Many of Bishop's novels suffer from this. You are left wondering what the story would be like if it had been a little longer and more thoroughly told. Her best novel, The Durable Fire, proved she could do this quite effectively. Whether this was the fault of her publishers or her own time constraints, it is still a loss.	2002-09-20
US	50386604	R1SGRS8YO6TC2V	0449236951	902201906	Highwayman	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Proceed with caution	S. Thorpe is a very talented storyteller, especially in the &quot;swashbuckling adventure-romance&quot; genre. However, even good storytellers have their off days. <br />To me, the book is an interesting example of that. Everything seems slightly backwards. Important dramatic moments of the story happen off-stage, so the reader can't share them. The four main characters (a main couple and secondary couple) irritated me so much that at various points I wanted to slap them all. (Patience is perhaps the most sympathetic, but so spiritless that she will drive some readers up the wall.)<br />Rowena, the heroine, is strong-willed, spirited and the most likeable character of the four. However, she runs herself into so stupidly into danger, over and over again, that she becomes absolutely exasperating. She doesn't even have the common sense to behave cautiously in a thieves' den. The one time she courts danger and it makes sense (a terrifying scene: she goads the extremely dangerous villain into a fury, as part of an escape plot, but it backfires) the suspense is resolved in a disappointingly undramatic way. <br />Gil, the hero, is overbearing in his pursuit of Rowena. We are supposed to believe he loves her, but there is no proof of that.<BR>On the contrary: he knows her brother, his friend and her guardian, is bent on forcing Rowena to marry Gil against her will, and this obviously doesn't bother him. <br />It would have been interesting to see Gil grow from a Restoration rake selfishly pursuing Rowena, to someone mature enough to see how selfish his behavior has been, and willing to try to win her when she is free to accept or reject him. Then the best elements of Gil could have reached their full potential. As it is, he comes across slightly schizophrenic: an arrogant rake sometimes, at others a more likeable man.<br />A little more suspense about Gil would have been effective, too: He is connected in some way with Captain Fury, a notorious and brutal highwayman who hasa mysterious power over Rowena's brother, Peter, and his love, Patience. <br />Rowena distrusts Gil and is sure the connection is disreputable. The reader is given just enough information to suspect that it isn't. Sharing some of Rowena's suspense and distrust would have been more fun. And a scene where Gil is mistaken for Captain Fury and imprisoned loses much of its dramatic and romantic potential because the well-connected Gil is so nonchalant about it.<br />Peter, Rowena's brother, is another problem. Rowena loves him enough to run into ridiculous amounts of danger for him, but it's hard to see why. His determination to force her into marriage with Gil, regardless of her choices or her feelings, makes him come across as tyrannical, selfish and humorless. In her place, I'd be tempted to leave him to his fate. At least then she could choose her own husband!<br />Patience and her father are an innkeeper and his daughter who maintain the headquarters of Captain Fury and his gang. They are in his power, though the secret of the father that keeps them powerless I found more distasteful than sympathetic. The father perhaps deserved his fate, even if the daughter didn't.<br />Captain Fury is the best part: a frightening and repellent villain. As much as the main characters irritated me, I couldn't wish for him to win. However, when he is ultimately vanquished, it is one of those moments that you want to share, but that takes place undramatically &quot;off-stage.&quot; A major mistake!<br />The book does have a few pluses: the atmosphere and dangers of Hounslow Heath, a highwayman's haunt, are effectively evoked. The opening chapter is quite gripping, and the story afterwards does have its moments. It was just that what was wrong with it outweighed what is right.	2002-08-26
US	50386604	R21JA3AG1Y7VHW	0449212335	488637997	Speaking Likeness	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Enjoyable	This story kept me turning pages. <br />My chief criticism is that the romance took a backseat to the plot: who is Elizabeth, and who fathered her baby? This has been a tragedy for Elizabeth, and will cause more pain in the family circle, and it tends to take over the story. However, it an is interesting enough question to keep you involved, and Mr. Wood, the hero, plays an important role.<br />Sheila Bishop does know how to keep her readers engaged and in suspense. She also knows how to write intelligent characters. Diana and Mr. Wood are likeable (Diana perhaps a little more so than Mr. Wood, who is a little hard on his own son), and the secondary characters are mostly people you can imagine yourself knowing.<br />As in many of her books, adultery and its consequences play a role. One problem was that I felt one character's understandable anger was given short shrift (it seemed included primarily to give Diana a reason to feel superior), and some conflicts were resolved too quickly. Other than that, a fairly satisfactory afternoon's escape.	2002-08-26

I started this with only medium expectations, just looking for a good weekend read. I didn't feel it even came up to that. I was hoping for a story and a world that would grip and engage me. It just didn't happen, and after the first few chapters, I gave up and skimmed the book.<BR> <BR>Three things were to blame: The characters, including the two main characters, Eilan and Gaius, were not particularly interesting or given enough development. I never got swept up into the love story, maybe because they seemed so spiritless, submitting without protest to their parents, or in the case of Dieda and Cynric, to Avalon (if she and Eilan looked so much alike, what would have been simpler that to have Eilan take her place?) And Goddess forbid they force their parents' hands by becoming lovers!<br />Caillean and Lhiannon, the priestesses, are each in their separate ways, too depressed and/ or powerless to make good characters to identify with. Gaius' wife Julia could have been a strong, interesting character, but she tapers out.<br />I didn't feel the ancient worlds were evoked very realistically either (although I admit I skimmed most of the Avalon sections). Sometimes it reads more like someone displaying their research than creating a world (which MZB is fully capable of doing.)<br />The final problem I had, which led to my skimming most of the book, was the strain of sexual puritanism in the portrayal of Druid/Goddess culture. The emphasis on virginity for women (to the point of fathers killing women who \\"shame\\" themselves) has more to do with patriarchal cultures and religions than Goddess-centered ones. Certainly there is no research I know of to back up this view. From what I know of the Darkover series, this seems to have more do with MZB than ancient religion.<br />Ancient artwork shows that Giving Birth, Mother and Child, and God and Goddess Making Love, were among the most sacred symbols of Goddess cultures. Itseems the height of absurdity to imagine, then, that women called to serve the Goddess would be required to forswear both love and children. That would be like stopping the circle of life itself. <br />Toward the end of the book, Gaius says sensibly to a young Christian: \\"I find it hard to believe in a god who would condemn his followers for creating children, or for the act that creates them.\\" Or a Goddess, either.<br />Perhaps the saddest thing is that earlier in her career, MZB would have created characters, especially female characters, who wrestled with these questions, rebelled, even left to create lives for themselves. Hawkmistress is about a young girl who does just that. Stormqueen, though not a feminist novel per se, certainly has women (and men) who ask themselves hard questions about the world they live in. And it is hard to imagine Jaelle, of the Shattered Chain and Thendara House, submitting meekly to her father's decrees, although Jaelle has her own problems from being raised in a fundamentalist-Islam type society.<br />I also hated the requirement about Forest House, that only the \\"most beautiful\\" women were allowed to serve. What a slap in the face! That's like saying \\"only the most handsome men are allowed to train as bards.\\" What has one thing got to do with the other?<br />Well, I know for many women their only taste of the Goddess comes through MZB's Avalon books. That's fine; I'm sure they contain some good things. I felt a little of that tug myself when I started the book, but it was quickly outweighed by what annoyed me. <br />If you are interested in another perspective, try MZB's central Darkover books (from the '70s). Or Cerridwen Fallingstar's The Heart of the Flame.	2002-06-30

However, Ms. Bishop manages to pack a great deal of both plot and suspense into this short space. The strong points are watching the main character evolve from a gauche girl to a young woman whose dreams are beginning to come true; and a story that keeps you engaged and guessing. I read almost all in a single sitting, though I didn't intend to.<br />The one negative point is that the book was written when the double standard for men and women was alive and well, and it forms one of the central points of the story. The unfairness of it kept me gritting my teeth. Other than that I enjoyed it, although the character of the Vicar's wife is perhaps a little overdrawn.	2002-06-30
US	50386604	R64X8PXZLQXG0	0449502082	739639593	Consequences	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Passable but flawed	When it comes to Sheila Bishop, I am a collector; however, her heroes sometimes have a disturbing abusive streak. <br />This is true of James, the main male character of Consequences, who is expert at making harsh & rather humiliating criticisms of his wife.  It is Lavinia's response to and fear of James' judgments that drives the plot. And, frankly, it's hard to enjoy a love story when you don't like the hero. <br />The most enjoyable love stories in the book are the other two: middle class Patience and her naval officer; and the servants Evan and Jenny. Even so, I could hardly be happy with the \\"happy ever after\\" ending. <br />However, Bishop is an expert plotter, so it is interesting to see how she sets up a series of actions and consequences that fall together like dominoes, leading to a suspenseful end. And her characters are mostly interesting and well drawn: people you could imagine knowing.<br />Another Sheila Bishop novel with the above mentioned problem was her adult contemporary Desperate Decision. The hero is obsessively jealous and physically violent. By the end of the story, he has learned to suppress his physical abusiveness into a kind of psychological tyranny, similar to James in Consequences. Sadly, Sophie, his wife, accepts this, and even accepts that part of blame is hers, not for being \\"unfaithful,\\" but for being too attractive. The man she should end up with becomes a peripheral character. Not at all a satisfying love story.<br />It was a disturbing book to read and much as I like Sheila Bishop, I decided to give it away as soon as I finished it. It certainly made me wonder, rather sadly, what the author might have suffered in her own life to write so knowledgeably about abusive men.	2002-06-08

I am a great fan of Sylvia Louise Engdahl's novels Enchantress From the Stars and the Far Side of Evil. I was pleased to find this book, which I'd never heard of, in my public library. <br />I read it in one sitting, absorbed by Melinda's struggles, by her friend Alex, and by the philosophical themes that underlie  Ms. Engdahl's work.<br />Though it was an interesting story well told, I did feel compelled to dock it a star. The author has a definite bias in favor of space colonization, and all of the conflicts in the novel are weighted towards that. <br />Poor Janet, the space-phobic biologist, is the novel's strawman (or woman): all of her objections to colonization are so extreme, they are set up only to be knocked down. I felt the same about Melinda's flaws: To arrive at a faraway place without much idea of how people actually live, (particularly when you've never wanted to visit!) isn't provincial, just human.<br />Another reason for docking it a star is the novel's adaptation of the concept of Manifest Destiny, glossing over the more brutal flaws of that inspiration to expansion. <br />Ms Engdahl believes that expansion and exploration are a challenge humanity needs to rid it of war (explored more thoroughly in The Far Side of Evil.) However, America's own history proves this is not so; sadly, we bring our problems with us, rather than leave them behind. New territory alone does not solve them.<br />That is not say there is no value to the idea of space exploration and colonization. It is true, after all, that humanity needs challenges to grow. I also believe, as she does, that a society with too much material comfort, and too little challenge, can become corrupt, even decadent.  <br />I don't agree, though, that space exploration is the only answer. Though the idea is raised only to be dismissed, there is value to the idea of solving our problems before we export them to new worlds. Certainly there are challenges enough here to demand our creatively, commitment, intelligence and courage for generations to come. Perhaps we shouldn't wait to solve *all* of our problems before venturing to other worlds, but we should at least learn how not to exploit an environment simply for what it offers us. <br />Now back to the story:  Unlike so much science fiction, the conflicts and situations are rooted in what is human and believable, rather than some \\"futuristic\\" idea of how people should behave. This is what makes the story so gripping. Melinda meets challenges and grows, without coming across as unusually perfect or good. Alex slowly becomes her friend and guide. It would have been easy for his character to come across as two dimensional or insufferable. Instead he is intelligent and fairly wise, but not flawless.<br />I did feel a little uneasy with the issue of Melinda's longing for Earth, and how that is resolved--or rather, never fully resolved. One thing is clear: changing planets isn't like changing continents; it is going to an environment entirely hostile to humans. Longing for air, water, plants, animals, Earth landscapes, weather, is more than homesickness. It is longing for the very stuff we are made of, and that makes us. I also had trouble believing that her choice must be a one-time all-for-nothing one, since Melinda is something of an heiress, and could therefore afford more than one trip. There was a little too much sacrifice in the resolution of that conflict for me. <br />In spite of my misgivings, I was moved, left unexpectedly happy and hopeful, by the ending, especially the final paragraph. <br />Bottom line: If the book is in your public library, get it! (along with her others.) You won't regret it, especially if you know a girl or young woman who loves new worlds and loves to read.	2002-06-02

At first it is the story of two families coming together, and Mary Dacre's attempts to make a family, and deal with puzzling aspects of her new husband's behavior, especially his contemptuous treatment of his gifted elder son. She discovers his cruel tongue and harsh judgment can be turned without warning against herself, which poisons the marriage. <br />Finally, when the situation seems hopeless, a full picture of her husband's past and suffering is revealed. However, even that wasn't quite enough for me to accept some of his actions, which included brutal abandonment of someone entirely dependent on him. Two abandonments if you count his first wife.<br />The strong points of the book include Bishop's ability to write a gripping story, to build suspense that keeps you reading. This was never a story where I could guess what was coming next. I enjoyed Walsingham's cameo appearance in the story, and found him a more believable character than in, say, the recent movie &quot;Elizabeth.&quot;<br />I am not necessarily sorry I read the book, but it is definitely not a pleasant story about two people discovering each other and falling in love. I had to dock it a star because it was not the light evening's reading I was expecting, or that most purchasers would expect.	2002-01-08

She and her best friend Lucasta are just emerging into adulthood. Lucasta falls in love. But something unexpected happens and Nell leaves the village, not to return for 6 years. <br />When she returns, attention focuses on that mysterious event of six years ago. The best record is the journal that Nell kept during that time. Everyone who reads it has a different interpretation of what happened. But what did happen? Only Alexander Mortlow knows for sure, and he is not telling. Is his secrecy evidence of guilt? Nell, finding herself attracted to him, worries that it may be. <br />All of Bishop's intelligent observation of people is here: of character, multilayered motives, naivete and sophistication, requited and unrequited love, even the effects of mental suffering. That is what I like best about Bishop: her characters seem more like observations of real people than &quot;romance novel&quot; characters. <br />The story is set against an unusual background of amateur theatricals, and it will surely keep you guessing.	2002-01-08

I was a little disappointed. I agree with reviewers who called it meandering, and light on character development. The strengths of the book were in Starhawk's ability to imagine and illustrate differing realities, and in her attempts to extend her political vision into a vision of how an immanence based society could function.<br />For example, I will never forget how she establishes the poverty and scarcity of water under the Millenials, only to show that the rich have water and everything else in abundance. And her vision of a pagan utopia would be fascinating to see on film, except that Hollywood is every bit as patriarchal as the fundamentalists and would never do it justice. <br />One thing I wonder about is the tendency to divide the world into &quot;good&quot; Pagans and &quot;bad&quot; Christians.  <br />Time was, it wouldn't have bothered me, but since then I have met many people who define themselves as Christians, even conservative Christians, who are good ordinary people; and I have run into plenty of dysfunctional and patriarchal behavior in the pagan/Goddess community. Friends in SF these days tell me that much of the pagan community there is far from what we had in mind when we did those first tentative rituals in the '80s. <br />In short, I find myself questioning the book's polarization of people and even societies into camps of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; Turns out it just doesn't work that way.<br />There was one strange omission: it never addresses the status of Jews under the Christian Fundamentals. Are they persecuted? Now, of course, I also find myself wondering what the status of Muslims would be, as well as Catholics, Buddhists and any other non-fundamentalists or non-Christians.<br />Technically, I think the story would have benefitted from another draft. In a long epic story like this, everything should have a point that works into the central story and creates the final outcome. But when I looked back on it, some episodes seemed disconnected or pointless. <br />Ultimately, I prefer Starhawk's non-fiction. However, I still give the book 4 stars because it's clear that it serves as inspiration, healing or awakening for many people, and that means it accomplished its purpose.	2002-01-02
US	50386604	R2UK3SR1SRLGT6	0449217337	342345593	A Well-Matched Pair	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Interesting	This is a gripping,             readable story, but take warning: it is essentially a sad one. I had trouble being completely satisfied with it. For one thing, only a tragedy can finally allow the lovers to be together--and there are some good questions about how guilt might poison their relationship.<br />For another, I wasn't sure I liked the hero. Bishop originally shows him as a not very likable man, and that was hard to shake. There is an interesting scene near the end where, based on a misunderstanding, the heroine pithily sums up his character. Although all is cleared up in the end, I couldn't help but feel there was some truth in that summing up. And you know, the ideal romance is one where you are as in love with the hero as the heroine is:)<br />Bishop's intelligent observation of people and relationships is here, though. There is always the sense in her books that you are dealing with real people living through trials and learning from them the way people really do. <br />Her Edith grows from a young, untried girl to a poised woman. The character of the Duchess is handled nicely, although I find it sad that she suffers so much guilt for a kind of infidelity it's taken for granted her husband has the right to commit. <br />There is also some nice inclusion of children in the story, and their characters add an extra dimension you don't usually find in romance novel. <br />So, recommended, but don't expect a frothy story a la Georgette Heyer.	2001-12-31

Unfortunately it merely mirrors our culture's general sexual ignorance.<br />I have worked for years both with survivors of sexual violence and the sex industry, and those who advocate for them. I know many of the realities (rather than rhetoric or fantasy) involved. Realities that include violence, economic exploitation, drug addiction, and high levels of post-traumatic stress syndrome. Realities that include inescapable misogyny, as is only natural when you set aside one class or gender of people to service another.<br />I know that prostitution in particular is dependent on a division of women into human beings and whores. It plays on the economic and social gulf between men and women. Such a division affects all women, and all men as well. <br />Of course, I realize that there will always be those who project an \\"anti-sex\\" ideology on those of us willing to look honestly at these issues. Which is where the silliness comes in, because it is only by addressing these issues (rather than denying them) that you can begin to create a sexuality that is based on equality and humanity. <br />The attitude of the author is unfortunately based on denial, which does nothing to solve the problem, or even address the issue. It simply perpetuates the myth that it is the \\"liberated\\" vs the \\"repressed.\\" Because of her youth, however, I was willing to give it two stars, rather than one.<br />I was extremely surprised, however, to find this book noted on a \\"witchy, feminist, pagan and proud\\" [...] list. My advice to that list owner: Go back and read Starhawk. You have missed her by a mile if you think this kind of attitude is genuinely connected to the erotic.	2001-12-28

Some characters and situations remain underdeveloped, which is a negative since I enjoy Sheila Bishop's ability to create realistic people and relationships for its own sake. However, the mystery is suspenseful. I could hardly put the book down until it was solved. Ms Bishop is also clever at turning around our perceptions of one character. This doesn't always work for me, but in this case she won my sympathy for &quot;Richard III.&quot;	2001-12-23

It has pluses: a mystery running through the story, Bishop's ability to build suspense and curiosity that keeps you reading, her intelligent observation of character and human nature.<br />However, I couldn't help feeling that the evil of one character in particular was overdrawn. Sometimes less IS more. In fact, so many evil qualities were heaped on this particular character that in the end I found myself liking her in self-defense. By contrast, another character just as bad is excused and generally given an inordinate amount of sympathy.<br />Also, part of the story revolves around a servant girl thrown out penniless to fend for herself. A great deal of deserved sympathy is generated for her, so it's odd that another, minor character, a young girl kept as a mistress by one of the villains, is referred to with such contempt. After all, it's the idea that the first servant girl might have easily fallen victim to just such a life that generates so much indignation on her behalf.<br />Even more odd is that the second girl in no way contributed to the suffering of the first. The neglectful or destructive actions were inflicted by others. It's an odd carry over of a double standard that should have vanished long ago.<br />From a romantic point of view, the story suffers from being told from the man's point of view. It was necessary for the mystery, but it keeps Celia, the heroine, from ever being a life-like character. For example, the way she grew from being a humble, uneducated strolling player to a trained singer who mixes easily with the nobility is never quite explained. In spite of that, the story did generate enough emotion, with the hero growing from selfish pursuit to deep caring for Celia, to keep me engaged.	2001-12-23

He used both common sense and intelligence, and rarely found himself swept up in the fantasies that abound in Egyptology. This book is an excellent example of his meticulous work. Read, for example, his chapter deciphering the contents of KV55. Not just the mummy, but the shrines and other objects, found in a hopeless jumble. Guided by what is simple and probable, he presents a reasonable explanation of how the tomb was found in that state it was; and how such a mixed burial, with objects referring to Akhenaten, Tiye and Smenkhara, came to be.<br />He also treats Akhenaten's &quot;monotheism&quot; with much less awe that it is usually given. He points out that it wasn't quite a religion ahead of its time, but a return to Old Kingdom sun-worship, and that it was by no means monotheism as we now consider it.<br />To respond to the issue raised in the review below: Aldred didn't invent the theory of Froelich's syndrome. It was a going theory at that time, as Egyptologists tried to find an explanation for Akhenaten's unique and somewhat feminine appearance. <br />Aldred knew the disease caused impotence. A working theory for many Egyptologists was that the disease went into remission  before it made Akhenaten sterile. Aldred does present the idea that Amenhotep III might have fathered the children, if Akhenaten had been unable to. However, he then shows artwork of Akhenaten in mourning, with a growth of beard, showing that he did have secondary sex characteristics. Aldred then concludes the most likely theory is that Akhenaten fathered his own children.<br />In regard to the &quot;incest-mania&quot;: that, too, was a going theory, not one invented by Aldred. It results from the fact that Akhenaten's three eldest princesses all evidently had daughters when they were very young, and when they were not married. Inscriptions refer to the these infants as &quot;child of the king.&quot;<br />The theory goes that, in a mad attempt to have a male heir of fully royal blood, Ahenaten fathered children on his own children. A distasteful thought, but his own father married his daughter, Akhenaten's sister Sit-Amun, so again there is some basis for the idea.<br />Aldred also discusses the co-regency of Smenkhara. I personally think he would make short work of current theories that the ruler was really Nefertiti in drag, ruling as Pharaoh. For one thing, he discusses funerary objects (ushebtis) with Nefertiti's name on them which come from about the year 14, the year she &quot;disappeared&quot; or was &quot;exiled.&quot; So it would seem likely she died at that time. For another, the body in tomb 55 is a royal male body, evidently an older brother of Tutankhamun. And portraits of King Smenkhara look nothing at all like Nefertiti. They do, however, show family resemblance to Akhenaten and Tut.<br />To return to the disease that plagued Akhenaten, I think author Bob Brier has it right. He has identified the disease as Marfan's syndrome, which causes, among other things, unusually long fingers and toes. He outlines his theory in his book about King Tut's death. His theory about the boy-king's murder is a bit farfetched, but his work on Marfan's syndrome would seem to be a breakthrough in solving this mystery. <br />If you are remotely interested in this brief period of history, Aldred's Akhenaten is a must-have.	2001-12-10
US	50386604	RBXGVU2L53XXO	0553378392	108708273	Walking to Mercury	Books	3	13	14	N	N	A bit disappointing	I have been an admirer of Starhawk's work since I read The Spiral Dance in 1987. Although largely ignored by mainstream progressives, her work does a great deal to extend the revolutionary ideals of the '60's and '70's into spirituality, psychology and culture. I have great respect for her as an author and leader. <br />However, I feel her greatest talent for communicating her message lies in non-fiction rather than fiction. The poetry and lyricism of her ideas and insights come through much more clearly. <br />To be blunt, although the magic comes through in bits and pieces, the book is also a more or less stereotyped visit to '60's activism. I also felt there was a lack of depth to the character development. Sure, there's a lot of &quot;action,&quot; plot, but a real sense of knowing, or perhaps caring, about these people was missing for me.<br />Also, given that Starhawk is also a '60's activist who has become a leader and visionary of the Goddess revival, it's hard not to see Maya as a thinly veiled version of herself. Evidently Starhawk doesn't want this, but if she didn't want Maya to be taken as a stand-in for her, she would have been better off creating a character with a different history. It was harder to take Maya as a character with a life of her own, when I couldn't help but feel this was all too strongly filtered through Starhawk's own life. <br />I do tend to agree with the &quot;Gen X&quot; reviewer who was exasperated with the characters' self-centeredness. For one thing, I didn't like the vision of relationships with no fidelity or commitment. Johanna's statement &quot;I'm not a one-woman dog&quot; just seemed cold and selfish to me. Where's the love?<br />Well, I realize this all sounds negative, especially next to those glowing reviews. My advice is still to read Starhawk's earlier, non-fiction work. You'll have a much more powerful sense of what the novels are trying, often with less success, to say.	2001-11-27

For one thing, I got the feeling the author intended a more elaborate plot, but settled for something simpler. For another, I didn't feel Helen, however bad she might be, deserved her harsh fate. The book is rather dated (and misogynist) in that sense.<BR> <BR>*****<BR>I decided to add more to this review, because on second thought I realized what was missing: romantic tension between the hero and heroine. <br />Adrian, the hero, is having an unfortunate affair, and turns to Christina, the heroine, because she is the exact opposite of Helen, his beautiful, self-centered mistress. Christina is intelligent and has integrity; she is also crippled and virginal. Fine to start out with, but she is never allowed to blossom out of that. Not usually a problem in Sylvia Thorpe romances. <br />There is a lot of plot distraction: threats of forced marriage, betrayals, a kidnapping; but it doesn't quite solve this problem. This leaves the actual love story lacking, though Christina and Adrian are likeable characters. However, I mostly found what I look for in this author here: readability, history, and romance.	2001-10-29

The story is fairly short, too. Perhaps if it had been more fully developed, it would have suffered less from a comparison to GH. There are some intriguing characters and situations set up here, ones that bear the imprint of the author's own personality. But unfortunately the book is somewhat underwritten, and so they are never fully developed. However, the author is an accomplished enough writer that the story does provide some enjoyable escapism.<BR>Sir Greydon Varleigh is a good hero (though with a strange name.) He lacks the harshness or coldness that tend to mark GH heroes, and the overbearing or domineering characteristics that too often mark Sylvia Thorpe heroes. Dione is a nice, determined, intelligent heroine (even if I have a pretty good guess who she is modelled on.) I just wish the story had been filled out a bit more.	2001-10-29

It also continues the story of Charity and Darrell, and provides a little glimpse of Roxanne, of Roxanne &amp; Tom. As a long time reader, I enjoyed all of that. <br />However, the story line about witch hunts was disturbing, because rather than take the ironic attitude towards witch hunters of Dark Enchantress, for example, the author chose to take seriously the existence of evil-doing covens, even the idea of evil magic.  This was a strikingly superstitious note in a work of romantic fiction. It treated Puritan paranoia and persecution of women as somewhat reasonable, not my view at all.	2001-10-29

I agree with the reviewer who said the book lacks practical advice, real applications to everyday life. I find Estes' connection of fairytales to the psyche intriguing and powerful, but something is lacking.<br />An example: There is the story of the seal woman who skin is &quot;captured&quot; by a man, who is forced to marry him, and then eventually escapes back to the sea. <br />Estes connects this story to loss of one's true self, and equates this with clients she's had who have experienced a  major sense of theft in their lives, as in theft of opportunity, for example. She talks about visiting a prison and finding that nearly every woman she worked with had experienced a soul theft and was in the processing of reclaiming her true self. Powerful stuff. <br />She promises through the subsequent tales to show how a woman can &quot;come home&quot;. I eagerly read through, but was disappointed to find that the advice boiled down to: read a favorite poem, sit in a favorite rocking chair. Advice that would work for healing everyday stress, but not for the kinds of &quot;soul-thefts&quot; she originally discussed. In other words, no meat. <br />There is another problem as well, and that is the lack of feminist analysis of fairytales, which were often coded stories of oppression. The seal woman's marriage is a good example. She interprets this as the marriage of the soul to the practical everyday world. However, it also obviously speaks to another, more painful reality of women's lives: forced and/or abusive marriage. And the child who results, the &quot;soul-child&quot; is also the child who helps his mother escape and return to freedom. This consciousness is entirely lacking in her analysis, and helps crystalize what I feel is lacking in the book.	2001-02-26

Sadly, feminists have become the scapegoats of our culture. But many of the problems discussed here come from the defeat, not the success, of feminism. <br />The author, and many readers, are too young to remember or understand how the sexual revolution was influenced by the severe sexist attitudes of liberal men.  It was they who decided how women's bodies were to be used, how sex was to be thought about, and what say women were allowed to have about it all.<br />Men like Hugh Hefner, Larry Flynt, and Bob Guccione were proudly hailed by liberal male thinkers as the &quot;philosophers&quot; of this revolution. Women's preference for sex to be part of relationship was ridiculed by liberal men. In the '70's, it was treated as a mark of female inferiority.<br />It's also important to remember that women being viewed as objects was a part of men's treatment of women long before the sexual revolution. Strip clubs, prostitution and porn all existed then, and will continue to exist as long as men have economic power over women. They are expressions of domination, and they certainly exist in, for example, Muslim countries that insist on &quot;modesty&quot; for women, just as they existed in Victorian times. <br />Shalit's lack of understanding of both feminism and patriarchy does hamper her message. However, I found it worthwhile. One of the worst ills created by the sexual revolution was the detachment of sex from love and caring, and I respect her for naming that, and working to reconnect them. Sex only within the bounds of marriage is not everyone's solution, nor should it need to be for sexuality to be rehumanized.<br />The bottom line is that no woman should feel she has to have casual sex, or feel her desire for sex to be an expression of love is &quot;unliberated.&quot;	2001-01-03

For me the most inspiring part of the book is her phrase &quot;I wrote Lost Soul Companion because it didn't exist and I wished it did.&quot; <br />I enjoyed the book, and found some of it useful, but I did wish it had covered topics in more depth, especially the &quot;surviving on your art&quot; vs &quot;taking a real job&quot; issue. I wish the author had covered in more detail her own experiences trying to make it in the California art world. What was that like, and what made her give it up and return to the midwest? That might be something she could cover in Volume II, which I hear is now in the works. <br />Also suggested: interviews with artists at various levels of &quot;success,&quot; meaning ability to support themselves.

This one had some promising elements: A poor relation enters high society, but she has a secret to hide. A blackmailer enters her life. It threatens her newly found love for the hero. But after setting up this plot, the book ends abruptly with a quick resolution, like the author ran out of time. I would recommend Romantic Lady instead. It is set in Regency Society, and is more satisfying to read.<br />Pluses include the fact that the author generally wrote better villains than Heyer. One minus is a strong similarity to Friday's Child.	2000-12-29

I have been fascinated with this period since I was a little girl, and I could hardly put the book down the first time I read it. <br />Pauline Gedge knows Egyptian daily life very well, and her strength is in recreating it. As far as the historical events and personalities go, sometimes I agreed with her interpretation, sometimes not. <br />The idea that Tiye married Akhenaton is not historically verified, though it does weave together some facts in an intriguing way. I first discovered that interpretation in a book called Oedipus and Akhenaten, which theorized that Akhenaten was the historical Oedipus, and Gedge has certainly gone with this interpretation. It is intriguing for the novel, and she makes a good case, especially in details like the role of the seer, Amenhotep son of Hapu. I have to say, though, I don't really believe that it happened this way. I also disagreed with her view of Akhenaten as a weak dreamer. He was many things, possibly mad, but anyone looking at sculptures of him can see that, whatever he was, he wasn't weak. <br />I have the same feeling about Nefertiti and her &quot;viper heartedness.&quot; To suit certain interpretations of the facts, Nefertiti had to be made vain and power hungry. I'm sure she wasn't perfect, but I just couldn't see her as the hollow, shallow character she was made to be.<br />Other interpretations were spot on, or at least interesting. I liked the relationship of Mutnodgeme and Horemheb, and the tragic love story that weaves delicately through the major part of the novel. Ankhesenamun and Tutankhamun's brief, sad story felt real to me, as well Horemheb's eventual motive for murder. <br />One thing this book did leave me wanting: The story of Amunhotep and Tiye in their youth.	2000-11-17

For women, reading it is a particularly empowering experience, a reclaiming of our ancient heritage. I think, however, it could be an empowering experience for men as well. <br />Fallingstar shows both what it means to be a man in a male supremacist culture, and what it can mean to be a man outside of patriarchy, in a culture that celebrates the sacred humanity of both woman and man, goddess and god. <br />One of the underlying themes of the book is how male domination corrupts men, and like all supremacism does, destroys their humanity. <br />We see young Fiona and Annie, best friends, learn about their ancient heritage from the elder women of the village, a heritage stretching in to ancient times, perhaps to the origins of humanity. We experience their intense bond, their falling in love, with each other and with young men who cross their path. As another reviewer noted, each eventually meets her true mate, both men of power and magic. <br />Ms Fallingstar's portrayal of the lovemaking scenes was consciousness-raising for me, since it showed once and for all that there is a definite, indivisible line between the erotic and the pornographic. One is based and grounded in humanity; the other in ownership and domination. Women have had it beaten into us that if we are anti-porn, we are anti-sex. It was joyous to re-discover that this is not so, and to find writing that depicts that so beautifully.<br />This is a story about the Burning Times, so it does end tragically. I want to include a warning here for anyone thinking about getting this book for their teen daughter, or any reader who is a survivor of violence. The end of the book contains vivid descriptions of rape and torture from the victim's point of view and is traumatic to read.  Otherwise, this book is a must.	2000-11-01

His death led to the reign of Ramses II, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, so if it was murder, then it was a murder that changed history.<br />Since the damage to the king's skull has provoked theories that he was murdered, including myself, I'm glad that someone finally decided to investigate the idea. I was fascinated by Brier's case, even if at times I had to take him with a grain of salt. <br />The book also discusses something I've often wondered: what happened to Ankhesenamun? Either she lies in an undiscovered tomb, or she was never given one. Why would a queen of Egypt--even if she was murdered--not be given a royal burial?   And a lost theory about the letters to the Hittites, which Pauline Gedge uses in her novel The Twelfth Transforming, is that Nefertiti wrote them when Akhenaten died. That's possible, since she, too, had no sons. And the idea makes more sense coming from a mature queen.<br />Gedge also theorizes that Tutankhamun's murder was committed by Horemheb, the man of action, when he saw that there would be no heirs to the throne. This seems more likely than an old man, who established Tut on the throne, who was related to him--and who could easily have seen to it that he did not grow up.	2000-10-23

Picking it up one day, I was intrigued to discoverthat it had little to do with Christianity, and more to do with Judaism, trends among modern young women and the author's own observations and feelings.  And though the background she writes from is politically conservative, her message actually has its roots in good feminism, in feminism's tradition of observing the conditions women actually live under, their benefits or lack there of to women, and trying to find a solution. This solution isn't everyone's solution. A wholesale return to virginity for women or men isn't really practicable. But increased respect for the idea that sex and love, sex and relationship, sex and commitment should be connected, is hardly a bad idea, or one that is really against women. Naming the reality that those things tend to go hand in hand for women is certainly not wrong, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's about time women reclaimed our right to consider lovemaking an emotional, deeply bonding experience that even gives us the right to expect some commitment from our partners. A cultural that treats sex as really separate from love and even humanity is not healthy, and expresses that disconnection in severely sexist ways, as we can see so clearly by looking at the average cable TV or video offerings.	2000-02-20

Often he is vague, and makes a few  claims I find completely unbelievable. And he uses a technique I find  irritating- extensively  ''recreating'' the subject's thoughts, or private  incidents. Now, he doesn't know what Gene Kelly's thoughts were, unless he  had access to a journal or diary or his autobiographical notes--which  clearly he did not, because he does not cite such notes as a source. And if  by chance he did, quote THOSE, don't use fiction. This is a trend in  biographies, but not one that, to me, creates a believable insight into the  person concerned.<br />I don't expect to see Gene Kelly portrayed as someone  without flaws, but I do expect an honest, balanced, well-researched  portrait. Colleagues and friends interviewed  for the 1974  biography by  Clive Hirschorn, a work Yudkoff quotes frequently if selectively,  were  honest about his perfectionism and high standards, his competitiveness and  Irish temper, and his demanding rehearsal techniques. But this author, it  seems, tries to give the man flaws he didn't possess. <br />For example, it   portrays him as a kind of absentee  father, vowing to spend more time with  his kids and never quite managing,  but his eldest daughter spoke to  Hirschorn of his dedication  and concern as a father even at the height of  his career, and said of him, ''He wanted so desperately to be an excellent  father-and he was.''<br />Another  example: Yudkoff tells a story that one  night, LB Mayer asked Kelly to dance with Vivien Leigh, which he did, but  that she was so drunk that Kelly asked her if they could sit out the rest  of the dance. Kelly told this story differently to his biographer; forexample, that Leigh asked him to dance, not the other way round.  Yudkoff  quotes only part of Kelly's story, without explaining that he tells the  story very differently from Kelly, portraying his rude treatment of her as  fairly intentional, while Kelly used the story to illustrate his  awkwardness at big social functions. Nor does Yudkoff cite a source for his  version.  Since this incident is used to illustrate Gene Kelly's character  (with some fictional recreation of his thoughts),  the discrepancy is  disturbing.<br />This new bio makes a few revelations, but in the absence of  direct quotes from sources, it's hard to know what is reliable. There is no  real in-depth insight into his relationships or artistry. Anyway, it makes  me hope his autobiography will still be published. There is definitely a  place for it.	1999-12-27
