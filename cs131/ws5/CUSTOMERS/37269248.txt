Salzman's writing style sparkles with enthusiasm and the energy of youth; a feeling of discovery for whatever is newly learned; and a view of everyday life experiences with a feel for adventure, a conversion of the mundane into the extraordinary.  Salzman not only mastered wu-shu, but he also mastered the written language that emits sparks on every page.  Even his daily meditations reverberate with intensity.<br /><br />This is an ideal book for a young adult who lacks motivation or skills to move onward.	2005-01-13

On a \\"sentimentality scale\\" of 1 to 10, I would rate this collection of 20 stories a 7; but, a magnificient seven. <br /> <br />My introduction to this collection was by way of the Bruderhof website, that included \\"No Room in the Inn\\" by Katherine Paterson.  A very well-written short story that tells the message of Christmas with a New England directness and with dry humor that bites. It remains my favorite in the compilation. <br /> <br />The collection includes a few old classics such as \\"The Christmas Rose\\" and \\"The Other Wise Man\\". <br /> <br />Four of the stories are written in a humorous style that sound better when read aloud for an audience.  They include \\"Riders of St. Nicholas\\", about three cowboys left on the ranch to fill some idle time; \\"The Vexation of Barney Hatch\\", like a tale from O'Henry; \\"The Carpenter's Christmas\\", cussing and hammering as a devotional prayer; and \\"Willibald's Trip to Heaven\\", a Tyrolean tale of a creche maker who fights with St. Peter.  Both young and old will enjoy these four tales and they would lift the spirits of anyone stuck in the hospital over the holidays. <br /> <br />Pearl Buck's \\"Christmas Day in the Morning\\" is a sentimental, yet beautiful tale that would have a special appeal for anyone who has worked on a dairy farm.   <br /> <br />A common thread of kindness links each of these stories.  An added bonus are the woodcut illustrations by David Klein that accompany each story.  What an appropriate Christmas gift!  I'll buy a few copies of Home for Christmas to give as gifts for next year.	2004-12-27

Bernanos has written a provocative novel in the form of a diary, where the nameless priest writes his most intimate thoughts.<br /><br />Each entry reveals the trials of a truly humble man who is troubled by his inability to pray; \\"...that the wish to pray is a prayer in itself, that God can ask no more than that of us.\\"  He struggles with his physical pain and awkwardness, \\"But I hadn't lost consciousness, I was simply a prey to my suffering, or rather to the menace of it, for the certainty of its return was a greater agony that the pain itself...\\"; temporal insecurity, \\"There must be something for my absurd self.  The way in which I neglect my appearance, my natural clumsiness against which I no longer struggle, even the morbid pleasure which I feel at the thought of certain injustices...does not all this cloak an illusion whose origin in God's eyes is impure?  ...instinctivly I put myself in the wrong; I can see other people's point of view.\\"; spiritual doubt \\"Am I where Our Lord would have me be?  Twenty times a day I ask this question.  For the Master whom we serve not only judges our life but shares it, takes it upon himself.\\"; and the emotional anguish brought upon by the parishoners who he serves.<br /><br />The central character is humility, in the guise of the young priest.  A humility that is much more than an absence of pride; it's a gift comprised of compassion and spritual poverty.  That gift is grace and Bernanos has given humility the human dimensions that make it alive and observable.  With literary brilliance he has raised it to heights that forsake its lowly origin.<br /><br />Everywhere there is suffering and sacrifice, yet not all is gloom and doom.  The final words from his dying lips, \\"Grace is everywhere\\" come as no surprising revelation.	2004-12-19

Pieper defines leisure not as we understand it in the 21st century, but within the philosophical-theological context of divine play and its impact on the intellect as it was universally accepted from the pre-Christian Greek philosophers and later developed by Aquinas.  The importance of leisure was unchallenged until Kant usurped it in 1796 with a philosophy of reason and work; &quot;...the law of reason is supreme, whereby property is possessed through labor.&quot;  Kant's philosophy gained acceptance and became well suited to the industrial revolution which soon followed.<br />Pieper takes the command &quot;Be still (at leisure) and know that I am God&quot; - Psalm 45 and distills it from there.  Leisure is non-active; it is receptive and consists of contemplation or celebration.  Like grace, intuitive and creative thoughts are communicated while at leisure.  I find Pieper's premise true because my most inspiring thoughts come while taking a shower or while on a walk through the woods.  Einstein would also agree, because he was riding his bike when the theory of relativity crystalized in his mind.  <br />Also in this 160 pge book are Pieper's 1947 lectures collectively entitled The Philosphical Act.  He begins by quoting Thomas Aquinas, &quot;The reason why the philosopher can be compared to the poet is that both are concerned with wonder.&quot;  It flows from there.<br />Pieper's philosophy is reflected today in the Slow (Food) Movement.  It's also understandable how Pieper made a significant impact on E.F. Schumacher and his Buddhist economics as contained in Small is Beautiful.	2004-07-14

Dunson has given these children a personal identity.  In each story, from Uganda to El Salvador, we know the children's names, their fear, their struggle, and their resolve.  Sometimes there is hope and when it is absent, Fr. Dunson convincingly assures the reader that not only can we make a difference in their lives, but we have an obligation to make that difference.<br />Fr. Dunson sounds a call to action:  \\"A just, humane, and compassionate world community would never tolerate the massive indifference shown today toward the unnecessary suffering of children.  Humanity's real weapons of mass destruction are hunger, preventable disease, and indifference - and these weapons of mass destruction are killing our children as we watch.  Ultimately, there is no such thing as other people's children.\\"<br />While reading the book, BBC News reported over 200 people were massacred in a refugee camp in Uganda.  They interviewed a 14 year old boy, Innocent, who witnessed his parents being hacked to death.  Three weeks later (3/21/04), BBC did a follow-up on Innocent's life in an orphanage.  This news report and No Room at the Table convinced me that I must take greater action.  Acts of solidarity with children are offered in the book's conclusion.  The last page is a prayer by Archbishop Tutu: Peace for the Children of God.	2004-04-04

Most stories are followed with a commentary that provide insight for further reflection.  In the preface, deMello instructs the reader to read each story three times before moving on to the next, taking time to reflect on its inner depth and meaning.<br />I followed deMello's instruction and confined my reading to one parable or tale each morning.  Throughout the day it would return to me, either to amuse, enlighten or both..  Interestingly, I was already familiar with many of the tales but viewed them differently in the past.  deMello has generated a refreshing, sometimes novel, interpretation that always inspires.<br />Song of the Bird is a book that will be read again and again.  The compilation is proof that although Truth has many ways of revealing itsself, it remains consistent and eventually reveals itself to all who seek it.	2004-02-27

In defense of the term Goldwater said something like:  \\"Fanaticism in the defense of freedom is a virtue.  The soldier who gives his life to protect our freedom is a fanatic.\\"  I remained comfortable with this until I read War at The End of The World.<br />Vargas Llosa's historical novel is a study on fanaticism and obsessions: religious and patriotic fanaticism, fanatical idealism and obsessions of power, material possession, and sexual pleasure.  Every chapter has samplings of these destructive forces, which succumb to villainous misfortune even when the intent is righteous and honorable.  Llosa does a superb job in creating multi-dimensional characters who are driven and eventually destroyed by that inner force which decries moderation.  It's frightening that we can see all these forms of fanaticism and obsessive behavior all around us in today's world.<br />This novel of epic proportion utilizes events as a backdrop for the players.  There's excessive violence which is described in profanely graphic detail.  But, I can't recall any novel where all the characters are exposed in such intimate detail.  Every quirk, vice, virture; every musing, distraction, and feeling are revealed.  Vargas Llosa leaves no thought unexplored or unchallanged.  The one exception is the central character, the Counselor, who remains an enigma throughout the book.  <br />I strongly doubt if anything was lost in translation.  The translator, Helen Lane, kept the writing fluid and very much alive.	2004-01-31

With Commentaries	Books	5	114	119	N	Y	Not Only Beautiful, But Also Practical	In my college days I struggled with economics and barely passed.  My economic professors and the course material were dull, ambiguous, and non-stimulating.  None of these adjectives could be used to describe Schumacher's Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered.<br />Schumacher makes economics come alive with wit, humor, and practicality.  His approach is qualitative, not quantitative. A recurring statement throughout the book epitomizes his philosophy, &quot;Why use the computer if you can make the calculation on the back of an envelope&quot;?  He gives the science a personality when identifying the disparities between the rich and poor, the educated and uneducated, and the gap between city people and country-folk.<br />Small is Beautiful created a humanistic economics movement.  It's a wholistic approach containing ethical, ecological, and metaphysical components that are missing from the statistical models that solely measure GNP.  Schumacher sounded the alarm regarding globalization when asking &quot;how much further 'growth' will be possible, since infinate growth in a finite environment is an obvious impossibility&quot;. He was critical of a society that generates unbounded materialism, and motivated by greed and envy.<br />Some of the more interesting of the 20 essays are: &quot;Peace and Permanence&quot;, &quot;The Role of Economics&quot;, &quot;Buddhist Economics&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Resource - Education&quot;, &quot;Technology with a Human Face&quot;, &quot;Development of Intermediate Technology&quot;, and &quot;Two Million Villages&quot;.<br />Although the book was written in 1973, it is as timely now as it was then.  The 25th anniversary edition contains provocative updates provided as sidebars by contributors such as Hazel Henderson, Peter Warshall, Amory Lovins, Godric Bader, et al.	2003-12-19

I couldn't get past the first 50 pages.  I was unprepared to accept Hesse as a humourist and satirist.  Now, approaching 60 and having learned not to take life or Hesse so seriously, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and consider it Hesse's greatest.  A mature Hesse, who understood life's ironies, wrote The Glass Bead Game for a mature audience, who could laugh at life's ambiguities.<br />The Glass Bead Game is comprised of a novel, 13 poems, and 3 short stories.  I think the reader would enjoy the novel more by reading the book in reverse order, starting with the three short stories: The Rainmaker, The Father Confessor, and The Indian Life.  The underlying theme of the stories is that the forfeiture of self, or self-interest, leads to redemption or an awakening.<br />The poems superbly unite the novel's cultural, spiritual, and mental perspectives.  Hesse's best known poem \\"Stages\\" is included.  Here's a four line excerpt:<br />\\"If we accept a home of our making,<br />Familiar habit makes for indolence.<br />We must prepare for parting and leave-taking<br />Or else remain the slaves of permanence.\\"<br />The novel is set in the future and located in the sequestered province of Castalia.  This is a world of academia that consists of theory, analysis, interpretation, and debate - all elements of \\"the game\\".  Absent from Castalia are action, creativity, originality, and experiment.<br />The protaganist, Joesph Knecht is raised in this culture.  He also lived at a couple of subcultures outside Castalia. At Bamboo Grove, under Elder Brother's tutelage he learned to meditate, play I-Ching, read Chuang Tzu, and learn Chinese studies. (All this self absorption without gazing at his navel; instead, he stared at the carp.)  Later at a Benedictine monastery he was the guest of Father Jacobus, with whom he discussed politics, religion, philosophy, music, and history. Knecht learned everything to play \\"the game\\" and was elevated to the role of Magister Ludi.  But his knowledge went unapplied beyond Castalia.<br />Even those within Castalia were not immune to mid-life crisis.  Knecht, while in his 50s is impacted by the words in \\"Stages\\":<br />\\"Serenely let us move to distant places<br />And let no sentiments of home detain us.<br />The Cosmic Spirit seeks not to restrain us<br />But lifts us stage by stage to wider spaces.\\"<br />Anyone who has made a break from the routine will enjoy The Glass Bead Game.	2003-12-06

The personal essays of aid workers compiled by Bergman are profiles of ordinary people doing the extraordinary.  Each essay reveals a unique writing style and personality.  The one common thread that they share is a strong willingness to serve humanity; hence, they're humanitarians.<br />The compilation consists of 15 essays.  None of the locations would be paradise because the hell-holes span the globe to wherever there are wars, the aftermath of wars, conflicts, and natural disasters.  Personally, I'm pleased to read about some of those aid organizations that I support. <br />Here are a few of the more memorable pieces:<br />Camp-bo-dia by Dr. Panayotis Ellinas, a doctor serving the many needs of Cambodians in a Thai refugee camp.  Dr. Ellinas grew up on Cyprus where he witnessed &quot;napalm bombs, death, destruction, and occupation.  A scene with pained faces comes back to me often...This is what led me to my vocation.&quot;  More than empathy, more than compassion; the doctor has great respect for his patients and colleagues.<br />The House of Prayer and Peace written by Sister Theresa Baldini underscores a strong commitment of caring.  Sister Theresa, who in 2002 was 63 years old, and Sister Madeline, age 79, have served in Sudan since 1986.  The two Maryknoll nuns have endured not only continuous aerial bombings, several bouts of malaria, and countless rats; but also an austere diet of lentils, peanut butter and crackers, and cabbage.   And there's no mention of burn-out!<br />My Bodyguard is a poignant account by Patrick Dillon of his 10 year old Somalian bodyguard, Muhammad Ali.  I'll connect with young Ali whenever I use my Swiss Army Knife.  (You'll need to read this essay to know why.)<br />Paul Heslop's Letters Home is full of grit and humour as he describes his daily routine of defusing mines in Angola.  <br />Overall, each story provides great insight, something more than what could be read in official agency newsletters.	2003-12-05

Gutierrez has written about \\"liberation theology\\" in layman's language.  Not only is the book informative, it is a guide to personal spirituality.<br />After completing the book, I find it difficult to understand why \\"liberation theology\\" has been such a controversial topic within the political and church establishments for the past 30 years.  Why had a US government study claimed \\"liberation theology\\" a greater threat to Latin America than communism?  And why had the authorities in Rome silenced both Gutierrez and Boff for their positions on liberation theology?<br />We Drink from Our Own Wells is formated into three sections.  The first section contains two chapters that define \\"new\\" spirituality as practiced among the poor in Latin America.<br />The second section is comprised of three chapters that focus on scripture; particularly the gospels of the evangelists and the epistles of Paul.  Much attention is given to the social gospel of Christ.  The concepts of flesh, spirit, and body are extensively discussed, as are the terms \\"discipleship\\" and \\"community\\".<br />The five chapters in the final section are summarized in Henri Nouwen's superbly written Forward: \\"...filled with deeply moving texts written by Christian men and women who have experienced persecution and suffering but have been witnesses to the living and hope-giving God in the midst of their sufferings.\\"<br />The 202 pages include 33 pages of notes, 4 pages of scripture references (over 200 entries), a 15 page Forward written by Henri Nouwen, and a 5 page Preface by Gutierrez for the 20th Anniversay Edition.	2003-11-23

It is the best written, most comprehensive book on meditation; as suitable for the beginner as it is for someone like myself who has been meditating for almost 30 years.<br />Although deMello intended the book to be a guide for group meditation, it serves the individual as well.  In Sadhana, deMello has conjoined Eastern and Western techniques whose origins include Ignatian and Benedictine methods, yoga, Zen Buddhism, and Christian mysticism.  The result is 47 exercises that are broken down into three groups; awareness, fantasy, and devotion.  deMello's Jesuit proficiency as a teacher is reflected as he guides the reader through each exercise.<br />I have supplemented my meditation schedule with several of these exercises and as a result, my spiritual development has become enriched.	2003-11-07

Sister Dianna Ortiz' story had to be told and more importantly it must be heard.  The first person account of her torture and rape is horrorific, but even more shocking is the scale of crimes committed against the people of Guatemala.  Ortiz is even handed in describing the atrocities performed by the guerrillas as she is in telling on her torturers, the Guatemalan military.  As an American, it is disheartening to learn about my country's involvement by providing military and financial aid to a regime that massacred thousands.<br />Ortiz reveals in grisly, personal detail the physical, mental, and emotional abuse she suffered beyond her 24 hour detention.  Her memoir is extremely painful to read.  The turmoil she has experienced for more than a decade has not silenced her, instead, she has become a voice for those whose cries cannot be heard beyond their cell.  Her memoir is a testimony for all torture victims.<br />The Blindfold's Eyes would have received a 5 star evaluation had there not been two major flaws:<BR>1) The statistics of those killed and disappeared vary from different sources as they appear on different pages (p. 47, 183, 350, 422)from 20,000 to 47,000 disappeared and from 100,000 to 200,000 killed.<BR>2) Ortiz' objectivity becomes diluted during the DOJ investigations.  Her characterizations in that time period are very judgemental; tribute is given to those who support her and those who oppose or question her are villanized. No one is neutral.	2003-11-07

His journal covers his early monastic life from 1946 to 1952 and is an intimate look inside the cloister of Gethsemani.  The life of a monk is not as idyllic or full of ritual as my preconception.  There is quite a bit of manual work, particularly in the fields where even Merton's hands became calloused from digging ditches.  The daily activities make for enjoyable reading.<br />Also revealing are Merton's laments about his assignment as a writer.  He found writing to be an unpleasant task causing great dispeasure and dissatisfaction.  Over time, after his ordination, writing provided the quiet and solitude he sought. But he was a harsh critic of his own books.  This is what he wrote in his journal about Seeds of Contemplation:<br />&quot;There is nothing to be proud of in this one, either.  It is clever and difficult to follow, not so much because I am deep as because I don't know how to punctuate, and my line of thought is clumsy and tortuous.  It lacks warmth and human affection.&quot;<br />Although there is some truth in his self-evaluation, it cannot be said about The Sign of Jonas that it lacks warmth and human affection.  And his poetic style shows in several entries.  The Sign of Jonas is certainly in the &quot;top 10&quot; of Merton's books and will be read again.	2003-10-20

Nowhere in the book could the joy of walking be found.  Solnit creates a thin trail that connects walking with philosophy, politics, revolution, sexism, prostitution, and literature.  Her disjointed rambles sidestep the topic with dull, uninteresting anecdotes that dissuaded this reader from turning the pages.<br />But there are pleasant intervals.  The most interesting parts of the book are when Solnit writes of her walking experiences.  Her first person narratives draw the reader into a lively cadence when she describes her inner-city walks in San Francisco, her pilgrimage to Chimayo and her people-watching jaunt along the Las Vegas Strip.<br />Solnit is a gifted writer who is extremely fluent.  It's unfortunate that she ambled about unrelated activities and chose the experiences and words of others when she could write much more interestingly about her own walks.  As an avid walker, I was disappointed with her book.	2003-10-17

It was like being introduced to several writers, each one distinctly different, dependent upon the medium.<br />Tagore's five short stories in this anthology are folkloric, sometimes sad or humorous, somewhat other worldly, and always entertaining.  They expose the hues of Bengal better than paintings with their brilliant characterizations and finite details of place and time.  Here's a sampling from The Raj Seal: &quot;An old story came to his mind.  An ass was pulling a temple car along the sacred way, and the passers-by, prostrating themselves in the dust before it were offering their pranams. 'They are all worshipping me,' the foolish ass thought. 'There's only one small difference between that ass and me,'  the elder brother told himself.  'I have at last realized that it is not my person the British sahibs respect, but the jacket weighing on my shoulders.'&quot;<br />Tagore's play The Post Office is included in its entirety.  It's very childlike and simplistic in structure, yet it is poignantly profound with its message that death is serene; &quot;...that great ocean of truth to which all life returns&quot;.<br />The Nobel Prize for literature was awarded to him in 1913.  Part of the tribute was for Tagore's poetry, particularly Gitanjali; however, there is too small of a sample (four stanzas) to truly appreciate it.  My favorite from the anthology was Flute Music, an autobiographical poem.<br />Tagore the philosopher is evident in his essays and letters.  In his letters he takes on the persona to whom the letter is addressed.  The debate with Einstein &quot;On the Nature of Reality&quot; leaves the reader uncertain as to who was more convincing.  A rebuke to Gandhi reads like the good counsel of a loving older brother.  (It was Tagore who gave Gandhi the honorific title, Mahatma.)<br />The three excerpts from his novel The Home and the World have induced me to order the book, which is still in print.  When Hermann Hesse reviewed the German translation, he praised it for its &quot;purity and grandeur&quot;.<br />Now, I could only hope for more of his writings to become translated and accessible.	2003-09-29

Sabatier, a French Protestant wrote a very objective biography that portrays Francis favorably, but tells how his order of spiritual brothers was challenged by ecclesiastical authorities.  I was surprised to learn that meek and gentle Francis could also be bold, stern, and assertive in many situations.  He did not go gently when he reprimanded his brothers and there were several occassions when he did so.  <br />It's a good translation and finely edited by John Sweeney, who has added sidebar annotations that contribute to understanding the people and places in Francis's time.	2003-09-09

But Brazil is a dynamic country, particularly its economy and that has an impact of all prices quoted in the 5th edition (2002).  The actual prices in 6/2003 for meals, accommodations and transportation were consistently 15 to 20 percent less.  Bus schedules changed, but not their itinerary and frequency.

The information they give for consonants t, d, and r is incorrect because it is only partially complete. <br />Where and how to exchange money needs to be updated, especially when exchanging cash.  <br />Budget and moderately priced accommodations for Rio should be expanded.  (Frommers does a better job in this area.)<br />Visa information needs to be updated.  A Brazilian visa now costs $100 for US citizens.	2003-09-08

Seldom has the work of an editor paralleled that of the writer, but when it happens the end product is better than the sum of its parts.<br />Durback has harvested every resource of Nouwen's spiritual essays, taking excerpts from books, magazine articles, and unpublished journals.  They touch upon the human journey in a personal, intimate style; a style that has made Nouwen one of the most widely read spiritual writers of the past century.  In this anthology his essays define hope and they definately communicate hope in an inspiring manner.  I don't feel that Nouwen ever acquired the hope he was seeking, but his desire to capture it for himself, as well as for others, was a lifelong pilgrimage of his.  In his search, he shared with his readers the struggle and the ideal of nearing perfection.<br />Compassion was one grace Nouwen was not lacking and could be found in every topic he wrote about, whether expressed implicitly or explicitly.  Here's a sample:<br />&quot;Compassion lies at the heart of our prayer for our fellow human beings.  When I pray for the world, I become the world; when I pray for the endless needs of the millions, my soul expands and wants to embrace them all and bring them into the presence of God....In praying for others, I lose myself and become the other, only to be found by the divine love which holds the whole of humanity in a compassionate embrace.&quot;<br />The second edition includes a 50 page Memorial Tribute that tells of Nouwen's life as a person and as a writer.  There's also a great 18 page bibliography.	2003-09-06

Without any difficulty, I could easily recommend any of his books except The Inner Voice of Love.<br />Nouwen never intended to publish his journals when he wrote them while undergoing treatment for severe depression.  The notes he wrote were a part of his therapy.  They are personal and are a written record of the anguish he experienced.  This book is a cry of rejection, disappointment leading to dispiriting emotions, where his words of consolation sound empty and insincere.<br />This is how it begins:<br />&quot;There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss.  You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible.  You have to work around it so that gradually the abyss closes.&quot;<br />Midway through the book he continues:<br />&quot;You have to be willing to live your loneliness, your incompleteness, your lack of total incarnation fearlessly, and trust that God will give you the people to keep showing you the truth of who you are.&quot;<br />This book is very depressing.  Anyone not familiar with Nouwen should read Seeds of Hope: A Henri Nouwen Reader.	2003-09-06
US	37269248	R3340SPQW0KGBX	0824506715	596539802	Saint Francis: A Model for Human Liberation (Saint Francis Model Human Liber PR) (English and Portuguese Edition)	Books	3	8	8	N	Y	Gentleness and Care	This is not a biography; it's a commentary and analysis of St. Francis within a psychological, philosophical and theological context.  With academic detail, Boff describes Eros (desire of love, passion and compassion), Pathos (affectivity through empathy and sympathy), and Logos (order by rationality and reason).  From these concepts he explains at great length the Franciscan dynamic of &quot;gentleness and care&quot;.<br />Boff's St. Francis is neither a reformer nor a revolutionary, rather a man who is intensely charged with love for the crucified Christ.  This love is channeled by embracing the poor through the way of poverty and living the words of the Gospel.  Boff does this so convincingly that I suspect his analysis of St. Francis is an unconscious account of himself.  In spite of all his scholarly research (this book is heavily annotated), Boff comes through as a result of his intuitive knowledge and experiential understanding of poverty.  He does not identify his mentor St. Francis of Assisi as an effeminate sissy, but as a fully integrated saint in possesion of strength and compassion.<br />I would rate this book five stars for content and two stars for readability.  It would be much more readable if Boff employed poverty, or economy of words.  There are many redundancies in the 157 page book.  The vocabulary could be simplified.  Some words such as pneumatological, simonious, ecclesiogenesis, and historic-salvific were not in my Webster's II University Dictionary.  And there is an abundance of non-translated Latin words and phrases throughout the book; sacerdotium, conversio morum, stabilitas loci, in paupertate altissima et mendicatione humilima, and regio dissimili tudinis.	2003-09-02

Originally published in German as &quot;Die Morgenlandfahrt&quot;, or Journey to the Land of Light, it is a spiritual expedition by members of a secret League.  Written in the first person, HH (Hesse) seeks his dream only to lose it through despair.  He learns despair can be transformed to creativity just as creators of art, music and poetry have proven.  This short novella could be read within a rainy afternoon, but the prose is so fluid you'll want to read it again, even when the sun is shinning.	2003-09-02

Written by Hesse in 1904 when he was 26, it is a precursor to his famous works.  In Peter Camenzind, Hesse reveals a naivety, innocence and humor that is rarely found in his later writings. <br />Here is an excerpt that relects the lyrical quality of young Hesse: <BR> &quot;These thoughtless words made me realize that the helpless cripple, beseeching, suffering Boppi, whom we did not love, whom we wanted to get rid of, sat sad and alone, locked in one room....And then I remembered that I had told the neighbors in Assisi about St. Francis and had boasted that he had taught me to love all mankind.  Why had I studied the saint's life and learned by heart his hymn to love and tried to retrace his footsteps in the Umbrian hills, when I allowed a poor and helpless creature to lay there suffering though I could help him? <BR> The weight of an invisible, mighty hand fell on my heart, crushing it with shame and hurt, and I began to tremble.  I know that God wanted a word with me.&quot;	2003-09-02

This is an anthology of his writings, edited by topic in chronological order.  It's an autobiography revealing Gandhi's evolution from a fearful young man, afraid of the dark, to a fearless leader who feared no rebuke by an empire.  More than an aesthete in a modern world, Gandhi's complexity is revealed in each passage as he penitently reveals his transformation into selfless service and living simply.  His words and actions inspired others to follow without fear of retaliation and could guide today's leaders to a peaceful resolve.  The book reads like a primer on non-violence.<br />Eknath Easwaran's 18 page Preface is worth the price of the 339 page paperbound book.	2003-09-02
US	37269248	RTGDUF6ITMKUO	0883445506	873577320	Introducing Liberation Theology	Books	4	22	24	N	Y	Missing the personal experience	The Boff brothers, Leonardo and Clodovis, have written a scholarly text suitable for the theology student.  Their compendium outlines liberation theology by clearly defining the function, structure, themes, and history with adequate explanations of theological terms that would otherwise baffle the non-indoctrinated.  This book is written for the reader who has an interest in knowing the socio-analytical, hermeneutical, and practical mediations. Get the message?<br />If the purpose of the book is to inform, then it is adequate.  But it will not win any advocates for the liberation theology movement.  With the exception of the opening pages which describe the desperation of the poor with two heart rending experiences, this book is dry tinder in search of burning embers of the human element.  The Boffs have many experiences with the poor, the oppressed, and the marginalized that could have brought to life the conceptual and the abstract.	2003-08-27

It's a chronicle of his sabbatical year which was intended to provide a restful time for prayer, writing and solitude.  In actuality it became the most active period in Nouwen's life.  Although he always made time for prayers and writing, there was little resolve for solitude; either people sought him or he invited their company. Not a week went by that he wasn't on a plane or train visiting family and friends, attending meetings and conferences, performing sacramental and ceremonial rites, always moving at a space age pace.<br />Nouwen's diary reads like a travel essay.  There are several spiritual nuggets to be found on his non-travel days, but most entries are of his observations and experiences with an accompanying commentary.  Unlike travel writers, he never describes a meal by describing the food; instead he gives an account of the dinner conversation, the topics, the mood, the intensity, and the background of every dinner guest.<br />Travel stories are peopled with diverse characters that reflect different cultures and backgrounds.  Nouwen offers his readers a personal glimpse of over 600 people; all sparkle with individual personality and purpose.<br />Only a talented writer could elicit such strong empathy for the traveler who loses keys for the rental car, drops suitcases on the airport's escalator, and always packs more gifts than necessities. I enjoyed Sabbatical Journey as a well-written travel book with a spiritual perspective.	2003-08-25

Nouwen	Books	5	21	22	N	Y	Wounded Prophet	I've found much inspiration from Nouwen's spiritual writings and was hesitant to read his biography, because I didn't want to separate the singer from his songs.  Michael Ford did just that; he exposed the humanness of a writer that I thought to be exclusively spiritual.  Ford paints a sensitive and colorful portrait of Henri Nouwen.  He neither condems his frenetic, unsettling character nor canonizes the personality of an intensely gifted spiritual writer.The biography is a well-written account of a life of conflict that evokes admiration, humour, sympathy, annoyance, and irritation.  Ford performs a wonderful balancing act offsetting the faults and flecks with abundant virtues.<br />Nouwen's personal conflicts are revealed with such spiritual intensity that would have gained approval from The Wounded Prophet.  Ford describes his dependence on others for love, recognition, even praise; his restlessness and inability to remain focused, except when writing; his tumultuous anxieties, which eventually led to severe depression; and the perpetual questioning of his sexuality.  Ford has introduced me to someone whose company I would not enjoy; loud and animated, always distracted, unable to make a pot of coffee or launder his own shirts.  But I also met a man whose life of unbounded love and compassion exceeded anything he wote.<br />Michael Ford has written a truly spiritual book about a truly spiritual person.	2003-08-19

Someone with an inflated self-serving ego who was obstinate, insulting and ruthlessly competitive.  His mouth had no gatekeeper to prevent the insolent, unkind remarks he hurled at others. <br />Then came a diagnosis of cancer.  It jolted him into a new reality; one where other people shared an importance that he held exclusively for himself.  Reading about his cure and transformation were both encouraging and inspiring.  After  the cure he expressed his gratitude by serving others unselfishly and magnimously. <br />On a different, more entertaining note, I really enjoyed reading about the Tour de France.  <br />At the book's conclusion, I felt Armstrong should be awarded an honorary degree in philosophy from a distinguished university.  His learning experience, which he shares through his candid autobiography is anything but abstract.  It is life altering.<br />Lance Armstrong and Sally Jenkins have written a tour de force.  I give it high marks for content and style.  Reading each page felt like having a personal conversation, except my comments to Lance went unheard.  I look forward to a sequel.	2003-08-19

Carlo Petrini's Slow Food: The Case for Taste is such a book.  True to his Italian character and culture, he describes the Slow Food movement with style and exuberance.  He would make a convert of me if I had not already embraced his philosophy for the &quot;good life&quot;.  I share his passion for excellence in food and wine and the responsibilities that are attached to this pleasure.  Petrini would make an excellent dinner guest, bringing gusto and reverence for the meal served and adding intelligent, sometimes jovial chatter throughout each course.  <br />Back in the 70s, E.F. Schumacher wrote Small is Beautiful, creating a movement that eventually became a cliche.  In smallness we find our human scale and through smallness it is possible to express our uniqueness.  The Slow Food movement has taken this concept and added a few additional ingredients which make life pleasurable.  I think Petrini's book can have as strong of an impact on the new millennium as Schumacher's book had in the 70s.<br />Much credit should be given to the translators for maintaining the integrity of Petrini's literary style.	2003-08-13

He enthusiastically sounds the message, line by line, as a call to action.  Each sentence bursts with energy and presents a challenge for us to live not only for ourselves but in communion, in solidarity with one another.  Boff has reformulated Franciscan ideals into a twenty-first century context.  He challenges world order, global economics, consumerism, and wasteful productivity.  If I didn't know who wrote this book, I would suspect a consortum that would include Gandhi, Dorothy Day, Peter Mathiessen, Thomas Merton, Mother Teresa, and Ralph Nader.<br />Two additional lines appear in this Prayer for Peace: &quot;where there is discord, union&quot; and &quot;where there is error, truth&quot;.  They do not appear in the traditional prayer, but belong there along with Boff's good counsel.  This ecumenical message should be read by every political and religious leader and even those of us who lack the motivation to make a difference in our world.  Boff's commentary enlightens and inspires us to be instruments of peace.	2003-08-03
