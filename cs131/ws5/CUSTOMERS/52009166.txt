Too often tries to motivate continuum derivations by discrete arguments, and then the continuum argument is presented at best incompletely. I would prefer to see a systematic development with full explanation via Ito calculus, one can then discretize when needed. But the nontrivial stochastic differential equations required to describe real finance market data (the empirically correct equations) dx=R(x,t)dt+&#8730;D(x,t)dB(t) where especially D(x,t) depends nontrivially on both x and t, with x=lnp(t)/po, are not discussed in Neftci or any other financial engineering text.<br /><br />Some bad mistakes in Ito calculus and also conceptually can be found in ch. 21: eqn. (75) is wrong, a partial time derivative is missing on the rhs (there are no stationary processes in finance, including the Osborne-Black-Scholes Gaussian returns model). This mistake propagates into another serious mistake on pg. 285: eqns. (80-82) are certainly neither a backward nor forward Kolmogorov equation, are simply wrong. See either Stratonovich (\\"Topics in the theory of Random noise\\", vol. 1) or McCauley (\\"Dynamics of Markets: Econophysics and Finance\\") for forward and backward time Kolmogorov pdes. See also the basically unreadable but highly stimulating books by Steele (\\"Stochastic Calculus\\") and Durrett (\\"Brownian Motion and Martingales\\")for extensive discussions of the 'Kac-Feynman' formulae and several different pdes (one can follow their discussions of the latter topics).	2005-10-06

Sidney Redner provides us with a stimulating and masterful treatment of first passage times from the standpoint of traditional statistical physics. This is both the strength and weakness of his attractive book. What's lacking is a systematic formulation with simple examples continuous in (x,t) that the reader can solve for herself. The formulation of the hitting probability for the simplest diffusion problem (the Wiener process) as a problem in electrostatics (pg. 24) is nice but woefully incomplete and inadequate, and is related to Durrett's ('Brownian Motion and Martingales in Analysis', 1984) attempts to formulate potential problems via Brownian motion averages using stopping times. What's missing in Redner's electrostatics approach can be found in Stratonovich's \\"Topics in the Theory of Random Noise\\" Vol. I: the use of Kolmogorov's backward time diffusion pde to calculate the average stopping time for general time translational invariant diffusion problems with variable drift and diffusio coefficients. And see Steele's \\"Stochastic Calculus\\" for a formulation of hitting times (stopping times) using Martingales formulated via Ito calculus and stochastic differential equations. Steele provides many interesting and instructive examples, including  a simple calculation ofthe average stopping time for Wiener processes with and without drift (the Durrett-Steele Ito approach is much shorter than Stratonovich's Fokker-Planck method, and both approaches are instructive). Actually, Durrett (1984) shows assigns the most general method as 2 exerecises on pg. 255: to calculate the average hitting time by constructing a martingale that leads to solving the same backward tiome pde as Stratonovich, but for the general case of (x,t) dependent drift and diffusion coefficients!	2005-09-16

I bought this book after reading in the last chapter of Steele's \\"Stochastic Calculus\\" that this would be a good reference for constructing martingales via pdes for the case of x-dependent diffusion coefficients. An introduction, this book certainly is not, nor is it practical or even useful for nonspecialists. I can hardly imagine a worse divergence between reality and an author's stated belief of what the book really is. Richard Durrett states in his introduction that he intends to present coherently the material that would otherwise require understanding many other difficult books. He also complains that his former editor refused the ms, so he went to CRC. Like many other topics in the book, e.g., \\"Martingale\\" is not defined, the author simply refers to his other books! Steele's book is extremely difficult: I cannot follow many of his proofs but his examples are stimulating and can be worked out. The examples show how the theorems work, which is practical. Generally, one example is worth a thousand theorems. Durrett's book is 'practical' in that he does offer exercises, and apparently Steele took his execises from this book. I would have wished for better editing, all authors suffer from too little criticism.<br /><br />Note added later (and I should have given 2 stars): Durrett's 1984 book \\"Brownian Motion and Martingales in Analysis\\" looks somewhat more readable and has some examples. In fact, the examples in Steel, as well as the Martingale discussion of his last chapter, may be motivated by or come from the 1984 book. It's often the case that an author's later books on a particular subject are not as good as his earlier ones.

We're hiking from south to north through Germany toward the Baltic, east of Munich northward for about 10 days each summer, so we pass through many villages where there is memory of Gustav Adolph's Thirty Years War. And where better to read about that collection of events than from a good Swedish writer? So far, I'm only into the second chapter but can recommend the book highly. The first chapter describes the last years of the war, ending with the attack on Warsaw. There, Englund describes how the Polish cavalry, beautifully clothed and with a tradition of fighting individually as sport within the herd, was slaughtered by the Swedish war machine. The Swedes apparently had the latest advanced weapons and were highly trained. They were the Romans or Americans of the seventeenth century.<br /><br />The history is written in novel form, following the life of one well-known Swede from birth through his 31st year.

One basic idea is that financial markets are inherently unstable, and deregulation makes them even more unstable. Second, but related, there are social needs that cannot be met by `market solutions'. This is the opposite of what's taught in standard economics texts, where the Pareto Optimum is presented as if it would describe real markets (but empirical evidence indicates strongly that it does not). Recent empirical research shows that Soros is right: financial markets are neither stable nor show any tendency toward either dynamic or statistical equilibrium. According to Soros, imposing `market discipline' means imposing market instability, and he is right, empirically seen.<br /><br />Soros presents his argument in the interest of preserving the global capitalist system, as opposed to any desire to destroy it. Rightwing pundits, blinded by free market ideology, are unable to read his words objectively. The central point of the book is that \\"market fundamentalism\\" (radical free market ideology, or free market extremism) is a greater threat  to a free society today than is totalitarianism. The book was written in 1998 before Islamic Fundamentalism in the Mid-East, and Christian Fundamentalism in the US, made their aims fully apparent to the rest of us.<br /><br />Pointing out that preferences are not stable, which is opposite the notion of time-invariant preferences taught in mathematized  neo-classical economic ideology, Soros contrasts two extreme societies: `transactional society', where everything is freely traded and all values are priced in dollars, and a society that believes in `fundamental values', as in fundamentalist religion. His main point is `reflexivity', that in social phenomena what we think about affects what happens, on the one hand because we can make wishes come true by acting on them (a problem of self-reference), and on the other because we can never foresee all the consequences of our actions (incomplete foresight). This is not the case in natural science, where thinking about the orbit of a planet cannot affect that orbit (unless we would then fire a large enough nuclear rocket to shift the planet's orbit). Soros as trader is always sceptical, because he knows that there is always a gap between reality and his present perception of reality, that no one can be in possession of the absolute truth. This awareness emphasizes the danger posed by `Fundamentalism' or `Fundamental Values' of all brands, if one labors under the dangerous illusion that those values represent inviolable truth. Likewise, transactional society (money-based society) is unstable, chaotic, for lack of any values other than `price'. His idea of an `Open Society' lies somewhere in the no man's land between those two extremes, and is based on the recognition of human fallibility, on the fact that no one is ever in possession of the ultimate socio-economic-religious truth, nor can anyone ever be.<br /><br />Soros was strongly influenced by Popper in his early years and gives much weight to falsifiability, which he thinks is limited in the social sphere to finding out eventually that one or more of one's perceptions is wrong, and why.  But he is optimistic that, via scepticism, we can iterate toward (non time-invariant!) social truth, even if we cannot ultimately reach it. E.g., a financial hypothesis doesn't have to be true to be profitable, but if one doesn't realize that the hypothesis is flawed and get out of the market fast enough, then one will get burned. Soros calls such gaps between perception and reality `fertile fallacies'. Osborne-Black-Scholes was a fertile fallacy until 1987, after which point options traders said it was wrong. The market model that is correct in our era is another fertile fallacy. The assumption from 1990-2000 that the market would only go up was a fertile fallacy, a much more profitable one than a mathematical market model! Believers in 'fundamental market values' held onto an impotent fallacy in the era 1990-2000.<br /><br />Soros says that the events in which we participate do not constitute some sort of independent criterion (as in hard science) by which the truth or falsehood of our thoughts can be judged. By this, he means that there is always a gap between reality and how we perceive reality. However, he is not entirely right that Popperian falsification is beyond the pale: if `reflexivity' is correct, and if we could mathematize that idea as an agent-based trading model, then we could test reflexivity on historic finance statistics. Why do that? Because if reflexivity is correct, then it must have produced those statistics. This mightn't bring us a whit closer to predicting the future, and surely would not, but at least Soros' idea can perhaps be tested, it may be falsifiable after all.<br /><br />Now for the many mistakes in the text. Neither chaos theory nor 'evolutionary models' have anything to do with exploring phenomena that cannot be determined by timeless laws (pg. 12). Newtonian mechanics is full of chaotic examples, and `evolutionary models' (`complex adaptable systems') have so far explained absolutely nothing about biology. Logical positivism and Deconstruction/Postmodernism are certainly not the only worldviews available! Wigner (1967) has explained implicitly the difference between the hard and social sciences in his essays \\"Symmetries and Reflections\\". A model needn't be a timelessly-valid law of motion (like Newton's Laws) to be falsifiable (pg.30), it need (like the Gunaratne-McCauley finance market model) only be empirically correct over a large enough time interval. Our model is correct over the last fifteen years, e.g., and is falsifiable. The following errors occur on pg. 36: pendula are not `ergodic', movement toward `equilibrium' occurs in no known real market, Osborne (1973) gave the correct definition of observable demand-supply curves, they are noninvertible step-functions where, e.g., x=D(p,t) exists  but p=f(x,t) never exists. Stock market limit orders provide the canonical example. Pg. 39: equilibrium is not a special case of reflexivity, equilibrium does not exist in markets, which are both far from equilibrium and complex. Sunspot experiments did not establish General Relativity. On pg. 42  Soros disparages Black-Scholes, which was a good zeroth order model and was falsifiable, and gives credence the economists' impotent notion of `equilibrium', which is not only falsified by real markets but was never even approximately true of any known market. Soros is not close to finance theorists (no disadvantage in making money in the markt) but is apparently close to two or more NYU economists, and is still too much influenced by the `equilibrium' ideas taught in standard economics textbooks. \\"Dynamic disequilibrium\\" should read simply \\"disequilibrium\\", there being no such thing as `static disequilibrium' (another term that he misuses elsewhere). A good dose of Newtonian physics, or at least a basic course in dynamical systems earlier at the London School of Economics might have prevented such misconceptions. \\"Value\\" is discussed on pg. 43, but we have shown in our recent work that there is no time-invariant definition of the (fundamental) `value' of an asset, there is only the most probable or `consensus' value attributed by most traders at a given time. Consensus value fluctuates much more wildly than the market statistics that are distributed about it. On pg. 49 Soros gives a wrong definition of equilibrium, analogous to one that Black apparently had in mind in his paper \\"Noise\\". Pg. 55, market statistics have nothing to do with fractals, but are described to zeroth order by nonGaussian (nonlognornal, non everything you've read if you haven't yet read Gunaratne and McCauley) `Brownian motion' still with Hurst exponent H=1/2, in agreement withthe efficient market hypothesis, which simply means that the market is hard to beat (the market shows no systematic patterns, to zeroth order). Pg. 59, no known market phenomena are susceptible to `equilibrium analysis'. Pg. 62, `static disequilibrium' should be replaced by `closed system with small fluctuations', maybe equilibrium, maybe far from equilibrium. Indeed, the only known way to reach statistical equilibrium in an otherwise free market is to impose upper and lower price controls (see \\"Dynamics of Markets\\" by JMC). By 'dynamic disequilibrium' Soros sometimes means far from equilibrium markets with volatility and fat tails (normal liquid markets), and sometimes he means market crashes. Market bubbles fall into the former category of a normal liquid market. On pg.66, another wrong definition of `equilibrium' is given. There, Soros only means the gap between appearances and (the unknown) reality of the market that will make itself better known in the future. Pg. 67, the claim about near and far from equilibrium for water is physically completely wrong. Pg. 70, there is no evidence that 'open society represents near equilibrium conditions', we certainly know nothing of the sort. On pg. 90 is discussed valuing everything via money, and Spengler's \\"Untergang des Abendlandes\\" could (and should) have been acknowledged.<br /><br />In general, I'm in strong agreement with this book and recommend it very highly, not only to laymen but especially to economists and econophysicists, many (if not most) of whom have bad misconceptions about real markets. In particular, there is the myth of stationary markets, or asymptotic `market equilibrium' in the face of nothing but market instability. Market instability is shown by our model, which is inferred from hard, empirical data. I would like to have been invited to correct the wrong definitions and misleading terminology in the book before it went into print, but apparently that task was given to Economics Professor Roman Frydman at NYU.

I thought he'd failed miserably, was too much like expecting a good hitter to explain how he connects with the baseball. Easier to do than explain. In finance, that is surely even more true, and is in line with von Neumann's naive definition of complexity: a simple system is easier to describe mathematically than to build: the solar system (even if chaotic), a rocket, and so on. A complex system is easier to build/produce than to explain mathematically: the genetic code, or an egg, e.g.<br /><br />Having heard Sheri Markose (Uni Essex) talk recently in Galway about the Red Queen and the Liar Strategy (Cretan Liar, G&ouml;del et al), I became much more curious and now expect that Soros might really have something to tell us but we have to figure out what it is. Two of his main ideas are easy to agree with: expect surprises (the essence of complexity), and we can create self-fullfilling prophecies. The interesting question is whether there's anything there about markets that can be mathematized (Sheri produced formalism, but we still need an example). In any case, the book of Soros to read is \\"The Crisis of Global Capitalism\\". Therein, he writes in more detail what he thinks. A third main point (about markets or any social phenomena), his big point: our perception of social reality is always wrong, time will show the flaws in any model, but there are good models (models that are locally correct) and bad ones. My work (\\"Dynamics of Markets\\") teaches that the good local models (\\"models\\") are empirically based: they describe what markets have been doing, but don't include the surprises, the future. Global predictions are always wrong. Dictatorially enforced models like communism, and extremist free market models like globalization via deregulation are good examples of self fullfilling prophecies. A fourth point, also Soros' main point: because our understanding is always imperfect, reality will always produce something (a surprise) that our model doesn't predict. With deregulation, the most recent surprise for American Christian Fundamentalists may be the systematic bankrupting of the US by the neo-con regime that they've elected and support without question.Why? Because they expect that both they and G.W. Bush will spend an eternity together in heaven. The Fundies will have first to become unemployed to see their mistake. With an island mentality, most Americans don't even know, e.g., that whereas gas prices in the US have more than doubled in three years, they've barely changed in Europe. They rise in gas prices in the US is due soley to the systematic devaluation of the dollar by Bush, a fact that both Soros and Buffet have profited from by betting against the dollar.perfect, reality will always produce something (a surprise) that our model doesn't predict.

Game theory, since the 1980's, has become a large part of economic theory, but is largely restricted to studies of Nash equilibria, which (by Nash's own design) is a neo-classical idea. Economic systems are instead complex, not amenable to any imaginable equilibrium analysis. As Per Bak said, equilibrium is a dead system, like a glass of water at rest. Challet, Marsili, and Zhang are three leading researchers in economics, and are the experts on the Minority Game.<br /><br />This book begins with a very nice introduction to the main ideas and then includes a compilation of the main papers in the field by the Fribourg Group, who are leaders in the new and growing field of econophysics, and other main players. Physicists will enjoy seeing the tools of statistical mechanics in action in an economic setting, and economists will be encouraged to think outside their equilibrium straightjacket by studying the book. But the full range of topics is covered, Nash equilibria as well as cooperation. the compilation also includes some very nice contributions to finance theory and market efficiency.	2005-03-17

But for Thesiger, no challenge was too great, it seems. He was apparently a very fast and sure footed hiker. On the other hand, he didn't have to carry a 20 kilo backpack either.

The book has also proved very useful to me in life. As a graduate student I used Poincar&eacute;'s implicit `advice' (described in the book) in the following way. In electrodynamics we had a long problem sheet to hand in every two weeks. I started by writing down answers to all problems that I knew. Then, I thought about the next-easiest problem each day walking twice to and from the University (about 1 1/2 hours altogether). When the answer came I wrote it down and iterated the process. Before the end of two weeks most of the problems (from Jackson) had been solved. Poincari's advice is very good about giving the unconscious a chance to work. Phooey and double phooey on the silly, uncreative skinner-box types and other behaviorists who don't recognize the unconscious as the source of creativity!	2005-03-03

As I tell Europeans, politically influential  secularist intellectuals likeThomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were rare exceptions in our history:  politically and intellectually seen, America is not an enlightenment land, America is a reformation land, still dominated by the 16th century mentality of fundamentalist religion. So Wills hit the nail right on the head as early as 1988. See also my review of George Lakoff's 'Moral Politics', which attempts to clarify the secular-religious split in America.<br /><br />The book is not flawless. Wills gets it completely wrong on Snow's two cultures: that's not about ivory towered academics alone, most of the world has no idea or completely wrong ideas about science. Wills seems to think that Alan Bloom's idea that feminism is 'not natural' should carry some weight. Wrong, no scientific basis for that at all. Says Dukakis was the first 'modern' presidential candidate. Wrong again. Thomas Jefferson was a nonChristian deist who understood Newtonian mechanics, and was mainly formed by enlightenment ideas. Maybe Jefferson was the first and last U.S. President or presidential candidate, aside from jimmy Carter, to have studied and understood physics. Also, 'post Newtonian science' has in no way abandoned 'measurement': consider quantum physics and cell biology, among many examples! Evolution via mutations is observable/measureable at the molecular level, as the mutation of bacteria and viruses to new and unforeseen forms illustrates. See Robert Weinberg's \\"One Renegade Cell: How Cancer Begins\\" for a describtion of the evolution of a single rapidly replicating cell into a full blown metastacizing tumor via 5-6 mutations.<br /><br />Wills alludes to neo-cons like Bloom and Podhoretz without pointing out that they're neo-cons. Maybe we can forgive him for that omission: that was before the neo-cons, on the backs of the Christian fundamentalists, got the power to create the Iraq war out of a few big lies about WMD.

Science, as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton taught us in the seventeenth century, is the discovery of mathematical laws obeyed by nature. Those laws can only be discovered and then verified or challenged via systematic, repeatable experiments and observations, and to be 'believable' by the scientific community at large those claims must be verified by competent skeptics. Mendel's discovery of simple laws of evolution obeyed by garden variety peas falls into this category. Mendel's scientific discovery was the first step in our understanding of cell biology.<br /><br />There can be no 'proof' (or 'disproof') of Darwinism at the macroscopic size scale. ''Macroscopic' here means phenomena with sizes on the order of centimeters or greater, roughly speaking. This was explained by the great physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (who discovered quantum mechanics in 1925 parallel to Heisenberg) in his pathfinding 1944 monograph \\"What is Life?\\". In that book, Schr&ouml;dinger reviewed all that was known about cell biology up through 1944, and then suggested the idea of the existence of a 'genetic script' in chromosomes (long linear molecules, roughly speaking). Schr&ouml;dinger's speculation motivated Crick and Watson to discover the helical molecular structure of DNA and thereby also discover the genetic code, the code that explains how evolution proceeds at the molecular scale mutation via mutation. We can never hope to understand quantitatively how a fish evolved into a bird, but we have daily evidence of 'Darwinian evolution' in cell biology, e.g., in the rapid mutations of viruses and bacteria to new and unforeseen forms that current antibiotics and vaccines cannot defeat. This is 'complexity' at work, and the essence of complexity is surprises. For a very readable description of the 5-6 mutations required for a cell to evolve into a matastacizing tumor, see Robert Weinberg's \\"One Renegade Cell: How Cancer  Begins\\". It is cell biology, the 'reductionist science' based on Mendel's physically careful oberservations of evolution at work in the mundane growth of peas, that formed the basis for all later scientific work that has led to the amazing scientific breakthroughs that permit cancer treatment.<br /><br />In a word. 'creation science' is not science in any sense of the word, but 'evolution' is science. A scientific model or theory must be falsifiable, meaning that it must be possible to prove it wrong, if it is wrong, via repeatable identical experiments or observations made by competent skeptics (a first requirement for a 'competent skeptic' is that she has adequate scientific training to carry out the required experiments or observations). Until 'creation science' can produce falsifiable claims, it is not science, it is mere ideology. Evolution, on the other hand is falsifiable: we see it at work daily in the effects of mutations.<br /><br />As for the notion of 'intelligent design', it is not needed. We understand from physics how the universe evolved into galaxies from the rapid expansion of a 'hot' gas of fundamental particles. We understand from physics how the solar system formed via condensation. We understand how life evolves via DNA. There is no need, at any point, to assume that God (if she exists, whatever 'God' might mean) intervenes at all. The notion of intervention by a god is not a falsifiable idea, is not science. One can legitimately and intelligently express lack of understanding about the details of how life evolved initially from the formation of complex molecules like RNA and DNA (scientists certainly do), but religious fundamentalism can only thrive in a society that is scientifically ignorant.<br /><br />What was there before the Big Bang? Where did the initial energy come from? Very interesting questions, but we don't know and can't find out. We don't even know if those questions make any sense. There is quite a lot that we don't understand, and with good reason. Science doesn't answer all questions, it only answers falsifiable claims. And hard questions can't simply be answered 'on demand' but require years of smart, dedicated effort, the hardest questions will not be answered in our lifetime or in many lifetimes. We do not yet understand the details of fluid turbulence very well, e.g, and turbulence is not a complex phenomenon. You can believe what you want about religion, but unless your claims can be tested then don't try to pass them off as 'science'. One thing is certain: where science may leave gaps in the description of complicated details of the evolution of the universe and life, religion or other ideology cannot provide us with any competent or reliable answers.can't simply be answered 'on demand' but require years of smart, dedicated effort, the hardest questions will not be answered in our lifetime or in many lifetimes.

Recent work in econophysics has driven the last nails into the coffin of neo-classical thought, but the inhabitants of 'the citadel' have not yet realized that their mathematized ideology is dead and about to be buried. As Alan Kirman quoted in one of his papers, \\"No amount of attention to the walls will prevent the citadal from being empty.\\"<br /><br />One can say that two main schools of thought have evolved as alternatives to neo-classical thinking: econophysics, based on empirical modelling, and computable economics, based on the requirement of computable models. The second school of thought is strongest in Italy. E.g., there are schools of alternative economic thought in Pisa,Trento, Firenze, Sienna, Ancona, and Salerno. Professor Velupillai, now in Galway, taught earlier in Trento and is a well-known advocate for the idea of comnputable economic modelling.<br /><br />Velupillai's monograph begins with a sketch of the contributions of Alain Lewis (who did computable analysis, following Radner's key 1969 paper on equilibrium under uncertainty) and points out that there is no reason to prefer set theoretic models over computable ones. Leaving the question of stability aside, the next question is whether equilibrum is recursively defined, is algorithmically calculable. The latter is the main point emphasized and discussed by Velupillai. Leading neo-classical theorists like Arrow have mightily resisted the imposition of computability restrictions on their modelling. In other words, complexity was ruled out of consideration out of hand. Even if equilibrium would 'exist' mathematically in a given model and would be stable, neo-classical thinking takes for granted that the brain could perform the calculations that would be required in order for agents cooperatively to locate equilibrium. In general, such an assumption places impossible information acquisition and processing demands on agents, and indeed there exists no empirical evidence whatsoever for 'market clearing' in any known market!<br /><br />Velupillai, who is apparently very well-read in the history and philosophy of economic thinking, attributes the first considerations of complexity in economic thought to Simon, Scarf, Menger (the author of the famous traveling salesman problem), and others. Hayek, who worried about 'socialist calculation' but did no quantatitive work, is also brought into the picture. Simon's program is outlined for the readership in detail.<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"Computable Rationality\\", begins with Witgenstein's quote: 'Turing's \\"Machines\\". These machines are humans who calculate.' Indeed, Turing's original idea (outlined for the reader in the Appendix) is based on the idea of typing symbols onto an arbitrarily long strand of paper. Turing began implicitly mechanically with what the brain can do, in contrast with neo-classical modelling.<br /><br />In Chapter 4 we are introduced to the latest thinking about dynamics and computability through a model suggested by Cris Moore. As Velupillai points out in the text, Moore (in the early ninties) gave examples of simple one and two dimensional iterated maps that are equivalent to Turing machines. This was an enormous breakthrough in dynamical systems theory that goes far beyond Feigenbaum's discovery of the universal period doubling sequence to chaos, but is hardly known in physics and mathematics, let alone in economics. In my opinion, it is a great credit to Velupillai that he makes the reader aware of Moore's pioneering work on the origins of complexity in deterministic dynamics, especially the stark difference between chaos and complexity.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is the ninth, where I learned for the first time about an integral equation with computable kernel and initial condition where the solution is not computable. The trick (shown in Aberth and Pour-El & Richards) is that the Lipshitz condition must be violated: nonuniqueness and branching of solutions are required for the noncomputability of the solution.<br /><br />While in complete agreement with the criticism of standard economic theory given in the book, my main point of departure is that economic models should be firmly empirically based. I would expect that empirically based models will be computable, or at least decimally approximable. Because of this difference in emphasis, I disagree with some a few specific proposals made in the text. Multiple equilibria are discussed as alternative to single equilibria, but evidence for equilibria of any sort has not yet been found empirically (and there is enormous confusion over 'equilibrium' in economics and finance texts and papers). Velupillai argues that models should be nonlinear, but he assumes deterministic dynamics. Financial markets are instead stochastic, and are described very well empirically via linear stochastic models (leaving out complexity). It remains to be seen whether business cycle data are strong enough to permit the deduction of a reliable model, analogous to the success of modelling financial markets. In fact, success analogous to empirically-based finance market modelling should be the main aim of economic theory.<br /><br />In closing, I strongly recommend this short, entertaining monograph to the mathematically prepared reader as strong antidote to the terribly misleading standard econ texts by 'leading authors' like Varian, Samuelson, Mankiw and Barro.and Pour-El & Richards) is that the Lipshitz condition must be violated: nonuniqueness and branching of solutions are required for the noncomputability of the solution. <br /> <br />While in complete agreement with the criticism of standard economic theory given in the book, my main point of departure is that economic models should be firmly empirically based.

Here, you can learn about airfoil (hydrofoil) theory in detail, all the way through induction effects (drag and change of angle of inflow). I read it to understand outboard racing propellers. There's is no tractable theory of the latter because of asymmetry, and because racing propellers are surfacing propellers. So you learn what you can from airfoil theory and the rest is engineering via the seat of the pants, try something and then test it to see how it works. I did that for 9 years and set 3 APBA OPC speed records along with winning 6 National Championships, so the method worked pretty well in practice for me but left the most interesting questions about what propellers are doing unanswered.	2005-01-20

Good coverage and photos of tunnels (was recommended to me by a friend who drove tunnels for years) but the book is disappointing in it's OPC coverage: to a first approximation, V-bottoms never existed in the U.S. So please permit me to add something for the record.<br /><br />I was an insatiable fan of outboard racing as a kid in the fifties. My heroes were names from outboard magazines like Randolph Hubbell, Bill Tenney, Billy Schumacher, Hugh Entrop, Billy Seebold, Carl Kiekhaefer, and then later, Paul Allison, who was a genius at making a boat run fast and still turn. In my early teens, the idea of heaven coincided with the magic names of faraway Oshkosh, Fond du Lac, Beaver Dam, and Cedarburg that were written on the cartons that were delived to my parents' multi-faceted business in Kentucky. I finally got to race as a teenager in 1959-60, on many different lakes from Knoxville to Nashville, and then had to put racing out of my mind for 16 years in order to study and get an academic position. While in grad school in New Haven, I attended the NY Boat show once (the OMC Wankel was exhibited on one of Jimbo McConnel's tunnels) and couldn't recover from it for days. Then, finally, from 1977-85, I raced Allison-Craft boats in OPC EP, GP, JP, and ModVP classes in APBA, and also in the NOA 40-70V class. As Freud wrote, happiness is the fulfillment of childhood dreams. In my case, it was certainly true. I raced as if it were my profession and did academic research on the side.<br /><br />'Pleasure Craft Racing' began with N.O.A. in and around Knoxville, Tenn., in the fifties. By 1958 Paul Allison had built flat bottomed glass-covered wooden boats with two strakes (for lift) that were real racing boats. They were too fast for mass production boats like Crosby, Crestliner, and Aristo-Craft, and in 1960 Paul's 'pleasure craft boats' broke all the N.O.A. straightaway records (I set 5 records with his boats, Paul set 1, he and my father and I were the first to break 60 mph in Unlimited Class) but were disqualified 'after the fact', so the records never appeared in the books (my Dad and I didn't go to the annual NOA meeting that year, so it was a shock for us to see the yearbook afterward!). Fighting instead of quiting, in 1961 Paul made a mold (starting with a Rose Boat, also made in Knoxville and an earlier unlimited record setter with a modified Scott 60) and built production boats that really caused OPC racing (the APBA phrase) to take off: he built fiberglass boats that rolled up on the side and turned like a dream, and ran 50 mph in closed course with a Mercury 50, the first production outboard with exhaust tuning. His next step was the development of the V-bottom with pad, a design that was only surpassed in OPC racing by the tunnel. In EP Class in 1981, using my stock 50 cu. in. 75 Evinrude made in 1975, I set the record with one of his son's boats at 70.560 mph and it was never broken (later model OMC 75's wouldn't perform on a V-bottom due to gear case drag and heavier pistons). V-bottom racing peaked with Mod-VP, and was set on a downhill course when, at Lake Havasu in Nov. 1981, nonstock water pickups were allowed. This permitted the previously nondominating Mod-V tunnels to run over 100 mph by getting the gearcase out of the water (I drove a Laser V-bottom that year, and clearly remember how one of the Mod-V tunnels repeatedly 'landed' on the water just before entering the south turn on the course!). The V-bottoms could not break 90 mph and still turn, although one of Darris Allison's V-bottoms still holds the NOA Unlimited V straightaway record at 124+ mph. Roark Summerford, previously unsuccessful in OPC, had taken V-bottom design to a new high with his new Laser hull in 1980 by building an more or less vertical 'strake' on the outer edge of the chine that tunneled water to get the boat out of the hole and out of a turn fast, and then tunneled enough air to lift the tail and make the boat faster on the straightaway. I borrowed Roark's trick and used it on my EP Class Allisons. Against common sense (often violated in hydrodynamics), the 13' Allison with slightly wider than stock pad also turned much tighter and more stably, and was capable of breaking my old straightaway record but I never again had the chance to run for it.<br /><br />In the seventies, after he'd turned the business over to his son Darris, Paul would sit on the bank or in a boat whenever we needed him, watch how the water left the strakes, and then make a suggestion what to do to straighten it out when a boat performed wrong. He was a real seat of the pants engineer, and a very fine artist as well: no boat ever built was as pretty as an Allison, in my eyes. He was also sharp-tongued and had a fine sense of humor in those days. In 1979, when (with Darris, Louis Collins, and Jay Cox) we had to oscillate between a motel and a Big Boy restaurant in Oshkosh for three days waiting for the weather to break so that the time trials could take place, he exclaimed with a slight grin \\"When I die I hope I don't go north of the  Ohio River!\\" the weather didn't break, we had to wait until 1981 to break the records, and Paul is still south of the Ohio river.<br /><br />Here's an anecdote from Paul, who was a Scott-Atwater (and briefly Johnson) fan in the late fifties until Mercury produced the Merc 800 with sportsmaster gearcase (that was how we broke 60 mph with flat bottom boats). Sometime in Florida around 1957 or thereabout Paul was cupping a prop on the edge of a bumper (that's what steel bumpers were good for). Carl Kiekhaefer walked by and asked Paul what he was doing. In 1958, we learned from Mercury about cupping props. In the late seventies, thanks to Louis Baumann for letting me use his prop shop in Houston for two years (an old tractor gearcase made by his father was always resting against a wall), I accidentally learned something that aerodynamics engineers understand but that outboard prop designers apparently never did: the role of camber in improving thrust/drag. I later guessed that I had set the leading edge approximately to match the inflow, which itself is affected by the drag (induction effect). This allowed the for the reshaping of a cleaver that would come off the bank and out of a turn as if in 'low gear', yet still could set a straightaway record. I ran closed course races with the same prop that set the 70.560 mph EP record (with beneath the gearcase water pickup and with the gearcase completely out of the water as on a tunnel, a friend used a similar but lighter Allison XR 14 to set the NOA 40-70V record at over 80 mph the same year). All of my propellers were similar to that one. No one was able copy it because no one knew what I did (most boat racers usually haven't studied physics and don't experiment systematically as much as I did, keeping written records of everything tried). When the camber is right, very little cup is needed, and too much cup increases the prop drag anyway. For those with enough math, see 'Marine Hydrodynamics' by J. N. Newman for the explanation of lift and induced drag. The thrust on a prop blade is like the lift on an airfoil and is generated by the same physical effect: to a first approximation, a wing or hydrofoil (prop blade) is a vortex line (cupping a prop is like dropping the flap on an airplane wing). It's the circulation around the foil/blade that produces the thrust and also changes the angle of inflow to the leading edge.<br /><br />The year 2005 marks the 50th anniversary of the Allison-Craft Boat Co., begun in a garage in Alcoa, Tenn. by Paul with the help of his coworker Harold, and also Paul Allison's 80th birthday.rick and used it on my EP Class Allisons.

As Bush and his neo-cons were telling their lies about WMD in Iraq to propagandize the nation and lead it toward an unnecessary and even detrimental war against a country that neither attacked us nor was a threat to us, I tried an experiment. I was on a list of highschool classmates and had started receiving rightwing email broadcasted by several of them. It seemed that one of them had become neo-con but most had gone over to the religious right (I grew up in eastern Kentucky, part of the Bible Belt). My experiment was to concentrate on three of my former classmates and try to shake their confidence in their illusions via reason. The experiment failed. I tried the same experiment on a close friend, a very Catholic and very intelligent mathematician married to a very Catholic philosopher. Over the years, this friend had used the word 'liberal' disparagingly in our presence several times. Again, the experiment failed. Lakoff's book discusses why my uncontrolled experiments, performed on two entirely different socio-intellectual classes, failed miserably.<br /><br />\\"Conservatives have understood very well that their goals are not just political and economic. Conservatives want to change American culture itself. They want to change the idea of what counts as a good person and what the world should be like .... .\\"<br /><br />\\"Moral Politics\\", pg. 222<br /><br />In negative reaction to civil rights gains by Blacks and women, and also in reaction to the Vietnam War protests, conservatives over the last forty years have organized themselves extremely well (starting with the creation of 'Christian schools' in the south) and have managed systematically and successfully to define what's important in American politics. According to Lakoff's book, this organization begins in the homes, symbolized by the nurturing methods Dr. Spock vs. the striving for obedience by James Dobson in child rearing.<br /><br />The battle between liberal and conservative sides is portrayed by Lakoff as belief in 'innocence of young children' (leading to nurturing) vs. belief in  'original sin' (leading to corporal punishment).Lakoff's main point is that rightwing conservatives believe implicity in the notion of a strict patriarchy held in place by threats and punishment. E.g., rightwing ideologues like Dobson teach adherence to a strict patriarchial hierarchy, so that feedback and error correction (certainly necessary for biological survival at the DNA and cellular leval) are completely eliminated. The hierarchy with lack of error correction explains why Bush, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Cheney were able lead the nation into war by lying about 'WMD' in 2003. Lakoff emphassizes that self-righteous people listen only to themselves and judge themselves by their own set of 'moral standards'. This is why Europe was and still is impotent in trying to chllenge the words about (nonexistent!) WMD coming out of Washington.<br /><br />Lakoff points out that the strict patriarch punishes his kids for disobedience, just as Bush the Partiarch punished Sadam Hussein for disobedience. For neo-conservatives, also discussed in the book, the rest of the world consists of disobedient children who must be taught a lesson by their Father in Washington. As a link, the very popular 1987 book \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\" was written by an neo-conservative, Alan Bloom. Bloom was a particularly successful with his readership because he hid his ideology so successfully, he never made clear exactly what was his proposed program (I read and reread the book seven times trying to find out). His program, the neo-con program for America and the world, was put into effect by other neo-cons like Wolfowitz, who was Bloom's student. Bloom's connection with the notion of strict patriarchy is illustrated implicitly in his advice from Plato: censor books and music for the young so that they'll grow up to be obedient, not rebellious. Only an obedient child will willingly die for an arbitrary leader in an arbitrary war like the war in Iraq.<br /><br />Lakoff discusses why the strict patriarchial hierarchy leads easily into free market extremism (eliminate all government programs, deregulate everything, including schools) and helps explain to liberals why, since Reagan, American conservatives have systematically adopted the policy of trying to bankrupt the U.S. government. Lakoff emphasizes the Calvinistic fear (now propagated by conservative Southern Baptist leaders) that financial success on earth signals approval by God, so that the wealthy, not the poor, are the favored ones, the 'elect' who are headed for heavenly reward.<br /><br />On page 94, 'moral self interest' and Adam Smith's 'Invisible Hand' are connected, showing why conservatives in the U.S.  have opted for free market extremism: deregulation and the abandonment of all government programs (excepting military ones). From the standpoint of the moral absolutism of the strict patriarchy, anything that smacks even slightly of socialism is seen by patriarchial conservatives as 'immoral'. That position is not empirically justified. In my new book \\"Dynamics of Markets\\" the myth of 'The Invisible Hand' (stability and equilibrium of free markets) is exploded empirically (financial markets are shown to be unstable and far from equilbrium, there is no 'Invisible Hand' in financial markets).<br /><br />On page 113 Lakoff answers the question posed by Michael Moore in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\": why is American Society so violent? Lakoff traces the problem back to the peculiarity of the strict patriarchial model adopted by American conservatives, bringing in the element of Calvinism vs error correcting feedback. This explains why Canadians, who are also 'gun nuts', don't kill each other. Canada is a relatively socialistic country, more like the U.S. was BRTF (before Reagan-Thatcher-Friedman). Norwegians and Swiss also have guns at home, but don't kill each other.<br /><br />Chapter 21, one of most interesting chapters, discusses the ideas of leading advocates of different methods of child rearing. The teachings of the very influential rightwinger James Dobson and other more extreme Fundamentalist Christians are presented. Their message: punish kids into obedience, by beating, if necessary. But consider Scandinavia as a counterexample. Scandinavia is a relatively crime free society, with little murder of Scandinavians by Scandinavians. Women are typically brought up as feminists (anathama to Dobson). In Scandinavia, a parent can go to jail for hitting a child, 'unwed mothers' are treated no differently than are other mothers, and I can tell you from years of personal experience that one can walk anywhere in Oslo at midnight or any other time without fear of attack. The spirit of freedom and democracy seems highest in Scandinavia, where people are active and healthy, and where there is universal health coverage and (because of governmental redistribution of money) no poverty.<br /><br />The strict patriarchial hierarchy is misidentified (with no empirical evidence whatsover from biology) by conservatives as 'the natural order'. Extremist interpretations of the Bible and Koran are advocated by conservatives of different stripes worldwide, in spite of massive nonuniqueness in the face of infinitely many different possible interpretations. This is, in fact, why strict patriarchy is demanded by Fundamentalists in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: educated and informed people who think for themselves will not obey any self-declared authority, especially not one who claims that he has a direct pipeline to God.<br /><br />Now for some negative comments about the book. Lakoff repeats his main ideas far too often, maybe with the notion that the reader has to see hear the idea more than once in order to grasp it. I make the same mistake in my own writing, according to my wife, but this repetition makes the book less interestingthat it would have been had it been properly edited. Second, there is absolutely is no evidence presented in the text that 'methods of cognitive psychology' (whatever they are) or any empirical method at all were used to arrive at the ideas presented in the text.

The advice of the book is aimed at producing obedient rather than critically questioning people. One can say that we have here Dobson as conservative antidote to Dr. Spock. Now for the downside of Dobson's ideology.<br /><br />I've lived and lectured extensively in Europe, have visited and lectured in Asia, Central  and South America, and have realized that too many Americans suffer from an abysmal ignorance of the rest of the world. In contrast with the Christian fundamentalist patriarchial program (shared, by the way, by Islamic Fundamentalists as well), consider Scandinavia. Scandinavia has the lowest crime rate in the world. There, a parent can go to jail for hitting a child. Words and behavioral example, not beating, produce good people and a good society. Most of the women are feminists and are fantastic mothers, fantastic women. The entire culture is democratic, freedom-loving, basically nonreligious, not very Christian (there is high awareness of the older ways). Unwed mothers and their kids are normal members of the community (unwed fathers automatically pay heavily financially to support their children). The region is socialistic in the sense that no one lives in poverty, everyone has healthcare. People own guns (hunting is popular) but murder is rare.  My main point is that teaching kids to be peaceful and nonviolent produces a society like Scandinavia where the crime rate is low, whereas hitting kids has produced the present American society with one of the highest crime rates in the world. As an aside, dobson can't tolerate independent people like feminists. For dobson, women have only one role: to serve the male head of the family.<br /><br />Dobson's advice aims to produce obedient boys who tow the line and will die for a waring leader whether the leader and the war are right or wrong. Fundamentalist ideology, Islamic, Jewish, and Christian, is producing war in the world, and Dobson's book encourages the obedience required for making war. Dobson hopes to produce rightwing ideologues like himself who hate taxes and social programs. His writings implicitly propagate the Calvinist doctrine (predestination) that the rich are favored by God, otherwise they wouldn't be successful, and the poor are not, otherwise they wouldn't be poor. In other words, Dobson systematically teaches rightwing ideology.

The method of the book is aimed at producing obedient rather than critically questioning people. The basic method proposed is the use of corporal punishment. One can say that we have here Dobson vs. Spock, a conservative reaction to racial integration and anti-war protests of the sixties, activities that motivated the introduction of 'Christian schools' in the south.<br /><br />As an American who's lived and lectured extensively in different European countries, I observe that many Americans suffer from an arrogant ignorance of the rest of the world. In contrast with the fundamentalist patriarchial program (shared by Fundamentalist Muslims as well as Fundamentalist Christians), consider Scandinavia. Scandinavia has the lowest crime rate in the world. There, a parent can go to jail for hitting a child. Words and behavioral example, not beating, produce good people and a good society. The culture is democratic, freedom-loving, basically nonreligious, not very Christian in any formal sense (fortunately, Rome never reigned in Scandinavia). Unwed mothers and their kids are normal members of the community (unwed fathers automatically pay heavily financially to support their children). The region is socialistic in the sense that no one lives in poverty, everyone has healthcare. People own guns (hunting is popular) but murder is rare. One can compare Canada favorably with Scandinavia in several ways. My main point is that teaching kids to be peaceful and nonviolent produces a society like Scandinavia where the crime rate is low, whereas hitting kids has produced the present American society with one of the highest crime rates in the world. Dobson's teachings fly in the face of these facts. My second point is that Fundamentalist Christians in America have more in common with Islamic Fundamentalists than with tolerant, democratic peoples like Europeans. Just ask yourself, with whom is George Bush (Jr. or Sr.) more comfortable: with a democratic leader like Gerhard Schr&ouml;der, or with a dictatorial Saudi prince?<br /><br />Neo-conservatives and Christian Fundamentalists have led us into militant authoritarianism. The consequence is the Iraq War, which was based on lies about WMD. Islamic Fundamentalists die for Jihad believing that, in heaven, they will be rewarded with 75 virgins.

The book is written by one of the geologists and apparently there is no English translation. The family, consisting of a father, two daughters and two brothers lives in two separate cabins and lives from potatoes, pine nuts, and fish. Their region is upstream, hard to reach on foot. They'd once belonged to a larger religious settlement, but split off on their own when the Russians turned the region into a park and started demanding some degree of conformity. The religious split occurred centuries ago and is symbolized by a change in the number of fingers used to cross oneself (the new rules were regarded as devilish by the sect). Anthropologically interesting to Russian linguists was their old dialect (at the time of the book, only one daughter remained living). the photos of the family are fascinating. They could read the Orthodox Bible. One can compare to some degree with other larger religious groups like the Amish and Old Order  Mennonites. Also eye-opening for Americans, who form their own 'island mentality' in intellectual isolation from the rest of the world: the book, written within the Communist era, contains not a whit of ideology.<br /><br />This review is based on the German translation.	2004-12-12

I reread the book recently because of my interest in Caucasian peoples, due to contact with interesting and friendly Chechnyan refugess in Europe, but with whom we cannot speak enough due to having forgotten what little Russian I had learned. For a recent version of people, life and war in the Caucasus, see Aukai Collins' \\"My Jihad\\", and Robert Pelton Jones' \\"The World's Most Dangerous Places\\" (Jones is mentioned in Collins' book). Collins' book sheds light on the tribal appeal of Islam to angry, disenherited people (he was converted to Islam while in prison), and reminds superficially of what we've read about Zarqawi's conversion to Jihad and his early days, although Collins (known as Abu Mujahid in the first Chechnyn war, but not to be confused with a terrorist with the same name) never accepted terrorism while the latter has embraced it fully.	2004-10-17

Written in the context of the life of the women of and near to a relatively modern and tolerant Afghan who loves books, and who survived both the Russians and the Taleban. Accounts of the hospitality and lives of men under Islam are quite sympathetic (see the fantastic books of hiking, mountain climbing, and adventure by Wilfred Thesiger and Eric Newby, and also the more recent one by Jason Elliott), but the lives of women, not told in those books, are lives of repression and servitude.<br /><br />Some have written that Aasne Seierstad is 'ungracious' to her bookseller host, and I agree that she is, but her story is of the women too important not to have been written. On might tend to discount her account for 'lack of understanding' because she's Norwegian, and Scandinavia (thank God!) is the home of male-female equality, of feminism in its best form. However, there is also Siba Shakib's (earlier) parallel account of the misery of Islamic women (\\"Nach Afghanistan kommt Gott nur noch zum Weinen\\"), following the life of a dirt-poor refugee and her growing family, and Shakib is Iranian. I recommend that you read both books and judge for yourself.  Shakib points out that Kabul girls were forced by the Russians either to go to school to learn to read and write, or go to prison,  and that that was effectively an act of long-term liberation for the women. It made them rebellious. The ideal in Afghanistan apparently is that of a servile, uneducated woman who does not question the man. That standard was applied severly by the outrageous pre-medieval fundamentalist rules imposed by the Taleban. One would have to go back to medieval Europe for the phenomenon of profiting from daughters by selling them to old men for marriage. See, e.g., Liv Ullmann's film of Sigrid Unset's \\"Kristin Lavransdatter\\" for a scene of a wailing teenager being carried off on horseback behind a toothless geezer.<br /><br /> A list of the puritanic rules imposed by the Taleban is given in one of Seierstad's chapters.

In any case, the book is extremely well-written and is made more interesting by virtue of the fact that Siba Shakib is Iranian.<br /><br />What stood out most for me in the story of Shirin-Gol: 1. Being forced to go to \\"Russian School\\" to learn to read and write made all the difference for her, made her 'rebellious' and aware that she should demand and have rights. 2. The Mujahedin practice of \\"pulling off the shirt\\" from the waist upward of young Russian soldiers. 3. The sexual misuse of young boys by the Taleban (see also \\"The Kite Runner\\"). 4. The massive illeracy of the populace, including the mullas.<br /><br />This book can and should be read parallel to Aasne Seierstad's \\"Bokhandleren i Kabul\\", which tells an analogous story of repressed and degraded women from the middle-upper class perspective.

This was about the only text available. Ralph Roskies arrived at Yale hot from his degree with Wigner, and after torturting us through a second semester of Jackson's \\"Classical Electrodynamics\\" he taught a course on groups. that was probably the best course I ever took. Hamermesh was pretty sketchy when it came to Lie groups and algebras, so we used the first rate review article by Racah on \\"Group Theory and Spectroscopy\\" instead. Then, in the seventies, Wybourne wrote his \\"Classical Groups for Physicists\\", which was really nice!<br />Throughout Jackson, Roskies (Wigner's student, remember) had kept harping that 'covariance is not a physical principle, a principle of relativistic invariance is a physical principle.' I didn't understand it, but it stuck in my head so that a decade later I did understand it. There, Hamermesh was useful: he defines very clearly the difference between scalars and invariants. So I learned my lesson. Late. Nearly every relativity book repeats some ancient error and writes \\"ds^2 is invariant\\". Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler get it right: ds^2 is a scalar.<br />In addition, Hamermesh discusses ray representations, which are important if you want to understand Weyl's interpretation of the canonical commutation rules in quantum mechanics.	2004-07-02

Anyone who proclaims that reductionism is dead is woefully ignorant of the enormous breakthroughts, by standard 'reductionist' methods, in cell biology, including cancer research. See R. Weinberg's &quot;One Renegade Cell: How Cancer Begins&quot;, as an antidote to the anti-scientific philosophy propagated in this book.<br />First, there are no known laws of  &quot;self-organization&quot;. The only known laws of nature are the laws of physics and consequences deduced from the laws, namely, chemistry and cell biology. Complex adaptable models and other efforts to mathematize Darwinism are so far not falsifiable, hence are not yet science and may never be. Second, no one has yet defined 'emergence' in any meaningful (i.e., falsifiable) way. Worse, every mathematical model that can be written down is a form of 'reductionism', including so-called complex adaptable ones. Let us think clearly and be try to be precise: Quantum theory reduces phenomena to (explains phenomena via) atoms and molecules. All of chemistry is about that. Cell biology attempts to reduce observed phenomena to DNA, proteins, and cells. Believers in self-organized criticality try to reduce the important features of nature to the equivalent of sandpiles via the hope for a not yet found universality principle. Network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links, and also wish for a universality principle. In order to try to isolate cause and effect, there is no escape from reductionism of one form or another. Holism is an empty illusion: holism cannot even be mathematized or falsified. Holism is religion, not science, and should not be advertised as if it would be science.<br />See Schr?dinger's &quot;What is Life&quot; for a clear explanation why we should not expect to discover macroscopic (statistical) laws of biological evolution, the only way to understand evolution being mutation by mutation at the level of DNA. Following Mendel, who was a reductionist in the Galilean spirit of physics, two of those who followed Schr?dinger's line of thought discovered the structure of DNA, and the genetic code. Genes and the genetic code are excellent examples of emergent objects that can be studied systematically.

The description is as seen through the eyes and experiences of a few individuals. Maybe few books have been better written, but the description of torture is hard to read, far worse that that described in &quot;The Kite Runner&quot;. Also important: the old aunt's denial near the end that her brother had commited any wrong. Ah, yes, the denial of wrongs committed, and the worse the crime, the more complete the state of denial.	2004-05-22

He describes random networks, small world and scalefree networks. In nonrandom networks the importance of hubs is emphasized. Small world networks are the ones with a well defined averge number of links, and in scalefree ones the density of links scales as a power law. For the many interesting examples discussed, I would like to have seen graphs showing scaling over at least three decades in order to be convinced of scaling. However, in practice, whether a network scales or not may not be so important. I liked best the discussions of terrorism, AIDS, and biology. If one could locate the hubs, then a small world network could be destroyed, but as the author points out there is no systematic method for locating the hubs. Also, destroyed hubs in a terror network might be replaced rather fast, whereas airline hubs could not be replaced so quickly. The book might be seen as indicating a starting point to try to develop a branch of mathematical sociology. For example, the maintainance of ethnic identity outside the Heimat is discussed in terms of networking. Now for a little criticism.<br />I did not find the discussion of the rich get richer` very helpful because network theory at this stage deals only with static geometry, not with empirically-based dynamics. In fact, the dynamics of financial markets have been described empirically accurately without using any notion of networking. In the text the phrase economic stability&quot; is used but stability is a dynamic idea, and there is no known empirical evidence from the analysis of real markets for any kind of stability. The absence of dynamics on networks means that complexity is not described at all: there is nothing complex about the geometry of a static network! Suggesting that cell biology can be described by networking is empty so long as dynamics are not deduced from empirics. Nonempirical models of dynamics will probably not be of much use for making advances in understanding or treating cancer, e.g. Everything we know about cell biology and cancer was discovered via reductionism, by isolating cause and effect the way that a good auto mechanic does in order to repair a car.<br />Unfortunately, the author lets his enthusiasm get the best of him when he proclaims laws of self-organization&quot; and the need to go beyond reductionism. First, there are no known laws of self-organization&quot;. The only known laws of nature are the laws of physics and consequences deduced from the laws, namely, chemistry and cell biology. Worse, every mathematical model that can be written down is a form of reductionism. Quantum theory reduces phenomena to (explains phenomena via) atoms and molecules. All of chemistry is about that. Cell biology attempts to reduce observed phenomena to DNA, proteins, and cells. Believers in self-organized criticality try to reduce the important features of nature to the equivalent of sandpiles. Network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links. In order to try to isolate cause and effect, there is no escape from reductionism of one form or another, holism being an empty illusion.

So is the difficulty of making contact with Baiba, since both are watched. And the ending: who are the good guys, and who are the bad ones?<br />But Mankell strains the the will to believe too often. Why should Wallender, with a fake Latvian pass, go so far south and then enter the country illegally on foot? Not very likely that Wallender would have survived the massacre and escaped the building, either. Nor can I believe that Wallender could have found his way through the police headquarters, into the archive, and out again so easily. In the end, Mankell gives away a bit too soon who the bad guys really are.<br />One thing is puzzeling. Wallender did not connect with Baiba in the end. So, in later novels, is it only in his imagination that Baiba is his distant girlfriend? Mankell, realistically enough, does not present us with a happy life for the Commissar!<br />This review is based on the German translation \\"Hunde von Riga\\".	2004-04-27

There had been earlier math books, Moser's and Arnol'd's, e.g., but they were too hard for most of us. Like Moser and Arnol'd, Lichtenberg and Lieberman concentrated on Hamiltonian systems. One discovered accidentally, later, that von Neuman and Koopman had also studied chaos in a two-degree of freedom Hamiltonian system in one of their papers on ergodic theory in the thirties. Of course, we were all aware of Poincare's earlier work, although nearly no one had read it. In any case, this book is a time piece. Not really written as a text, it had something for everyone. Even a greenhorn could pick out models like the Fermi accelerator and program them graphically on a VIC 20 in order to impress and inspire the class.	2004-04-16

In the paper on special relativity, the Lorentz transformations are derived via formulating and solving a first order pde, a treatment that no textbook presents (first order pdes aren't taught in math physics, in spite of the fact that every set of first order autonomous odes generates a first order pde). It took my teaching the subject to advanced undergrads in later years to realize what many others have by now noticed, namely, you don't need two postulates for special relativity. &quot;Galilean invariance&quot; is enough. The constancy of the speed of light follows from the requirement that there is no special reference frame.<br />Einstein's presentation of GR is unsurpassed for conciseness and clarity, is a model for other researchers to follow when writing papers. Here, he introduces the famous misconception (corrected today in the better texts like Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler) that general covariance is a physical principle. Well, even the greatest minds make mistakes.<br />Feynman wrote well, but no scientist to date has written better than Einstein.	2004-04-16

But also too easy to miss the main points of the physics/geometry (see Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler) while becoming an expert at manipulating tensors in general coordinate systems. Very nice presentation of parallel transport and Weyl's formulation of gauge transformations. Better, more recent treatments using awareness of Lie algebras show the connection of curvature with noncommuting translations/operators, and emphasize the importance of relativistic invariance and local coordinate systems (physics). Einstein wrote of general covariance as if it would be a physical principle (it isn't), and this confusion wasn't cleared up for a long time.	2004-04-16

I really like this book, largely because the journey takes place on foot through the wildest parts of Afghanistan, describing people, languages villages, scenery, Islam, the heat and insects, weather, the mountains and passes.  It's a voyage of discovery, the only way discovery can be properly made: on foot. Also important, pp. 83-93 provide the reader with a short history of Nuristan.<br />Two English amateurs take a few mountain climbing lessons (learning how to go up, but not how to come down) on a big rock in Wales, then set out via auto for Kabul, nearly being jailed for a car accident along the way. From Kabul, they set out northeast in the Panjshir Valley where they acquire three Tadjiks (including a hefty, surley one) and three horses to carry their two air mattresses and an incredible amount of other equipment, including very tasty old army rations of diverse sorts. They note U.S. and Russian road building in the Panjshir Valley. These roads proved to be extremely useful to the Russians to enter Afghanistan in 1979, and to hightail it out again in 1989. Along the way to Nuristan/Kafiristan, their main goal, they make several attempts on Mir Samir (19880 ft.) and fail honorably. The description of the mountain should be useful to modern climbers wishing to scale it. Crossing the Chamar pass into Nuristan, they finally meet many Kafiris but don't stay long enough in that neck of the woods to tell us enough about the people, mainly because the lead Tadjik regards all Katirs as robbers and murders and had to be tricked into going into Nuristan in the first place. His fear is communicated to the author, who writes with the best form of English humor about their endurances and escapades. So, unfortunately, they rushed through the most interesting part of Afghanistan, exiting via the Rangul Valley. Newby writes of many Tadjiks and Kafiris traveling barefoot through the mountains. In the Alps, we've only seen two (young, female) herders who did that in recent times. The Dari word for alm/alp/seter/monte is Aylaq&quot;, a word that does not exist in English. Newby describes one endearing/irritating habit not understood by at least one recent journalist in Afghanistan: village people always came out and sat around the visitors, watching every move with fascination. In a recent news article, this sort of behavior was reported but then was ignorantly attributed to fascination with American power&quot;. Correlation does not imply cause and effect!<br />One of our adventurous pair speaks Farsi, the other has forgotten Urdu, so they can communicate with the Tadjiks and somehow (??) manage to communicate with the Kafiris, who speak a multitude of dialects of an uralt Indo-Iranian language. Iranian is the lingua-franca of the Afghanistan and Pakistan. We can conclude that calling a Nuristani Kafir&quot;, even before the time of Abdur-Rahman (the Karlus Magnus of Afghanistan), was an insult comparable to calling the ancestors of Hopi Indians Anasazi&quot;. Along the way, our heroes met an old Kafir who could tell them about the old days of wine and terraced hillsides before Islamicization ca. 1890. Madrassas and bad-tempered mullahs also existed in Newby`s time, even in Nuristan.<br />The last words to our anti-heroes in this book, spoken by Wilfred Thesiger, are priceless. They met Thesiger's caravan coming up the valley on their way out of Nuristan. He convinced them to stay another night. Fluent in Arabic, he claimed not to know a word of Persian, and barked orders to his carriers in English, leaving it to the Afghans to find out what he meant best way they could. That reminded me tangentially of Mark Twain's description of his relationship&quot; to German in A Tramp Abroad&quot;.<br />That Newby was, in the beginning, a rank amateur is evidenced by the fact that he had a pair of hiking boots specially made, then did not try them out before getting deep into the Panjshir Valley!<br />I got onto this book via An Unexpected Light&quot;, and recommend both books highly, without any qualification. This book describes some of the Afghan tribes in the 1950`s, so we get a picture of what it was like before the Russian invasion and the resulting religious fanaticisim of the Taliban made the country kaput. One could hope that the west will be smart enough to help the Afghans without trying to convert them to western ways this time around, but the recent record of the U.S. and Great Britain in Iraq does not give such a ridiculous hope much credibility.ected Light&quot;, and recommend both books highly, without any qualification.

The book did not waste time on philosophy or ideology but presented a criticism that was and remains valid. Butterfly Econonomics\\" takes a different tack. I recommend reading at least the first half of The Death of Economics\\" first, followed by this one. One must first know what is the problem before one can appreciate the solution.<br />In the preface, Paul Ormerod apologizes mildly to neo-classical economists and expresses hope that this new book should be easier for them to stomach. He knows, as we all do by now, that that school of thought does not take kindly to criticism. His expressed aim is to concentrate on complex, biological models instead of mechanical ones. In the Introduction, he announces boldly that he will abandon the idea of fixed preferences, an admiriable task! The butterfly` symbolizes not deterministic chaos (the theme of the second half of his first book) but rather the ability of a biological system to interact, adapt and learn. The author`s aim is to understand the two main problems of economics: (1) Why is there economic growth, and (2) why are there business cycles?<br />Complexity as the edge of chaos is alluded to, but the main point of chapter 1 is to introduce the reader to Alan Kirman's ant model, a variation on Brian Arthur's urn model. Here, the emphasis is on modelling the interaction of agents, or agent-based modelling`, and Paul does a fine job of explaining the ant model. One wonders, as one reads the book, why econ texts are not written in such stimulating fashion rather than presenting us with a theory that doesn't work. Neither Kirman nor Ormerod present the ant model as solving any economic problem quantatitively, rather, it is discussed in the spirit of showing what is left out of optimizing behavior`.<br />In chapter 2, Paul explains why we should give up hope of short term prediction, and criticizes the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) for its failure to allow for adequate volatility. I'll come back to this and some other points below. The third and fourth chapters discuss crime and family values in terms of the personal perferences of interacting agents. Again, this stimulates the reader to imagine how one could write an econ text to make it meaningful.<br />Chapter 5 mentions Radner, whose work (along with Kirman`s) every econophysicist should know. Roy Radner is the theorist who drove all the nails in the neo-classical theory coffin back in 1968. He showed that if uncertainty is introduced into the neo-classical equilibrium model then the agents can't locate equilibrium, so that no trades are made. In other words, uncertainty makes the model's economic eficiency plunge from 100% to zero, which is a more realistic model of the Third World (the equilibrium model is not an empirically realistic model of any real market).<br />In the sixth chapter, business cycle forecasting is introduced and (pre-EU) the question is raised whether Italy can meet the fiscal requirements necessary to enter the European monetary union. I read about the way that Long Term Capital Management helped Italy to solve this problem via creative financing` in Dunbar's Inventing Money\\". Chapter 7 discusses the failure of econometrics to extract fixed rules of behavior (machine-like models, if noise-driven) from the data, and begins the discussion of the failure of the standard model (RBC, or real business cycle theory) to explain the data.  Economists are correctly lambasted for ignoring empirical data in discussing the correctness\\" of their models, and Paul's interesting new model of the GNP is presented in chapter 8. I found these chapters to be the most stimulating. There may still be something here for econophysicists to work on.<br />Interactingants (variable preferences), the theme the entire book, are presented explicitly again in chapter 9. We`re informed of the neo-classical idea of a production function`in chapter 11, and economists are again properly taken to task for what I would label as Aristotelian-style philosophic postulations, while roundly ignoring the available empirical data. I find the discussion of the production function to be very useful, because Paul presents it, as he presents everything, in clear, simple language. This saves me the trouble of having to read dense, rambling economics papers to learn about that idea, although another source is Mirowski's More Heat than Light\\".<br />A very interesting thought is mentioned as a footnote on page 168, and I`ll leave it to the reader to ponder that one. In chapter 13, Paul further advises governments against too much regulation, no doubt having in mind his own UK before it was Thatcherized to the opposite limit (the US is presented as a happy counter-example, but since Reagonization we have our own severe unsloved problems). Here, the basis of his recommendation is the impossibility of accurate short-term predictions, something else for econophysicists to think about. It is true that short term prediction is useless in a stochastic system. In a deterministic chaotic or complex system, one sees only regular behavoir at short times (because of local integrability). I guess the point here is that the GNP can be modelled stochastically. But however correct hands off` advice may be in many cases, I would point out that the fixing of the Thai Baht after Thailand`s financial collapse seems to provide a good counterexample to a complete hands-off` policy. Also, the failure of Mexico to fix the Peso and refuse to pay international loans ca. 1997 caused nearly total economic collapse for the then-growing middle class there, who held unpayable floating mortgage loans. So there's a lot of grist here for the econophysical mill. Ending this fine little book, Paul Ormerod emphasizes the ant model as an example of one variant of the overall complex systems approach which (is proposed) in this book\\". That model is claimed to be only an extension of neo-classical economic theory. Now for some comments, which I hope will prove useful.<br />First, I see no reason why neo-classical econmists should take any solace from this book (thank goodness!): the ant model doesn`t rely on utility maximization, and is in not an extension of their model. It doesn't begin by perturbing the neo-classical equilibrium model (as Per Bak did by adding noise in Dynamics of Money\\"), and seems completely unrelated to optimizing behavior. However, the ant model, while interesting and instructive, also is not complex and so references to complexity, or to complexity as living the edge of chaos seem unnecessary. Physicists do not yet agree on a definition of complexity\\", but I like Chris Moore's definition, where surprises at every length scale\\"are the essence of complexity. This rules out scaling and attractors, and food sources in the ant model are analogous to attractors. Here's what Moore means, I think. Chaotic and random\\"/stochastic systems are simple, by this definition, not complex: the statistics of the distant future for specific classes of initial conditions can be known in advance for chaotic or stochastic systems without doing a step by step calculation. For a complex system, in contrast, there are surprises\\" that prevent one from knowing any statistical distribution at long times, for a given initial condition, other than by watching the system unfold step by step. In other words, the system cannot be characterized by any statistical distribution because surprises` all the way to infinite time occur (volatility and fat tails are not examples of surprises`). For my taste, mutations of bacteria and viruses to new forms are the essence of complexity, physically. This kind of complexity is presumably found in markets, but where and how? We don't know how to quantify that stuff.<br />Here's a more serious criticism. The idea of the EMH presented in the text is Shiller's notion, based on dividends discounted infinitely far into the future. This is not a useful definition because it's not falsifiable (Modligliani-Miller even teaches that dividends are irrelevant). The best definition of the EMH, the one used by finance theorists, is represented by the Martingale condition (plus, I would add, with Hurst exponent H=0), which guarantees that there are no patterns in the statistics that can be exploited for unusual profit. Markov proceses fall into this category, and have been used to describe financial market statistics, including option pricing, quite accurately (see my new econophysics book). So the EMH doesn`t rule out either fat tails or nonstationary processes, both of which are required to describe the observed volatility` of financial markets.<br />Finally, the ant model is not really biology` but is instead noise driven mechanics. Why is that? Every mathematical model that can be written down is a mechanical model. As Turing showed, mathematics is a mechanical process, so whatever can be mathematicized classically is classical mechanical, in some sense. Turing's famous typewritter tape is a classical mechanical system. More to the point, financial market statistics are very accurately described by simple noise-driven mechanical` models. The only known way to get away from fixed-machinery models (fixed hardware and fixed software) is to go to a neural net model that can learn from the environment, so that the connections change with time. The neural net may even be deterministic, but interaction with the environment prevents us from knowing the future, even theoretically. Finally, there is a reference to value` in the text. I have described elsewhere why value` is nonunique and therefore is an ill-defined notion.<br />In context, these are pretty minor criticisms, and to answer them properly (excepting the EMH error) one could not write an elementary book. So I think, in the end, that Paul Ormerod has done a fine job of using the ant model to symbolize what's missing in the standard, boring econ texts. Again, reading this book made me think how an econ text could be written to stimulate the reader to think about solving real, empirically-driven econ problems, and if Paul doesn't do take on that arduous task then someone else eventually will. If you want to read less than the entire book, then I strongly recommend chapters 1, 7, 8, and 12.

Elliot has written an unparalleled account of high adventure. This is not a travelogue, it's an account of his travels with Afghan warriors. And his description of them is very informative and sympathetic.<br />The book covers two periods, 1985 in the heat of the fight against the Russians, and 1995 as the Taleban are making their Puritanic onslaught. In the first visit, at age 19, he met a 21 year old Norwegian reserve officer, Pål Refsdal, who was also there to fight (Elliot found that he did not have the stomach for war was guided back to Peshawar over the Khyber Pass after 2 weeks). Refsdal went on to become Norway's most famous war reporter.<br />This is one of the finest travel books available, especially if you love wandering through the mountains and learning about isolated cultures, and even if you don't. As helpful background, Elliot gives us a very interesting short course in Afghan culture and mentality, along with explaining many Dari sentences.<br />There are two irritating things about the book. First, in spite of two maps inside the cover, I was continually running back and forth to a better map of Afghanistan (severe disagreement of various maps with each other is discussed in the book). Second, you have to figure out from the context what the dates are. I finally pinned them down as 1985 and 1995. So you have to do a little homework as you read.<br />I guess that Elliot was brought up on Kipling the way that Americans of an earlier generation were brought up on Hemingway.<br />I know the feeling of freedom from modern society via the backpack and the long mountain trail. The author writes \\"As to 'Islam', we had, after all, only one substantial objection: its lack of decent wine.\\" Let me state a more serious lack. All fundamentalists, Christian, Islamic, or Jewish,  lie mentally not further forward in time than about the fourteenth century, at best (this does not prevent their use of modern weapons and communication). The scientific revolution generally had to overcome Christianity in all its forms in Europe, and led to the end of the witch trials there.  Islam did not participate in the Enlightenment (according to Bernard Lewis in \\"The Middle East\\", western science (or just \\"science\\") was brought into Turkey in the 19th century by a Jew who'd converted to Islam). Where religion dominates, science and  other forms of understanding cannot very easily take root. But on a lighter note, lack of wine is certainly a serious matter (as is lack of the mixed, naked sauna so common in the German-speaking countries but absent in England and elsewhere), so perhaps the journalist Peter Scholl-Latour (\\"Das Schlachtfeld der Zukunft: Zwischen Kaukasus und Pamir\\") put it best: after visiting with various Mudjahedin groups in Afghanistan during 1980-'95, and experiencing Islamic society more generally in the entire region, he saw a middle-aged French woman in a bikini in Kabul's only swimming pool in 1995 and wrote (pg. 348, my translation) that \\"the picture of her harmonious body did more to convince me of the absurdity of the oriental habit of covering women that did all the arguments of western feminists combined.'

It eventually takes us through decades of American history seen from the eyes of workers, factory owners and, finally, globalizing financiers. One learns how the racist governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, inadvertently contributed to integration by attracting northern factories to his state in the Johnson era. We learn that the Mexicans started attracting US factories in the same era, the 1960s. And we get a picture of the rise and fall of the US labor movement, as well as examples of the crimes of the Teamsters. The transition from emphasis on product-quality to 'profits at any cost', the heart and soul of the philosophy of globalization via deregulation, in the age of leveraged buyouts and junk bonds is accurately and concisely described.<br />Lyndon Johnson gave us the Vietnam War, a terrible mistake in US foreign policy. But for those of us who grew up in the south or border states and can tell you what life was like under segregation, Lyndon was a real hero when it came to civil rights enforcement. In my Ky. town in the fifties, before the civil rights Act was passed, the only thing that was integrated was little league baseball. I still remember listening to the daily news from Alabama and Mississippi in the early sixties, beatings, murders, acts that were consistent with a fascist state government, but not a democratic one. Southern states like Mississippi used the same excuse for brutality against blacks, union organizers, and civil rights workers that Hitler and the Nazis used against the Jews and socialists: right wing violence and killing 'protected' society from 'the communist threat'.	2004-03-02

This was the third Mankell mystery I'd read (the other two are &quot;Die falsche F&auml;hrte&quot;, &quot; Brannvegg&quot;, then later &quot;Hunde von Riga&quot;) and it's fully up to par. Hard to say whether Firewall is really better. Here, as in &quot;Firewall&quot; (and as opposed to &quot;Die falsche F&auml;hrte&quot;) the book takes off and flies from the beginning. The suspense builds enormously but there came a point where I doubted, with all the tangled loose threads, if Mankell could bring it to a decent ending (according to John Berger, and maybe Kafka as well, a writer should never have a specific ending in mind, just let it fall out as the writing progresses). Anyway, the book ended reasonably after all. Highly recommendable.

It \\"stayed with me\\" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.<br />Descriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....<br />Because all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.<br />It's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism.	2004-02-27

Was reading during a boring English class, came to the part where blood drips onto the hero's head in an ambulance, and then I passed out temporarily. It got me out of the rest of the English class.<br />I read in a biography that Hemingway wrote so accurately both historically and geographically that some Italian historians believed he'd witnessed the fighting in and above the Isonzo/Soca Valley personally. He didn't, he got no further east than the Piave Valley. The fighting described takes place in the Slovenian Alps, then Austria, east of Tarcento, and very far east of Belluno. In Kobarid, Slovenia, in the valley of the fighting, we visited a small war museum in 1997, maybe the world's most impressive: photos of soldiers with faces half shot off, and other carnage, very effective in curing any foolish notion that war is romantic. Nothing in the book reflects the horror of the war like the displays in this museum, which contain photos of soldiers, emplacements, and fighting far above the treeline in the Alps in the dead of winter. At the entrance of the museum hangs an enormous poster showing Hemingway's face, and you can buy A Farewell to Arms in any of five languages there.<br />The worst fighting of the war between the Austrians and Italians took place in the Isonzo Valley. The book remains one of my favorites, in memory. For a somewhat comical \\"Heimat\\"  film made after the war, showing the fighting between the Austrian Kaiserj&auml;ger and the Italian Alpini at Col d' Lana in the Dolomites, see \\"Berg in Flammen\\" staring the popular mountaineer Luis Trenker. This fighting took place at the same altitude as the war in the Soca Valley, on very steep, high, ice and snow covered rock.

I wrote in recent reviews of Mankell and Leon mysteries that, after reading Sherlock Holmes and Helen McInnes, I had avoided mysteries altogether for many years, too boring. I had forgotten about Alistair McLean. I did read a few of his stories, and liked them, but I didn't read the famous ones and have forgotten exactly which stories I had liked (it was in the seventies, at latest). \\"Puppet on a Chain\\" sounds familiar.<br />I picked up the Norwegian translation (\\"Partisaner\\") of \\"Partisans\\" cheaply in Trondheim in 1985 because I thought it might be easy, but my vocabulary at that time was inadequate for a novel, so I strained over the first 15 pages and then gave up.  I read the first few pages again last night, and was amazed that I had marked a few sentences: in response to why the Scandinavian name \\"Petersen\\" (the name of the hero) is found in Jugoslavia, Petersen responds to the German officer in Rome that that can't be regarded as unusual, that there is, e.g., a village in the Italian Alps where the rest of a Scottish regiment landed in the Middle Ages, and where every second name starts with \\"Mac\\". What's funny is that I forgot that I had read this, but in 1/1988, with my then German girlfriend, we visited that village! It's named Gurro, lies in Val Canobino above Cannobio on Lago Maggiorre. They have a Scottish museum, and many of the men have red hair and faces. I didn't ask about surnames, though, although we returned to the village (an extremely stately mountain village half in ruin in 1988) and hiked in the region in 1995. Much more interesting is that this is a region where the old women still wear local costumes and use the kraxe (a wooden back-rack) for transport in daily life. There is only one hotel in the entire valley, which is not a valley at all but is more of a canyon. PS It's not a good translation, I still have trouble with it.	2004-02-26

The book gives us the real flavor of Brazil, which compensates for the use of magic in the plot. The magic is used to emphasize the racism.  The racism of Brazil differs from that of the U.S.,  Europe, Afghanistan and other middle eastern countries, in that mixing has far more prevalent there, first of the Portugese with the Indians and later with the Africans.<br />In spite of that, the black underclass lives in the most abject, dangerous, poverty imaginable (are the lives of Hazaras in Afghanistan in any way comparable?). I will not forget the view from Impanema Beach of an attractive populated mountainside in the distance. In Europe or the U.S. the rich would now occupy such territory. It was a favela, and the sewage from all favelas runs untreated into the water. You cannot swim in the ocean, so 'normal' people simply promenade and sunbath on the beach, where boys from the favela sell roasted cornears and sodapop, and occaisonally swim, out of ignorance, in the water. Nights in summer without A/C are unbearable, one cannot possibly sleep. So the street along Impanema and Copacabana are alive with walkers, joggers, skaters and prostitutes at 1 AM. The hospitality of the Brazilean people is great, the brutality of their police is seen in the faces of the policemen, and the hopelesness of the favela dwellers is surely without bound.  The houses of the rich and middleclass border right on the favelas, and are separated from them by stone fences with broken glass imbedded on top. Nevertheless, if you walk up the stairway leading into a favela you will see graffitti on the walls of those houses, a sign that broken glass is not enough to keep the poor out (I kept my camera under my shirt to make stealing it harder). And as a white, you will risk your life if you walk further upward. This is what I mean when I write that the book \\"Brazil\\" gives an accurate sense of place.ther upward.

So this book, given to me as a gift, surprised me. Written by a reputable high energy physicist who's taken the trouble to understand details of ideas far afield from his own, the book is a gem, written like a scientific novel. In place of futuristic speculation we're presented with well-established ideas in highly readable form. The chapters on DNA and Cancer alone make the book worth reading. Other recommended, very readable, books providing more detail are \\"One Renegade Cell\\" and \\"Genome\\".<br />An irritation: the author shoots half-heartedly from the hip against reductionism on pp. 10-12. The problem is that there is no falsifiable alternative to reductionism, or the isolation of cause and effect. So-called holism is a vague, not mathematically formulable notion. Holism in biology remains an empty hope. Schr?dinger explained in \\"What is Life\\" why evolution can only be understood at the molecular scale and never at the macroscopic scale. Every mathematical model that succeeds empirically is a form of reductionism. Quantum physics (including all of chemistry) reduces phenomena to atoms and molecules, cell biology reduces phenomena largely to genes and proteins, SOC (self organized criticality) hopes to reduce nature to sand grains and sandpiles, network enthusiasts hope to reduce phenomena to nodes and links (wait until they try to do dynamics empirically correctly...). Economics (beyond finance) so far has failed as scientific theory because it cannot find any suitable \\"invariant units\\" to build a theory on, human preferences having failed to do the job. Computerization and advances in biology (all via reductionism, by the way) do not and cannot change these facts. Let me state this challenge to the author and to other critics of reductionism: present us with something nonreductionist that is empirically correct. Until then, be pleased to restrain yourselves from purely speculative and totally unproductive criticism of science.ticism of science.	2004-02-19

Feynman would have been the writer to provide us with that. We're fortunate to have anything at all of what Feynman thought about the subject, but this book (taken from Feynman's rough lecture notes) does not do the job. E.g., in the first chapter we're presented with a description of RPF's joy in discovery and corresponding philosophy of how to understand anything: don't read about it, just work it out by yourself in umpteen different ways (nothing new about Feynman there!), but the examples provided of how Feynman actullally worked it out can be compared with some of Arnol'd's presentations of how he worked out mechanics problems in his text on Classical Mechanics (state the problem, then state the final result). So we still need a SYSTEMATIC 'written-for physicists' text on computability. Neverthless, we can be grateful to Hey and Allen for putting together these stimulating Feynman fragments for us, especially since they stem from his last days of life as a physicist.<br />By the way, Feynman certainly would not have agreed with S. Weinberg's extreme reductionist philisophy that asserts that once we've understood quantum theory and quarks then we've understood physics/nature, that 'the rest is mere detail'. On the other hand, he surely would have horselaughed the holists who proclaim that reductionism is dead, that physics will become more like 'poetry'. The lie in the latter nonsense is exposed by the entire field of genetics and cell biology, which is where the 'real' complexity in nature is to be found. Every physics student should be required to take a good class in molecular biolgy these days, a subject that's a lot more important and a lot more interesting than string theory (which, as Feynman more or less said, has degenerated into mere philosophy in the absence of experiments to test the ideas) .	2004-02-19

The book starts by proclaiming that neo-classical economics is adequate for explaining the information economy. This claim is not backed up in the book. First, textbook neo-clasical equilibrium theory contains neither money nor 'information'. Second, the book merely discusses qualitatively and nonsystematically ideas like positive feedback and increasing returns that were better presented by Brian Arthur. Third, even asymmetric information is not discussed (Ackerlof and Stiglitz are not even mentioned). Fourth (or zeroth), there is not a single empirical graph in the entire book, and nothing of modern ideas of network theory. So I would say that the book is more or less on the same level as Kelly's (pre-bubble-bust) \\"New Rules for the New Economy\\". All of these books implicitly hype the unregulated free market, in the face of both qualitative and empirical evidence that unregulated markets are not only unstable but are detrimental to human health and well-being.	2004-02-19

This book begins easily enough, but then quickly goes into the usual formal shorthand notation that I call 'computerize'. However maybe this book is less forbidding than the later and still popular texts on computability. Cantor's diagonal argument is presented as an appendix, and other appendices provide mini-biographies of the main contributors to computability theory. Although the book is titled &quot;Automata&quot;, no biography of von Neumann is presented (see &quot;Prisoner's Dilemma&quot; by Poundstone). Degrees of complexity are not defined in Hopkin and Moss. Von Neumann's original qualitative definition of complexity is given in &quot;Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata&quot;, which is about complexity. Actually, for a clearer and more up to date discussion of automata, maybe one should read Marvin Minsky's &quot;Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines&quot;, which also is not completely daunting in appearance.<br />I pieced together my incomplete understanding of computability more by reading various old papers, and by talking with my mathematician colleague Julian Palmore, than from a single text.	2004-02-19

Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Slaughterfield of the Future	Informative, written from a journalistic standpoint based on extensive travel in the central Asian republics. Unfortunately, Scholl-Latour should have provided extensive background information about the places and people he reports on. He assumes that we've all followed the news (and know history) within the central Asian republics as well as he has, so it's hard to keep track of all the names thrown around, much less to know the views and positions that they represent.<br />The book is written too much like a half-worked-over diary. The articles on Afghanistan were written just as the Taleban took over in 1995, so it's interesting to see (post 9/11) that he was right about the ignorant religious fanaticism of the Talebs/Tulub. In any case, we in the west are excessively ignorant of the region, as well as the subset of fundamentalist ideas that present the greatest threat to personal freedom in the world today. In the book, the author writes about several of the springs of Islamic fundamentalism: Afghanistan, Chechnya, and, as asides,  Pakistan and Saudi Arabi. The latter two friends\\" of the US created/financed/ armed the Taleban. He causes us to think, implicitly, of  the dangerously shortsighted US policy of that time: backing Pakistan's fundamentalist adventures against the Iranians and Russians in a three-way fight to control shipping and pipeline routes in Afghanistan. Scholl-Latour warned us in 1995 of the religious fanaticism of the Taleban. It was the Mujahedin (and one must separate the Fundamentalist from the nonFundamentalists in Afghanistan), armed with American and English-made shoulder rocket launchers, that shot down the Russian helicopters and turned the tide of the war. I still recall a news photo (post 1987 of an tall, light-skinned American CIA operative sitting grinning on a hillside with a rocket launcher on his shoulder. Scholl-Latour had wondered in 1985 what would happen if the Afghans got such rockets, and two years after they got them the Russians pulled out (1989). Then, America and Europe sat idly by while the Taleban rolled over the country, failing to listen to the warnings of the legendary N. Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud who, after driving out the Russians, had to appeal to Moscow for arms to stop the Taleban. There was a lot, useful, that Clinton could have done in that bubble-market era besides than exploring Monica Levinsky's underwear. On the ignorance of the Bush Administration, one need not waste words. Reports are that the official government of Afghanistan turns loose Taleban leaders from the region where Bin Laden is supposed to be hiding, as soon as they're caught (Der Spiegel,22 Sept. 2003, Bin Laden auf der Spur\\" ). And, that the Pakistani military supplies the Taleban in that region.<br />My wife gave me this book for Christmas, 2002. I found it to be hard reading, it did not hold my attention. I only picked it up again and started reading in earnest after reading \\"Drachenla&uuml;fer\\", which is a novel but is far more informative about Afghanistan that what Scholl-Latour has written. A very good source of information about Afghanistan is Jason Elliot's An Unexpected Light\\". Elliot, like Scholl-Latour, had direct contact with various Mudjahedin groups and leaders. One might also try journalistin Åsne Seierstad's \\"Bokhandleren i Kabul\\", which provides an account of her travels with The Northern Alliance, and more importantly an insider's picture of the lives of women in traditional Islamic society, a revelation that would have been inaccessible to a male journalist. I have not read her book yet.<br />I refer repeatedly to this 'enclopedia' while reading other books about Afghanistan. What I found most informative: the map showing the languages of the various regions. Where else does one learn that Pashtuns and Kurds speak the most closely related dialects of Farsi? I must say that the book becomes more valuable as one learns to identify and separate the main actors (in Afghanistan: Massoud, Dostum, Hekmatyr, Ismail Khan, and others). And one asks oneself: who financed/armed the various groups, without which aid no fighting would have been possible?

The entire field of genetic and cancer discoveries, all of microbiology, is nothing but plain ol' reductionism applied to very long molecules, molecules so long and often disordered in shape that new techniques of chemical analysis had to be invented (like PCR). This book and any standard text on molecular biology provides full evidence for the truth of my assertion.	2004-02-12

The original English version must be extremely good because I read the German translation (given to me by my wife as a gift) and found it to be first rate. I wonder how much of the book is autobiographical. One gets the author's view of Afghan society, as well as interesting facts that are independent of the author's viewpoint. We learn, e.g., that Farsi (Dari) is the official language, and that the Pushtun have more or less enslaved the Hazara as uneducated servants. Terrible racism and brutality are portrayed. Extreme brutality occured seldom, but when it did I felt it in my stomach.  The role of women? Only there to serve the men, when seen at all. The author's opinion is that the Taliban is worst than were the communists, which is believeable. Under the mullacracie there was the regression from servanthood and brutality to murder and massacre. Khaled writes that the Talib \\"rats\\" went back into their holes after US troops arrived, but there are many fundamentalists and they are still operating too freely from their nests all over the world. On my wall hangs a newspaper picture from Fall, 2001, of some American Special Forces troops riding on horseback along with members of The Northern Alliance in the mountains. I hope that the photo reflects truth, that it was not 'cooked' like so much else under the Bush Administration.<br />Novelists should take extreme care (following Hemingway in \\"A Farewell to Arms\\". e.g.), to be historically and geographically accurate, because their work has greater effect than the history texts in forming peoples' opinions of other places and cultures. For more on Afghanistan under the Taliban mullacracie, see [...] I haven't yet read Aasne Seierstad's \\"Bokhandleren i Kabul\\", which provides an account of her travels with The Northern Alliance, but more importantly an inside view of the lives of women in traditional Islamic society, a view that would have been inaccessible to a male journalist.<br />For a very sympathetic inside picture of Afghan warriors and the Afghan peoples generally, seen through English eyes, read \\"An Unexpected Light\\".

The problem was to understand how an orbit can be deterministic and apparently random. When I read Hodges' description of the Turing machine then I realized that it is easy to answer the question, and was able to write down the answer: one simply digitizes the map or ode, initial condition, and all the control parameters in some base of arithmetic, and then studies the action of a (digitized) positive Liapunov exponent on a digit string. I can't comment on the rest of the book, but Hodges does a very good job of presenting Turing's ideas of computable numbers and computable functions. When my collaborator Palmore read the description I refer to here, he said that he nearly fell out of his chair. We solved the problem of computability of chaotic orbits in that era together.<br />Is there a good book on computability and automata? So far, all the automata texts that I'm aware of are written in a special holy language of abstract computerize.  The language erects an unnecessary barrier  to understanding the basic ideas. Is Turing's original paper a proof, or an explanation of what he'd understood? I don't know, but I can refer the reader to &quot;Descartes' Dream&quot; by Reuben and Hersch for perespective.	2004-02-04

Arnol'd shows sympathy for Hooke and argues that Hooke, not Newton, should be given credit for the inverse square law of gravity. However, I find Newton's approach to be more convincing. Arnol'd praises Newton's geometric insight and reminds us that Leibnitz mechanized the rules of calculus so that (fortunately, I would say) it can be taught to idiots. Interesting and highly entertaining descriptions of the nonsense of the extreme formalization of simple mathematical problems (in the hands of the Bourbaki school of math, e.g.) can be found in the footnotes.<br />A note to students: classical mechanics, in most texts, is taught in totally unphysical postulational style, divorced from experiment/observation. This is an anachronism. If you ask the typical physics professor \\"What, exactly, is the origin of the inverse square law of gravity, how was it discovered?\\", then he/she will not be able to explain it. Textbooks, blindly present a postulatory exposition (bad physics!) and merely plug an assumed force law (where did it come from!?) into The Second Law and derive Kepler's orbits, but this is not an explanation how Newton arrived at \\"1/r^2\\" in the first place. Hooke's explanation can be found in the monograph reviewed here. Newton's original \\"inverse solution\\" can be found in my book \\"Classical Mechanics\\", where the connection of apples with the discovery of the law of gravity is also explained, following \\"Principia\\".<br />Having written all that, I strongly recommend this beautifully-written little monograph for both enlightenment and entertainment.	2004-02-04

Books	5	6	6	N	N	Why we can discover laws of nature	Although simply written, this is not a book for beginers. On the other hand it doesn't hurt to read it early and think about it for a long time, rereading it from time to time, in order finally to get the main point. Wigner points out that the basis for answering the question posed by him, 'Why is it possible to discover laws of nature?' is explained in every elementary physics text but the point is too subtle, is therefore lost on nearly every reader. The answer, he explains convincingly, lies in invariance principles. As an example, were local Galilean invariance not true it would have been impossible for Galileo to have discovered any law of motion at all. The same holds for local translational, rotational and time-translational invariance. Inherent in Wigner's argument is the explanation why the so-called principle of general covariance is not the foundation of general relativity, which also is grounded in the local invariance principles of special relativity.<br />Contrast this with the nonsense propagated in the first chapter of Samuelson's well-sold Economics text, where he asserts on the basis of a hokey picture that the difference between physics and the social sciences is not as great as it seems. In fact, there are no known invariance principles in the socio-economic sciences, and no corresponding laws of socio-economic motion (motion of money, e.g.). At best, there are intelligent gambling strategies like the equations for predicting option pricing, but these depend on market statistics that can change from one era to the next. Nor is it guaranteed that options traders will forever favor the dalta-hadging strategy and it's refinements. The last word: mathematical modelling and computer simulations are a completely different cat than approximate predictions based on laws of nature, like the laws of physics and genetics. The fact that we cannot yet (if ever) solve the Navier-Stokes equations for turbulence, which are grounded in local invariance principles and physical law, has nothing to do with our general inability to model human behavior mathematically.s and physical law, has nothing to do with our general inability to model human behavior mathematically.	2004-02-03

It presents Feynman's interpretation of quantum mechanics in chapter 1 via the two-slit experiment, and the rest of the book is devoted to showing how to formulate and calculate the one particle Green function for simple systems, systems with completely integrable classical analogs (it's implicitly assumed that Ldt is a closed differential, where L is the classical Lagrangian). The path integral formulation was also later used by other researchers to arrive at a semi-classical approximation to the three body problem, a nonintegrable and even chaotic classical system (nonintegrable classical systems cannot be solved by the standard method of finding a complete set of commuting constants of the motion).<br />The functional integral formulation of Brownian motion was formulated earlier by Norbert Wiener. An analogous formulation of quantum theory was arrived at independently by Feynman, who took seriously a conjecture by Dirac about the meaning of the exponential of the classical action as a probability amplitude. A more complete treatment of classical Brownian motion (including the so-called 'Feynman-Kac formula' for Brownian motion) was given later by Mark Kac in \\"Probability and Related Methods in the Physical Sciences\\".<br />Chapter one presents with Feynman's interpretation of quantum mechanics, the interpretation accepted by theorists today, as nonclassical rules for combining probability amplitudes for particle propagation. Waves are not mentioned because the mental gyrations inherent in the Copenhagen 'wave-particle duality' are completely avoided in the Dirac-Feynman approach. See, as forerunner of  Feynman's interpretation, Dirac's discussion of photons interfering with themselves in a hypothetical two-slit experiment, in the introduction to his famous text \\"Quantum Mechanics\\".<br />In other words, this book is for students who are ready to face the fact that there is no 'wave-particle' picture, or any geometrical picture of reality, at the quantum level: the reader who really understands Feynman's description of the two-slit experiment will realize that we cannot say about the hydrogen atom that an electron is moving about the nucleus, unless we do a scattering experiment to detect the electron (an electron doesn't follow a path, nor is it in two different places at the same time, there is in the end only the space-time propagation of quantized fields). As Feynman admitted, we do not really 'understand' quantum mechanics, although we can do all of the calculations describing experiments. The 'measurement problem', the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper and subsequent experiments and papers on quantum teleportation make this viewpoint clear. Quantum mechanics, nature at the microscopic level, is stranger than anything that you can imagine!<br />The Dirac-Feynman interpretation of quantum theory is presented by Sakurai, who also discusses the measurement problem. Merzbacher doesn't teach Dirac-Feynman but does discuss Galilean invariance via gauge transformations, and sets up the two-body problem in a form that is useful for understanding the enstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper.um Mechanics\\".<br />In other words, this book is for students who are ready to face the fact that there is no 'wave-particle' picture, or any geometrical picture of reality, at the quantum level: the reader who really understands Feynman's description of the two-slit experiment will realize that we cannot say about the hydrogen atom that an electron is moving about the nucleus, unless we do a scattering experiment to detect the electron (an electron doesn't follow a path, nor is it in two different places at the same time, there is in the end only the space-time propagation of quantized fields).

After trying unsuccessfully for years to quantize the helium atom via the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules (which attempt Einstein had already explained in 1917 to be hopeless, because the classical 3-body problem is nonintegrable), Heisenberg was finally motivated by the example of relativity (where absolute time had to be abandoned) to give up the assumption that the position and momentum of a point particle are simultaneously predictable. To follow Heisenberg's reasoning the reader must first understand action-angle variables in classical mechanics. With Einstein's 1917 paper in hindsight, the three body problem representing the helium atom energy spectrum was finally approximated semi-clasically around 1990 based on a path-integral approximation to a chaotic Hamiltonian system.	2004-01-22

Notable, however, is that 'Stratonovich calculus' is not presented, which is just as well because Ito calculus is used nearly universally in finance theory now. Implicit conditions for an approach to equilibrium are presented via eigenfunction expansions, but the reader should take care to notice that when the spectrum becomes continuous then there is no stationary limit, in spite of the fact that the stationary distribution still appears in the expansion with vanishing eigenvalue. Nonstationary processes are discussed later in the text, but the reader should pay attention that the integrals (4.67) required for the existence of the spectral density (4.66) do not exist (are infinite) whenever the process is nonstationary, which includes most cases of practical interest (for a Wiener process, e.g.). I emphasize this because financial math texts often toss bones to the idea of 'equilibrium conditions' and then discuss processes that are only nonstationary with no stationary limit (the Osborne-Black-Scholes lognormal model, e.g.).<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for physics and engineering students, as well as for students of economics and finance.<br /><br />Note added in 2/2007: this is nearly the only text out there that distinguishes stationary from nonstationary increments. That topic is, in a nutshell, by far the most important idea for analyzing data correctly and for classifying stochastic proceses theoretically. I've looked at more 'modern' books like Risken and Gardiner and am left cold: I refer to Stratonovich and Wax (the Wang-Uhlenbeck paper) extremely often, they're my bibles, I also find Genedenko to be very helpful.

Fun, easy to read. Starts with a number theoretic contribution of Viete (who made a step toward formulating algebraic questions with alphabetic symbols, a task later carried out by his countrymen Descartes and Fermat) and goes on to discuss the statistical distributions of blocks of digits appearing in decimal expansions of numbers. For a related discussion see Niven's \\"Irrational Numbers\\". Statistical distributions of blocks of digits are used implicitly and explicitly in symbollic dynamics in deterministic chaos. A word of warning: so-called 'normal numbers' occupy the continuum with measure one, but most irrational numbers (with measure one) are not computable. Champernowne's number (in any integer base of arithmetic) is the only known computable normal number. The convergence of its digit blocks to an even distribution is too slow for use in generating pseudorandom numbers. On the other hand, the digits of pi play good 5-handed poker for about 500000 base 10 digits, but we do not know if pi is normal to any base!	2004-01-20

Arnol'd covers it, but I found Arnol'd's more abstract lattice-based proof difficult to follow. Whittaker's text also contains many problems that are useful for a modern dynamics course. As a basis for understanding modern nonlinear dynamics, or for applications of mechanics, this old text is in many respects far better than the newer 'standard' mechanics texts by Landau-Lifshitz, and by Goldstein.<br />But take care: in a general discussion of integrability (conserved quantities) for general systems of odes early in the book, Whittaker does not distinguish local from global integrability.

In the book Schr&ouml;dinger coins the idea of a genetic code carried by linear molecules with his phrase 'code-script'. He asks how, in the absence of validity of a large n limit required by statistical physics for the validity of any macroscopic biological laws, can the chromsome molecules that carry the code-script yield stable genetic rules. Then, he gives the answer: chemical bonding as predicted by quantum theory ala Heitler-London (Schr&ouml;dinger identifies quantum jumps in the chrosomes as the origin of mutations, which are also discrete). He  refers to the chromosome fibers as linear 'aperiodic crystals' (to emphase their stability in the face of thermal fluctuations) and encourages physicists to study them: he boldly asserts that both the instructions and mechanism for generating organisms via molecular replication are contained in the chromosome molecules (and there is where the \\"complexity\\" lies). This book encouraged physicists to study problems of complexity long before the term complexity had become the catchword that it is today. Indeed, our first ideas of 'complexity' were developed parallel in the same era by Turing and von Neumann.<br />Schr&ouml;dinger is buried in Alpbach (Tirol), where he lectured and enjoyed the Alps frequently after WWII in a school organized by one of two brothers who, according to a very well-informed source, formed nearly the only Resistance in Austria during the war.

The second part is unconvincing: too much propaganda and too little hard analysis. The aim of the book is certainly worthwhile, but the book itself is so poorly written that I hesitated for over a year before reworking and posting this review. A far more useful and reliable source of information, based on real experience with the IMF and world Bank, is Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz's book Globalization and it's Discontents\\".<br />The choice of title is very catchy (Coca Cola und Heiligerkrieg, in the German translation)  but the title will turn some readers off automatically, post 9/11. The theme, however, is not at all Islam per se, but more generally tribalism and fundamentalism vs globalization of capital, labor and production via deregulation of markets. By tribalism in this context is meant any ethnic group that still is bound together culturally and geographically, in contrast with the destabilizing influence of unregulated free markets on a global scale where the dominant idea is that everything should be for sale with as high liquidity as possible (deregulation\\"). E.g., I live most of each year in a relatively tribal area, Tirol. I see \\"tribal\\" as something positive, as a synonym for cultural stability. Much of Europe is still tribal in this sense, in contrast with the US where, since the Reagan-Friedman era and the consequent right wing revolution of 1994, everything goes. Maintaining tradition (social stability\\"), in contrast, requires the drying up of liquidity. It requires rules (either written or understood) against unlimited trading and therefore against unlimited development.  It requires rules stating that a meadow or beach cannot be sold to a hotel or to a condo developer. Simply ask yourself: why do Houston and Gatlinburg look and feel so different than Oslo and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, e.g., or (closer to home) why do Telluride and Ruidosa look and feel so different than Silverton? The answer is: some degree of tradition has been maintained in the latter places via rules against development.  People who think that Gatlinburg is normal\\" and that Silverton is backward\\" will not understand the main point of Barber's book, or of this review.<br />Globalization via deregulation (or, simple, \\"globalization\\") based on rapid communication has led to the abdication of responsibility. E.g., I suggest trying to reach Ford with a question about your car. You will reach a woman who can answer the telephone, but who cannot answer any technical question whatsoever, nor can she find anyone else who can answer your question. She represents a dead end, anaolgous to Kafka's Castle\\". Global capitalism is like The Castle\\", or like a huge thermodynamic heat bath: it influences and controls everything that it touches but is itself subject to no reactive influence. This lack of responsiveness, which also feeds on economic ignorance, is the breeding ground for religious fundamentalists to become terrorists.<br />The propagation of globalization via deregulation as progress\\" is based on an implicit belief in the reliability of Adam Smith's Invisible Hand. The Invisible Hand purportedly stabilizes markets and brings them into equilibrium. We know now, empirically, that unregulated free markets are dynamically unstable. In contrast with reality, textbook economics still successfully propagates the mythology of equilibrium`, the absolutely noncomplex idea that supply can generally rise to match demand. Were this true, then in the absence of all regulations there should be no unemployment, e.g.. Real markets are not like that. Real unregulated markets are lawless because there is no social-economic analog of physics, of natural mathematical law. The only law of the marketplace is man made law. Deregulation therefore leads to unexpected new problems that are worse than the ones it purports to solve, as is illustrated by the recent economic histories of Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and a host of other Third world countries. Unfortunately for Europe, the EU is a relatively dictatorial, mainly financial, body whose main function is apparently to replace globalize the EU countries,  but this is not adequately discussed by Barber either. And the US? The outlook is hopeless until people wake up and realize that they've been taken for a bad ride, that they''re on a collision course led by ideologues who want that collision.lustrated by the recent economic histories of Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and a host of other Third world countries.

This is a first rate book for both greenhorns and experts. It starts with a mini-biography of both von Neumann and the RAND Corporation, and covers Nash's idea of equilibrium in context. Symmetric and asymmetric games, pure and mixed strategies, zero and nonzero sum games are defined and discussed. More than ten separate games are presented as very readably as examples. The famous Flood-Dresher experiment is also presented and discussed, indicating that repeated plays do not lead to (Nash) equilibria (optimization ala neo-classical economic theory is not the answer). We are told about von Neumann's awful advice to the US Government to nuke' the USSR immediately in the early fifties, and the reader will not be blamed if she calls to mind the preemptive war in Iraq' based on the Bush Administration's aim/claim to find weapons of mass destruction'. The latter is courtesy of Nietzschean-Bloomian neo-cons like Rumsfeld, Perle, and Wolfowitz.<br />Poundstone (a former physics student) informs us that war games started with the Prussian military, who invented the mother of all war games, Kriegspiel(=wargame). Von Neumann supposedly played Kriegspiel as a kid. We also learn that the game was still popular among Princeton mathematicians in Nash's time. Psychologically interesting is that vN also experienced a sequence of Cartesian-like dreams in an attempt to prove the key conjecture by Hilbert that Turing later showed to be wrong. vN's belief that neo-classical economic theory is completely wrong is also mentioned. There, as opposed to his advice about preventive war', history has shown him to be dead right.<br />In the context of the prisoner's dilemma, political conservatives are defined as defectors' while liberals tend to play cooperate'. The Bush administration provides a working, daily example of playing defect against the rest of the world. See, e.g., Kagan's book Of Paradise and Power: America vs. Europe in the New World Order' and Kristol's The War Over Iraq' for details of how the neo-cons advise playing defect. The book ends with a discussion of the ways in which game theory fails to answer basic socio-economic questions. That, in spite of the fact that game theory has been promoted as a basis for mathematizing Darwinian ideas (see the interesting but very mathematical book Evolutionary Games and Population Dynamics' by Hofbauer and Sigmund, where Eigen's replicator dynamics is given a game theoretic interpretation).<br />We learn from the iterated prisoner's dilemma experiment that people tend to cooperate in the long run, that Nash equilibria are not realized in practice (are unstable). To the question: Why do people cooperate at all?'

Poundstone asserts that most situations in real life are more like iterated prisoner's dilemmas, but this reasoning is a circular.<br />This is an excellent book.

A weakness is that (by only mentioning and not developing Ito calculus) the book does not make it clear to the reader that most stochastic processes are nonstationary. This is important: today, we are interested in far from equilibrium dynamics, much less so in dynamics near equilibrium where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds. On the other hand, the standard financial math texts (Baxter and Rennie, Steele, ...) do us no service in this direction either. The book goes beyond the older reference by Wax, which is still a very good introduction to Markov processes. In any case, no existing reference treats the general case of a space-time-dependent diffusion coefficient adequately, the case of most interest for the dynamics of financial markets. Now for details of the weak spots.<br />There are two mistakes on pages 65-68. The discussion is based on the sde dx=-R(x)dt+D(x,t)^1/2dB(t) where B(t) is a Wiener process. First, it is claimed that the random force D(x,t)^1/2dB is Gaussian with a white spectrum. In general, the random force is not even stationary unless D is independent of x. The unstated assumption is that the random force is always stationary, so that with R(x)&lt;0 there is an approach to equilibrium. When the diffusion coefficient depends on x (or more generally on (x,t)) then there is no approach to equilibrium for the case of unbounded x even with R&lt;0, as the lognormal model of standard finance theory so vividly shows. Second, even if an equilibrium solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation 'exists', it cannot be reached dynamically when the force is nonstationary. Again, the lognormal model illustrates this point. Arguments (typical in economics) that an equilibrium solution 'exists' are meaningless are useless if the dynamics can't approach that solution.	2003-05-26

This book describes the feeling of being thrown into a society that one does not belong to, where it's impossible to belong because , first, the past (the writer's old culture) has been disconnected from him, and, second, in the modern society the external circumstances change too fast and unpleasantly for the mind and soul to adapt.<br />The book is about a fragment of modern English-speaking society, seen from the perspective of an acute observer from a wildly different culture. The observer's original culture was destroyed by immigration, and he tries to interpret fragments of it from his childhood, like the meaning of sweeping the dirt outside the house each morning. From a related perspective, one can also read Spengler's 'Decline of the West', and John Berger's Pig Earth.<br />I picked up this book and began reading it at a friend's weekend house and couldn't stop. So, I bought my own copy. That was thirteen years ago. This remains one of my favorite books, in memory.

Read this book and others by the neo-conservatives (`The Threatening Storm`, `Of Paradise and Power`) in order to understand what the men who run The War Machine (Rumsfeld, Cheney, Perle, Wolfowitz) believe and act on. This book advocates the neo-conservative policy of `preemptive war` for Iraq and other `potential threats` to the US. As foreign policy, one can compare this advocacy of  preemptive war with von Neumann's early fifties advice to bomb the USSR immediately. von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematicians of all times. He contributed mightily to computer theory and design, and also contributed significantly to quantum physics. It was necessary to consider his advice, and then judge it wrong. Since the implosion of the USSR we know that Bohr and Einstein were right, that preemptive war is not the answer to national security.<br />Kristol and Kagan, unlike von Neumann, are not scientists. They are philosopher-policitians following a line though Allan Bloom that goes back through the rabid Nazi Heidegger to Nietzsche, the author of `God is Dead`. The origin of their philosophy is Nietzsche`s idea of 'the superman` and consequently  imperialist, warring strength as `virtue`. That is, in effect, the message of this awful book. Ths reader can judge for herself if she believes it to be `American` or foreign.<br />The origin of the philosophy espoused in this book lies partly in confusion over standard economic theory with economic reality. I offer the following definitions for the readers` consideration. A neo-classical economist believes, on no empirical basis whatsoever, that unregulated markets are stable and can approach equilibrium (this is the idea of Adam Smith's Invisible Hand). A neo-liberal believes in globalization via deregulation on the basis of neo-classical economics. A neo-conservative is a neo-liberal with a modern techo-army and the will and desire to use it to enforce on the globe his illusion/fantasy of the best of all possible economic worlds. The latter is basically  the message of this book. Without the terrorism of 9/11 the neo-cons could not have had an adequate excuse for putting their blood-drenched program into effect, thus making the desire of this book come true. Hitler had to burn the Reichstag in order to create enough fear and anger in Germany to destroy civil liberties there and go to war, but 9/11 fell like mana from heaven into the laps of the neo-cons, who have started a preemptive war following exactly the advice of this book, and have additionally given us the Orwellian Patriot Act`, a virtuous Nietzschean destruction of our civil liberties.<br />The reader should also consult my much earlier review of Allan Bloom's `The closing of the American Mind`. As I pointed out in that review, I  read the book and reread it many times, found it fascinating, but never could figure out what Bloom really wanted to say. Through his student Wolflowitz, we now understand much better what Allan Bloom wanted us to believe. By not making his program explicit, by keeping his scary program for America hidden, he helped the neo-cons to launch that program without the American people knowing what would follow.the will and desire to use it to enforce on the globe his illusion/fantasy of the best of all possible economic worlds.

One can read in Suetonius's 'Lives of the Caesars' how Julius Caesar attacked his friends as well as his enemies, always for purely personal gain. Is this the right example for America to follow? According to the neo-cons, it is. Their stated premise is that America does not have the same interests as Europe. This is of course not even close to the truth, but they want to make it true by shucking Europe and misusing military power to enforce their misconception of  American ideas on the rest of the world. It is clear that neither Europe nor any other country wants neo-con principles forced on it.I, as American, do not want neo-con principles forced on me! When a people is ready for a change, they make it internally, as the example of the collapse of the USSR should have taught us. The neo-conservatives are the people who stole the election in Florida (both Jeb Bush and Rumsfeld signed the 1997 neo-con 'Statement of Principles', as you can read...and then used the fear an anger from 9/11 as an excuse to invade Iraq 'in order to look for and find weapons of mass destruction'. What they really wan is quite different from what the Bush Administration has told us, but their own books (seeWilliam Kristol's 'The War Over Iraq') inform us of their desires: they want a military base in Iraq for further military invasions and, of course, they want to control the oil.	2003-04-29

The book describes the disastrous consequences of the neo-classical equilibrium rules imposed on the world by the World Bank and IMF, and their reenforcement by the US Treasury and the EU. The book is written in measured, nonideological style by a theorist and practitioneer who understands that the standard model is wrong. That theory, neo-classical equilibrium theory or 'general equilibrium theory', teaches that unregulated free markets are optimal, that they provide the highest efficiency and the best of all possible worlds. When there is a problem then the standard advice (since Friedman-Reagan-thatcher) is to deregulate (even public water supplies are now sold to global industries). But to the contrary, there is not one whit of hard empirical evidence that that viewpoint holds a drop of water. The recent empirical evidence is instead that financial markets in particular, and highly liquid markets in general, are dynamically unstable, do not admit equilibrium of any kind: Adam Smith's regulating Invisible Hand does not exist in liquid markets.<br />Stiglitz provides us with one practical example after the other of the instability of deregulated markets. That is the value of this book. The author could have begun better by explaining to us just who/what are the supra-national, bureaucratic powers known as the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, how are they financed and who holds holds the power. This would have been useful, especially as Americans are now told that their democratically-elected (excepting the current occupant) government should adhere to the nondemocratically-imposed rules of the WTO. And ithe EU, the Agiculture Minister announces to us that EU agriculture policies are in violation of IMF rules. Stiglitz might also have explained to us what exactly is the EU, aside from being just one more globalizing, nondemocratic organization. Most Europeans, safe to say, haven't the faintest idea exactly what is the EU, and apparently the bureaucrats who run it want to keep it exactly that way.say, haven't the faintest idea exactly what is the EU, and apparently the bureaucrats who run it want to keep it exactly that way.	2003-02-17

Darwin, in contrast, followed the Aristotelian tradition of observing qualitatively and trying to explain phenomena in the absence of experiments or systematic mathematical observations. Darwin imagined an 'integrated' picture of heredity that was completely wrong.<br />In reality 'holism' is impossible as science: every model that can be constructed is an example of reductionism. If it is good reductionism, like cell biology, then the model can be falsified. Creationism, of course, is not science because it does not present us with falsifiable propositions. Darwinism can't be tested at the macro-level because macroscopic laws of time evolution in biology do not exist.,  so far as we understand the matter. However, evolution at the cellular level is observable and is well-documented, saving the day for Darwin's basic idea.	2003-01-31

This program will not work because of lack of uniqueness, as is explained by the work on generating partitions in nonlinear dynamics. Given any sttistical distribution, one can find infinitely-many different automata that can be programmed to generate that distribution. Mirowski's suggestion cannot be carried out in any meaningful sense for that reason. In finance theory we have recently (with Gunaratne) deduced a particular stochastic dynamics from market histograms, and there we also have faced nonuniqueness in identifying the underlying dynamics. The bigger and more immediate problem is to find nonfinancial economic data that are accurate enough to draw any meaningful conclusion from the purely empirical histograms.<br />Now for the irritation. I find it academically irresponsible in this day and age to equate Newtonian mechanics with 'equilibrium'. From the beginning, Newtonian mechanics was about periodic and quasiperiodic orbits. The orbits that were studied prior to 1900 typically have neutral equilibria. To be 'in equilibrium' in such a case, the earth (for example) would have to sit at the center of the sun. Poincare' discovered chaos in Hamiltonian systems around 1900. In a chaotic system all equilibria are unstable but the orbits are bounded. See Ivars Peterson's 'Newton's Clock' for a description of the history of the discovery of chaos in the solar system. Toffoli and Fredkin discovered Turing machine-level complexity in a Newtonian system (constructed of billiard balls) around 1983, and Chris Moore (now at the Santa Fe Institite) showed around 1993 that certain area preserving maps are equivalent to Turing machines. In other words, Newtonian systems can exhibit not merely chaos but maximum complexity as well. The misidentification of Newtonian mechanics with 'equilibrium' or simple mechanics should now be laid to rest once and for all. It would be more accurate to say that the economists borrowed the idea of static equilibrium from Archimedes. Also, take note please that every digital computer is a Newtonian electromechanical system.d be more accurate to say that the economists borrowed the idea of static equilibrium from Archimedes.

The role of mark to market accounting in allowing and even encouraging companies to mislead investors with false financial statements is convincingly explained. What I missed, however: the analytic side that would show the extent to which derivatives trading losses (was there a net gain or loss, how big?) fanned the flames of the financial instability and spurred on the drive to report imaginary profits from newly-created sub-ventures. The greatest failure of the book is to present individuals as the culprits instead of focusing on the deregulated economic system that the high-rollers operated within. This is related to the historic failure of the Democratic Party in our era, to have bought into the belief that unregulated free markets are stable and provide the best of all possible worlds.

The book explains utility maximization, indifference curves, and the assumptions underlying the standard economic model that is used by the IMF, the World Bank and all major western governments. Keen uses simple language that even the lay person can follow. The text should be standard reading for every student of elementary economics, but even an experienced economist like Alan Greenspan might benefit from the clarity of thought displayed therein.<br />Macroeconomic theory is covered from the right perspective, from the result of Sonnenshein et all which shows the basis in microeconomic theory for the standard macroeconomic model. Kirman is mentioned but his seminal connection of liquidity demand with uncertainty is not discussed. The work of Radner should have been included, but then Samuelson and Varian do not discuss Radner's contribution either.Chapter 7 presents the correct perspective on general equilibrium theory, with good advice for students of econ 101.Chapter 8 on Keynes is outstanding, presenting the clearest (and even correct!) textbook discussion of Keynes that I am aware of. Marx's contribution to the basis of capitalism, the recognition of the central role played by the profit motive, is also made apparent in the Keynsian context. The profit motive is ignored completely in Samuelson and the other standard texts, which discuss merely pure barter economies and leave out financial markets altogether. Hicks' interpretation of Keynes' ideas is also correctly presented. All in all, students of economics would be well advised to make Keen's book their main econ text.	2002-12-11

The news from Lake Wobegon: networking does not explain it all, especially not the lopsided distribution of wealth. Networking cannot even explain the observed statistics of financial markets! For the history of the development of the Enron Society (globalization via deregulated free markets since the implosion of resistance from the now-defunct USSR), see 'Liar's Poker' and 'FIASCO' (I hereby recommend MD, LP, and F to the authors of Lexus-Nexus et al). Friedman might also have benefited from an orientation that is not purely Wall Street, Israel, and The Grand Hotel (try an alpine village, where olive trees still win over Lexus). The main error of today's popular belief in the US, even within the Democratic Party leadership: that unregulated free markets must be 'The Answer' because they won over Communism. Europe has a middle way, and since the news from Enron, WCom, et al, I suspect that that middle way (social safety net, rules that prevent Enronization of society, etc) will now tend to persist. Enron and Wcom have done more damage to US credibility than could have been done by any enemy government, all compliments of Reagan-Friedman era deregulation. This is today's prediction from Lake Wobegon...	2002-08-21

However, the book unnecessarily propagates ideology. First, it makes excuses for the fact that the empirically wrong notion of utility ('maximizing behavior') is totally disconnected from the Black-Scholes model. Second, the text propagates Black and Schole's original mistaken claim that CAPM produces the same option pricing pde as does the delta hedge. A careful and correct calculation shows that this claim is wrong, that with the wrong assumption made by B-S the fractions invested in both the stock and the option are zero! For the correct result, including the difference in option pricing via delta hedge and CAPM, see my recent paper \\"An Empirical Model for Volatiliy of Returns and Option Pricing' with Gunaratne. A third criticism is that only Gaussian returns are discussed in this text, but the empiciral distribution is far from Gaussian and is approximately exponential, with nontrivial volatility.<br /><br />Note added 2/25/07: The martingales presented as elementary examples are very instructive, if you derive them yourself (in some cases, some thought is required to figure out why this initial condition or that boundary condition). The Black-Scholes solution as martingale for arbitrary drift and diffusion coefficients is presented as a Feynman-Katz functional integral on pg. 272, but with unnecessarily complicated notation. However, eqns. (15.25) and (15.27) are inconsistent and (15.25) is wrong: you cannot freely shift coordinate origins because the x-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients break translational invariance. For a more complete treatment, see cond-mat/0702517 on xxx.lanl.gov. See Friedman's \\"Stochastic Differential Equations\\" for the correct, and very general treatment of solving pdes via running Ito processes. I tried to follow Durrett on that topic but Durrett is much less general (Friedman had already solved the Black-Scholes type case presented in Steele!) and I'm not yet convinced that Durrett is completely problem free. In any case, Friedman is by far more straightforward.<br /><br />A word of warning to the unwary about \\"Levy's characterization of Brownian motion\\", part 12.5, pg. 204: for a Martingale M(t) then M^2(t)-t is generally NOT a martingale, and in that case the theorem is useless (the identification of the integral in (12.38) as \\"t\\" is then impossible). For martingales, the integration by parts formula shows that M^2(t)-integral(dM)^2 is a martingale.resented in Steele!) and I'm not yet convinced that Durrett is completely problem free.

The basis for the text are the contributions of Shannon, Turing, von Neumann, Wiener, Koopmans, Marshak, and Arrow. Mirowski tells us the main story of the interaction of the Cowles Commission with RAND, which Bernstein does not at all hint at in his Capital Ideas. Having praised the book, I will now concentrate mainly on a few points of disagreement. Undecidability should not be confused with noise in stochastic processes. Systems at the transition to chaos can define automata that can perform simple arithmetic. That 'cyborg' has it's origin in the physical sciences seems farfetched (the connection between Turing and physics is supposed to be via Maxwell's demon, but was Turing really motivated by the idea of Maxwell's demon?). Nonlinear dynamics and fractals ('chaos' and fractals) certainly did not evolve from cybernetics or 'system theory' ('system theory' was based at best on an awareness of equilibria and limit cycles of differential equations, and made vague, unjustifiable allusions to holism). Cybernetics cannot really be seen as the midwife of what is now loosely called 'complexity' either, rather, that (still undefined) field grew out of nonlinear dynamics, neural networks, computability theory and molecular biology. Mirowski is right that many scientists confuse simulations with experiment and observations. I have argued against this confusion in papers and books.<br />Mirowski paints an intriguing picture of (Gödel-influenced) von Neumann, RAND, researchers with awareness of information and computability limitations leading to agent-based modelling with some respect for empiricism on the one hand, and then, on the other hand, Arrow, the Cowles Commission and their later rejection of empirics, instead with emphasis on Bourbaki-style existence proofs leading to infinte demands on information requirements on Walrasian agents andnoncomputable equilibria. We now know that agent-based modelling can easily lead to fat-tailed price distributions (as observed empirically), whereas in contrast the origin of the systematic head-in the-sand philosophy of the neo-classical economic theorists is made quite clear in this work. One can summarize the neo-clasical economic agent as follows: his dynamics are trivial (equilibrium, including Nash  equilibria) but the information demands made on him to interact with other agents and locate an equilibrium point are impossible (noncomputable). Moreover, we now know that financial market statistics point toward the instability of Adam Smith's hand, so that the notion of dynamic equilibrium is complelety uninteresting so far as understanding markets is concerned.	2002-06-18

States the (nonempirical) postulates explicitly (excepting the postulate of stability), illustrates how this leads to the prediction that regulations reduce efficiency, discusses game theory, law and econ, IT, and assymetric information. See my review of Microeconomics by the same author. Note also that, as in Microeconomics, there is no discussion of real empirical data. With only three exceptions there are no graphs obtained from real market data in Intermediate Microeconomics. Also, no mention of Radner's proof that equilibria make demands of information acquisition and processing on agents that cannot be met even by a Turing machine. Also, no discussion of the fact that (a) financial market data indicate stochastic dynamic models that have no equilibria either dynamically or statistically, and (b) when equilibria do occur in stochastic models of financial markets, then they are unstable (financial markets are not discussed in the text aside from the CAPM: there is no demand for liquidity in neo-classical economic theory, money is unnecessary, as is the Fed). The student should keep in mind that this is an already-falsified theory (a belief system) that does not describe how any market works in reality. In order to understand where and why this text goes wrong, read mirowski's Machine Dreams'.	2002-06-17

Also nice, the gambler's ruin is presented as an example of affine scaling.

More to the point, even their noncomputerese notation is difficult to follow. I hope for a very different second edition written pedagogically for students of this growing and important field. On the positive side, data analyses are performed using logarithmic returns, not price increments. Workers in the field who consult this text will find it helpful.	2002-06-06

The discussions of convolutions of distributions, Levy distributions and scaling are well-written and easy to follow. In the brief discussion of the St. Petersburg Paradox I missed a critical discussion of expected utility, which was invented by Bernoullli to 'resolve' that paradox. Spurred by von Neumann and Morgenstern, neo-classical economics relies on the idea of expected utility, which seems empirically to be wrong. The chapter on time correlations is also very readable (although Wiener processes are not 1/f^2 noise!). ARCH and GARCH methods are discussed, saving the student from the pain of reading badly-written papers by mathematically-minded economists, but the chapters on options are too brief with nothing new. The best introduction to options is still the original Black-Scholes paper (excepting their erroneous claim that CAPM and the delta-hedge strategy produce option pricing pdes that agree with each other). Also, it would have been nice to have seen a discussion of CAPM. The discussion of algorithmic complexity left me cold (see my earlier books and papers on nonlinear dynamics), and I would like to have seen a critical discussion of the EMH. These criticisms are ok, though, the gaps leave something for the rest of us to work on.	2002-06-05

An exponential distribution is given as an example how the CLT fails. I was first happy to see a chapter devoted to portfolio selection, but the chapter (like most of the book) is very difficult to follow (I gave up on that chapter, unhappily, because it looked interesting). The notation could have been better (to be quite honest, the notation is horrible), and the arguments (many of which are original) could have been made sharper and clearer. For my taste, too many arguments in the text rely on uncontrolled approximations, with Gaussian results as special limiting cases. The chapters on options are original, introducing their idea of history-dependent strategies (however, to get a strategy other than the delta-hedge does not not require history-dependence, CAPM is an example), but the predictions too often go in the direction of showing how Gaussian returns can be retrieved in some limit (I find this the opposite of convincing!). For an introduction to options, the 1973 Black-Scholes paper is still the best (aside from the wrong claim that CAPM and the delta-hedge yield the same results). The argument in the introduction in favor of 'randomness' as the origin of macroscopic law left me as cold as a cucumber. On page 4 a density is called 'invariant' under change of variable whereas 'scalar' is the correct word (a common error in many texts on relativity). The explanation of Ito calculus is inventive but inadequate (see instead Baxter and Rennie for a correct and readable treatment, one the forms the basis for new research on local volatility). Also, utlility is once mentioned but never criticized. Had the book been more pedagogically written then one could well have used it as an introductory text, given the nice choice of topics discussed.	2002-06-05

One can use affine fractals to draw pictures of mountain landscapes, but the rules of fractal construction teach you absolutely nothing about the physics or geology of mountain formation. Likewise, you will learn nothing about leopards simply from constructing patterns that look like leopard spots. Computational universality is very powerful: you can compute any computable number or function, but the way that those numbers and functions appear empirically in nature will remain not explained. To believe that nature is like a ca says nothing unless the program is specified. where did the program come from? I recommend instead the chapters on symmetry as the basis of physical law in Wigner's Symmetries and Reflections, a very beautiful book.	2002-05-29

It was a real pleasure to learn from it. Later in life I found that I did not need it at all as background for research. The reason for this is that the book is strong on formalism but weak on analysis of hard problems. The problem with the text is that it was written in the age when classical mechanics was thought to be useful mainly as preparation for studying quantum mechanics, and the later emphasis on canonical perturbation theory as background for studying accelerator physics still did not distinguish integrable from nonintegrable systems.<br />The text is useful for learning Lagrangian formalism, Poisson brackets and the formulation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism for fields. However, it provides only integrable examples-the newest version throws a too-often chewed bone in the direction of 'chaos', but otherwise the examples and problems are of the globally integrable type. Worse, global integrability is implicitly assumed but is then confused with local integrability via the trivially correct claim that initial conditions are adequate for solving Hamilton's equations via backward in time integration. Liouville's integrability theorem, the condition for the existence of a global canonical transformation to action angle variables (or for solving the H-J pde globally) is not even mentioned. For a treatment of Classical Mechanics (including damped, driven Newtonian systems) from the standpoint of the methods of modern nonlinear dynamics, see my book Classical Mechanics (Cambridge, 1997).	2002-05-22

I used it to to read about utility (after reading Samuelson's papers), also to learn about the (utility-free) capital asset pricing model, which is presented via a simple derivation. A description of Scarf's counterexample in 'equilibrium dynamics' is also presented, if too sketchy. One would have liked to see Radner's '67 paper discussed here as well, and the proof that even if textbook demand-price, supply-price curves existed individually, the aggregate curves could be anything, including no curve at all, just a scatter of points. Osborne showed earlier that the textbook supply-demand curves do not exist empirically and explained quanlitatively why they do not exist in the individual case. I explained quantitatively in a paper 'The Futility of Utility' (Physica A, 2000) why such curves do not due to nonintegrability of the underlying dynamics of production, thereby resolving Mirowski's thesis in an unexpected way.<br />So what's the problem? The theory is presented as if it would qualify as an internal logic system, not as science, it's presented as if data did not exist (theory without data, whereas econometrics is data without theory). There is essentially no comparison with empirical data in this text, and there is a good reason for that: all comparisons with real markets show that the utility-based theory is totally wrong. Not only is the standard assumption of 'equilibrium'(and the implicit assumption of stability) not a good zeroth order approximation to markets, these ideas do not even provide a BAD zeroth order approximation to market dynamics, which markets are totally unstable and far from equilibrium in every known case. The retort of the academic economists (the empiricist Greenspan does not belong to that school) that 'we are only trying to understand the ideal case' is so far off the mark as to be ridiculous. One might compare neo-classical economic theory with Aristotelian 'physics', except that the latter has one advantage: it does take into account a (wrong) qualitative description of air resistance, whereas utility maximization describes nothing that happens in real markets. To the claim that, 'but we need utility maximization to derive the CAPM' (which also does not describe real markets!), I reply, nonsense! ... .

One of our many memorable high points in Italy occured when we ended the long, boring walk down the military road from Mte. Visentine (after passing big patch of Edelweiss during ascent from the other side) toward Vittorio Veneto, in wet boots, and finally came to a Wirtshaus in Alba near day's end. We had exactly 20000 Lira, the meal cost exactly that much but we had to wait for the kitchen to open. Unlike Grassler's time, a room for the night was no longer offered. After seeing us sopping up the olive oil with the bread, the Wirt brought us more salami, free! Then he wanted to know : 'A piede a Venezia?!', after which he brought out and proudly displayed a very worn Alp&uuml;berquerung calendar (1977?) that Grassler had sent him from Bad T&ouml;lz after the end of his first M-V journey. As a result of our spiritual connection to Grassler, we got free espresso and capucino before going on toward Vittorio Veneto, which Grassler did not visit, but turned out to be one of the nicest villages (Altstadt, Seravalle) on our tour (parts of Seravalle are shown in the totally false Hollywood concoction about Hemingway, 'In Love and War').

In contrast with Lichtenberg and Lieberman, which preceded it (and was for a few years the only modern book on chaos available), it did not ignore driven-dissipative systems but rather emphasized them. Still provides a good introduction for a beginner (when one supplements it by going to the orginal literature), although I would of course recommend my own books on the subject, especially with regard to understanding what is meant by integrability/nonintegrability, what is meant by a 'chaotic orbit', and to avoid confusing randomness with deterministic chaos. It is a disease with all books on chaos that the writers do not advise the student to do backard in time integration to check the validity of forward time numerical integrations. therefore, the cookbook recipe given in those texts for calculating Liapunov exponents is wrong and misleading. Another way to say it is that deterministic chaos is not developed from the systematic standpoint of symbollic dynamics in those texts, but rather from the standpoint of meaningless numerical integrations packed full with machine errors.	2002-05-13

I took three courses using this book at age 42 (taught by visiting Norwegian women through The Norwegian Society of Texas, fantastic teachers all!) and within a year spoke Norsk as my second language (did 2-3 hours of homework each week, absolutely essential but requires 'motivation'). My German wife later erased all my answers (I wasn't happy!) and taught herself Norwegian as well over several years during our summer months in Norway. It helped to go there every summer for some months (for research and hiking). The book's weakness: colloquial speech is left out altogether. For that, see Sverre Kloumann's Learn Norwegian. We bought the three tapes for that book and my wife later used them extensively. One has the advantage that many Norwegian words are recognizable from English and/or German, but the grammer is extremely simple, like English (but more systematic), in contrast with Russian, old Norwegian, and German. Like the later three, though, the language is phonetic. Neither text teaches dialect words, a disadvantage, given that there are 28 major dialects and far more local ones, but the situation is not much worse in that respect than with German.

Also irritating: because of a singularity at the origin the damped harmonic oscillator is not recognized as integrable in spite of the existence of a global conservation law, excepting one point in phase space. Integrability is an extremely difficult subject and maybe Arnol'd could have taught us more about it. I've discussed integrability/nonintegrability from a physicist's perspective in my Classical Mechanics (Cambridge, 1997).	2002-05-10

The authors use the mathematicians' notation, labeling infinitesimal generators as tangent vectors, a notation that I personally find to be annoying. This is nearly the only readable source, in English, of Cartan's (after the fact) observation that Newtonian gravitational orbits are (limit of GR with G fixed as c goes to infinity) geodesics in space-time, with the curvature in the (x,t), (y,t) and (z,t) subspaces, with space Euclidean and time absolute.

It's one of the many 'Onsager tales' that circulate among his former students and postdocs that he'd worked through all the problems in this text (just for mental exercise) as undergrad at NTH. One can believe it if one takes the trouble to read his Ph.D. dissertation on weak electrolytes, where a pde is solved exactly by using an 'extremely inventive' method based on complex analysis (the dissertation lies in Yale's Beineke library). I later used the book, along with Stakgold (on boundary-value problems) to teach a first semester grad 'math methods' course to physics and engineering students. I must say that in that time the grad students had no difficulty working the problems, although I certainly did not assign the hardest ones (Tripos...). I usually went as far in series expansions and complex variables as the Mittag-Leffler expansion, spending about a half a semester on W&W before switching to delta functions, boundaty value problems, and Stakgold. Fuch's theorem was covered in the second semester via Bender & Orszag.	2002-05-10

The author emphasizes three big themes. The workaholic Kelly manages to lower the old ex-general psychologocally, making him no more than her baggage carrier and errand boy. As to why she needed to do this to Bastian?-no insight provided by the author, other than to lay some blame (without proof) on Kelly's grandmother. He's too weak to break away and even continues in his role, even after she starts sleeping with other men. The other theme, which no one in his right mind can disagree with, is that no matter how she manipulated him he had no right to kill her. The third theme is that it was crazy for the German media to call it a double-suicide (I read the Spiegel account years ago but have forgotten the content). She makes a good case. The book is well-worth reading. I did not have the feeling that the author was either unfair or careless (I didn't notice sparks from axes being ground) but, again, getting all the facts straight in a case like this is a Teufelsarbeit.	2002-05-09

Like Goldstein, however, the problems are all of the integrable type and there is no training provided for analyzing nonintegrable (especially chaotic) dynamical systems. Worse, one does not learn what 'integability' is from this book because it is implicitly assumed that every problem is integrable. This error follows from failing to distinguish local from global integrability. If one may be excused for criticizing the Pope, the authors make wrong and completely misleading statements about integrability (see my review of Goldstein, and also ch. 16 of my book Classical Mechanics, Cambridge, 1997). The problems and examples are indeed more challenging than those in Goldstein, and are instructive, but the text makes no contact whatsoever with the ideas and methods of modern nonlinear dynamics, in spite of the fact that (as Poincare, Arnol'd and others have shown), most of classical mechanics IS nonlinear dynamics. In other words, a student learns little from this text that is useful for research in theoretical mechanics these days. In my newer text I develope Poincare's method of qualitative analysis, and then assign as homework problems many numerical problems where in addition the students are required to check the accuracy of forward integrations in time by integrating backward to try to recover the initial conditions to within at least one digit accuracy. My text was tested for several years teaching both physics and mechanical engineering students at the graduate level, and with success. Try my text, you may find that you like it, especially since it's readability compares more with that of Goldstein than with Arnol'd.	2002-05-08

Treatment of Bertrand's theorem is beautiful, but contains one error (took me 2 years before I realized where..). However, I know of only one physicist who successully worked out all the missing steps and taught from this book. I know mathematicians who have cursed it. I used/use it for inspiration. The treatment of Liouville's integrability theorem, I found too abstract, found the old version in Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics to be clearer (Arnol'd might laugh sarcastically at this claim!)--for an interesting variation, but more from the standpoint of continuous groups, see the treatment in ch. 16 of my Classical Mechanics (Cambridge, 1997). In my text I do not restrict the discussion of integrability/nonintegrability to Hamiltonian systems but include driven dissipative systems as well. Another strength of Arnol'd: his discussion of caustics, useful for the study of galaxy formation (as I later learned while doing work in cosmology). Also, I learned from Arnol'd that Poisson brackets are not restricted to canonical systems (see also my ch. 15). I guess that every researcher in nonlinear dynamics should study Arnol'd's books, he's the 'alte Hasse' in the field.	2002-05-08

If i were to read only two travel books then this would be the second one, although both my wife and an English friend read it in German translation and reported that it was terrible. Maybe it doesn't translate well. Lawrence, as young man, describes a thread running through his life as he starts the journey by heading south toward Italy on foot from Bavaria with Frida, a way of travel that many Germans still understand very well. Descriptions of people are attractive, like the one-legged Italian who tried to seduce the cold, northern women at a dance. I liked best his description of his own Alp&uuml;berquerung, his description therein of the hurried English hiker, the way that Italins have ruined the alpine valleys with industrialization. And I felt loss at his growing distance from Frida.

Well the professor didn't understand 'curves' at a higher level: he failed to note that nearly all the 'curves' presented in the text were only 'cartoons', mere mental constructions not based on real data, and agreeing with no real data (excepting corn flakes sales in British supermarkets, if Paul Ormerod is correct). The idea of 'utility' is a useless fabrication that has no basis in empirical data. Those mental constructions represent instead the expectations of neo-classical economic theory, the religion of the IMF, World Bank, and a host of other neo-classically-educated economists. To be specific, the price-demand, price-supply 'curves' touted in the text do not exist in reality and also not in theory: e.g., see Osborne's book Finance and the Stock Market from a Physicist's Perspective for the explanation why. See also the economists' own proof that aggregate price-supply demand-suppy curves 'can be anything' even if individual supply-demand curves would behave as they expect! Furthermore, no real market is approximately in equilibrium, all real markets are examples of far from equilibrium systems. Unregulated free markets are unstable. None of this is hinted at in the text, where equilibrium and stability are implicitly and unfairly assumed without warning the unsuspecting reader. Worse, in the introductory chapter Samuelson uses a hokey, irrelevant pictorial argument to try to convince both himself and the reader that physics is as unscientific as neo-classical econ theory. For good information about econ theory, see the following books: Ormerod's The Death of Economics, Mirowski's More Heat than light, and Osborne's book. For those with enough intellectual stamina, there is also Giovanni Dosi's Innovation, Organization, and Economic Dynamics, a collection of essays that also points out that the emperor wears no clothes and tries to find a reliable ruler to replace His Uselessness. Instead of propagating misleading mythology it's now time for economists to face the facts and explain why, after convincing governments to follow their advice and deregulate, we face one big financial instability after the other: LTCM, Argentina, Enron, .... .<br />As text or as literature, this book is terribly written. Unsystematic, like a hodgepodge of review articles. Samuelson has noted that economists (like Galbraith) who write too well may be suspect by other economists, but this is an unfortunate viewpoint. The best writing is done by the clearest thinkers: Einstein (in both German and English), Feynman, V.I. Arnol'd, and Fischer Black are examples. Bad writing, in contrast, often reflects sloppy thinking. In short, this text could have been cut to half it's size, to the benefit of the reader who wants to understand what Samuelson has to say.<br />For the story of how neo-classical econ won out academically, see Mirowski's 'Machine Dreams'.nization, and Economic Dynamics, a collection of essays that also points out that the emperor wears no clothes and tries to find a reliable ruler to replace His Uselessness.

Laxness tries to convey to us the destructiveness of globalization long before it was called by that name, the destructiveness of making a liquid market in everything, putting a price on everything, eliminating all stability formed by old tradition. The girl in the story is the voice of the past, the voice from the sagas, and you cannot hear this voice at all if you have been programmed, indoctrinated by the ideology of neo-classical economic theory (the 'religion' of totally unregulated free markets, which are now known anyway to be dynamically unstable). Other books for some perspective: Berger's Pig Earth, Levi's Christ Stopped at Eboli, Barber's Jihad vs. McWorld, Ross's The Annexation of Mexico. Also strongly recommended: Laxness's Independent People. Like John Berger, Laxness points out for us the destructiveness of unregulated 'development' and suggests that the antidote lies in something that most of us have'forgotten' about the past, about human relations as human relations rather than human beings as 'rational agents' in the neo-classical economic theory implicitly assumed true by the IMF, The World Bank, and The EU, the disastrous philosophy of totally unregulated free markets that has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by recent US leaders. If you wonder why the world is in crisis, look for the answer in the assumptions that are taken for granted by the leaders, the assumptions that they don't question.	2002-05-08

In spite of that the truck keeps running without wheels, gaining in influence in law schools and in US court cases. Why this is so, how a theory without data (and, in eonometrics, data without theory) can survive and even prosper is a historico-sociological question, no easier to answer than are analogous questions about the persistence beyond the middle ages of Aristotelian theory, or the emergence of the Taliban in our own time. However, as the following quote (on microfoundations) suggests, Professor Dosi brings his criticism and ideas to us with exceptional wit and humor:<br />...I mean the construction of the dynamics of micro constituents of a system (be they molecules, ..., firms, cells,..)which yield the dynamics of some aggregate variables of the system.....the issue of microfoundations is in principle separate from that of microintentionality', although obvioulsy in social sciences the relationship between the two is a tricky problem. However, contrary to the prevalent opinion amongst economists, I think it is healthy to keep the two matters separate. ... no physicist in a right mind would claim that molecules tend in probability to some energy state because they maximize their utility', so some partial decoupling might also help investigators...\\"<br />The theme of microfoundations of aggregate phenomena is taken up in chapters 12 ans 23. As Paul Ormerod [3] has taught us, neo-classical individual demand curves do not apply to aggregate phenomena other than maybe cornflakes (indeed, Osborne [4] has taught us that they do not even apply to individuals!). Furthermore, the neo-calassicists themselves proven that, given a textbook individual demand curve, the aggregate demand curves can be anything at all [3].<br />The reader in search of recent work on modern topics will find much food for though in the 23 chapters of reprints by Dosi and collaborators. Among the topics covered are evolutionary models, many chapters on path dependence, some on computability of models, and stylized facts' (a phrase that I am still not comfortable with).<br />Nearly nothing is known about aggregates, making modelling there all the more difficult. The neo-clasical answers, Dosi correctly informs us, are too close to pre-Galilean reasoning (a theme that has been developed elsewhere, for good measure [4]). Also with foresight, Professor Dosi argues in several chapters that knowledge' is not equivalent to sheer information, which leads us into the topic of this era, the economics of information (here, he mentions the work of Arrow, Aoki, Ackerlof,, Stiglizz, Radner, Hurwicz and others).<br />In Substantive and Proceedural Uncertainty (by Dosi and Egidi) a distinction is made between information incompleteness and knowledge incompleteness. Also interesting is that the authors recognize and emphasize the difference between the nature of probability in ordinary gambling and in economics. In the former cases the number and nature of bets placed cannot change the outcome: preferences, states of nature, actions and consequences are easily separable. In this case there is an information gap (we don't know in advance wihich face of a die will show when tossed) but not a competence gap. In economics and finance, in contrast, the events' are not states of nature' but are an inseparable part of the decision process, are not independent of agenmts' actions. We read further that innovation implies nonstationarity..' and that rational procedures' may quickly run against the computational constraints of individual agents. E.g., Nash equilibria may exist' mathematically but may not be recursively realizeable (may not be algorthmically computable-for algorithmic computability innonlinear dynamics, see [5,6]). On rational choice, they write that empirical evidence on individual behaviors is messy and subject to perturbations. Especially under uncertainty people may make mistakes anticipating expected probabilites and may not maximize. Even in 2-person games winning strategies exist mathematically but may require uncountably-much knowledge in the form of the infinite binary game-tree...<br />For historic background that is helpful in understanding Dosi's choice of approach to economic theory, see Mirowski's 'Machine Dreams'.n nonlinear dynamics, see [5,6]).

The problem with Hull is that Ito's lemma is only stated, not proven, and it's the proof that shows one how to formulate correctly the stochastic integral equations that Hull calls 'stochastic difference equations'. When volatility depends on returns and/or time, then the errors made from following Hull's oversimplified treatment become serious.<br /><br />My first impression of Baxter & Rennie's 'Financial Calculus' was that it was unnecessary and a waste of money. My opinion reversed completely after realizing (under prodding by a physics colleague who's an expert on sde's) how badly Hull's approach to sde's really is. Also, the systematic derivation of Black-Scholes from the assumption of a replicating, self-financing strategy is very nice. As Feynman said, we don't really understand a result until<br />we can derive it from many different viewpoints. The method is not really different in principle from the standard short derivation given in Hull, but it does provide a nice, clear example of what is meant by replication and self-financing in the terminology of Brownian motion/sde's. A problem with the book is that one must first learn the rudiments of options elsewhere (Hull, Bodie & Merton): this is not a text for beginners.<br /><br />A word of warning: empirically seen, the results presented by the book (Black-Scholes and near-B-S) are empirically wrong. The authors present the theory as if it would be biblical, handed down by god, giving the reader no hint that the economic-financial problems discussed there merely abstractly-mathematically are not at all solved by the models presented in the text. For example, the empirical returns distribution is very far from Gaussian and is volatile (the empirical returns diffusion coefficient depends on both returns x and time t) whereas the returns pde in the B-S model has a constant diffusion coeficient. In other words, typical of mathematicians and 'financial engineers' who are not concerned with fundamentals, B&R seem not to be bothered by the fact that the B-S theory cannot be patched up and saved by a perturbative approach. Instead, a completely different starting point than lognormal pricing is required (see my paper with Gunaratne on the empirical distribution of returns and correspondingly correct option pricing).<br /><br />Note added: the treatment of Girsanov's theorem is restricted to Gaussian processes.

First and foremost, one cannot learn how correctly to formulate solutions to stochastic differential equations from this text: eqns. (10.7,8), e.g., are not correct for arbitrary returns but are valid only as approxmations for small returns (Hull leads the reader to believe the opposite). The problem is that Ito's lemma is only stated, not proven, and it's the proof that shows one how to formulate correctly the stochastic integral equations that Hull calls 'stochastic difference equations'. When volatility depends on returns and/or time, then the errors made from following Hull's oversimplified treatment become serious.<br />My first impression of Baxter & Rennie's 'Financial Calculus' was that it was unnecessary and a waste of money. My opinion reversed completely after realizing (under prodding by a physics colleague who's an expert on sde's) how badly Hull's approach to sde's really is. Also, the systematic derivation of Black-Scholes from the assumption of a replicating, self-financing strategy in B&R is very nice. As Feynman said, we don't really understand a result until we can derive it from many different viewpoints. The method is not really different in principle from the standard short derivation given in Hull, but it does provide a nice, clear example of what is meant by replication and self-financing in the terminology of Brownian motion/sde's.	2002-03-03

This small, entertaining monograph can be read superficially in a sitting and provides food for thought. It would be interesting and useful for econophysicists to try to find alternative solutions to several of the first five puzzles not based on either expected utility or 'equilibrium' arguments. Kritzman prefaces the book by stating that he will not address either the equity premium or dividend puzzle because these two problems depend on agents' psychology. He addresses instead 6 puzzles that he calls purely logical and mathematical. However, he contradicts himself in that several of the solutions depend on utility functions and therfore on agents' psychology. His background is that of money manager.<br />Siegel's Paradox is based on the fact that the average of a random variable differs from the inverse of the average of the same variable. He applies this to exchange rates with the question whether the difference is economically relevant.<br />In Liklihood of Loss the nonuniqueness of liklihood of loss is discussed. The result is used to criticize the idea of using social security funds to place bets in the stock market. Lognormal returns, which are incorrect especially for large returns, are assumed throughout the book.<br />In Time Diversification he addresses the interesting question whether agents should be more risk-tolerant with long rather than short time horizons. The conventional wisdom assumes the former, but he discusses a solution by Samuelson that contradicts this viewpoint. Samuelson's solution is, of course, based on an expected utility, which is arbitrary.<br />Why the Expected Return is Not to be Expected. Kritzman argues that the expected return has less than 50% probability of occuring.<br />Half the Stocks All the Time or All the Stocks Half the Time? Should an agent switch or balance? The balanced strategy has lower risk. Again, expected utility is referred to, but this time after the fact.<br />The Irrelevance of the Expected Return for Option Valuation. This chapter extols the use of the riskless return in the delta hedge strategy, an idea much beloved of theorists and ignored by traders. In this chapter, I am irritated that everyone under the sun (including Einstein and Wiener) gets credit for the background necessary for the Black-Scholes equation while Osborne, who introduced the lognormal distribution into finance in 1958, is completely ignored. The main point, however, is that the famous (anti-) arbitrage argument leading to a riskless hedge is wrong on two counts {1}, another example of how the economists' 'equilibrium' idea does not apply to reality.

US	52009166	R1NTLGX9HLUUFZ	0879016140	77669944	Contemporary Economics	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Very readable example of standard neo-classical nonsense	The text by Spencer and Amos is a readable source of the misconceptions that are taught to students and believed by too many economists. This text is noteworthy in presenting a chapter on 'General Equilibrium Theory' (or 'Welfare Economics'), which explicitly exhibits misconceptions about the notion of stability of equilibrium. The book seems to have been written with a supply-side rather than Keynsian prejudice..<br />The text starts by defining 'capital' in such a loose way that trees, e.g., are defined as capital, which presumes a common 'value-judgement' that is accepted in the US but not always in various parts of W. Europe where there are remain some strong restrictions on the economic 'development' of farm and forest land. The 'curves' in the book, as in Samuelson, represent no dynamcs and are generally not derived from real data. Instead they are drawn representing expectations based on the typical incomplete misunderstanding of neo-classical theory that is pervasive in economics and finance, where the dynamics of that theory have not been worked out except under the most unrealistic assumptions. An example is the so-called 'Laffer curve' on page 347. From the beginning, e.g., equilibrium is presummed to be the normal state of affairs and it is assumed to be stable, in disagreement with real liquid market data. The quotes from the text and my commentary follow next.<br />\\"Is Perfect Competition a Fantasy?\\" (pg 536): \\" ..no, ... like the assumption of a frictionless state in physics..this assumption creates an idealized situation that permits simplification of a problem so that it may be analyzed.\\" This assertion represents a deep misconception. In physics we have real data, namely local motion in a gravitational field, where the assumption of force-free motion can be tested and verified as a good approximation (on the moon even better than on earth). Force-free motion is not merely a good approximation but lies at the foundation of physics. Economists and finance theorists have not understood this. The other side of the coin is that perfect competition, as defined in the text (requiring stable equilibria) does not exist in the world as a decent approximation to anything that occurs socio-economically.<br />From chapter 30 (pp 632-3) on General Equilibrium Theory: \\"Equilibrium was defined in earlier chapters as a state of balance between opposing forces. An object is in equilibrium when it is at rest. ... In economics \\"objects\\" may be prices, quantities, incomes, or other variables. You cannot consider a problem solved if, at the point you terminate your analysis, the variables are still changing. Only when the variables settle down to steady levels, or only when the future equilibrium positions can be predicted, can you consider the solution complete.\\" Unfortunately, no real economic data behave even approximately in this way. A data analysis can be 'forced' to approach equilibrium only by abandoning real data and replacing it by a wrong model with stable equilibria. Continuing, \\"The study of equilibrium is not an end in itself. Economics is concerned with understanding the forces that can disturb an equilibrium and the policy measures that may have to be undertaken to restore it.\\" Given that there are no stable equilibria in real economic systems, the assertion is meaningless in practice. Continuing with the text, on page 633 Exhibit 1 shows three figures, (a) a cone sitting upright on it's flat base, (b) the cone balanced perfectly on it's point, and (c) the cone lying on it's side. Figure (a) is compared with the authors' cartoon of a price vs quantity 'graph' showing the intersection of supply and demand curves as equilibrium. That is, the existence of the equilibrium point in the cartoon is advertised by the authors as 'stable', which of course is wrong. There is no implication of stability in the existence of any equilibrium point, a mistake that is sometimes made by freshman students in physics. The authors go on, \\" Figure (a) illustrates a case of stable equilibrium. this represents the normal situation. In physical terms, it may be depicted by a cone resting on it's base. In economic terms, it can be represented by the intersection of ordinary supply and demand curves. If the system is subjected to an external \\"shock\\" or disturbance sufficient to dislodge it from equilibrium, self-corrective forces will cause it to return to it's initial position.\\" Real markets never behave even approximately in this way. Whenever anything likeAdam Smith's hand can be found in the data, which is seldom, it is destabilized by noise. There are no equilibria, much less any stability in finance data, which are so far the best economic data available, for the most liquid markets. I define a liquid market is one where you can approximately reverse the trade over a short enough time scale, as in the stock market when it's not crashing.<br />Real data are shown in exhibit 5 on page 397, where meaningless 'Phillips curves' are illegitemately drawn through a terrible scatter of points that in reality cannot be represented by a curve at all (see also Ormerod's 'The Death of Economics').<br />The text repeats the usual misconception that utility maximization is an equilibrium condition. enough said.

Unfortunately, novels and films not only need not tell the truth but are free to distort it badly. The real story of Almasy can be read on the web, in English or German. He was a German agent, was never captured, had no great interest in women and died on the way home sometime after the war of a disease contracted earlier in Africa. He indeed was an Africa researcher and did write a book, Schwimmer in die W&uuml;ste, about the pictures on the rocks in the desert. Almasy means apple, more or less, his family made money from apple orchards in Hungary and bought the castle, never quite attaining official status as nobility from the Austrian government. So, the film is largely a charming, romantic fabrication, as are most films.<br />Somehow, it is very unsatisfying to be seduced by a book or film and later discover that harldly anything in it is correct.

Second, the cooperation betweeen two very curious, practical-minded intellectuals, Clinton and Greenspan, is discussed, so we can abandon any fantasy that Dubya and his warmed-over ideologues will be good for the economy. Third, and very interesting, the extent to which Greenspan does not rely on neo-classsical economic theory is emphasized. In a nutshell: if Adam Smith's hand existed (or if unregulated free markets had any stability at all) then Alan Greenspan and the Fed would be superfluous. That his hand is needed is qualitative evidence that Adam Smith's hand does not exist.

Arrow<br />The author begins with the key question: why, in orthodox economic theory (neo-classical economics) is math superficially raised to such unwarranted heights while attempts to face empirical reality are so weak? Hodgson presents a stimulating (if too philosophic and also nonempiric) discussion of the ideas of Darwin, Smith, Spencer, Marx, Veblen, Marshall, Mayer, Schumpeter, and especially Hayek. A main question is: in a biologic analogy what, if any, are the economic anaogs of genes, the relatively invariant elements, the 'elementary particles' of a local economic system from which 'mutations' and 'selection' by the environment (the rest of the world economic system) can be understood.<br />Connected with the lack of obvious invariants in economic reality is the question how one can meaningfully divide the global system into 'isolated model equations plus environment.' If nothing can be isolated then it is impossible to discover any rule of mathematical law of time evolution. In particular, we cannot then treat the environment as an external field that 'selects' economically, unless we can empirically-accurately make the arbitrary division into 'system with initial conditions, plus environment'. This is in part a question of time scales.<br />Another problem is the author's confusion over the idea of 'evolution'. For evolution, meaning motion in time, to occur, organic behavior is not required. Every dynamical system has a time evolution operator that generates the trajectory. That mathematical analogs of mutations can be built into continuous time dynamical systems is likely because even certain Newtonian dynamical systems may be capable of universal computational capacity (maximum computational complexity, equivalent to a Turing machine). Therefore it is, at this stage, superficial to believe that the idea of organism is in conflict with the notion of mechanism. Every mathematical model is an example of 'mechanism' (1), albeit not necessarily Newtonian mechanism.<br />Third, (and correctly) implicit in the discussion is that complete reductionism (explanation of biology and economics in terms of quarks or atoms, e.g.) is mathematically impossible (in quantum theory, an Ohm meter has no definite reading, while DNA in nature behaves like a classical computer) and that some idea of hierarchy of description is necessary. But, how to identify empirically the necessary approximately invariant element in order to build a theory of this? Dawkins's idea of the reduction of behavior to genes is badly treated, but we really cannot rule out at this stage that some forms of mental behavior, at least, might be genetically determined, just as some known illnesses are genetically determined. Genetics 'looks like' physics precisely because genes are approximately invariant, like inertial masses. This analogy is not an accident. Mendel was trained in physics in Vienna, not in biology or philosophy.<br />Hayek's extreme free market ideas, usually not to be found in texts in the US, are given two chapters. One chapter is dedicated to his idea of the emergence of spontaneous order, which presumes (without any empirical evidence whatsoever) the existence of a stable, optimal outcome of an unregulated free market (he sketches the history of the emergence of the hierarchy of markets as a possible example). If such an outcome were guaranteed, as Hayek assumed, then we could do away with central banks (and forget Greenspan!), and denationalize money as The Austrian School of Economics advocates. The whole problem of the idea of preferences (utility functionals), however, is that they are neither time- nor path-independent.<br />In general, the orthodox school (and also Hayek) optimizes something or other (utility, or something else) whereas biological systems seem not to optimize anything, rather they are error-prone and error-correcting via gross redundancy (this was discussed mathematically by von Neumann). Maybe biological systems do not optimize anything. Likewise for economic systems.<br />The book is excessively philosophic, in the pre-scientific Aristotelian tradition. C. S. Pierce and John Dewey (who guaranteed that US public schools would be anti-academic, in part by making high schools a continuation of primary education instead of a transition to secondary education (see Hannah Arendt's Between 'Past and Future')).

He criticizes the idea of `equilibrium', widely believed by academic economists but found nowhere even approximately in real economic data.  He argues that, in reality price levels are never determined by the matching of supply to demand. Real markets are always far from equilibrium, so that there are no clearing prices for assets or commodities. Said otherwise, the `graphs' in Samuelson's famous textbook do not represent real data but are merely cartoons invented for inexperienced or uncritical students. Traders know that equilibrium does not prevail. Traders generally do not use orthodox economic theory in decision making.<br />Ormerod's summary of the neo-classical theory (which theory led to the emphasis in the west over the past 15 years to implement free market solutions regardless of circumstances) is concise and clear:<br />1. A free market competitive equilibrium is efficient, demand equals supply, no resources (including people) stand idle or unused.  That is, Adam smith's invisible hand leads to the best of all possible worlds.<br />2. In equilibrium no person or unit can be made better off by altering resources without making someone else worse off (Pareto optimum). That is, redistribution of wealth will make things worse. Indeed, this is the religion of the far right in America, and elsewhere: In this phlosophy governments simply should not intervene at all (Greenspan and the Fed are unnecessary).<br />As is well-known, general equilbrium theory is based on the assumption of perfectly rational agents who foresee the future perfectly and all conform to the same picture of the future (pg. 89). Ormerod's message is that nothing could be further from economic reality than this picture.<br />Ormerod does a nice job, via presentation of empirical data, of demolishing the notion (beloved of governments) of  the Phillips Curve, the idea that there is a simple relationship between unemployment and inflation (ch. 6). He shows that there is no such relationship in the data. He also argues that Adam Smith was interested in empirics and did not advocate a completely unregulated free market devoid of all moral principles, but that economic theorizing was `highjacked' late in the last  century by theorists who ignored empiricism altogether and instead tried merely  to take over the physicists' notion of equilibrium, but without any idea of dynamics and nonequilibrium. Mirowski makes a similar argument about the lifting of the idea of static equilibrium from physics.  Ormerod  lambasts the tendency of academics to prove empirically meaningless theoems, to treat economics as a branch of mathematics rather than an empirical science. Also  criticized is the hokey assertion by orthodox economists that the failure of real markets to be in equilibrium is due to governmental and other constraints, that a truly unregulated free market would approach equilibrium (i.e., the problem of unemployment is supposed to be solved by complete deregulation). The disaster of Russia is given by Ormerod as a good counterexample. The next examples of such disasters may be the entry of former E. block countries into the (price levels of) the European Union.<br />The text propagates some common misconceptions about deterministic dynamics, in particular about detreministic chaos. Here are a few examples: the author asserts that the behavior of a chaotic machine cannot be predicted accurately in the long run (true in nature, completely false mathematically). Analogs of phase plots (Poincare sections) are misinterpreted as showing evidence for stable  cycles (elliptic points). Certainly, in contrast with what the author expects, there are no elliptic points indicated in the data that he shows (ch. 7). The search for unstable cycles would require data of high decimal precision and cannot be decided on the basis of merely staring at a scatter plot. `Linear' is confused with `mechanistic', as if chaotic and/or complex could not be mechanistic. Scientifically, we do not really know how to distinguish `mechanistic' from `organic'. Perhaps there is no real boundary in nature. These are, in context, relatively minor criticisms of a book that does a good job of emphasizing the flaws in neo-classical economic theory when compared with economic reality.s (Poincare sections) are misinterpreted as showing evidence for stable  cycles (elliptic points).

Ms. Jacobs is not hampered by orthodox preconceived notions, misleading postulated theoretical myths like utility optimization, rationality, or efficient markets.  These standard phrases of neo-classical economic theory cannot be found in her book. Instead, and although her discussion is entirely nonmathematical, she uses a crude qualtitative idea of excess demand dynamics, of growth vs. decline. Her expectation is never of equilibrium. The notion of equilibrium never appears in this book. Jacobs instead describes qualitatively the reality of nonequilibrium in the economic life of cities, regions, and nations.  She concentrates on the surprises of economic reality.<br />Jacobs argues fairly convincingly that significant, distributed wealth is created by cities that are inventive enough to replace imports by their own local production,  that this is the only reliable source of wealth for cities in the long run, and that these cities need other like-minded cities to trade with in order to survive and prosper. Her expectation is of growth or decline, not of equilibrium. If she is right then the Euro and the European Union are a bad mistake, going entirely in the wrong direction. As examples in support of her argument she points to independent cites like Singapore and Hong Kong with their own local currencies. Other interesting case histories are TVA, small villages in France and Japan, other cases in Italy, Columbia, Ethiopia, US, Iran, ... .<br />The book begins in the chapter \\"Fool's Paradise' with discussions of Keynsian economics and Phillips curves (the Philips curve idea is demolished convincingly by Ormerod in \\"The Death of Economics\\"), I. Fisher and monetarism, and Marxism. These were all ideas requiring equilibria of one sort or another. Also interesting: her description why, in the long run, imperialism is bound to fail, written in 1984, well before the fall of the USSR. Her prediction for the fate of the West is not better. Jacobs is aware of the idea of feedback and relies on it well and heavily. She is a sharp observor of economic behavior and is well versed in economic history. This book will likely be found interesting by a scientifically-minded reader who is curious about how economies work, and why all older theoretical ideas (Keynes, monetarism, ... ) have failed to describe economies as they evolve.<br />I'm grateful to Yi-Ching Zhang of the Econophysics Forum for recommending this book.the long run, imperialism is bound to fail, written in 1984, well before the fall of the USSR.

I read this book in spring '88 and discovered inadvertently that I had played a mild, beginning version of 'the hitchhiking game' with my German girlfriend in 11/87 on our last night together before she returned home from the US. We, by our challenging and persistent playing against each other, generated an instability that nearly led to an agreed upon split-up. Fortunately, one of us regained control and stopped the game before it was too late (it lasted only minutes in this case).This was a pure psychologic instability having nothing whatsoever to do with politics or eastern mentalities.

I've rarely enjoyed a book more, primarily because I was able to read it in very general information about the roots of part of my family, colonial era German-Americans living near persent-day Bristol, Va.-Tenn. who migrated over the Appalacians into Harlan County, Ky., around 1800. Wust describes the migration of the Germans down the Shenandoah Valley, settling the Allegheny side and leaving as remnants 3 isolated Va. German-speaking villages (non-Mennonite) even today. We did not visit those villages, but according to a Mennonite harness-maker in Dayton, Va., two of them still existed at that time. This is not something that you can learn about from official tourist info centers. Many of the German family names mentioned by Wust still exist in E.

Samuelson's name was not on the cover and at any rate should not cause the price of the book to increase... The current price makes the book unattractive. Now for my review of the softcover version:<br />This is a relatively well-written undergraduate-level text that can be read/understood without the need for classroom instruction. It is especially useful for self-study by ordinary people who know nothing at all about finance theory but are motivated to learn. The reader will find all of the main topics covered: cash flows, efficient market hypothesis, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), risk management, hedging, and options pricing at Black-Scholes (B-S) level of discussion. In the spirit of the simple level of the text, the B-S equation is applied but not derived (best derivation is still the second one, and the Black's original method starting from the CAPM, in the famous 1973 Black-Scholes paper). `Fat tails' (known and largely ignored since Mandelbrot, 1962) and non-risk-neutral hedges, the frontiers of modern finance theory, are not discussed.  Throwing the traditional `financial-engineering' bone in the direction of fat tails, implied volatility is discussed because in practice fat tails can't any longer be ignored. All in all, the book is recommendable to physics grad. students who want to learn finance terminology along with the main (wrong) ideas believed by the finance theory community.  As an example of the book's weaknesses, the authors assume that the vague,  undefined notion of `fundamental value' makes sense, and that liquid markets are in some vague, undefined sense `efficient' although the notion of a relaxation time is never mentioned. Typical finance theorists' shortcomings aside, this book can profitably be read before (or at least parallel with) Hull and other harder texts on derivatives. Liars' Poker and Fiasco can also be read profitably in parallel with this book. No knowledge of neo-classical ('marginal utility') econ (as is excesively taught in Samuelson's standard text) is required, and is at any rate is useless for finance theory/practice.rder texts on derivatives.

The idea of short-circuiting physics is charming but dead wrong.

Samuelson, quoted by Berstein)<br />Bernstein has written a fascinating pre-LTCM (pre 8/98) book on the history of econometrics and finance,  beginning with the origins of the Cowles foundation as the consequence of  Cowles' personal interest in the question: Are stock prices predictable?  This book is all about heroes and heroic ideas, and Bernstein's heroes are  Adam Smith, Batchelier, Cowles, Markowitz (and Roy), Sharpe, Arrow and  Debreu, Samuelson, Fama, Tobin, Samuelson, Markowitz, Miller and  Modigliani, Treynor, Samuelson, Osborne, Wells-Fargo Bank (McQuown, Vertin,  Fouse and the origin of index funds), Ross, Black, Scholes, and Merton. The  final heroes (see ch. 14, The Ultimate Invention) are the inventors of  (synthetic) portfolio insurance (replication/synthetic options).<br />This  book consists largely of a pre-LTCM (pre-10/98) cheerleading for  option-pricing mathematics based on lognormality, and corresponding  synthetic portfolio insurance. Osborne and Mandelbrot are mentioned. The  book is not error-free: e.g., Mandelbrot's ideas on stock prices are stated  as being the origin of chaos theory (!), and Mandelbrot (of random fractals  fame) is misportrayed as an `articulate proponent' of chaos theory! Another  error (page 182): \\"..persistent forces are constantly driving the market  toward (Modigliani-Miller) equilibrium.\\" The evidence for the EMH is  supposed to constitute the `proof' for this nonsense. So much for `proofs'  in economics. So ingrained is the false, misleading and inapplicable notion  of \\"equilibrium\\" in the minds of economists that it is hopeless to expect  to educate them out of their own morass. Even Black, who was educated as a  physicist as an undergrad, did no better:<br />\\"When people are seeking  profits, equilibrium will prevail.\\" (F. Black, quoted by Bernstein)<br />Among  the interesting and entertaining stories that are told are: the  displacement of Graham and Dodd's `value theory' by the EMH, the  revolutionary role played by Wells Fargo Bank in using the `new finance  math', and in creating index funds. The importance of the Miller-Modigliani  `theorem, which `proved' that the (not-uniquely-defined) `value' of a  corporation is independent of it's debt. Then, there is the wild-haired  idea of `portfolio insurance', how to eat your cake and have it too (a free  lunch, derived from the assumption that free lunches don't exist). No  portfolio can be insured against extreme deviations, especially those that  occurred in 10/87 and wiped out confidence in LOR  (Leland-O'Brien-Rubinstein Associates). But this failure of finance theory  produces no crisis for Bernstein, whose book is the history of heroes, not  villains.

I found the second half of this book to be better than the first.<br />Professor Shiller emphasizes two points: (1) US  Stock prices are overvalued, and (2) stock prices have been driven high by psychological  feedback. I've made the same speculation in my recent article The Futility  of Utility, where I've pointed out that gambling in the market is  essentially different from mechanical acts like tossing dice or drawing  cards: the amount of betting on a stock determines a buyer's success or  failure in the latter case, but certainly not in the former one.<br />The  weakness of the book is the first claim, that stocks are very much  overpriced. In support of that point he presents an impressive graph (pg.  8) of  P/E vs. time from 1860-2000 that shows that typical market P/E's  were around 25-35 just before the big US market crashes, historically, and  that the present market P/E is around 45. The difficulty with the viewpoint  is that he assumes that \\"value\\" makes sense, although he doesn't define  \\"value\\" of a stock. Unless we can more or less uniquely define \\"value\\" we  can't say whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced. This is a serious  problem that has not been solved either by neo-classical economics or by  modern finance theory. We would all likely agree that Intel at 30 would  look cheap these days whereas Intel at 200 would not look cheap, but what  is the \\"true value\\" of Intel?<br />I have argued in Futility of Utility that  \\"Value\\" is undefined because it is not unique. Like the notion of price as  a function of demand, it is a bad idea, both theoretically and empirically.  Professor Shiller seems to have in mind the old pre-theoretical finance  (pre-Osborne, pre-Black-Scholes) idea of dividend-discounted stock prices  when he speaks of \\"value\\". This is a dead idea, still taken seriously only  by a few professors within the academic economics profession. It's a  useless notion because (1) no one buys stocks for dividends, and (2) it's  impossible to define the idea of dividend-discounted price, because even  next year's expected return is random and complex enough that it cannot be  known or accurately estimated in advance. It is very easy to give at least  three more definitions of \\"value\\", none of which agrees with the other  three (see my larger review of Shiller's book on  the June 2000 web site  [...] What is missing in the book is pinning  down the real reason why stock prices are historically high, and why  business activity is at such a high level. My uneducated guess is that it  has a lot to do with the amount of money in circulation, much or most of it  credit-originated in one way or another.<br />Professor Shiller doesn't like  traders. In his ideal world there are only rational long-term investors  willing to settle for 3-5% a year, or whatever the rational market produces  (people with enough money can certainly afford that luxury, and typically  buy bonds). The book ends on a Spenglerian note, reminiscent of the  Arrow-Debreu program in neo-classical economics and Merton's program of  inventing hidden options: Professor Shiller wants to monetize a lot of  stuff. In his rational world (part 5, \\"A Call to Action\\"), you could short  Houston's booming housing market, the Japanese economy, the US economy, or  whatever else you might want to choose.

It begins well with doubt that the notion of Adam Smith's hand is scientific, presents a brief and interesting biography of Fischer Black, and generally takes up  where Liar's Poker leaves off: with LOR's idea of portfolio insurance. The  CBOT history is described, as well as Black's love of the CAPM and (one of)  the economists' (wrong) notions of \\"equilibrium\\" along with Black's  suspicion of the `no arbitrage' argument. Exactly why he was suspicious is  left out, but the firming of the no arbitrage idea in the Miller-Modgliani  `Theorem\\" is hinted at. The history of LTCM is first-rate. Among the more  interesting parts is the connection with UBS and the investment in LTCM by  the Bank of Italy. Also interesting: how LTCM went beyond `sigma' and the  lognormal distribution by considering local fat tails (which still ignore  extreme large deviations). Also stressed is that liquidity was always  assumed, an assumption that fails during very large deviations.<br />Those who  have taken the trouble to read Spengler's last chapters in The Decline of  the West  will enjoy Dunbar's description of the old Arrow-Debreu program,  and the philosophically-related program by Merton and his students) to  discover/create hidden options, the attempt to capitalize everything  everywhere.<br />There are some claims that are irritating. Feynman's idea of  the path integral is given credit for stimulating LOR's transition from  continouous time Brownian motion to summing over discrete branches on a  tree, whereas in reality the path integral applies directly to continuous  paths in both quantum mechanics and (as Wiener showed earlier) continous  time Brownian motion. In Brownian motion theory \\"drift\\" is confused with  diffusion. Statistical independence is confused with randomness. Fama is  cited as the originator of the ideology of the efficient market as the  underpinning for Bachelier's theory (true), but Samuelson is given credit  for applying the lognormal distribution in finance.

After reading Bernstein's Capital Ideas, a cheerleading book for lognormal finance theory, which gushes over heroes, I had high expectations for Jacobs' criticism Bernstein's viewpoint. But Jacobs' sole argument  seems  to be that portfolio insurance was a bad idea, and he repeats it too often.  Many chapters are simply too repetitive and were written as if they'd been  cut and pasted from different badly-written review articles. Even though  the book is post-LTCM (post 10/98) most of the book is taken by with  attacking of LOR's pre-1987 idea of portfolio insurance, while the far more  fascinating and more recent case of LTCM and the near collapse of the  global finance system is hardly discussed.

I read this book four years ago, so this is what remains of it as a shadow of my original impression. Sure, it's a very strong anti-war story, but what else is it? Prerequisite is Palm Sunday, where Vonnegut explains the  origin of his interest in Germany and Germans. Billy Pilgrim is a symbol  for all of us are aware and insecure enough to feel disconnected because we  have no roots (our connection to old pre-immigration culture has vanished).  If you find this book hard to read then maybe you have no such trouble to  be American today: you're not 'unstuck' because you fit. People who feel  unstuck from modern consumerism and all its idiocy might say that they feel  like they're from some place else, like 'outer space'. Anyway, following  the Holocaust and also the far less important but still very sorrowful  allied destruction of medieval architecture in Germany, the ending of the  book in Dresden is believable-the old Wirt worrying that people need food,  drink, and shelter and offering it. Sister book/complement to Schlacthof  Funf is Mother Night, where maybe Vonnegut imagines himself on the other  side-? I was in A-burg when the opera played Schlacthof Funf in Munich and  didn't bother to go. I had read that Vonnegut didn't go because they  invited him AFTER constructing and planning the opera, but not before.	2000-02-21

My resolution shows that both Varian and Mirowski were partly wrong. Mirowski is right in one sense: when dynamics is taken into account in the theory of production then the generic case (nonintegrable dynamics) is that utility is a path-dependent functional, and so doesn't exist mathematically as a function of demand. In this case (as Osborne observed from empirical data) price as a function of demand does not exist (the 'cartoons' passing as graphs in Samuelson's textbook can't be constructed from real market data). Varian was wrong: the most trivial integrability conditions are violated in this case because utility as a function cannot be postulated but either exists or doesn't according to dynamics. On the other hand, Mirowski was wrong that an analog of kinetic energy, or even a conserved quantity, is required. Utility is not, as Mirowski believed, analogous to potential energy: it is analogous to what physicists call the action. When optimization-control dynamics (Hamiltonian dynamics in econometrics) is integrable, then the action is a function, not merely a path-dependent functional (see Liouville's integrability theorem, ca. 1880, also discussed in 1916 by Einstein in the context of why Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization fails).	2000-02-17

Instead of taking the cue from the collapse  (10/98) of Long Term Capital Management and producing something new and  more interesting, Malkiel keeps on giving us warmed over versions of the  same old EMH (efficient market hypothesis), which many researchers by now  know is wrong (Fisher Black &amp; Co. knew it in the eighties). Malkiel's  beloved 'back of the envelope' calculation showing large how stock price  changes can be caused by small interest rate changes is also irrelevant,  because it assumes that dividends determine stock prices, and everyone in  the market knows that dividends haven't mattered in the last ten years, at  least. The 1996 edition (3 stars) is informative. There, you can learn what  beta is, and the example discussed of using covered calls as a conservative  strategy is also nice.	2000-02-13

Unlike (nearly all, or all) academic economics  books, which 'explain' that arbitrage does not and cannot exist, Lewis explains to us how the big bond houses live from arbitrage (buying low from the government or  somewhere else and selling a bit higher to you and me). The book is a rare,  a highly entertaining and very informative jewel: Lewis rightfully and  poetically calls brokerage houses 'full servive casinos', far better than  Monte Carlo or Las Vegas. Not only will they accept and place your bets,  they'll also lend you (a large fraction of) the money needed to place your  bets (margin)! A very good book to read now (1/27/00) during the 'wild  ride' before the present big market bubble goes: POP!<br />Unfortunately,  Lewis tells us too litlte about Meriwether, who later seduced two of the  top finance academics (they were willing) and, with their aid, constructed  the huge, uncontrolled experiment in 'equilibrium theory' called 'Long Term  Capital Management' (LTCM). Their philosophy, also believed uncritically by  most working economists, was and likely still is: Equilibrium will prevail  (even in the absence of restoring forces!).

The book has also proved very useful to me in life. As a graduate student I used Poincar&eacute;'s implicit `advice' (described in the book) in the following way. In electrodynamics we had a long problem sheet to hand in every two weeks. I started by writing down answers to all problems that I knew. Then, I thought about the next-easiest problem each day walking twice to and from the University (about 1 1/2 hours altogether). When the answer came I wrote it down and iterated the process. Before the end of two weeks most of the problems (from Jackson) had been solved. Poincari's advice is very good about giving the unconscious a chance to work.

Therefore misses the main point: in  optimization problems (Hamiltonian dynamics), price as a function of demand  or supply ('price equals gradient of utility'), and utility itself, do not  exist unless the Hamiltonian dynamical system is Liouville integrable (see  my paper &quot;The Futility of Utility&quot;).	2000-01-25

Having spent many moons walking around in Oslo since that time, I can  report that Sult describes very well the feeling of isolation that one can  easily experience there, a Munchian existence that goes well with  &quot;Skreiken&quot;.

This book is interesting, worth reading, in part because of it's attempt to avoid moralizing and to find instead `mechanical' reasons for economic slumps, and also for its presentation of facts about sequences of events. The book is also short: the presentation and arguments are concise and easy  to follow. The mechanics emphasized by Krugman are large (often leveraged)  money transfers and leveraged credit. The examples discussed are about  Japan, Thailand, Mexico, Russia, and Brazil. Money transfers via hedge  funds are nicely discussed.<br />Japan, seen from a western economist's eyes,  presents a problem economy: stable currency and employment (no growth), and  high savings (people tend to keep their money in the bank). Krugman labels  this no-growth/high liquidity state a `liquidity trap'. He describes a toy  economy that provides a model of a liquidity trap, the Washington DC  Baby-sitters' Co-op (see also Akerlof's `Market for Lemons', which came  earlier).  In the baby-sitter's co-op people start with small, equal  amounts of script and a state is reached where parents want baby-sitters  (demand) and other parents want to baby-sit (supply) but there is no  matching of demand to supply because the script supply (money supply) is  too small (savings are too high). Krugman's proposed solution to the  liquidity trap is to inflate the script supply. That is also his proposed  solution for destabilizing Japan's economy and society: to make saving less  desirable by inflating the money supply, therefore inducing people to  consume and speculate. The interesting thing is that on Thursday, 14  October 1999, that is exactly what the Bank of Japan agreed to do by  announcing that they are buying back bonds. So, we now have running an  uncontrolled experiment of Krugman's proposal.<br />Krugman presents elsewhere  a mathematical model of the liquidity trap (see his web page), but it's  based on the mythology of a utility function and is only a static model  with no dynamics and no time scales. Unfortunately, there is really no  correct existing theory of liquidity traps, because `utility maximization'  is not an equilibrium condition and does not predict anything measurable  real  data. As for Japan, one might ask: why label their society as a  \\"problem\\" just because the economy and currency are stable, especially  since people save a lot and there is as yet no large-scale unemployment?  The reasons that they tend to save rather than speculate by buying stocks  and bonds are several-fold: (1) the mafioso nature of Japan's finance  system, where people got burned very badly in the last bubble (see Devil  Take the Hindmost, by Edward Chancellor), (2) high financial friction, or  large brokerage fees (soon to be destroyed by the introduction of discount  brokerage houses into Japan as of 1 October 1999), and (3) the fact that  Japan has no social security system. If we ask why western politicians and  economists persistently label Japanese habits as `problematic', the answer  could well be an unquestioning, bordering-on-dogmatic belief in the  econo-religion of growth and progress by the accusers. French farmers  rebelled with very good reason against European Union demands for  `optimization'.<br />Peter Drucker pointed out in 1983 in The Frontiers of  Management that trade in goods and services no longer determines exchange  rates, that money transfers/month across international borders are many  times the value of exports/imports. This fact, that the size of money  transfers dominates everything, plays a key role in Krugman's analysis. He  replays for the reader the tape from (Thailand, 1997 and) Brazil (fall,  1998) where, with still non-increasing prices, but at the onset of an  economic slump, Brazil's currency came under pressure due to fallout from  the collapse of Russia. Brazil tried to devalue slightly and the currency  was routed (via hedge funds). Krugman poses the general question why, when  a currency (like the Baht orReal) is weak, and the government (either  credit-leveraged Thailand or unleveraged-Brazil) tries to devalue slightly,  the devaluation tends to turn into a run on the currency. The answer, he  asserts, is that this happens because people believe that it will happen,  and this belief then makes it happen  (via hedge funds). In other words, a  self-fulfilling expectation is created. This rings true because it reminds  me of Feynman's observation (in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman) that  socio-economic phenomena are not like physics or mathematical laws of  nature. In the latter belief doesn't count (you can't make it rain by  wishing, and a billiard ball can't think and change its path), whereas in  the social arena you can act on beliefs and then cause things to  happen.<br />Summarizing, in comparison with Krugman's book The  Self-Organizing Economy, where he seems only to parrot ideas that he didn't  invent and doesn't understand (I got this impression in the early pages and  so did not read further), I found The Return of Depression Economics to be  both enjoyable and informative.Real) is weak, and the government (either  credit-leveraged Thailand or unleveraged-Brazil) tries to devalue slightly,  the devaluation tends to turn into a run on the currency.

Krugman was inspired by the idea of self-organized criticality made popular by a certain school of physics, but there is nothing original in his book. He has merely lifted notions from another field that he did not invent and, far worse, doesn't understand. For something much better, and which is at least explanatory and seems to make some sense, try his book 'The Return of Depression Economics'. 'The Self-Organizing Economy' is best tossed in the trash can. I confess that the title of my review is not original, but I refuse to divulge the author in order to protect his privacy.<br />For critical analyses by economists of what is wrong with the basic theory believed by Krugman (and the entire MIT and Chicago schools, the IMF, The World Bank, all so-called neo-classical economics), see Paul Ormerod's 'The Death of Economics'. Like all neo-classical economists, is a utility maximizer, a believer in stable equilibria, but real data (which are always far from equilibrium) show utility maximization to make terribly wrong predictions, not even close to the mark, completely useless except as a way to mislead lawyers and politicians who understand too little to question the results. Also, do not miss reading Mirowski's Machine Dreams-fantastic book!	2000-01-08

Mandelbrot pointed out a year later (1963) that this can't be true, that price distributions look Paretian, have  exponentially decaying tails with infinite standard deviation. However, no  one has yet been able to turn Mandelbrot's observation about asymptotics of  market prices into trading rules (what are the dynamics?). In contrast, the  Black-Scholes model, the mathematics of derivatives and option-pricing,  follows from the lognormal approximation (see Hull, e.g.). Traders who make  money apparently don't use academic option pricing theory (it underprices  out of the money trades), but texts and scads of academic papers are  written using it because no one knows how to do anything else yet.<br />Lognormality is the last part of Osborne's book. The first chapters are  even more interesting. There, Osborne tears the `mathemology' of  Samuelson's Economics text to shreds by pointing out that the famous  supply-demand curve can't be constructed from any sort of data. The main  point is that price does not exist as a function of either supply or  demand. Example: suppose that 25 tomatoes are available (supply). What's  the price? Answer: anything or nothing (nonuniqueness). Even better,  Osborne shows that one can obtain data on both supply and demand as a  function of price, so that discrete (noncontinuous) supply and demand  curves can be plotted for a given commodity in a given market. What a pity  that Osborne did not set his mind to discussing `utility', because (as  Mirowski points out in \\"More heat than light) the differential form that  defines utility is generally nonintegrable, meaning that utility dooes not  exist. Samuelson wrote papers trying to get around this in the 50's, but  the correct underpinning of General Equilibrium Theory was never  established. Osborne rightfully points out that people who believe in the  approximation of continous price changes and efficient markets are grist  for the mill of traders who use just the opposite assumptions to make money  off them every day.<br />I wish that economics students would be required to  read Osborne and Mirowski, but that isn't likely to happen. Meanwhile, the  Fed keeps hiring those guys to crunch questionable numbers using the CAPM  and similar stuff.nd efficient markets are grist  for the mill of traders who use just the opposite assumptions to make money  off them every day. <br />I wish that economics students would be required to  read Osborne and Mirowski, but that isn't likely to happen.

It exposes what is hidden in Samuelson and every other economics text, namely, that the theory of equilibria and utility were merely lifted from physics (Hamiltonian dynamics) without any support  from economic data. What is more amazing is the complete discussion  presented by the author that `utility' doesn't exist mathematically because  the required differential form is nonintegrable. Economists and  statisticians may not be able to undestand this point, but it should be  familiar to researchers in dynamical systems theory. The inventors of  marginal utility theory, Fisher, Walras, and Pareto, literally did not know  enough mathematics to know what they were talking about. Equilibrium can't  be reached in a Hamilton system (there is no friction to permit the  approach to equilibrium), but this contradiction was no worse than all the  others inherent in econo-pseudophysics.<br />This book should be read and  understood by every economics student who reads Samuelson and asks: what  has 'utility' to do with the data. A very good complementary book is  Osborne's \\"The stock market from a physicist's viewpoint\\". Osborne  introduced tha idea of lognormal stock prices (thereby paving the way for  the Black-Scholes equation and derivatives trading). In his first two  chapters, without the benefit of the historic perspective offered by  Mirowski, Osborne explains why the supply-demand curves drawn by Samuelson  are wrong and misleading, and then goes on to illustrate how one could  obtain correct discrete plots real data. For example: if 25 tomatoes are  available (supply) then what's the price? Clearly, there is no answer.  Price does not exist as a function of supply, nor of demand  (nonuniqueness). Osborne goes on to suggest that the three related  assumptions of equilibrium, continous price changes and efficiency are not  supported by the data, and observes that there are traders who make money  out of the inefficiency of the market. Mirowski and Osborne are strongly  recommended to anyone who wants to understand economics.and Osborne are strongly  recommended to anyone who wants to understand economics.	1999-09-19

Because, gripping and chilling as it is, it offers no clear insight into why the woman was isolated, but leaves one with the feeling that it was the disease of society, the isolation of a weak person in the megalopolis.

It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: &quot;It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover.&quot; Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering.dmirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering.	1999-02-25

The weakness of her book is that it is dedicated to what John Berger has called 'the instant culture', the culture where postmodernism has cut us  off from the past while the media cuts us off daily from the future. For a  study of the interaction of the media with the outcast elements of the  instant culture from the standpoint of PC/postmodernism see Joshua Gamson's  &quot;Freaks Talk Back&quot;. Both Paglia and Gamson are TV addicts. Both  praise the role of the media in the instant culture. One is Foucauldian,  the other is not.<br />Paglia's intellectual contribution comes from her  anti-postpodernism. PC is an instant-practice in postmodernist society that  creates/spreads the pseudo-disease called victimization. America has,  through PC, become a nation of victims. See also &quot;Dumbing Down our  Kids&quot;, by Charles J. Sykes, for the role played by schools in creating  'victims'. Paglia's anti-postmodernist essay 'Junk bonds and Corporate  Raiders' is worth reading because it's a very effective attack on  postmodernism/PC, and predates the Sokal hoax by about five years. Her MIT  lecture is also worth reading. The rest of the book, in praise of the  instant-culture created by modern capitalism, which has largely destroyed  the chance of nontrivial culture within America, includes a lot of  horn-tooting for Paglia by Paglia and does not shed light on anything worth  knowing. Paglia likes to emphasize her Italian roots, but the stark  contrast with John Berger's writing, where peasants do not behave as  victims and capitalism is not praised for what it has done, is worth  noting.	1999-02-24

The book was limited, but what it did it did relatively well. It was brief but  clear, well-written, did not introduce too much of the usual mythology in  discussing 'wave-particle duality' (I liked the discussion of the two-slit  experiment), and went on to present the introductory ideas and mathematics  of quantum mechanics in an attractive way.

The  weakness of the trilogy was Lilac and Flag, where no solution was offered  and the ending faded into pseudo-religious mythology.

Per Bak has a record as one of the best, most stimulating physicists of our age. However, I am not happy with the idea of SOC and do not count it as among his best work. The weakness is that universality classes for sandpile models (and complex adaptable systems) have never been defined. Without universality classes one cannot claim that an arbitrary mathematical model (like a sandpile model or a 'complex adaptable system') describes or explains anything in nature. One or a few scaling exponents do not define a universality class for systems away from criticality. There is no evidence, to date, that turbulence, economics, and most other phenomena that occur in nature or society are critical phenomena. Socio-economic phenomena surely do not obey any invariant laws of motion. I suspect that the best that one can hope for is a model that maybe works temporarily and then fails because moods and behavior change, like the Black-Scholes option pricing pde.	1999-01-20
