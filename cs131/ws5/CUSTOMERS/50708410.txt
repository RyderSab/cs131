Actually the top 3/4 of it is a regular picture book of Finding Nemo, with only so-so illustrations.  The 3-D pictures are on the bottom part, & are only about 2\\" big.  It's hard to get the viewer lined up right to see it, & even when you do, it is a very poor 3-D effect.  This book was a waste of money.	2005-08-10

Sequels by other authors are often very disappointing.  After reading the prologue I was hooked.  I read it all in a day & half.  There are many interesting books in the world, but not enough books that you don't want to put down & can't wait to see what happens.  This is one of them.  I was trying to tell someone about the plot, & just saying it out loud, it doesn't seem like it could work.  But it does, & wonderfully.  This book is just pure fun, one of the most enjoyable books I've read in quite a while.  Anyone who likes pirates should read this book.	2005-08-01

There were a few that were real \\"stinkers\\"; like a rapunzel one where a computer genius escapes his captors by climbing out the window down his \\"hair\\" computer cables.  And there was one that was very foul involving descriptions of very violent rapes.  Overall I thought it was an ok read, but not great.

There were a few parts that were good enough to keep me reading, but a lot of it was just uninteresting.  I stopped when about 50 pages in there was a very long paragraph describing Shakespeare's mother molesting him.  The tone was one of jocularity, & the description ended with an even more disgusting joke.  If you like to read descriptions starting \\"Mary Shakespeare would take her son's little member very pleasantly in her hands...\\", (that's the cleanest part of the paragraph),  then get this book.  If you are appalled by a jest being made of child molestation then skip this book.  I am throwing it away.	2005-05-16
US	50708410	R31LETCK9B2WZP	0312975856	56919881	The Phantom of Manhattan	Books	2	15	18	N	N	No magic	While this book was well written, it had none of the magic or mysetry of either the play or the original book.  The phantom as a person who makes tons of money on the stock market? Come on! Only one part had any of the feeling of Phantom of the Opera, & that was only a few lines.  And someone writing a sequel shouldn't have to have a huge introduction ripping on the original novel.  Especially if the attempt at a sequel is as disgraceful as this one. <br />Not sure why the author felt like he had to move the time period, & then try to put every famous American alive during that time into the story somehow.  I read incredulous as Roosevelt, famous boxers, Irving Berlin, & Wild Bill made brief appearances.  It really tripped up the flow of the novel. <br />The story was interesting, but if you are a big fan of the musical, especially the romance between Raol & Christine you probably want to skip this book too.  Some of the plot twists really put a damper on that.  <br />And what's up with one character having conversations with God while another is conversing with the Devil?  <br />While I had many complaints about this book I'm only going to mention one more.  I am an avid reader & have never been \\"offended\\" by something in a book.  But I really object to the notion that was repeatedly stated, that a child's \\"real\\" father is his biological father.  The child abandons the good, loving man who had raised him for 13 years to go with a stranger simply because they were blood relation.  And this is portrayed as noble & the right thing to do.  Anyone who is raising step-children or adopted children may want to think twice before having this kind of message in their home library. <br />But if you are just dying to know what happens \\"after\\", don't expect any good mystery, & want to see the phantom become a boring money tycoon who eventually gets redeemed, go for it.  I'm going to toss this book out & be glad I only spent $2 on it.	2005-05-06

The information about parajumpers was mostly new to me & very interesting.  The rescue stories were facinating.  All these sorts of books put in some history, background of the area & people.  Sometimes that stuff gets boring, but that wasn't the case in this one.  The information about Alaska was so interesting I was wishing there was more, rather than skimming to get through it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of 2 complaints.  One is that right in the middle of the last big story, he stops the story to give very long lists of all the gear in the headquarts.  While the wide variety of gear might be of interest, the placement of it in the narrative was frustrating.  The other thing was the author spent a lot of time helping us get to know the parajumpers, especially a few specific ones.  Parts of the entire book were devoted to this.  But in the final, climatic \\"big\\" rescue story, the none of these characters played any part.  I found it odd that the story he picked to describe in the most detail didn't include the parajumpers who the book is mainly about.  But that rescue was a great story as were all the other stories in the book & it's well worth reading.  Impressive group of men!	2005-05-05

While I was reading it, the writing was compelling enough that I was interested & didn't want to quit reading.  But when I wasn't reading, it wasn't a book I thought about or looked forward to reading.  And I haven't given the story another thought since I finished reading it a few weeks ago.  So it's not bad, enjoyable while you're reading it, but nothing lasting.	2005-05-05

There was a bit less grotesque torture.  But I especially liked that the story went somewhere.  Some of the others tended to drag a bit, or seem like they weren't really progressing, with just smalls parts of something actually happening.  We finally get to find out why the Harkonnens & Artriedes feud, & all the other loose ends are also tied up.  I found it quite enjoyable reading, & perhaps my favorite Dune book after the original Dune.	2005-01-13

To make it long enough, most of the book is descriptions & history of the region, & past history about the people on the expedition.  While some of this was interesting, most of it dragged & was hard to get through.  The actualy tragedy was interesting & moving, but was just a few pages of the book.  And then there was the usual descriptions of problems with porters (how many adventure books do we need to read about that?), & the people struggling to make sense of their friend's death.  There were a few mountaineering quotes from other climbers that were interesting.  But over all the book did not flow, was not compelling, & was rather disappointing since nothing really ended up being explored.  As a short story it might have been better.   And while some of the descriptions were boringly detailed, they didn't explain things like basic kayaking or rapids terms that they used.  This made some of the parts that were actually interesting hard to understand for laymen.  I did learn some, but while I usually read all the books I own multiple times over the years, I don't expect to be reading this one again.	2005-01-09

They weren't as sappy as some Christmas stories get, although there was plenty of sentiment.  A few were rather unique.  The illustrations were nice, although not as nice as the front cover led me to believe.  Overall I was touched by the stories & enjoyed reading the book.  It was also nice to have a book without too much focus on death & tragedy.  There was a bit, but I'm getting tired of so many Christmas books being about sad subjects.

Nice to have a Christmas book that isn't exactly the same as all the others.  They tried to make a case for why Christmas traditions are important.  While I am very in favor of Christmas traditions, I don't think their \\"why\\" worked very well.  It was sort of the moral of the story, & it just didn't really ring true to me. I also get tired of stories like this having Santa in there somewhere wanting to \\"give up\\" for whatever reason.  There is magic in this book however, especially the connection to Christmas spirit & music.  So even with the flaws I enjoyed reading it; but it's not up there with my favorites.	2004-12-13

It's put together nicely, but there wasn't much new or unique in the book, except a couple of poems.  There were some nice illustrations, but the book wasn't worth it just for those.  So if you are looking for something new, not just the same old Christmas stories, don't get this book.  But if you want all those in one place this is a good choice.  I also found it a bit hard to read for long periods since it's small, but very thick.  Handling it & keeping it open to read was tiresome.	2004-12-13

Shows that Santa has been around at least 2000 years, & that reindeer do fly.  For any other subject, this book might get boring, but when it's about Santa & reindeer it's absolutely facinating.

It's very loving & reassuring that parents & God will always be there for the child.  I'd definetly get this book.	2003-04-10

I think it's a very good fantasy & good characterization.  I'm 27 now & still read it once in a while.  Love the dragon!  And it's nice to have a heroine killing a dragon.	2003-04-10

I read this for my &quot;restless legs syndrome&quot; who the Dr's could do nothing about.  Haven't had a problem since.  A friend's TMJ worked the same way.  Get this book...it's worth the dollars for the chance of ridding yourself of pain.	2001-10-05

I almost didn't buy it after reading negative reviews but I'm glad I did.  I didn't think it was a cliff hanger any more than previous books were....the &quot;mystery&quot; of this book was solved just not Ramses &amp; Nefret.  And although what happened between them may not  be what we all wanted that doesn't mean it wasn't a possible outcome or  something that shouldn't have been written.  Not everything turns out  exactly how you would like when you'd like it in real life; or in good  writing.  I can't wait for the next one to come out!	2000-04-30

Wonderful pictures by George Hinke including some that aren't in the original &quot;Jolly Old Santa Claus&quot;.  Great spaces for memories &amp; family photos.  This is the book whether you just want wonderful  paintings of Santa or a great memory book for your family's Christmas's.	2000-04-01
