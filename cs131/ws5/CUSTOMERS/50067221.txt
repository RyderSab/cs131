The main character Bullet, a high school track star and an obstinate loner, is a racist. This is all right, as the book is set in the sixties. However, the protagonist does not noticeably change by the end of the book. He has had a new wrinkle put in his ideas about race, but he is pretty much the same personality that began the book. Whether this bothers you or not depends on your idea of an effective story and intriguing protagonist. <br />	2005-10-08

Fiesty tomboy Huda is the narrator who considers herself \\"more boy than girl.\\" She clashes with her parents, particularly her father, as well as other adults in authority whom she encounters, as she resists being slotted into the roles of a young Iraqi woman. In this book, the women are mostly strong, feminist figures, while the men are weak-willed and childish, prone to temper tantrums.  The narrator is engaging and sympathetic. <br /> <br />The only problem I had with this book was the frequent switch from first to second person and back again. That made it hard to follow the rhythm of Huda's narrative.	2005-10-08

She also examines famous feminists'impact including Kate Millett, Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug. The book contains plenty of quotes from anti-feminists, as well, to show (at least in this reviewer's eyes) just how ridiculous if often effective the opposition to the Women's Movement was. <br /> <br />One thing. The author laments that role models in children's literature are \\"few and far between.\\" Either she is making a blanket statement, or she has no experience.

It focuses on three very different girls: straight A Lisa, practical joker Stevie, and horse crazy Carole who become friends after Lisa begins riding at Pine Hollow. At first, Stevie and Carole aren't sure Lisa will fit in, but she soon proves herself to have genuine potential and a desire to learn. When she helps Stevie do a math project to raise her gradese (and permit her to go on a horseback riding campout), the Saddle Club is born. <br /> <br />As a review mentioned, the book suffered by not exploring the characters' motivations. Lisa's mother and Veronica, the stable's spoiiled little rich girl, remain one dimensional.    <br />However, it is hard to believe an author who knows enough about horses to write a book would put an inexperienced young rider (Veronica) on a stallion. <br />	2005-09-28

The woman in question, Isabel Flood, is humorless, prim and intolerant under the guise of tolerance. In addition to the cast, is F.X., the sisters' enigmatic uncle, who takes a perverse delight in opposing Isabel. The narrator Penny is Mahalia's younger sister, an inquisitive, rambunctious child, who clashes with Isabel's attempts to babysit her.  <br /> <br />The girls join Isabel, Mahalia willingly, Penny unwillingly, as she goes from household to household spreading her own peculiar gospel. What causes the most uproar, is her campaign to have a poem about abortion removed from the local school's syllabus, and in doing so, opens both girls' eyes in a way she probably does not intend.   <br /> <br />One quibble: Penny seemed a little too precocious, even for a typical precocious child protagonist.	2005-09-27

Like \\"The Saddle Club\\" it has a young rider on a black stallion, and also like that book, an inexperienced rider. This would never happen in real life period. In the book, the rider learns dressage, a kind of fancy \\"ballet\\", by sitting on the horse, in reality, the horse would need an experienced rider to produce it.  <br /> <br />The characters are likeable, but the ending is just ridiculous. Here the girl, who's barely in her teens and not too knowledgeable about horses, earns money by renting out the stallion to her classmates. She's punished, but eventually she gets to ride the stallion again, and it's hinted that eventually she'll have enough money to purchase him. This is just absurd. In real life, people worry about things like getting sued, and they certainly don't shrug it off when they find that someone has used their horse without their permission. The whole plot was just too ludicrous for a real life horse lover to swallow. <br />	2005-09-21

Stevie begins training for eventing. Carole and Ben make slightly more progress in the romance department, as do Lisa and Scott. Callie begins once again to enjoy Scooby after she gives George a restraining order. And there is a devastating fire, but I won't give away the end.<br /><br />Some nitpicks about the horse aspect of the series.<br /><br />1. With the breeds I'm familiar with, the horse receives its name at birth and it is registered under that name. That is also the show name. While the rider can nickname the horse anything he/she wants, there is no way for the rider to change the show name/registered name on the spur of the moment, as was portrayed here.<br /><br />2. At most stables, different ages ride together. Age does not denote experience level. All beginners aren't in elementary school, all intermediate riders aren't in junior high, etc. In real life, people take riding lessons alongside people of different abilities (though similar). Time constraints demand this. Also all teenagers don't suddenly stop taking lessons and train their horses mostly themselves, though they may have permission to ride independently.<br /><br />3. Callie is an endurance rider. Wouldn't she want a stable with a coach that specialized in the sport? In none of the books does she have a lesson with Max or anyone else, except for therapeutic riding. Is it realistic for someone at the top level of competition not to need a coach, regardless of experience?<br /><br />4. People who can afford fancy gadgets and purebred horses aren't all rich snobs. Even the snobs that I've known aren't anywhere near the ones portrayed here. Nor are people who compete at the highest levels mostly rich snobs either. That's just an unfair stereotype.<br /><br />5. Stevie, Lisa and Carole in a much earlier book experienced a terrifying barn fire firsthand. Stevie, especially, risked her life to save the horses. With that in mind, it makes no sense that fear of being a tattletale would keep them from alerting Max to a real problem in his barn. And if Max is around enough to give lessons and supervise the stable, wouldn't he eventually figure out that Maureen is smoking at the barn? He's not supposed to be that clueless.d, it makes no sense that fear of being a tattletale would keep them from alerting Max to a real problem in his barn.

In doing so, he meets a girl his age, grappling with her own demons. The existence of a mythical sea creature \\"The She\\" which may or may have not been responsible for Evan's parents' deaths is debated for the entire 300 plus pages. While intriguing at first, this quickly becomes tiresome. <br /> <br />The protagonist Evan is smart and good looking and rich and belongs to a clique of Rich Spoiled Kids With Seriously Weird Names. In fact, Evan is the only character in the book with a normal name. I couldn't help but feel that this added to the soap opera effect in the book. <br /> <br />The climax is intriguing, but none of the characters are particularly likeable, and some are downright obnoxious. The book begins with a good premise and a hilarious opening scene but quickly goes downhill from there. Think \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" with a little \\"Ordinary People\\" thrown in for good measure. <br />	2005-08-22

In it the main character is pretty, sexy, intelligent, resourceful, etc., etc., as well as sexually appealing to every single character of the opposite sex regardless of how inappropriate this is. The character may have a single flaw - but nothing that interferes with the pretty, sexy, intelligence. The author goes to exhaustive pains to make this clear to the reader. <br /> <br />This is such a book. We learn over and over and over that the character has a sexy body (she's 14) and is pretty. Why? Who knows? Maybe the author was in love with her himself. We get descriptions of the character's body ad nauseam. In very little time, I longed to throw the book across the room. <br /> <br />There isn't much action, just traveling from different Modes, but nothing really serious in the way of danger. The heroine deals with some painful memories by reliving them, and the way they are described seemed unnecessarily graphic. If you ask me, the writer wasn't sure whether he was writing a porn novel or a sci-fi/fantasy book. <br /> <br />The other characters have little distinguishing traits (except that they are Good or Evil, but always, always in love with the protagonist). The resolution with the parents and the protagonist was too good to be true and really read like a bad fantasy scene in a teen's imagination. <br /> <br />Over all, I found myself thinking: Who cares? Repeatedly. <br /> <br />Skip this one.  Please. <br />	2005-08-06

First off, many self-injurers (cutters) are NOT suicidal. They may be depressed and angry and abused, but cutting can be a way to hold on, not let go.   <br /> <br />Secondly, no girl who has just been raped would \\"smile\\" and permit a couple other guys to rape her. I'm not saying she would or wouldn't resist, but she certainly wouldn't act as if the boys had just done something mildly offensive. Does the whole thought of rape turn the author on so he can honestly not imagine a girl enjoying it or at least pretend to? It seems so. <br /> <br />Also, I found the character of Colene rather bizarre. In one scene, she's writing to her imaginary horsie, the next she's performing a striptease and slicing up her arm. If a girl really had all those sexual experiences, she'd be too jaded to believe in imaginarry horses. Take it from a former young horse lover. No girl that extensively sexually abused/raped would care one way or another about imaginary horses - unless perhaps she was very young. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-24

High IQ and good looking individuals were recruited, although their claims to being superior specimens would not always hold up years later when they were met by their surrogate children in person. Indeed with lax security (and journalists like the author) it was possible to bridge the gap and contact one's donor. Results, as you might expect, are varied. <br /> <br />Although some of the derision and disgust toward the donors and their families was justified, I felt it should not have been so marked. While it is easy to lose your professional distance writing about people who are by turns moving and repelling, I thought the author should have contained himself. <br /> <br />It did not seem to me that donating sperm gave him a more understanding and empathic view of those who did. Instead it simply gave him a sense of inflated self-importance because he was told he had superior sperm. While pride is understandable, I felt it should have been omitted, as it detracted from the stories of the donors and their families. <br /> <br />What was moving, however, was the story of the elderly donor and his \\"granddaughter,\\" and the conclusions several children came to that it was the heart not the brain that ultimately influenced how worthwhile an individual is. As the author points out, advances in gene technology now make it possible to screen for various characteristics of the fetus, and more are in the works. Sometimes it's the \\"soul\\" that gets lost in the process. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-19

Voldemort has preoccupied Harry since the events of the last book, and he is even more determined to take revenge, especially, as it seems like his archenemy Draco is going over to the dark side. <br /> <br />Much of the book is backstory on Voldemort's life and how the prophecy came about. There's also a new wacky teacher to puzzle out, heightened Hogwarts' security, Quidditch, and a harrowing journey in order to retrieve a curse.  <br /> <br />The excess of adverbs that plagued the fifth book is gone, and Harry grows into a considerably more mature adolescent by the end of the book: he puts away \\"childish things,\\" and makes decisions as an adult would. I had to admit, I was disappointed that Neville played such a minor role, especially after his heroism and backstory in book five. <br /> <br />One thing that has always irked me, bugged me here: If Dumbledore is really a superior headmaster, why does he constantly overlook the most minor evil-doings and neglect to put a stop to them before they escalate. Some of it is that Harry doesn't confide in him, but here he's aware of it on his <br />own and chooses to do nothing. But I guess there wouldn't be much suspense and intrigue otherwise.	2005-07-17

It tells the tale of Skif, an orphan and pickpocket, who in Dickens-fashion, is apprenticed to a slovenly and corrupt uncle, then a humane and kind-hearted thief, and finally Chosen and brought to the Herald Collegium to train. Needless to say, he has difficulty adjusting to a place where just about everyone is kind and unselfish. <br /> <br />A conflict arises when Skif's Faginish mentor's house is burned and he is killed. Skif sets out for revenge, and as the man's misdeeds extend far beyond his imagination, he eventually gets aid from the Heralds, who wish to wipe out such a scourge in their city. <br /> <br />I was annoyed by the page after page of indecipherable dialect, and how one character's speech was grammatically correct half the time, and transposed English the other half. It seemed random and sloppy, and detracted from the impact of the character, especially since we were never given any good reason why this should occur.

While many are consigned to less-than-pleasant conditions to grow up in, the narrator Kathy and her friends are fortunate to attend Hailsham, a boarding school which offers a supportive environment. The students are given limited information about their grim futures and are encouraged to develop their creativity. Kathy forms friendships with two students, Tommy and Ruth, which becomes a love triangle as they move into adolescence. <br /> <br />As adults, the students spend several years as \\"carers,\\" and then perform four transplants, before being \\"completed\\" i.e. dying. There are rumors that if two students from Hailsham can demonstrate true love for each other than they will be granted several extra years to live together. <br /> <br />How the narrator and her friends discover the fallibility of that rumor makes for much of the drama in the third act. Up until then, they (and the readers) are not given much information as to the particulars of a society which permits cloning, although hints are dropped steadily. <br /> <br />I, too, had a problem with the fact that not a single character rebelled, whether clone or someone from the \\"outside.\\" There has to be at least one iconoclast or one citizen who feels passionately that the current system is flawed or corrupt, for a book about a dystopian society to have true drama. Although this book was engaging and well-written, it fell short by not having a counter-critique. <br />	2005-06-19

I did enjoy the first two books in this series, and so was hoping the quality would continue in this one. <br /> <br />The book stopped holding my attention after the concert. I was hoping for more details of Eric's (the protagonist) life at Juillard. There were too many secondary characters whose stories went nowhere and who might have been interesting if properly developed but never were. <br /> <br />I also wanted more on the potential challenges of having and raising a child in the Underling, more on Eric's relationships at Juillard (particularly the bastard teacher) and how he resolved his issues there, and more on Jeanette, who literally just rode off into the sunset without any follow-up. <br /> <br />All in all, a disappointing read. Even the battles between the elves and the humans didn't hold my attention. They just seemed redundant and too similar to the first books'. <br />	2005-06-11

I came of age in the same period, yet there is almost no mention of the books, TV shows, movies, pop culture phenomenons, and celebrities of that period that wouuld anchor the book in the nineties. Surely, the girl would have been exposed to more of US culture at her mother's where she lived at the start of the book. Except for the mention of Saddam and oil, the war could be just about any war for all the detail it's given. <br /> <br />That there is no description except of a few things: tampons, a frozen dead cat, baklava, but otherwise is all dialogue. But the dialogue is often so bland, the reader loses track of who's saying what. <br /> <br />That the girl has no interests outside of exploring her body. Even the newspaper job is taken so that she can get close to the lecherous neighbor. At least the Judy Blume heroines cared about religion, sports, normal teeneage stuff, etc. <br /> <br />The cop-out ending. If \\"Daddy\\" is spitting mad that his daughter has run away, he's certainly not going to pay for the child to stay at the neighbor for the prolonged period of time that she does. So where is Melina getting the money for her food and lodging, etc.? She can't be that rich or that generous - no one is outside of books. A real ending would be the child either returning to Dad or Mom, or a foster home under Protective Services. Especially, since Melina's just had a baby. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-08

Then, there are the students themselves: loud, opinionated, grievance-carrying, illiterate, poverty-stricken, pregnant, etc., etc. Next are the teachers and staff themselves, some idealistic, but some cynical and worn out.

This does not end once you graduate and enter the workforce. Frankel in this book lays out the ways women sabotage themselves unintentionally when attempting to get ahead in the business world. Some of these tips, you will have heard before, others will be new. <br /> <br />Women grow up being conditioned to be good, unselfish and cooperative, traits that can both help and hinder career success. They may need help in realizing that this can undermine the impression they are trying to create, and this book does a good job of that. Topics range from \\"Obediently Following Instructions\\" to \\"Grooming in Public.\\" Some suggestions will sound sexist, but are accurate.

Because they were created by men, following them as a woman presents a different set of challenges. <br /> <br />Luckily, Evans lays out these rules in a practical, sympathetic manner. I guarantee that even if you're already a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and surprising. <br /> <br />Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business. Women, Evans argues, are socialized differently and because of this need to be aware of how men have set up the game, otherwise they will continue to be overlooked. That's why a book like this is such a help. <br />	2005-05-29

How do you write one while making sure the reader cannot blame the victim for staying? Well, perhaps the first is impossible, but the second surely isn't, and this book is proof. <br /> <br />Doyle takes us inside the head of Paula, who has found out that her deadbeat husband is now dead. There are hints that she might have had to something to do with his demise, but it's not clearly drawn out until we have learned how horrible he has made this woman's life. Why doesn't she leave, some may ask? Well, she's poor, not well-educated, and has grown up in a family and neighborhood where abuse stays behind closed doors. However, her struggles first to survive her husband, and then to survive the memories are moving and poignant. <br /> <br />Doyle also lets us the effects of abuse on the children, who have witnessed it, and how the whole family can act in accordance to keep the unsavory behavior of one of their own a secret. While Paula considers herself weak and just muddling through, the reader will likely come to the opposite conclusion. <br />Rather than go on Oprah and confess her problems, she keeps her struggles to herself (and the reader) and in doing so, comes across as incredibly brave, a heroine in every sense. <br /> <br />	2005-05-28

Her father is a romantic man, with musical gifts and a tendency to drink. Her mother is a practical woman, who raises her children with tough love, and works as a janitor. The protagonist, Francie, is part of an extended family each member richly drawn, and as she matures, her world evolves from the stoop of her tenement to school to college and the workplace, all seen with her unique slant. <br /> <br />I first read this book in fourth grade, and it is one that say, unlike \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" matures nicely. What moved me then, moves me now, and the author does that rare thing, gives each and every character his/her humanity. While the book is chock full of \\"Oprah\\" topics, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse and poverty, the characters are drawn as more than their various vices, far more. The protagonist at one point is chided for writing about \\"sordid\\" subjects by her English teacher, yet she quickly realizes that honesty as a writer is more important than fancy phrases and made up fantasies. So does the author. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-28

First, I should introduce myself. I'm a lifelong horse lover/owner/rider who has read a good deal of the equine literature out there, both nonfiction and fiction. <br /> <br />Thus,I jumped at the chance to read \\"Beautiful Jim Key,\\" the story of a horse who performed tricks, apparently based on him having the intelligence of a young human child, and in doing so,  <br />helped curtail animal abuse. A real life Black Beauty, in a way.  <br /> <br />But despite my love of horses and sympathy with the protagonist and his master, I found myself nodding off every time I picked up the book and tried to read. Why? Having an innate interest in the topic and subject, I'm forced to look for reasons that have to do with style and syntax. Too many run on sentences? An over-fondness for adjectives and adverbs? I'm not sure. I'd still give this book to a horse lover as a gift, but with reservations.	2005-05-25

She has grown more (both literally and figuratively) than her two siblings put together. I also like how each of her utterances is not just baby talk but expresses an actual thought, albeit sometimes in a different language. <br /> <br />The only thing that kept me from fully enjoying the book was the Captain's habit of ending each sentence with \\"Aye!\\" I don't know why exactly, except that such constant exclamations felt like being rudely poked in the eye. <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

I'm sure the author's pointing out that sociopaths exist in every profession, including the psychology field, did not make her popular with her colleagues, and I admire anyone whose work is based on seeing others as \\"sick\\" is willing to admit that sometimes the physician may need more help than the patient. <br /> <br />The case studies/composite portraits were intriguing, and made me see past encounters with certain people in completely different terms. Having the characteristics of the typical sociopath also made me more confident of how to handle any in the future. <br /> <br />Like other reviewers, I agree that the author should have backed up the 4 percent statistic better, especially since it's repeated often in the book. <br /> <br />Also, the book lost focus towards the end, veering from fascinating case studies to dull clinical data to rather preachy philosophizing about what it means to be human. It could have used some more editing, in my opinion.	2005-05-10

It was called \\"Well Schooled in Murder,\\" and had the same premise (biracial youngster is molested, tortured and finally murdered), although a distinctly different setting. It made more of an effort to get inside the suspects' heads and portray them as if not downright sympathetic characters, than certainly less repulsive than the ones in this book. \\"Well Schooled\\" was also shorter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I'm all for curling up with a massive tome, as long as the author takes pains to make me care about the plot and the characters. <br /> <br />I, too, was dismayed at her decision to kill off a long running major character, but she as the author has the final say. What I objected to was how random the death was, that it apparently had no bearing on the main case, and I also thought it should have been placed anywhere except near the very end. Because we've known the character from the start, her death eclipsed the intrigue of solving the case. <br /> <br />And, minor point I know, but I could not quite believe that Barbara's neighbor would leave his eight-year-old daughter alone to babysit herself. Wasn't this the same child who was kidnapped and flung overboard into the sea a few books ago? Unless the man's supposed to be a sociopath, this strains credibility.	2005-04-29

Still, I wish this book had: <br /> <br />Given a sharper definition of \\"middle class.\\" There is a world of difference between \\"lower\\" and \\"upper,\\" middle class, especially attitudes toward the mental health profession.  <br /> <br />Held HMOs partially responsible for the mess the mental health care system is now in. True, there are assembly-line shrinks out there that do their patients little good. But many are handicapped by managed care that pressures them to prescribe drugs in lieu of long-term, in-depth therapy. Therapists must now justify and document their patient's every visit. As for over-diagnosing, every patient has to have a label in order to have their insurance kick in. It's not done to dehumanize the patient but to ensure that they'll get treatment. In a lot of cases, mental health workers have no choice. <br /> <br />Also, the family as an institution is not precisely the same as a school or a drug treatment facility. While parents should certainly be taken to task for neglect, and kicking their children out, I got the sense the author was applying these same standards to the other institutions the teen subjects felt had \\"betrayed\\" them. A principal who receives a death threat (to use an example) should certainly expel the student. One would hope the safety of the other students and staff would take priority. A principal is not betraying anyone by doing this, but I got the sense that the author was as equally disturbed by this act as he was by the parent who kicked her child out. <br /> <br />I was skeptical of some of the subjects' claims that they had managed to make through their youth without encountering a single supportive adult. Many were described as good students at some point, excelling at athletics or community service. It seems odd that they never once received positive reinforcement for these things. Surely there was a relative, teacher, coach, pastor, etc. at one point, who encouraged them, however briefly. <br /> <br />One last thing. I wish the subjects had had a bit more insight into why they started their self-destructive behavior and why they stopped. Too often, they made it sound like they woke up one day and decided to kick the habit and go back to school. Someone reading this might be tempted to think their behavior was just a phase, did little damage (most subjects are now in college), and that other teens who are struggling (including their children) will wake up one day, too, and become law-abiding citizens. But these kinds of decisions are rarely made and succeeded at overnight with minimal adult help. More information is desperately needed. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-05

Like \\"chick lit\\" these books are chock full of characters that are more toxic than a nuclear waste dump: shallow, pretentious, amoral, obnoxious and more concerned about a latte spill on their Armani suit than say, the war in Iraq. Most books of this sort take place in a Big City, almost always New York (apparently the only city editors think people want to read about). Is this because most publishing houses are in New York? <br /> <br />I'm curious. Do these authors not know any decent people in New York (which would be a big cliche right there) or is there no market for books which portray the rich as having admirable traits, such as compassion, morals, ethics, and interests outside of their penthouse? Or is this the hopelessly naive view of a non-New Yorker?  <br /> <br />The book tells the story of a comparatively \\"average\\" family of three whose teen daughter is applying to high school. This is supposed to be very nerve-wracking, except there is inherently no suspense for the reader, once we learn that Mom and Dad have \\"ins\\" at all the schools the child wants to attend. Mom is a composite of every obnoxious parent you have ever wished to slug for her 100-percent irony-free sense of entitlement. Though it doesn't quite come to this, she is the type who would perform sexual favors if it would get her child into the school of her dreams. Her husband, who we see too little of to get a sense of how he feels about the admissions process, is far too passive, and would likely stoop even lower than he already does to get the child into school, if his wife browbeat him into it. <br /> <br />The child herself is sympathetic only her problems are buried under an avalanche of over-the-top characters. This is the kind of book where the type of shoes someone buys is supposed to pass for character development. The stereotypes, such as the child's gay best friend, are truly offensive. The child's current school is supposedly diverse and PC, but it is only \\"15 percent nonwhite.\\" Personally, she might be better off in a public school, but of course, that would not qualify as a happy ending. <br />  <br />  <br />    <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-04

Usually, if the equestrienne character is hostile toward people, she's redeemed by her genuine love for horses, but not this \\"heroine.\\"  She half-kills her mare and recovers in just a few pages - which as a horse lover sure endeared me to her. The other characters are equally as unlikeable; the only decent main character (Daisy - the brat's mother) is such a doormat that you wind up wanting to slap her upside the head rather than root for her. (I did like her dog Ethel and her cat, as well as most of the ponies. At least, the author throws you that bone, pun intended.) <br /> <br />This was the kind of book where everyone's outfits were described in intricate detail, and their motives were spelled out the moment we met them (the author's motto seems to be tell not show). If a character's hostility was due to not being hugged as a child, the reader doesn't have to work too hard to figure this out. <br /> <br />Every time someone entered the story, whether or not we'd seen them before, we learned what color their outfit was. Cooper is very fond of colors - emerald green, baby blue, scrambled egg yellow, Pepto Bismol pink (just kidding), etc. After awhile this became tiresome.  <br /> <br />Still something kept me skimming after reading the first two hundred pages. I just think it would have been as equally good a book if it were about half the length. None of the skimpy plot would have had to have been sacrificed. To the author's credit, she provides an extensive list of characters and a brief description (my favorite being \\"Bridget Macleod, Hamish's mother, an absolute bitch\\").

It's refreshing to see an author create a first novel protagonist who clearly isn't some idealized version of herself. <br /> <br />I just wish the author had prefaced each section with a date - it took me a needlessly long time to figure out when it was set. Characters used today's lingo (hook-up, etc.), but there were also elements specific to both the 80's and 90's. This was a bit jarring. <br />  <br />	2005-01-22

Well, those made the characters in this book look like Mensa members. Actually, there are no characters here, just caricatures. I grasp that this is supposed to be some kind of \\"fun, trashy read\\" but that is no excuse for sacrificing plot entirely. By the time I read 50 pages, I still didn't know what this book was about. I'm not entirely sure the author did either. I got the feeling that she just kept putting description after description of beautiful people, intermixed with the occasional bawdy joke in front of her until she filled up the designated number of pages to qualify it for a \\"book.\\" <br /> <br />Do you like people screaming at each other constantly about totally minor matters? A huge cast that is gorgeous and rich but not in the least intriguing? Children who pitch a fit when they can't watch porn? Then you are going to LOVE this book! <br /> <br />Apparently, this book is a bestseller in Britian. Obviously, there is a culture gap here. A big one. <br />	2005-01-18

The three main ones are Michael Carradyne, described as \\"a very manly sort of man,\\" the trainer/owner of the stable, who cheats on his wife not only during the marriage, but when she's in hospital and also right after she dies; Selina Healey, who like Michael has a monstrous spouse that she is unfaithful to; and Michael's daughter Catriona, who at least is too young to start copying the infidelity of her elders.    <br /> <br />Oh, and all three are beautiful, well off and superb riders. With the child, we get hammered with her perfection page after page. About the only thing she does wrong is because a stablehand tells her to, and this is sort of laughed off when it's discovered, because well, she's perfect. She can ride better than anyone except the dead grandfather. Plus her mother was a horrible you-know-what when she was alive. Case closed. <br />  <br />The only character I felt sorry for was the soon-to-be dead wife of Michael. And I only felt sorry for her because all the other \\"good\\" \\"sympathetic\\" characters hated her, and her husband trots off to a horse show the moment her funeral is over. <br /> <br />Frankly, I was appalled at the behavior in this book. I don't think you can excuse someone's moral shortcomings by their superb riding ability. Not here anyway. <br />	2005-01-14

What's the message - Don't sleep with the office cad and that other women will routinely stab you in the back? That nonstop humiliation (including sexual) is the only way you'll eventually succeed in your chosen field? Maybe this makes sense in New York, but elsewhere it doesn't apply or hold up. <br /> <br />Too bad publishers and agents can't grasp that the majority of young women do NOT wear Prada, do NOT live in New York and would maybe like to see their own lives reflected in the books they pick up. Then again, most of them live in New York, and probably do wear Prada. <br />	2004-12-19

Both were similar, however: delinquent, wild child girl with artistic aspirations meets nice sensible boy who's trying to find an escape hatch to progress beyond his humble origins.  While I felt the author did a good job with Ben, at times I felt that she didn't have any more of a handle on Lara than the Lara character herself did.  Though this may, of course, been intentional. <br /> <br />A few things bothered me: Was it really necessary to make such a point of saying that Ben had no tack? Nothing in the way she presented the riding school people led me to believe that they would care if he simply borrowed some (surely they need it for the riders without their own mounts?) Nitpicking? Perhaps.  <br /> <br />Also I wish the writer had bothered to nail down what time period this story took place in. Going on the clothing and speaking style, I assumed it was in the present, and (guess I'm getting really nitpicky) I couldn't figure out why Lara wouldn't use the Internet to track down her birth mother. <br /> <br />Then and again, I think way too much about these things, and I liked the book.	2004-12-14

Although the story was intriguing, I felt it could have been compressed without removing any of the suspense. Also, the several shifts to the horse's viewpoint seemed to come out of nowhere, and several times I lost track of how old the main character was now and how much time had elapsed between crises. At one point, the bad luck being piled upon the horse was more than I could bear to read (especially when his pony companion was stolen). But what a gutsy heroine and her triumph seemed earned all the way. <br />	2004-12-12

BUT, they are also quite sentimental and cliched, so this book in some ways outclasses them. <br /> <br />Perhaps the fact that I have read so many books where the abused horse and rider heal together and then win the blue or the Olympic gold made me less receptive to this book - as others have said, I had trouble figuring out where the story was going, as it did not fit your typical \\"National Velvet\\" plot. I also wished sometimes the main character would start to get her life in gear sooner, but then maybe that was due to all the terminally plucky and tough horse heroines I have been exposed to since childhood. <br /> <br />But the horse is intriguing, and the fact that he and the owner DON'T beat all the snobs at the county show is worth the price of the book alone. <br />	2004-12-05

Obviously, the annointed Ms. Smiley can do no wrong in the critics' eyes, but even before I learned about the conservative-bashing that awaits me further on, I did not have a high opinion of this book. I found much of it dull, disjointed and vaguely annoying. Perhaps she should have chosen her equine anecdotes a bit more carefully. It's cute the first time she consults a horse psychic for her steed; the third or fourth time, you start getting this picture of a spoiled owner with way too much time and money. I love horses and horse literature, I just didn't like this book. <br />	2004-12-05

If they wanted to write it for their kids, why did it have to be published at all if it was of this poor quality? In the dedication, they mention their agent who decided to buy the book despite neither having any idea where it was going. Any other unknown writer wouldn't have had that encouragement, and it's a shame that the finished product still feels like the authors were - pardon the bad pun - very out to sea with \\"Peter.\\" <br /> <br />It would have helped immensely if the writers had chosen to focus on the child characters more closely - after all, they are the true heroes, not the bawdy pirates, however much fun those characters were to write. Instead, we lost sight of them for chapters at a time. Imagine this effect in a \\"Harry Potter\\" book. <br /> <br />Despite these criticisms and some sloppy editing, I felt the book had promise, if only the authors had sat down and really thrashed out where they wanted the story to go and how they wanted it to get there. <br /> <br />I feel like a traitor writing this because I have always been a huge fan of Dave Barry's newspaper columns and humor books. Still, I am baffled by the amount of 5-star reviews here. I hope they are all seeing something I so plainly missed. <br />   <br />	2004-11-30
US	50067221	R28ZM1E8X59NRO	0375401466	160007841	Old School	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	funny and meaningful	Very differently written than \\"This Boy's Life\\" but more perceptive, \\"Old School\\" tells the story of an (unnamed) narrator who attends a prep school which places major emphasis on literature, sponsoring a yearly writing competition, which even the less literary students enter. (We should all be so lucky.) The three writers who are invited to visit campus and give a private meeting to the winner of that year's contest are Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and finally, Ernest Hemingway. Great portrait of a writer's coming of age. <br /> <br />As the narrator competes and witnesses these writers, he adopts then discards their worldviews, as he comes to terms with the facade he has adopted in order to fit in with his more wealthy schoolmates. His final entry, while perhaps the most dishonest act of all, winds up winning. And, we learn, after the narrator has left the school, the misunderstandings and facades extended to the staff, as well. The most hilarious section is Ayn Rand's, but there is plenty of subtle humor throughout.     <br />	2004-09-23

His three pals warm to the task, but the narrator is repelled by the outcast, especially after he senses that the boy is more manipulative and rebellious than he lets on. The boy also has an uncanny ability to ferret out secrets and weaknesses that others would prefer to keep hidden. When he uses this power against this group of friends, tragedy ensures, in a very Y2K way.  <br /> <br />Unlike one reviewer, I did not find the profanity gratuitous but used for effect in very specific scenes. However, I did feel the author at times was trying to hard to be colorful, coining the kinds of phrases that are used in movies like \\"Clueless\\" but not (often) by real life teens. <br /> <br />	2004-09-23

Unfortunately, despite having perceptive insights and unique comparisons, there was much that was repeated from her earlier books, as well as a rather dense mat of imagery and quotes to get through. While I might use it to get a grip on some concepts raised in an introductory psychology class, the unending imagery and run-on sentences made for hard going and rather thankless reading for pleasure. However, if you love D.A.'s writing, you might want to give this book a shot. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-23

Holden Caulfield tries valiantly to connect with people, but usually only succeeds in alienating them. Also, there are cracks in his facade, cluing the reader in to his deteriorating mental state. <br />Stella, the main character, of &quot;Panda&quot; is his opposite number. The reader gets very limited access to her mental state, and as she seems to effortlessly move from task to task before ending her life, we are left in the dark as to why she is going to do this. Apart from her foster mom, she improves her relationships if anything as she manages to charm her teachers and principal into overlooking minor misbehavior, and makes - dare I say it - a friend. She is not locked into any one path, and has a chance to delay college. Though she quits an acting class, she must indeed be a first class actress if she can carry off &quot;normalcy&quot; so well. Many people who end their life are depressed, and it is impossible for a depressed person to feign interest in their surroundings so perfectly. (At least I think so.) <br />I also agree with reviewers that said that the drug dealer boyfriend and the outburst from the foster mom came completely out of left field. Stella never explains why she and the guy broke up - which might be an important clue right there. And the foster mom thing seemed added because the author was trying to shoehorn in some &quot;drama.&quot;<br />The character of Ainsley was the most fascinating to me. I wanted to know more about her, as she was the least stereotypical of the cast. Stella, in comparision, did fit into that &quot;angsty teen&quot; mold, despite some uniqueness.	2004-07-18

The author does a superb job of capturing the mindset of someone pushed to cross a line most of us believe we could never cross. How &quot;The Event&quot; colors the protagonist's life afterwards is anything but predictable, and there's a second twist near the end, which I won't give away. Neither nature or nurture alone is an adequate explanation for the crimes committed which makes the story even more provocative. The reader might even find themselves thinking it could plausibly happen to them in the same situation, always a mark of a good author. It's grisly though, in places, so I would not recommend the book for the squeamish.	2004-07-07

In every case, Ackerman doesn't just observe, she gets right up close, in some cases risking or sustaining injury. She catches crickets, tags seal pups, and presses bombardier beetles to see them spray a warning. (All this is done under the eyes of experts in the various fields.) Her descriptions of the habitats are, as usual, beautiful but real enough so that you are transported right into these remote locations with her. By simply describing the work of those who study and handle the animals, Ackerman reminds us how important it is to preserve what's left of their habitats, always worth emphasizing.	2004-07-07

The reviews here call the book tedious, irritating, haphazard, etc., yet they obviously found something to savor in it. Alas, I am not one of them. Perhaps it was the writing style that did me in, as I am not familiar with the author's other books. But I do think most memoirs benefit from having at least a rudimentary linear format. This book was like what the mind may do before you fall fully asleep - it plays hopscotch and images, people, places, etc. all tumble about willy nilly. I don't think imposing a more straightforward format on your memories necessarily destroys the beauty of them. It's just common courtesy if they're going to be out there for the public to cnosume.	2004-07-04

I never understood the fascination this game held for the (mostly male) players, but having read this book, I have a better understanding.<br />This is the first book I can recall reading that deals with any kind of young performer where the parents were not the driving (pardon the pun) force. Instead, the author explores the impact a non-pushy parent, one who leaves the decision to excel up to the child, has on their kid. What may be surprising is that this style can have its drawbacks and inflict its not-always-subtle damage, as well as the more familiar type of coaching.<br />The book charts several years in a youth's life as he learns about golf, not only from the &quot;gentlemen&quot; he plays with, but from the caddies he works with. As the reviewers mention, he also uncovers the ugly underside of the game, and what happens when dirty little secrets are revealed very publically.<br />If you're a non-golfer, some of the terminology can be a bit confusing, but the book is worth a read.	2004-07-04

Others did not produce the desired result of the first, and instead of continuing playing med roulette, Smith stopped his and began the examination of his disorder that is recorded here. The author has no personal vendetta against the Western therapeutic institution, nor does he spend much time lingering on the disappointment of having the meds fail him. Instead, he takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of mood disorders from  familial, historical, literary, and Eastern angles, to name a few.<br />He also describes what he learned from the mental health clients he works with, as well as his girlfriend. Smith does not shy away from describing several incidents that do not put him in the best light, and this paradoxically made me like him as narrator more.<br />Although some authors of depression memoirs have explored their moods from a historic or literary viewpoint, this one is the first I have read that weaves it into the narrative so richly.	2004-07-04

For example, if you take this account as true, Cobain was something of a bully himself in school, he didn't sleep under a bridge,and Courtney Love tried to discourage, rather than facilitate, his drug abuse.<br />The book incorporates interviews from just about everyone you can imagine who knew or knew of Cobain, mostly the former. Although some of the material could have been omitted without decreasing the impact of the book as a whole, it is still a mostly intriguing read.	2004-07-04

What if you found yourself fitting in with your peers to the point where you were singled out and prized for the qualities that helped you do this in the first place? What if you camouflaged your insecurity and fears so well, that you were taken for someone entirely different than who you were or wanted to be? Such is the dilemma of the 14-year-old protagonist of \\"Inventing Elliott.\\" Formerly bullied at his old school, Elliott becomes first a bystander to the same type of violence at his new school, and then chosen by the leader of a secret society to become one of the behind-the-scenes orchetrators of the bullying. It isn't until this begins to jeopardize his relationship with his first girlfriend, that Elliott stops simply reacting to the events around him and begins to make his own decisions.<br />What distinguish this book from other similar novels that deal with the impact a powerful secret society has on a school, is the dimension of Elliott's family life. His father is recuperating (poorly) from a mugging, and this gives Elliott's reaction to being bullied a somewhat different angle.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-07-04

However, while I admire her for her willingness to try any dish (even armadillo!), I wish less had been in about her various affairs. While I may be overly judgmental, I found her ruminations about her love life distracting and irritating. While the author is an adult, I just felt like she should have concentrated more on her professional life. When she sticks to food, Reichl is on more secure footing, I think. When she is wondering about her lovers, the book takes on a more teen magazine feel.<br />However, I had to hand it to her when she finally decides to stop being manipulated by her mother.

Such distinctions matter to Peck (as well they should) and I was pleased that he took aim at the back patting that apparently many book reviewers indulge in. Also, any reviewer that had the audacity to criticize writers like Rick Moody, who many reviewers seem not so much as to critique as hyperventilate over, is okay in my book<br />However, I found the truly amusing remarks sadly few and far between, in their place were a ton of quotes from the books under attack and quotes from book reviewers about the books and quotes from the reviewers about the reviewers who were reviewing the books. Just kidding about the last. But it seemed that way. I think that anyone who picked up &quot;Hatchet Jobs&quot; would be the kind of reader to have a working familiarity with the books criticized already, making many of the quotes superfluous. Anyway, that style of writing is like reading a term paper - no matter how witty - which is not the easiest style to enjoy away from academia. <br />I do appreciate Peck's willingness to expose himself in this way - and as a novelist himself, he is definitely inviting vitriol the next time he publishes. He is very, very witty when he wants to be, I just wish there had been a little more consistent wittiness.	2004-07-04

Much of the pleasure of reading it comes from comparing your own relationship with your cats, both past and present, with the women interviewed and the author herself.<br />Among the topics explored are: why are women/cats stereotyped so harshly and often similarly; why cat hoarders are so often female and why they do what they do; the mythical and historical connections between women and cats; how cats treat our significant others and what that says about how we feel about them (and how we let them treat us); letting go of our cats when it's time for them to pass on; and how our cats choose to communicate with their owners.	2004-07-04

I wish there had been another character I wanted to root for, however.<br />The detective storyline is pretty standard. What distinguishes it is its main character whose disorder threatens to defeat his attempts to solve a murder case at every turn. This may not be enough to keep some readers' interests, but if you're interested in psychological twists, this one is as impressive as any I've come across.

The author does not anthropomorphize Lizbeth which is the best decision he could make. Rather than a heartwarming story straight out of &quot;Touched by An Angel&quot; we get a complex picture of his world: the various hitchhikers, Good Samaritans, petty bureacrats and lost souls who, through reasons besides simple irresponsiblity, happen to find themselves on the streets. Luckily, the chronicle has a happy ending, but it feels earned and not fake.	2004-06-19

However, I felt, for the most part, that the quality of the new pieces did not measure up to the old. It wasn't necessarily the abundance of four-letter words, but what it was (or wasn't) exactly, I couldn't quite put my finger on. I suppose you could say they felt more tossed off. If it's true, as a reviewer said, that the new authors are angrier, that's intriguing. Has nothing been accomplished in a decade, or are women just less shy about demanding change? I wish I knew.<br />I did like the new essay from the woman who attended Smith as a Francis Perkins Scholar (I also went to school in that area) and was forced to also jump through the demeaning hoops of the state welfare system. Also interesting was &quot;Class Feminist&quot; - I'm not too (sadly) surprised that a teen would be ostracized for assuming that label, but that a teacher would by her colleagues....<br />And I didn't think there was that much male bashing - but then, I am female.	2004-06-19

It simply focuses on a segment of the population which is often misunderstood or marginalized. A book on gifted adults is no more elitist than say, a book on adults with ADD/ADHD or a book on adults with learning disabilities. Well, I suppose the tone could be elitist in another book, but this one is mostly made up of interviews with gifted people from all segments of the population who, despite differences in background, have experienced startlingly similiar experiences in school and in the workplace. The tones vary considerably, depending on the subject.<br />Some people's brains work faster, just as some people are born with an amazing ability to throw a football or make a basket. Yet funding sports and rewarding athletes isn't considered &quot;elitist&quot; just these people's due for having these gifts.<br />Anyway, this book is not advocating massive social change so that gifted people can have everything their way. It focuses more on personal solutions than political. In fact, noting that many gifted people are idealistic, the author and interviewees both recommend finding ways to use your gifts to benefit society and connnect with others, yes, even the &quot;non-gifted&quot;.	2004-06-19

The authors interviewed subjects and came up with a handful of traits common to most people considered eccentric. They also learn that it can't be chalked up either to nature or nuture. (Sometimes even the most chance remark can help propel a child onto that path.)<br />While obviously trying not to romanticize their subjects, the authors did conclude that the eccentrics were some of the happiest people they had met.

Unlike that book, however, &quot;The Wilder Sisters&quot; lacks subtlety and depth when it comes to its characters. While appealing, their differences are exaggerated to their point where they almost (but not quite) become stereotypes. While I certainly couldn't begrudge them their ultimate happiness, I couldn't help but wish it revolved a little less around men. This isn't an insult, but I would be very interested in seeing this turned into a Lifetime Channel movie. It seems tailor made for a two-hour TV movie, the kind you can curl up and watch on a rainy weekend with a friend.	2004-06-17

The only drawback was how angry I got that a quality education like the one Whitney offered was available to so few. <br />Hume does a great job of sketching about half a dozen students in depth, and others in slightly less depth. There are stressed students, laid back students, supremely organized students, students in serious trouble, and many who fall in between. We learn of the sacrifices required to keep up in classes; many of these teenagers are carrying a workload that would make a regular working adult blanch. We also meet several memorable teachers, one of whom boldly decides to try working without a net. He allows his students to develop an experiment on their own for the entire semester, then test it before judges. The results are somewhat unexpected.<br />Another section deals with Neil Bush's (George W's brother) visit to the school, and his failure to get the students enthusiastic about his new program. Reading this book, it is hard to tell if the students or parents put the most pressure on the kids, but clearly it's a certain personality style that flourishes at Whitney. The students' informing Bush that subjects should be rigorously pursued to his bafflement is priceless.<br />The only problem came when the author swerved away from describing the students and teachers at the school, and began giving background on how Whitney came to be. That was the weakest section. <br />Luckily, the focus switched back to the students. While it is true that many seemed somewhat stressed, so too are students at less rigorous schools, and when it crosses the line should be decided on a case by case basis. Are teens really happier with a flourishing social life and less academic rigor? I think it depends on the teen.	2004-06-17

It IS possible for a Christian to be a liberal with a wicked sense of humor. <br />Lamott isn't afraid to present herself in a less than flattering light whether it's secretly hating her mom or yelling out of frustration at her young son. We all do these things, but most of us prefer to show the world the &quot;good&quot; side of ourselves. Lamott is wonderful when it comes to making the everyday petty irritations of life funny, so that you empathize with her rather than judging. <br />Lamott writes about children, her friends, relatives and church. She writes about the competitiveness that can develop among parents of young children, and she writes about the path she took to becoming sober. Unlike some reviewers, I don't think it's going to be detrimental to her later relationship with her son when she makes him go to church. There could be a lot worse things she could force him to do. <br />In one essay, she writes about feeling unattractive after standing with a group of teenage girls waiting for a bus back to her hotel. Then she realizes that no one in the group is probably satisfied with her body, and this is something I've started to tell myself when I find myself in that kind of situation, too. <br />This atheist gives this book two thumbs up.	2004-06-17

Many are mono-maniacs who put themselves on elaborate regimens of herbal and energy-boosting supplements, but not all are so focused. Some have other interests, some spend most of their time inside poring over word lists and memorizing strategies.

That she not only found the courage to heal but to report her father to the church is a remarkable testimony to what good therapy, support, one's dedication to their craft, and personal determination to heal can do. The author's brothers were likewise abused, and wound up dealing with depression and mental illness. That the author's piano lessons first served as a bargain between her and her father, as a bribe for not telling about the abuse, makes her journey both as a professional musician, a writer, and a human being especially poignant.	2004-06-13

Instead we are introduced to people, who for all their issues, want the same things from life as more normal people - to communicate, to have their stories heard, to find love, and ultimately, to connect. Perhaps the most interesting is a woman who suffers from the most unglamorous illness of all - depression and whose brief lifting of mood and return to &quot;ordinary&quot; life is all-too-short and the more heartbreaking to read about because of it. These subjects come across as real individuals, not just freaks. And at the end of the book, we learn why Slater possesses such empathy - she knows the country from more than a clincian's viewpoint.	2004-06-13

It is also a tribute that the writer herself does not come across as &quot;only&quot; an enabler or a doormat or a victim of a woman with an insatiable need for love and attention.<br />While the reader certainly wonders just what holds the bond - since Patchett offers very little dissection of what - for example - makes her visit eight stores early in the day to procure for her friend a bottle of apricot nectar - it's clear that Patchett is one of those rare people who can continue with her own career and social life while at the same time caring for Lucy. She comes across as having far more discipline and maturity, but as she notes, the ant may need the grasshopper to give her life balance. Perhaps it also helped that Lucy seemed to know how to balance her own demands among her huge circle of friends, at least up until a point.<br />Patchett writes at the end that her &quot;mistake&quot; was thinking of Lucy as a survivor. That's not really a mistake, in my view, as perhaps no one is really capable of accurately gauging the survival capacity of another. I hope she has passed out of the guilt period of her grief by this time, perhaps this book was one way of helping her do just that.<br />Given what we learn of Lucy from this book, I think she might have been more upset to have herself painted as a suffering saint in this book than have some of her less than flattering characteristics aired. The last thing she seemed to want was to have people define her solely in terms of her illness and operations, especially strangers. Though it may be presumptuous to say so, I think she would approved wholeheartedly of &quot;Truth and Beauty.&quot;	2004-06-11

Yes, this book has some bad words and sexual situations - it's a novel not a column run in a family-friendly newspaper. And its intended audience is adults' whose books occasionally have bad words and sexual situations - regardless how many young people enjoy Dave's columns. Otherwise it would be a different section of the bookstore.<br />Anyway, it's very funny. No one can or should be able to make the reader howl on every single page, but \\"Big Trouble\\" does a fine job of entertaining. If you've seen the movie (worth checking out) it's very loyal to the book: same characters and most of the funniest situations are kept in. <br />Plot: Roughly eight to 12 characters wind up interacting in a kind of convoluted manner to describe well here - a pair of teens playing \\"Killer\\" with a water pistol wind up inadvertenly messing up a hit man's plan to kill the dad of one of their classmates - whose maid winds up falling in love with the narrator - a homeless man called Puggy. Meanwhile the target of the hitman winds up facedown in a bowl of dog chow squirted by a poisonous toad having hallucinations that involve Martha Stewart. Eventually, the dad of one of the teens winds up hijacking a plane - which finally wins his son's respect. A bomb which passes with impunity through an airport check is finally diffused and - well, why not read the rest? I promise it's funnier than just a brief description here can make it.	2004-06-06

In a torrential-at-times rush of prose she describes a youth spent dealing with her mom's and schizophrenic brother's odd behavior - due to mental illness - which was never named, explained or treated with much compassion by her hyperactive, determined-to-succeed-at-all-costs father. Swados shows herself as a young child, imaginative, resourceful and creative, who managed, after a self-destrucive period, to develop into an imaginative, resourceful and creative adult. Her brother, Lincoln, especially comes alive for the reader, as a budding writer and cartoonist whose schizophrenia was never adequately treated (due in part to Lincoln's own obstinence) who later died. Swados' job from childhood on, she tells us, was to be the well child, the success her father could tell stories about to his friends. She well describes the toll that took on her. Yet there is much love and compassion, among the occasionally hurt and bitter memories. Recommended.	2004-06-06

As expected with a Godwin book, we also meet a host of fascinating secondary characters - from the &quot;Pastel Patter&quot; an overly nosy college dean's wife, to the wife's adopted child, an obstinate young teen who is dealing with the loss of both her puppy and her name (changed from Crystal to Elberta).<br />Godwin paints each character brilliantly as a fully dimensional human being with both flaws and strengths.

The main surprise is that the author recalls her camp days as the happiest of her youth, and goes to lengths to avoid coming home or having her parents visit. Though she begins at a young age, she isn't homesick - and her descriptions of the camp make it clear why. The camp offers the more traditional activities, along with theater, and Indian lore, and Arthur takes us intimately through the camp's counselors, activities and physical layout. We're right beside her as she describes skinny dipping, taking a hayride, searching for the Klondike Stone (a camp legend), and we feel acutely the bittersweetness of the end-of-camp banquet  which has given her &quot;a permanent phobia about people being nice to me.&quot; <br />There is little cattiness or competition with her fellow campers, and though her days could hardly have been as unbrokenly idyllic as described here, we do believe, with her, that being a camper there &quot;made her one of the blessed.&quot;	2004-06-06

Many writers have taken as their subject matter oddball upbringings, eccentric family, and the feeling of being a perennial outsider, but most come across, at least part of the time, as too self-deprecating and too unaware that they aren't the only ones with these problems. Not so here.<br />In one essay, Sedaris writes about wanting to emulate a cool boy in his grade, even though that kid bullied him, and ends by admitting that he continued to wonder about him long after they parted ways. Most writers would try to end on some note that they've learned their \\"lesson\\" but Sedaris effortlessly avoids such pat conclusions. Because of this, even the most personal of the pieces can never be labeled as \\"naval gazing.\\" <br />If anything, some of the pieces have enough emotional wallop that their shortness is frustrating. Particularly, I wanted to know if and how he ever reconciled with his father, who threw him out of the house (without explicitly saying so) for being gay. But then, I'm not the writer here.<br />I found this book to be more mature than the previous two. There is still plenty of almost-too-unbelievable family anecdotes and gross-out descriptions, but for reasons I can't fully explain, the essays seemed to move beyond just mugging for laughs.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-05

While I'm not a fan of multiple narratives, this book uses the device effortlessly. Each of the four sections is narrated by the victim's mother, the victim himself, the man who molested the boy, and the wife of the child molester. Somehow you manage to feel sympathy for all. Not to sound sexist, but the male author gets the two female characters exactly right, something that not many authors accomplish. Each narrator has a distinct voice, something else that can be tricky, judging from how many books fall short of doing this.<br />The child molester himself is presented as complexly as the other main characters, a man who tried to eradicate his urges through extensive therapy, but who ultimately failed. And the boy himself, whom we hear from as adult, has reactions that may surprise the reader.	2004-06-05

Even if you don't like her book, you'll have learned something about what you don't like &quot;and that's a gift of sorts.&quot; Luckily, I enjoyed &quot;Starting From Scratch&quot; immensely, although I would have to quibble about the necessity of reading the lengthy book list at the back, and learning Latin (although I have taken it in high school).<br />Anyway, the book is divided into roughly three sections. First, is Brown's autobiographical sketch. (She's one of the few writers who don't appear to blame their parents for their current miseries.) Second, is the nuts and bolts of writing, and finally, the topics like finding an agent and writing for TV, etc. <br />What makes this book different from other writing guides is that Brown frankly addresses the problem (and prevalence) of substance abuse with writers. While I shouldn't quote her directly on the topic, it's clear that she has ample scorn for writers who try to live up to the stereotype of the heavy drinker/drugger. She also addresses the need to take care of one's body nutrition and exercise-wise, which is pretty hard to argue with.<br />Her writing is pithy and makes even grammar lessons hold your interest. Worth a read.	2004-06-05

Freudians, drug docs, behavioralists, insurance companies, you name it, it's taken aim at here. As the young protagonist attempts to negotiate the various psychiatric schools and their devotees, there are suicides and unsavory sex scandals and more. Not being a doctor myself, I preferred this book to the \\"House of God.\\"<br />My favorite part concerned the over-prescription of Prozac and other antidepressants of its class. I have been prescribed it by docs who don't know me from Adam and whose ignorance doesn't trouble them in the least. Shem may be over-exaggerating some dangers, but when it comes to many of the situations portrayed in the book, he's dead on (no pun).	2004-06-03

But it can also promote violence against women and help young people cement an offputting sense of entitlement. Parents, teachers and other influential adults who look the other way with a \\"boys will boys\\" attitude can, in fact, do a great deal of harm, and this book shows just how.<br />The author's interest in the Glen Ridge scandal was first piqued when he realized that most of the town apparently supported the boys who sodomized a retarded girl. The girl herself was \\"asking for trouble.\\" The boys would be scarred for life, it was said, having to undergo a trial.<br />The author's investigation uncovered a long history on the boys' part of deviant and inappropriate sexual behavior and bullying to peers and even adults. Despite sporadic attempts at discipline, the jocks were mainly permitted to do as they pleased. Until the trial, that is.<br />The author's sympathies are clearly with the girl, and the reader comes to realize that she is far from the Lolita portrayed by the opposing side's lawyer. In addition, the author uncovers statistics on the correlation between violence and male athletes, even breaking it down by sport. Highly recommended.	2004-06-03

Khidhir Hamza, an Iraqi scientist, was happily teaching college in America, when he was ordered back home. Despite having almost nothing in the way of workable plans, Saddam, determined to develop nuclear weapons, charged Hamza and others with this task. Despite many obstacles, not the least of which was Saddam's mercurial leadership, the goal was reached. But many of Hamza's colleagues were jailed or put to death, causing the author to finally take the bravest step of all - getting himself and his family safely out of Iraq.

Uday, who aspires to be an even more feared leader than his father Saddam, is (was) not exactly a paragon of mental health. Picture living under the same roof with an adult with the hormones of a teen and the temper of a toddler, whose every whim was granted, and you will get some idea of what this author's life was like.<br />Actually, as a double, he was given fairly little to do but took meticulous notes on what it was like to have an up close and too personal look at Uday's reign of terror.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-03

Moore is a genius at the absurd things children say as a matter of course. It's her adults who sometimes seem too much alike - full of suppressed longing, finding humor in everyday absurd moments, and always ironic. It's like they are all cut from the same personality mold. <br />For newcomers to Moore, I would recommend her short novel \\"Who Will Run the Frog Hospital\\" first.	2004-06-03

From the perspective of adulthood, the narrator takes the reader through memories of her childhood and adolescence with a charismatic and capricious chum called Cordelia. Cordelia is a typical girl bully, charming to adults, but alternately sweet and vicious to her playmates. What is interesting is that the roles between her and the narrator are reversed once they are teens. Compared to the vivid world of the narrator's youth, her scenes in the &quot;present&quot; are somewhat dull, but that is a minor flaw. &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; shows that girls don't need today's glossy electronic trappings to torment someone to the point where they feel completely invisible. It also shows that empathy doesn't necessarily result from having been the object of bullying.	2004-06-01

Toward the end, she receives news that her father may be alive after all.

Led by the charismatic and enigmatic Legs Savodsky, the group moves from vandalism and physical acts of aggression to kidnapping, this comes at the very end and is, as you might suspect, the end of the gang as well. Chronicled by the author's stand-in Maddy Wirtz, a former &quot;good girl&quot; who is going against (she tells us) the long ago warning not to tell anyone about Foxfire's affairs.

Some essays are penetrating, insightful and well-written; others are in need of editing - they read more like a magazine piece, a draft of one that is. There are many dead-on descriptions of what it is like to exist (you don't exactly &quot;live&quot; during depression) with a mood disorder. However, the essays are long on description - however well done - and short on conclusions. Though this isn't necessarily a drawback, depression being such an intensely self-absorbed ailment to have - the writers draw no or few parallels between their mood disorders and the bigger world out there. And warning - few end on a very positive note, though again it is probably dense to expect otherwise. But this does make for a very claustrophobic reading experience. Just don't read during a deep depression, and you'll be okay.	2004-05-30

Especially, since she is a journalist and in the public eye (as I am, but to a much lesser degree), I admire her bravery for &quot;coming out of the closet&quot; so to speak. As she (and I) found there are a LOT of people out there grappling with a mood disorder and taking medication (cracks about Prozac notwithstanding). <br />The book is unique because Thompson shares her unglamorous but effective tools for dealing with depression (after therapy and medication have been established). I, too, suffer from horrible perfectionism and it was heartening to read that this writer was able to overcome at least some of it and go on to have the life she wanted. Sharing the messy side of depression isn't what makes this book different, but that the author was able to take a long, honest look at herself and begin to make steps toward change was. Bravo.	2004-05-30

Eminently quotable - though not exactly the easiest volume to tote along to the beach. I especially enjoyed the essay on &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; and the two on the bestsellers of today and yesteryear (I admire him for slogging through all those books that did not age gracefully and even more for admitting that he just could not get through several.) Unlike Ebert - who is a potato chip kind of movie critic easily absorbed but with no lasting nourishment - Lane's reviews often sound a deeper truth about how absurd the movie business - and society - is. It is especially fun to watch him taking aim at sacred cows and cherished pop icons alike. Ayn Rand, James Michener, Robin Williams, The Bridges of Madison County, and many more - watch out.	2004-05-30

She is capable of some amazing descriptions and gives the subject of a young girl with Tourette's syndrome a poetic touch. But the characters are almost all stereotypes, and the understanding shown toward the girl seems too good to be true for the time and place the book is set in. Of course, she does meet her share of mockery, but those who love her achieve an unnatural state of acceptance and peace - yes, they should in an ideal world, but this is a time where no info on Tourette's was available.<br />While it is possible to tell a story by painting everything in primary colors, the reader eventually begins to long for some shades of gray.

There was scattered humor in its pages, but it was all-too-rare.<br />The story of how a perfect family begins to unravel is an old one, and I'm afraid Oates' brought nothing new to the table in &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot; Engaging characters can only go so far if there isn't a real concrete plot to stand on.	2004-05-24

Instead it takes a rather idiosyncratic approach to the disease, exploring mostly people who have Asperger's Disorder, a &quot;less severe&quot; form of the disease. I mean less severe as in being more able to &quot;pass&quot; for normal. People with Asperger's generally have high IQs and excellent verbal skills. Well, some do and some don't.<br />If there's anything this book shows, is that the line between Asperger's and normal is fluid. The author interviews many families whose children have the disease (or are believed to have it). Although at times, he does seem to imply that people with Aspergers are just harmless eccentrics, I don't think he is actually trying to make a case that Asperger's doesn't exist. But with the kind of approach the book takes it is hard to tell.<br />What is enjoyable is the subjects themselves, some of whom seem too impaired for everyday living, and others who that isn't true of at all. It is also interesting to see how the parents cope with their Asperger's child, many of whom here seemed to have learned to take the behavior in stride. Look for clinical information elsewhere.	2004-05-24

I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.<br />But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.<br />The format makes for an odd read.

However, a few things bothered me about &quot;Evensong.&quot;<br />First, as mentioned by another reviewer, the protagonist Margaret did not really behave like a thirty-year-old woman. Her attitudes towards such things as the Internet, even allowing for a Luddite-like upbringing, seemed more characteristic of a senior citizen. Also, she seemed so steadfast, so sure of herself, that it was hard to see her as human. If her conflict with her husband - apart from that one juicy fight - had been fully developed in the book that would have helped the reader care about her.<br />Also, Chase did not really talk or act like a teenager from a rural area. He was an alcoholic, and it seemed that the author - through Margaret and Adrian - believed that if he would just learn to love himself - through watching others set a good example, his addiction would vanish. This seemed like an odd attitude to have at the turn of this century. It was implied that he wouldn't have had any serious problems if his parents had been loving. While there is truth to this, it struck me as a simplistic handling of a serious problem.<br />I enjoyed many of the secondary characters such as Gus, her daughter, and Grace, the larger-than-life evangelist. However, I felt the book's end kind of fizzled, despite all the color and depth the author had worked into the novel.	2004-05-24

I went to college a decade later but can still see a lot of myself in the protagonist and his friends. Danny, the main character,comes from a working-class background, which causes him to view Yale with a somewhat different perspective than his well-to-do dormmates. Although he enthusiastically samples this foreign world, he finds he is not able to leave his old life behind so easily. During a vacation, he becomes involved with an old high school classmate, and, largely due to his own passivity, lets the relationship continue after he goes back to school.<br />The second half of the book takes place during a school break and examines the truth to the statement &quot;you can't go home again&quot; as Danny takes over his father's lunch truck route while he is recuperating from an operation. I won't describe all the messes this young man becomes entangled with, but suffice to say how he finally resolves them is hilarious.<br />The only thing I disliked about the book was the often almost-maddening passivity of Danny. He seemed to have a knack for getting out of tough spots due to luck, not his own effort. As a result, he did not seem to grow much by the end.

The author emphasizes working through our issues as adults, not playing &quot;blame games.&quot; Interviews with people from all walks of life are liberally quoted throughout each chapter. <br />What makes this book exceptional is that the author is advocating education and change, not revenge. He shows how examining your parents' history in detail can help you heal and move forward as a fully functioning adult free to make decisions based on something else than what your parents' would say. <br />Controlling parents don't have to be outwardly abusive nor do they always have malevolent intentions towards their children. However, trauma stays with a person and its after-effects can be passed on to the next generation.<br />The author clearly contrasts unhealthy with healthy parenting and offers checklists to help the reader. He explores why people overcontrol, and he provides exercises to help the reader work through his or her feelings. Most helpfully, he reiterates that it was not the reader's fault, and it is not required that the reader change - but if he or she begins to explore that possibility, it can lead to great rewards.	2004-05-21

Rather than encourage the reader to break with her parents, she advocates learning your mother's history and examining your own attitudes and behavior.

He writes so well that they seem unnecessary; they're the equivalent often of someone jabbing you with a pencil as you're trying to study. This memoir is almost interchangeable from all the others by young writers who tell their story of grappling with broken homes, mood disorders, breakdowns, etc. However, there is almost no emphasis on the author's career, instead we get page after page of quotes of a distant relative, Hankerchief Moody, whose odd life interests the author (although there is never any guarantee from the beginning that they are actually related). While this may sound like a way to keep the book from getting bogged down in too much &quot;I&quot; time, it doesn't really work. When the author stops quoting his relative, he digresses into ruminations about various subjects such as school shootings and William Burroughs. <br />To be fair, the reader is warned in the beginning about how the writer will digress. You can't say you haven't been warned. But by the time a writer pens a memoir, hopefully he or she is old enough to have pulled many of the threads together. Cliched though it is, Moody does not seem to have &quot;come to terms&quot; or had much closure on the rocky period he describes here. That would have helped. Or maybe just a skilled editor.	2004-05-19

It is hard to separate her depression from the personality she would have had without problems with mental illness. Many depressives do not have her narcissism (thank god) and they feel that they don't deserve good things happen (which Wurtzel seemed to accept as her just due). But she does do a good job evoking the hopelessness and unpleasantness of depression. I should know; I've experienced depression firsthand.<br />What annoyed me is that Wurtzel seemed completely unable to appreciate the help she was given - it seemed like people were literally lining up around the block to help her. You don't have to be free of depression to express gratitude or at least do the courtesy of saying thank you - something the author was apparently never taught. Even if you don't feel well, there's something dangerous about letting your mood problems justify your horrendous treatment of others. Wurtzel seems to regard people as disposable, but in her case it didn't seem to matter, there was always someone she could cajole into holding her hand.<br />From her other books, apparently she still can't get her act together for more than a little while. This is unfortunate. Is she, like Lauren Slater, going to make a career out of problem memoirs?	2004-05-19

Like Columbine, it is the story of two outsiders who plot then carry through a grisly revenge on their fellow students who tormented them. Teachers, parents and other students from prom queens to geeks all are given space to recap the school shooting for the reader. The sense of alienation and confusion these people feel comes through clearly. It is an original way of exploring what might make two seemingly ordinary suburban teenagers \\"snap.\\"	2004-05-19

It is atypical among the books that claim to chronicle the triumph of the human spirit, for the changes the teacher protagonist makes in the main student's life are small, and not as easily labeled miraclulous. In some ways, it lacks the satisfying conclusion of &quot;One's Child.&quot; Venus, like many of the teacher's students is electively mute. The teacher's work with her is impeded by Venus' family's poverty, and lack of administrative support. Her attempts to find out even basic facts about Venus' background are hindered at every turn.<br />Yet, she does find ways to connect with the child, although one of the most powerful tools comes under fire for being politically incorrect. This book shows how even small steps of progress can be exciting.<br />I admire the writer's refusal to sugarcoat herself and her relationships with her students, the administration, and her classroom aide. Nothing is given an undeserving glossy finish here. And I suggest that the &quot;coldness&quot; some reviewers mention may be due to Venus, not her teacher, as she is much less verbal and emotionally expressive than say, Sheila of &quot;One Child.&quot;	2004-05-15

When she died unexpectedly, her mother brought over a diary page to Martha, the protagonist. Stunned by Olive's writing that she wished they could have been friends, and guilty over not knowing of this during her life, Martha decides to try writing a novel as her family spends a summer at the beach. Her relationships with the boys next door, her grandmother whose house they are staying at, and her family are unexpectedly described in more thoughtful detail than the average young adult book. Not since the Anastasia Krupnik books, have I read such a three-dimensional portrait of a senior citizen.<br />Martha, on the cusp of puberty, finds her relationship to the two boys next door has changed. Every exchange between them feels genuine and what ultimately happens is what would happen in real life, not a glossy teen movie. In the end, she makes little progress on her novel, but discovers much about herself, helped by both adults and peers.	2004-05-15

He's uncomfortable around teenagers, and he feels unqualified to teach minority youths from a different background than his. Those would be on my list of reasons to refuse, too. But he goes and finds the students to be surprisingly articulate, more so than the adult education students he teaches elsewhere. The inmates in turn, irritate, amaze, disgust, and impress Salzman with their writing. Some go on to healthier lives, some don't, but he manages (cliche though it is) to make an impact on quite a few - mostly when he believes he's done the opposite. Highly recommended.	2004-05-15

The body count approaches Columbine-like proportions shortly after the two protagonists enroll in a new magnet school. But, although the author tries, there is almost zero black humor in this book. And if it's a satire, it's largely unsuccessful due to a couple of unbelievable premises, cardboard villains (way too many - they become interchangeable), and just too little time spent fleshing out the two protagonists - although they do come off as likeable and sympathetic. Their families were established as zany/eccentric, and there were almost no \\"down time\\" moments in which the reader could take a breath of fresh air. It was high drama from beginning to end.<br />Frankly, I was offended that this book seems not to be marketed under \\"horror\\", but is being reviewed as if it's some kind of quality young adult novel, not the schlock it actually is. The deaths were numerous, grisly and made the lack of serious scrutiny to the school until the end impossible to buy. You'd think parents would be going to the police and the press, yanking their kids out right and left if there was even one very public and grisly death in front of them in their school. But not here. No real parent would care enough about high test scores to jeopardize their child's life - their literal life, not the figurative one. <br />Also, the author seemed to be mixing his decades with talk of \\"mixers\\" - one character was in college, only to have another demonstrate a very current knowledge of sexual harassment, calling it by its rightful name. Was this book supposed to be set in the present, past or future - or did the author just not care enough to make this clear to the reader?<br />Oh, there were lots of questions raised - the sign of a good author, but also a bad one. Why did Kate's mom suddenly snap out of her madness? Why couldn't the author come up with a better way to force Kate to attend the magnet school? No one is going to buy that she (apparently an American citizen) is denied a free public education in the United States now or any time in the near future. What is going to happen to the second demon after it wreaks havoc on the last villain?<br />Again, it would really have helped to make it clear where and when this book was set.<br />And did they really - literally - have to go skipping off into the sunset on the last page?	2004-05-15

The best authors have the ability to gracefully handle today's \\"hot button\\" issues via writing without beating the reader over the head. Sadly, this was not one of them.<br />However, most of the characters were three-dimensional (except for the Christians).

Not necessarily. Most of its stories are shorter than the average New Yorker fiction piece, and there's no need to read them all to enjoy the book. Short story collections don't have to be read straight through like a chapter book.<br />Another complaint: It shouldn't have examples of how kids humiliate other kids lest it give them ideas on how to be mean? Well, guess what? Kids don't need a book to teach them meanness. They pick it up from peers and TV quite nicely, and also from their families and society at large. Just look at the current news, whether international, national or local.<br />This book is a good start for a discussion about school violence, such as Columbine. The authors get inside the heads of their teenage protagonists nicely and for the most part, the dialogue and actions come across as authentic, not forced. A brief bio follows each story, explaining why the author chose the subject he or she did.<br />Standouts in my opinion were \\"Standing on the Roof Naked\\" by Francess Lantz, \\"A Letter from the Fringe\\" by Joan Bauer, and \\"Through a Window\\" by Angela Johnson. The last is unique to the book because it focuses on a character who might be classified as a bystander, not a victim or bully.	2004-05-13

Although the author warns the reader amply against reading this book, I don't happen to agree. But do read at least a few Snicket books first, so you'll have some idea of what's going on (this is the latest in a long series). <br />Briefly, it continues the adventures of the hapless Baudelaire orphans, Sunny, Klaus and Violet. The last two are separated from their baby sister Sunny, who is forced to cook and clean for Count Olaf's troop on a snowy mountain. Meanwhile Violet and Klaus meet a surprising companion who helps them further decode the mystery of VFD.

A recent high school grad chooses to postpone college for a year - much to the dismay of his father - and instead takes a job in a lab which deals with cloning and genetics. Like the stereotypical male, the protagonist believes that if he can successfully compartmentalize each aspect of his life, things will be fine. Unfortunately, as his girlfriend uncovers what he has tried to keep secret - his mother's Huntington's disease - and he begins to suspect a past connection with his parents and his boss, that his father refuses to discuss, his life becomes steadily more messy. To compound matters, he begins to suspect that something is not quite kosher at the lab and with his brilliant but quixotic boss. Although the end climax and confrontation seemed tame, the events leading up to it held my interest.<br />The book reminded me of two mysteries by Charles Atkins, in its raising of philosophical/existential/psychological issues, its vividly drawn characters (presented as human not caricatures of scientists), and its easily recognizable Boston setting. Highly recommended.	2004-05-08

There, in a Dickensian-like conditions under (Roald)Dahlian like keepers, Stanley digs holes daily with the other hapless boys. Soon he comes to realize that he may be digging for reasons that have nothing to do with building character, and everything connected with the curse placed on his family long ago. <br />With his new friend Zero, Stanley manages to unravel the mystery and revoke the curse. Like Dahl and Dickens, all ends happily with the villains suitably punished. Along the way, the characters learn about the importance of persistence, loyalty to your friends, and how to get rid of foot odor for good.<br />And the movie is just as terrific.	2004-05-08

The author resists this urge and hurls the reader into the dysfunctional (but not cliched) world of Dolores Price. Many writers spend their time creating idealized versions of themselves - book shelves are crammed with protagonists who are smarter, prettier and more sensitive than anyone around them. How refreshing to meet a character who is human, with all the shortcomings of anyone walking down the street. \\"She's Come Undone\\" charts the life of a young woman who survives abuse and eventually finds peace and self-respect. This is a well-worn theme, but the journey she takes is uniquely hers. <br />It is hard to describe the book without using the cliches of the self-help movement, but it easily soars above the typical Oprah recommendation. Maybe Renee Zellweger can plump up again to play the protagonist because I sure would love to see this book on the big screen.	2004-05-08

His wife has recently left him, and his schizophrenic twin brother has been incarcerated due to an &quot;act of violence against himself.&quot; In his attempts to help his brother, Dominick stumbles into psychotherapy with a woman who is also seeing his twin. (Think &quot;Prince of Tides.&quot;) He soon starts to uncover a number of traumatic memories that easily rival anything in the aforementioned book. <br />Embedded in Dominick's story is the story of his grandfather - a manuscript which takes up a good chunk of the book. Incest, physical and emotional abuse, illegitimacy, rape - you name it, Lifetime would probably option this for a movie, if the protagonist happened to be female. But it's more than just a melodramatic tale of a survivor learning how to heal and move on. The protagonist isn't always likeable, but there are plenty of other characters who are. It's not &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; but that's not a bad thing.	2004-05-08

The ordinary college travails an American woman goes through pale beside the ordeals these characters must endure. The discussions of the books - classics by Nabokov, Austen and others - made me decide to read some of the ones I had missed during my own college period, certainly a sign the book made a deep impression. And the ordinary details of everyday living were rendered so sharply, I could almost taste the ice cream with cold coffee poured over it and see the various pompous men who had the power to make these women's lives miserable simply by being born into the right sex. Considering a woman can be punished by simply showing a few tendrils of hair, you can imagine what happens when they dare to do slightly more subversive things, such as break up with a boyfriend, take a radical position as a university teacher - or write a book like this one. Luckily, it made it to publication, in a way a small miracle.	2004-05-08

A couple of the stories were impressive - the first in particular. But they ended in a confusing place, with not much resolved that I could see. The minor characters weren't developed enough to make it clear why they did what they did, and had sudden changes of heart. Like in the first, it was never clear why Daphne decided to be nice to the narrator - sure, she was not the kind of girl to join in bullying, but why did she choose then to start supporting the narrator? It just was not clear. Also, there was not enough information about the narrator - why she got picked on apart from being quiet? Considering all the accolades showered on the author, though, I'm willing to entertain the possibility that I missed something in the book.<br />I picked up the book because I was hoping to learn more about a culture that I have never experienced firsthand.

Personally, I much prefer the author's less bulky books such as &quot;Barn Blind&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot; not because I don't enjoy reading complexly plotted novels, but because I feel that if you have the knack of creating memorable characters, they deserve more &quot;screen time&quot; so to speak.	2004-05-06

She obviously does not suffer from the syndrome that makes writers veer from embarrassing self-deprecation to pompous claims of being a genius. There is nothing I dislike more than a novelist using a how-to guide for the purpose of complaining how he or she should be more well-known and/or critically acclaimed. George avoids the temptation of taking pot shots at her critics and instead focuses on the writing process itself. She is admirably honest about stating that what works for her won't necessarily work for everyone. Therefore, even if you can't see yourself having the same kind of self-discipline she does, you will probably still find at least part of the book useful.<br />Where George differs from many other writers is that she writes about a place (England) where she was not raised and does not live. However, the process she uses to ensure her mysteries are realistic is interesting in and of itself. <br />People who believe the writing process is some mysterious and murky voodoo only a few are lucky enough to know will be pleasantly surprised at how clearly George describes the writing process, even if the path that they discover works best for them is not identical.	2004-05-06

Men are mature; guys are - well, the very opposite. A few parts of this book are weak and could have used some sharpening up, but mostly the \\"Guide' is hilarious. Particularly amusing is the quiz to determine whether or not you are a guy, as well as the dead-on sections on sports - \\"Hitler was a bad person, but he did not miss important free throws in the middle of the playoffs.\\" <br />Also amusing is the dialogue between Elaine and Roger. With just a few lines, Barry shows the vast gulf between men and women communication-wise and makes the reader pessimistic about ever being able to cross it. Men, Barry explains, have not evolved much since their cavemen days, and when it comes to commnicating with their mate, bumble around much like a dog trying to remember if its human gave it permission to pee inside. While much of this is obviously exaggerated, much rings eerily true. <BR>Forget the relationship gurus with their own talk-shows, and read this book instead.	2004-05-06

The topic has probably been of interest to everyone at one point or another in their lives; who has not wondered at least once if they would be leading a different kind of life if they were the oldest, youngest, or only child? <br />While I appreciated the liveliness of the many examples used to illustrate the author's points, the luridness of some made it hard to take the evidence as anything but purely anecdotal. At times, it seemed like the author was rather too-eager explain how he arrived at his conclusions. There is nothing wrong with that necessarily, but I think most readers of psych books written for a general audience are willing to take more on faith than the author expected.<br />The most original point for me was the author's declaration that birth order didn't always mean that a child would go on to be a leader, a follower, a failure or whatever. Birth order does not necessarily predict a child's personality either. Instead, divorce, death, remarriage, economic background, helps determine how many resources a parent has to divide amongst his/her children. In fact, economic difference is often wider between adult siblings than it is between children from different families. <br />This book will probably hold your attention, but some readers may be left wanting more hard evidence and less anecdotes.	2004-04-12

Even the topic of sexual abuse is given more shading than one might expect. No fingers are pointed or lines drawn between good and evil. The reader is left to draw conclusions for him or herself.<br />Only one thing tended to jar the rhythm and tone; in parts the language was almost too elegant.

As I read it, I felt like I was being born along on a raft on a sleepy, sunny summer day. It reads like a stream of consciousness, and I found it easiest to just dip in and out of it. There did not seem to be any linear organization, but the poetry of Mayes' prose compensated for that nicely. Don't expect the book to &quot;pick up&quot; at any point, it maintains the same leisurely pace until the end. Do however, expect your mouth to start watering, as Mayes describes her meals (many recipes are provided, as well). No matter how much of a carnivore you are, you will probably find yourself craving pasta with fresh tomato, basil and olives. <br />The nice thing about this book is just as you find yourself envying Mayes for her luck in finding this house, you get a description of the temperamental plumbing or disappearing workmen, and you think twice about going out and plunking down your life savings into a house in Italy.

The author juggles such disparate topics as child abuse, antique plates, social psychology, line dancing, and the Atkins diet to produce a fascinating read.<br />Also, it's nice not to have the tiresome &quot;amateur woman detective falls in love with handsome cop storyline&quot; for once.<BR>Thank you, AP.	2004-04-11

I hate when I sense the writer is trying to protect his or her characters from the natural consequences of their actions. This certainly was not the case here! Yet, flawed characters can be likeable - but none of &quot;House's&quot; were. I sympathized with the Colonel, as bullheaded as he was, until he started beating his wife. As for Kathy, I simply could not believe it took as long as it did for her to start feeling the pinch of not paying any bills. That strained credibility.<br />I am not a fan of multiple viewpoints (popular as they are), yet I could have stayed with the book if it had just been Kathy and the Colonel alternating. But Lester's backstory was introduced too late in the book for me to care what was driving him anymore. At first he seemed just a sweet lunkhead-type guy willing to help the proverbial damsel in distress, then he turned into a stalker straight out of a Lifetime Channel movie. At that point, I only cared about the Colonel's wife and son, but it wasn't enough for me to finish the book. And let me just add that I finish at least 99 percent of the books I read.	2004-04-11

How? It seemed to me that things would have been worse had he tried to interfere in his older brother's initation/hazing. I would have done the same thing. Not that I condone hazing. Still, after reading Pat Conroy's novels, I expected a lot worse. I have no idea what the author omitted, but most of the stuff seemed tame in comparison. (Not that I have ever been hazed.)<br />I agree with the reviewer who stated that the narrator reveals too little about himself. I kept hoping to read about him making a connection that did not center around the frat - when the girl smiled at him in class, I cheered, thinking that maybe there would be one bright spot in an otherwise bleak book. <br />Not to psychologize too much, but it occurred to me that perhaps the author undertook the hazing to prove to himself (if subconsciously) that he could take that kind of trauma without falling apart - as he had during the kidnapping.<br />Finally, as someone who was depressed throughout most of college, I can only hope the author finally received the therapy he needed to recover from his trauma.	2004-04-10
US	50067221	R27YY6MZAIYVLE	0689836023	835820403	Silent to the Bone	Books	3	3	4	N	Y	disappointing	First of all, I should state that it was not any of the sexual innuendo that bothered me. Judy Blume was writing about \\"Viagra moments\\" decades before this writer. Do we still have to be such Puritans nowadays? Given the extent the writer went to avoid objectionable language (even though any TV watching kid hears the \\"b-word\\" word frequently) I don't think a single mention is going to damage young readers for life. Would you rather have your 10-year-old read an eloquent, well-written and thoughtful book by a Newbury-award winning writer or watch a sitcom loaded with sexual innuendo whose primary purpose is to score cheap laughs? The choice is yours. <br />Anyway, what bugged me was that even though the friendship between these two boys was convincing, they still didn't come across quite as real-life kids. ELK's characters are not just smart, they're smarter than everybody else, including the adults around them. If you make your characters smarter than everyone, the reader will probably have less patience and sympathy when they fail to solve their problems. My feeling is, if they have that much brainpower, they are probably going to solve their problems eventually, and thus the tale loses a lot of its suspense.<br />Finally, although this might come from too much \\"Law and Order\\" I was disappointed that (SPOILER) the family chose not to bring the nanny to trial. After all, their daughter almost wound up dead or brain damaged! How selfish of Branwell to forgo justice simply because he was embarrassed about his sexual attraction. I felt sorry for him, but given what his sister went through, I couldn't like him.	2004-04-10

The book will make you think twice about the kid nodding off in the corner of the classroom and wonder what aptitudes he/she has that are dormant.<br />Did I mention that the protagonist also unlocks powerful religious and mystical secrets? That she winds up chanting (untutored) Hebrew in a manner not even learned rabbis can achieve? Well, that's the flawed part. <br />The author also gives equal time to the protagonist's father's, mother's and brother's storylines, which is also part of the problem. They are compelling characters, if not always likeable. The inter-family dynamics are uncannily portrayed, and the reader does want to know what happens to these people - but the author is juggling too many balls at a time. To mix metaphors, she boldly strikes out for the deep end that even experienced writers avoid and flounders. That is, of course, just one reader's opinion.	2004-04-04

That's probably why I'm not as dismissive of polictical-correctness and believe that it has some positive benefits to today's education. I don't believe examining the classics through the eyes of today's students - as opposed to Columbia in the 1950's when the student body consisted of mainly Caucasian boys - is all that detrimental to the &quot;great works&quot; themselves. Perhaps the author would have been less likely to forget the books from his youth had they been discussed from a less-reverent viewpoint. <br />I don't think reading should be a kind of therapy first and foremost. But I do think women, and other minorities do have the right to study their culture (however, &quot;marginalized&quot; or unimportant) it is considered in relation to &quot;Western&quot; one. At times, Denby seemed to imply political correctness was only some trendy fad and did not have any roots in real discontent. That was a mistake.<br />Anyway, I do admire anyone who goes back and actually grapples with such authors as Hegel, Dante and Conrad, and has the humility to expose his struggles in a book. If I had a quarter for everyone who has said to me, &quot;Someday, I'm gonna read the classics again...&quot; but never actually did, I'd be rich.<br />On a personal level, I did go back and read some of the books I'd missed in college, but not as many as I'd planned while reading &quot;Great Books.&quot; Still, I would recommend that readers sample some of those classics themselves.	2004-04-04
US	50067221	R3CWMMOQ2X0UU2	0385512104	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: A Novel (Alex Awards (Awards))	Books	3	1	3	N	Y	minority view	This book, as others have noted, is a pitch-perfect narration from a high-functioning autistic teenager who has written it in order to help him solve the mystery of who murdered his neighbor's dog. It starts out charming and unintentionally (from Christopher, the narrator's, viewpoint) amusing. But I didn't think it sustained this tone. <br />A minor point, but one that put me off was the narrator's focus on bodily functions. There are too many non-autistic characters out there whose creators feel compelled to describe their bodily functions in grotesquely loving detail, as if readers aren't familiar with what happens in the bathroom. This just seemed a continuation of that trend, however plausible this fixation was for an austistic man. A silly thing to comment on here? Maybe.<br />The book's focus shifts from who killed the dog to what is happening to the narrator's parents. This is the problem right there. Autistics (at least here) aren't equipped to understand the complexities of human relationships that most of us take for granted. So even though Christopher's limitations to puzzling out his parents' problems rang true, they also limited the novel as a whole - because aren't the best novel characters suppose to achieve some sort of change or growth in their perceptions at the end? Or at least the realization that they can't change the way they want?	2004-04-04

Although not formally diagnosed when in school, I believe that I, like the author, am both gifted and learning disabled. (The gap between my verbal and math SATs would convince anyone of this.) The descriptions of what it is like as a young student who most people consider smart to \\"fake it\\" in one's problem areas are the most painfully accurate I have ever read. The narrator's disabilities extend far beyond what most of us think of as having \\"problems with math.\\" Making change, following directions on a map, and telling time are all part of the narrator's disability. In this book, she shows how the inadequate research done on this disability, coupled with her impressive masking skills, and prejudice on her teachers' part as to what a \\"dumb\\" kid looks and behaves like, all made her school years more difficult than they should be for anyone. Luckily, parents who insisted on speaking up to the school system, as well as Sam's own gifts helped her graduate and complete college.<br />Another thing that intrigued and angered me was a comment one admissions' officer made to Sam's (the narrator's) mother as they were researching colleges: \\"Our students are perfect in every way.\\" i.e. we couldn't possibly consider your daughter. Really? I worry about a college that weeds out applicants in that manner, especially given that the narrator had already published a book.<br />If you have ever seen a movie or TV program on adults who cannot read but who have managed to negotiate and even excel in daily life, you will have some idea of what life was like for the narrator during her youth. What makes the book so compelling is that it's not just written by someone who wants to talk about a disability, but also by a poet and gifted writer who can convey what it is like to have her particular disability perfectly.	2004-04-04

As other reviewers have mentioned, the omission of just about every wacky secondary character in \\"Pink Slip\\" greatly weakened the book. Lisa's family, mainly. Since Ebb was working at the same place as he was when we met him, I couldn't help but hope that we'd bump into Peggy or Hook again, just anyone to break up the relentless focus on Ebb-Lisa/Lisa-Ebb. However, stereotypical they were, those former characters added, not detracted, from \\"Pink Slip.\\" Now with the two protagonists having marital trouble and difficulty communicating, other less serious characters would have been a real treat.<br />I was also disappointed that Lisa's potential agent made an intriguing appearance than disappeared for pages and pages, while I slogged on through many references and jokes about bodily functions/sex. Like in the movies, it always seems that the heroine ultimately has to choose between a career and taking care of a family full-time. While Lisa still seemed determined to write, her potential career as a novelist seemed to just fizzle out in the last few pages. I was hoping against hope that she'd actually publish her book, but alas, the author left that up in the air. How nice it would be to see a book/movie/tv show where the female protagonist stayed true to her dreams that didn't necessarily involve romance. Oh well.	2004-03-15

According to him, his main strengths are persistence and perhaps a bit of blind loyalty to a coach who even the most non-judgmental reader will realize is a walking personality disorder. Perhaps Conroy's strength as a player in college is the same as his strength as a writer - i.e. a willingness to show up, take notes, invest much time doing so, and finally, bear witness for his team and school.<br />Those who have read Conroy's &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; will have a sense of deja vu in many places, and it may be fascinating to see how Conroy first shaped his time at the Citadel into fiction. You get to meet the real people whom the characters in &quot;Lords&quot; were based on, and also get a good sense of why Conroy kept his protagonist's father deceased.<br /><br />He, himself, may disagree with this, but I believe that the early abuse Conroy received at the hands of his military father, may have kept him from seeing his college coach as the monster he was. The book is well-written but charts a lot more humiliation than triumph, and the reader may become unsure as to whether Conroy is exaggerating or under-stating. One page, X is a monster, the next, he is singing X's praises. So the read as a whole, keeps your interest, but in many places can be somewhat grueling to get through. As a writer, he is both acutely self-aware and maddingly blind to other people's character.<br />Towards the end, Conroy states that his father eventually changed, and became closer to the idealized father his &quot;The Great Santini&quot; book/movie. Yet he leaves out the details of this transformation. That was a disappointment. But maybe that's the subject of a future book.	2004-03-15

He did what very few books on mood disorders do, which was interview a broad spectrum of people and let their stories be heard. We hear from spoiled yuppies who can afford every trend under the sun, but we also hear from people for whom you can't help but think - \\"no wonder they're so depressed, they have no money, their meds don't work, and they can only get partial help.\\" Solomon also examines how race, sexual orientation, and gender can shape one's depression. I have read widely on mood disorders, and his was the first I have seen that addressed the relationship between homosexuality and depression for more than a token paragraph.<br />I think sometimes the author's reach exceeded his grasp, and the book could have been trimmed without losing its impact. It's a good book to dip into rather than plow straight through, if you're depressed that is.	2004-03-15

As loners do not often open up to many around them, I appreciated meeting another loner who thought and felt similarly to me, even if it was through a book and not face to face. While other forms of discrimination and prejudice in American society are now regarded as abhorrent, it is still acceptable to harbor a healthy prejudice against introverts. Introverts are a minority, but one that is not considered to have special needs that are just as legitimate as the majority - extroverts. I do not mean to imply that introverts are fragile souls, just that they do seem to be constructed differently from the start than their more sociable counterparts.<br />While there is often a bit too much of an &quot;us vs. them&quot; tone to the book, the author makes many important and often ignored points. I especially appreciated the discussion of why criminals are so often pegged as loners, and how incorrect that assumption often is. <br />The book, on the whole, read like a collection of previously published essays, but it was so evocative and elegantly written, that I forgave it its somewhat disjointed feel. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I am grateful to the author for publishing this book.	2004-03-15

I was reminded of the Columbine shootists, who performed their unforgettable carnage shortly before they were to graduate, too. You might wonder why they couldn't hang on a little longer, but I think the book does a superb job of showing how each act of bullying piles up until you start seeing things in either/or terms. <br />Some of the bullying seemed so extreme and unbelievable, but I'm willing to chalk that up to the fact that I've never been a teenage boy. I also had some trouble with how indifferent the protagonist's parents seemed - even when the evidence that there was something seriously wrong going on in their son's life was staring them right in the face. What happened to the protagonist seemed to go far, far beyond even what the most indifferent would chalk up to &quot;boys being boys.&quot;<br />Kudos to the author for resisting the urge to make his protagonist and his friends wealthy and famous while all the baddies got their comeuppance. <br />The next time something like Columbine happens, those who are looking for at least a few answers to the question of &quot;why?&quot; should read this book. Better yet, they should go talk to their kids.	2004-03-14

I note this because some of the reviews on Amazon erroneously say the characters are in seventh grade. Anyway, these four sixth graders go onto defeat the seventh, then eighth graders in their schools, and eventually take the regional trivia bowl championship.<br />The four children \\"can spell and define puberty but have not yet gone through it.\\" Given this, I can accept the tea parties and some of the other pastimes they engage in in \\"The View.\\" Also, they are NOT presented as perfect without any character flaws or problems. The \\"Souls' as they call themselves are exceptionally intelligent and compassionate, but they - at least for Ethan and Nadia - do not make the \\"right\\" decisions instantly. Nadia, for example, wavers between helping some stranded baby turtles, or holding on to her grudge against her grandfather and father.<br />This book also has some wonderful imagery. For example, ELK compares painting Nadia without her freckles to brushing the cinnamon off cinnamon toast.<br />In summary, I would highly recommend this book.	2004-03-14

This book is a collection of some of her earlier columns.<br />I remember picking it up in a bookstore, and reading the part about \\"Rain Man\\" and laughing so much I was helplessly bent over and terrified that I would be thrown out or carted away by men in white coats. Luckily, I wasn't. <br />Hollywood badly needs someone to prick its enormous bubble of egotism, and Libby is always up to the job. Many movie stars are in desperate need of a reality check, a reminder that their hangnails aren't on the same level as say, world peace. <br />In addition to Libby, we meet her adorable children, Mitchell-Shawn and Jennifer, her friend the terminally single Stacy Schiff, her husband Josh (like Bill Clinton he can balance a budget, then jog over to pick up a bag of donuts), her mother, and her shrink - all of whom contribute columns.<br />Equally funny if not funnier than Dave Barry at his best, this book is a worthy addition to anyone with a slightly warped sense of humor's shelf.	2004-03-14

Rather there is a gentle and compassionate approach to helping writers - and creators of all stripes - with being &quot;blocked.&quot; Although Cameron has written at length about this subject elsewhere, I was impressed with her ability to find new ways of exploring this problem that probably not a single writer hasn't encountered.<br />As someone with a strong self-critical and perfectionistic streak, I appreciated Cameron's approach to addressing writer's block and other obstacles that can appear in the path of a creator and stop him/her dead. I highly recommend this book, especially for those tangled in depression, doubt and negativity around the subject of their art.	2004-03-14

Of course, we should! but a sermon is better suited to church than a novel. \\"The Outcasts\\" had an intriguing premise - a young girl masterminds a successful plan to save her uncles' towers from being destroyed due to them serving no \\"useful purpose.\\" However, once the reader gets to know the heroine, Margaret, they are abruptly plunged back into the camp world for the last third of the book, with Margaret making no appearance. ELK has firmly established the noxiousness of Margaret's former cabin mates, as well as the camp director. I, for one, had no desire to spend any further time listening to their cattiness and witnessing their unlikely change of heart toward Margaret. I had thought they were there only in the beginning and with the sole purpose of establishing Margaret's \\"incorrigible\\" personality. After she leaves camp and finds allies, why bother letting the reader know what happens to the cabinmates? They were so one-dimensional, I really didn't care.<br />But the writing itself is beautiful. I just wish the author had spent a little more time on the two uncles. Surely, men who created such beautiful towers, would be more fascinating subjects than a bunch of catty school-girls.<br />True, \\"The Outcasts\\" is superior to a lot of the fiction currently being published, but sadly, that isn't saying much.	2004-03-13

As a writer with a mood disorder, I deeply appreciate the efforts of writers/psychiatrists, such as Lauren Slater and Kay Redfield Jamison, to delve into the creator's psyche without overly pathologizing it. While some find Slater's poetic style too distracting, I enjoy it, which may be why I had such difficulty with this book.<br />First off, it reads like a psych textbook, and as I assume it's being marketed to a more general audience, this is not a plus. In fact, I found it even harder to follow and duller than my old psych books from college. I was hoping to learn more about various disorders that seem to predominantly affect writers, but not at the expense of skimming over their quirks and lifestyles. What do I mean by that? Well, I'd have my interest piqued by a description of a writer, only to be unceremoniously plunged back into four-syllable word paragraphs.<br />Here's a random sentence: &quot;Also unlike Broca's aphasics, patients with Wernicke's aphasia have much more trouble with semantics than syntax, suggesting that syntax is primarily a frontal lobe function and semantics a temporal lobe function.&quot; (pg. 157) While it's understandable, it's hardly the sort of thing you want to curl up by the fire by. It's also hardly the sort of thing someone with depression would want to plow through in order to gain insight into their condition.<br />My suggestion: Read Jamison's works on manic depression if you are a writer who would like to know why you have some of the unusual habits you do.<br />My other complaint is how lightly Flaherty seemed to present her hospitalization. Nine out of ten patients are probably too ill to care where the room with the Capn Crunch is, so I assume her visit was atypical. You don't get a strong sense that she identifies with the mentally ill people she sees regardless of in what capacity. (Although I believe she is sincere those times she does express sympathy, it just doesn't pervade the whole book.)	2004-02-22

I don't think many women who work away from home but must take care of their house and families in addition to their job, would appreciate the not-so-veiled contempt for people who don't have the time or money to stay home, eat bonbons, commune with nature, and raise all their veggies from scratch. Just because someone chooses to grab a cup of joe from Dunkin' Donuts instead of making their own shade grown coffee does NOT mean they are evil, ignorant or lack compassion, self-awareness and respect for the planet. This kind of mindset is dangerous, juvenile and only serves to alienate people who might otherwise be open to your views on how to make the world a better place.<br />Read Anne Lamott or Nancy Mairs on much the same themes that Kingsolver does here and you'll come away feeling like the author is a real and flawed person like 99 percent of the population, not someone who does not practice the compassion she preaches. The only passion this writer has is for judging others - and finding them lacking.	2004-01-19

It's a fascinating angle - reverse racism, but it was not taken to the dimensions it deserved. Bullying produces passivity, silent rage, shame, etc. in its victims, which is a rich vein to write about regardless of the skin color of those involved. But here, it just wasn't developed enough to make me feel more than just pity for Dylan (the narrator and author's stand-in).<br />I agree with those reviewers who said that one problem is that we aren't privy to how the characters actually feel, except in the most general terms. Arthur, for instance, what made him decide to stop being a &quot;good little kid&quot; and become a delinquent? Because &quot;everyone&quot; was doing it, as was suggested. Again, not enough information. Nor were the characters developed sufficiently over the 500 plus pages that the reader could eventually piece together their real motives.<br />&quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; was a great book, the experimental prose styles mostly worked there and were perfect for the way the jittery narrator, who had Tourette's Syndrome, experienced the world. Here, the author can't seem to settle on one. He even switches from third to first person for the last half, always a jolt even from the most skilled writer.<br />There are so many coming of age books; it seems like every writer has to get theirs out of his/her system. The thing that irked me was that Lethem had the material to make his story not just another &quot;Portrait of a Sensitive Writer.&quot; Oh well.	2003-11-04

While the author succeeds in raising thought-provoking questions on the subject of just what makes a person \\"snap,\\" there are still problems with this book.<br />First is the mother's attitude towards her son. Kevin appears to suffer from what psychiatrists call anhedonia, an inability to find pleasure in anything. That's it - books, movies, music, etc. with VERY few exceptions. Although the narrator decries this, she also comes to see this deficiency as a kind of superior quality, maybe because it dovetails so nicely with her own cynical outlook on the world. Eva's heritage is Armenian, and the reader is never allowed to forget this for one second. Although the book is set in New York, the narrator does not  consider herself even part American, and spends much of the book freely unleashing her anti-American opinions. Americans are too fat, too materialistic, too boorish, etc. And since her son takes no pleasure in \\"typical\\" American activities, she decides that he has already mastered the secret of life - i.e. that everything is fundamentally not worth getting excited over.<br />So we have what most people would recognize as a young psychopath and his mother, who does try her best and bears the brunt of this boy's baiting, but who is too blinded by her own prejudices to get him professional help. Although she tells us that she was once a \\"weirdo\\" in high school, with the exception of one little girl, her sympathy and compassion for Kevin's victims is nil. Her telling one mom that her child should \\"suck it up\\" is chilling.<br />Some would say it's too easy to make your villain/protagonist someone innately incapable of feeling remorse. It's also too easy to deprive your protagonist of any real likes/dislikes. We miss the chance to judge Kevin by these things, as he so cruelly judges everyone around him.<br />What surprises me is that no teachers or professionals ever suggest in this book that Kevin needs therapy. The family is well-to-do, surely they would meet someone like that in the circles they travel in.<br />It's well written, but ultimately the book left me cold.	2003-08-10

Not because I experienced the horrors the protagonist did in her youth, but because I was saddened to see that the author (presumably well out of high school) still had not managed to transcend the horrors that (presumably) happened to her in high school. <BR> <BR> If you enjoy movies where the 90-pound weakling triumphs over all the meanies, plus gets to face them down and make a big inspirational speech, you should like this book. If instead, you understand that \\"real life\\" is a lot more complex than it's painted here, that some former bullies do eventually grow up to live happy, law-abiding lives, and that not every nerd gets to play out a four star revenge fantasy on his/her tormentors, you probably won't.<br />  The characters - except for the two detectives who are pretty minor to the story - are all garishly drawn cartoons. Old antagonists just don't gain some weight and marry losers - they become obese and marry psychopaths who bash in their heads at the least provocation. The protagonist herself doesn't just get to be a published author - she gets to hobnob with celebrities plus is married to a famous singer. Wow! Aren't those meanies sorry they picked on her now! <br />  The plot is likely to leave you scratching your head. A potentially powerful storyline - the prog's mom, with whom she has a antagonistic relationship, has Alzheimer's and is dying - is ignored. Mom is merely a device to help get the heroine back to town. The book closes with a scene from the heroine's son, Mark, about to get lucky. Mark is a minor character, too, and even people who like this book probably won't care overmuch what happens to him.<br /> The book would have been stronger had it selected one or two bullies and focused on them v. Liz. Instead, every few pages, we're introduced to someone new. More cartoons pile up, until keeping track of who's who is near impossible. Liz, herself, could have been a lot more fleshed out. I wanted to sympathize with her, but she just didn't get enough page space for this to happen.<br /> In the end, I kept reading simply for the shock value the book unabashedly delivered. All through, I could hear the author putting out her tongue and singing Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.	2003-07-08

Snape was the only one who gave it right back to him consistently. And although his teachers - and sheesh Hogwarts had more than its fair share of horrible ones - were far from likeable either, I found myself occasionally siding with them (though not Professor Umbridge).<br />But while he was over the top, it seemed like Hermione has managed to morph into a serene, wise-beyond-her-years teenager - which is just plain unrealistic. Hermione and Ginny are young teens, regardless if girls are more mature than boys, they just seemed a bit too able to rise to every challenge with aplomb to be believed.<br />Adverbs. OK, this didn't prevent me from enjoying the book. But there must be five on each page. That adds up. Nobody just speaks, they have to speak calmly, brutally, sadly, shortly, etc. This occurred so regularly, that it was easy not to be distracted by them.<br />It also seemed like Rowling was determined that every character from a previous volume make a cameo appearance - from Dobby to Lockhart. While I appreciated this, at times I wished I could just learn more about the main characters like Neville. He'd disappear for pages and then Bam! there he was doing great at his defense lessons or visiting his parents at St. Mungo. Given that he's suffered similarly to Harry, it would be nice to see them contrasted more. (While Harry explodes, Neville implodes.)<br />But OOPS is still a remarkable book. It has the endlessly zany parade of characters - like Oz, the symbols that resonate with universal meeting - like Narnia, and the sly snide humor of Roald Dahl's books. And qualities that are uniquely its own. In short, it works.	2003-06-27

After all I've always been a horse lover, so none of the terminology or passion of the characters for their charges was offputting.<br />I'm a little awed at all the research the author put into this book, and respect the fact that she never romanticized the often brutal world of horse racing.<br />But - for some reason, things got a little dull toward the middle. It seemed like there was a never ending series of disappointments and detours leading up to Seabiscuit's great match race, and though the author couldn't have presented this otherwise, the constant rollercoaster ride got frustrating. <br />Maybe I did care enough about the characters, that I couldn't help getting frustrated at each injury and delay that plagued the horse and his caretakers.<br />Or maybe there are just too many truly classic horse books (for any age) for this one to stand out among its ilk. <br />I give this book four stars for being well-written (even if it did not always hold my interest) and because it does stand out against a lot of the dreck that gets published currently.  <br />At any rate, I can't wait to see the movie!	2003-04-20

For every pitch-perfect passage that captures how teenagers feel as they prepare to leave high school, there is one that falls painfully short. (Are kids still using the word \\"wicked\\" 20 years after it was first popular? Talk about longevity!) <br />Second, the heroine, Kate, is passive-aggressive, and avoids conflict to the point where it is unbelievable. I was pretty wimpy in high school, but you can bet I'd scream bloody murder and take serious action if someone stole my dead mom's watch AND my boyfriend's necklace then blatantly wore them under my nose. Particularly, if that person was living under my roof.<br />Also, Kate's viewpoint seemed too one sided when it came to her father. In the two or three scenes he addresses her directly, he seems fairly reasonable (after all, his kid won't tell him ANYTHING about her college plans). But they never wind up hashing out the issue - especially, that she told him such a huge lie. Their problems don't have to end with a Hallmark moment, but shouldn't there be some resolution?<br />Also, Terri Litch. Wouldn't her son insist on calling her \\"Mommy.\\" In the book he does so only once, which again avoids some major issues. Two's pretty young to be a reliable secret keeper. Wouldn't Kate have clued in to Mikey's parentage a LOT sooner?<br />Maybe the \\"message\\" of the Terri plotline is that a lot of kids go without the help and direction they need, even when the law punishes their abuser. In any case, nasty as she was, she was a lot more fascinating than Kate, and definitely should have been the heroine instead.	2003-03-10

This book has been heralded by numerous critics as &quot;poigant,&quot; &quot;stunning,&quot; &quot;breathtaking,&quot; etc. So who am I to criticize?<br />On a second reading of &quot;Caucasia,&quot; I found that things that slightly bugged me now downright annoyed me. All the characters are racist to varying degrees. The WASPS, those of mixed race, the African Americans, etc. They also seem filled with varying degrees of self-hatred for being white, black, or not black/white enough. The protagonist's mother is white and expends much energy on trying to get her children to hate their WASP relatives. The protagonist's dad does likewise when it comes to blacks who don't act &quot;black&quot; enough. Small wonder, Birdie and her sister Cole are ever-so-slightly confused. The true wonder is, that they don't become even more troubled.<br />Reading this book, I found myself longing for more likeable characters. After Cole was &quot;abducted&quot; by her dad, there was this void that was never satisfactorily filled. A character can have prejudices and still be someone the reader is drawn to and cares about. But except for Birdie and Cole, there was no one. &quot;Caucasia&quot; is a wasteland when it comes to engaging you with its characters. And it leaves a very sour taste in your mouth.	2003-03-10

It is worth spending an hour with, but look elsewhere for what the book is being marketed as.<br />Last, I was disappointed that not the slightest effort is made to pull all the vignettes together into some sort of intelligent conclusion.

The teens in this book speak like they do in Hollywood movies, all self-consciously \\"hip\\" and snide. It seems like the author tries to shanghai an example of \\"teenspeak\\" such as \\"wild and happy parade of the teeth going\\" or \\"rule the cule\\" onto every page, and this makes it an awkward read. Most of the time, today's teens speak like everyone else, at least the ones I know, though of course they have their own catch-phrases. <BR> The characters also seem strangely young at times. I doubt kids who are partying hard every week night insult people by remarking on their imaginary \\"boogers.\\" That insult belongs in elementary school, at least when I was young. Adolescent girls are a little more sophisticated in their barbs by high school.<BR> This was an original take on bullying, though, with several characters who were strikingly well-developed and did not fit into any \\"box\\" to quote one. I wish, however, the author hadn't tried to tie everything up in the final chapter. It reminded me of those movies where we get explanations of what happened to every character at the end, even the minor ones we could care less about (Like \\"Loser\\") I think a little come-uppance is great, but when cosmic justice is too neat (like this book) it erodes some of the believability that the author has worked so hard to create...	2002-11-08

As someone who has one (more than one actually) bad books written when she was a teen tucked away for her grandkids to perhaps stumble across and be amused by, I don't think there's anything wrong with keeping your early writing efforts around. The problem lies when you decide they are good enough (or bad enough) to see the light of day.<br />As someone who is no stranger to rejection slips that assure me that good novels are regularly turned away due to reasons other than the writer's ability, I would love to know how this book got published. The right connections? Maybe. It's not like the author is a brand name like Grisham or King, who no matter how many critics trash their books, sell merrily and well. <br />This book is exactly what it claims to be, but I still think the place for a nonfamous writer's juvenalia is the Web or in a trunk. You can get plenty of bad (or not so bad) teen prose just by surfing the Web, you certainly don't need to PAY to read it. Indeed many famous writers in the past have been strenuously opposed to publishing their early novels after the writers became household names. Why, oh why, couldn't this writer wait until she had something truly worthy of being published?	2002-10-27

So anyone who did and dismisses this critique may well be right to for that reason alone. Still, I have read several other Cameron books to the end, and I feel confident stating that most of her points in this book are simply reworked albeit very poetic descriptions of the ones in her books on living the writing life. <br />Those who have already incorporated such techniques as the Morning Pages, Artists' Dates, etc. into their life and found them to be beneficial, do not really need to read this new book, unless it is simply to enjoy Cameron's writing style, (though it's not for everybody). Those who are die hard atheists or agnostics may find her ideas about God hard to bypass in order to consider the others. Those who believe that the craft of writing is like any other craft, requiring serious effort AND innate talent in order to consistently do it well, may be insulted by Cameron's belief that virtually everyone can write well given time alone.<br />Anyway.

Although some were minorities, almost all attended outstanding private schools with supportive staff and guidance counselors who communicated with Wesleyan and other elite college staff via warm personal notes. Which was probably why, as someone who attended public high school ten years ago, which lacked any kind of helpful program to assist its students into getting into the school of their choice, reading this book left a bitter taste in my mouth.<br />Too often, as much as the Wesleyan staff seemed to genuinely care about their job and do it to the best of their abilities, they seemed more than a tad hypocritical in the advice they gave to high school seniors. Don't pin your hopes on just one college, but they were the ones who pinned their hopes on a few outstanding (mostly) prep school stars, many of whom, wanted to go to an Ivy. This just widens the gulf between private and public school applicants, the latter of whom (like me) do just as well once they're finally in a stimulating, diverse college environment.<br />I also found some of the \\"gimmicks\\" these schools used to snare students more than a bit inappropriate. One admissions officer informed a senior via email that he was his \\"absolute favorite,\\" another that he was going to \\"create a fragrance\\" in this boy's name. Even in jest, that seems to cross the line between wooing a student and out and out begging for his presence.<br />For every overachiever that goes on to set the world on fire, there's another who winds up struggling due to financial, emotional or other problems beyond his/her control. I knew a lot of people who went through a period of being exceeingly miserable at the school they chose; ultimately, despite fancy packages meant as bait, it's up to the student himself to make his way.	2002-10-14

Yes, I was slightly jealous; even though half these kids were minorities, almost all attended schools that were outstanding and supportive. Nor did I, like one boy, have a celebrity endorsement from a famous author, nor was I told to start my essays my junior year, nor did my guidance counselor cozy up to the staff of the schools I applied to. Yet, I was accepted where I applied anyway. But standards are higher now, and I wonder if things would still be the same should I apply today.<br />I found this book very intriguing and well-written, a &quot;page turner&quot; as one reviewer mentioned. I admired the subjects who allowed the author to interview them without even using pseudonyms. That's pretty brave, especially when their stories are told warts and all. <br />I believe the admissions staff of Wesleyan does honestly try to do its job well. Yet, I found myself thinking repeatedly how hypocritical these admissions officers are. They tell seniors not to pin their hopes on just one school, and then focus almost all their energy to snare a few prep school stars while ignoring quite a few who could probably do equally as well, given just a fraction of the encouragement and attention they're lavishing on the stars. I knew a lot of people, myself included, who performed fine in high school but really &quot;hit their stride&quot; in college and were much happier and involved with extracurriculars. <br />They also tell students not to use gimmicks, but look at what they do to attract students. They greet the overachieving applicant who's almost too good to be true with hugs and red carpet treatment. They get Chelsea Clinton to endorse the school. They inform a new Wesleyan student via e-mail that he is their &quot;absolute favorite&quot; and that they're going to create a fragrance in his name, and even if it's meant in jest, it's still in my mind, absolutely inappropriate.<br />It's an unenviable job, and certainly I'd probably burn out fast. I'd advise admissions officers not to put all their eggs in one basket when it comes to choosing students for the incoming freshman class. Some of the biggest overachievers are going to make a difference, but some are going to eventually have breakdowns or transfer or drop out. They can woo all they want, but ultimately it's up to the student to figure out how to fit in.	2002-10-07

First of all, it is beautifully written, and very easy to picture the callers, the Crisis Center and those who work the phones. Unfortunately, that's part of the problem.<br /> If I, who am not well-traveled, recognize the approximate area where Ackerman did her crisis work, how much more transparent is it to people who actually live there? The jacket flap says she lives in Ithaca. Given people's penchants for seeing themselves in characters, how could some of the area's inhabitants not recognize themselves, however prettily they are disguised? Also, (spoiler) she helps prevent several suicides, the details of which are rendered very intimately. Even if the disguises hold up, won't some people be nervous about phoning a crisis center, worried that they'll end up as fodder for someone's book? I would be. Sheesh, callers in crisis often feel naked enough.<br /> Also, despite illusions to Ackerman's less than perfect past, I kept wondering how she could have so much empathy for the callers. From what she tells us, she spends her free time, biking, gathering flowers and lolling in the bath. Her callers are dealing with a \\"reality\\" that is considerably more grim.<BR> <BR> But even if you skip the non-crisis center parts, it's still a valuable book for understanding the despair that the human soul can feel.	2002-08-27

From what he tells the reader elsewhere, one can't help but wonder if this is his own (very thinly veiled) autobiography. If so, it's pretty dishonest to simply change the names and call it fiction. Writing fiction ought to take a bit more creativity and spark than that but sadly often doesn't. Revisiting the same old territory again and again (fat kid with wacky Jewish family hates school, but finds people and ideas he can relate to outside of it) may result in faithful readers buying anything you publish, but it doesn't do much to let you grow as a writer.	2002-08-19

Although I know the reviews were biased, I believed them at least when they said it was worth a read. It wasn't. \\"Twelve\\" has been compared to \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" Please. Holden, for all his sarcasm, was ultimately searching for people to connect with. \\"Twelve's\\" protagonist, to quote the author himself, \\"is as thin and pale as smoke.\\" Or something. Character description rarely goes past \\"blond and popular\\" or \\"tall and white.\\" As for what these people think and feel and care about, besides drugs and sex, somehow that has been left out. Yes, teens today are involved in these things, but rich or not, they have other goals, other interests, other things on their mind. Although, I've never been to NYC, so maybe I shouldn't make such a broad comparision. <BR>   <BR>   If the author were Nick Jones, and he had to start off, like 99 percent of unpublished writers do, with a plain old query letter, I'm sure he'd still be making the rounds. If he wasn't 18 and highly connected, and he did get it published, I'm pretty sure it would be panned. Amazing how the hype blinds you, it certainly hypnotized me into buying a copy of \\"Twelve.\\" <br />   Essentially, this is Sweet Valley High meets Reservoir Dogs. No thanks.	2002-07-11

I'm always biting my lip to stifle giggles because my companions wouldn't get the joke. I love Lemony Snicket. I worship at the altar of Dave Barry. But, unlike a lot of readers here, I'm only mildly amused at most of Pinkwater's stuff. I enjoyed the \\"Borgel\\" story, but I was crushed at how lame [sorry] the \\"Snarkout Boys\\" sequel was. I loved the first, thought it was great. But I think it was the constantly switching viewpoint that sank the sequel. It also read like a first draft, particularly the werewolf monologues. That's what bugs me, how much better a lot of the stories could have been. Please, make them just a bit more accessible to new readers; sometimes the wackiness really goes into overload and it's too much to stay with the story. <br /> Secondly, and this only really mattered in the \\"Snarkout\\" sequel, teenagers (at least the ones I know) don't talk like that! Even the biggest [nerd] at my old high school didn't sound like Scott Feldman, or really, Rat or Winston, for that matter. Though maybe they sounded like Pinkwater's high school peers. But if this doesn't matter to the majority of readers, maybe I shouldn't complain either.	2002-07-03

One, the author seems to have a compulsive need to remind the reader that he's fat. OK, if we haven't picked it up from the cover, we get it. Sometimes it was relevant to the piece and sometimes it wasn't.<br /> Secondly, I detected the oh-too-familiar complaint of many writers - that they are unsung geniuses and anyone who criticizes their work doesn't know squat. (I noticed this with Stephen King's and Rita Mae Brown's books on writing.) Some critics don't know what they're doing, but some do. If most people who work in publishing are ignoramuses, how did your books manage to get published? Writers who can make a living doing what they love should ease up on the whining. <BR> <BR> I've read other Pinkwater books. Some are great, some are so-so, and some are in dire need of editing.... In any case, whether or not he's a genius (yes, he actually discusses this) will only tell with time.<br /> And, while I'm really on a roll, why this pathological reluctance to mention his alma mater? I went there. It's a decent school. Lots of flaky artists, but certainly nothing to be ashamed of.	2002-06-25

I can't think of ANY teenage girl who'd push her friend into her dad's tent on a camping trip and snuggle up in her sleeping bag in satisfaction at the thought of them sleeping together. That seemed to reveal that the author was a male with all the typical male attitudes toward sex. I had a friend in an almost identical situation in high school and she was thoroughly grossed out. <br /> Two, I couldn't buy Saskia's sudden rise to high school popularity. She seemed far too introverted, eccentric and strong willed to even consider it or be able to achieve it in the first place. Her reasons for trying it were weak, almost nonexistent. Perhaps she was trying, unconsciously or not, to get her dad to notice her, but this was never really explored. If she was doing it for an experiment, it seemed like there were far more worthy things that would capture her imagination. The first half of the book proved this.<br /> Still I give it four stars because there are so few amazing female characters in fiction nowadays.	2002-03-10

Each one seems represented by a single characteristic, kind of like a Monopoly piece. Apart from that, it's impossible to tell which witticism came from who if you covered up the source. <br />I guess it doesn't really matter though. Why work to create truly in-depth teenage characters whose words and actions might say even more penetrating things about today's adolescent society? Why attempt to add depth when you can just lob one smart alecky grenade after another? Why show the vulnerabilities behind the witticisms rather than just caraciaturing your protagonists? <br />I'm all for humor. Humor is great. Black humor's even better. But in order for a book to really succeed, to stay on someone's \\"best book I ever read list\\" five years from now, there has to be something else to keep us reading.	2002-02-27

Paul was a well-drawn character, easy to sympathize with and easy to care about. However, I longed for a little ambiguity when it came to Eric. He was clearly an adolescent psychopath, yet having the line drawn between good and evil so clearly is dull; you can just turn on the TV or rent a movie. Books work when there's depth to more than the narrator: that way we have to think about what's going on rather than just going along for the ride. <br /> Also, I found it odd that there was no police investigation into the multiple deaths until the end, but then I don't live in a football-worshipping town. Tangerine made me very glad I didn't.<BR> <BR> Last, I also felt the author pulled the rug out from under us with the character of Joey - first he was a likeable guy, and then a racist jerk with an attitude. But you had to give Bloor credit there for not being predictable.	2002-02-11

Every week I receive poems from young people, as sappy as MS's and as heartfelt. We publish them because we are a family newspaper that serves mostly small communities. The kids are happy, the parents pin them to the fridge, and we've done our good deed for the day.<br />BUT they do not deserve book publication. They are cute, they bring a smile to your face, but that's all. They have the depth of a Triscuit. They vanish from your mind as soon as you turn the page. So it was with this book.<br />I wish the child nothing but the best in his journey. But I can't help wondering if he is being exploited. If he had the talent of a young Rimbaud or Dickinson, I wouldn't mind. But so far, he doesn't.	2002-02-08

The italics for one. They're the literary equivalent of someone whispering in your ear when you're trying to watch on a movie, they jolt you from your absorption and leave you unsure of what is going on.<br />Second, this collection is very uneven. A few stories are very good, several are passable, and many are downright infuriating to try and grasp the point of. I don't believe &quot;literary fiction&quot; has to wear its incomprehensibility and pretentiousness like a badge of honor, in order to garner admiration. <br />Thirdly, the characters have little to no depth, with the exception of a few narrators. We get their physical descriptions, what music they like, and where they shop, yet nothing about what they believe in, what they enjoy doing in their spare time, their political stands, etc. Brand names do not a multi-dimensional character make.<br />My recommendation: Skip it.	2002-02-07

I might be missing the point, but it mostly just made me happy I never spent much time wanting to be part of the popular crowd in high school. I found it depressing in the extreme that after all Torey went through (seeing a dead body, being in a psych ward, getting to know an amazingly compassionate outcast - Bo) he STILL treats a non-popular dormmate at his boarding school like excrement - in a scene that seems to be a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" ripoff -he STILL feels superior because he has friends, musical aptitude, etc. Perhaps the author is to be commended for not slamming the reader with a stereotypical message about become a better person, but I find it hard to believe that Torey didn't change at all considering he seemed to have more sensitivity than the rest of his crowd. He feels a bit guiltier, perhaps, about dismissing others onthe outside, but that seems to be it. <br />Some of the writing seemed awfully clunky, too, particularly in the mental hospital chapter at the end. How can you make someone having a psychotic (?) episode dull? Oh well. The author's sympathies also seemed to lie mostly with the outcasts, so the story might have worked better from their viewpoint.	2002-01-07

It had its high points, but I kept tripping up against minor but still relevant questions. If a woman (Charlene Gardner) is a knockout wouldn't she do anything BUT shrivel a man's private parts? Same with some of the high school details. Everyone I knew stopped wearing unicorn shirts after they hit puberty, regardless of their clique. And I just couldn't buy that Tick didn't already have email considering how much of today's teens' social life revolves around the computer. Okay, enough fixation on small flaws. EF reminded me of &quot;I Know This Much is True.&quot; But the hero of the latter earned his insights and carthasis through painful therapy, whereas Miles Roby just seemed to bump along his disintegrating life with as much insight into where he was going and how he got that way as a canoe. He was annoyingly inert. He only changed when Russo wanted to nudge the plot along. Last, having been greatly entertained by Tick's perception of high school, I was disappointed that we didn't really get her verdict on the final tragedy - especially considering that she was the heroine.	2001-08-24

At first &quot;Prozac Diary's&quot; amazing way with language clouded me to its very real flaws. Yet as I read it again, I was a bit disgusted. Date rape is reduced to a metaphor about riding on the backs of stags. And very little of the pain of depression while leading a &quot;regular&quot; life comes through, instead we get this kind of elitist attitude that those who work full time and have families are prosaic and plebian. Given the implied financial bracket of Slater, I must point out that people who set their alarm clocks for work are not existentially inferior, just people who need to pay the rent - and that includes a lot of the mentally ill. It was almost like Slater was afraid to include the more mundane and humiliating details of her recovery without prettying them up, lest we take her as less &quot;special.&quot;  For example, her attendance at Harvard was mentioned, but not Boston University (except on the back flap). For some reason, that really annoyed me.	2001-07-17

I'm going to have to duck for stones after this is posted, but I've never seen a book that started out so strongly and then  went nowhere. The protagonist was unforgettable; her observations had me howling during the first few chapters. Too bad every other character in the book was a stereotype: the wild child best friend (who lights up right away so we know she's a degenerate); the benevolent, aphorism spouting pothead; the evil abusive dad. I'm all for showing the unattractive side of life (and if you can do it with as much black humor as Barry, all the better), but &quot;Cruddy&quot; needed a few more fleshed out characters. Even one. It's like Barry was so busy concentrating on the inhumanity in her story, she lost sight of the humans.	2001-07-02

Secondly, he has to have at least one noticeable flaw, in other words he has to come off as human. Ellis Whitman is undeniably cool but utterly forgettable once you close &quot;Goats&quot; because he lacks both of these. The reader learns a great deal about what CDs he listens to, what kind of pot he prefers, etc., but not much else. From start to finish, he makes decisions which are mature for the average teenager. Throughout the book, almost everything goes his way, down to his Latin grade being raised from an A minus to an A. This was so foreign from my adolescence that I just couldn't care. The goats were the only thing in the book with any life.	2001-03-30

After 50 pages, I no longer cared what brand of jeans Walker was wearing, what color her current boyfriend/best friend was, or what drugs she was taking at the time of their relationship. Her teenage escapades blurred together because not a single character was developed and explored. Nor were Walker's feelings of ambivalence other than a few token tries thrown in here and there. She goes from someone who apparently did anything to fit in to a high school senior militantly proud of her African American identity. And we are glad she has apparently resolved some major issues. However we are left with absolutely no clue as to why. In the end, I couldn't figure out if I was missing something or if there was simply nothing to miss.	2001-02-21

At first I was impressed and engaged, but then became irritated and distracted. Particularly after she began describing her adolecence, Karr came off as a hyperactive kid at the dinner table desperate for attention, giving us a suicide attempt here, a drug overdose there, but never once speaking plainly and honestly about the pain that these events must have entailed.<br />I found it disturbing that someone who attended an elementary school where three students passed away from cancer and was a regular witness to poverty and hardship, could become narcisstic enough as a teenager to believe that because she was smart, she and her genius friend were the only ones to ever have suffered. Maybe she was smart, but she sure lacked compassion. Such indifference made it impossible for me to sympathize with her.

Through her straightforward, yet eloquent descriptions of surviving cancer, she emerges as perceptive and courageous, as say Anne Frank (although I'm sure she'd be embarrassed at such a comparision). What impressed me the most, was how alone she seemed undergoing chemotherapy and the subsequent operations to rebuild her jaw. Her parents are portrayed as ill equipped to deal with her illness, the very people she should have been able to turn to for comfort and support. That she had such a rich inner world as a substitute is amazing, and though the memoir leaves us uncertain of how she went on to navigate life with a restored jaw, we are never left in any doubt that she made it.	2000-12-27

Jamison is blessed with a hyperintelligent, loving family, wonderful colleagues, supportive boyfriends, and amazing doctors. As someone with bipolar, who has none of the above, I found it hard to relate to her memoir. Most people I know with mental illness, despite their innate gifts, are not so lucky. Indeed most people I know without mental illness aren't as lucky either.<br />As a result of bestowing three to five complimentary adjectives upon most of the characters and glossing over the few painful interactions included, Jamison's book comes off like a Disney World version of manic depression. Indeed it is courageous of her to &quot;come out&quot; like this only if things really aren't as wonderful as she's presented them here.<br />Tracy Thompson's and Martha Manning's memoirs of depression do a much better job of portraying the pain and frustration of a mood disorder, and were a lot more honest and well-written.

A novel dealing with how the Net has shaped infidelity should be an intriguing read - I haven't seen too many books on it - but this wasn't one of them. Fictional teenagers don't have to be portrayed as rebellious, tormented loners, but Henry seemed too far in the other direction, he appeared to have amazingly few conflicts (apart from the major one). I found it odd that so little was mentioned about college, considering that is one of the highlights of most high school seniors' year. Yes, his mother was having an affair, but didn't he have any separate plans of his own? I agree with those reviewers who said Elvira was the most fascinating character in the book. Perhaps because there seem to be so few vividly drawn adolescent females in contemporary fiction, she was the one who kept me skimming, at least until I found out what happened to her. After that I closed the book.	2000-11-13

I felt for several, but I didn't like them. The narrator, on who presumably the most time was spent  creating, was more of a Christ figure than an actual unhappy gay male. His three friends were even more narrowly drawn. Even after high school, they seemed locked into their hatred, unable to realize that they had the option of moving on with their lives. I hesitate to draw comparisions, but perhaps that was the author's main problem as well.	2000-10-28

This was hard to swallow.<br />As for the rest, the descriptions (as usual) were beautiful, but there were just too many characters whose stories weren't woven together enough for me to sustain interest in them. Keeping the focus on Betsy Chase, Abel or Carlin might have helped. As it is, Elizabeth George's mystery &quot;Well Schooled in Murder,&quot; tells a very similiar story and does it better.	2000-10-28

Then I started to think about its message. Why are there no books out trumpeting the idea that everyone can learn how to be a good athlete if they just try hard and love the sport enough? We'd laugh if someone wrote that everyone had it in them to be a football player if they just followed a magic formula.   Yet because most people can communicate by writing, everyone can eventually become a poet, a novelist or screenwriter? I don't think so. Yes, we can all learn to write more clearly and skillfully. But not everyone has an aptitude for this area. If the arts were as respected in our society as athletics, maybe more could see this.   I think it's wonderful if people read this book and discover how much fun it is to write. But I could practice free throws for the rest of my life, and not have the ability to play pro basketball. Similarly, someone can write poetry for that long and not become Walt Whitman. Enjoyment is great. But talent is necessary too.	2000-10-07
