It's some of Cussler's greatest work and in my opinion a hell of a lot more fun than going and seeing some plotless summer action movie. It's setting are great, the villain and her to two henchman are very creative, and the main characters, Kurt and Joe, are almost if not just as good as Dirk Pitt. Kurt is more of a normal guy, not superhuman like Pitt. The plot is not as outrageous as some of his other books and it's got a great ending. The only downside to this book is that it's way too short!! I could have read this book for weeks.	2001-07-05

Next, the setting, the Sahara desert and an African river, are both very intriguing and great settings. Then, the plot is riveting and will keep you glued to this book for hours. This is the best Dirk Pitt adventure that I've read so far. The villain, as always, is great and the ending is the finest I've read.	2001-06-27

I really enjoyed the historical part of it and thought it the plot was pretty clever. I liked how the hid the cruise ship and the ending was pretty cool. But, it could have been better. I dont know how it could've been better. I just know it had great potential but didn't fully fill that potential. Anyway, it's still a great book.	2001-06-27

There's always some sort of mystery, always something you don't know. But, the end was really what brought it down to four stars. It was all good up to the last few chapters. But maybe it's supposed to be that way, maybe the ending isn't supposed to set well with the reader. Anyway, this book has made me more wary of trial verdicts. Overall it's a good book and is worth your time.	2001-06-13

But, as I have said in some of my other reviews of his books, it's good to get out of reality sometimes. This book has a very good plot, but I think the best parts are at the beginning and end. It also brought out a good point that illegal immigration is a ver big problem in the United STates. There are actually smuggling rings that smuggle illegal immigrants in the U.S. It is a problem that really needs to be dealt with.	2001-05-02

This book has much more depth to it than his other novels. It is rich in culture and makes you feel as though you are right there with LUke. The symbolism flows freely, along with spurts of action and intrigue. A great book that not only is a great novel just for entertainment, but also for connecting on a deeper level. I recommend this to everyone.	2001-05-01

Although it's a pretty good book and a quick read, it's very unrealistic. Dr. Cook usually presents his moral controversies in a very realistic way. But this one seemed to stray far from the point. It's by no means a bad book and I recommend it but if you've never read a Cook book, start with something like Contagion, Chromosome six, or Acceptable Risk.	2001-05-01

First of all, this is a very quick read. I could hardly put the book down. it kept me on the edge of my seat all the time. It really surprised me(this is my first Grisham book). Next, this provokes a lot of emotion, you have to pick how to feel about Sam. Should you hate him for killing the two boys, or should you feel pity for a poor, dying, and later on, repentant old man. I hate to give away the ending, but, the end is very, very sad. I can say that it moved me to tears. Besides all these other things, I can say this book has made me a strong opponent of the death penalty. THis book is a must read for anyone, I mean anyone. It will touch anyone, unless they have a heart of stone. I beg all who haven't, to READ THIS BOOK!!!!!	2001-03-01

It stated the facts clearly and accurately. It was honest. It did not try to sidestep the fact that Al Gore smoked marijuana, that he has overexaggerate many facts. It also brought out all of his good points too. I will quickly mention that I was for Al Gore in the 2000 election.But, when you get right down to it, &quot;The Prince of Tennessee&quot; is campaign propoganda. It's just here to glorify Al Gore, which I have no problem with. It tries to disguise itself by being so brutally honest, but don't let it decieve you. Campaign propoganda, whether it's negative or positive, is never really good reading. It's almost always one-sided and can get very boring. This holds true now. REally good biographies are written after the subject is dead.	2001-03-01

It has plenty of action, an interesting historical portion, the intrigue of lost treasure, and foreign countries are always interesting. This is the first Clive Cussler book that I have read. The first thing that I noticed was that this book was ridiculously unrealistic. Dirk Pitt is just about perfect. He always knows what to do, has the &quot;cool&quot; hobbies, a girlfriend, he's hansom, and he always says the right thing. He always manages to get out of almost impossible situations. It really began to bother me after a while. Some of the comments he makes are sort of corny. But, this is an instance where you should throw reality out the window. All books don't need to be realistic. Just read and have fun. This book is definitely worth your time.	2001-02-08

As everyone knows, this is about Governer Jack Stanton, who bears a startling resemblance to Bill Clinton. Anyway, this book was a lot of fun to read. It had great dialogue, and some of the best characters I've seen. Gov. Stanton is a good man who made mistakes but he is an extremely likeable person. Henry Burton, is a good narrarator and has an interesting story but I didn't think he was all that wonderful. Richard(can't remember last name) is an interesting character too, he reminds me of Dale from KIng of the Hill. Libby, adds the spice to the book. She, in her own unique way, fueled the campaign. She is surprisingly likeable character. Anyone interested in modern politics or just a good book should read this.	2001-01-12

Last December I was doing a twenty page report on Robert Kennedy and I used Sons and Brothers as one of my sources. But i finished reading the book last week. I enjoyed this book because although it presented some of the Kennedys' dark side it showed them both as good men. It also presents the case for conspiracy. This book was by no means boring and anyone interested in the Kennedys should read this. This also got me to thinking how different America would be today if Robert Kennedy had become president instead of Richard Nixon.	2001-01-11

Although, sometimes it got a little too far fetched for my taste, especially the part where he goes into space and with the cannibals. But besides that, it's great. Although, I can't truthfully say it's better than the movie. It's about the same. Both are very good. Both are worth your time.	2001-01-11

I loved almost all of this book, although some parts got a little repetative and dragged, such as &quot;My conversation with Rush Limbaugh&quot; and the part where his assistant Jeff talked.

It told of his experiences in Hawaii,Pennsylvania, Florida, and and Canada. It starts out by telling about professional wrestling being in his blood and all. Then, it tells of his childhood and early adolescence in Hawaii. Next, it tells how he moved to Bethlehem, Pennyslvania and how he played football there throughout his high school years. Then it tells about his college days in Miami. I found this part particularly interesting since I was born in Miami. Anyway, this is where he meets his future wife and how her parents don't like him and all this other stuff. But I won't tell much more because I don't want to ruin it. So, to make a long story short, he was drafted by the CFL, came back down to Florida, trained in Tampa(I'm from Tampa too) to be a pro wrestler, and then joined the WWF. Anyway, this is a great book; although, unlike Mick Foley's book, you should probably be a wrestling fan if you truly want to appreciate this book.	2000-10-21

It is about this medical student, who stumbles upon some suspicious findings which turn out to be a big conspiracy thing. This book is a little outdated, and it gets slow at times but overall it is a very good book. But, my favorite part is the ending. It's sort of obvious once you get to it and I kept wondering how I didn't figure it out before hand. It's not really the ending itself; it's the whole conspiracy that was very surprising. It is evil, yet ingenious.	2000-10-14

This book is one of my favorite Wells books.It is about this guy who gets 'trapped' on this island. and this island is inhabited by an infamous scientist/doctor who was 'exiled' from England. Anyway, the doctor is Moreau. And this Moreau guy gets animals and tries to make them more human. What really bothered me about this is that he really had no reason for doing this. It might be a different case if he was actually benifitting the world by doing this. But no, he was just doing this for his own personal curiosity. This also immedietly made me think of our own conflicting opinions and moral dillemas we have with genetic engineering.	2000-10-14

But I was wrong. the book was kind of boring and it didn't seem complete. it was all about parties and stuff. It was also sort of vague. I felt as though I didn't know any of the characters. I just got a very brief history. I couldn't grasp them. This is the first time I have ever encountered this. This book was just plain boring. And yes, I did finish it, for those who read my 'Brothers Karamazov' review and hated it. But, I will not give up on Fitzgerald. I soon plan on reading 'This Side of Paradise,' or 'The Beautiful and the Damned.' Hopefully they will be more interesting than this one.	2000-10-14

Although the words are sometimes large and confusing this is a wonderful story. I was disappointed when it ended. Not only do you get the interesting story of the Eloi and Morlocks, but, to my delight, there is still more. in the final chapters of the book he goes even farther into the future. I thought this part was really cool with the sun dying and all.<br />Now, for the 12 year-old reviewers. I am somewhat disappointed in you. This book is NOT boring. I am 14 and I can identify with the first reviewer in that, as I mentioned before, there were a lot of hard words. I had to go to the dictionary more than once. But you second reviewer. Calling the time machine boring. you must have gotten some weird version or something. Maybe you're just not used to that type of writing or something. But please, read it again, do something.

I could hardly stand it. It was sooooooo  boring. Maybe I'm not patient or something but after 200 pages it didn't  seem to be going anywhere. All I had learned was that the brothers didn't  like their father. I found almost all the characters to rather cynical and  depressing. The only character who I thought was okay was Alyosha. Don't  think i put down books immediatly if I don't like them either. I HATE to  put down books. My conscience wouldn't get off my back after I quit this.

It is  about a young man driven by poverty to believe he is exempt from the law.

It was boring at times and I ALWAYS knew whatwas happening. There was no  mystery. It wasn't really bad but, it surely didn't live up to the  standard's of the previous books in the series, Contagion, Chromosome 6. It  was interesting because I learned some about bioterrorism and militias but,  like i said, there was nothing for you to try to figure out. But I will  commend Dr. Cook on something he does in his books every once and a while  and he did very good on this one. His little glossary, author's note, and  bibliograpy. Those are always pretty cool. Although unfortunately during  Vector those were the parts I looked forward to . I don't want to say  'don't waste you money and time' because it's fun to read about jack and  laurie but for those of us with little patience I say don't read it.

The idea that a disease as deadly as the 'andromeda strain' is very unsettling. 'The Andromeda Strain' is also very realistic and it doesn't seem that  unlikely to me. But it seems like I hardly knew anything about the main  characters. They were sort of mysterious in regards to their background.  They told what they did and where they were from but he didn't really help  me to know them real well like in his other books. It was also a little  boring at times. But besides those problems it was a greaet book.	2000-07-31

This book is shameful compared to Jurassic Park. I found this book to be uninteresting and a little weird. One of the first problems is  that ian Malcom died! I found his miraculous recovery very hard to swallow.  I also think it would have been better if the dinosaurs somehow survived on  the original island. Also, why did he change the chaos theory to the  'complexity' thoery!  I didn't have a big problem with that I just found it  kind of weird. The ending was also pretty bad too with the disease and all.  I found it very anticlimatic. I also so think that they should have  included another character from Jurassic Park along with Dr. Malcom. And,  in Jurassic Park the T-REx couldn't see you if you stood still but in Lost  World that suddenly changes! I did like the new dinosaurs that were added  and of course I thought Crichton's illustrations were interesting. Overall  it's not that bad of a book but it can't compare to Jurassic Park.	2000-07-26

There were also many other things that happened in the book that never  happened in the movie.The ending was also different too. Ian Malcom's quips  and witty remark's were very entertaining and humorous. the book is 10  times better than the movie.	2000-07-26
