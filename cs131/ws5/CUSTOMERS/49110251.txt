In \\"Something Rotten,\\" the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate Earth of 1988 and the world of Fiction are completely in place.<br /><br />When last we left the intrepid Thursday Next, she had just saved the world of Fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction. Pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil Goliath Corporation, Thursday's finally given birth to a son, Friday, who at two year old only speaks in Lorem Ipsum (a good example of the craziness of Fforde's vision.) Deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin, she returns to Earth and winds up becoming:<br /><br />* The target of an assassin<br /><br />* The coach of her town's professional croquet team<br /><br />* The thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional<br /><br />* The hostess to Hamlet, Prince of Denmark<br /><br />* The on-again, off-again wife to her exterminated, unexterminated husband<br /><br />* The finder of a live clone of William Shakespeare<br /><br />* The friend of Neanderthals everywhere<br /><br />* Dead--twice<br /><br />* The holder of the secrets of the apocalypse<br /><br />* The once-again savior of the planet<br /><br />If you think that's about three books in one, well that pegs \\"Something Rotten.\\" Fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once. That Fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series, \\"The Eyre Affair.\\"<br /><br />While not as inventive as his previous book, \\"The Well of Lost Plots,\\" Fforde's world-building is largely done, so \\"Something Rotten\\" can focus on the story and not on backstory--that's a big plus. Longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book. For instance, we finally get to see who Millon de Floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an England overrun with mammoths, dodos, and Neanderthals.<br /><br />All the typical humor that we've come to expect from Fforde is here and he's done well picking up the mantle of Douglas Adams. Someone has to write nutty British sci-fi and Fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now. And while \\"Something Rotten\\" is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the Thursday Next books, for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books.<br /><br />Enjoy!that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book.

Part author memoir, part Christian devotional, and part biography of Fred Rogers, the book takes readers on a journey through the life of author and the Christian discipleship of the man behind \\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\\"<br /><br />Asked in 1994 by her employer to do an interview with Fred Rogers, a man not given to interviews, Hollingsworth was able to secure that interview by sticking up for Rogers in an editorial response she wrote to a snarky article by a New York journalist that condemned Rogers as nothing more than a panderer to self-esteem and the latest pop psychology. So the author lays out the beginnings of her friendship with the gentle man whom she later credits with saving children's television, particularly PBS's version of it.<br /><br />Her stories of Rogers get to the one side of his persona that he kept very quiet, his Christian faith. In his younger days, Rogers  started off as a puppeteer on a children's show and saw the need to bring the Gospel into the way that television reached out to children. To this end, he enrolled in seminary, only to find resistance to his being ordained. The ordination board did not know what to do with a man who did not want to pastor a local church, but instead wanted to pastor every person who watched a children's TV show he led. But Rogers's insistence that the Holy Spirit was able to speak truth even through the airwaves convinced the seminary board; he was ordained in the United Presbyterian Church.<br /><br />The show he became famous for first debuted in Canada, then came to PBS via WQED in Pittsburgh. Rogers lived right down the street and walked to the studio every day. And that was the kind of person Rogers was. He was always given to the simple, the quiet, and the vulnerable even as a child. From the people in the neighborhood he grew up in, he learned that the small things matter. Hollingsworth relates Rogers's encounter with an elderly woman who taught young Freddie how to make his favorite breakfast, toast sticks, using this encounter as a backbone of the book.<br /><br />The best parts of this book are the little revelations. Hollingsworth tells of Rogers and his seminary buddies going on a road trip to hear a famous pastor speak, only to find a substitute preacher--and a boring one at that--putting the congregation to sleep. Rogers was incensed by this, only to turn to the woman seated next to him and notice her crying because the message spoke to the deepest part of her need. Rogers decided at that point that it was unwise to be judgmental because he could never know how the Holy Spirit was touching someone. Hollingsworth also tells stories that viewers of \\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\\" relate concerning how the show changed their lives. Some of these stories, particularly the teenager who was horribly abused by his parents throughout his early years, are worthy of five hankies. Another revelation is that Rogers cultivated deep friendships with many famous people. Of particular note to me was that Rogers was close friends with Henri Nouwen, the Catholic priest and author of classic books like \\"The Wounded Healer\\" and \\"The Return of the Prodigal Son.\\"<br /><br />One of the other truths that comes out of this book is that God blessed Fred Rogers with an enormous creative gift. He wrote 900 episodes of his show, penned over 200 songs, performed the classic background piano music, and was the voice behind most of the puppets in the Land of Make Believe. Hollingsworth does an excellent job showing how that creative bent allowed Rogers to draw children to him and share the Gospel of Jesus in the same way that the Lord blessed the little children who were presented to Him. Knowing that Rogers got up every day at 5AM to read the Bible and pray only reinforces the reality that he brought that time before God into everyshow he made.<br /><br />If there are any complaints against \\"The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers\\" they lie in the brevity of the book and the lightness of the entire narrative. Fred Rogers is about as teflon a personality as ever walked the earth (the author even discusses the urban legend that thieves stole Rogers's car, only to return it the next day when they learned it was his), but more discussion of the man's flaws and how he used his faith to overcome them would have been appreciated. This book is as close to fawning as any biographical work you'll ever read.<br /><br />That said, I met Fred Rogers when I was at Carnegie Mellon University. See, I literally lived in Mister Rogers's neighborhood of Shadyside in the Pittsburgh suburbs. I'd see Rogers walk to work at WQED almost every day since my dorm room was right next to the PBS station's studio where he taped his show. Getting to talk with him from time to time proved to me that he was everything we saw on TV and more--an example for all the people who ever watched \\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\\" and grew up to be better people because of the simple faith of Fred Rogers.<br /><br />A very good book about a very good man.

I'm a conservative and I normally like most of the conservative books I read. I wanted to like Mona Charen's _Do-Gooders_, but the book failed in so many ways that I got about a third through and just could not devote any more time to it. Skimming the last two-thirds proved that once you've read a few pages, you've read the whole book.<br /><br />Charen attempts to lay out how all the finagling by \\"Big 'L' Liberals\\" is responsible for about every social ill we have today. She does a decent job making her case that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Liberals found every road to that particular destination.<br /><br />But therein lies the problem with _Do-Gooders_. Even a conservative who's been in a comatose state for the last decade will recognize all her talking points. Everything here is old news. Yes, we know how Rudy Giuliani cleaned up Dinkin's mayoral mess in NYC.  We know the myth concerning black churches being systematically burned in the South by racist groups. We know that gun control advocates are wrong. And Robert Bork sure did get the shaft, didn't he? That's all common knowledge and old news, though. In fact, it seems like this book was written ten years ago.<br /><br />There are other issues. Charen is a capable writer, but she seems really forced in spots here, especially when she's trying to channel Ann Coulter. But Coulter she is not; her attempts at being arch fall flat and she repeatedly writes with trepidation, as if she knows she can't be as funny or quick with a knife to the belly like Coulter can. Instead, she goes more for facts. However, her points are belabored in some places and poorly supported in others. She could have tried for the academic approach or stayed within a screed-like style, but what she delivers here tries to be all things to all people and it just does not satisfy anyone, particularly a conservative audience that has higher expectations.<br /><br />Truly, this book has no audience. It's not scholarly enough to please conservatives looking for a Bloom-like approach, moderates will be turned off by her attempts at Coulter (I found her comment about Jesse Jackson \\"mau-mauing corporations\\" to be particularly ill-advised), and Liberals wouldn't read this if they were paid to do so.<br /><br />So who should read this book? I have no idea. I certainly can't recommend it. There is no doubt it is a worthy topic, but this book is simply too lightweight to be a solid reference. The talking points seem ancient in light of GWB's re-election, too.<br /><br />Normally, I like conservative books, but I can't recommend _Do-Gooders_ to anyone. Pick up something by P.J. O'Rourke instead.  You'll learn just as much and be far more entertained in the process.rly enough to please conservatives looking for a Bloom-like approach, moderates will be turned off by her attempts at Coulter (I found her comment about Jesse Jackson \\"mau-mauing corporations\\" to be particularly ill-advised), and Liberals wouldn't read this if they were paid to do so. <br /> <br />So who should read this book?

In an age when Christians no longer espouse a unified Christian worldview (or would even know how to if they wished to), this book bursts on the scene and blows apart our complacency.<br /><br />A former student of Francis Schaeffer and writing partner of Chuck Colson, Pearcey brings an academic's mind to the issue of how people think about reality, but without pompous language and impossible-to-follow philosophical noodlings. Her basic premise is that throughout time Man has viewed the worlds of the Natural and the Supernatural as two compartments with little or no connection. Plato, Aquinas, Kant, Marx, and Darwin have all made attempts at explaining how Fact and Faith inform each other, but all have been flawed and none have the perspective that Christianity can uniquely and perfectly fulfill. Only Christians can explain both Fact and Faith through the model of Creation, Fall, and Redemption, addressing all parts of reality with Total Truth.<br /><br />What is genius about this book is not that it breaks new ground, but that it is methodical in laying out all its facts in a way that is easily comprehend by those not familiar with philosophy. Each section of the book is clear and concise. The first section outlines the importance of a coherent worldview and why this issue is so critical to the future of public discourse and right thinking, especially among Christians who have become accustomed to using their faith as the icing on a rather distasteful cake of disjointed, syncretistic thinking. The second part looks at the various epistemologies that have been prominent in history, while the third looks at what constitutes a truly Christian worldview. In this last section, the author even shows how some Christian ministries are run by worldviews that are not even remotely Christian. Here, her insights into how the world of business can be helped by leaders schooled in a unified Christian worldview is almost prophetic and desperately needs to be heard by those at the helm of modern American Christian thought.<br /><br />The first two sections of this work are brilliant, while the third needs to be developed and laid out more systematically for those who may not have the tools to construct a unified Christian worldview on their own (whether due to lack of knowledge or the need to deconstruct their own flawed worldview before installing a new one.) Still, despite the few flaws, this book is essential reading for every Christian. The dual needs for a uniquely Christian worldview and the ability to combat the weakness of non-Christian worldviews cannot be underestimated. If the Church is to survive postmodernism and the cultural trends that assail us, right thinking is critical. Thanks to Nancy Pearcey that worthy goal is now more achievable.<br /><br />A must for every Christian's personal library, you'll go back to it again and again. Don't wait; buy it today--your mind is a terrible thing to waste.worldview is almost prophetic and desperately needs to be heard by those at the helm of modern American Christian thought. <br /> <br />The first two sections of this work are brilliant, while the third needs to be developed and laid out more systematically for those who may not have the tools to construct a unified Christian worldview on their own (whether due to lack of knowledge or the need to deconstruct their own flawed worldview before installing a new one.)

Karma Wilson and Joan Rankin's simple, yet witty tale of a frog that bites off more than he can chew is absolutely charming. From his insatiable appetite (\\"what a hog that frog\\") that slurps one tick, two fleas, three flies, four slugs and five snails right into an ever-expanding gullet, to the surprise of his life at the end of the tale, this frog on a half-sunk log in the middle of a bog is slimy fun.<br /><br />Not only are the watercolors by Rankin picture perfect and lighthearted, but the Cajun-inspired meter of Wilson's verse just lilts right off the old tongue, even if the closest you've ever been to \\"N'Awlins\\" is New York City. Everything in this book works, from the word play to the expressions on the faces of the bugs crammed inside the frog's stomach.<br /><br />Nothing gives me more pleasure than to have my child so excited to read a book, even if he's heard the story a thousand times. As a youngster starting to read in spurts, this book has encouraged him to read it all by himself. He wanted to make sure he knew all the words. What better recommendation can a parent give than that a book inspires a child to want to be a better reader!<br /><br />I probably would not have picked this one up at first glance, but now I know that dad doesn't always judge books well by their covers. So I guess even a four-year old can teach a forty-two year old a thing or two about great literature.<br /><br />Get the book. Your kids will love it (as Justin Wilson, the Cajun Chef used to say), \\"I geh-rawn-tee!\\"	2005-02-04

One of the most influential sci-fi books ever published, \\"Neuromancer\\" rocked the world when it was released in the early Eighties, creating an entirely new genre of sci-fi, cyberpunk. At a time when computers were primitive and the Internet was not even imagined, William Gibson created a world where life becomes digital and vice versa. Designer drugs, designer body modifications, and a melding of human and machine influence a society that lives largely to the senses and to vices unspeakable. Grim and gray, Gibson's future Earth and its surrounds makes \\"Bladerunner\\" look like Disneyworld.<br /><br />Into this necrotic world comes Case, a self-styled cyber-\\"cowboy\\" whose hacking ability extends to entering computer systems with his mind and cracking their security. He works for anyone with the right wad of cash. Now with his skills burned out by a group seeking retribution against his crimes, he wanders through the back streets of an Asian cesspool doing minor drug deals, all the while knowing that he's one step away from becoming a casualty of his lifestyle.<br /><br />Enter a secretive benefactor who offers to restore Case's ability to \\"jack in\\" and manipulate computer systems, and a sleek assassin with knives implanted in her finger tips. Together, they put together a team bent on attacking an Artificial Intelligence module that may contain secrets that will vindicate the benefactor. Case revels in the opportunity only then to learn his restored abilities, like the tapes on \\"Mission Impossible,\\" are set to self-destruct. Complete the mission and he can keep his skills. Fail, and....<br /><br />\\"Neuromancer\\" lurches from Earth to space and weaves a tale so frayed around the edges most readers will be scratching their heads as to what is really happening. And this is a shame since the book truly is prophetic (even if parts of those prophecies are lifted from other sources, mostly.) With hard to follow events, a jangle of locations, purposefully cryptic references, and a coolness factor that proved that this reader was simply not as cool as the material, Gibson's multi-award-winning novel comes off as little more than an exercise in style. While reading the book, I decided at one point to just jump around the narrative, skipping ahead pages, then jumping back. The outcome? The story made just about as much sense read in scattershot form as read serially, one page at a time.<br /><br />I started reading Gibson with his latest book, \\"Pattern Recognition,\\" which I thought was atrocious. Willing to give the benefit of the doubt, I jumped back in time to this one. While \\"Neuromancer\\" has a slightly more satisfying ending, time has shown that Gibson is an acquired taste, and that only to precious few. Despite having spawned the genre that gave us the movie \\"The Matrix\\" (and you'll be shocked at how much of \\"Neuromancer\\" was lifted for that film), great ideas cannot make up for a slapdash plot and one-dimensional characterizations.

US	49110251	R236GTJQ4OPD34	0553580515	417245650	Passage	Books	2	75	89	N	N	A Near-Death Experience for the reader...	What kind of book do you get when you combine a talented, multi-Hugo/Nebula-award-winning author like Connie Willis; the shadowy, supernatural world of Near-Death Experiences (NDEs); a race against time; and one of the world's greatest disasters?<br /><br />Hold on, we'll get to the answer later....<br /><br />In Willis's \\"Passage,\\" NDE researcher Dr. Joanna Lander is asked to join Dr. Richard Wright's research project into the nature of NDEs. Wright has found a way to recreate NDEs via a designer chemical and is now looking to explore whether they have a purpose beyond that of ushering the dying into the afterlife. Dr. Lander's best friend in the ER, Vielle, also wants to see the young Joanna pair up with  the hunky new doc on the block and soon Dr. Lander is helping Wright extract critical medical and psychological info from a less-than-ideal set of volunteers. Obstructing all the work is Maurice Mandrake, a bestselling author (and quack), who has made a small fortune selling his books to the gullible. Mandrake does not wish to see Lander and Wright come up with any results that would render his obsession with hokey New Age images of angels and \\"life flashing before one's eyes\\" less profitable.<br /><br />But with the financing review for the project hurtling toward them, and the sudden withdrawal of some of the progressively fearful test subjects, Lander and Wright make a fateful decision: the best chronicler of the events would be someone well-versed in the science of NDEs. Lander assents, only to find herself caught in the horror of one of the most famous disasters of all time. Each further test reveals more of the greater picture, until Lander is driven nearly mad by what she finds out about The Other Side.<br /><br />Sounds like a winner, right? Unfortunately, the answer to the opening question is, \\"A book with a great premise, but which is ultimately sunk by tedium, repetition, a flat ending, stereotypical characterizations, and a criminal lack of editing.\\"<br /><br />Seriously, someone should find Willis's editor and charge them with second degree murder--of a novel. The first two-thirds of the book is an ad nauseum repetition of events:<br />1. Dr. Lander gets info on a patient's NDE and puzzles over the meaning, while Dr. Wright drops names of brain chemicals.<br />2. Lander hangs out and watches a movie with buddy Vielle.<br />3. Lander pops in to check on a comatose patient.<br />4. Lander tries to convince Vielle to quit working in the ER.<br />5. Lander talks to a precocious (and oh-so-irritating) little girl with heart trouble.<br />6. Lander tries to avoid meeting undesirable people in the hallway or answering her page/phone.<br />7. One character or another yammers forever about something inconsequential.<br />8. Lander undergoes her own chemically-induced NDE and freaks out.<br />9. Repeat for several hundred pages.<br />Most novels in recent years are too long by twenty percent. This one pushes forty. I cannot tell you how much of a slog it is just to get to the interesting part of the book. Sad to say, even the interesting parts are disappointing. A major twist occurs in the last third, but at this point most people have lost the will to live and had an NDE of their own.<br /><br />And this is a great loss, frankly, since Willis has some good ideas here. But the glacial pace at which events occur and plot points transpire could only be rescued by a triumphant ending, which this book completely lacks. The final key to NDEs is so underwhelming, and the fate of Joanna so frayed, that many readers will feel robbed for having pushed past the first hundred pages. Life is too short to read bad books and \\"Passage\\" has to rank right up there with some of the most draining books ever committed to print.<br /><br />This is my first experience with Willis and I was disappointed by the shoddiness of this work, particularly in light of the number of awards she's won. Her reputation alone warrants an extra star here, butit's generous. Truth is, \\"Passage\\" is just barely passable.	2004-09-12
US	49110251	R1YQRBWY7KP5RN	0884199487	727288860	The Maker's Diet	Books	3	722	856	N	N	A good diet wrapped in contradictory advice and bad theology	God brought the Hebrews into a promised land flowing with milk and honey. Thankfully for them, Dr. Ornish and Dr. Atkins were not along for the ride or else the doctors would have argued against the health of the place. At least that's what Dr. Jordan Rubin, the author of \\"The Maker's Diet\\" believes. He claims in this latest chart-topping diet book that the Maker of Heaven and Earth was right all along.<br /><br />Rubin starts this book with the same inspiring story he used to begin his bestselling \\"Physician Heal Thyself,\\" his comeback from near death due to advanced Crohn's disease. In his latest, he details the diet that restored his health, one based on the Old Testament's dietary laws. While there's not enough space here to detail the specifics of eating kosher, the advice here boils down to avoiding eating \\"unclean\\" animals (e.g. - shrimp, pork, eels), buying organic, forsaking sugar, shunning processed foods, getting eight hours of sleep, developing a deeper spirituality, and doing \\"natural\\" exercises. Plus, eating a little dirt now and then helps, too.<br /><br />What bothers me about \\"The Maker's Diet\\" goes beyond its infomercial script and to its very premise. The book is published by Strang Communications, a charismatic Christian publisher, and it claims the Bible as its source. Rubin argues that God gave Man the right to eat vegetables until the time of Noah, adding the eating of animal flesh after the flood. The Mosaic Laws further refined what was considered clean and unclean eating. It is largely the diet of Moses' day that Rubin endorses as being God's perfect diet.<br /><br />But there is a convenient Scriptural omission: Mark 7:18-19, wherein Jesus Himself declares all foods clean. Later in Acts 10:9-15 Peter is told by God to kill and eat unclean animals. When he responds that he has never eaten anything unclean or \\"common,\\" God replies, \\"You must stop calling unclean what God has made clean.\\" Peter now understood that Jesus's finished work fulfilled the OT Law for all of us, rendering moot issues of what was clean and unclean. No longer were the Gentiles considered \\"unclean,\\" just as food was no longer classified as clean and unclean (as in the Mark passage.) To further this point, the Apostle Paul routinely denounced Jewish Christians who insisted that the Gentile converts follow the OT laws (including the dietary laws espoused by Dr. Rubin.) As Paul writes later in Galatians 5:18, \\"But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.\\" Resurrecting the Law carries its own problems. James 2:10 says, \\"For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.\\" Living by the Law instead of the Spirit, compels a person to obey the entire Law--a tall order that no one was able to accomplish, and one of the primary reasons why Jesus came. That a publisher like Strang overlooks the flawed theology in \\"The Maker's Diet\\" is simply inexcusable.<br /><br />Some of the concepts Rubin lauds as gospel truth are questionable. The author routinely talks about the excellent heath of primitive people, but the lifespans of those people are remarkably low, in truth. Compare the overall appearance of an average woman in her mid-forties in a Western country with her primitive counterpart and the latter appears far older and decrepit. The author notes the perfect dentition of primitive people, but anyone with a few copies of National Geographic lying around can open to a lot of really poor teeth in the very people Rubin lauds. The argument for eating only \\"clean\\" foods also fails factually. The Japanese, for instance, live longer than anyone and enjoy remarkably healthy lives, yet they eat large amounts of meat (especially seafood) classified by Dr. Rubin as \\"unclean.\\" Rubin also cites many older medical texts that support his claims, although some of the science in those texts has been disproven in other areas. Lastly, the author's own story relates his quest for health by noting he tried hundreds of different diets in an effort to erase his ill health before he settled on this one, supposedly God's very own. A different person might have responded positively to one of those other diets, as millions of others have, considering the testimonials we get in the cornucopia of diet books out there. If Rubin had gotten results from eating a Tibetan monk's diet, we'd probably be getting a completely different title for the book.<br /><br />Inconsistencies in the advice abound, as well. Rubin says that exercise should not consist of unnatural exercises (e.g. - running, jogging) that elevate the heart rate for long periods. In other words, aerobics are out, while yardwork is in.

Randy Frazee's \\"The Connecting Church\\" is a book not unlike a coin; it has two sides--hope and frustration. Reading it will find you both wistful and pounding the table. Unfortunately, you end the book doing the latter.<br /><br />Frazee is one of a cadre of author/pastors spearheading a self-proclaimed renaissance within Christianity. Often called \\"postmodern Christianity\\" or \\"The Emerging Church,\\" this trend seeks to recover the spirit of the early New Testament Church. \\"The Connecting Church\\" embodies one of the most prominent aspects of Emerging theology: recovering deep human relationships via a \\"satellite house/neighborhood church\\" model.<br /><br />Tested within his own church in TX, the ideas espoused by the author take small groups to the extreme. Instead of traveling by car to a small affinity group of ten or so, the small group is your entire neighborhood. You reach your neighborhood by incorporating the people in it into your group through strong relationships and friendship evangelism. In a variation, a set of Christians moves together into a neighborhood and pursues the same ends.<br /><br />The part that few people will object to is living out a Mayberry-like ideal of community. You open your homes and lives to your group. You socialize with your group daily, almost to the exclusion of other relationships, pouring yourself relationally into a set of people that will stay together for years. Its an accumulation of social capital now sorely lacking in most people's lives.<br /><br />The larger church body itself works to enact a consistent discipleship program that supports the neighborhood groups. It has a distinct preaching cycle that repeats yearly. This program has measurable checkoffs for spiritual growth, meaning the church can see how effective it is in this area. The teachings aim to release people from a prison of consumerism, careerism, and isolation into a balanced love of God and love for others. In its purest form, this model moves into a semi-communal living mode that can even include shared possessions.<br /><br />A superficial reading of this book yields an immediate desire to make it work. I know that I would love to try to make such a community possible. But problems exist. As much as Frazee insists that people stay in one place, the nature of work today means that a family moves nearly every seven years, usually as a result of work situations. With the last recession forcing many families to move just to put food on the table, unless the Church in America is willing to work harder to help Christians keep their jobs, the dream of staying in one place is elusive. Truth is, the small rural communities revered in \\"The Connecting Church\\" are progressively becoming ghost towns because the jobs went elsewhere.<br /><br />There are other issues with idealizing small, tightknit, rural communities; in the book, the very model Frazee encourages cannot be applied to small, rural communities at all! It's inherently a suburban or city-only model. It's odd that Frazee cannot provide a workable modern solution for the very type of community he idolizes. I live in the country, and as much as I'd like to implement Frazee's model here, the basic elements of it do not play well in the countryside.<br /><br />Lastly, the emphasis on keeping neighbors together creates an unintentional ghetto-ization of the Church. If the residents of a rich neighborhood are encouraged to stay together exclusively, as is the poorer neighborhood, when will they mix? They used to mix on Sundays at the church, but Frazee encourages hanging with your group even at the whole church meetings. And as much as the goal is to create multigenerational, multicultural communities, most neighborhoods are remarkably homogeneous.<br /><br />In the end, the proof of concept is in the doing. Churches in my area that have adopted the model in \\"The Connecting Church\\" have been disappointed in the results, many abandoning it altogether. People are quite set in their ways, and the old small group model that is based mostly on affinity is not that creaky, yet. Like the Israelites who had to entirely die off before their descendants finally entered the promised land, this generation of Christians may some day pass on and allow Frazee's model to assume prominence in an upcoming generation that fully embraces it.<br /><br />\\"The Connecting Church\\" is filled with great ideas and will definitely get you thinking. Hopefully, Frazee will work out the bugs and find an audience willing to give it a try.stly on affinity is not that creaky, yet.

Better known for his gritty mystery novels featuring Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington played Rawlins in the film incarnation of &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;), Mosley goes in a different direction with &quot;The Man in My Basement.&quot;<br /><br /> Charles Blakey spends most of day haunting his ancestral home in Sag Hampton, lost in classic sci-fi books and his own libido. Cash is hard to come by, Blakey having pilfered from the cash drawer in his stint as a bank teller. Now blacklisted from all employers in town, he's reduced to cashing in bottles to keep from starving.<br /><br /> Into his life storms the small but intense Aniston Bennett, a filthy rich Greenwich-dweller intent on living in Blakey's basement--an unfinished one crawling with spiders and the leftovers of the Africa-born Blakeys that have gone before Charles. His reasons for doing this are lost on Blakey, who is overcome with a massive case of the creeps at the unannounced appearance of the Bennett on his doorstep. Unable to fathom the request to use his basement, Blakey declines, despite the lure of money.<br /><br /> But starvation has a way of changing a man's mind; Blakey later relents, soon to regret the decision when a jail cell arrives at his home ready to be installed in the basement and set for its future occupant. Bennett is imprisoned in the cell and the psy-war begins as the details of each man's life leach out, the black Blakey playing the prescribed role of interrogator and the white Bennett the willing man under the hot lights.<br /><br /> Mosley certainly sets up a bizarre tableau; it is hard to put the book down once we get to this point. Yet as the last page of &quot;The Man in My Basement&quot; plays out, we readers are left with nothing more than a contrivance that sets up indifferent questions that are resolved with a semi-happy ending that itself seems a contrivance.<br /><br /> Credit Mosley with trying to tackle the issue of evil in its many forms and how that evil creates its own good. We get long dialogues on the state of America, the power of money, and the insatiability of humanity. We look into the heart of darkness and what it does to mankind, but what is starkly missing from this novel is a moral center. There are no sympathetic characters and no hints of any standards of morality that might give us answers to the profound issues Mosley raises. In the end, the moral of &quot;The Man in My Basement&quot; is that no morals are possible; whatever gets you through the night, it's all right.<br /><br /> Great novels, the true classics of the lit world, leave us with stunning answers, or in lieu of this, truly great questions that change us. &quot;The Man in My Basement,&quot; unfortunately, gives us neither. It just is--an unfortunately common trend in fiction today. (If someone wishes to read a book that examines similar issues of purpose and life, I would recommend Thornton Wilder's &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey,&quot; instead.) Mosley is a gifted writer, but this simply is not his best work.Credit Mosley with trying to tackle the issue of evil in its many forms and how that evil creates its own good.

It contains a plan for disengaging from that spinning wheel and re-engaging with real people, family, friends, and neighbors, while also allowing us to sleep, think, and be all God intended for us to be.<br /><br /> Randy Frazee, a Texas pastor, postulates the idea of recovering the Hebrew idea of what constitutes a day. God, Frazee notes, instituted such a day and blessed it. From 6 AM to 6 PM is set aside for work, be it your job, your hobbies, meal prep, homework, and the like. After 6 PM the next four to five hours are solely devoted to relationships. No one works; they only relate. This becomes the new family lifestyle. Anything that interferes with this must be rethought and reworked to fit into the lifestyle.<br /><br /> That's the book in a nutshell.<br /><br /> Beyond the main theory, &quot;Making Room for Life&quot; covers the fundamentals of how to make this happen. The author notes how too much time is spent in the car and has us consider a lifestyle spent less in the minivan and more in the local neighborhood. He also advocates moving closer to work to cut down on commute times, freeing us up for better things. The issue of organized children's sports is also discussed, noting that families just a few years ago never used to plan all their kids sporting events; most kids play spontaneously and can even get good at sports without partaking in three different sports leagues a weekend.<br /><br /> Our work situations are also discussed. Frazee notes that most people only work well for about four hours a day before filling time or zoning out. Why work a twelve hour day then? Eight is good enough if you let the boss know this when you are hired.<br /><br /> And what to do with all this relational time? Why not start reaching out to neighbors? You could make your house the social hub of the neighborhood, develop deeper relationships with neighbors, and potentially even lead people to Christ through friendship evangelism. Small group Bible studies can come out of this, too, if we think outside the &quot;go to church&quot; model and rather &quot;be the Church.&quot;<br /><br /> Personally, I believe that what Frazee is saying makes sense. His ideas are sound and have wisdom. This is not to say that the book is perfect. Unfortunately, it has a few profound flaws.<br /><br /> The first issue concerns Frazee's ideal neighborhood--urban or suburban. All his ideas are clearly wrapped up in these two. But what about rural communities? It's as if they do not exist in this book. Nor do many of Frazee's ideas work at all for rural communities, oddly enough. Consider that the basis for his theory, &quot;Hebrew Time,&quot; was largely constructed for a rural Jewish (and later, Christian) people who did not live in the suburbs and were often spread out over an area that made the kind of community he advocates difficult to create. I live in such an area now and was constantly searching for references for how rural dwellers can make Frazee's ideas work--with absolutely no success.<br /><br /> The second, and larger, issue is that in his role as a pastor of a church, Frazee is radically out of touch with the modern business environment. At one point he insists that it is simply not true that employers look down on employees who work a mere eight hours when the rest of the crew is putting in eleven. This is a fine ideal to have, but reality shows that the eight hour guy is usually the first downsized. Many of the assertions Frazee makes about the way businesses operates are naive at best and dishonest at worst. Frazee admits that he's been a pastor all his life, so this does not help his cause here. He also possesses a number of high level degrees, which makes me ask how he got them if he was working within his Hebrew Time timeframe. The secular world does not operate on Hebrew Time.<br /><br /> That second issue is a breaker formost people, sadly, unless they can find a line of work that would operate within Hebrew Time. More power to them if they can! But for those of us with decades in a single industry, it's staggeringly hard to make the kind of break the author suggests, since the secular business world has its own set of rules.<br /><br /> This is why I rate this book merely fair. Too many people cannot implement these ideas due to work restraints. In a perfect world, it would be grand, but not everyone can line up all the ducks to make it happen. This is not to say it is impossible, but the Church needs to rethink its views on the business world and start interacting with it in new and radical ways that free up Christian employees if we are to make a go of the fine ideas found in &quot;Making Room for Life.&quot;ould operate within Hebrew Time.

Luis Alfredo Garcia-Roza's Brazilian police detective, Inspector Espinosa, is more likely to haunt a bookstore than to haunt the shadows and alleyways of Rio. He's no winner with the ladies and his fellow cops ignore him. And given that he believes an obvious suicide is murder (passing on routine forensics), he's also as sharp as a sack of ratos molhados.<br /><br /> The &quot;Silence of the Rain&quot; was a huge hit when it came out in Brazil. And why not? The author is well known in his native land and he populates his novel with all the classic detective elements: Sex, death, fear, and the mystery of a businessman shot in the head, the tortured body of the businessman's secretary's mother, the missing secretary, and a lowlife who happened to stumble into a money deal bigger than he realized. There's the deceased's sensuous wife, her potential suitor, the suitor's aerobic instructor girlfriend, and the dead man's business partner--all tangled up and knotty to sort out. None of it makes any sense to Espinosa.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, none of it makes much sense to us readers, either. This is an oddly written mystery novel. It starts and ends with an omniscient narrator, but in the middle it switches to Espinosa's first person point of view. Switching POV is necessary here since Garcia-Roza gives us almost no character detail for his protagonist in the first part of the book. This leaves readers with no one to care about--a major error. Switching back to omniscient later seems like an out, as if the author could not fill in the rest of the story through Espinosa's eyes.<br /><br /> Even given the POV issues, the story starts promisingly with a detailed look at the suicide of the businessman, so we know--a la &quot;Columbo&quot;--what Espinosa does not. Fair enough. Yet these elements only work well if the ultimate villain in the story is not telegraphed. Here, Garcia-Roza shows his hand so blatantly that the only suspense left is how the villain is dispatched. And I'll go on record as saying that the demise is as laughable as it is sorry. There is nothing worse than a writer bailing on the ending, except perhaps switching the POV, throwing the villain in our laps, and THEN bailing on the ending.<br /><br /> Considering the acclaim for &quot;The Silence of the Rain,&quot; the first in the Espinosa series to reach our shores, I had high hopes.

Obviously, Jones is one of those once-in-a-lifetime character creations, but given this, just how good is Fielding's latest heroine and story?<br />The truth is...not that good.<br />Olivia Joules (the surname a reference to a measure of energy) is a slightly off-kilter journalist that skims dangerously close to hack territory. Her name a desperate attempt to leave behind a tragic childhood, she flits from exotica locale to exotic locale following the whims of fashionistas, supermodels, and celebrities. Yet despite her gauzy occupation,she has a set of life rules she follows religiously, and always keeps a hatpin handy to dispatch would-be Lotharios who cross the line.<br />In covering a new fragrance release in Miami, she stumbles across a movie producer who bears an uncanny resemblance to Osama bin Laden. Always on the lookout for a way into the journalistic big leagues, she insinuates herself into his presence and begins what will ultimately be a descent into hell-albeit with lots of sunscreen and superb diving.<br />When a major new cruise ship is sent to Davy Jones's locker, Olivia puts two and two together and winds up following the suspected terror king all over the globe, each stop putting her closer to being bedded by the Bedouin. Will she pull it off with the aplomb that has become her signature style? Or will she be just so much chum in the emerald waters?<br />Having not read any of Fielding's previous works, I can say that after a while the reader may not care if Olivia Joules makes it out alive or not. The problem with this book is two-fold. It is very stagy, the scenes plotted out as if the movie deal is already inked. Miami, LA, Mexico, Honduras, London, Sudan-it's a travelogue held together by a wisp of story. And that story is dragged out for far too long as the backdrops whisk by one after another. Fielding may be trying to spoof 007 movies, but she doesn't do it that well. Every character seems out of place, particular when they coincidently show up in every locale Joules visits.<br />The second problem is with the male characters; they are all poorly written caricatures. Joules's newspaper editor seems to be an Anglicanized version of The Daily Planet's Perry White, a phone jammed in his ear and throbbing veins ready to burst from his forehead. The male lead, Pierre Feramo, the suspected terrorist, is so oddly portrayed that he has no center at all. Every time he does anything in the book, it is unrealistic. It is almost as if Fielding had no idea how to make the character consistently human, and male. The true love interest, and I'll leave that one a secret, is just a fool, plain and simple-a man Olivia can always one-up. This may be an empowering female character to some women, but did Fielding have to write her at a cost to everyone male around her?<br />This is not to say the book has no redeeming value-it's a quintessential summer beach book--but it is still disappointing. Fielding leads up to a final showdown that fizzles, only to have an epilogue that is the real finale-and it fizzles, too. Pieces of greatness are here, but with no supporting structure it sags under a reading malaise. That's too bad from an author who was able to give us a lot more in her previous books.<br />Despite all the promise and a spot on the bestseller lists, this one is merely fair.ops whisk by one after another.

With so many children's books hitting the market every year, it takes a superior sense of fun to stand out. Frank Asch's hysterically bizarre \\"Monsieur Saguette and His Baguette\\" has the wit to do just that.<br />The title character, a simple Frenchman with a predilection for soup and bread, visits his local boulangerie in search of his favorite staple. Baguette in hand, he then sets off on a series of rescues, saving the day with his all-purpose baked good. When France is crawling with crocodilians ready to consume infants, trust Mr. Saguette to find a way to wedge the gator's jaws open with his trusty lunch. Robbers stand no chance against his loaf; marching bands (France is loaded with them, right?) can only march thanks to this man's love for bread. Like \\"The Simpsons\\" inanimate carbon rod, Mr. Saguette's baguette continually saves the day. It's about as daffy as daffy gets.<br />Everyone we've shared this book with has laughed at its wackiness. My wife wonders why Mr. Saguette would want to eat his baguette after a gator's slobbered all over it, but who's enforcing logic on this food-obsessed Frenchman?<br />There's nothing not to like here, from the simple illustrations to the witty story. Author Asch has created a clever character who is both whimsical and  sincere. I hope for all of us that we get more of this Gallic gourmand.<br />Highly recommended for young children...and their parents, too.	2004-06-15

Fiction has become a yawning chasm filled with raving blurbs, but empty promises. Such is the case in yet another promising, but ultimately throwaway, book &quot;The Boy on the Bus.&quot;<br />It is one thing for a writer to have an interesting idea. It is quite another to write a book with characters the reader can care about or that possesses an ending that does justice to the author's writing skill.<br />What we get in &quot;The Boy on the Bus&quot; is the tale of Vermont housewife Meg, now in her thirteenth year of postpartum depression. Her pseudo-husband is an aloof architect who has chosen to entomb himself across the border in Canada, his erstwhile building project forcing him to be conveniently away. Their daughter Katie had enough of this arrangement and begged off for boarding school.<br />That leaves Charlie, the feeble, asthmatic son, who one school bus ride later comes home to a mother who does not recognize him as hers. He's some new, improved doppelganger who appears to have shed his asthma and paleness, leaving Meg with no ability to rescue him like she has always done. Her shock at seeing this boy who has replaced her son serves as the basis of the story, a tale that verges on the Twilight Zone.<br />If only it were that good. But author Deborah Schupack has created a world where not a single sympathetic character exists. In fact, you want to shake everyone in this book and tell them to snap out of it. I found myself just detesting the characters, hoping that at least the narrative would take me to some curious place that proved satisfying.<br />This, too, was too much to ask. The novel ends with no answers, no character development, nothing for the reader to hold onto. The wispy concept of parents watching their children grow faster than can be mentally absorbed holds a modicum of interest, but is so paper-thin as to bring no satisfaction to the reader.<br />And this is a shame because Schupack is a good writer. Some of her images are startling (though others seem a bit forced), but she can keep the reader involved. Her double meanings and confused imagery that later resolves to be less than imagined are well done. But with such disagreeable characters we care nothing about, a plot that ends with a whimper, and a message that could have been delivered in so many more thought-provoking ways, there is nothing to be learned here.

It captures the craft better than any ten other writing books and does so in a manner that other books do not: it gets to the point.<br />No review can capture the essence of the book perfectly because the author is so multitalented. As an editor, author, publisher, and book doctor, Stein brings a wealth of wisdom. His greatest skill, though, is cutting through the drivel other books peddle by telling writers what really will take their work to the next level. For instance, his chapter on pacing techniques is unique to all the writing books I've encountered. If you want to know how to cut the flab from your work, Stein gives the best advice you'll find. His recommendations on particularity are especially helpful, and just another of the essential writing tools that others gloss over. Few writing books discuss the importance of choosing an appropriate title for one's work, and again, Stein gives stellar advice. Chapter after chapter is filled with sage solutions to every writer's problems.<br />The best thing about \\"Stein on Writing\\" is that the advice is timeless. Stein himself shows how his answers aren't new, but go back to Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, and Melville.

O'Conner's grammar book &quot;Woe Is I,&quot; I was looking forward to reading what she has to say about the craft of writing. What I found was underwhelming.<br />&quot;Words Fail Me&quot; is the author's atempt to distill many years of writing in the newspaper realms into a manageable book for would-be writers. Her wit, charm, and way around a pun makes this smooth, fun reading. Tackling issues like writer's block, grammar, writing humor, smoothing out word order in sentences, and more, O'Conner gives us a handy book that nails all the basics.<br />But therein lies the problem: the book is too basic. There are dozens of books on the market that mine this same territory, a few better, most worse. While &quot;Words Fail Me&quot; is well-written and informative, it simply does not go into the level of detail that will help writers rise above the mundane. Nor does the author dish the dirt that writers need to know to get their work published. It would seem to me with her outstanding experience that O'Conner would do a better job with the &quot;deep knowledge&quot; she possesses about publishing as an industry. While this may be another book that she has in her, any book like &quot;Words Fail Me&quot; has to do a better job of helping writers distinguish themselves from the vast pool of writing talent. Millions are writers, but how do you take the craft to the level needed to stand out from the crowd? You won't be any closer to grasping this after reading this book. And that's too bad.<br />If you can write a decent sentence, you won't need &quot;Words Fail Me.&quot; Sol Stein's &quot;Stein on Writing&quot;  is an excellent next step instead, that author providing the inside knowledge sadly missing from O'Conner's book. The only thing unique about &quot;Words Fail Me&quot; is the fact that it may be the only book of its kind ever written that includes a lone appendix containing a joke about a duck in a hardware store. Other than that, it's just not in-depth enough to justify it as a must-read.t not in-depth enough to justify it as a must-read.	2004-05-19

Auster signed a multi-book deal and had one due.<br />2. Auster had two stories (neither with an ending) too short to be published as a single book.<br />3. Auster wanted to see if he could pass anything off as literature.<br />Whatever the reason, this book is what happens when good writers go bad.<br />Auster's man character in this book, writer Sidney Orr, went bad once already. He  is recovering from a mystery illness that nearly left him pushing up daisies. Away from his pen for a year, he ventures down to The Olde Curiousity Shoppe...excuse me, The Paper Palace, owned by the stereotypically inscrutable Mr. M.R. Chang, and picks up a mysterious, blue notebook made in Portugal (don't question the location--you won't find an answer.) This curious notebook subsequently allows our hero to break through his writers block.<br />The gripping tale that flows out of Sidney's rediscovered chops is the story of a man who must reexamine his life after a near-smooshing by a wayward concrete gargoyle that flies its roost from a building he's walking under. This character decides to abandon his wife and randomly catch a flight to Kansas City. Eventually moneyless, he hooks up with the taxi driver who picked him up and finds himself overseeing a bizarre, underground museum of phone books the taxi driver has tended unseen for years. Even worse for this escapee from his own life, he winds up trapped in a bomb shelter inside the museum with no one to rescue him.<br />Now this is an interesting story so far, but at this point Auster completely folds and abandons the whole story-within-the-story, introducing a pivotal new character into Sidney's life and a whole 'nother plotline. But this abandonment of the tale unfolding in his mystery notebook and the switch into a new series of events in his life--a highly improbable set that is unfortunately devoid of interest--leads to one of the most unsatisfying endings of any book I've ever read.<br />Meant to be a meditation on synchronicity, \\"Oracle Night\\" instead becomes the mere musings of a talented author who didn't have anything new to say. It's so inconsequential in its moral, the entire book could have been the word \\"whoa\\" and it would have had more to say about the human condition than what Auster wrote. The supposed \\"deep\\" message can only be deemed so by junior high English students. Remedial junior high English students.<br />The current condition of fiction today is desperate. A random pick of any recent novel will more often than not yield page bloat, lightweight characterizations, morally bankrupt morals, pointless plotlines, and a flat finale. Paul Auster becomes yet another decent author to phone one in to his editor.<br />I don't give out five-star and one-star ratings lightly, but \\"Oracle Night\\" is so utterly devoid of any reason for existing that I've got to go with the lone star or face many sleepless nights because of guilt for leading others astray. Skip this one entirely and thank me later.st unsatisfying endings of any book I've ever read. <br />Meant to be a meditation on synchronicity, \\"Oracle Night\\" instead becomes the mere musings of a talented author who didn't have anything new to say.

But is he able to pull off the trifecta with his third in the series, \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\"?<br />Not many authors are able to boast a wholly original idea and create a unique world out of it; Fforde has. Readers follow his heroine Thursday Next not only in her books, but into books themselves.  In \\"WOLP,\\" we find her pregnant and hiding away from the Microsoft-like Goliath Corporation, a monolithic, &uuml;ber-corporation none too happy with how she foiled their latest attempt at world domination in the previous book, \\"Lost in a Good Book.\\" With the ability to actually jump into the storyline of a novel, Thursday has stolen into an unpublished, hackneyed, detective potboiler. There she expects to have her baby in peace, even as she fights to remember the husband the Goliath Corporation erased from the timestream.<br />But all is not well in the Well of Lost Plots inside the Great Library, the repository of all books ever written. Her hideout book is threatened with being dismantled and sold for scrap ideas. As she tries to become a Jurisfiction agent (charged with keeping storylines pure), she watches her future colleagues--themselves characters from various novels (including \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\")--killed off one by one. And to top it all off, her memories are being erased by supervillain Aornis Hades, the Minotaur goes on a rampage, and the upcoming upgrade to UltraWord (a new way of improving the book-reading experience) may instead destroy the book world. Toss in two housemates struggling with going from generic characters to fully realized, starring roles in their own novel, and Thursday finds her peaceful escape coming apart at the binding.<br />For fans of the Next novels (\\"The Eyre Affair\\" is the first in the series), coming back to Thursday's adventures is a breath of fresh air in a formulaic marketplace. And yes, another book will come after \\"WOLP.\\" But this third book has some problems that make it less enjoyable than the previous two--problems that will hopefully be rectified by the fourth novel.<br />Like so many novels today, it is too long by almost twenty percent, yet the battle against Aornis Hades ends abruptly and with few details. But perhaps most hurtful of all, Fforde's clever world within books has become overrun with too many characters. This makes it hard to keep track of who's who. And the author's attempts to further develop his world leaves readers with almost TOO much detail. Like many books that do this, the flow of reading is interrupted while the reader scurries back to previous novels in the series or to an earlier chapter to doublecheck info. Lastly, \\"WOLP\\" takes far too long developing its complex storyline. A third of the way in and virtually nothing has happened. This makes \\"WOLP\\" more tedious reading than the earlier books.<br />Jasper Fforde has conjured up an enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy series that takes us into the world of books like no other before it. Its wacky vision makes it noteworthy. But let's hope that in the next Next book will have more story, better writing, and a whole lot less of everything else or else readers are going to need a shelf of reference books dedicated to the series in order to follow it.air in a formulaic marketplace.

It's a jumble of information that consists of old publishing war stories, advice to book buyers, writing tips, and a large bit of self-promotion (not for new writers, but Sol Stein himself.) A publisher, editor and book doctor, Stein has plenty of insights and comes off as a grandfatherly mentor . Despite this admirable curriculum vitae, a reader's assessment of the value of all this is truly up in the air.<br />Written in an almost biographical fashion, this guide is best when Stein cuts to the chase of what works and what doesn't. His advice on tightening wording and the logical flow of action are very helpful. The section on realistic dialogue is perfect. The discussion of how to best position the \\"engine\\" that will drive your novel is also well done. There are several helpful bits here; best of all, the cream of his advice is summarized in one chapter.<br />But this book is troublesome on many accounts. Stein is an old-timer, and as much as he despises today's formulaic fiction, that unfortunately is what is selling--whether he (or a prospective bestselling author) likes it or not. It is one thing to write well, but quite another to aspire to the literary heights of Fitzgerald, Faulkner, and Hemingway and then suffer for it. He also has a penchant to refer to his client's works. The issue with this is that most of us have not read those works and they are significantly older, written in a manner not in keeping (again) with what is selling. Lastly, the iconoclastic Stein believes that quality trumps everything, including potential sales. He gives plenty of examples of how he turned low-selling, but exceptional, works into bestsellers. But today's editors are not being given that luxury to nurse books along and spend a fortune to promote them. All this only creates hope where little exists in today's market.<br />So \\"How to Grow a Novel\\" is a mixed bag. Because of its layout it is hard to use as a reference--lots of cherrypicking is required. The advice is sometimes spot-on, sometimes archaic. The reminiscing is nice in a biography, but ho-hum here. And with the constant references to Stein's older writing book, \\"Stein on Writing,\\" it's probably just a better idea to read that one and pass on the merely fair \\"How to Grow a Novel.\\"e as a reference--lots of cherrypicking is required. The advice is sometimes spot-on, sometimes archaic. The reminiscing is nice in a biography, but ho-hum here.

It occupies a niche in the chess book market by virtue of its quiz style of learning. For beginners (and those wanting a simple refresher course), it's a very good addition to your chess library.<br />The format of the book consists of a series of brief chapter intros to a particular aspect of chess playing, each chapter followed by a set of small quizzes that reinforce the intro. The quiz layouts are nicely done in that you take a look at a position on a chessboard, answer the question below it, and then turn to the top of the next page to find the answer. It's quick and easy. When you reach the end of the book, you simply turn it over and keep going. Each set of quizzes adds on to previously gained knowledge, so by the end of the book, you are presented with fairly difficult positions to analyze.<br />No chess book is perfect. You are not going to learn about openings or defenses. The mid-game is not discussed. No grandmaster analysis is provided. Fischer's insights are not very deep.<br />What the book does well is assist people in seeing the whole board. It's also good in helping understand massing of power. And while some might criticize its dependency on endgame offensive scenarios, anyone who has been a beginning player knows how hard it is sometimes to deliver the kill.<br />This is an inexpensive book that can be read in spurts. It is certainly not the last word on chess, but it will help people new to the game tremendously. For kids who can read, this is a fine resource for learning the game. No matter what your age, though, if you are new to chess consider this a must-have.	2004-04-08

Wrapped in a veneer of business skullduggery, this thriller will keep you turning pages and nodding in recognition whenever another tech clich&eacute; glides into view.<br />Adam Cassidy is your typical slacker programmer filling days in a cubicle and nights in a bar. Bored to tears, he tries to pull one over on the boss by rerouting some cash in order to give an overlooked fellow employee a proper retirement sendoff. Typical of most postmoderns, his relativistic views on proper employee decorum (as well as good and evil, in general) land him in deep doo-doo. Threatened with a lifetime of rotting in a federal pen for fooling around with company funds, he sells his shriveled soul to become a corporate spy for &uuml;ber-CEO Nick Wyatt (an extremely thinly-veiled Larry Ellison of Oracle fame.)<br />Cassidy is tasked with cracking rival company Trion Systems' new project, entitled AURORA. He's coached in being a rising tech star and given all manner of insider info by Wyatt and his cronies. Soon, he's hired on at the competitor. And not only does he spy with abandon, his fearless take on business soon finds him as the right-hand man for everyman CEO of Trion, Jock Goddard (a typical killer app designer who parlayed it all into running a big telecom firm on cornpone and nice feelings, the quintessential anti-Wyatt.)<br />Now in the top tier, Cassidy starts unraveling the mystery behind AURORA, bedding a key AURORA project manager, and along the way becoming the surrogate son of Trion's founder.  But on his journey, he develops a fatal flaw: he begins to love the kinder, gentler atmosphere of the very company he is betraying to the soul-challenged Nick Wyatt.<br />The tension comes in this book through numerous close scrapes at being exposed, the big AURORA question, the puzzle of cracking security at Trion, and Cassidy's unwitting discovery of disloyalty in the upper echelons of Trion's management. All the while, Wyatt steams in the background, demanding more and more risky spying.<br />If you've spotted the inevitable double and triplecrosses ten miles down the road, you wouldn't be alone. \\"Paranoia\\" is a textbook case of writing a book to formula.

O'Conner's \\"Woe Is I\\" is your best medicine.<br />Writing in a pun-filled style that uses sentence examples ripped right out of such pop culture staples as \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"The Honeymooners\\", O'Conner covers everything from punctuation perfidy to vexing vocabulary.  Best of all, once she tells you the correct usage, she lets you know that rules truly are made to be broken, giving us the scoop on just how (and when) to break them--while still maintaining some sense of grammatical decorum.<br />If the mere thought of cracking open \\"The Chicago Manual of Style\\" causes palpitations, then you'll reach for this one knowing that the author does a wonderful job of simply getting to the point.

His Asian worldview informs his Christianity in such a way that he brings a completely different understanding that is refreshing to Western readers able to follow what he writes.<br />In &quot;Sit, Walk, Stand,&quot; Nee tackles the book of Ephesians discussing the Christian's placement in Christ. First, he notes how a Christian must start his journey with Christ by sitting--resting alongside the Savior who has done all the work. And because Christ has done all the work, the Christian is given the peace of knowing there is nothing he or she can add. Walking comes from being seated as the Christian merely lives out the Christian life by claiming his place seated alongside Christ. Our ministry comes via the finished work. And lastly, in standing, the Christian holds the territory Christ has taken from Satan by calling on the name of Jesus and living out Christ's triumph.<br />As with all Nee works, the outright simplicity and wisdom of his writing cuts to the soul and spirit. For those who struggle in their Christian journey, the author's words come as a joyful balm since he shows how we can stop trying to do it all by ourselves and let Christ rule.<br />With so much packed into such a short book, this is a fantastic resource for anyone who wants to find peace in Christ while living out a more vital existence. A must read and truly worthy of five stars.	2004-03-16

Even more than twenty years after his death, people are still being touched by his music and message. I know that I am a different person because of my exposure to this bold man of God.<br />\\"No Compromise: The Life Story of Keith Green\\" follows Keith from failed teen idol  to the tops of the Christian music carts to a fiery plane crash in Texas. We see his early days as a struggling musician whose life was one of constant seeking but never finding until the day that Jesus put an end to the search. Along the way, Melody Green (with David Hazard) paints a picture of the early Jesus Movement of the late Sixties and early Seventies, showing how she and Keith were in the midst of it. Anyone who has been a Christian for a long time will be fascinated by how God put the Greens into the right places at the right time. There is a look at the nascent days of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship; friendships with classic Christian musicians like Randy Stonehill, Larry Norman, Barry McGuire, and Phil Keaggy; radical days of ministry highlighted by long nights ministering to anyone who would listen; and a sense of destiny shared by a small group of people with a common vision. It is almost a textbook-worthy look at a post-hippie Christianity finding its way.<br />To say that Keith Green is revered in certain circles is an understatement. One of the nicest features of this book is that it demythologizes the man himself. The \\"shoot first and ask questions later\\" perspective of Keith that made so many consider him a prophet is examined more closely, revealing feet of clay that some might find surprising. Often the hard-hitting songs that we have taken for granted were written as much for Keith himself to hear as for anyone else, the stinging messages a form of self-discipline for the author as much as his audience. Yet even in the correction of bad eating habits and too much TV, we are shown a prophet who examined his own life and often found it wanting. Finally, we get to see how Keith's self-defining brashness often backfired and how he came to a more gentle place in his ministry shortly before his death.<br />All these revelations are helpful in understanding the man behind the myth. Still, there are lapses. Very little is said about the recording sessions that led to the amazing albums. They come and go and we learn little. Certain anecdotes don't seem to lead anywhere, either, leaving the reader to merely surmise how or why Keith came to a certain place in his thoughts, actions, and spiritual development. Short excerpts from his journals are included, but more would still have been better. I know that I wanted to probe further into the subtle changes in the spiritual life of the man that led him into the situations outlined here, especially in the last year of his life--a year that zips by in the book. I suppose a wife can only know so much, and for those of us who want to know exactly how everything fell into place, I can only say that this book serves to drive us closer to God in order to ask Him those unanswered questions for our own ministries.<br />That said, this is still a very good biography of a man that practically packed a whole lifetime of spiritual growth into twenty-eight all too short years.

US	49110251	RNCMIYOL4RUP3	093500825X	981010965	The Latent Power of the Soul	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Not Nee's best book	\\"The Latent Power of the Soul\\" is an unusual book that bears all the hallmarks of Watchman Nee's extraordinary wisdom, but on a topic not normally addressed in his writings: psychology and parapsychology. Unfortunately, while he does an admirable job of analyzing the former, he stumbles on the latter.<br />Nee postulates that when Adam fell, not only did his remarkable physical body suffer, but also his superior soul. Now trapped in his flesh, Adam's soul became not a force for good, but for corruption. From this corrupted soul comes a force that can be tapped to take on aspects of \\"soul power\\" that can result in unusual manifestations usually associated with yogis, clairvoyants, and shamans. This paranormal manifestation of soul power is not of God and conflicts with the spiritual power given by the Holy Spirit to believers. It is the source for false miracles and devilish phenomena that Nee believes will be behind the deception of the elect talked about in Revelation.<br />The author also discusses how this abusive power is enabled by modern psychiatric methods. Beyond this he also notes how this will to power is abused even by those in the Church. Preachers preach out of their own charisma rather than the Holy Spirit's, congregations suffer from a form of self-hypnosis that mimics real worship while not attaining to it, and even prayers can come from the soul rather than the spirit. None of this is of God; true believers will discern this and stay far away. Nee gives ample tips on how to distinguish the real from the fake.<br />Unlike some of Nee's other fine works, this book sadly has some holes. Nee's belief that people like Franz Mesmer, Uri Geller, and other pseudo-mystics tapped some unusual power is hopeful at best. Professional debunkers of psychics-- James Randi comes to mind--have shown that modern psychics are simply clever illusionists whose paranormal powers cannot stand up to scientific scrutiny. If there is a latent power of the soul, these frauds do not display the paranormal aspect of it. Concerning the demonic activity that takes on these qualities, Nee affirms it exists, but why try to attach it to man's fallen soul rather than seeing it as wholly its own manifestation?<br />In summary, Nee's Asian worldview influences this work as he stands apart from a Western interpretation of the tripartite nature of Man--especially the soul. As for the more normal aspects of tapping the power of the soul to win over people or to create the many will to power issues Nee examines in the book, the author has many salient points that can help believers understand when something comes from the emotional soul rather than the calm spirit.<br />Not his best work and sometimes quite esoteric, even for Nee.

Trina Hyman's lushly illustrated version of Grimm's tale of a young girl and her grandmother beset by a wickedly ravenous wolf is about as good as this tale gets. Fortunately for the reader, this Red Riding Hood avoids the politically correct fate of so many other modern versions of similar works.<br />Done with an Arts & Crafts flair, the illustrations are detailed and worthy of the Caldecott Honor award this book received. The text is relegated to a small box on every other page, giving plenty of space to enjoy the drawings.<br />I don't have the original Grimm text, so I cannot comment on how true to their text this work is. However, I can say that the wolf's snacking on Grandma and Red, plus his gruesome demise, is here in all its glory. Don't tell anyone from PETA.<br />If you are the kind of parent that loves classic tales wondrously retold, and doesn't want to sugarcoat life, then by all means get this one. It is lovely to look at and has a good moral base--just the way they used to make 'em.	2004-03-09

As man's best friend, dogs have had more than their share of books written about them. But in a world of throwaway pet guides comes \\"Caring for Your Dog,\\" an exceptionally complete and beautifully put together book that should be mandatory reading for anyone who loves dogs, or even those merely considering purchasing one.<br />A classic Dorling Kindersley book, this is a well-bound, finely constructed book with thick pages, clear text, truly helpful sidebars, excellent photography, and intuitive layout of the info. DVM Bruce Fogle writes authoritatively on all aspects of dog care, particularly diseases, with technically accuracy that will not overwhelm laymen. There are even carefully constructed flowcharts for helping in diagnosing illness and attempting first aid.<br />The sheer breadth of info included in the 448 pages of this book is staggering, but despite this, the book is still readable and interesting for its own sake (apart from merely being a reference.) The section on choosing a dog is helpful for those looking to start out, comparing numerous breeds for their trainability, noise, size and suitability for children. There are training tips, breeding advice, nutrition information, and much more. The largest section in the book, by far, covers diseases and treatment. While it is definitely clinical in its approach, this section is essential for maintaining your dog's health and is quite helpful in pointing out how humans and dogs differ in the diseases they get and how owners need to think along these lines when their pet is not itself. Again, for first-time buyers, there is extensive sidebar coverage of the susceptibility of certain breeds to disease and genetic problems in purebreds. (After reading this book, for instance, I wonder why any first-time dog owner would want a German Shepherd due to the extreme range of illnesses this breed suffers.) Lastly, its recent publishing date makes the treatment info current in a time when medications and treatments change quickly.<br />In summary, even though too many books get awarded five stars, this book truly deserves the rating. A must for any dog owner or anyone considering the purchase of a dog.

There are plenty of desperate people out there, but perhaps none are more desperate than writers seeking their first big hit.<br />With this in mind, a book like &quot;The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference&quot; comes along and hits average fan fiction writers right where they live. And that's a shame because plenty of writers out there will think a book like this will be helpful. Truth is, it is anything but.<br />The word &quot;Complete&quot; in the title is about as hopeful as hopeful can be. Consider this: the book ends with a single paragraph describing a trebuchet, a very important piece of medieval weaponry. One lowly paragraph. How would anyone writing fantasy in that time period get anything from one paragraph? Just 276 pages in a trade paperback size does not a complete reference make on even one of the many topics addressed here. I wrote a paper in college on medieval weaponry that put this book's section on that topic to shame. This is true for almost any topic. Werewolves? Half a page. The Incas? Two and a half pages. The Holy Roman Empire? Three quarters of a page. By trying to be all things, this book gives no writer any reference worth using.<br />This book is cobbled together from several sources, so its flow is stilted. Illustrations are sparse and not from a single illustrator, so there is no uniformity. The chapters are written by various authors and the topics covered include:<br />*Traditional Fantasy Cultures<br />*World Cultures<br />*Magic<br />*Witchcraft &amp; Pagan Paths<br />*Commerce, Trade, &amp; Law in Contemporary Fantasy<br />*Fantasy Races<br />*Creatures of Myth &amp; Legend<br />*Dress &amp; Costume<br />*Arms, Armor, &amp; Armies<br />*Anatomy of a Castle<br />Still, any writer worth his salt has to do far more research to make his world believable than what can be derived from this work. For that reason, what purpose does this book serve? None that I can see.<br />Writers Digest books publishes dozens of helpful books. This is simply not one of them.them.	2004-03-03

Or in the case of the mysterious and imaginative Evelyn Todd, is it actually even &quot;her&quot; at all?<br />Anthony O'Neill's sophomore effort centers on this unusual woman, who as a child in an Edinburgh orphanage let her mind soar beyond the gray walls. The repressive headmaster, however, was unable to keep his young charge sufficiently under his thumb, instead turning her over to &quot;parents&quot; she never knew. Young Evelyn then finds herself face to face with the once faceless lamplighter she would watch at night outside her window. At this point all Hell breaks loose.<br />A couple decades later, people start dying and bodies are exhumed. The assistant police chief, seeking glory apart from his superior, takes on the case and immediately finds himself stymied at every turn, even as he uses the events as a touchpoint for a true crime book he's writing. Meanwhile, an intrepid professor McKnight and his walking partner, Canavan, also partake in the skullduggery, attempting to find their own answers to the crimes.<br />Into this mix comes Evelyn, now an adult, though a highly confused one with a Jekyll/Hyde personality. Instantly, she becomes the focus of both investigations. But things take a strange twist when a supernatural beast appears to be committing the crimes--a beast that always leads back to this woman who suffered an arcane wound so long ago.<br />Having read &quot;The Dante Club,&quot; another book set in the latter half of the 19th Century and also featuring amateur sleuths of the academic kind on the trail of a hellish murderer, comparisons with this book are inevitable. Both also feature somewhat tortured dialog in keeping with the times, plenty of gore, brooding events, and spooky religious overtones. but O'Neill's book winds up on the short end of the stick.<br />The problems here are multiple. The conjoined storylines seem odd, then resolve to further the plot, only the reasoning is highly forced and ultimately unbelievable. O'Neill also writes as if he has a screenplay in mind. That this work resembles so many of the forgettable movies scripts that have play in the cineplexes for a couple weeks and then vanish makes it more of a product of our age than the Victorian. Worst of all, the author makes the classic mistake of not really understanding the nature of the religious topic he attempts to manipulate in his book. This leads to a highly unsatisfying conclusion for people who DO understand.<br />In the author's defense, his style and voice are very good, he paints his settings with enough detail to envision them well, and the story has a decent creepiness.

David Limbaugh's \\"Persecution\\" could better be titled \\"Double Standard\\" since the primary point made by the hundreds of citations showing persecution of Christians in America fall more into the category of \\"Anything but Christianity.\\"<br />This book is chock full of incidents in which Christians are purposefully discriminated against in the name of misguided secularism or blatant preferences for other thought systems. In that respect it does a decent job of showing the progressive distaste that our culture and our government have toward anything that smacks of evangelical or fundamentalist Christianity.<br />Though I am the kind of Christian that inspires the ire so well-addressed by this book, I have a couple complaints. First, Christians are not dying for the name of Christ in this country, so the level of what is called \\"persecution\\" is more like \\"relentless annoyance and thoughtless discrimination.\\" There is no doubt, though, that Christians in this country will face real persecution someday, as this book shows how the Christian voice is being actively silenced in all arenas of public life (which as we know from history is the first step to outright persecution.) Still, the title is a bit over-the-top.<br />My second complaint is in the weariness that comes from reading of one lawsuit after another brought by both Christian and secularist forces as detailed in the book. I have got to wonder if all the suing is really accomplishing anything more than making everyone a whole lot twitchier. I can almost imagine many of the middle management people in the situations cited caught between the two sides in one of those \\"damned if I do and damned if I don't\\" situations. I think that most people who make these \\"anti-Christian\\" decrees in schools, businesses, and such are stuck by all the legal wrangling and are just trying to avoid lawsuits in the first place, only to find themselves mired in them anyway. Limbaugh almost never cites examples that provide solutions without winding up in court somewhere. Nor does he offer any solutions as to how to avoid these legal battles and yet still find solutions to the issues.<br />The book ends with a penultimate chapter discussing the Christian roots of this country, providing one of the more controversial sections--at least from what perusing other reader comments here shows. Personally, I thought this section did a good job in dispelling the idea that America was founded as a wholly secular nation. The explanation of the intent of the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment (that was started in the first chapter of the book) finds its culmination in this chapter and can prove enlightening to those who have only heard the other side of the Founding Fathers' stories. Lastly, Limbaugh talks with some current Christian leaders who provide their insights on the issues.<br />Rating this book is almost impossible because of the very type of book it is: a populist examination of political and legal trends. It's not intended to be an academic examination, which is disappointing, nor is it meant to be a screed. It preaches to the choir and irritates anyone who scoffs at the whole premise. In short, it is almost unreviewable. The citations get repetitive after a while, which brings the rating down, but then the book rebounds when discussing political theory and how Christianity informs it. Final rating? Three stars, but could have been more for a more scholarly approach.t winding up in court somewhere.

Jeremy soon finds that the pirate life is for him--staying up till all hours, saying \\"Arr,\\" and foregoing vegetables. But after finding no one to tuck him in at night (in a hilarious pirate pile illustrated with great touches by David Shannon), Jeremy has second thoughts about a life on the seven seas. In the end, he gets the last laugh in a delicious little twist ending.<br />I will consistently go back to books like \\"How I Became a Pirate\\" for their gentle humor, wonderful illustrations, and pleasant reading that appeals to children. It's hard to go wrong with those qualities and you would go wrong if you passed up this delightful little book. I know my three year old son ate up every word and drawing in it.

Any writer looking for deep words from the large (and highly respected) group of writers featured in &quot;Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life&quot; will come away disappointed. But for those writers who are looking for a laugh and a breezy escape featuring personal writing tales from the likes of William F. Buckley, Ed McBain, Danielle Steel, Julia Child, Ray Bradbury and Elmore Leonard, this book fills the bill as well as anything out there.<br />A handsome book with a clean layout, quality semigloss stock, and a good binding, the showpieces are the delightful Charles Schultz &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips featuring Snoopy in his hopeless Writer persona. Each one is funnier than the next, and as brought together in one place provide an overview of Snoopy's writing strips that I have not found in any other collection. (The strips span the latter half of the comic's run as Snoopy's Writer didn't show up until the Seventies.)<br />Schultz skewers just about every genre of writing, nails the agonies and ecstasies of rejection and acceptance, and does more with &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot; than seems humanly possible. If you are a writer and can't laugh at Snoopy's pathetic talents, you need to get out of the profession! Nonwriters might find the author anecdotes just a distraction from the humor in the strips, but what a wonderful distraction.<br />So sure, it fails to be a writer's workshop, sacrificing technical knowhow  for mirth, but still, how can you lose? I can think of far worse ways for a writer to spend  a few hours than reading this little piece of escapism.<br />A three star book with a four star soul thanks to Schultz's keen eye and Snoopy's aplomb.	2003-11-14

An Internet phenomenon now on its third book, The Darwin Awards make for amusing reads for those who possess a little something dark in their humor.<br />The problem with this third edition is that it simply does not deliver the goods when compared with previous editions. Has the joke worn off or are these examples not all that great? Is Northcutt running low on new material? Perhaps. Maybe a few more years between editions might make for better stories. The filler material in the book is also weak and further illustrates that there is not much here.<br />Truth is, The Darwin Awards website is better than this book.

As a family that has abandoned the city and suburbs for the countryside, the very presence of a book like John Seymour's &quot;The Self-sufficient Life and How to Live It&quot; is enough to inspire fits of joy. A perfect companion to works like Hemenway's &quot;Gaia's Garden&quot; and Mollison's &quot;Permaculture: A Designer's Manual,&quot; this book is a must for would-be urbanites fleeing the cities. Covering every topic relevant to self-sufficient, sustainable living and farm life, Seymour's classic provides a great way to start a different life. An update from the venerable mid-Seventies edition of the book, this 2002 release is a fine improvement.<br />The book has quite a bit going for it:<br /> 1. Beautifully made, illustrated and laid-out, this book is meant to last and be used readily and often. Typical Dorling Kindersley quality.<br /> 2. An eye-friendly typeface and bright, semi-gloss pages make this easy reading.<br /> 3. The shear breadth of the information here is outstanding. Packed into 306 letter-sized pages are the following chapters:<br />  *The Meaning of Self-Sufficiency<br />  *Food from the Garden<br />  *Food from Animals<br />  *Food from the Fields<br />  *Food from the Wild<br />  *In the Dairy<br />  *In the Kitchen<br />  *Brewing &amp; Wine-making<br />  *Energy &amp; Waste<br />  *Crafts &amp; Skills<br />  *Things You Need to Know<br /> 4. Good specifics on all the categories of info listed above. You should be able to get started on your way to being people of the soil. Need to know how to kill, gut, and prepare your cattle? It's in here. Got a hankering to get off the electrical grid altogether? Helpful windmill buying advice is here. Can't tell rye from barley? You will after reading this book.<br /> 5. A helpful list of contacts and companies that can get you started on your dream are included.<br />But there are issues amid all this helpful advice:<br /> 1. The book makes some references to US-specific qualifiers on info, but it is quintessentially British. Some of the very helpful info simply does not apply to American would-be farmers.<br /> 2. There's a lot of the &quot;green&quot; credo here. Some of it is a bit condescending to anyone who doesn't share the author's opinions of life outside the farm. How well the reader handles this is up to the reader.<br /> 3. While the book is certainly comprehensive, considering how complex a shift from urban to rural living can be, it could have gone even deeper. (I know that I still had questions.) The book probably could have been twice its length and would still be a bargain.<br /> 4. Much of the advice here comes from a lone methodology for approaching self-sufficiency. Despite the update, there are some more cutting edge permaculture methods that can be more satisfying than what we find in Seymour's book.<br />All in all, despite the cons, this is a fine primer on self-sufficiency.

Ward makes the story come alive for young people with simpler wording and bits of rhyme here and there.<br />As classic as the story itself is, it is the pen and watercolor illustrations that make this book a must read. This has to be one of the most beautiful children's books I have ever seen, with artwork that is Caldecott Medal-worthy. The rich detail and lush colorations make the animals of the tale simply pop out of the page. Using a \\"flyover\\" view also gives the drawings a cinematic feel that enlivens the action.<br />And just when you think you've finished the story, Ward provides backstory helps to not only understand the history of the tale, but also the choices she made for populating the barnyard. With this guide the reader will see that the author has featured rare \\"heirloom\\" breeds of animals in her illustration; the guide gives background on each breed and points each out on the story's pages. Truly a wonderful addition that enhances the enjoyment of the book for adults.<br />Very highly recommended!	2003-10-13

It may have had seven predecessors, but as of the eighth iteration (as designer guides go) I would say that Better Homes and Gardens' &quot;New Decorating Book&quot; has reached the state of the art. No weekend home transformation warrior's library would be complete without this guide.<br />Lovely to look at and overflowing with fashion forward advice, &quot;New Design Book&quot; combines several design help books into one. Advertising itself as a &quot;4-in-1&quot; deal, this authoritative tome features:<br />1. A Dream Book - How can you not dream with hundreds of envy-inspiring photos ripe with a variety of styles of that will set your mind a-wanderin'?<br />2. A Workbook - Tired of just dreaming? This guide will help you put it all into play.<br />3. A Room-by-Room Decorating Planner - The layout features one section of the typical house at a time, focusing your projects. Step-by-step instructions get you up and going.<br />4. A Design Primer - Don't know tan from taupe? The design primer give you the basics that every interior designer knows by heart. Color, harmony, symmetry - it's all here.<br />At well over four hundred pages and plenty of advice amid the numerous pictures, this is one of those books that will takes weeks to go through. The text isn't lost in the graphics, though. The book is jammed full of helpful instructions. There are &quot;Do's and Don't's&quot;, side-by-side before and after pictures, comparison shots of multiple interpretations of themes, and the latest advice on textures, do-it-yourself projects, and even URLs to the leading edge designs updated daily at Better Homes and Gardens' website.<br />Better Homes and Gardens not only excelled with their advice, but the quality of the book itself makes it practically worthy of coffee table book status. A few of the best aspects of the book's own design are:<br />* A thoughtful and well conceived layout.<br />* An excellent graphic design that highlights rather than distracts from text and images.<br />* A superb use of color throughout the text focuses the readers attention on details.<br />I recently reviewed Michael Payne's first design book and I must say that it pales in comparison to this one. Simply loaded with information, &quot;New Design Book&quot; sets a high mark that other books would be hard pressed to match. No single review can do justice to the outstanding quality, sheer helpfulness, and up-to-date stylings found in this guide. After spending several days engrossed in it, I'm not certain it has any real weaknesses. A must have.<br />This one deservedly gets five stars.es.<BR>* A superb use of color throughout the text focuses the readers attention on details.<br />I recently reviewed Michael Payne's first design book and I must say that it pales in comparison to this one.

Given that almost all of those many Bibles released in the last forty years are paraphrases, why not skip the rest and go with the very first modern paraphrase, J. B. Phillips' &quot;The New Testament in Modern English&quot;?<br />Written in 1958, the Phillips Translation is, quite simply, one of the most dynamic and energetic Bible translations ever put on paper. It seethes with action, power, and transcendence. Jesus is shown as fully man (and yet fully God) in a way that makes us love Him even more. Phillips captures Jesus in such a way that we truly recognize Him as our brother, but always as our Lord, too.<br />But Phillips gives us more than simply a passionate Jesus of the Gospels, he gives us the gentle, yet forceful Epistles, emphasizing the fact that they were truly pastoral letters. He phrases things so beautifully that they come alive and feed the heart. For instance, contrast his translation of Romans 12:1-2 with other recent paraphrases:<br />Phillips:<br />&quot;With eyes wide open to the mercies of God, I beg you, my brothers, as an act of intelligent worship, to give him your bodies, as a living sacrifice, consecrated to him and acceptable by him. Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould, but let God re-mould your minds from within, so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all his demands and moves towards the goal of true maturity.&quot;<br />New Living Translation:<br />&quot;And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice--the kind he will accept. When you think of what he has done for you, is this too much to ask? Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will know what God wants you to do, and you will know how good and pleasing and perfect his will really is.&quot;<br />The Message:<br />&quot;So here's what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life--your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life--and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it. Unlike the culture around you, always dragging you down to its level of immaturity, God brings the best out of you, develops well-formed maturity in you.&quot;<br />Doesn't the Phillips do a better job of capturing the power of Paul's writing while also avoiding the pitfalls of difficult wording? (Nor does it pander to cultural relativism.) Despite not being a word for word translation, it sticks remarkably to the ideas of the original text as shown below in the more literal King James Version translation:<br />&quot;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot;<br />Having translated the Book of Romans myself back in college, I can appreciate the singlehanded success Phillips enjoys in capturing the tenor of the Greek, while simultaneously not being condescending or too loose with ideas. In my many years of reading the Phillips Translation, I have yet to find a single verse that imparts a controversy that would create any doctrinal questions.<br />The nature of the Phillips translation makes it an excellent Bible to simply read. Phillips originally did not include verse markings, so the text was not broken up by numbers, making it more book-like. For this reason, this is one of the finest devotional Bibles written.<br />If there is to be any quibble, it lies in the fact that Phillips was British and not American, so his translation does have a few phrases that are better suited to British English than American. But these are few and far between, being far less noticeable than some of the liberties that American translators have taken in many of the modern Bible paraphrases. Some may also fault the fact that Phillips does not attempt to update direct quotes from the Old Testament when they are used in the New Testament. (Different revisions exists, some which use the New King James when quoting OT texts and others with the American Standard Version.) This may seem a bit odd to some when the style of phrasing changes, but since Phillips did not translate an Old Testament, it is a translator's prerogative that can be justified.<br />For those who would like to get a feel for the Phillips New Testament, it is available online. My personal take is that it is the best modern paraphrase available, is a great companion for Bible study (though not as the primary source - stick with a literal translation for that), and is particularly well-suited for continuous reading. J. B. Phillip's work continues to amaze me with its superb blend of simple modernity, accuracy, and power.

Michael Payne, the congenial host and designer of HGTV's \\"Designing for the Sexes\\", finally has a book out. A must for fans of the show, \\"Let's Ask Michael\\" is a good design book that could have been great.<br />The book's layout is based upon actual customer questions that Michael has fielded over the years, most pages showing a before or after image of the rooms discussed (or something similar.) The hundred queries are a mix of broad and specific, covering the major rooms of the house. Michael answers each with that comforting grandfatherly style that he's known for. His solutions are top-notch and are the reason he is so sought after.<br />If only the book were better.<br />Though \\"Let's Ask Michael\\" captures Payne at his best and has roots in his show, the question/answer format may not the best way to approach a first book attempt. I'd much rather see Michael do a more typical design book and leave this format for a followup. His ideas do come through, but are somewhat constrained by the format. Also, the large typeface, though easy to read, masks the fact that the answers given are not very long. Large and overly bold side splashes on the page also consume a good amount of page real estate. Added together, stripping the splashes and cutting the type size would probably cut the 191 pages down to about 140 - truly \\"Design Lite.\\" (The credits note that Payne's son designed the book. Oh well.) As for me, I want to know more. This lack cuts the rating on this book by two stars at least.<br />Still, \\"Let's Ask Michael\\" is an enjoyable work simply because the author is fascinating. I was surprised to read in his online bio that his background is in physics and mathematics; he worked in the computer industry for many years before bolting to interior design. He's a genuine talent, so for the next book let's get more of Michael's ideas and less filler.	2003-09-22

Accused of eating a chicken pie without permission, scaring the neighbor's cats, and tearing his owner's camel hair coat, he finds himself shipped off to a posh obedience school. But Ike, being quite the ham, exaggerates his \\"imprisonment\\" in a series of letters to his accusing owner, Mrs. LaRue. Despite his protestations concerning the food, the \\"guards\\", and the lousy medical care he receives (being unfairly labeled a \\"hypochondriac\\") while in the clutches of the Igor Brotweiler school, his judgmental owner never springs the poor pooch.<br />Mark Teague brings his pretentious pup to glowing life in a series of truth vs. fiction illustrations that show Ike's reality in contrast with the imagined conditions he portrays in his notes home. It's difficult not to smile at the lengths Ike goes to in order to prove himself innocent, while pleading for his owner to rescue him from a fate worse than death.<br />Is Ike justified in the end? Let's just say that all dogs have their day and Ike's is better than most.<br />This is one of those exceedingly rare books that will appeal to children AND parents. The large, lively graphics, wit, and overall cleverness in concept make this an endearing classic already. Even my three year old son, who can in no way understand many of the sly jokes, repeatedly wished to have us read this one - always a great endorsement. On first reading I thought the book was a little much, but it grows on you, getting funnier with each reading. I've never really seen a children's book like this one before and for sheer flair \\"Dear Mrs. LaRue\\" gets a big thumbs up.	2003-09-16

S. Lewis. As much as the latter has been a favorite of many, the lesser-known Tozer is  - for me -  an even better expositor of the nature of Christian reality in a dying world. Tozer's remarkable adherence to the Bible, his knowledge of ancient Christian texts (and their authors), and his unique blend of modern evangelical thought and Middle Ages mysticism make him a 20th Century writer without peer.<br />In this work, Tozer concentrates on the attributes of God. So deep are the words here that despite the text's slim 117 pages, it is difficult to digest the sage wisdom. I'm a fast reader, but three hours of reading only got me to page 70.<br />The twenty-three chapters include:<br />* The Holy Trinity<br />* The Self-existence of God<br />* The Divine Omniscience<br />* The Faithfulness of God<br />* The Justice of God<br />* The Sovereignty of God<br />and so on. Each section opens with a prayer, then moves into keen analysis, pulling in the Bible, old hymns, the writings of the Church fathers, and more. And each chapter is better than the next; I have never read a more quotable work, nor one more filled with sources for meditation.<br />Books like this belong in every serious Christian's library. Tozer's penetrating observations cross all denomination lines and conflict with no Christian doctrinal position I know of. There is no controversy here with the sole exception that 1961's &quot;The Knowledge of the Holy&quot; shows the paucity of genuine Christian thought among today's writers. By looking back, looking at the present, and gazing into the future, Tozer gives us a view of God for the ages.<br />One of the finest Christian books ever written and possibly the best on the nature of God.	2003-09-16

Founder of The Sierra Club, this lover of the western forests' legacy to our generation is the National Park system, through which millions of acres of unique ecosystems have been set aside for everyone's enjoyment.<br />\\"Muir: Nature Writings\\" is a collection of the writings of this Scottish expatriate who first stepped foot in America in 1849 as an eleven year old brawler and budding naturalist.  Blessed with a childhood mastery of Latin and Greek as well as a discerning and disciplined eye, the learned boy possessed a poet's heart, a scientist's mind, and a theologian's soul.  A genius, who as a teen whittled precision wooden scientific instruments, Muir used his diverse skills to vividly portray nature's life and death struggles on his family's Wisconsin farm in \\"My Boyhood & Youth.\\"  Here we find Muir learning to swim by observing frogs or recollecting the mindless slaughter of the Earth's most numerous bird, the now-extinct passenger pigeon, a forlorn tale that foreshadows the conservationist he was to become.<br />While in college polishing his mechanical skills, Muir was detoured into studying botany.  Dropping out to make powered tools for factories, an accident left him rethinking that detour; he forsook the factory and walked across America.  His journey led him to the Sierra Mountains, chronicled in \\"My First Summer in the Sierra.\\"  Now working as a shepherd, Muir drove his flock through Yosemite while making detailed nature studies.  Marveling at the natural beauty of the land he would eventually champion as one of the first National Parks, Muir wrote: \\"We are now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us.  Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the sun, - a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal.\\"<br />Muir's writings here run the gamut from analytical to thrilling.  In \\"Stickeen\\", the author and a canine companion cheat death while stranded mid-storm between crevasses of an Alaskan glacier.  (A self-taught authority on glaciers, Muir would eventually have one in Alaska bear his name.)  \\"The Mountains of California\\" is an in-depth look at the geologic formations, plants, and animals of the region.  In this piece, he tells of being stuck on the side of volcanic Mt. Shasta, staying warm in the bitter cold by nestling up to steam vents.  Muir also laments the loss of the vast meadows of the San Joaquin Valley as he discusses how to make a living post-Gold Rush by raising bees for honey.<br />What makes Muir so unique when compared with today's environmentalists is this belief that we can live in harmony with Creation if we take simple steps to prevent despoiling it.  In \\"The American Forests\\" he wrote: \\"No place is too good for good men, and there is still room....  Every place is made better by them.  Let them be as free to pick gold and gems from the hills, to cut and hew, dig and plant, for homes and bread....\\"  Muir's balanced view of Man's place in the wilderness overwhelmingly reflects his Christian faith, for he never fails to stand in awe of each living thing God has made.  That our government leaders were so swayed by Muir's writing attests to the power of his \\"holy\\" persuasion.  All of us are indebted to John Muir's single-minded devotion to America's wilderness.<br />(\\"Muir: Nature Writings\\" is part of the Library of America series.  This diverse collection of the writings of great Americans ranges from sermons of early American preachers to analysis of the Vietnam War.  The works of Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Ulysses S.

Author of the popular &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, Stephen Hawking is back with a book that attempts to bring to the masses Einstein's Relativity Theory, p-branes, black holes, cosmic strings, dark matter, imaginary time, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, and all things Planck. Despite the mind boggling task of trying to make cutting edge physics accessible to those who wouldn't know a boson from a bison, Hawking more or less succeeds.<br />The basis for this work is the search for the elusive &quot;M-Theory&quot; that will tie all of theoretical physics up in a nice neat bow. But as Hawking himself attempts to bring many disparate ideas together under one aegis, it becomes readily apparent that &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell&quot; will only spawn more questions than it answers. In fact, the reader may actually finish this book and get the nutty idea that science, in truth, CAN'T answer all questions about how we got here and where we are going. Hawking himself even tosses off asides that perhaps some things are only known by God.<br />Even though Hawking tries to present the laymen with a good overview of what is happening on all those physicists' chalkboards in Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton, and Stanford, some discussions come off better than others. The section on general and special relativity was well explained and to the point. His arguments for and against time travel and whether the future can be predicted are also well done. The chapter wondering if our future will be like what we see on Star Trek was a bit weak and a little gratuitous considering that he makes certain we know that he was actually in a Star Trek:TNG episode playing poker against Data, Einstein, and Newton (and winning, too.) That chapter also felt a bit out of place as it borders more on the sociological. The final chapter in which he discusses brane theory, though, is fascinating and quite mindbending as he finds a way to account for phenomena (energy loss, dimensional errors, and missing gravity) that still elude most scientists.<br />Will everyone be able to follow &quot;Universe in a Nutshell&quot;? No. Hawking could not, for me, make his discussion of imaginary time graspable. Imaginary numbers I understand, but telling time with them? Some concepts are better left to others. For the most part, though, much of the book will be understood by those who slow down reading long enough to truly think about what Hawking is saying. And if you can't follow the text, the computer-generated illustrations are helpful (although they have an oddly sterile and dated appearance - possibly because computer graphics technology advances so swiftly. Where's a time machine when you really need one?)<br />While Hawking searches for the M-Theory and a place to put his inevitable Noble Prize, other philosophies and religions attempt to explain the nature of the universe. The world's most famous living scientist may have a scientific answer for us, but for anyone looking to sum up all things, his &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell&quot; is only one small book in a sea of tomes attempting to explain life, the universe, and everything.y, though, is fascinating and quite mindbending as he finds a way to account for phenomena (energy loss, dimensional errors, and missing gravity) that still elude most scientists.<br />Will everyone be able to follow &quot;Universe in a Nutshell&quot;?

Martyn Lloyd-Jones's \\"Spiritual Depression: Its Causes and Its Cure\\" is nearly forty years old, the truth it speaks to a generation lost amid a plethora of pop-psychology books is timeless. Jones, long the pastor of Westminster Chapel, gives readers the benefit of his many years of preaching and counseling, paving the way for the lost to find their way home.<br />Psychology and Christianity have two dichotomous worldviews that cannot be shoehorned into each no matter how hard anyone tries. Psychology attempts to bolster the inner self, while Christianity says that the inner self is so hopelessly corrupt that it must be replaced with something entirely new. To this end Jones points out that all depression has its root in sin and works from that point to lead readers into an understanding that only in Christ can release from the bondage of self come.<br />In the pages of this work, we find Jones addressing the following issues that many who are downcast find themselves afflicted by:<br />* Lack of a foundation in Christ<br />* Lack of clarity<br />* Poor spiritual balance between the mind, heart, and will<br />* Inability to receive forgiveness for all their sins<br />* Inability to move beyond past failures<br />* Fear of the future<br />* Placing too much confidence in emotions<br />* Faulty love of oneself and a general contempt for others<br />* Lack of faith<br />* Seeing only bad and not good<br />* Bondage to dead legalism<br />* Failing to recognize false teachings<br />* Weariness<br />* Lack of discipline<br />* Failure to handle trials appropriately<br />* Failure to respond correctly to chastening<br />* Bitterness<br />Jones does a marvelous job of breaking down each of these traits found in those in the doldrums and sheds the light of Scripture on each as he takes a solely Christian look at the root of these problems and how to deal with them biblically. Best of all, at no time does he attempt to mix in solutions from pop-psychology in order to achieve wholeness. His answers are more real and more true to the heart of the depressed. Anyone who feels downtrodden will take enormous comfort in the gentle, but firm words here.<br />While the advice here is timeless, the book does suffer slightly from having an older writing style that contrasts with the flow of more modern works. Those who have not read anything older than twenty years will find some of Jones's writing techniques to be quaint and very British, but if you have read any works by his contemporary, C.S. Lewis, you will be familiar with the style of British writers of that day and will find nothing daunting in Jones.<br />In the end, as a counteracting work to the psychobabble so pronounced today, \\"Spiritual Depression\\" is without peer and I heartily encourage anyone who is looking for true Christian counsel to read this book - Jones's words are a life-giving balm for weary souls. Few books of this type exist today and better words have never been written on this subject.to achieve wholeness. His answers are more real and more true to the heart of the depressed.

Illustrated by David Allen Sibley, with contributing text by a host of bird authorities, this work is the ultimate companion to Sibley's field guides. Anyone can gain a greater appreciation for our feathered friends by picking up this book.<br />Crammed with useful information, the guide opens with an understanding of how birds fly, their anatomy, and intellectual capabilities. There are chapters on origins, classification methods, bird behavior, migration, communication, and breeding. Also included are overviews of habitat distinctions, populations, and conservation.<br />This general format is carried over into the largest section of the book - a comprehensive look at all the families of North American avians. For instance, each family of birds (e.g. - Hummingbirds, Vireos) will have chapters within the text providing specific analysis of:<br />*Taxonomy<br />*Adaptations to Lifestyle<br />*Habitats<br />*Food and Foraging<br />*Breeding<br />*Vocalizations<br />*Migration<br />*Conservation<br />*Accidental Species<br />This clear breakdown by sections makes it a simple task to compare the migration strategies of Vireos to that of Hummingbirds, for instance. Given that all these sections exist uniformly for each family, anyone seeking to know more about a particular family of birds can easily find what they are looking for. Even complete families of birds that are merely accidental are listed here (e.g. - Accentors.)<br />&quot;The Sibley Guide to Bird Behavior&quot; benefits not only from its methodical layout, but also a profusion of David Sibley's artwork. And while some have dubbed his illustrations merely functional, I find them to be very good. The superb quality of the guide itself is also a huge plus, making it a sort of &quot;mini-coffeetable&quot; book. Bright, thick pages with clear text and plenty of open space make the guide very easy to read. Because of the layout, it can be read in small chunks, too, so its hefty 587 pages are easily digestible.<br />There is something here for any birder, no matter their level of expertise, as well. I've been birding for more than twenty-five years and yet I still picked up plenty of great facts.<br />Lastly, a word on the conservation sections of the book: they are both heartening and disheartening in their factualness about the survivability of different bird families. Yes, Man has harmed some avian families, but many others have been aided by our encroachments. The guide is balanced in its view, too, that some species of North American birds that are extinct (or close to it) were never that populous to begin with and may have been doomed over time anyway, no matter what Man did to their habitats. Still, it does not shrink from blaming us for devastating some species - the passenger pigeon, for instance - nor does it excuse us from continuing to work to better the plight of all bird species around the world.<br />Absolutely deserving of a five star rating, &quot;The Sibley Guide to Bird Behavior&quot; is a superb book on its own, and even better with the Sibley Field Guide series. Highly recommended to all, particularly bird lovers.Because of the layout, it can be read in small chunks, too, so its hefty 587 pages are easily digestible. <BR>There is something here for any birder, no matter their level of expertise, as well. I've been birding for more than twenty-five years and yet I still picked up plenty of great facts. <br />Lastly, a word on the conservation sections of the book: they are both heartening and disheartening in their factualness about the survivability of different bird families.

Sporting perhaps the worst cover foisted off on a name author, &quot;How to Write Killer Fiction&quot; has a lot more going for it on the inside than the outside. Writing about a topic she knows well, Carolyn Wheat gives readers the wealth of her experience in writing mystery and suspense novels.<br />Broken up into three sections, Wheat examines the differences between mystery (puzzles, myth, clues, intellectual satisfaction) and suspense (nightmare, fairy tale, surprises, emotional satisfaction) in the first two and the correct way to approach penning both. She delves into the writing details of subgenres of mysteries that feature the police procedural, hardboiled detectives, and amateur sleuths, while flipping the coin to highlight the ordinariness of the heroes in suspense fiction.<br />Highly helpful in these two parts are the in-depth analysis of the nature of story arcs and how they should best be played out in the two genres. Wheat provides insider tips on how to establish a flow that will not jar avid fans of each genre. Also stellar is the idea that at their core these two genres mirror the heroic epics of long ago, myth and fairy tale being the basis for all writing that ultimately resonates with the reader. And fortunately for us, the essence of myth and fairy tale are condensed here for those hoping to make their own works more lasting.<br />Part three focuses on general writing tips and looks at the styles of the &quot;Blank Pager&quot; and the &quot;Outliner&quot;  - respectively those who write not having a complete plan and those who are meticulous in their conceptions - pointing out the strengths and weakness inherent in each approach and how best to learn from the counterpart style. Editing the novel is afforded quite a bit of coverage at the end and much of the advice here runs to the spare style favored by both today's readers and their audience.<br />To this end, the author has written a &quot;How To&quot; that doesn't mince words and goes straight to the heart of how to write great mystery and suspense novels. The book moves along at a clip and is brimming with helpful advice. I don't even write in those two genres and I found myself getting quite a bit from the book.<br />Very good and well recommended.ight to the heart of how to write great mystery and suspense novels.

What is the sound of no one laughing?<br />Answer: the same sound as one would hear in a room wherein someone is reading Dave Barry's sophomore novel, \\"Tricky Business.\\"<br />Good grief! Does it get more soporific than this?<br />After a long time avoiding fiction, soaking up facts in the nonfiction world, I returned with a vengeance hoping to bolster my own writing skills. What I have found is one pretentious, pointless, or boring read after another.<br />Surely Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist Dave Barry can save the day!<br />But, alas, \\"Tricky Business\\" has as much wit as a coma victim. Most thirteen year old boys have a more fully realized arsenal of funny scenarios rattling around in their bags of scatology, as well.<br />Writing about his favorite topic, Miami sleaze, Barry introduces us to a wasted bar band, a couple wrinkled elders acting half their age, the Mob (of course) and all their lackeys, a down-on-his-luck ship captain, a frustrated single mom working beneath her abilities as a cocktail waitress, and a surly conch, all converging on the aptly named casino boat, The Extravaganza of the Seas, during a tropical storm. There's a plot to doublecross the mobsters and, well...actually that's the only real plot. Can't really make much of any subplots worth mentioning. Sadly, the parts - which do have potential - never add up to anything. Three hundred and change pages later and you've got one giant ho-hum... and the aforementioned lack of mirth doesn't help, either.<br />What really disturbs me about this book is its mean spirit. Barry has a warning at the beginning about the language, since many of his readers objected to the obscenities in his previous novel, \\"Big Trouble.\\" I forget which comedian told the story that his mother warned him never to work \\"blue\\", and I can tell you that Barry should have heeded that guy's mom. The profanity, adult situations, and grisly nature of \\"Tricky Business\\" just make it wearying. A humorist should know that the F-word just isn't all that funny anymore. Someone like P. J. O'Rourke can write a piece and make it totally ribald, but his choice of funnier (and cleaner) words for profanities takes his work to higher level. Barry, so clever in his column, should know this, but he abandons wisdom in favor of lowbrow mucking about. Boo.<br />Hopefully Barry will rebound with his next novel, but he's got to work his fiction-writing chops up a notch. The writing here is just poor: bad plotting, underdeveloped characters, and a pacing that needs a transfusion of adrenaline. When your novel isn't funny, lacks suspense, and doesn't really say anything about the human condition, it's time to get the number of a good book doctor.just isn't all that funny anymore.

What is the nature of the jarring nightmare we call \\"Modern Life?\\"<br />In his astonishing followup to the Booker Prize-winning \\"The Remains of the Day\\", Kazuo Ishiguro examines this question as he weaves a world of dreams in which an internationally known pianist - simply known here as \\"Mr. Ryder\\" - is thrust into a m&ouml;bius strip-like, unnamed Germanic town filled with strangers he knows well. His reasons for being there have not only to do with a performance he is to give, but a mission he must fulfill. This mission, to his dismay, is poorly planned and has no structure, yet he is confident of his winning the town over while, along the way, saving its very soul.<br />His past a shadow, he meets a woman and her son, who are introduced to him by a kindly porter who hopes Ryder will rescue his daughter and grandchild from their despair, while also putting in a few good words to the town about the necessity of supporting bellman across the city. Men and women drift into the pianist's life, all broken and needy. Like Jesus, he is clung to by anyone who can capture a morsel of his time or his thoughts on any topic they hold dear. All the while, Ryder fights a mysterious exhaustion, Time having abandoned him to his fate.<br />Written in a style in which dialogue (\\"monologue\\" may be more apt) seems to have escaped from a Howard Hawks film and found refuge in the author's pen, \\"The Unconsoled\\" jerks from scene to scene, from encounter to encounter, Ryder hurtling to an unknown future even as he listens to the bleatings of the sheep who want only to touch the hem of his cloak to find healing. But Ryder is no savior, he himself being lost within the twists and turns of a town turned inside itself. When the book finally comes to its last page, there can only be questions.<br />\\"The Unconsoled\\" is a novel nearly without precedent. One has to retreat to the dark meanderings of Kafka to find a protagonist like Mr. Ryder. And while perhaps not as doomed as Josef K., Ryder's hell is one that many of us who feel that the deluge of info and the relentless pace of 21st Century life has left us drawn and quartered will understand.<br />Be forewarned, though. This is not a neat and tidy work. The ending does not answer everything; \\"The Unconsoled\\" is more a meditation on life than a taut mystery or thriller. It will satisfy those who desire to be challenged by its story, but not those who seek a sleek summation.<br />If there is one negative to this book it must be the length. Once you have read one multipage monologue after another, you wonder if the author could have spared some words and yet made his point.  At more than five hundred pages, all rendered tightly on the page, \\"The Unconsoled\\" cannot be considered a quick read and may suffer a bit for the wordiness, particularly given the nature of its theme.<br />Still, for those interested in a work completely outside that of mainstream fiction, it would be hard to go wrong with \\"The Unconsoled\\".

Rarely does a children's book come along that appeals more to adults than kids (Shel Silverstein's \\"Uncle Shelby's A B Z Book\\" comes to mind), but for out and out cynicism nothing can beat Lane Smith's \\"The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country\\".<br />Smith has established himself as a major force in children's books winning many awards not only his zany illustration style that has graced many other authors' titles, but also for the stories he authors alone. His campy and somewhat bitter look at the world guarantees an amusing story, and his off-kilter approach endears him to children.<br />In this latest work, Smith revisits his Hocky family after more than a decade, this time putting the hapless city-dwellers out in the hollers of the country. Writing slice of life mini-stories, he follows the Hockys as they are overwhelmed by their new surroundings. Ineptly stumbling through the adjustment, they make the reader wonder if they will eventually be consumed by a pack of roaming wolves. Yet somehow, against all odds, the family turn its misfortunes into triumph at the conclusion.<br />The spare Art Deco meets Cubist illustrations are rendered on kraft paper-like pages and are charming in their retro look. The style makes it seem as if the world is coming apart at the joints. And while the appearance of the cover art and pages makes the book look \\"cheap\\" it is well made and definitely high quality.<br />Younger children will get lost in this book, though. The \\"wink-wink\\" style of humor will sail over most kids' heads, appealing more to adults. As a family that did just what the Hocky's did, jettisoning suburban life for a \\"Green Acres\\" existence, my wife and I howled at the scenarios the author depicts - they were spot on. Our son, though, didn't get the jokes, but still laughed because we were.<br />Loved the book, but maybe for mom and dad more than for the kiddies. Still, every child needs a book in his collection that mommy and daddy want to pick up and read first, and \\"The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country\\" is just that book.t, and \\"The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country\\" is just that book.	2003-08-28

William Gibson, unofficial father of the cyberpunk movement, made a legion of fans with his classic work, \\"Neuromancer.\\" A futurist of sorts, his keen eye for trends makes him a fascinating author to follow.<br />But with his latest effort, \\"Pattern Recognition\\", he stumbles - badly.<br />Cayce Pollard - named after Edgar, the so-called \\"Sleeping Prophet\\" - is the go-to gal when trendy fashion houses need to know what will work with ever-fickle fadsters. Blessed with a preternatural ability to instinctively know hot from not, she finds herself hired into Blue Ant, the chi-chiest of the chi-chi. But their designs are less on fashion and more on finding the source of \\"The Footage\\", mysterious snippets of an ethereal Internet movie that has captured the attention of everyone from a Japanese cult to international spies, American hackers, cryptic cryptographers, meme marketeers, and film fanatics.<br />Peril, and a vicious case of jet lag, nags at Cayce as she plunges into the mystery even as she struggles with the unresolved case of her spy for hire father, among the missing at Ground Zero on September 11th. Her mother e-mails her claiming to hear him speak warnings from the dead to his daughter on blank audio tapes. Her apartment in New York is broken into, as is her temporary residence, and a power-hungry cohort threatens her with secret knowledge only her therapist should know: Cayce's deathly afraid of The Michelin Man.<br />The many players in the book converge from parts all over the world and eventually wind up in the very place Cayce surmised long ago upon first viewing the footage was the source. It's all thrilling and top-notch, not to mention cool beyond words.<br />For three hundred pages, this is as good as it gets in modern techno-fiction. But in what I can only call a \\"complete implosion\\" this novel ends with perhaps one of the most singularly inept finales ever foisted off on readers by an A-level author. What was easily a four-star book punts two of those stars for this reason alone.<br />Why so bad? Well, Gibson commits numerous sins:<br />- He has one character come out of practically nowhere to deliver the synthesis of almost everything that happened in the previous three hundred  or so pages. That is a first-time novelist's mistake.<br />- Readers think they are getting a firecracker finale, but it fizzles out without so much as a pop. It's the kind that leaves the reader screaming, \\"That's it?!\\" If I were to summarize it here, most would agree. But you'll have to read it for yourself.<br />- The ultimate reason for the footage existing is truly lightweight. The speculation is more interesting. When the payoff is not as thrilling as what the characters have surmised throughout the book, the author has serious rewriting to do. Those closest to Gibson should have let him know this.<br />- The major subplot of the book also dries up and blows away. The major plot is a disappointment, so the reader prays for something, anything to happen with the big subplot, right? Don't hold your breath.<br />- Much of the peril is revealed to be contrived and for reasons that make little sense to thinking people when the pieces come together. It logically does not follow and when paired with the explanation behind the footage cannot stand up to any scrutiny.<br />In short, I am astonished that this book saw the light of day without a rewrite of the ending. I think that many readers will feel that \\"Pattern Recognition\\" was a complete waste of time, both the author's and theirs. We can only hope that Gibson can someday hence capture again the genie in the bottle that made him the hero of the Internet set and a writer to always watch.se stars for this reason alone.<br />Why so bad?

A special operative  tracking malfeasance as it relates to books and lit (in a world that craves Shakespeare more than Spears), Thursday finds herself blackmailed into retreiving a Goliath Corporation enforcer she previously left trapped in Poe's &quot;The Raven.&quot; Her new husband erased by the time-traveling ChronoGuards, Thursday winds up stuck in an alternate timeline she can't undo. Add to this the mysterious appearance of an unknown Shakesparean work, throw in a bizarre set of coincidences that seem bent on wiping her out as well , then top it off with her time-hopping fugitive father showing her the end of the world will come in a few weeks unless she can stop it, and our poor heroine is up the Thames without a paddle.<br />But all is not lost, for Thursday has a new trick up her sleeve: she can jump into books without the aid of her uncle's Prose Portal (from the first book.) Her skill brings the attention of Jurisfiction, a motley assortment of literary figures who are responsible for maintaining the integrity of all written material. Apprenticed to Miss Haversham, she quickly builds her skills to the point that she can even enter into the verboten Poe books, saving the world along the way.<br />In what can only be described as a whirlwind of a comic sci-fi thriller, &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot; finds Fforde ratcheting up the tension to unbearable levels. His writing chops are clearly a step up from &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, but good grief! This book has enough plots, characters, action, and mayhem to be ten books.

Taking references from the era's periodicals that covered the style, \\"The Craftsman\\" and \\"The House\\", Hitchmough provides historical background that seeks to makes sense of the style. Simplicity of design evolved from anti-Victorianism. Cues from nature came from the burgeoning naturalist and conservation movements, along with interest in all things Asian. Older building practices were combined with new advances.<br />The lifestyle portions of the book point out how radically different from Victorian ideals was the new movement. The roles of the master and mistress of the home showed them as more at tune with the outside world, more aware of personal health and fitness, and far more sexually aware (more about this further on.) How the Arts & Crafts home functioned from day to day is discussed in detail, as well.<br />The book covers the style as best portrayed in Britain and the United States. Designers from both sides of the pond are detailed. The lush photography of Martin Charles wraps up the pretty package.<br />But there are distinct problems with the book. It doesn't have a real niche. It's too wordy and historical to be a good coffee table book. The layout of chapters by room, while possibly good for highlighting the lifestyle choices, makes this a hard book to use as a reference manual for the style. There are glaring limitations, too. Far too much focus is given to a few designers and homes that drove the movement - it is not as broad an overview of all designers and practices as one would like. And while the lifestyle portions are interesting, there seems to be an overt focus on sexuality that I found peculiar for a book of this type.<br />In short, I believe the book tries to accomplish too much and therefore fails to excel in any one aspect. By trying to shoehorn several books into one, the author has given us the average of other works. And that is less than fully satisfying for those of us looking for more in-depth analysis.<br />Still, for anyone seeking an overview of Arts & Crafts design and concepts as espoused in the lifestyle of the era, this is as good a place to start as any.

Well has Peter Bowerman got a profession for you!<br />&quot;The Well-Fed Writer&quot; dishes the dirt on what it takes to make up to a six-figure income doing commercial writing for businesses. Written in a style I can best describe as &quot;bar stool&quot; (as in &quot;Hey, buddy, let me tell you how I make a killing writing....&quot;), this book provides info on even the smallest aspects of accomplishing the goal of financial independence in what the author figures will be a six month startup time.<br />The first few chapters are dedicated to a bit of bragging on the author's part, assessing if the reader is cut out for the job, some cheerleading for the rest of the book, a general look at writing, the keys to being successful in this new venture, and how to approach being self-employed. Bowerman proceeds to get into the daily operation of a writing business, covering the topic with sprinkles of wit, some kernals of wisdom, and several dollops of personal anecdotes. He gives advice on a wide variety of topics, from maximizing profits by understanding end users and middlemen, to aggressively  marketing your work, dealing with the Internet, setting your rates and getting your money, pleasing the customer and more. The appendices include samples of forms for helping you  get started.<br />For a beginner, this book is quite helpful. It is wide-ranging and covers all the ins and outs of the biz fairly well. The breezy style makes for quick reading and never talks over the reader's head. (If anything, it's too casual.) The mix of advice and anecdotes also cements the process of how things work in real life versus &quot;theory.&quot;<br />But there are a few detractions.  Anyone looking for info on how to make a living writing for sources outside the corporate business world - magazine and newspaper articles, fiction and non-fiction, children's books, and other markets - is out of luck. Quite disappointing. Also, the style makes it difficult to isolate certains pieces of needed info; sometimes the helpful bits are buried amid filler and less-than-perfect layouts. Nor does it address how to overcome the inevitable writer's block that comes even when writing PR pieces and interviews.

Reading like a mix of the old TV show \\"Millennium\\" and the \\"Spy Kids\\" movies, but with a distinctly Christian worldview, The Veritas Project books follow the adventures of the Springfield family (Dad Nate, mom Sarah, and teen wondertwins, Elijah and Elisha) as they fight the bad guys with the help of the shadowy Veritas leader, Mr. Morgan, and the imprimatur of the President himself.<br />Summoned to aid a teen found in the middle of a rural road, his mind completely jumbled, the Springfields follow the boy's lead (during a rare lucid moment) to a youth center in Seattle. The center offers young runaways an unusual proposition, one which has potentially lethal consequences. The twins, posing as street kids in order to investigate for Veritas, are soon in the belly of the beast. After agreeing to the offer, they find themselves shuttled off to a mysterious school attempting to rewrite societal conventions, The Knight-Moore Academy.<br />Unaware of the exact location of the school, and unable to remember how they arrived, Elisha and Elijah are forced to match wits with many other kids and their eerie instructors. The school's staff - a generation and a couple continents removed from their kindred found in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" - attempt to rewire the students' thinking via clever verbal manipulations (and a few physical ones, as well.) Black becomes white and truth whatever one makes of it. While their parents search cross-country for them, the twins battle the brainwashing by holding true to God and His absolutes, becoming outsiders in the student body. Soon the social engineering wreaks \\"Lord of the Flies\\"-like consequences and what masquerades on the surface as a rarified prep school soon promises a learning experience no youth could ever imagine, even in their worst nightmares.<br />Frank Peretti's foray into youth fiction should please young readers looking for a thriller with solid, evangelical Christian values. A definite page-turner, \\"Nightmare Academy\\" has the needed creepiness balanced by biblical morality to give one the shivers without the guilt induced by reading something of questionable taste. The strong message that relativism is senseless and can only bring the downfall of our society, leaving us prey to nefarious forces, is reinforced on nearly every page.<br />Yet while this comprises the basic theme of the entire book, it comes off being heavy handed (though, sadly, not unlike many other books in this genre.) As Christian writers attempt to counter youth-oriented lit that fails to embrace traditional biblical values with sanitized, message-driven lit of their own, they've yet to really come up with books that drive truth home with more subtlety. C. S. Lewis' \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" is the archetype, but rarely has it been done better. Attempting to shoehorn concepts espoused in \\"The Left Behind \\" series into other writings also bedevils books like these.

The deus ex machina of a tornado rips down the fence and the cows do the rest, intermingling hopelessly, while refusing to hear the calls to come back to their respective sides. Forced to cooperate, the rival cowpokes finally drop the competition and work together. Can love be far behind?<br />Clearly there is plenty to like in the book. Many kids' picture books fall down in the text, but not here. Lisa Wheeler's long rhymes capture the reader's heart and flow nicely, complemented well by the sprawling, glowing, watercolor images of Kurt Cyrus. Together there is a synergy that makes this book oddly compelling. Little humorous touches abound - such as the cow names and the items tossed up by the tornado - that may mean more to adults than kids, so while my toddler son likes the book, his dad enjoys it even more. (At the cost of a star, the backstory of the book may be lost on the very young, who may not fully grasp love stories and weddings.)<br />With its large illustrations and silly/sweet story, this paean to the prairie is clearly designed to be read out loud and often. So pick out your best West Texas drawl, mosey on up to your favorite lil' pardner, and share the fun of \\"Sixteen Cows.\\"	2003-06-18

No.	Winner of the Caldecott Medal for best illustrated American children's book. \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" is a good looking, but curiously unengaging book for children. Certainly, it has nice woodblock-style illustrations with saturated colors, but the book suffers from failing to be a good read. It has few words, instead relying primarily on images to tell the story of an unlucky rabbit and his mouse friend that he launches in an airplane ...which inevitably gets stranded in a tree. How the rabbit solves the dilemma of the stuck plane piloted by his tiny buddy gives the story its humor.<br />Despite the accolades, books like this suffer from not being a great bedtime read since the narrative is so reliant on the images. And though it is driven by pictures, the story has enough words to make it the kind of book that very young children can't follow completely by merely looking at the illustrations.<br />The illustrations are also an issue. While they are clever and well done, I personally do not believe that this was the best illustrated book for children this year. Normally. there is little to debate when it comes to the Caldecott winners and runners-up, but as someone who goes through many children's books with my son, I simply do not agree with the Caldecott jury.<br />There are many excellent children's books that marry a great story with outstanding graphics. I found \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" to be lacking in the story itself. There is just not much there. My toddler son, who usually responds well to great books by asking for me to read them over and over, never asked for me to read this book more than once. Nor did he pick it up on his own to look at the pictures. There was not enough in the book to hold his interest. Ultimately, that's the best review of all.<br />Disappointing.	2003-06-11

Winner of Britain's Man Booker Prize (the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for Literature here), \\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel is a tale about the power of story and the quest for truth that can best be described as Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" set on its proverbial ear.  Call it \\"The Young Man, the Tiger, and the Sea.\\"<br />We'll get to the tiger later.<br />Named after a famed pool in Paris, Piscine Molitor Patel lives out his young life amid the gentle bustle of life in Pondicherry, India.  His father runs the sole zoo in the area, granting his son an education into the dark recesses of the animal psyche - a gift that will later save his life.  At a time when young men turn their eyes to the fairer sex, Pi - adopting the moniker of the symbolic number in an effort to distance himself from his given name - turns his to the heavens, beginning a spritual quest that makes him perhaps the only Hindu/Muslim/Christian in all of India.  Confounded by this spiritual synergy, everyone in his life is plunged into wondering about Pi's rationality.<br />Rationality is soon at hand when the Patel family elects to leave India amid the crumbling of Indira Gandhi's government.  When Pi is told that Canada is the destination and that the zoo animals will be sold off, he is left to grimly wonder about this new, foreign home.  Setting out by cargo ship with his entire family for North America - along with a few animals destined for zoos in the States - his world is further devastated when the ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.<br />While the lighthearted story of this boy occupies the first bit of the book, the tale becomes as deeply, searingly intimate as the ocean is expansive, for Pi must now battle the elements and his own mind.  If not for his friend Richard Parker, the only other survivor of the shipwreck, Pi tells us he surely would have gone mad.<br />But Richard is not what we imagine.  Gaining his name from an unfortunate clerical error, Richard Parker is far less of a man and far more of a 450 pound Bengal tiger.  The ensuing tale of the teen who learns to live adrift on the ocean with a beast capable of crushing most of a human's bones with one swipe of the paw occupies the rest of the book.  Martel weaves an utterly compelling and richly detailed tale of how one can survive not only the harsh cruelty of the open sea, but also the savage wildness of a primeval carnivore.<br />Be forewarned: this book is unflinching in its portrayal of survival, harkening back to adventure novels of long ago that young men would devour page after page late into the night with a flashlight under the sheets.  The squeamish should look for other reading material, as the day to day of Pi's fight to live is horrific.  Martel glimpses life at its rawest, but in those very depths delivers a page-turner that is expertly told.<br />And ultimately, \\"Life of Pi\\" is about the telling.  It's about how stories transcend the mundane and lift us to truth, be it lofty, spiritual truth or the truth of making it through just one more day.<br />Sadly, this is where Martel's creation stumbles.  Pi's spiritual quest that prefaces the shipwreck becomes not so much a desire to know God, but a love affair with stories.  Yet how can mere stories bring salvation and transcendence unless they are rooted in truth?  The ending of the book casts serious doubt on not only the nature of truth, but also the meaning of story.<br />At one point in the novel a character states that Pi's story can make you believe in God, but if we are to believe (or disbelieve) the tale of the young man, the tiger, and the sea, we are left to surmise that God is merely what we fabricate within us: a gauzy, white veil over a grim reality.  By extension, if we have invented God, then truth is only what we subjectively create.  For a book of this kind, it is a moral that consumes itself.<br />So Martel's book concludes with disturbing questions (for those who search for profundity hardenough), virtually ensuring it to be a favorite among juries that award prizes to books.  For the rest of us it is simply best to be lost in the story and appreciate whatever sections can be most appreciated, for in the end the sum of \\"Life of Pi\\" is less than the whole of its exceptionally well-crafted parts.enough), virtually ensuring it to be a favorite among juries that award prizes to books.

Incorporating a whimsical approach to teaching the alphabet, John Archambault's and Lois Ehlert's cacophony of color and text, \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,\\" could be the perfect book for toddlers. We started reading this to our son when he was just an infant, and to our surprise he was able to recite his entire alphabet by the time he was eighteen months old. The credit, in part, must go to this clever book.<br />The daring, lowercase \\"a\\" takes it upon himself to clamber up a lowly palm tree, calling out to the rest of the little letters to join him in the adventure. Unable to resist, the whole alphabet finds itself up in the now perilously bent tree. But soon- \\"Oh no! Chicka, chicka, BOOM, BOOM!\\" - chaos ensues as all find themselves in a heap on the ground, calling out to their uppercase parents, aunts, and uncles who soon arrive to help. Scrapes are soothed, tears are wiped, and the little letters eventually leave the scene of the disaster. That is until the moon shines bright and \\"a\\" repeats his taunt.<br />Told in bright colors, with big, round shapes and letters, this tale is a feast for the eyes. Author Archambault rhymes his tale, making it easy to remember (our son reads along with us on this book, unable to resist the lilting text.) The feel of the story makes it seem almost like an African parable, heavy on rhythm and sound, with memorable lines that stick with you and your child long after the cover is closed.<br />One of the finest children's book ever written, \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" should be a part of any young child's library. It's a story one can never tire of reading.	2003-05-28

Despite the beast of him, he has taught himself to speak and operate in a human world, having struck an unmentioned bargain with the hero who threatened to destroy him in his labyrinthine prison. Still, his bovine nature has relegated him to a sub-life as he struggles to rise to any level, time only diminishing the very traits that made him famous.<br />Even the mundane holds promise for a creature that doesn't ask for much, and time has taught him at least one thing: when the opportunity arises, take it.

Not since Wilbur of \\"Charlotte's Web\\" fame was labeled \\"Some Pig\\" have we seen a porcine protagonist as endearing as Olivia. This self-assured swine knows she's different than the rest of the sty and lives her uniqueness.<br />In \\"Olivia Saves the Circus\\", our heroine is confronted with the dreaded task of sharing her summer vacation with her class. Not content to live in reality, she fabricates a story in which she saves the day by taking on the roles of the trapeze artist, tattooed lady, and \\"Queen of the Trampoline\\" when the regular circus performers are done in by that scourge of children, ear infections. And despite her incredulous teacher, Olivia has the confidence to stick with her story. Does she realize it's an embellishment, if not a complete fraud? Well, yeah, but that's Olivia. If she believes it, it's real.<br />Ian Falconer has created a totally unique character in Olivia that also pays homage to previous literary little girls of the headstrong variety. She has sense of style outside the realms of reality (witness the Eleanor Roosevelt poster on her wall), but it's one that will appeal to both adults and children.<br />If there is any hesitation here (enough for the loss of a star) it's that usually dreamers like Olivia get some sort of comeuppance that helps them learn, but also allows them to stay dreamers. Instead, Olivia always manages to get a pass on correction. It's the world that is out of step, not her. Some might question how good a message that is to send to young children, while others might feel that cultivating a sense of the eccentric is needed for allowing children to explore their own personalities.<br />Still, no matter what you think, Olivia is here to stay and should prove to be a classic character.	2003-04-24

Along the way he is confronted by a little girl and animals that question the fact he appears to have no place to go. But this headstrong hare knows better, rebuffing all who question his seemingly purposeless state. His singlemindedness is a good message for children.<br />While the story itself is good, it is the luminous illustrations that elevate this book beyond the horde of mundane children's fare out there in the marketplace. McCarty's monochromatic drawings look remarkably like infrared photographs - everything seems to glow with life. The softness in the illustrations makes them seem as if they floated out of a lush dream. And that little bunny is just as cute as cute gets, too.<br />Endearing and beautiful.

As part of a series from Writers's Digest, this book covers the critical component of any novel: writing encounters, chapters, and scenes that have the ability to grip the reader and keep them turning pages.<br />Though the book is trade paper sized and only 211 pages, it is simply jammed with helpful ideas. Each chapter covers an essential aspect of writing scenes expertly. There is information on:<br />* Beginning a Scene<br />* Length<br />* Point of View<br />* Setting<br />* Ending a Scene<br />* Character, Plot, &amp; Theme Development<br />* Writing the Payoff<br />* Character Meetings<br />* Finales<br />* Structure<br />* Revising<br />Plus there are chapters that discuss how to write genre-specific scenes (sci-fi, romance, etc.) that are also compelling.<br />A typical chapter within the book starts with quotes from others on the art of writing. Obstfeld then lays out general concepts and cites examples from novels and movies that support his chapter topic. Excerpts from several award-winning novels raises the quality of the book as it lets beginning writers see how the &quot;pros&quot; do it. Some chapters include workbook-like assignments to help readers flesh out their scenes.<br />While all the chapters are developed well, the one covering character, plot, and theme development is particularly enlightening. The author elects to write an encounter scene with an emphasis on each aspect. It is amazing to see how a scene can change as it is written to the characters rather than plot and vice versa.<br />Obstfeld has taught writing professionally in addition to having published more than two dozen novels and it shows in his style. He can quickly and directly address a topic and elucidate it easily.

Birders of all kinds celebrate when a new guide becomes available, but most of us were taken aback by the comprehensive guide we found in Sibley.<br />I've been birding for more than twenty-five years, so I've built up quite a collection of guides. Sibley has become my new favorite, incorporating the best of the rest.<br />The layout of the book features an introductory section that discusses bird classification, range explanations, discussions of species variation,taxonomy, and songs/calls. Then the book follows the order of bird groups that were found in the original Peterson guides, explaining each group and its individuals.<br />An average page will include:<br />* A genus breakdown featuring one or two species with info<br />* Weights, lengths, and wingspreads<br />* A brief description with taxonomy to note<br />* Flight paintings (wings up, wings down)<br />* A minimum of three side paintings: usually juvenile, adult female, and adult male<br />* Picture pointers for features of note<br />* A vocal description<br />* Maps of range with season distinctions and rare sighting pinpoints<br />This is similar to many other field guides, but there are features of &quot;Sibley&quot; that are unique:<br />* The sheer breadth of coloration, hybrid, and regional variations in the paintings is extraordinary. This greatly aids in resolving issues where the bird on hand doesn't look exactly like more simplistic guides' illustrations. In other words, if the variant isn't listed for a certain bird here, it doesn't exist!<br />* Though essentially a paperback, it has a reinforced binding and flexible plasticized cover that give the book the durability expected of a guide while avoiding the more rigid covers that sometimes twist in a backpack and cause the spine to break. Thick pages resist bending and tearing.<br />* Clean layout. Despite the sheer amount of info on a given page, it is easy on the eyes and cleanly-associated with a specific bird. You won't mix up what you are reading or looking at.<br />* The size of the illustrations enables detail to come through (but see below.)<br />* Very current. Allows for migrants and released birds not found in other guides.<br />* Includes a pictorial overview of groups so a user can see a comparison of birds within a like group.<br />There are so many good things to say about this guide, but there are a few detractions. The biggest (pun intended) concerns the size, which is fifty percent larger than your average guide. This makes it unwieldy when compared with some other guides on the market. As a result, it is far heavier, too. It lacks a checklist format in the index for keeping a &quot;life list&quot; of birds seen. Lastly, it is a bit short on behaviors that might aid in identification. I suppose these were kept for the companion Sibley guide covering bird behavior, also an excellent book.<br />I still consider the old &quot;Golden Guide&quot; with illustrations by Arthur Singer to be the best true field guide (because of its combination of excellent graphics and small size), but as a more comprehensive work, nothing beats Sibley. Any serious birder must have this book.<br />Happy birding!Despite the sheer amount of info on a given page, it is easy on the eyes and cleanly-associated with a specific bird.

Part biography, part clarion call to a sleeping Church, it shares more with the Welsh Revival at the dawn of the 20th Century than it does with any modern church tome occupying the Christian bestseller list today.<br />Cymbala traces the history of his church, The Brooklyn Tabernacle, from a down-and-out, nearly dead meatlocker of a church where the &quot;frozen chosen&quot; simply waited for the inevitable closing to a vibrant powerhouse that is packed out every weekend for multiple services. This first half of the book outlines the basic struggle Cymbala and his wife faced as they sought God and cried out for Him to work a miracle in their perishing parish.<br />This first section of the book reads like any pastoral biography: filled with inspiration, miraculous occurances, and hankie-grabbing stories of prodigals restored and lives touched. Despite being soul-stirring, this is not the part of the book that grabbed me.<br />About halfway through, the book changes entirely in tone. The authors shift the emphasis to what is happening in churches across the world. At this point the message becomes more pastoral and enlightening.<br />The message that prayer should be the backbone of the Christian life comes through as Cymbala calls the Church to reevaluate its focus. The fallacies of chasing after church growth and the current trends are pointed out with alarm. It is here that the book picks up power and focus. Cymbala blasts church leaders for forgetting their first love, Christ, amid all the trappings of modern, cultural Christianity. It's not about marketing techniques or clever theologies, but about wholehearted devotion to the Lord of the Universe. The authors' heart for true revival comes through like a laser and is just like the fresh wind and fresh fire of the title.<br />Along the way, Cymbala is not afraid to step on toes. His is a radical revisioning of discipleship, yet has its feet firmly planted on the backs of those associated with the Welsh Revival and its &quot;children&quot;. You'll see several references to spiritual greats like Leonard Ravenhill and Duncan Campbell sprinkled through the text - a pleasure for me for certain. Cymbala's unrelenting pleas for sanity to be restored along with a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit rings true in the hearts of those who can accept what he has to say. We need humility, uncompromising faith and commitment to Christ, and a mightiness of spiritual power born of hours on our faces before God, allowing Him to make us the spiritual change agents He so desperately wants us to be.<br />If I didn't know better I'd say that this book was written in the 1950's at about the same time Ravenhill was writing &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot;. It carries the same forcefulness of message. And it is a message we desperately need today as the church finds itself far too ensnared by sentimental Christianity and the pop culture around us.<br />This book would have warranted five stars if it were not such a hydra. It's really two books in one. Being as small as it is - 185 pages in a trade paperback size, though a hardback - there should have been enough here for two good sized books. While I understand that the biographical section does illustrate the points the authors make later, it still feels as if one book starts and another stops part way through the book.<br />Still, two really good books in one may be perceived by some to be a blessing. And no matter how you look at &quot;Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire&quot; it is just that; a great addition to any Christian library.yet has its feet firmly planted on the backs of those associated with the Welsh Revival and its &quot;children&quot;.

In terms of Christian books that usually says good things about the quality of the work.<br />Billed as &quot;A Manual for Disciples&quot;, this workbook is a very thorough examination of all aspects and disciplines of the Christian life. Its nearly three hundred page length attests to the breadth of material that is covered. Topics such as knowing God, prayer, the Bible, The Holy Spirit, Christ, testing of one's faith, and evangelism make up just a few of the areas covered.<br />Each chapter follows a topical study that has a short passage of the Bible to read with a question or two afterward about the passage. There are sidebars that explain some concepts as well as stories by Christian figures. Opportunities are presented for journaling and Scripture memory.<br />The sidebars are especially enlightening and cull from some of the greatest Christian writers and preachers. The assemblage of thought here is splendid. You hear from the likes of Leonard Ravenhill, Billy Sunday, D.L. Moody, R.A.Torrey, J.I. Packer, Charles Spurgeon, Vance Havner, George MacDonald, and others. That list should give you a feel for where this manual is coming from doctrinally. Frankly, I think it is superb in this regard.<br />It is also worthy to note that this workbook is absolutely filled with superb engravings from artists such as Gustav Dore. The illustrations give the book a serious feel and help to highlight the profundity of the material covered. Never have I seen a book of this type so well illustrated. A delight for the eyes as well as the soul!<br />If I have any problems with the material it is that it has a tendency to ask questions that require only simple responses. While there are many thought-provoking questions and sections, a few don't really delve that deeply. If you intend to use this as a guide for a group, take time to unpack some of the questions a bit more for best results.<br />Let me end this review by saying that I've used this workbook with new Christians and it has brought excellent results. You would not go wrong in considering it for your discipleship materials.ew by saying that I've used this workbook with new Christians and it has brought excellent results.

What \\"The Story of Painting\\" brings to the reader is a very approachable style of writing and some of the most lush artwork you will see in any book on this subject. I was particularly surprised to see many works that I had never seen in any other book of this kind. Some were a revelation  (like Tintorretto's \\"The Last Supper\\"), while others allowed - via the detailed closeups featured in the book - a closer inspection of brushstrokes and technique not normally covered in other historical painting overviews.<br />\\"The Story of Painting\\" begins with short section covering works before the medieval era, mostly Greek, Roman, and Etruscan, then kicks into high gear before ending with the 20th Century. This concluding section is one of the weaker parts of the book, but I think it can be argued that the latter half of that time period has not produced many of the glorious works featured in other parts of the book. Too much time deconstructing art and not enough making soul-stirring paintings, I suppose.<br />As with any Sister Wendy art book, you get the sage, grandmotherly insights into the works from a woman who deeply enjoys art. Other books impart a barrier between the works, the critical evaluation of them by the author, and the reader. Sister Wendy smashes that piece of artifice and seeks to draw people into the works themselves, not to critique them and simply move on to the next, but to give life to each work. She does this admirably, in my opinion. From time to time she does take more time to dissect a piece and look at it elements apart from the work as a whole, and in each evaluation she lends her knowledge of iconography and symbolism to help the reader fully understand the painter's intent. Very helpful. When compared with other art books, it becomes even more rare as it also might be one of the few books of its kind that would work well as a primer for parents sitting down with children to examine the works together.<br />Lastly, the book itself is classic Dorling Kindersley: bright, white, glossy paper; easy to read, well-spaced typesetting; beautiful and large illustrations; helpful sidebars; and just an overall feel of quality. It's quite hard to find fault with the book. And as an expanded version of the original, it works faultlessly. This hefty tome practically defines the phrase \\"coffee table book\\". At 736 pages in length, its sheer heft would make it a fine weapon against your least favorite sneering, art critic!<br />Highly recommended.the painter's intent. Very helpful.

Not being the thickest tome doesn't help the cause.<br />But what a surprise this pleasant little book is!<br />In a sea of writers' helps, this one carves a niche by not only being surprisingly comprehensive in the breadth of topics it addresses, but also densely packed with useful tips. And did I mention that it is also breezily written, so it is not a chore to wade through? Kudos to Scott Edelstein for writing such a fine book to help writers, while also simultaneously proving that it is possible to know the writing profession inside and out and STILL actually write well!<br />This book contains plenty of the typical writer's advice like getting through writer's block, fostering creativity, and such, but also discusses the spiritual aspects of writing, common myths of the profession, and even technical advice. Each of the one hundred tips of the trade runs little more than a couple pages (with major exceptions being a few of the glossary tips), so this is a book that can digested in spurts. Read a bit, put it down for a while, and then read some more later.<br />What makes this book, though,  is Edelstein's welcoming writing style. Within a few pages, you feel like you know him and vice versa. He's the mentor all of us need.<br />Much more than expected. A worthy addition to your writing library.	2003-02-12

Sadly, despite the fact that this is a well-made, (and as the very title indicates) exhaustive concordance of the New International Version of the Bibe, this type of resource no longer fulfills its role to the extent that other resources can.<br />For instance:<br />* Websites exist that allow you full access to the NIV version, providing multiple keyword searches that this sort of reference simply cannot provide. Nothing beats a computer for searching for string matches. Cost? Free.<br />* Bible study software exists that fulfills the same keyword searches and can, in many cases, offer multiple translations with keyword searches across all versions. The better Bible software packages include commentaries, multiple translations, links to Strong's concordance, Hebrew and Greek lexical aids, Bible dictionaries, and so on. For the cost of this NIV concordance, you can purchase a decent piece of Bible software that offers more capability than the paper concordance does. Some of the best Bible software is even free.<br />* Text versions of the Bible exist for download online (though I am not certain of the NIV's availability.) When used with a word processor, you can search for words, too (though most word processing software does not allow searches on multiple words at once.) Still, this is another possibility.<br />But if you must have a bound concordance for the NIV, this is it folks. It has several plusses going for it to counter the format minuses above:<br />* Strong, plasticized, hard cover. Should last for a long time.<br />* Very easy to read sans-serif word heading typeface along with a nice, open serif typeface for the verse listings set on bright white pages. No eyestrain here.<br />* Excellent Strong's Concordance cross-reference.<br />* Detailed Hebrew and Greek dictionarys/lexicons.<br />It's everything you could want in one bound volume.

US	49110251	RR11WW5UNMOKQ	1576736741	26110350	Night Light: A Devotional for Couples	Books	2	176	230	N	N	Merely fair...	Sometimes I wonder if I read the same books that others rate as five stars. I personally think that five stars are too frequently given, particularly when we consider that the vast majority of books are simply average.<br />I was hopeful that \\"Night Light\\" would be above run-of-the-mill, but it really isn't. It's a fair book, but nothing else. (And please note that I am not a \\"Focus on the Family\\" basher. I think that ministry has helped bring many important topics to the fore. As a born-again Christian, I take seriously all the issues raised by that ministry and this book.)<br />Billed as being a unique daily devotional for Christian couples, it covers six months with each day comprised of a Bible verse, the Dobsons' thoughts about the verse as it relates to married couples' lives, a few questions to share together, and a closing prayer. Pretty standard fare for a devotional.<br />We've found the book to be written for couples that have extremely traditional marriage roles, but a growing number of couples (who are, by all means, traditional evangelical Christians) do not fit that mold. Generalizations about what the sexes are like in this book, unfortunately, are sadly stereotypical, too. Here, the Dobsons come across as stuck in another era. Now I am all for conserving the things that are great about America, Christianity, and family, but the authors seem to be writing more for their contemporaries, couples that have paralleled their own marriage experience. In short, if you don't match the Dobsons point for point in your marriage situation, the differences become glaring, becoming a focal point for incomplete application of their ideas.<br />Frankly, we've had quibbles with some of the theology, too. The book starts with an exposition of the old \\"I'm Third\\" idea - God first, others second, self third. We're not convinced this is biblical. Certainly God first is true, but doesn't Jesus say to \\"Love our neighbor as ourself\\" rather than to \\"Love our neighbor more than ourself\\"? It's obvious that deference to another's needs is key to any marriage, but it is all too frequent to find the balance tipping in one direction more than another. This can easily leave one spouse coming up short under the Dobsons' ideology. A godly husband needs to love his wife AND love himself in equal measure, and likewise the wife needs the same perspective from her point of view.<br />The questions asked during the devotional are many times pointless or do not provide any ideas for followup. In the section on prayer, for example, it is asked \\"Do you sometimes feel that the Lord is not listening when you pray?\\" Suppose that one or both answers that affirmatively. Then what? The Dobsons provide no help here except to get you to move on to the next question (which, in this case, has nothing to do with that previous question.) As a Christian Educator myself, I find that particularly galling. Examples like this abound in the book. And there are also plenty of leading questions that if answered in a fashion not in keeping with the authors' leading guide the users into a dead-end. The questions need to be better thought out. Adding helps for couples who disagree on some points is something I would also consider essential, but is sorely missing.<br />While any spiritual help in today's world is helpful, \\"Night Light\\" seems geared a bit low. If you've been Christians for any length of time, you probably have seen large swatches of everything here before. Because of this, after a while you start approaching the day's devotional dutifully rather than with any expectation. Too many books for couples suffer from this (so \\"Night Life\\" isn't that extraordinary in this regard.) They seem as if they were written for couples that have never talked about anything important during their entire marriage. Are couples this bad off? At times after reading some blatantly obvious point the authors expressed as some new revelation, my wife and I just kind of gave each other alook as if to say, \\"Are they serious?\\" That usually spells doom for books of this kind.<br />In short, the book breaks no new ground, boasts a very limited viewpoint that doesn't work well for all couples, and is average all the way around.<br />But this is not to say \\"Night Light\\" has no value. It would probably work very well for newlyweds, couples that are new in their Christian walk, or for couples that have never read any marital improvement books. Otherwise, skip the devotional and simply spend more time in prayer together.look as if to say, \\"Are they serious?\\" That usually spells doom for books of this kind.<br />In short, the book breaks no new ground, boasts a very limited viewpoint that doesn't work well for all couples, and is average all the way around.<br />But this is not to say \\"Night Light\\" has no value.

The author, Dallas Willard, does a very good job of capturing a topic that eludes many Christians: \\"What does it mean to truly live in the Kingdom of God?\\"<br />The primary source of Willard's theology is the Sermon on the Mount. By examining this sermon of Jesus' in light of Jesus' own perspective of the Kingdom of Heaven, Willard posits a fresh thinking about Jesus' commands and His reasoning behind the carefully chosen words of the Sermon, particularly The Beatitudes.<br />The conclusion of this examination is not so much that Jesus is adding to the expansive set of Mosaic laws, but that the Lord is merely showing how a person who dwells in the Kingdom of God acts and believes. Legalism brings no life, in short, and Jesus already knew that. He is instead saying that as we come to live more in God's Kingdom and less in the world's corrupted kingdom, what we see in the Sermon is how our lives will be.<br />The exegesis of the passages Willard covers is not traditional by any means, but as he develops his ideas and looks at them within the context of the Kingdom, his explanations make perfect sense. For instance, \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven\\" does not mean that we need to become spiritually bankrupt in order to get into Heaven. Willard instead turns this around and says that Jesus is telling those who are already in that state of bankruptcy that now the Kingdom of Heaven has come in Him, and for those that are willing to receive it, it can be theirs. This shift in perspective is then used to examine the rest of the Sermon.<br />Touching on all the major themes of Christian discipleship contained within Matthew chapters five through seven, \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" is very complete and would serve anyone who is trying to better understand some of the difficult statements of Jesus. Willard's continual reinforcement of Jesus' Kingdom ideals truly does force a shift in thinking and I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter their level of Christian maturity.<br />Are there sticking points? Yes - not everything works. Some of that may be the intractability of this reviewer, but perhaps not. The author's insistence that Matthew 7:7-8 (\\"Ask and it will be given....\\") applies not to prayer but to how we should conduct our interpersonal relationships with fellow humans falls flat. Also, the illustrations used in the book are usually well-suited for Willard's points, but occasionally they have unintended, secondary meanings that don't serve to help their cause.<br />And while this book is written well and simply, the ideas espoused here are not always easily grasped the first time around. You'll find yourself reading sections more than once in order to catch the subtlety of Willard's arguments. At four hundred pages in length, this is not a breezy, afternoon read, either.<br />My biggest complaint lies, though, not in Willard's words, but how they are set. I have excellent vision, but found the choice of type and its size to only compound the difficulties in reading this book. Even in its hardback form, the book's format is trade-sized, so you don't have many options. Willard liberally sprinkles the book with italicized text and the font used here has an italic format that further hindered my reading. Pages seemed to contain paragraphs that were scrunched or justified strangely, all due to italicized text. One of the slowest reading books I have ever seen.<br />Even if you don't buy into Willard's arguments, \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" is still a truly thought-provoking book that will challenge you to break out of your theological molds.

Chock full of astute observations about the utter lack of morality within American popular culture and the creeping destruction of Christianity caused by compromises with that culture, this book is a clarion call to intelligent people who understand that only through the death of self and utter submission to the God of the Christian Bible can the we hold out hope for the future.<br />Prophetic in its intensity (though similar arguments were voiced by Francis Schaeffer long before Wells), \\"Losing Our Virtue\\" discusses how the combination of deconstructionist theology and psychology at the nascence of the 20th century brought us to the point that we call black white and white black. He outlines the rise of self at the expense of traditional Christian views of God, sin, and the cross of Christ, showing how modern culture now exists in a moral vacuum that has in its brazenness supposedly killed God and therefore any guilt that may arise from acknowledging that He transcends us. With self now ensconced as the moral center, absolute truth and morality are jettisoned in favor of each person being his own moral center. That this can only breed relativism and the eventual destruction of all things moral, is a point well covered in the book.<br />In some ways, perhaps too well covered. The first few chapters and the last chapter are brilliant. At the cost of a star, though, the middle sags as Wells builds his arguments. The problem lies in beating the points along his path to his conclusion to death. This book probably could have been cut down to 120 pages and would have made its point more efficiently. Metaphorically, you can kill the vampire with an effective stake through the heart. You don't have to then stuff it with garlic, douse it in \\"holy water\\", and bury it in a silver coffin lined with crucifixes under a running stream.<br />The section on the differences between \\"Guilt\\" and \\"Shame\\" was also confusing since Wells mixed conflicting viewpoints and counterpoints together, making it hard to tell exactly what his point was until the very end of the section. Again, a bit better editing would have made the book a smoother read.<br />This is an intellectually challenging book that demands close attention. And despite the author's attempt to end on a more upbeat note, it is hard to close this book and think any other outcome than the utter corruption of the entire world and most of Christendom is a foregone conclusion. Hopefully, readers will come away with a burning desire to make a difference rather than conceding that all is lost.ilt\\" and \\"Shame\\" was also confusing since Wells mixed conflicting viewpoints and counterpoints together, making it hard to tell exactly what his point was until the very end of the section.

As with any book that looks at a highly charged issue, it is important to come to it with an open mind. That many reviewers here on both sides of the issue cannot keep from vehemently pointing fingers at each other says nothing about the actual content of \\"In Six Days\\", unfortunately, so I hope this review can find some middle ground. Rather than making this review simply another in a line of rabid apologetics for one side or the other, I hope to relate whether the book succeeds in accomplishing what it intends.<br />To create this book, many Christian scientists (of various disciplines) from around the world were asked \\"Why do you believe in a literal six-day biblical creation as the origin of life on earth?\\" The fifty best responses ultimately were included.<br />Sadly, this format makes \\"In Six Days\\" less than useful - on any level. The answers provided resemble testimonies rather than useful scientific analyses. Respondents tended to repeat each other, answer too generally, or (conversely) too technically on a single point. Further compounding the problems of the book, the great majority of the scientists refer to points outside their own discipline. If I were looking for serious answers to important questions about a six-day creation, would I want to read a mechanical engineer's musings on organic chemistry? Probably not. This book would be infinitely more helpful if the question had been posed as \\"What are five discoveries within your field of expertise that point specifically to a six-day creation?\\" But as phrased here, the original question automatically leads to unfocused answers.<br />In truth, only about twenty of the respondents provide compelling arguments. Of those twenty, half spoke about ideas outside their disciplines. That doesn't leave the reader with much unimpeachable \\"ammunition\\" to counter evolutionists.<br />This is not to say that nothing here satisfies. Twenty percent of the respondents had compelling information that either casts doubt on treasured pro-evolution precepts or supports a God-inspired young earth. Unfortunately, for those that have some passing knowledge of the Creation vs. Evolution hysteria, few of those ten scientists had anything new to contribute to the body of work out there already in the pro-creation community. For this reason, it must be assumed that this book is intended for people who have never explored the claims of creationists. Given some of the issues already mentioned, the result is less than stellar.<br />And this is a shame since there are many excellent books that make strong arguments for the creation viewpoint. Several of the scientists quoted in \\"In Six Days\\" refer to these books. My question is then: \\"Why not skip 'In Six Days' and just read those more scholarly and better-constructed books?\\" One book, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", was mentioned repeatedly - it's probably a good bet.<br />If you have some knowledge of the debate, pass on this book. If you know someone who is asking questions and doesn't have a tremendously technical bent, \\"In Six Days\\" might work for them in spots. Otherwise, there are increasingly more pro-creation, young earth, and intelligent design books out there that offer the reader a better use of their time.s not to say that nothing here satisfies.

The  Christian unschooling movement adopts this same thinking, but with a view toward the Holy Spirit, rather than natural law, as the guide behind each child's education.<br />On the surface, this rather Zen-like idea that \\"the curriculum is that there is no curriculum\\" appears so obvious as to warrant a self-inflicted slap to the forehead (and the parental anecdotes included in the book universally describe that slap in detail.) Letting a child primarily learn what sparks his imagination seems like a breakthrough in this context. But again, the idea isn't new or revolutionary. Modern versions of this philosophy - as espoused by the likes of Ralph Tyler and John Holt - tend to fall more naturally into the Christian viewpoint than Rousseau's, but the genesis of the ideas are the same. (If most Christian unschoolers knew of Rousseau's lifestyle, there might be a bit more introspection concerning the use of his theories - and ultimately their source - I suspect.)<br />But there are serious deficiencies to examine here. The problem with any book such as this is that it is in love with its own premise. However, though truth is usually found somewhere in the middle, \\"Christian Unschooling\\" is clearly mired in one end of the spectrum of educational thought. On the other hand, books in the other camp (such as \\"The Well-Trained Mind\\") cling to the more behavioral (B.F. Skinner) approach of \\"drill, drill, drill, rote, rote, rote\\" that has been traditionally predominant in Christian homeschools, certainly to the detriment of those children as well.<br />What is needed is a proper synthesis. Surely children need to be encouraged to find avenues for learning that appeal to them and come naturally, but this must be tempered by continuously providing experiences far outside their comfort zone and limited scope. And certain knowledge may be desirable to have even if it does not come by self-exploration. Sometimes we must knuckle down and learn things we don't immediately want to know.<br />Take, for instance, a case appropriate for the Christian audience. A child might love the great heroes of the Bible, earnestly researching their lives and tales, while at the same time showing no desire to ever understand or pursue doctrinal knowledge. Certainly no parent would want that to continue. The hole in the unschooling model is that there are few ways of remedying this lack without moving outside of unschooling. Therefore, as a philosophy unto itself, it fails. Other examples that find the chinks in the armor abound.<br />Now in the case of this book, the authors earnestly quote Scriptures to prove their philosophy is correct. Unfortunately, they ignore as many or more verses that cramp their theories. This is disingenuous on the part of the authors. The truth is, as mentioned previously, more broad than one educational philosophy. It is necessary to incorporate a wide-ranging scope of education ideas when homeschooling. Unschooling is only one color in the rainbow of ideas.<br />As for the actual content of the book, it is far too anecdotal to be helpful as a reference tool for building an unschooling program. Large sections of the book consist of \\"Me, Too!\\" stories by parents who have jumped on the Christian unschooling bandwagon. This seems to fly in the face of the author's own advice to parents to find their own way in all teaching. If no example is appropriate, then why include any? In short, the entire middle of the book only functions as a cheerleading device. That the authors feel put upon by other Christian homeschoolers who look down upon unschooling, only adds to the need to pad the book with supporters.<br />This is not to say that the book has no merit. As a counter to other forms of education, it is good that someone espouses this philosophy so that parents can make informed choices. Unschooling does have appeal in that it tries to make learning more practical, applicable, and fun. Who could fault that? And while the majority of the book has truly little to add to the topic of unschooling, the appendices in the back contain lists of useful resources.<br />An important philosophy and possibly one of the few Christian unschooling books out there, but on the whole, not a great book.<br />(One final note: As homeschooling comes under increasing fire by professional educators and bureaucrats- witness the trends in states like California - unschooling will become increasingly harder to justify to state governments. As a person who supports homeschoolers of all philosophies, my warning is to think hard about unschooling since it may be the first philosophy to wither under proposed new homeschooling standards.)ice to parents to find their own way in all teaching.

US	49110251	R3QULZKPIHPE29	155832142X	845893185	Smart Love: The Compassionate Alternative to Discipline That Will Make You a Better Parent and Your Child a Better Person	Books	2	49	84	N	N	How to raise self-centered, postmodern children	Raising your children to be the people you hope for them to be is every parent's challenge. As our society continues to model and promote obnoxious or downright evil behavior as the norm, parents need all the help they can get. Since Dr. Spock first published his child rearing book, eager parents routinely look to books for help in raising their kids. \\"Smart Love\\" claims to ride in on a white horse to save our children.<br />Sadly, the book can provide little wisdom to today's parents.<br />William J. Pieper and Martha Heineman Pieper, the married authors of the book, have a clinical psychology practice in which they claim to have used a few simple techniques to help children reach their potential. The book itself, though almost three hundred pages in length, sticks to a fairly basic formula: Children are born desiring happiness, therefore maximizing children's happiness is the primary role of parents. The worst thing a child can be is unhappy. Repeated unhappy incidents lead to a state of being rooted in unhappiness. From this defective state children will act out of their unhappiness unless the situation is remedied. In sidebar after sidebar they provide illustrations that attempt to prove their main point.<br />But the book is deeply flawed on so many counts that thinking people can find no applicable knowledge in its pages other than to simply love one's children.<br />Cases in point:<br />1) The Piepers routinely disparage several other methods of raising children, yet provide no empirical evidence for lambasting these supposedly defective or ineffective child rearing techniques.<br />2) Maintaining happiness in a child is the be all and end all of their method. And while no one would certainly wish to continually frustrate or hinder a child's happiness in the long run, is instilling perpetual happiness the sole objective of raising a child? Much evil has been done in the world by people seeking to maximize their own happiness. Should we be placing such a high standard on being happy as opposed to being moral or self-sacrificing? We have seen how a generation raised on maximizing fulfillment of personal happiness functions, and it is not pretty.<br />3) In lieu of this, it is not surprising that the primary methodology of \\"Smart Love\\" exists in a moral vacuum. This is no way to raise a child.<br />4) The flagrant antireligious perspective of this book is appalling, but not unexpected. The authors in several places in the book make sure that everyone knows that religion has played an overwhelming role in stunting children's growth by imposing systems that may not ultimately provide all the happiness a child deserves. And forbid it that any child should grow up in a household that clings to any belief system that challenges that people are ultimately good! This postmodern nose-thumbing at any viewpoint that smacks of restraining people from grabbing for anything that makes them happy, regardless of the spiritual implications of that desire, is typical of books of this type. That devout parents have raised many generations of children who grow up to be superior adults via concepts that are not fundamentally based on maximizing children's happiness all the time is completely disregarded. Competing worldviews need not apply, as the Piepers see it.<br />5) It is difficult to apply the book to everyday life. The authors give vague advice on how to generally apply their thinking to given situations. A quick cross-reference of their advice versus the sidebar life illustrations in which the knowledge is applied will leave many scratching their heads. Certainly, parents must be clever in dealing with their children, but I wonder where all the sidebars in which the techniques failed to resolve issues are. There are too many exceptions to the Piepers' \\"rules\\" to make this book beneficial to any but the few parents who are completely befuddled and have absolutely no control over their kids. Not surprisingly, the sidebar illustration inmost cases seem to feature such parents.<br />To their credit, the Piepers get a few things right - enough to salvage this book's rating from a lone star rating. They repeatedly nail the source of many children's true problem: lazy, self-centered, materialistic parents. The authors say that their practice has seen its share of unnecessary, two-income earners. Too many parents sacrifice their children's wellbeing on the altar of money. Families need to learn to live on less and keep a parent at home while the children are young. They also skewer the attitude that many parents have that it is possible to live life unchanged from its pre-child state. Sorry, but children are a privilege and not a right - you can't keep on partying or acting like you did before kids came along. And lastly, the Piepers nail the over-reliance placed on television as the ultimate panacea for harried parents. (In a curious case of \\"eating one's own offspring\\" this book was endorsed by the founder of The Children's Television Workshop.)<br />But in the long run, it is this reviewer's opinion that \\"Smart Love\\" contains too many flaws to be an effective aid in raising kids. Its worldview is profoundly limited and will ultimately lead to children who lack a grounding in anything else but looking out for number one.in most cases seem to feature such parents.<br />To their credit, the Piepers get a few things right - enough to salvage this book's rating from a lone star rating.

Mirthful with beautiful illustrations, this book would be perfect for any youngster under the age of seven. Audrey and Don Wood have collaborated on several award-winning books, and of the ones we've seen, &quot;Piggies&quot; is our favorite.<br />The story is simple. The child narrator discusses his/her five pairs of piggies (fingers, thumbs), assigning a temperament to each pair. The pairs go through several kinds of environments, changing with the environment. The ten little piggies cavort and act up according to the situation. In the end there is a bedtime coming together of the piggies.<br />That rather perfunctory summary does no justice to this charming book, especially since the illustrations by Don are spectacular.<br />And this is the main beef with this board book format of the story (and the sole reason for losing a star.) Several full-size versions of this book exist. At this larger size, the amazing detail of the little pigs emerges. But in the board book format, the illustrations get squeezed down, losing the details that bring out the personalities of the piggies.<br />This leads to a tough decision: go with the sturdier board book or with the regular hardback. Much depends on how hard your children treat books. Very small children would do better with the board book, while older children would be better off with a larger, less sturdy format.<br />Still, either way, this is an admirable addition to any young child's library and comes highly recommended.	2002-12-18

Not wishing to come off as \\"that know-it-all Greek guy\\" in the small group Bible studies I attended by toting in the Greek-only Aland, nor wanting to lug around more than one Bible, I was fortunate enough to stumble on this Greek interlinear.<br />I bought mine the year it was published and have used it constantly since then.<br />My impressions:<br />1) Exceptionally well-made, with a textbook-quality binding. It's amazing how well it has stood up under hard use.<br />2) For its size, which is small (5.75\\" x 8.25\\" x 1\\"), the type and layout are excellent - very easy on the eyes. And despite the 913 pages crammed into an inch thick volume, the pages are thick enough to prevent type bleed-through from becoming a distraction.<br />3) The Greek font used is one of the more beautiful I have seen and is a pleasure to read.<br />4) It is perfectly suited for use as a single source in small group Bible studies. It also is helpful from a perspective other than the Greek resource in this regard, as the New Revised Standard Version is unique enough to be a counter to all the NIV, KJV, and NASB sources out there while also avoiding being a paraphrase. People in your group will eventually realize that when the inevitable question, \\"What does the Greek say?\\" comes up, someone will have a decent answer if using this interlinear.<br />5) Certainly some Greek geek will have quibbles with the interlinear translation, but I've found it to be very serviceable. Let's be honest - don't most people use the Greek translation in an interlinear Bible as a crutch of sorts? I almost always find a word, tense, or slang phrase I'm not catching immediately and the Greek translation helps. Other references are always helpful when doing in-depth study, but on its own this interlinear stands up.<br />All in all, this is a very well-balanced Greek/NRSV interlinear that I would heartily endorse for anyone considering such a Bible.ll in all, this is a very well-balanced Greek/NRSV interlinear that I would heartily endorse for anyone considering such a Bible.	2002-12-09

Long the authors of the popular &quot;Tastings&quot; in the aforementioned newspaper, John and Dottie dispense what I can best call &quot;grandmotherly&quot; advice on wines - joyful, nonjudgmental, wise, and wonderfully helpful. They make wine newbies feel welcome, but provide enough down-home wisdom that even aficionados will come away satisfied.<br />What they bring to their column every Friday in the Journal translates to their latest book (an update of their 1999 version.) The same approachable writing style and sheer pleasure they so masterfully embue in their wine tastings follows in the book. And rarely do authors manage to pierce the literary plane and become real people, but John and Dottie come off in their book as those fun next-door neighbors every one of us has known at some time in our life.<br />The book could not be more simple in its layout. The authors discuss popular white grape varietals, then reds, and some other specific types of wines (like Sauternes, Champagne, etc.) Most chapters consist of a specific grape varietal discussion, recommended wines of that varietal, and a page or two of general wine tips. This pattern repeats throughout the book (with few exceptions) and covers about thirty grapes/types of wine.<br />This book is not meant to be encyclopedic in nature. John and Dottie simply ask you to come along and enjoy a glass of wine with them, dispensing simple, but usable advice on how to enjoy the trip. Some might downgrade the rating for being so simplistic, but a readthrough would dissuade this. Other references are available that cover the specifics missing from this book. But as the authors are more interested in evangelizing wine drinking - and specifically the mere enjoyment of wine in a stress-free setting - you won't (and don't) need to know the intricacies of French Bordeaux or the details of the difficulties of truly knowing what's in that bottle of Chilean red. (Consider Karen MacNeil's &quot;The Wine Bible&quot; in that case, particularly if you are new to wine.)<br />The only lack of the book is that it recycles some anecdotes from the &quot;Tastings&quot; columns, but this is more than made up for by the sheer joy John and Dottie bring to the subject of wine.<br />You can't go wrong with &quot;The Wall Street Journal Guide to Wine&quot;. It's truly about as escapist as a book on wine can be, while providing helpful wisdom that goes down as pleasingly as a chilled Oregon Pinot Gris on a sunny summer day.ils of the difficulties of truly knowing what's in that bottle of Chilean red.

My wife and I carefully handled it when reading to our son, but within a couple days the page bundles were separating from the binding in two spots. This has progressed at such a rate that the whole book is threatening to come apart.<br />This is inexcusable, particularly given the thickness of the book. If you make a collection like this that will be heavily used and will certainly be handled less than gingerly by children, you better make it strong. That ours got wonky while being read from by two responsible adults makes it worse. Shame on Houghton Mifflin for producing such a poorly made book!<br />We purchased \\"The Complete Adventures of Curious George\\" in the hopes of saving a few dollars over purchasing all seven of the included stories separately.

Sjogren's ideas as encapsulated in \\"Conspiracy of Kindness\\" involve reaching out to a community through acts of kindness. These simple acts allow people in the church who may never have witnessed to anyone before (via the Four Spiritual Laws, The Bridge or one of Evangelism Explosion's techniques) to impact others via guiltless, stressless, low-risk, high grace actions instead of words. God's love is shown to someone in a practical way. For the storeowner, a group might clean his toilets. A neighborhood might be canvassed with offers of free batteries for smoke alarms. Free car washes and even having the church pay for a large part of someone's gasoline bill at a fuel stop are other ways to reach people with the message that God loves them deeply. Cards explaining the reason for this gift are handed out along with the gift, and information about the church is included on the back of the card. No pressure is exerted, no money taken, and for those who are so moved by the gift, people are on hand to share the Gospel more completely.<br />In light of a recent George Barna survey that put evangelical Christians right below prostitutes in terms of credibility and public opinion, Sjogren's radical revisioning of how to evangelize also carries with it the opportunity for churches to makes amends for perceptions. As a member of Sjogren's church for many years, I've personally seen how effective these methods are. People sometimes break down weeping when someone hands them a free can of soda with no other expectation than the receiver be blessed by it. The church has grown at light speed as a result.<br />\\"Conspiracy of Kindness\\" addresses the depth of these ideas in a far greater way than any review can. The book examines the failures of modern evangelism, why this method is superior, it's biblical basis, the idea of scattering seed constantly, how to implement servant evangelism in a church, and how using these ideas can transform individuals and small groups in their ministries.<br />But \\"Conspiracy of Kindness\\" is not without issues.<br />The Bible states that the reason people came into the Church was not so much that the Church was kind to outsiders but that it was kind to insiders. It was the love that early Christians had for each other that caused the world to wonder. Sjogren states that how we \\"treat [the unchurched] is the litmus test of our spiritual health.\\" In fact, he has it reversed: everything starts in the House of God. If we do not sacrificially love our brethren, we cannot hope to ever reach outsiders.<br />Unfortunately, servant evangelism techniques can be adopted without a truly Christian message. Without a unique message, this method of evangelism is a hook with no meat on it. Other non-Christian religious organizations are adopting these methods and are using them to effectively bring in people in similar amounts. We have to be poised to offer Christ relentlessly or else we will end up looking no different from the others who are using these ideas but without Christ.<br />Servant evangelism by its very nature can appeal to a consumer mentality. It creates an expectation in people that Christ exists to fulfill one's wishes. That this mentality is becoming increasingly common in evangelical Christianity is to our shame, and even brings to question just what kind of salvation people may have come to. The literature given with servant evangelism gifts states the gift comes \\"with no strings attached\\". The truth is, if followed to its natural end, that gift is meant to help eventually bring someone to a point of dying to self and surrendering his or her whole being to Christ. Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote, \\"When Christ bids a man, He bids him come and die.\\" That's a pretty big string and becomes more so if avoided early on. Shouldn't we be setting this expectation immediately when we are doing servant evangelism?<br />Because so little is asked of people who participate in servant evangelism projects other than to show up, it tends to let people doing it off the hook theologically. The average person handing out a soda doesn't truly need to know how to communicate a Biblical pathway of salvation to someone who might ask. Certainly someone asking can be referred to a more knowledgeable person on the team, but shouldn't we be spending time with everyone showing them how to communicate the Gospel verbally? Faith does come from hearing the Word of God, does it not?<br />One key point of the book sounds like a Nike ad: \\"Just Do It\\". Sjogren calls this \\"Ready, Fire, Aim\\" - tune the outreach over time rather than simply keeping it stuck in a committee, always discussing, but never doing. Steve is right in saying that the biggest problem lies in even getting started, but the Bible clearly states that we must consider leaders and plans of action thoughtfully through the Spirit - and that takes time sometimes. Anything else becomes spiritually lazy and can cause situations where good people get \\"shot\\" accidentally because time was not taken to \\"aim\\" at the target.<br />As with any new idea that comes across the Body of Christ today we have a tendency to go rushing over to see how it works, abandoning whatever we were doing where we were. Still, if you are part of a church that has never tried servant evangelism, then by all means do so. But be very careful to make sure that you incorporate old evangelism techniques with the new. Work to overcome inherent weaknesses in this model. Find a way to think about other radical ways to not only reach the lost, but your own comrades in the pews.

In our day, relativism rules supreme, as every person feels their interpretation of reality is as valid as any other. Copan shows that it is difficult - if not impossible - to share Christ with those who have no desire to discuss Him on a level playing field of reason.<br />At the very heart of the book is the idea that there is absolute truth and that acknowledging this is essential for evangelization or any discussion that attempts to define &quot;Truth&quot;. This book helps point out the lack of reason behind relativistic arguments. Fallacious logic and suspect beliefs systems are dealt with by showing people how to use logic to punch holes in relativistic thinking without having to know vast sections of Scripture. By taking Copan's clear reasonings to their logical conclusions one can create common ground for the sharing of the Gospel, increasing the likelihood of success.<br />Copan also includes excellent and reasonable ways to counter many of the harder arguments that many will raise with common sticking points in theology. For example, there is an extended section that addresses the question of how a loving God can send people to Hell who have never had the chance to hear the Gospel. Other questions on this same order of difficulty are discussed, with well-reasoned responses that will help Christians deal with the tougher questions they are often asked by those investigating Christianity.<br />The author's angle on evangelizing those firmly in the relativistic camp is simple, intelligent, and true to the idea that being logical and rational is part of calling oneself a Christian. Not a lot of Scripture here, since that is not the author's point. Getting to a common ground by dismantling resistance to even discussing the Bible is.<br />I liked the angle of the debate here and the call for greater logical thinking for Christians. The main flaw comes from the overuse of certain tactics of logic when another method of reasoning could be used - at times Copan seems repetitive. Another issue is not the fault of the book, per se, since while it is very helpful, it must be used to supplement, rather than supplant, a full knowledge of Scripture. Arguing logically is surely a help, but without a good command of the Bible all evangelism will fail. Discussing points logically can never get one to salvation - the Bible makes this clear (&quot;Faith comes by hearing the word of God.&quot;)<br />So if you wish to have a logical approach to dealing with relativism and the difficult questions non-Christians ask, this is certainly an excellent source when used in conjunction with the Bible.ter logical thinking for Christians.

And while the former book has gathered more press, Elliot's is still as useful and has stood the test of time.<br />Having read some of the one and two star reviews here, I would simply say that virginity, making sure one's relationships are upright, asking serious questions about the worthiness of a potential mate, surrendering one's sexuality to God, dealing with loneliness, and knowing how to die to self daily are practices and beliefs that never go out of style.<br />Frankly, I believe this book has as much to offer as anything out there. That it is coming up on twenty years in the market does not diminish the power of the words contained inside. With the rampant promiscuity among young people, even those who claim the name of Christ, and the fallout that results in young lives because of a shattered soul given away in pieces to one sex partner after another, \\"Passion & Purity\\" still calls to all who will hear.<br />As for me, I heeded the words of the author as a young man and was able to hold on amidst the storm of sexual imagery and waning morality.

How could I trample on that price?<br />Let me also say that after reading this book, I wrote Elisabeth Elliot and she wrote me a very kind and thoughful reply. If there is anything anochronistic about the author and her views, I will take her position any time. I mean, when was the last time an author personally responded to a letter you wrote? It just doesn't happen anymore.<br />If you are struggling with your sexuality, your dating life, and your desires for marriage, by all means read \\"Passion & Purity\\". It helped me. It can help you, as well.	2002-11-22

And as the man is, so are his writings. If you can read this book and not be driven to your knees, even as you rend your clothing, then buddy you're dead already!<br />A condensation of &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot; into a few words would yield the truth that it's Man's fault alone. You see, God wants to pour out revival, to set all of us ablaze with the fire of His Spirit, but we are so oblivious to the truth that our hearts are totally turned away from Him that we cannot begin to acquire what He is so richly wanting to shower us with.<br />It starts with repentence - and not your mamby-pamby, watered-down 21st century style repentence, but the kind that tears a man or woman down to the soul, only to allow God to rebuild and reshape. Ravenhill argues that this is not something that happens overnight. If the Church wants revival, it's going to come with a cost. He proceeds to layout a compelling vision of that cost and the crucibles needed to hold what God will pour out.<br />No Christian library is complete without the works of Leonard Ravenhill, and the best place to start is with &quot;Why Revival Tarries&quot;. Get it today and be prepared for the glory that will come.	2002-11-21

Coben spins a story guaranteed to draw in even the most jaded thrill seeker.<br />Rather than simply rehash plot points, let me say that while the book is a great escape, it does have flaws worthy of downgrading its rating from a perfect score.<br />The first problem lies in what I call \\"The One Pager\\" - that mysterious character that appears briefly to tie all the strings together. It's a cheap writer's trick and beneath the rest of the book. I felt a bit cheated.<br />The second problem lies in the cliched stereotyping of politicians (always bad), businessmen (always bad), drug dealers (not only good, but with hearts of gold), and others. This lends an air of smug superiority that detracts from the rest of the novel.<br />The third problem may or may not be an issue for some, and that is the switches between voice. The main character speaks from his limited perspective, but then the next chapter is from an omniscient narrator's point of view. This alternating change of voice was definitely different, but felt odd in reading. Definitely the reader's call.<br />\\"Tell No One\\" may not win any literary awards, but for anyone seeking a good way to wile away the hours, it's a fine way to forget the rest of the world.	2002-11-21

As a quick overview of Christian doctrine (from a Reformed Theology perspective) there is no book like it that I have come across. And having once been the book buyer for a Christian bookstore, I've seen a truckload or two of books.<br />I have always liked R. C. Sproul's works. His &quot;The Holiness of God&quot; is the finest overview of that topic available. Sproul brings the same dedication to &quot;ETotCF&quot;, providing the reader with core theological points and the Scriptures to back them. As a quick reference it shines. For anyone starting in the faith or seeking a more broad grounding in doctrine, this is as good a place to start as any.<br />The very fact that so much is being covered in so few pages means that there is an automatic issue of depth. No topic is covered in its full theological glory. Entire volumes have been written on topics like faith and sin, so one cannot come to this work expecting mind-bending treatises or total analysis. Most of the hundred and two topics are only given two to three pages at most. This makes the &quot;Essential&quot; in the title true: only the essence exists here. But again, for what it seeks to accomplish, this book hits the bullseye.<br />If you are not familiar with Reformed Theology, it differs slightly from other schools of theological thought, but not in any way as to be questionable. Personally, I find Reformed thought to be the most solid of all the differing viewpoints. But as such, there will be some differences in the issues of grace, eschatology, methodologies of sanctification and justification, and ecclesiology. Charismatics/Pentacostals, for example, will find him at once sympathetic and antagonistic to many cherished doctrines. One must remember, though, as with all books on doctrinal issues, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. And more often than not, Sproul will be waiting for you at the middle ground.<br />One of those rare books that shoul occupy space in every Christian's bookshelves, I go back to it again and again. And when it comes down to it, what more could you want?rare books that shoul occupy space in every Christian's bookshelves, I go back to it again and again.

In this, his autobiography via his journals, we see the life this young man led and the preordained road that led him to gain what he could not lose.<br />&quot;The Journals of Jim Elliot&quot; had a profound effect on me as a young man as I happened to be at a similar stage in life as Elliot during most of the pages. What I found on those pages - the lifeblood of a man fully sold out to God - changed my life.<br />A long book, &quot;tJoJE&quot; calls anyone who wants to know how to live a committed Christian life throughout the slow unfolding of Elliot's life. As an encouragement to young men, it is peerless. Its only detraction is due to the very nature of the autobiographical style as derived from journal entries. While you see God's hand moving in Elliot's life, sometimes the nature of the entries is lost, slow-moving, or repetitive. Such is the style of the book.<br />However, what I found most helpful in reading this book is the stark contrast between Christian practice of fifty-plus years ago and today. Elliot was distinctly a man of his time, but he was not alone in his complete surrender to God. He was surrounded by many people who were like him. How he lived, thought, and died seems foreign to today's Christians. In fact, he shares more with a Christian of two hundred years ago in David Brainerd than anyone you typically find in a pew today. His example is so profound that it is hard not to feel that something has changed in the last couple decades. Somewhere there are men like Jim Elliot today; I hope I can find them and learn from their examples, as well.<br />Anyone who stays with &quot;The Journals of Jim Elliot&quot; will find a great reward in its pages. It has always been one of my favorite Christian books.

His light approach and expert analysis of all aspects of the wine world are a reassuring voice amid the din of conflicting advice out there in the wine racks.<br />Zraly, well-known for his superior knowledge in matching wine with food, keeps his book informative, but not overwhelming. The book is written in a breezy and easily read format, with plenty of white space on each page to keep the text, sidebars, margin info, and graphics from overwhelming the reader. And for those who like to know interesting facts about wine, each page has tidbits written in the margins that when dropped correctly during your next wine tasting will bring out the &quot;Oohs&quot; and &quot;Aahs&quot; in the guests.<br />The only negative to the book is that it can't have it all ways. It is clearly a beginner to intermediate book, and while it is derived from the class in wine that Zraly actually teaches around the country, it lacks the ability to serve as a comprehensive reference. For this reason, I would team this book with Karen MacNeil's &quot;The Wine Bible&quot; - a very comprehensive, yet still easy to understand resource.	2002-11-20

It reads easily, for the most part, and never insults the reader. The author joins the &quot;all things are possible&quot; attitude, leaving the appreciation of wine to the reader, while providing guideposts for enjoyment. Never is the reader talked down to, but neither is the author willing to keep his advice on a lowest common denominator level.<br />This book has an insider's information and I found some of the restaurant and background info on par with Boudrain's &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot;, but with a dash more restraint. I'm not sure if the wine industry has the kind of dirt that Boudrain exposes, but the novelistic style of Delissio's book still makes it a worthy read.<br />Where this primer fails is not so much the fault of the book, but rather in its competition. Zraly's wine course book and MacNeil's &quot;The Wine Bible&quot; are superior. The Zraly book is very basic, while MacNeil's is far more thorough. One reviewer noted how well Delissio clarified the wines of France, but I found his tour to be more confusing than similar discussions in the other two books. The sidenotes and fun facts in Zraly, and the ebullient, &quot;zest for life&quot; attitude of MacNeil also take them one step above &quot;The River Cafe Wine Primer&quot;.<br />Another significant lack is that due to the writing style and the book's layout, it doesn't function well as a reference. In other words, it wouldn't be a book I would reach for if I had a question. Delissio avoids naming names - his wine recommendations are more generalized. This works well for a book that will probably not go through several revisions, but again, it makes it harder to use for specific help.<br />A nice day read, &quot;The River Cafe Wine Primer&quot; is a fine addition for wine lovers who seek to round out their knowledge, but in a crowded market of wine books, there are other more essential books to add to one's library.add to one's library.	2002-11-19

The best recommendation one can give for John White's \\"The Fight\\" simply comes in its longevity in the marketplace. Christian books go out of print like mad, but the classic ones go on and on. The main reason for this is timelessness, and White's primer on how to start one's Christian walk is as appropriate today as it was when first released.<br />One of three books I recommend to every new Christian (Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" and Ortiz's \\"Disciple\\" being the other two), this book is so chock full of basics that it even works as a book for people who are just beginning to seek the Lord. In \\"The Fight\\" are found the core parts of the daily Christian life (summarized here as): Prayer, Listening to God, Sharing the Faith, The Devil, Faith, One's Standing in Christ, Holiness, God's Will, Christian Excellence, and the Battle Around Us.<br />White's background as a psychologist comes through as many of his illustrations have a profundity  that comes from understanding the foibles of humanity, while also avoiding the pitfall of framing everything within psychology's constructs rather than Christianity's (a problem with many Christian books today.) He also brings clarity to difficult issues that every man and woman struggle with in life, shining the light of Christ into even the darkest areas. His insights into topics like lust are so exemplary that I continue to use them when teaching today, since I have never found better explanations that are so human and yet so spiritually astute at the same time.<br />A must for any new Christian, I have routinely given people this book for a baptism gift, so useful is it for starting the journey.	2002-11-19

Beyond allegory, beyond fantasy, this look at the nature of Heaven, Hell, and the denizens of both has radically altered the view of what happens after we die in the lives of more people than any book you will encounter.<br />Lewis provides an utterly original view of the afterlife through the mechanism of a bus trip from Hell to Heaven.  The portrayals of the vast, nearly-empty city in Hell and a Heaven more real and solid than our reality are so profound that many will find their thoughts on the two places forever altered.<br />Also included is an examination of the question that has haunted many: \\"How can a loving God send people to Hell?\\" Lewis brilliantly answers this in a way that is completely satisfying to even the most demanding inquirer. You'll have to read the book to see.<br />There are so many gems in \\"The Great Divorce\\" that any further discussion would spoil the book. But suffice it to say, this work of fiction may be the greatest ever written for provoking long and enjoyable discussions with others.

Given plenty of chances to leave the country, he instead stayed, claiming that the raising up of pastors in Germany during the time of war was essential to the nation's future.<br />But back to the book...<br />\\"Cost of Discipleship\\" is a challenging call to more radical discipleship. The famous line from this book, \\"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die,\\" is the bedrock upon which Bonhoeffer bases his entire premise. That Christ paid a penalty for our sins that cannot be acquired by any means except through His grace and faith in Him alone seems like a given in the Christian life. But Bonhoeffer renews a concept that was under attack in his day by the growing liberal theology: following Christ means dying to self. In the shadow of the rise of psychology that simultaneously arrived with the deconstructionist theology, the idea that must one abandon self to Christ seemed outdated, but Bonhoeffer stayed the course. Dying to self flew in the face of what the intelligentsia were espousing and what the general populace were beginning to believe.<br />Bonhoeffer also broke with his Lutheran predecessor, Martin Luther, who once said, \\"Sin boldly, but love God more boldly still.\\" What this book asks is a consideration of the cost Christ paid for us on the cross. What comes with knowledge of this is the realization that to take sin lightly is to trample on the very blood of Christ. Grace is to be had for those that ask for it, but it is not cheap - an enormous cost was paid. To  sin boldly shows contempt for the death of the Savior.<br />To this day, \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" has remained controversial. At a time when personal fulfillment and the gratification of self are out of control (even in the Church), Bonhoeffer's masterpiece is a clarion call to a generation spiraling out of control. The cheap grace of hyperdispensationalism and the blas&eacute; attitudes of many Christians concerning their own sin need to be countered, and this book provides that in full.<br />While I cannot comment on this translation of \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" (my copy is by a different translator), Bonhoeffer's words will still erupt from the page.

The content is unimpeachable and the choices of his works for inclusion here are a good random mix.<br />That said, the book itself has a flaw common to books of this type. It is not durable enough for extended use by children. Because it contains multiple stories, it will see more use than a single storied book. Books of  this size and length need the strongest bindings and reinforcing possible. A \\"Curious George\\" compendium that we own that is made similarly to the Seuss book fell apart after a few readthroughs, and only the adults handled it. The spine of the Seuss book is weakening after only a year of ownership. Manufacturers need to offer us better quality.<br />I also must say it is disappointing that no complete collection of Suess's material exists. His entire works would be quite large, but it is still odd that no one has seen fit to put everything he wrote for children in a multi-volume set. The best we have at this time is the five selection book here.	2002-11-09

If you would like to teach your child more ASL as they grow (for use as a second language, for instance), you would be better off simply buying one of the several excellent ASL reference books available for about the same price as this one.

Espousing a theology foreign to most postmodern Christians, Edwards lays out the cornerstone of Christian thought of the mid-18th century.<br />As unflinching as his more famous sermon, &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot;, this work develops the idea that what we feel and our true status in Christ are at war with one another, a constant battle that requires the searching of our souls by the Spirit of God in order to find the truth of our standing in Him. For some, the level of introspection and faithfulness demanded of the believer is higher than we might otherwise be prepared to endure. But only by complete surrender, the development of an inner craving for Christ, and spiritual examination can we rest in the assurance of our salvation.<br />This work also holds up a Christian faith that seems radically different  - and more vital - than what we know. For this we should thank Edwards for allowing 21st century men and women a tie to historic Christianity, especially as seen through early-American eyes.<br />&quot;The Religious Affections&quot; is an extremely difficult book to read, not only because of the sentence structure and word choices of the 18th century, but also because of the loaded theology. It is a bombshell to the heart of anyone who earnestly desires to follow Christ. Impossible to ignore, Edwards' book demands a response. No one can read it and be unchanged. The level of discipleship it asks is shocking to modern readers, but ultimately necessary for our salvation.	2002-11-09

Goldberg was so entrenched in the leftist media slant that when - metaphorically - he realized that the earth orbits the sun after being told otherwise for years by his superiors and media siblings, only the most backward of us would be startled at his revelation. If you are a conservative, you already know 90% of what Goldberg trumpets as being so shocking. That the three big news anchors and the folks that back them lean left should surprise no one. The howls of derision offered up by the media concerning this book come off as more amusing than anything, since the depth of scandal here is so blatantly obvious to thinking people.<br />Personally, as an arch-conservative, I found \\"Bias\\" ho-hum. Virtually nothing revealed came as a surprise. In fact, I knew more about some of the incidents than Goldberg.<br />Still, the book has its amusing points. The stuck pig anchor of CBS gets repeatedly skewered so backhandedly by ex-chum Goldberg that every time the author attempts to prove that this book is not a direct slam at his former cohort, he instead proves otherwise. To condense all the biting compliments into one hyperbolic paraphrase would read something like this:<br />\\"Dan is possibly the greatest man ever to breathe. This book is written in no way to impugn this fine man's reputation. Dan and I were such good friends that I even let him perform my son's bris. That he drank the blood of one of the CBS interns and tossed her lifeless corpse into the dumpster behind the studio is an incident we have all let slip from our memories. He truly is an American's American.\\"<br />The book is sprinkled with fun comments that have that sort of tone. It's not a hatchet job per se, but more like death by a thousand cuts. Unfortunately, it still undermines the objectivity of the book. One gets the impression that this is the last we might hear from the author, since he falls prey to his own naïvete, a bleeding shark cannibalized by associates in the midst of a feeding frenzy.<br />If you want a more inciteful and challenging book, Goldberg's \\"Bias\\" has a doppelganger of sorts in Anne Coulter's \\"Scandal\\", a far more enjoyable read and harder hitting to boot. Squarely in the conservative camp rather than a defector from the left, Coulter lets the leftists grind their own axes to use as their personal instruments of self-inflicted destruction, pointing out the lunkheadedness of the liberal viewpoints but simply quoting their own moronic words.r />The book is sprinkled with fun comments that have that sort of tone.

Like many books passing themselves off as Christian, this latest effort from Henry Cloud and John Townsend has a worldview that in no way resembles classical Christianity. So thorough is the deception provided in the words of these two disciples of modern day psychology that many are unable to see how cleverly off this book actually is.<br />Pop-psychology and true Christianity are two competing worldviews. One is correct and the other is a deception. Psychology appears to offer answers and help, but it actually only takes people further away from God. Most of this is due to the fact that psychology's main focus is propping up the self through manmade fixes. The Bible, on the other hand, claims that in order to find true peace and salvation in Christ, self must die - it has become so utterly distorted by the Fall of Man that it cannot be fixed, only crucified.<br />That Cloud and Townsend try to shoehorn these two utterly incompatible worldviews into each other results in a syncretistic disaster. Sadly, it is a disaster that we have become so used to seeing passed off as reality that we have become numb to its true nature. We have a tendency to believe anything we hear often enough - and most Christian books today are filled with this kind of pop-psych pap - so \\"How People Grow\\" goes down smooth and easy. Unfortunately, we can't have it both ways. And though they speak of the Holy Spirit working in this process, the third person of the Trinity comes off as more a self-help group leader than the one who can burn the dross out of someone's life.<br />Part of what makes this book so subtle is the preponderance of Scripture quoted in it. But this book uses the Bible errantly. Hundreds of verses are quoted to shore up the authors' presuppositions, but many are way out of context or interpreted in odd ways, always proving the authors' points even when those points are off base.<br />Many examples of people struggling to overcome their problems (mostly self-inflicted) are included in the book. Cloud and Townsend anecdotally discuss how these people worked through their issues. Tellingly, few overcame their issues through acknowledging their sin, repenting, and crucifying self.<br />A case in point would be appropriate. In Chapter 15, the authors tell the story of three wives. One of the wives is a Christian in a stagnant marriage. She eventually has an affair, divorces her husband, and - as Cloud and Townsend note - claims now to have peace with God. She's growing, and as the authors say, and I quote, \\"[She] did a lot of good things. She grew emotionally and relationally.\\"<br />Doesn't the fact that she ignored God, committed adultery, divorced her husband, and is now living a lie catch anyone as doing a lot of BAD things that created emotional and relational chaos? Isn't this the kind of person that absolutely needs to die to self? Just what kind of growth is this? Not the kind God approves of. Cloud and Townsend do add that this is not an optimal way of growing, but still, guys, just what are you endorsing?<br />I was also put off by the constant references to their other books, especially the \\"Boundaries\\" series. It came off as a cry to buy more of their books. And sure enough, there is an ad for other books of theirs right there on the last page.<br />This book also serves as a model for the self-help groups so common in the Seventies, but now almost entirely discredited in mainline psychology. The groups in the book appear to be like your standard Christian accountability group, but the level of disfunction of the group members is extreme from what the examples the authors give us show. And while the writers soundly endorse the method, we must ask just where all these trained leaders/facilitators are coming from. The average small group leader would be hard pressed to lead a group like this in the manner the authors endorse. Perhaps they also want you to take their extensive training courses at a few thousand a pop so you can lead like they do.<br />For those looking to overcome their problems there is some Truth here (enough for two stars), but it is so buried in glop as to be hardly recognizable.

The six men involved all had been believers for at least five or more years. Our consensus was that this book had nothing to say that we had not already heard elsewhere or dealt with before. We never completed our discussion of it as a group, simply moving on to better things.<br />Can this book help others? Possibly. But is a telling flaw in many modern evangelical &quot;Men's&quot; books that once you've read one, you've read them all. This book has some things in common with &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and others of that genre, the greatest commonality being their superficiality. There is something about these books that renders them slightly askew of historic Christianity, also. It's almost as if the rise of modern day psychobabble has so infiltrated the Church it's impossible to get the historic perspective of real men of faith, now long dead. You compare this book to something Tozer would have written to men and you see how trite the modern works are.<br />Still, considering that a half dozen fairly average Christian guys got little from Morley's book should be critique enough.<br />(Note: the endpiece bio on Morley makes it sound as if he's never had a bad day in his life. It reads so unbelievably that it comes off as arrogant, almost as if the target audience is being held in contempt. Perhaps if the author were writing to fellow CEOs and such it would read fine, but to the average working stiff Morley comes off as being your standard &quot;plastic and Brylcreme&quot; Christian rather than as a real person.)	2002-11-08

The author also goes so far as to claim that there is little possibility of tearful repentence, either. What claims to be \\"The Church\\" is too far gone.<br />Now interpretations of how the end of all things will play out are varied and quite antagonistic toward other views. Even the author claims no perfect end-times analysis. What is claimed, though, is that Christians are falling short of the mark so badly that the very existence of the Church is threatened. The sincerity of the unknown author's passion for the faithful remnant is without a doubt. Nor are the writer's indictments misplaced - there does appear to be a falling away that may only get worse. The \\"retrenching\\" action called for in \\"The Great Dream\\" sounds like the best course for those who desire to be sheep and not goats.<br />Any book this heartfelt cannot be ignored, but \\"The Great Dream\\" does have its issues. The author's very inability to stick with a single end-times interpretation clouds the book. There's a leaning toward classical Dispensationalism (think Hal Lindsey's \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\"), which has its own set of problems. This struggle plays out repeatedly on the very pages of \\"The Great Dream\\", tempering every pronouncement, qualifying every indictment in a way that even bothers the author.<br />\\"The Great Dream\\" wears thin about halfway through. The point that the Church is rapidly becoming apostate is well-taken by then. The cry for radical surrender to Christ is either heeded or it is not. Also, the author's \\"talky\\" style of writing is tiring, especially when the author's internal dialogs are played out on the page.<br />Still, any book this unafraid to rattle the Church's cages gets stars just for its radical call to arms. What readers do with \\"The Great Dream\\" is up to them. I for one will become more vigilant. In the end, that may be the best promotion of the book I can offer.the author.<br />\\"The Great Dream\\" wears thin about halfway through.

His numbers showing the rapid demise of sound preaching, general Biblical knowledge, and dozens of other key talking points affecting Christianity in America are a true wake-up call to a complacent Church. For this, we should thank Barna and his organization for weighing us in the scales and finding us wanting.<br />While Barna scores a hit with the poll figures in &quot;The Second Coming of the Church&quot;, he fails miserably in his solutions for those problems. Barna claims that what the Church needs is better business practices, a closer hewing to successful management techniques when dealing with personnel, and plenty of other misguided answers that have their basis not in the Bible, but in Total Quality Management.<br />The fact is that every problem Barna has so adequately pointed out to us has its corresponding solution not in TQM or any other clever business approach, but in a new awakening of the Church via the work of the Holy Spirit. In short, unless the Church gets down on its knees and repents, then seeks true revival of each individual by the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, no amount of clever worldly wisdom will resolve the issues Barna raises. Why Barna himself is so led astray by the plague of failed marketing and business tricks that have, in part, led to the very dire conditions he notes, is beyond me. It's like spraying a drowning man with a fire hose.<br />Read the book for the excellent polling info, but toss it when Barna sermonizes on how to fix the problems.	2002-11-08

On the heels of his show comes &quot;I'm Just Here for the Food&quot;, one of the most practical cookbooks I have ever seen.<br />The genius behind the book lies in the old &quot;If You Teach a Man to Fish&quot; saw. Brown takes this apporach, explaining in detail why and how different approaches to heating food bring success or failure in recipes. And though the book does include recipes, they are second to understanding why - for example - braising works better or worse in a given cooking situation.<br />Brown's writing and the book's graphic style have a sort of Fifties &quot;boomerang Formica&quot; feel that keep the reading light as a souffl&eacute;, yet as helpful as a pinch of salt in a bland dish.<br />I feel this book (and any of its followups) is essential reading for anyone not classically trained as a chef, but who desires to be master of his own kitchen. &quot;I'm Just Here for the Food&quot; is the best thing to happen to us average guy cooks since the invention of the combo thermometer/BBQ fork.	2002-11-08

Laser-like in its focus, \\"Scandal\\" scrutinizes the leftist bias in the news from a true conservative's viewpoint, further expanding on the basic theme of Goldberg's \\"Bias\\".<br />Rather than rehash what many reviewers have already noted, I'll stick to what is most compelling. Coulter makes her case on several topics and provides details rarely heard or seen elsewhere. For one, I was not aware at the incredible time differences of the news outlets in calling states for Gore and calling them for Bush in the 2000 election. Without fail, they rushed to call states for Gore and held off calling them for Bush (even though the Bush states were less close between the two candidates.) Coulter also thoroughly dismantles the \\"Christian right\\" voting bloc construct so often cited by the liberals who run the media by showing less common ground in right-wing voting patterns than in those of the liberal  left.<br />Others have noted that Coulter stoops to namecalling and some of the dirty tricks she accuses liberals of using. There is a distinction, however, that is being forgotten. Coulter claims that liberals say, \\"Bush is dumb,\\" and they leave it at that. Coulter's namecalling takes more of the form \\"Gore is dumb because....\\" It's one thing to call your opponent a name, but it's entirely another to call them a name and then prove why that name is appropriate.<br />Personally, I found this to be the book \\"Bias\\" was not: thought-provoking and well-written by an erudite insider. While I enjoyed her deft wording, most liberals will be unable to complete \\"Slander\\" simply because they cannot handle the multi-syllabic words. Still, the audience for this is a puzzler; if you are conservative, she preaches to the choir, and if you're not, well, you probably won't get past the first few pages without your head exploding.<br />Amusing and witty throughout, \\"Slander\\" is a worthy bestseller and a compelling look at the leftist obfuscation in the news.nd witty throughout, \\"Slander\\" is a worthy bestseller and a compelling look at the leftist obfuscation in the news.	2002-11-07

Utterly fascinating and comprehensive, The Wine Bible is just the right length to provide even the most discriminating oenophile with all the facts needed to quench his thirst. It is difficult to imagine a better overview of all the wine areas of the world. Certainly there are more scholarly tomes, but MacNeil's ebullient and zestful writing style is utterly charming and never wearying, her descriptions of specific wines so lively you can almost taste them. I wanted to rush out and buy all her recommendations.<br />The layout of the book starts with the basics of how wine is made, what factors make great wine, how to taste, the major grapes and their characters, and other fundamentals. It then proceeds into an extensive look at the countries that produce wine. Each country section breaks down the major wine producing areas within the country, going into great detail to highlight the unique qualities of those areas that bring their wine to life. The country sections also include travel notes, comments about the local food, wineries to visit, and more. At the end of each growing area section, MacNeil includes specific wines of note.<br />This format makes the subject quite approachable, but also leads to the only complaint I have (and it is not enough to take away anything from the book.) Because of the length (900+ pages), the book is written sectionally. Given the scope, MacNeil wrote it in a manner than lends each section to being self-contained. Because of this, when reading several country sections, MacNeil repeats herself many times, often explaining a concept in a later chapter that she had explained earlier. This is done for clarity sake, especially if the book is being used as a reference. For a complete readthrough, though, one can simply skip over what had already been explained previously.<br />If you have a passing knowledge of wine and wish to go to the next level (or simply need an approachable, yet complete reference), I can think of no better place to start than The Wine Bible. MacNeil's love of wine certainly comes through and makes this reference a gripping read, one of the few references you'll find hard to put down.start than The Wine Bible.

This book of Bible stories aimed at the very young is nicely illustrated and fairly well-written. However, it is far too short to be a &quot;Bible&quot; of choice for educating toddlers or those beginning to read.

The Gospel stories included are especially inadequate, failing to do justice to the ministry and life of Jesus.

However, John Eldredge beat me to it.<br />This is a sad book - sad in proving how far the Church has fallen from its roots. Francis Schaeffer has said that what you find in the world you will now find in the Church seven years later, and almost to the day, the Christian men's movement hit its stride about seven years after Bly's \\"Iron John\\". But even as the world has moved beyond Bly, we Christian men are still lugging his (now \\"sanctified\\") baggage around. \\"Wild at Heart\\" simply adds to the burden.<br />By now, we are all familiar with the laments: feminism stole our destiny, our fathers are the cause of our problems, a real man is only truly fulfilled by lugging around a broadsword, and lastly, that we all think with our genitalia. Mix in an appropriate amount of psychobabble, some sprigs of Hemingway and Spillane, and a sprinkling of random Bible verses, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster.<br />Christian men of a hundred years ago would in no ways recognize this book as being Christian, so egregious are the errors and doctrinal deficiencies. A couple cases in point:<br />1) The amount of eisogesis that occurs in this book is staggering. Eldredge reads the Bible through the eyes of William Wallace (of \\"Braveheart\\" fame) rather than through God's eyes. For example, Eldredge heartily advises his son to return pain for pain when the son is confronted by a bully, arguing that despite Jesus' admonitions to turn the other cheek, Jesus was a man's man, a carpenter who hung out with fishermen, therefore it is okay to return like for like. He quotes Jesus' driving the moneychangers out of the temple as a proof text. However, Eldredge totally forgets the entire Passion story, wherein Jesus would NOT defend himself physically against his attackers, and went so far as to not even defend himself verbally. The focus of Jesus' anger as in the temple story is not on his own person, but the person of the Father. The Father was wronged, therefore the anger and actions are justified. We are not to seek justice for ourselves, but for those outside of us. Remember Romans 8:36 - \\"As it is written: 'For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.'\\" Read the life (and death) story of any martyr and you will see the wrongheadedness of Eldredge's beliefs.<br />2) The worship of self, especially as embodied by the unholy alliance of psychology and Christianity, is paramount in this book. It is all about what can be done for me, how I can find fulfillment, find my life. This mentality runs exactly counter to Matthew 10:39 -\\"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\\" Eldredge makes much of a \\"false life\\", but in the end the life he claims is true destroys his own arguments in a fit of circular logic. The very men he claims as heroes mostly lived in a time before pop psychology and \\"finding oneself\\" came to the fore. We can admire men like Lincoln, Wallace, and Washington for their strength, but do you think that Lincoln sat around moping about the fact that his dad treated him badly? Did he abandon his country because of personal tragedies, like the death of his children, so he could instead blabber to his shrink about his personal needs going unmet? Despite the fact that Eldredge dismisses \\"sucking it up\\", the truth is that real Christian men do suck it up. They know that life is greater than their own needs and wants, therefore they crucify the self in order to pursue the greater need. Eldredge laments that Christian men are bored. I contend that if those same men every truly tasted the fulness of God by dying to self, then the staggering nature of the greater need outside their own search for fulfillment would be made apparent to them and they would never know boredom again.<br />Is Eldredge right in that men are hurting? Yes,he is. And to his credit (and good enough to rescue him from the dreaded \\"one star\\" rating), he nails most of the problems. His deficiency is in his answers to those problems. Unfortunately, he sees the world through a syncretistic lens that distorts his views. Because of this, \\"Wild at Heart\\" makes a caricature of everything it discusses. It poses a form of maleness and male Christianity that looks good on the surface, but is empty underneath. Read this book in the light of books like Edwards' \\"Religious Affections\\", Bonhoeffer's \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\", and Schaeffer's \\"The Great Evangelical Disaster\\" to see it for what it is truly worth.he is.

As an educator with over fifteen years in the computer industry, I've &quot;looked at life from both sides now.&quot; And the truth is, Stoll is 100% on target with his assessment of the primrose path down which computerization is leading education.<br />For those looking for a more scholarly work that addresses the false promises spouted by Gates and his ilk, look elsewhere (John Locke's &quot;The De-Voicing of Society&quot; is a prime example), as Cliff Stoll writes in a more popular style.<br />The amount spent on purchasing, maintaining, and updating both computer hardware and software borders on the criminal, with school administrators caught between the veritable rock and hard place. The populist idea that computer usage equals brighter students is a poison for which there is no antidote. Stoll is correct: the hard way is the only way. Nor can there be any substitute for excellent teachers and face-to-face dialog. The overemphasis on computers provides an easy out for all three points.<br />There is no sin in confessing that this path is a deadend. But with so much money riding on the decision, the outcome seems pre-ordained. Stoll shares this less encouraging belief.<br />I once encountered in Palo Alto a network specialist whose sole work was with two Silicon Valley school districts. His consulting and implementation fees earned him a cool quarter million a year - a quarter million that could easily have provided dozens of other more beneficial educational programs. It was his soulless laugh over the way he taking these schools for a ride that was the clincher for me.<br />Yes, the hard way is the only way.

While Adams humor flies high in &quot;the same way that bricks don't,&quot; first-timer Jasper Fforde merely skims the terra firma.<br />The premise, an alternate Earth dominated by a pop-culture more attuned to Good Will Shakespeare's sensibilities than Good Will Hunting's, is truly worthy. Mix in time travel, an endless Crimean War, computer-less technology, humorous character names (Acheron Hades, main character Thursday Next, Braxton Hicks, etc.) and you have a formula for fun.<br />&quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; is a decent read, but misses on several accounts. Fforde's female &quot;anti-Bond&quot;, Thursday Next, is written in a formulaic way designed to accent her tough, yet puppy-dog nature. The result is Ally McBeal with a gun. You wanted to use the author's plot device of entering into the book to shake her until she snapped out of it.<br />Another failure is in the actual writing technique. Certain plot points receive an enormous amount of build-up, but others are just suddenly &quot;there&quot;, an annoying contrivance. This raises the &quot;Aw C'mon!&quot; quotient to dizzying heights, even in a loopy fantasy like this one.<br />Lastly, while it is possible to write lunacy without the author's smirk showing, Fforde has his cemented in place through most of the book. It gets very tiring. It's as if poor Jasper was that kid in school whose act for attention has worn very thin. The &quot;Look at me, I'm being funny!&quot; pleas wear the reader down.<br />For those who love humorous sci-fi with a big dash of the absurd added for extra measure, I would stick with the works of Adams. He's the true Shakespeare of that genre.	2002-03-13

This book is so profound, yet so simple, that even those who are seeking will benefit.<br />Ortiz cleaves to the classic belief that to call oneself \\"a Christian\\" means surrendering all to Christ. We die to live. By giving up our corrupted lives we are able to take on His perfect life. The lordship of Christ must reign supreme in the life of the disciple. This runs counter to much of what Christians are hearing in church on Sunday or reading from the Christian bestseller lists. \\"Disciple\\" explores all aspects of this surrender and what it means for those of us who are born-again.<br />Rarely does a Christian book achieve such beautiful lucidity while also being readable by such a large cross-section of the populace. The conversation depicted between the disciple and Jesus on what is required to follow is eloquent, but oh so easy to understand. Theology comes difficultly to many, but not as explained in \\"Disciple\\" - it becomes a soul-stirring joy.<br />By all means, read this book.

This book continues that tradition.<br />Yes, God does want to bless us. But what blesses us is not the same from one person to another. And blessings may actually look like curses on the surface.<br />For those just beginning the journey of faith in Christ, this book sets an unrealistic expectation. While it is easy to see that Jabez's prayer for prosperity was answered affirmatively, how then should we view a person like John the Baptist, a man called by Jesus as one of the best servants of God? John owned nothing, was martyred by beheading, and while imprisoned even expressed doubts about Jesus' role as Messiah. John must not have been praying Jabez's prayer.<br />A simple scan of the Gospels shows that Jesus himself approached each person he ministered to uniquely, not with a formula. One person might need to receive (lepers, for example) while another might need to give away (the rich, young ruler). The prayer of Jabez says nothing about what we might need to surrender up in order to grow deeper in Christ.<br />Lastly, what do we say to those for whom this prayer does not work? There are many who do not prosper (especially in the sense espoused in the book), who do not find release from evil habits. What can we say to them? This book does not answer that question.<br />As an antidote for this book, I would recommend &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; by Dietrich Bonhoeffer instead.	2002-01-17

More biographical than other works by Yancey, it profiles 13 people influential in restoring Yancey's hope in Christ and His Church. The mix primarily includes authors, doctors and priests/ministers. He even goes so far as to include Gandhi, a non-believer. In that, Yancey is brave enough to acknowledge that even ardent believers can learn from those that do not believe.<br />The only weakness that prevented this from being a five-star recommendation is the fact that Yancey turned a blind eye toward high-profile evangelical ministers. Certainly Yancey has learned something in his walk from a Bill Hybels, Billy Graham, or another of that stature. This would provide this book with at least one point of contact with someone familiar to a larger audience. (Some might argue that Dr. Koop fulfills this role, but I am not certain that many know his convictions. Nor is he a &quot;preacher/teacher&quot; in the traditional sense.) Also, Yancey's superlative abilitity to humanize the people about whom he writes would translate into a new perspective on one of these major evangelicals.<br />A profound book from a consistently excellent author.	2001-12-19
