His other books follow this same format: recipes, then variations.  But here, the possibilities are endless, since every recipe has a list of what you can add to make it even better.  He and his cowriter say that they are unabashed chocolate lovers.  No wonder, because every recipe is loaded with chocolate.  I waited for this book to come out, because I liked the other &quot;ultimate&quot; books so well.  They're down-to-earth, no gimmick books--you don't have to put up with celebrity egos or foodie snobbery.  In the end, there are just lots of good brownie recipes, along with blondies, frostings, and even recipes for doctoring mixes.  A chocolate lover's dream, without a lot of fuss and fandango--just what a brownie should be.	2002-09-21

Most of the recipes here are simple; the food, satisfying.  But this book is too enamored with its own success.  Most egregious are the listed recipes that are not found in the book, but are simply referenced to her first book.  Savvy marketing, no doubt.  It makes sure you buy both books.  But irritating, nonetheless.  And there's just so much rank sloppiness going on.  The party for twenty?  Look at the yield in the recipes--some are for 6 people, some are for 8, others, more.  So what do you do if you're indeed having twenty over?  Someone, I think, just slapped together a bunch of recipes and thought, well, we're already a success.  Why sweat the details?	2001-05-10

Most novels (rightly so) are like rivers--you jump on and ride the waves, coast through the shallows.  WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS is like a still pond.  You take your boat out in the middle and (to borrow Thoreau's metaphor) plumb the bottom with a measuring stick--to see if it's solid, to see how far down it goes.  In the end, the plot's a simple thing: lost-and-found parents, as it were.  But the emotional consequences?  The ways the narrator prefers blindness, or a kind of myopic sight, to clarity?  Devastating.  Beautiful.  Words escape me, as his parents do him.  I found my time with the narrator to be like my time with any good friend--I never know the whole story, only pieces, more and more as time goes on.  I put them together, decide which memories are red herrings, which events are important--all the while listening for the whole that escapes me.  Ishiguro's talent reminds me of Jane Austen's: precise, beautiful, small (this is not the right word--not small-minded or country-headed, but rather compact, exacting.  The Mona Lisa, not the Sistine Chapel).  This novel's rather like a beautiful miniature he's building up, one stroke at a time.	2001-01-31

It's more like WHITE NOISE, Delillo's masterpiece.  But darker.  (The  revelations in supermarkets, the apocalytpic men in environmental hazard  suits?  They're all here.)<br />Yes, I was repelled (somewhat) by the  characters.  And yes, I laughed out loud anyway.  And yes, the joke then  went on far too long--which I think was the point, after all: the joke's  becoming stale even as I laugh at it.<br />I found the prose breathless--at  times, I was irritated by the rabid, present-tense drive to what's next.   In fact, in her drive forward, Homes seemed to forget her own plot--right  after Paul gets his groin tattoo and complains all day about its hurting,  he has a brutal, fisty fight with his wife--and amazingly never seems to  worry about the tattoo.<br />OK, so it's a tad sloppy, but I kept reading, on  and on.  And in the end, I guess that's Homes' mystique.  I'm not sure how  she does it.  Perhaps by being so engaged?  Perhaps by never laughing at  her own characters?  Perhaps by being spot-on in her prophetic stance, a  doom-sayer about suburban woes?  I don't know--but she's one terrific  writer, and I can't wait to read the famed ALICE, which I bought while I  was halfway through this one.	2000-06-04

So Iapproached this new novel as a fan, excited to read it.  But once intoit, I was instantly bogged down in prose that seems tired, at best. Every scrap of dialogue, line by line most of the time, is glued down with reflections, reactions, ruminations, memories, allusions, wispy sexual fantasies, subplots, or (sometimes even &quot;and&quot;) snide rejoinders.  It takes pages and pages of overwrought, adjective-laden prose just to get there.  I am not one for Grisham-style speed.  But I would like the plot, hackneyed and tired as it is, to move a little faster.  After all, from the start, we know where this thing's going. Sure, you can get on the interstate and go somewhere you've been before.  You can even take some of the turn-offs.  But why do you have to examine every single blade of grass along a route well-traveled?	2000-04-03

Her characters were driven forward by the theme, the core of the story.  Yes, they were quirky and irritating.  Yes, they were funny.  But they served a  larger purpose.  Unlike Mr. Wilcox's.  I kept waiting for a point.  I  thought perhaps I caught the whiff of it for a while: submerged gay life in  a Southern town.  But no, that was just another false lead, in a book full  of them.  So many quirky little details, doing nothing, going nowhere.  For  example, at one point, the characters are talking and a dog walks up on the  porch to sniff around, as it does every night.  And that's it.  Period.  There's no point to the dog, no reason for it to be in the story.  It's  just another quirky, funny, little, meaningless detail.  One of billions.  Enough to drag any plot to a dead halt.	2000-02-08

At times, the author doesn't know who's consciousness he's writing--and many chapters are no more than a muddled  mush of point of view.  Far from H. James, to whom Mr. Hollinghurst is  often compared, this book needs a quick course in how-to-write fiction.   Chapter four is almost laughable, a textbook case of bad writing and poor  technique.  Sure, as escapist ficion, the book has some merit.  I read it  at the end of each day, after work.  But I quickly tired of the pretentions  to poetry, the slippery, gushy writing which made little sense.  (My own  favorite occurred when the author descibed Robin's pain at having lost his  lover to AIDS to &quot;the kind of pain you feel when you lose a lover to a  disease.&quot;  Well, indeed.)  I tired most of all of the characters, all  of whom seemed worn-out stereotypes of the mid-80s club scene.  But now,  the melancholy is mostly middle-aged: perhaps life really is a party and  I'm not invited anymore.  Even the sexual trysts have all the passion of a  long, dull afternoon and torn snippet of porn.  It's not poetry.  It's just  boredom, masquerading as a story.	2000-02-08

Or if not his picture, then at least his name, please--I might forget the star power of the author.  But alas, no such luck.  Since he's  even got his name embedded in the title, he can be everywhere all at once.   I guess some people are impressed with hype, could use even more of it than  is dished up every day in our culture.  I, on the other hand, could have  used some recipes that didn't involve cooking for family reunion size  crowds.  And I could have used some recipes that involved more than cooking  everything indoors and then lugging a pot out to the grill to finish it  off.

But then I was left with the rest of the book.  And there just didn't seem enough  plot to hang the thing together.  So what that Stella is this and Stella is  that?  By the time the revelations happened, I didn't care about them.  In  fact, by the time they happened, I wished they hadn't, thinking it would  have been much more delightful had she been a nobody doing nothing, instead  of a somebody doing nothing.  The last few pages were simply a drift into  morals and wrappings and endings--all of which didn't fit the murky waters  of the book.

But this diatribe, masquerading as a novel, left me cold and bored.  I didn't think the characters ever evolved--instead, they came upon right and wrong  answers in completely predictable ways.  Yes, the politic ideology is mine.  But I don't want to have it parading around in the guise of a story.  I  felt Kingsolver's complete disinterest in Reverend Price was disheartening,  at best.  He was no more than a pasteboard Bogeyman.  And her grasp of  Baptist religious rites was woefully inadequate.  Why would a Baptist  minister quote the Apocrypha?  And why would he be interested in baptizing  children?  The lower churches, like the Baptists, consider baptizing only  an external mark of an internal conversion--and therefore unnecessary for  &quot;eternal life.&quot;  Furthermore, the last three books of her novel,  once the Rev. Price is missing, devolve into a hideous set of  &quot;tellings.&quot;  I am constantly told &quot;what has happened,&quot;  not allowed to experience it as an upfront narrative.  I simply felt that  Kingsolver may have believed she has outgrown the need for a good editor.  Someone needed to bring a sharp pair of pruning sheers and a good sense of  narrative development to the project.	1999-07-05

I was laughing, over the abyss.  Some paragraps left me stupified with giggles.  Her similes are simply beautiful: elegant and substantial.

Sure, they're all there.  But in the end, perhaps &quot;A  Widow for One Year&quot; is a cautionary tale about thematics, for at times  it seems more &quot;smart essay&quot; than good novel.  Yes, the  fact/fiction, novel/autobiography line blurs for the writerly  characters--but it's at best a hackneyed point, one rehashed after reading  too many lit. crit. essays, I suppose.  Yes, the endless repetitions in the  plot allow the story to meld on itself--but again, pretty hackneyed, lit.  crit. stuff.  The novel that then remains, after the &quot;smart&quot;  stuff collapses in its own obviousness (I won't even mention the banal  moral at the end of &quot;sometimes, time stands still&quot;), is a rather  threadbare plot combining very, very easy resolutions (&quot;I love you,  Marion&quot;--this, after almost forty years of abandonment) with quippy,  quirky incidents, none of which is strong enough to give the novel either  cohesion or force.  Yes, there are, of course, some pristine  &quot;Irving&quot; moments--that well-known irony that overreaches and yet  remains very funny and insightful--but the various pieces of a novel, even  one from a so-called big novelist, do not a novel make.	1998-10-01

She has a stunning talent: precision, grace, and irony.  In these days when cynicism passes for irony, and the splatter-effect seems, at best, a narrative strategy, Moore writes beautiful, haunting prose, full of sadness, full of grace.  I am reminded of E. Dickinson's same stance: &quot;Before I got my eye put out,/I liked to see as well/As other Creatures that have Eyes/and know no other way.&quot;	1998-07-02

Seems some author had to crank out a second novel really fast to catch the wave of her last success.  It's been a long time since I've witnessed such muddled narration--most of the time, I couldn't figure out whose point of view saw what, much less who the various pronouns in a paragraph referred to.  I gave up, just letting &quot;she&quot; stand for any bitter woman--found it went along just as well that way.  I think the novel was forced out--and shows its strain, like the pinched head of a baby from a pair of forceps.  That the two lead characters can drive from L. A. to Oklahoma City by sunset on the same day they start out, stoppin' their tired, ol' bones at a flea market or two along the way, was enough, right from the start, to do me in.  Wow, they were doin' about 390 miles an hour, by my count--all to get across country and meet up with a bunch of stereotypes they call friends and relatives.  But then the moral of the thing fits a life lived in such fast cars and easy destinations: all you coastal, ironic types, there's good news awaitin' fer you--you can become a hick again, ifen you set yourseff to work real hard on it.	1998-05-26

I have toured battle fields, to be shown the exact spot my &quot;ancestrals&quot; fell.  I have watched &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; the requisite number of times.  But as my Granddad used to say, &quot;Skunks smell worse once they're dead.&quot;  Reading Cold Mountain--I'll avoid the metaphor of plowing--is like having to sit through eighth-grade botany all over again.  I was plum wore out with the endless, mind-numbing strings of details, most of them no more enlightening than the names of plants and trees.  Wow, Latin.  And wow, they got themselves a bunch of plants down there in North Carolina.  I'll bet nature's supposed to be something that regenerates people.  Jest like suffering.  Jest like violence.  Skunks smell worse once they're dead.  Then there's this: I don't understand a novel about how novels are bad.  It's like some kind of weird, internalized self-hatred.  When Ada has to put up her books, 'cause they ain't real, and 'cause they is gettin' in the way of her livin' her life, I said to myself, &quot;Why, Mr. Frazier, therapy don't cost more'en you can afford at this point.&quot;	1998-03-06

I was not sure if Delillo was the greatest writer in this decade--I can't do the Kakutani thing of &quot;century&quot; because it seems unendurably silly--or if he was a (re)creation of B. T. Parnum, the whole suckers and minutes thing.  In the end--if there is such a thing--the book resists being a book.  It is a compendium, a history, a notebook, a novel, a catalogue, a film synopsis, a stand-up comedy routine.  It is cold and chilling in its refusals.  Yet there stands that breathless prose. Those words, themselves the very underworld of the book, the things Marvin and others cannot remember for the life of them with their helter-skelter refusal to name, to see, to be.  I leave my pronouns ambiguous, on the garbage heap of my prose, because that's what Delillo demands of me.  He takes my words away.  He leaves me with the unendurable silences that gap the story of his characters' lives, leaving them down wind, leaving their lives floating in a larger story that starts (like all history) butt-end first and drives back around the bases to its home plate.	1997-12-10

Everyone talks about this book as some struggle of humanity to makes its own expressions in the face of secrets and lies.  Instead, I found a depressingly banal group of insights, from an essentially and elementally fragmented and isolated group of so-called friends.  They exchange a series of aphorisms as if these trite little snippets mean something, all the while deepening their own alienations from each other and from their own feelings.  Their sole response then is to do their duty--and indeed they do.  The book ends with no surprise--and I am left wondering whether indeed any action in such a trite and hackneyed world, glib to the core, has any inherent meaning outside its adherence to some last and final order.	1997-10-31

The first story, with all that blindness and sight blather, made me think: &quot;Oh, no, not this again.  There really is nothing new under the sun.&quot;  But I read on, to discover that the rehashed metaphors and neuroses can still sparkle.  The narrator of these stories is a barely-menopasal Holden Caulfield, another New Yorker type.  This one veers through her life, never really connecting her insights to any of the deeper ironies they contain.  She is starkly, sternly innocent--and rightfully nuts.  She sees and speaks associationally, in long, looping digressions that circle back on themselves to reveal the poverty of her circumstances.  Along the way, she finds her devoid insights and splatters them out at the reader, as if they make sense, much like that adolescent boy who donned New Yorker print a long time ago.

While I found some of the plot twists unconvincing--the whole fight sequence in the middle was little more than a muddle--I delighted in the ways the plot hit me in waves, its thick rhythms only clarified in its deep, salty prose.

Older now, and wiser (and fainter too as Wisdom is), I find myself searching for other delinquent Palaces--and return to Lolita to discover this time the repellent tale of a pedophile and his wonderful, wonder-filled lies.  While the book bogs in the travelogue sections, I was left with the feeling that Nabakov had grabbed American culture by its, well, underbelly and given it a good shake.  I loved the preface and afterward with their lies almost as much as I loved Humbert's tale of self-induced woe-begone. Nabokov is almost as good a liar as his creature	1997-04-29

Then again, I suppose he's learned how to write a headline over the years.  This book degenerates into a long, rambling account of all the great sex Browning has had--and then makes an even more telling turn, if not a dangerous one.  Browning moves from the personal to the general with fluidity--and there's the rub.  The argument is something like this: &quot;I find community this way, so we all find community this way.&quot;  It's that &quot;so&quot; that bugs the daylights out of me.  It reminds me of Martha Stewart: I make a cake this way, so you must make one this way.  Ugh.  How self-absorbed can someone get	1997-04-13

Yes, yes--you know the shtick: I read CATCHER when I was in high school--and, like all things banally true, have rediscovered it again at 35.  But what a book!  I'm not sure any writer, no matter how talented, can pull off consistency of voice the way Salinger did.  I could only think of Twain's Huck Finn, perhaps Cather's Jim Burden, and Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.  I felt as if I had touched (if you will) a real person, a real voice, one that lived on days after I had finished the book.  I'm sure the plot is far too contrived (the homosexuality, veiled and polite, is so predictable as to be laughable), and the other characters disappear into a miasama of similarity.  But then Holden.  He remains, a voice of unfettered adolescence born out of the fevered memory of adulthood, mine and Salinger's.  A genuine voice, the &quot;real thing&quot; (without James's silly ambiguities)--perhaps no reader can ask for more	1997-04-01

Song of Solomon is compelling on any level: a man's quest to find himself in a world bent on destroying that very self.  Full up with Calypsos and Sirens and Scyllas and Charybdises, this novel brings its hero home on a wing and a prayer, so to speak, and makes its reader realize, deep in the springs of our cynical culture, that oppression is not, thank God, the end of the story	1997-03-25

We might even be talking pre-Glasgow here.  I did not sigh, cry, and die as I read it.  I thought, well, the sure way, once you are living in Manhattan, to get a book published is to make your way down South and see what the rubes are up to.  Read Penn Warren or O'Connor if you want to soak in this murky nostalgia for the Southern eccentric.  And then move on, for goodness sake	1997-01-28

Her characters are, thank God, not homespun philosophers who chatter away about table linens in deeply symbolic ways.  They are ruthless rubes who cut a wide swath through each other's lives.  And Karr is the most ruthless of the bunch, impaling her family, her culture, with her incisor wit.  She is not chewing over her past.  She's tearing off great globs of it and spitting it out	1997-01-28
