Lexi Davis tells her readers the answer in this interesting novel, where two main genres collide for one great story.<br /><br />When Sunnie makes a pact to show her three bachelor friends, Rice, Coach and Geffen, some real estate property in exchange for attending Sunday Services, Sunnie finds herself forced to show her friends a home she gets bad vibes from as soon as she saw it. Yet, undeterred by her qualms, the boys plunged headlong into a new business venture with plans to turn the once-famous brothel into a 5-star, VIP resort.<br /><br />Little did they know, Sunnie's intuition is right on target. The formal owner, Vixx, who was condemned to live in the attic for 100 years for the inexcusable crime of falling in love with a human, is counting the days for her return as the madam of the evil brothel. Now forced to take extraordinarily steps to re-claim her home, she creates a plan which allows her to intricate herself into the lives of the three men. Her plan is well underway, but she's underestimated the power of friendship, and Sunnie, who's not giving her friends up without a fight.<br /><br />Pretty Evil is an unusual tale combing Christian Fiction with Sci-Fi. Not many people are creative and talented enough to weave these two genres successfully, yet Ms. Davis was able to do it seamlessly. With a sprinkling of comedic relief and just enough romance to fill someone's sweet tooth, Pretty Evil is a refreshing story from a talented new author.<br /><br />Joy Farrington.	2005-09-09

Book of the Month for the month of October, 2005.<br /><br />Andrew Wilson is a successful author whose life is exactly where he wants it to be - well, not quite. For starters, although he and his father are finally starting to form a relationship, Andrew's mistrust keeps it from forming into anything deeper. His love life is not worth mentioning, since the one person he would even consider having a relationship with his is platonic friend, Carmen. Since Andrew is content with his life, he is not worried about these minute details, and spends most of his days following a schedule which he rarely deviates from. Andrew's organized life come crashing down when he meets the beautiful, rich, too-good-to-be-true Meka, who sends his life into a tailspin after one mind-blowing night of love-making turns into a deadly case of fatal attraction. Meka is much more than what she appears to be, and armed with supernatural abilities, plans to make Andrew hers, whatever the cost.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Within The Shadows, as Massey kept me in suspense throughout the whole story. I love the way the author took his time with the reader; teasing, then suddenly filling the book with so much action and suspense it made you want more. As with any good thriller, I was anxious to see how the story ended and Massey did not disappoint. Within The Shadows is perfect for readers looking for a good suspense/thriller, yet not too intense for the \\"scaredy cats\\" who normally shirk from reading books in this genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joy Farrington<br /><br />(...)	2005-08-04

Despite a successful career and a family that loves her, demons from her past are threatening her future. At 17, Coreen was the victim of a date-rape that resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, and immediately put the child up for adoption in an attempt to forget the heart-wrenching incident. Years later, to Coreen's dismay, the child she gave up has grown into a woman hell-bent on revenge.<br /><br />30-year old Frieda Davis is a determined woman on a mission, stopping at nothing to find her biological mother. Instead of a heart-felt reunion, Frieda is out for revenge, and blames the woman who abandoned her at birth for years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her adoptive father.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Coreen's career takes off, placing her on a public platform, and she fears this recognition could lead to unwanted attention from the child she doesn't know. It doesn't take long for trouble to start in the Treadwill home, and Coreen's rising professional status soon leaves her husband Bates feeling like a failure. Those are the least of Coreen's concerns, as she's constantly haunted by the idea that the child she gave up will soon find her.<br /><br />Her fears are not unfounded, as Frieda is hot on her trail. Frieda moves forward with a well-orchestrated plan to ruin her birth mother's life and destroy all that Coreen holds dear, beginning with one of her beloved stepsons, Glen. Before Frieda can follow through with her plan, though, she falls in love but quickly reverts to plan B. Unwilling to release the pain and bitterness she's carried for years, Frieda quickly learns that revenge isn't always sweet.<br /><br />If You Walked in My Shoes forces us to think twice about keeping secrets from those we love. While some sentences seemed weighed down by excessive wording and phrases that remind you these characters are seasoned, the story flows through its few slow spots and is overall, a good read. Each page keeps you wondering how Coreen will handle her situation, and whether her family and career will remain intact once she faces those demons.<br /><br />By the end, mother and daughter leave us wondering if they'll ever find peace, and their place in life. Foster leaves us cheering for both women in different ways.<br /><br />Reviewed by Pat Tucker<br /><br />(...)how Coreen will handle her situation, and whether her family and career will remain intact once she faces those demons.

Trying to seek happiness in a very chaotic world, he falls in love, or thinks he's fallen in love with various women, creating the well-known baby-momma-drama. Learning lessons through all of his so-called trials, he finally finds the happiness he seeks in both his career and his love life. Thank God he did, because if he had one more episode of unprotected sex, I would have referred him to a clinic for an explanation of the dangers of HIV/AIDS.<br /><br />There is one sex scene in the book where he describes how a young lady of the fairer persuasion (who am I fooling, she was White) figured that to please her man, she should call him Boo, and when going to see him, bring a bucket of chicken and a forty. Obviously this worked, because he succumbed and had sex with her.<br /><br />I found this book to be your typical ghetto relationship book, starting off with an egotistical man stuck on himself and ending with a \\"playa hatin\\" poem. I found quite a few typographical and grammatical errors, and would like to inform the author that the word for an exclusive relationship with one person is \\"monogamous\\" and not \\"maganese\\", which is a type of metal. I also felt that by the end of the book, the author was trying to rush and squeeze everything in at the last minute without answering pertinent questions that left the reader hanging. If there were a sequel to this book, I would not rush to read it, and would be scared that it would follow the pattern of the first book. This book reflects the type of writer that needs to write something that is enriching without thinking that vengeance or revenge has to be sought when you have been wronged.<br /><br />Reviewed by Elizabeth Edwards<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />Elizabeth Edwards was born and raised in Washington, D.C.

Well, I just experienced those same feelings after I finished reading The Tribe by Gregory Townes.<br /><br />The book begins with the birth of Malik, the destined King of The Death Tribe. The Death Tribe consists of 12 children ranging in age from thirteen to sixteen who live in the jungles of Africa. Each child was born with god-like powers, silver eyes, and a mark in the shape of the infinity sign. Once someone lays eyes on them, they instantly know how special and unique they are. But, when their respective tribes shunned them after they unknowingly cause havoc in their villages, they are sent to the jungle where they soon unite and become a family. When a slave trader, Captain Pearson, becomes obsessed with capturing the \\"darkies\\" with strange powers, everything they know and love is ripped from them. Once they are captured, they are placed in three separate ships and sent to different parts of the world.<br /><br />In present-day New York, a young girl named Star holds the key to bringing The Tribe back together. However, if they are reunited, it could ultimately bring destruction to the world. A group of fanatical people are obsessed with gaining the power of The Death Tribe and will do anything to get it. The only person who can stop them from using Star for their evil agenda is her father, David, and nobody messes with Daddy's little girl.<br /><br />The Tribe is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. Excellently executed, Townes carves a huge chunk out of the literary world and claims it as his own. Throughout the book, Townes intertwines the history of Slavery and The Middle Passage and helps the reader visualize the torment many Africans went through during that time. He also connects the behavior of people in the past with present day society and shows the reader that the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />It doesn't matter which genre you prefer, The Tribe can and should be read by everyone. The only thing about the book I didn't like was that it ended. Keep on writing Mr. Townes, I look forward to your next novel.be read by everyone.

She presented it to me after talking passionately about her book. But there was no way she could prepare me for the exciting world she created in Man Killer. With a combination of drama, science fiction, and suspense, Denise Campbell truly came into her own in this book.<br /><br />The story is about 4 women, each sexually abused earlier in their life. Now, successful businesswomen, they created a vicious vigilante team that is determined to prosecute sex offenders in their own court of law. However, when the one they call the Spider Queen officially joins the group, all hell brakes loose and the women start to get a taste of their own medicine.<br /><br />Although the novel has enough sex and violence to satisfy the most avid drama addict, this novel has a deeper meaning, which I hope readers will take the time to decipher. Although the story is an exaggeration of what could happen to someone whose been sexually abused, the author obviously wants readers to understand what the vicious cycle of sexual abuse can do to a person's well being.<br /><br />[...]	2005-04-14

I became so involved in the protagonist, Tamara Hightower's life, her pain and happiness became my own. I also became deeply enthralled in the plot. I was so lost in the book, I forgot I wasn't lying in my bed reading a book but instead imagined myself in New Jersey where the novel takes place.<br /><br /> Tamara is the selfish, self centered, inconsiderate, domineering, woman who I was prepared to hate. Surprisingly, I became sympathetic to her problems. Although she started most comments with &quot;I need&quot; or &quot;I want&quot; I began to relate to her and came to realize what a great person she is. I soon discovered her sometimes abrasive attitude was merely an armor she used to protect her emotions.<br /><br /> Although I was rooting for her, how Tamara lucked out and met Sheldon, her child's father, is beyond me. By all accounts, Sheldon, a smart, savvy man from a prominent and rich family, should have stayed clear of Tamara. However he was instantly attracted to her and saw past her sometimes negative attitude towards him. Instead of letting her aloof matter push him away, he courted her till she finally relented to date him. As there relationship progressed, he received glimpses of the great qualities she possess. Qualities which a lot of people (including some of her family members) never get to see.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, suffering from a bad case of post partum depression, Tamara decides to take a break from motherhood and sends Sheldon Jr. to live with his father. However, after years of neglecting their son, Sheldon decides to force Tamara's hand hoping she'll discover what a wonderful son they have. Through the support of her best friend, Monique, Tamara struggles to learn what motherhood is really all about.<br /><br /> Instantly intriguing with a great plot and even greater characters, Natalie Darden created a world I was instantly swept into. The witty dialog and enjoyable characters made me wish the novel would never ends. Applauds to you Ms. Darden as you make a grand entrance into the literary world.orld I was instantly swept into.

Denise's actions causes events which may put Emoire's marriage and life at risk.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this novel but my only problem with the book was the size. It's pretty compact and readers might feel a little nervous about buying a book so small. However, don't let the size fool you. The book may be smaller than normal but it reads larger then life. It read like a soap opera and a lifetime movie rolled into one. &quot;All Fall Down&quot; is a true page turner and I loved every delicious moment of it.	2004-03-10

The love of his life, Yarni, the narrator of the story is stunned and doesn't know what to do. Yarni met Des at the tender age of fifteen and he quickly became a huge part of her life. When Des goes to prison, Yarni, who recently graduated from high school, must fend for herself. She quickly assimilates herself to Des' world of drug dealers, hustlers and gold diggers in order to keep herself in the lifestyle she's used to. Yarni soon becomes engrossed in the game but doesn't realize how deep she is, until a a series of events makes her take a look at the life she made for herself.<br />I was instantly caught up in the plot of &quot;A Hustler's Wife&quot; but was soon scratching my head as the first few pages began with Des receiving a guilty verdict for murder. It then jumped to Yarni remembering when she first heard about the murder to Yarni remembering the first time she met Des. Confused? So was I. Eventually, I got used to Turner's writing style and started enjoying the clever, but poorly executed, plot. However, my attention was so drawn to the grammatical errors and lack of character and scene development that it took away from the story. Also, I was introduced to so many characters, I started to lose track of who was who. As the story became more intricate, I was jumped from scene to scene with very little smooth transitions. At times, I wasn't sure who Yarni was conversing with and at one point, the writer contradicted herself (which just added to my confusion). Overall, if Turner had put more effort in editing &quot;A Hustler's Wife&quot; I would have loved it. Unfortunately, the choppy layout of the story took away from, what would have been, a great urban story.	2004-01-30

For years, Junebug had to deal with five different personalities in his mind, without any professional help. Each personality is based on stories, told to Junebug, by his grandma at a early age. Although Junebug realizes that he has a mental problem, he never sought professional help. While in prison he meets John, his cell mate, who committed a crime because of a mental problem he never sought help for. Junebug and John become close friends and it's John that suggest Junebug speaks with a professional when he gets out of prison. When Junebug is released, he starts to get his life back together. He moves back to his old apartment, gets a job and starts to see a psychiatrist. All is going well until one of his personalities, Elizabeth, decides to teach Junebug a lesson which could change his life, forever.<br />Delores Thornton has created some memorable characters in \\"Anybody Seen Junebug?\\". I became very interested in the lives of The Davis Family and their unconditional support of Junebug. Their love and support for each other was very heart warming. I was amazed at the lengths John went through to keep the family together after their mother was killed by a drunk driver.<br />Also, as I was reading \\"Anybody Seen Junebug?\\", I couldn't help but analyze the judicial system. I started to think about all the black men in prison who may be dealing with the same problems Junebug and John went through. For all the crimes committed by them, who ever took the time to consider that maybe a mental problem is the basis behind it. Society will sit back and blame their family, the school system, television and rap music before they really seek to find out what may really be the problem.  I wonder how many smart, loving and strong brothers are locked up right now because they were trying to deal with a mental anguish on their own.<br />Thornton was able to write a interesting novel without creating the stereotypical sexually charged, dramatic, back stabbing characters that seems to be popping up in other novels lately.

After a comment from a friend makes her realize how one sided the relationship is, she tries to take back some control of her future plans. However, it may be too late because an event occurs that will change her life forever.<br />  Moody Holiday wrote Sweet Redemption with a poet's pen taking everyday words and making them enchanting. I loved how well her characters were written and how she had the ability to bring them to life. You can picture them in your mind so vividly you'll forget they're not real. Shanelle and Alex's love for each other is written so poignantly you'll want to run to your significant other and tell them how much you love them.

I was so excited to read this story because I thought it was a great idea to write about a groupie from her perspective. However, when I started reading the book, it took me a long time to even get into the plot. It started out very slow but finally gain momentum towards the middle. The beginning and ending are so different; it felt like I was reading a totally different book. Omar Tyree created some great characters but didn't spend too much time on them. The ending of \\"Diary of a Groupie\\" was a huge let down. I felt like there were too many unanswered questions and I wished he tied up some characters he left dangling.

The Sisters of APF exhibited the sexual quality I wish I had. The actual plot was okay. The story line and characters were good but nothing to really flip about. For me, the only memorable characters were Drayton and Olive. Drayton is someone I will dream about on those long lonely nights. Olive was super cool and Patricia was someone I could hang out with.  As Mary Ann's Resident Adviser, I thought Patricia would be more involved in her sexual transformation. However, it was Olive who gradually took Mary Ann under her wing. Although, I was expecting it, Mary Ann transformation from country bumpkin to Super Freak was shocking. I just didn't know she was going to be that freaky. There was some parts of the book that had me laughing out loud and other parts that had me blushing. Although I loved reading it, I have to be honest. I think the shock value really fuel this book. Without it, I doubt I would have enjoyed it has much. If, The Sister of APF, was a story about a sorority of  good, church going girls, I wouldn't even have picked up the book. Over all, I thought this was a fun book to read and I'm now an avid fan of Zane.	2003-10-27
