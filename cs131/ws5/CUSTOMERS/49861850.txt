School bookstores will have it cheaper, but still the material is outdated and not well written.  It the reader's intent is purely academic it is a good sourse of information and numbers, but will not enlighten them on the subject.	2004-10-31

The only thing I found lacking was more detail about Aquinas (Only a few pages is not enough).<br />Highly recommend this to either religious or nonreligious person.  One would definitely need to be interested in this time period though, because it is not a 'light' read, but not quite as 'heavy' as say Plato's Republic.	2004-04-12

This book is for one who has the bible open and is reading both at the same time, to compare the items one by one.<br />McKinsey's two books and &quot;Losing Fatith in Faith&quot; are the best books for debater to have read.	2003-11-10

It covers the story very well, and tries to go 'deep' into why Mason thought the way he did.  Covers Mason's history and the evidence that was uncovered by the author in his case against the man and his 'clan' of 'ladies'.    Not for the quaint at heart though, because there are areas within the book that are very detailed, but if one can get past the details of the muders the book will be quite rewarding.	2002-10-27

It shows the reasons that America hates Cuba.  That country is hated not because they turned to communism, but because every time the name Cuba is brought up in a conversation it brings to light the American corruption.  The country was full of drugs, prostitution and gambling among other American crime activity from the Spanish American War until Castro kicked us out.<br />Worth the money if you can find this valuable text.	2002-01-29

This book is excellent for anyone that wants a starter in the history of religion or actually freethought.<br /> -- Now finished, and am quite pleased with what I read.  I will gladly go to 'hell' with these great thinkers than go to a 'heaven' filled with people who blindly follow.  I also read Some Mistakes of Moses, another book that is a quick read like this one and highly recommended.<br />BUT this one is for the history or biography minded out there, it is not a literary work, it is a reference to certain people \\"wetting the palate\\" of the reader to go out and read more.	2002-01-26

When a text book is &quot;foggy&quot; on something this littly book has come through to clear up the subject in question.  The only down side to this is that most classes are taught with a separation between micro and macro.

I never have belived that a snake or a donkey could talk ... among other things that I previously knew about the religious nonsense.  But the over-whelming amount I learned from this man's scholarly book about the most famous lie in the world was well worth the money and more.  I plan to purchase his other book in the next few months, and I am sure that it will be well worth the money also.<br />And to the people that read this work and come back with comments that they are still christian, is only stronger proof of the level of brainwashing the church has done to it's people.	2001-10-10

It covers only about two chapters on the actuall time of World War 2; but that is because it starts with this man's family history and leads the reader through the history like a history book should.<br />History doesn't just happen it takes time for events to unfold and Cornwell does an exceptial job at telling the STORY in this man's history, proving that he was HITLER'S POPE.<br />The reason for my title, to the review, is the part where the Vatican (vow of poverty?) had around $7 million to &quot;play&quot; with in their investments in American corporations (7 million dollars - that's a lot of money in today's terms let alone the 1930's).<br />Excellent for both the Christian and Non-Christian alike, purely nonbiased in the approach!!!!!!!	2001-04-05
