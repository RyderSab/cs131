Passion becomes a destructive force by the time all is said and done, yet afterwards, a rarity among Hardy stories, a happy ending does emerge. Bathsheba (a fascinating name to pronounce) is caught up in feelings she can't contain, which leads to both the quiet love of Gabriel (who lets nature takes its long silent course) and the future madness of Boldwood, whose own desire virtually ruins him. Throw in the 3rd party distraction of soldier Frank Troy and you have a near soap opera like quadrangle that pretty much determines the fates of all the main characters. You get a strong sense of farming life here- as sales, native farm hands, crops and weather patterns each come into play as every day hurdles and absurdities. Hardy really knows how to make every landscape a looming aspect of all his novels. You can almost inhale the scenery here.	2005-08-31

As he takes his most likable male character in Jude and basically ruins him against his 2 least enjoyable female leads in Arabell and Sue. Sue more than anything is infuriatingly fickle and will either make you yell at the book or wish for her early exit. She's a real struggle to cozy up to and yet she becomes the voice for Hardy to express his disgust with social conventions and public morality and what is right and what isn't. etc... Probably contains his harshest plot twists. And as well, his most damning indictments against a rigid world dominated by rules and tradition. Jude is at once trapped and alive with his choices but eventually even his last ounce of love for Sue does him in. Since she's enough to drive even a saint to madness. Hardy really made her as exasperating as possible. Jude becomes a brave soul just for putting up with her... Each chapter takes place in a different location, perhaps to symbolize the characters' indecision. The more than unstable ones who can't seem to make up their minds. PS: a pig killing sequence is especially disturbing.	2005-08-31

Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written.	2005-08-31

Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue... Supporting characters are as vivid as the main ones... This may be Hardy's most complete and upsetting story. He really puts the players (thus the audience) thru the ringer.	2005-08-31

The landscape here both traps and releases the people inside it. Eustacia is one of Hardy's best heroines, vulnerable and cunning within minutes. And part of the Hardy pattern where tragedy invades before the end of the story; tragedy, as he writes it, that is often accidental rather than forced. (the forced tragedy usually follows the accidental one.) Clym and Damon may be the 2 main sources of Eustacia's downfall, but she brings on her own fate, so to speak, by remaining disillusioned with where she is. Key other players bissect the main characters in equally helpful and not so helpful ways. The main \\"character\\" still remains Edgon Heath, the harsh, often beautiful setting, where everyone is almost destined to be doomed...	2005-08-31

Long time in between this and Delusions of Grandma. Whereas her other 3 novels were about survival and relationships, the survival portions of this story are often harrowing. You can see inside the bi-polar mind here to such a degree, you become amazed it can be articulated on such witty terms. Sad and hilarious within seconds. Stands up well next to other crack up tales like I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and even the movie Frances. Hollywood loves to chew some of its members to pieces, doesn't it? Makes you seriously wonder why anyone would want to be famous? PS: the only nitpicky part I didn't enjoy was that poem Suzanne wrote while tripping in Mexico.

After a brief prologue (explaining the current  state of the world), the memoirs take over the book and create an environment both instantly insane and memorabley accurate. Lem was always the funniest of the sci fi writers- he makes you think, the same time he causes you to laugh out loud. (it's like Kafka mixed with the Marx Brothers.)

Read his works first, then read this, then read Hellman's plays. You'll feel as though you've spent time with them over a life. (Lillian has 2 further books of memoirs to complete her trilogy.)

The characters make it biting, strong and unforgettable, freaks and weirdos alike... Nick and Nora Charles are 2 of the most perfect literary creations in all of fiction. Hollywood cleaned them up a little and made them classy social lushes, but in their original written form, they're cynical, world weary wise acres. Their heavy drinking only adds to the book's appeal. Dashielle dedicated it to his long time love Lillian Hellman, as she, in turn, dedicated a few of her plays to him. The Maltese Falcon is the most famous of Hammett's works, The Daine Curse, his most complicated, Red Harvest, his most violent, The Glass Key, his most bitter. But the Thin Man is the most entertaining. You'll feel like reading it with a bottle of booze at your side. <br />	2005-03-16

This one puts all the naysayers and Clinton detractors  to test who claimed Bill did \\"nothing\\" to fight terrorism, when, in fact, he took it very seriously. (You'll see how much by the time he writes of his second term.) A rare political autobiography that makes politics sound almost hopeful. You begin to notice how glaringly different Clinton's administration was from the current one.  (Bill's was full of more compassion and promise, in my humble, subjective opinion, which all but seem lost today.) Over 900 pages fly by so quickly, you forget about the length and stay glued to the narration. It's like Clinton is sitting there talking to you from the written word. A few, short, dull stretches here and there could have been trimmed (Hillary is less verbose) but they don't weaken the book. They merely slow it down a little.Forgiveable lapses overall. Bill is too fascinating to stay boring beyond one of two paragraphs. <br />	2005-03-16

This read will make you feel  a bit \\"closer\\" to her,  since she reveals some nice human touches among her many travels, like how it felt to send Chelsea off to college, and how insecure she's always been about her hair styles.I finished the book  amazed by the many accomplishments Hillary has achieved, as well as a sense of admiration for all she has overcome. The Clintons were loved and reviled simultaneously, so your enjoyment of her life story will depend on which camp you were part of: her followers or her detractors. Since America lived thru her story as well, anyone alive during the recent and the not so recent past will recognize themselves among her struggles and victories. The country was at a fine peak of peace, prosperity and compassion during the Clinton years, it's a shame it ended so abruptly.	2004-10-24

Marion is one of Irving's best creations, especially in the first section, which is also the most heartbreaking and memorable section.

The first piece about a woman who kills her husband made me think of many uncomfortable things... and how the murder itself becomes  the symbolic loss of a whole country. You can picture that burning Volkswagon long after you put down the book... While each essay is an homage of some sort, as well as an elegy, I still think the final one Goodbye to all That captures Didion's style more memorabley and sadly than the others. New York City as she describes it becomes almost mournful and bittersweet. Doesn't everyone who's been to NY remember their first time there? A fine collection of original reporting.	2003-12-27

James always wrote very piercing stories of moral and romantic conflict and this one, vague and hard as the langauge can be, is no exception. Despite the narrative's thickness, you can't helped but be awed by how a master can re-arrange the English tongue to sound this beautiful. You will feel every inch of being in Paris here, and, as well, the frustration and confusion of every lost soul in the story. Even the scared conformist characters are vividly drawn. Another amazing effort by a writer who isn't always easy to dissect. Requires more than a brief sit thru. Stick with it, you will feel like you've lived the book yourself.	2003-12-18

Tyler has always been a gifted and genuine writer, with a great ear for dialogue, but she tops all her other efforts here. I thought this was a fine piece of work from the first sentence, and the final party for Poppy had me both teary eyed and smiling.

(Farfetched only in that Poirot wants to retire after 12 cases and miraculously finds 12 in which to do so.) Miss Canaby in the first tale reappears in the Flock of Geryon, which later on: became the basis for a longer version in the novel The Pale Horse. (Some elements are nearly the same in short story and novel form.) The Erymanthanian Boar is set in a remote ski lodge on top of a tall mountain, which was the same location as the 1960's film version of Christie's Ten Little Indians. The writers even used the broken tramcar premise in the screenplay, perhaps inspired by or lifted from this piece. It's one of Poirot's more violent cases. Finally, The Learnean Hydra is almost an exact duplicate of the story the Cornish Mystery from the Underdog collection of stories, proving that maybe Christie might have written way too much in her long career, or simply liked to expand on her previous works. She was more prolific in her day than Danielle Steele is in this one.	2003-03-26

As stated in another review, the Cornish Mystery is identical to another tale in the Labors of Hercules (with a few slim changes)while the Plymouth Express is a very close prelude to Christie's longer story (in novel form) The Mystery of the Blue Train (again with almost identical similarities.) Some of the tales are in third person then abruptly turn to first person when Col. Hastings takes over to round out the remaining adventures. Overall: a nice, diverting addition to the Christie library, if only to compare the stories to their different versions. P.S> The Submarine Plans was also published in Murder on the Mews under the title the Incredible Theft; again with some slight modifications.	2003-03-26

Symbolism is on every page, with the underlying theme of self loathing evident beneath the many changing narratives. Morrison can sometimes be pretentious, but she always leaves the reader questioning the world around them. After reading this a second time, it is easy to see why weird celebrities like Micheal Jackson can grow up to hate their own skin color so destructively. Here's a good example of how such a possibility can begin. The scene where Pecola tries to overcome her shame buying three pieces of candy is as painful and heartbreaking as any passage in a Richard Wright novel. Before Alice Walker's The Color Purple came along, this story was  already out there, as part of an all too slim and overlooked genre: the black female experience. Morrison deserves awards for all her books, if only by refusing to shy away from life's brutalities. Disturbing moments in a fictional story are nothing compared to the disturbing histories of many black americans, and it's important that their lives be given a voice. In fact many voices, which Toni has always been skilled at putting to paper. She is truly a gifted talent. If you're going to write about heavy subjects, you can't gloss over them to make the reader comfortable. That would be a cop out to both the truth and the creative process. Let's hope with under less than ten published books Morrison still has more stories inside her. The human race and literature need her.	2003-03-14

Very funny.<BR>The best piece is the Lonely God, about a non descript museum idol that brings two lost souls together.  Quite moving and touching...

Hints of black magic, some elderly women who may be witches and talks of death thru telepathy, may remind the reader of an old Scooby Doo episode, but this one has no meddling kids or a talking dog. One of Agatha's more entertaining cast of characters, however, includes the daffy novelist Adrien Oliver, who's been in several other stories, as well. She provides the amateur sleuths with a rather significant clue involving hair loss. Told in both first and third person narration to present an overall treatment of the mystery, the big twist is typical A.C., tho' if you've read enough of her stories, you might be able to guess the identity of the killer.

The set up is quite impressive, with the floating admiral of the title found sailing along in an abandonned boat with a dagger in him, which is all explained away by the clever and quite natural conclusion. Despite going on about tide flows and boat paintings and rope cuttings, the characters to this crafty piece are all quite believable, considering several writers made them move and speak. All is well by the end and a satisfying summary to the events beforehand is smoothly explained, so you can skip past the silly alternate outcomes the authors each come up with in an unneccessary, sort of epilogue. They add nothing to the main story but a lot of what ifs. (That said, Christie's solution of the murderer in drag is hilarious...) P.S. Some rather foolish stereotypes can be found in the narrative which doesn't distract from the story. They're just there, like a disturbing sign of the times.	2003-02-15

The most riveting aspects of the tale (outside the revolution and the tortured bonds between the characters) happen but briefly on the water. Comparisons to Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness are inevitable though this one stands out on its own, provided the over detailed writing doesn't off put the casual reader. Once again, as with every Conrad piece, you have to read carefully, and be on the look out for abrupt changes in time, place and thought, which he purposely intertwines to expose a larger picture: a rather effective way to unleash the English language, considering that it wasn't Conrad's original native tongue. Title character Nostromo stands out as the key tormented romantic \\"hero\\" but the rest of the abundant cast each have their dramatic moments near and around, and before and after him as well. JC weaves all their lives into the same colorful pattern. The silver mine by the time all is finished has power over each of them, a very hypnotic and manipulative symbol of greed and loss. Don Martin Decoud, next to Nostromo himself, makes an impression as the story's most heartbreaking character. He becomes the most tragic person in the book.	2003-01-10

This reminded me of her later work The Clocks, which also had an effective beginning and got even more complicated than it needed to by the time it was over. To make up for its flaws, Christie does, however, put characters together you really wouldn't think would get together. She always was brilliant playing with audience expectations. PS: Even if you can't see the killer before Poirot does, you may pick up on a few clues in the same clever way, so the story isn't a total bust.	2003-01-10

The disharmony right below the surface of his fragile, awkward family life finally explodes right about the time he sends his frail mother off to live by herself; the even bigger plot explosion to follow becomes a catalyst for the rest of the story's major events. Conrad's narrative style is often so dense you may lose track of what's going on, but you never lose track of the finely etched characters, whose motives here all cross paths over the same sad (and ultimately pointless) episode. Patient readers will be lulled into a heartbreaking tale whose story elements eerily parallel the terrorist schemes of today. But then again, terrorism isn't exactly a modern day nightmare. (It's been going on throughout history.) Overall, the heavy, thick writing magicially gives way to some very memorable and forlorn people, who never do get to realize their dreams. The clash of law and lawlessness, morality and indifference, and love and family loyalty, feature strongly on practically every page.	2003-01-10

You almost can't wait for the victim to be done away with at the same time, you feel for their murderer. Not easy to pull off ( making the killer sympathetic) but AC does it flawlessly. This ranks right up there in her top twenty.	2002-11-13

Perhaps the best end of the world story in 20th popular fiction, it's filled with a boat load of memorable characters. (Tom Cullen the mentally challenged man with the mind of a child remains my favorite). Stick with the longer 1000 plus page rewrite for more depth and insight into the cast's motives. You won't easily forget this entertaining and often overly wicked epic. For a large book, the story moves quite fast, tho' you may want to savour the experience over a satisfying two week stretch, to really let it sink into you. An amazing piece of work in what should be just a mindless genre...	2002-10-26

A real fine twist ending will reverse every notion you may have had for the characters. Poirot is at his amusing, determined best here; his one flaw being he cares too much. It almost costs him the case. Hastings as usual narrates the story in his own daft and befuddled way. Hercule enjoys toying with him. Sort of like the way Christie must have enjoyed toying with her readers.	2002-09-10

Christie writes nicely during the court room sequences and the story moves briskly, but Poirot is almost an after thought here. He's not in a great chunk of the plot. Admire for the people dotting the landscape. Agatha has had much better resolutions in her long career. I was hoping for a much different ending.	2002-09-05

Both heartbreaking and in places, disturbing, nonetheless, still rewarding reading. Lessing is more famous for the Golden Notebook, but these showcase her broad range and near flawless gift for making characters come to life.

I think the final pages of this story are some of the saddest ever written in literature. And yes, you can call someone's memoirs literature.<BR>While the fine film version is based on three books, this is the definitive, haunting one which expertly, more than any visual medium, describes what it's like to be possessed by a place. More than Blixen being in Africa, this is more like Africa being in Blixen.	2002-08-20

I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this book on here. The intermingling of the classes, plus as well, how the poor and rich come to radically change both their views and positions in the world, makes for fascinating reading. James' writing style is always hypnotic and will stay with you long after you put down a chapter. Flowing as it does rather elegantly, in fluid motion.<BR>The title character is a very complex heroine. You don't know whether to cheer for her or hiss at her. A woman with her intentions in the right place, yet as well, someone who thinks nothing of discarding close confidantes. She's an interesting mix of dichotomies. Hyacinth is both aptly wary of her and beguiled by her in the same breath.<BR>Not quite as powerful as his latest works, still, for fans of great literature and ideas, this is a fine way to spend a few idle weeks.	2002-03-26

Memorable characters and vivid descriptions are on every page. Irving's second best creation next to the timeless The World According to Garp (another modern classic). The equally excellent movie adaption covers less time than this (Melony and Angel are absent in the film), but the book can be savored for a week or two like all fine works of literature. Try to drag the experience out for more than 6 or 7 days to fully feel the story and the people. You can almost see them sitting next to you in real life. One of the strongest arguments out there to keep abortion legal.

It's quite realistically scary, too, in that King makes simple every day things, like  breakfast cereal and a child's toy closet, seem menacing. Probably his best characters for sheer immediate indentification, since they're well drawn and fragile enough to be totally believable. A heartbreaking and very blunt ride thru the suburbs, where, alas, not even the family dog (or the family car for that matter) is safe. Note the clever references to King's other work, the Dead Zone, that sort of tap into the kid's childhood nightmares.	2002-02-03

More disturbing and graphic than the fine film version, the violent scenes here are more repellent, altho the riding lawn mower encounter had me laughing with over the top delight. Did King go too far here? probably, but you can't fault his imagination or his wicked ability to create real characters out of the most extreme circumstances. Despite his penchant for the cheesey pop culture reference, this is still a delicious little treat that will leave you a bit drained in the end. Where else can you go after a blow torch and an electric knife? How about a romance heroine covered by killer bees?

And who would want an annoying voice over narration explaining a character's motives on screen? The novel is certainly more brutal than the film and the Sam Loomis character is given more to do, even offering the final answers to Norman's whacked pysche. The house and the motel seem to be the stars of the movie, but the book is more Norman, and truly makes you see the world from his screwed up perspective. A definite must read for anyone who likes the slasher/killer genre or anyone just wanting to see what the great motion picture was based on. Probably one of the best horror novels of the 20th century, you can toss this off in a day or two, depending on your time schedule.	2002-01-31

The trick to enjoying this one, if you can use a verb like enjoying to describe it, is to simply let it flow and seep into you. It is like Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon in that, there's so much knowledge stuffed into the narrative you'll never be able to grasp every word... And that's okay. You don't have to. It would probably take you decades anyhow. Just sit back and take your time with this one and somehow, it will become clear to you, the same time it's confusing the hell out of you. A definite challenge between love and hate and both of them will win out by the end. But you will feel rewarded when you're finished, if only to say: &quot;Yeh, I actually got thru the whole thing... Finnegan's Wake, which is really mindboggling, may be more of an experiment but this book is the more satisfying work. Don't let it discourage you. It wasn't meant to be read in one week, or even one month. Personally, I read passages of it in different locations, and somehow, that actually helped...	2002-01-18

Her leading heroine Anne is sympathetic and enjoyable from the beginning and her chemistry with the mysterious title character is the stuff of fine love stories.

The obvious is made not quite so obvious until you realize, it was very obvious after all. Fun reading contains some of Christie's most clever plotting.

A really good story for readers who like to listen to characters speak and recall their history. Plot seeking others might want to delve into Agatha's more exciting yarns for suspense.

Compared to her other story collections, this one isn't great, but it's still highly readable. Try her Witness for the Prosecution collection, too and the shorter Jane Marple pieces.

But then Christie gets over complicated and tries to wrap things up too quickly and the story concludes on a confusing note. The characters however are all unique especially the ones in the neighborhood where the dead body was found but they're mostly there to distract you away from the real killer, whose motives seem overly complex. <BR>Poirot is regulated to background status here but as usual, he provides the most humor and enjoyment. Read for him and the supporting cast. The outcome sadly never reaches the same level as the great beginning.	2001-10-20

The final whereabouts of the Heart Afire ruby were a bit vague and I'm not sure how it ended up with who it did, plus the identity of the murderer is easy to guess, as well. In this one in particular, Poirot seems grumpy and pushy and in some passages, downright surly and rude. I didn't find this to be one of his more riveting cases. Murder on the Orient Express uses the train setting much more cleverly and even Miss Marple's 4:15 from Paddington was more involving. This, I hate to say, because I love everything Christie writes, came off rather flat. The characters aren't really interesting, either	2001-10-16

The ending is vintage Christie and vintage Poirot in one. The humor interweaves nicely with some very creative death scenes. Try to overlook the Asian stereotypes as a sign of the times.

The drowning of children shouldn't be funny but here, I think Agatha was in a dark, black comedy mood. Besides, the 2 victims are rather obnoxious... so it makes it more humorous. While you'll guess the whodunit right away (how can you not?), she does throw in a few twists at the end that only Poirot could have unravelled. Not a great book, but not bad either. After all, Christie did write it and she seldom wrote a bad story in her career. Good stuff, as one reader mentioned, to curl up with in autumn weather.	2001-10-04
US	49200911	RU8UAU1GKZAV1	0061003816	397579205	Destination Unknown	Books	4	2	2	N	N	very involving story	Another one of Christie's espionage potboilers contains one of her best female protagonists. Hillary Craven starts out a tragic figure and becomes by the end, a clever, determined and complex character. Slight comparisons to Passenger to Frankfurt, which expands on the disappearing scientist thread more chillingly. As usual, Agatha tops off the adventure with some nice final twists.	2001-10-04

The only thing that upset me was the sort of muddled ending. It felt rushed and hurried. She should have left the mystery open with no conclusion. That might have worked better. It was nice to see Mr Robinson again and his trail of money theories. If you don't expect the usual murder mystery, jump into this on different terms and enjoy the excellent narrative style and as usual, the more than fascinating characters. That grotesque Charlotte woman was a real kick in the pants	2001-09-22

The multi layered story becomes more and more complex but it is livened up greatly by Tommy and Tuppence's witty banter, between themselves and also when they're scolding their manservant, Albert, who has been in every one of their books. I wish Christie had written more tales with this couple. Their adventures always seemed more realistic and possible. This one most of all will leave you reeling. It's final twist is a doozie.	2001-09-17
US	49200911	R36BX20KYWNGWJ	0553213288	219890586	Moll Flanders	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A great read	One of the all time best works in the annals of literature, this highly involving and rich comic novel has perhaps the best heroine of any classic book. What a great narrative style, if not altogether a good role model; still, you can hardly blame Moll for all the trouble she gets into. Defoe really gets into the mind of this memorable female protagonist, so deftly, you will sympathsize with her from the first page. A truly sublime work of art.

Every story moves smoothly and is satisfying throughout til their expert conclusions. I really like her Tommy and Tuppence books. It's too bad she only wrote 5 of them, but this one I think is her finest. The 2 meld well together and even argue delightfully. A must addition to any Agatha collection. You will not be disappointed.	2001-09-04

A maddening, often hysterical odyssey thru one warped writer's overknowledgable head, stuffed to the breaking point by things you won't one one whit about. Try not to let the mammath attack to the senses slow you down any, even when you feel like putting the book under the bed and swearing you'll never touch it again; force yourself anyways to reach the vivid, truly haunting last scene. The main characters are wickedly drawn, even lost as they are beneath Pynchon's amazingly labryinthine narration. I have no idea what this story was about, and I doubt too many people will, but that should never stop a reader from enjoying a good literary ride. Or in this case, a wild car chase in the dark...

Actually, sections of this trilogy are howlingly funny, especially Molloy, easily the most accessible of the trio. Malone Dies and The UnNamable both start out coherently, then drift onwardly into a sea sick like eulogy which might drive a reader mad. Stick with it for the language however and let yourself wander along with Beckett even if you find yourself on the brink of collapse.

And quite easy to follow along, if you delve closely into the language. King Lear was more complex but the theme of callous ambition still rings true today, with elements of the supernatural thrown in for good measure, such as Banquo's ghost and those sublime cackling old witches. Best enjoyed if you just mouth the words out loud, or better yet, see a production of it lived out on stage. The action is fast, and really, you can read the whole thing in probably about an hour.	2001-06-25

Tommy and Tuppence have a really sweet relationship. I think Christie just wanted to end their history like she did with Miss Marple and Poirot, both whose last stories were much more involving. This one was about fascism and that angle really held my attention... T&T were always more into espionage than true murder mysteries. Here, they've stayed true to their characters... And their dog Hannibal was a nice touch... Let's remember this was her final book, and to have such a complicated plot from a woman in her 80's is amazing... I never found it dull or confusing. It's mostly about the past and how governments still til this day continue to bury their secrets... The fat yellow man Robinson explains all this before it's over... Personally I thought the whole story was fascinating...	2001-01-30

I don't know if Thomas Harris felt pressured to finish this or not, but the whole thing seems rushed. I cannot believe  anyone would even attempt to make this gross out story into a movie. I was  physically ill at the end, literally. The subtle complexities of Harris's  other novels are sadly missing here, as if his sole intention this time was  to be as grotesque as possible. Lots of the elements work superbly, like  the revenge plot involving Mason and the whole sequence in Florence Italy,  which is very well crafted, but the rest of the book falls a little short  of expectations. Clarice and Hannibal have lost a lot of their depth here.  I think maybe Harris could have delved a lot more skillfully into their  histories. As a result, you will remember the gorey climax much more than  anything else in the book, which is a real shame because the characters are  authentic and believable, especially the continuation of the male nurse  Barney and his interactions with Mason's butch sister Margot, a subplot I  found by the way much more intriguing than the main one...	2000-07-09
