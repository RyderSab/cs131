Easy to read and made me laugh out loud at times.  The idea of an underwear buyer turning bounty hunter is in itself intriguing.  Evanovich makes it work well and bring plenty of laughs with her main character Stephanie Plum and her whacky grandmother adds sidebars full of laughs. She is descriptive of street life in New Jersey and the neighborhoods that she writes about come to life.  I will pick up book two and continue to read the series until it runs out of steam (which most series seem to do, but I hope this one lasts a bit).  I hope Evanovich can keep it fresh because I enjoyed the quick, easy and fun read.	2005-09-03

It gave a lot of information about different political issues of the day.  It talks about how our government has failed to evolve with the times in the way it gathers, processes and disseminates information.  He also explains how this flaw keeps our government from doing what's best for us the American public.  As can be expected this book is written from a conservative view point, and many of the proposed solutions would never be accepted by those who are inclined to be more liberal or extremely conservative.  This book will have something to offer those that are moderate to slightly conservative.  Most of these proposals are rather ambitious and will most likely never come to fruition because it would require those in power to relinquish some of that power.  Considering the current state of American politics I can't foresee that ever happening.  This book gives some background and offers solutions.  It is good for generating a political discussion and framing it around proposed solutions instead of the constant blame game that dominates the headlines and other books.  While some of his solutions will require complete overhauls of many governmental programs it should spark thought about changing them instead of simply tweaking them, as has been our government's policy for quite some time now.  I believe entering the arena of political ideas and sparking debate is truly what Mr. Gingrich intended with this book and I believe it will do that for everyone who reads it.  It is a quick read but gave me plenty to read about and discuss with friends and relatives that are interested in politics.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American Politics and how our government works and ask them to at least consider what he proposes and work from there.	2005-08-18

It was such a long work and I felt needlessly so.  While I agree with earlier reviewers that one doesn't read Edding's for literary genius, I do expect the books to be well thought out and entertaining.  Going into this book you know the outcome if you read the Belgariad.  That makes it hard to inject any suspense into the work, which meant that it needed to be overcome with skillful writing and plot twists.  I didn't feel that there was any of this in this work.  When a situation headed towards a difficult problem the \\"necessity\\" or \\"Garion's friend\\" bailed everyone out conveniently.  I just didn't find this work to be very imaginative and below Edding's standard in the first five books of the Belgariad.<br /><br />This book is like the movie sequel that didn't need to be made.  Does Smoky and the Bandit III ring a bell with anyone?	2005-08-06

I did, however, find it an interesting read that had some issues that are still valid in the political realm right now.<br /><br /> While reading the other reviews, I found it amazing the amount of emotion that this book unleashed.  Unfortunately the people using this forum as a political discussion arena both proved some of the arguments made in this book and gave no real insight into the book.<br /><br /> Without getting into a political discussion, anyone reading this book that knows anything about Sean Hannity knows that they will be getting a conservative view of the world in these pages.  What I liked most of this book is that it put all of the political issues into context.  Too often I hear people discussing politics as individual issues and never placing them into cause and effect relationships with other issues.  For example, there is talk about the environment and gas prices.  People will argue various reasons why gas prices continue to climb and blame \\"big oil\\".  However, no one wants to build refineries in the United States to process the crude oil we have.  These issues are intertwined and cannot be separated.  Mr. Hannity connects the dots whether the reader likes them or not.<br /><br /> If you're looking for a book with a completely neutral political agenda, this is not it.  However, it does present a truly conservative argument that is well thought out and can give a reader an intelligent insight into the conservative thought process.  If your going to rant on about the \\"Right Wing Fascists\\" then don't read this book, but if you want to see how the conservatives have been and will continue to make their arguments for more personal freedom and responsibility, then read on.  Mr. Hannity is true to the conservative cause in his basic core beliefs.  He presents the issues that still effect us today with the conservative view that will help conservatives, moderates and liberals understand the arguments of the day whether you agree with him or not.<br /><br /> All in all I have to say this book still has some relevance even though some of the players have changed (i.e. Tom Daschle).  A person engaged in a true political debate would want to read both sides of the story and this book presents the conservative view as coherently as I have seen it before.liberals understand the arguments of the day whether you agree with him or not.  <br /> All in all I have to say this book still has some relevance even though some of the players have changed (i.e. Tom Daschle).

Mark Levin has written a well-researched book pointing out some disturbing issues with the federal courts in America.  The logic of some of the decisions that the Supreme Court has made is mind-boggling.  While it is obvious to those that know of Mark Levin he comes down very hard on the judiciary of the United States.  It is very difficult to see any consistency of the rulings made at times during our history.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that Levin's book muddies the issues and rulings, but I have to whole-heartedly disagree.  I think this book brings to the forefront some of the issues facing us as we head into a time where a Supreme Court Justice could be nominated.  The reviewers that disagree that there is any judicial activism going on please explain some of the contradictions made by the court.  Free speech is not protected when talking about political candidates but child porn is?  This makes absolutely no sense to me.  Others accuse Levin of only calling decisions activist when he personally disagrees with them.  Perhaps he disagrees with them because they are based on \\"liberal\\" interpretation of the constitution of the United States.  I find that people that prefer this \\"liberal\\" interpretation have very little knowledge of what the framers intended and what the Constitution actually says.  Mark Levin has no such gaps in his knowledge.  The author does not like the decisions made by the Supreme Court that the author attacks because they poorly reasoned decisions that go in contrast with the Constitution.  There are clear lines of authority in our government and the Supreme Court has consistently and increasingly crossed those lines.<br /><br />The Congress needs to stand up to the judiciary and take back the legitimate powers that it holds by limiting what the judiciary can rule on.  I don't necessarily agree with term limits for judges because we would be right back to partisan politics when the judge came up for re-appointment.  But the Congress can and should determine what the courts may rule on.  The government is supposed to serve the people of the United States, not the liberal or conservative fringe groups (which rarely go this route, but conceivably could) that create cases to get the courts to rule in their favor.<br /><br />Others have made the argument that the courts don't make laws then only reinforce them or strike them down.  If you believe this to be the case then your not paying attention to what's been going on over the years.  It's a technicality that they don't write the statutes but they control them by the precise wording of their rulings.  Look at the major court cases mentioned in Men in Black.  If at the time of Roe V. Wade the majority of American's were against abortion and the courts don't write law, how did we end up with legalized abortion in all cases in America?  There was no way to give the people what they want?  The legislators couldn't write some laws that limited abortion?  They can't because the courts have decided that it is ALWAYS LEGAL even though that is not their job.  Just as reviewers have written that the author calls judges activist because he doesn't like their rulings, judges cannot strike down laws because they disagree with the laws or the morals behind the laws.<br /><br />This is a great book and a must read that should shape the debate over the judiciary for years to come.But the Congress can and should determine what the courts may rule on.

This is yet another excellent work by Mr. Pressfield.  While it would be unfair to compare anything to Gates of Fire, it is because of that book that I continue to read Steven Pressfield and with few exceptions I continue to be richly rewarded.  In this latest novel the author transports us into the mind of one of the most interesting and difficult figures in history to explain.  An earlier review chastens Mr. Pressfield for taking a romantic view of Alexander the Great and what drove him to conquest.  I have to disagree wholeheartedly!  If there wasn't any romanticism attached to Alexander than who but the historians would care to read or write about him.  It is these romantic notions that draw us back to Alexander continually.  Mr. Pressfield presents an Alexander that truly believes in what he is doing.  He struggles when difficult decisions are made.  The same earlier review says that Pressfield's Alexander is a benevolent warlord.  There are times that Alexander comes across as that, but there are times when he has entire villages massacred as the only way to fight a guerilla war.  He kills no less than three of his Macedonian Generals.  I would argue that Alexander would be an incredible psychological study and Mr. Pressfield has brought that complicated psyche alive in these pages with his riveting prose.  Let this Alexander be a sort of romantic figure.  There is nothing wrong with this.  Read it and get lost in the mind a military genius that borders on insanity.  It has been said before, but it is true.  Steven Pressfield is a master wordsmith and I look forward to his next novel.	2005-02-24

The book is written in a very easy to follow format and he explores the personal side of leadership.  He presents some very altruistic ideas the sound very good, however, aren't always practical in the real world.  This book would have received a higher rating for me also if Mr. Bennis would have refrained from all the political commentary throughout the beginning of his book.  His repeated support for a former president while being less than flattering of the current president put too much of a political overtone in the beginning and really turned me off.  It wouldn't matter if I agreed with Mr. Bennis or not, it simply didn't have a place in what would have otherwise been a very good book.	2004-08-19

I really enjoyed the concept of following Robert the Bruce through his consolidation of power.  The Scottish Monarchy is a fascinating story and one in which I have ordered a history book about to read the whole story.  What I didn't like about this book was that the battle between good and evil was too simplistic.  When situations got bad for Bruce or the Templars there was no real action or plot to save them, the Templars just prayed about it and some divine intervention would take care of the problem. I simply didn't like the fact that it was that easy.  I guess that I was looking for more drama or action from the divine forces.  A demon in rings doing mans bidding in a war against the Templars (I would have thought the church as a whole would have been a better target for this concept).  The Templar order falling apart from within was interesting and maybe I don't know enough about their real history to appreciate their treatment in this work.  This was not my favorite piece of historical fiction.	2004-02-09

The book was filled with vivid characters that made me laugh.  It included a dragon that wasn't quite right, and alcoholic and some bad guys.  Seems simple doesn't it? Well this author has created a world with it's own rules.  All of the above characters are woven into a tapestry that takes a comical look at a society of laws.  There is a message in there somewhere and when I finish wiping the tears of laughter from my eyes I'll figure it out.

I enjoyed this book very much and thought the main character Olivia was done wonderfully.  The action and the struggle with the Knight Hospitlar's lust and feelings for the vampire were tastefully written.  I was easily taken up in the story and enjoyed Olivia's personality, wishing for her to get safely to Rome.  I wish that I hadn't picked this book up at random and knew more of the background.  Even though I was essentially reading mid-story I enjoyed this book a lot.  Olivia is not your typical vampire and I wouldn't classify this book as horror at all.  It was nice historical fiction.  Olivia is an intelligent woman with a fascinating personality.  The world around her is in total chaos and she longs to return home.  Her trip home and entanglements with the Knight Hospitlar and others made for a quick and enjoyable read.  I will look forward to reading more of Ms. Yarbro's books in the near future.	2004-02-09

How could anything revolving the story about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce be anything but good.  I didn't even mind the battle between christian and pagan religions.  It just seemed that whenever the Templars got in trouble they pulled out their Celtic stone, said some prayers and all was well.  I was given the second book and will attempt to slog my way through it as I travel, however, I am so far not impressed 57 pages into it.  I wish that the execution of this story and plot could have been done better as the idea was fantastic.  I enjoyed some of the historical points of the book, but as written in earlier reviews they were repeated entirely too many times!

Pressfield uses a battle squire in captivity to tell the story of the Battle of Thermopylae.  From the moment I picked this book up, I had difficulty putting it down.  I was instantly captivated by the POW's tale.  Pressfield involves us not only in the captives life, but of those around him.  He gives background information and a life to his characters.  While reading this book you could picture the Spartan King Leonidas, and pull for him to crush the Persians.  His battle details were graphic, yet done in a way that made this one of the best battle books ever written.  Pressfield get's all the senses involved when describing the horrors of ancient warfare.  This book takes you through some brief history of Sparta and the characters, and is well worth the read.  My only advice is buy it in hardback, because you will read it again!!!!	2003-02-06

It was a great read and a book that I struggled to put down.  I will order the Hardcover so I can keep this book around.  It has some idealistic leadership scenario's in it, which may be a bit altruistic, but fit the message Pressfield was going for when writing about this epic battle in Western Civilization.  The character Xeo was well developed and an interesting man.  I never really figured out why Pressfield continued to write about Xeo's search for his cousin. I am not sure that it added anything to the story. I did, however, find the view of Spartan women interesting.  As a military man myself, I had to wonder if that is how my mother and wife think when I get deployed.  This book sparked my interests in the Spartans to the point that I have continued to read historical information on them daily.  While Pressfield misses some of the more horrific items of Spartan life, I still found this novel an incredible read.  I hope that his future writings are as captivating.  This book is highly recommended.	2003-01-08

It takes on a broad time period that involves a whole lot of history. Alcibiades is a fascinating character as is Pommo.  These mens lives that are intertwined so remarkably that it takes two narrators to tell this story.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that reads historical fiction.  If Gates of Fire it that much better than this one I can't wait to read it.  Maybe I'll just give it 5 stars now and not bother with a review.

This book educated me on the state of the baseball economy.  I am looking at the current labor negotiations with a different perspective now.  I feel it is a more informed prosepective.  I think that some of the proposals in this book are a bit altruistic for the money grabbing players and owners to try.  For example, the players have already said that they will not accept any form of salary cap or floor.  They are acting as if they are in a free economy.  Considering the United States doesn't have a completely unregulated economy, I find this very arrogant. While I can see the merits of Bob Costas' plan, I just don't think I will live to see the day the players will accept it. After all, it is 2002 and 25 Million doesn't go quite as far as it did in the 90's.<br />I love his &quot;3-0&quot; plan to eliminate the wild card.  I believe that it would restore the feel to the pennant races that fans remember.  I liked his idea of moving the Houstan franchise to the American League (although eliminating the two Florida based teams would be acceptable) to create balance leagues makes sense.  I also enjoy the concept of an unbalanced schedule.<br />While this plan is very altruistic, it does serve as a starting point.  I am not so naive as to believe that the owners and players haven't seen it, nor understand it.  I just think that the almighty dollar is king of baseball and will continue to be until some sort of comprehensive plan is developed, whether it be Mr. Costas' or someone elses.<br />This book is straight forward, educational and easy to read. I recommend it highly to any baseball fan that wishes to make some sense of the chaos in baseball today.	2002-08-26

When she began to ask questions about why Catholics did something, or how that belief was formed and I couldn't answer her with anything more than, &quot;that's how I was raised,&quot; I bought this book and began to brush up on my religion.  This book touches on all ascpects of the Catholic Faith.  While it isn't a deep theolgical book (and I didn't want it to be), it does touch on how Catholics relate to the world around them, the mass and other religions.  It even has a chapter on the problems that the church faces in the 3rd millenium.  It has assisted me in answering a lot of my wife's questions and refreshed me on some of the items I had forgotten since my grade school days.  I would recommend this book to anyone becoming Catholic, or simply wanting to know a little about what Catholocism is about.  Easy to read and broken very nicely into &quot;digestable&quot; sections.  I will keep this book for my daughter and give it to her to read when she becomes old enough to learn about her faith.  It is a great starter.	2002-08-12

I am third generation Lebanese-American and love Lebanese food, so people are always sending me cookbooks, and this book was just such a gift.  This book has some very good recipies, however, I found some of them incomplete or difficult to follow.  Having cooked Lebanese food myself now for a few years, I have been able overcome these difficulties.  I highly recommend this books version of Fattoush and it's two Lentil Soup recipies.  Those three recipies stand out the most.  The food in this cookbook is healthy and very tasty.  If you live in an are where fresh produce is readily available here is a book that can help you use it all.	2002-08-07

I have prepared many of the dishes in this book with great success.  I enjoy cooking Lebanese food regularly (now if I could just get some help with the language).  The recipes are easy to follow and yield marvelous results.  I highly recommend the Lentil Soup (Shourbat Addis)and the Lebanese Squash stuffed with lamb and rice (Kousa Mihshi). Reading Ms. Sawaya's introduction and tips greatly enhanced my enjoyment of using this cookbook.  If you are interested in preparing Lebanese foods, or like me, remembering food from you childhood, this book is an excellent place to start. Simple recipies that produce tasty results.	2002-08-07

Gary Paulsen writes in a style that is both simple to read and amusing.  I don't normally read this type of book, but it was given to me by a friend who said it would make me laugh. It really did make me laugh.  His descriptions of his wrecks and mistakes is both sad and amusing.  At times reading this book I find myself asking &quot;what's this fool doing? He is certainly not thinking!&quot;  Just after I ask that question I would laugh out loud at some fantastic wreck he has.  His relationship with the dogs is a bit out there.  I am not sure he can learn as much from a dog as he seems to say, however, maybe the cold, hunger and sheer exhaustion distorted his view of the lessons he was learning.  It is a great adventure book and one that I would recommend to young readers (Paulsens normal target audience will LOVE this book)interested in adventure.  It was different genre for myself, yet I enjoyed it all the same.	2002-06-29

He brings back old ideas that people did naturally before the \\"new science of parenting.\\"  It seems like the more parents I listen too, I hear extremes on raising children.  Mr. Rosemond reminds us that there is a middle ground.  My daughter is only 2 and we have used this middle ground full of common sense and have had fantastic results with our little girl.  If your a parent and feel overwhelmed by all the advice floating around out there about parenting, I would highly suggest you read this book.  It will bring you back down to earth and give you some middle ground.  He takes logical and intelligent approaches to self-esteem, spanking, television, chores and allowance to name a few.  It's quick read, like hearing old wisdom from a generation before us.  Highly recommended!	2002-06-29

Yogi is still a lovable character to read. His words aren't just silly misquotes he's said throughout the years. When you read what Yogi meant by his short \\"yogi-isms\\", there is logical and heartfelt meaning behind the saying and the man. This book is an extremely quick read. Very humorous and easy to understand. Yogi is down to earth with common sense advice, (nothing you haven't heard before) and funny stories behind the sayings that have made him so loved throughout the years. A great addition to any fans library and a fantastic rainy day book.	2002-06-18

Well at least I heard the popular version. While reading this book I was amazed out how the press idolized and covered up for this man. While he was a great athlete, the look at the man was scary. So many people idolized him, worshipped him, wanted to be him. Now looking behind the dapper suits and elegant smile we see a man that no one wants to be. If he were alive today, I think the press would tear him apart. Mr. Cramer gives a critical look at what motivated Joe DiMaggio. While a lot of readers that I have spoken to feel the book is overly critical, I disagree. I think it is an honest look. We learn what Joe DiMaggio loved and what he did to get what he loved. I recommend this book to anyone who loves the history of baseball. It doesn't diminish my love for the lore of the game at all, it just adds more depth to it. As a father, I watch even more closely who my kids will come to call their heros, and it will remind me to teach them that even heros are human, and make mistakes. This book is a fantastic look at how America's need for a hero allowed a nation to look the other way from the real man. My only negative comment is that the book skipped the entire 1970's. It jumps from the death or Marilyn Monroe to the 1989 earthquakes in California's Bay Area. Great Read.	2002-06-16

I found Jordan's second adventure in the Wheel of Time even better than the first.  I didn't think it possible, however, Mr. Jordan pulled it off. I was amazed at the world that the author created around his characters.  I really enjoyed the fortress of Fal Dara.  Jordan stays with his initial characters, not really introducing any new ones.  He gives you a large taste of the Dark One and a glimpse at the forsaken.  The characters are so well developed that you can really relate to them.  I think Rand is my favorite character with Matrim running a close second.  As each character struggles to learn their place in the story, you can feel there emotions and almost understand their thoughts.  Jordan has done a fantastic job at brining a world alive as vividly as any author I can think of.  The only draw back to this series is as I look ahead, I am not sure how long he can keep it going.  I was sceptical that the second book would leave a lot to be desired, however, I think it is better than the first. I urge anyone who enjoys fantasy writing to read the Wheel of Time Series.  Off to book 3!	2001-08-13

I think that maybe it was because I had already had some expirience with investing prior to reading this book.  There are other books out there that gave me more information.  This book is also very limited in the places it gives you to start investing your $10 a week.  I also found that most of those places want much more than $10 to start a drip account.  Not bad for a first time investor though.	2001-08-13

While it was very good in some cases of my daughters inability to sleep, it recommends that you must keep your child on the same schedule EVERY NIGHT! I don't know any family in todays world that can do this.  It simply isn't practicle.  It sets up a very rigid sleep schedule that was impossible for my wife and I to keep.  I did find it useful for specific problems like how to get my daughter back to sleep when she wakes up in the middle of the evening.  Anyway, it wasn't as good as Mom's and Mother-in-Laws good old fashioned advice!	2001-08-13

Other than reading the HOBIT in high school I have read mostly history.  I found this novel to hold explicit details.  The characters come alive as you read.  Jordan brings characters in and out of his story so that you don't get bored following one character around.  He uses young farmers/shepherds as his heroes. Jordan creates their villiage so you can see it and feel it as if you were there. Once the characters leave their home in a quaint villiage in the Two Rivers you learn of the greater world somewhere out there.  I found this book to be an incredible read and can not wait to read following books.  I am not an experienced fantasy reader so I don't have much to compare Mr. Jordan's work with, but I know I loved this book and am looking forward to round two.  If anyone has suggestions of similar works, I would love to hear about it.	2001-08-12

This books is a wonderful intorduction to get you started while onboard this beautiful Square-Rigger. It takes you through the lines and pinrail, that you need to know to work the sails. It doesn't give you sufficient navigation information, so you'd learn that as you go. After reading the book and putting what I learned into action, I am forever hooked on sailing ships and the sea! If your interested in sailing ships or one of America's naval treasures, I encourage you to read this book.	2000-06-11
