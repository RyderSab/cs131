He is really talented at weaving complicated suspense with interesting characters, and in this book he returns to the Mississippi setting he knows so well.  There are even appearances from characters and a storyline from two of his previous books, so that's a little extra fun for readers familiar with his work.  What makes Iles' books even more appealing is the range of topics that he explores.  Each book is a well-written suspense tale, and Blood Memory is no exception.  I think it's his best book by far since The Quiet Game.  The topical subject matter of Blood Memory is a troubling reality.  While the basic plot idea of vengeance in this arena has been tried by other authors, Iles tells a more powerful story across the spectrum of predator and prey.  This book really has a lot going for it:  classic Iles suspense, detailed forensics, strong female characters, and vivid storytelling.  Not only is it a hard book to put down, it's also one that will be hard to forget.	2005-02-21

His approach begins with how he was first exposed to Texas history and all its myth and legend as a schoolboy in Texas.  His personal experiences with race and segregation then began to mold his worldview and contributed to his academic study of history.  Race and Texas continued to be important themes in his professional pursuits, as one chapter shows how Crisp uncovered the real Sam Houston speech to volunteers at Refugio, a speech much different from the one alleged to have been a racist attack against the Mexican opposition.  This episode in Sleuthing the Alamo illustrates how history is often more complex than it appears at first glance (even with hindsight) as a document purported to be a genuine record of Houston's speech and relied on by academics was the product of censorship, mistranslation, and embellishment - by four different parties influencing the document itself for over a century.  Uncovering the stories behind the allegedly racist Houston speech solidified Crisp's thesis that race was more a consequence than a cause of the Texas Revolution. The Houston speech \\"detective story\\" is just the beginning.  No doubt the most controversial part of this book will be what Crisp has to say about the de la Pena diary and the fate of Davy Crockett at the Alamo, a subject to which Crisp is no stranger to controversy.  He provides a similar rundown of the Yellow Rose of Texas legend in the afterword, but the final verdict on that legend seems less well settled by comparison, and it appears to in fact remain under investigation.  Overall, an extremely readable book that will capture anyone interested in Texas history, the Alamo, the role of legend in culture, and the process of historical documentary research.	2004-12-11
US	49816384	R26JPPHIG1O72I	055309128X	120642208	Icon	Books	4	12	12	N	N	book is much better than the May 2005 TV movie version	Forsyth actually wrote Icon in 1996 and set it in the Russia of 1999, a country he projected would be plagued by a vast criminal underworld, increasingly disillusioned with the new democracy and capitalist systems, and subject to a return to Communist and other totalitarian rule.  That makes Forsyth's work even more impressive with hindsight, in a similar way as for The Devil's Alternative and The Fist of God - describing specific elements or trends that in fact appear quite familiar later on.  The Jason Monk character is one of Forsyth's more memorable ones, and he is developed a little differently than the norm with the way the book is written in two parts.  There is also a reappearance of some characters in previous Forsyth books, something which works well in Icon but is not something which Forsyth often does.  Icon isn't quite at the level of Forsyth's best work, but it is certainly good enough to demonstrate his ability to tell a good story and spin an entertaining yarn involving international intrigue.	2004-06-05

Based on the first Gulf War, it is an intriguing blend of actual events and personalities with great storytelling.  The military detail rivals that of Tom Clancy's better technothrillers, and the political and espionage coverage is vintage Forsyth.  In Fist of God, he weaves agents from the SAS, SIS, CIA, Mossad, and several Iraqi branches in the runup to the Coalition invasion and its short duration.  Nice blend of plot, detail, suspense, and character development across the board.  Also includes prescient remarks about human intelligence in what Forsyth calls &quot;A Final Note.&quot;  Written in 1994, it was ahead of its time regarding WMD, etc.	2004-06-03

While Quinn, &quot;the negotiator,&quot; is an interesting and entertaining character to follow, I don't think he lives up to the claim of &quot;Forsyth's best yet.&quot;  The plots and subplots here are really nothing very unique, but the book is good because of the way Forsyth tells it and puts it together.  There are some nice surprises, especially in the last third of the book, and the conclusion, while perhaps quick, is quite satisfactory.  The inclusion of Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev in their respective real-life political roles is handled well but is by no means a primary focus of the book.  The Negotiator is good, but if you're pressed for time and can only choose one Forsyth novel, you'd be better served to choose one of the others.	2004-05-19

The plot and the multiple threads being woven together in The Devil's Alternative have been taken up a notch by comparison; a bit slow at first perhaps but well worth the wait by the end.  It was fun to read this considering that it was written in 1979-1980.  The American President in the book, William Matthews, was clearly modeled after Jimmy Carter; likewise, his hawkish National Security Adviser, Stanislaw Poklewski, reflects Zbigniew Brzezinski (Carter's NSC man) while the more dovish Secretary of State David Lawrence reflects Cyrus Vance (Carter's main Sec/State).  And there's a Margaret Thatcher-esque Prime Minister in Britain as well.  Forsyth was prescient with the issues in the book too - there's arms reductions talks and grain and technology transfers going on between the superpowers - plus the idea of nationalism behind the Iron Curtain being a force in the decline of the Soviet Union.  But that's only part of what's going on in this book; add a power play within the Politburo, classic Moscow espionage, a sophisticated amateur operation against the Soviet Union, and the largest oil tanker known to man, and Forsyth spins a great tale in The Devil's Alternative.	2004-04-08

It has the fast pace and pretty far-fetched plot of several of his NFL-based thrillers (such as Outlaws), but it also has some of the originality and hook of his more recent legal thrillers (such as The Letter of the Law and The Fifth Angel).  The First 48 is not as good as his legal thrillers; it really signals more of a return to the action/suspense stories Green spun in some of his later NFL novels.  The style in this book is very short chapters that are episodic, though Green ties them together nicely, that don't really give you much character development.  Green starts off strong, as he usually does, but then gets a little carried away with the plot.  A couple parts had me saying with a laugh &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;  But it's entertaining, and the conclusion is fitting though short.  The First 48 is not Green's best effort, but it's still fun.	2004-02-08

Morison started out trying to disprove the Easter story as a rational journalist and ended up doing a 180.  He still relies on reason and balancing the written source material for his analysis of the aftermath of the crucifixion.  He relies on the Gospel accounts enough that believers will likely be strengthened in their faith while those who are skeptical might remain skeptical.  He also seems too ready to find the Gospel accounts non-reconcilable in certain details when they can be reconciled (such as whether the figure who confronted Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb was an angel or not, if there were more than one, etc.).  Does a nice job of looking at these events from a variety of perspectives.  Morison seems to have left no stone unturned in his examination of the resurrection in Who Moved the Stone.	2004-01-05

In Avenger, he revisits a familiar theme of revenge, one he handles well in many of his novels and short stories.  But Avenger is unique from many revenge novels because it is not merely revenge that \\"the avenger\\" is seeking; instead, it is justice.  Forsyth provides a great character with the man who is \\"the avenger\\" - a character reminiscent of the Clark/Kelly figure in Tom Clancy's novels (featured in Without Remorse).  This book weaves several threads into a larger story; this is well-done, and the individual episodes are good enough to stand alone.  While there are several elements that you see in other novels and in the thriller genre in general, Forsyth shows his talent with his precision of words and quality of narrative.  His writing flows in giving depth to his characters and action to his plot.  Nothing that is necessary is left out, but neither is anything extraneous left in.  Simply a pleasure to read besides being another remarkable Forsyth tale of action/suspense.	2003-10-21

If you're already familiar with Forsyth, this is a collection of short stories similar to The Veteran.  The stories in No Comebacks are shorter, usually about 20-30 pages each, ten in all.  They are a little more lighthearted than the tone of Forsyth's novels, which are predominantly serious, and most involve an unexpected twist or turn along the way (sometimes saved for the very end).  There's a story in here for everyone:  a playboy in pursuit of a married woman, a victim of prejudice out for revenge, an answer to a mid-life crisis, a way to handle extortion, a response to a soiled reputation, and a unique way to settle an estate, to name a few.  Timeless little episodes that are well-written and delightful to read.	2003-10-13
US	49816384	R3UE0EN942KE9H	0743234693	844233229	The Footprints of God	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Iles gets metaphysical - interesting for science folks	I have enjoyed all of Greg Iles' novels, including Footprints of God, though it does not meet the quality of suspense in his previous books.  It addresses questions about mankind, mind, consciousness, religion, etc. in a metaphysical way.  The dream sequences of medical ethicist Dr. David Tennant that lead him to an increasing relationship with psychiatrist Dr. Rachel Weiss are a central element.  Tennant is overseeing the progress of a top-secret information project codenamed Trinity, and he becomes suspicious of the project's future and his colleagues' motives when a leading Trinity scientist dies suddenly.  How the plot is resolved regarding Trinity and national security comes across as secondary to the ideas mentioned above that Iles is playing with.  The author has tackled something very different in most of his books, including classic World War II-based historical thrillers, serial killer and legal dramas, and even spirit possession.  For me the suspense did not quite measure up to what he's achieved before.  I wanted to finish the book more because the ideas were interesting rather than wanting to find out if Tennant and Weiss would escape their pursuers.  So I enjoyed the first half of the book better and thought the conclusion was mediocre.  Tennant and the dead scientist are the most interesting characters, so it's up to Tennant to keep the reader interested.  Usually Iles uses several primary characters to tell the story, but this is pretty much a one-man show.  Iles indicates in the acknowledgments that he had a hard time striking a balance between complex ideas and mass market fiction; I think he did fine on this point.  Though Iles resolves these ideas differently than I might, I still enjoyed reading the book overall.  For pure suspense, I would recommend Spandau Phoenix, Mortal Fear, or The Quiet Game.	2003-08-15

Unlike The Deceiver, they are not unified by a single character or overall scheme.  What they are unified by is Forsyth's ability to tell a good story, and he tells each in a unique setting of place and time including modern-day Britain, World War II Italy, an international airliner, and the American West.  &quot;Whispering Wind&quot; is the real gem in this book.  It's a simple but delightful tale about a lone survivor from Custer's Last Stand.  Each of the stories in The Veteran has a twist somewhere along the way - sometimes more obvious than others and sometimes revealed closer to the end too.  Each also has a significant amount of detail for its setting, showing Forsyth's ability to pay attention to the little things in his writing.  Mainly these stories are a pleasure to read and that's what makes The Veteran worth a look.	2003-07-17

This only covers through The Sum of All Fears (his sixth novel), so it's a little dated.  But it's still worth taking a look at since this first group of books is certainly Clancy's best.  It begins with an analysis of each of those first six novels.  Next comes a big section of Q&amp;A with Clancy where he gives his views on foreign policy, gun control, and all sorts of issues.  Then there's a glossary/reference section which defines important characters, military equipment, technology, etc. in his books.

This book will probably come as a shock to a lot of women, so beware.  This one is written for married men, but what it says applies to all guys.

The Soviets have a plot that will lead England to be a socialist ally, and it is up to a fairly minor British civil servant to thwart it.  The plot versus the detective work is told simultaneously like in the Jackal.  There's a nice section about uncovering a false-flag spy operation in London, and it's a jewel theft of all things that gets the ball rolling.  An interesting disparity is set up between the Brit detective and his spy chief; one thinks the USSR can be beaten outright while the other feels he must acknowledge the USSR as an enemy that's here to stay.	2003-07-13

Keegan achieves this remarkably. There is so much that can be said about Churchill, but this book boils down the bottom line essentials - the essentials of what Churchill did, where he failed, how he triumphed, what made him tick, and what makes him endure so many years later as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, political leaders of the twentieth century.	2003-07-09

Winik reflects on history overall, not just American, and in civil wars in particular to argue that what happened in April 1865 made the United States unique; this month was pivotal in reuniting a single nation devoid of the lingering strifes that plague most countries stricken with civil war. Of course, Winik is looking back on this with about 140 years of hindsight. That's not to say that there wasn't discord after the Civil War - certainly there was much of it, and Reconstruction was an extremely difficult period for the nation as a whole and for the South especially; the civil rights ramifications took a long time to work out, and our nation still faces questions about race and equality even today. What Winik is saying is that April 1865 could have gone a lot differently: rather than surrender, a decision by the Confederate armies led by Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, and others to melt into the countryside and continue fighting as guerrilla bands would not have promoted national reconciliation by any means. Likewise, the tragic drama of the Lincoln assassination plot could have had very different outcomes too. Yet there was resolution to the military side of the Civil War in this crucial month, and it is the nature of that resolution that Winik finds so compelling in making a well-reasoned and thought-provoking argument.	2003-07-09

Each starts off well enough, with a sort of unique or at least interesting premise, but then either meanders along or steadily declines through the end.  In The Fifth Angel, Jack Ruskin is a down-and-out guy who manages to balance a successful career by day and a dangerous hobby by night - that hobby is selecting random child sex offenders and eliminating them.  The novel loses its steam as it brings Ruskin and a female FBI agent/profiler to a predictable rendezvous in a rather disappointing conclusion.	2003-07-09

The book is a collection of novellas that revolve around the career of one of British intelligence's most effective operatives. Unfortunately for that operative, he is being sent by the new administration into quiet retirement on the eve of the end of the Cold War.

When he begins to discover that the truth of that murder has major ramifications for the present state of affairs in his hometown as well as his personal past and his psyche, the plot of The Quiet Game reaches the high level of Iles' best books.

Set in the modern day, the book centers around a programmer for a computer service who suspects that random murder victims are being selected through his service. In the course of investigating his hunch, he gets on the trail of a highly elusive and frightening serial killer whose motivations will bring the two characters ever closer together. The suspense of who the perpetrator is, how the murders are being committed, and how law enforcement's chase is resolved is outstanding; that suspense and Iles' ability to write so effectively on so many different levels demonstrates his considerable talent.	2003-07-09

The plot, a modified kindnapping/ransom scheme on the children of selected wealthy parents, is interesting but is far less complex than the rest of Iles' books. There is not much character development, and there is not much to be done with the plot given its limited scope. It is just a matter of whether the victims in this particular episode will escape with their lives or not. There are no historical backdrops, no subplots, and no weaving of multiple threads in which Iles really struts his stuff. You could boil this book down and have a lot less leftover than in most of Iles' books.  It is not a bad read, but it just does not fulfill what Iles normally achieves.	2003-07-09

Sleep No More starts on that path but cannot sustain it. The pieces are there with the Southern setting, the complex characters (including a supporting return by Penn Cage from The Quiet Game), and the suspense; however, this one goes a bit too far with the eroticism and a bit off the deep end with the believability. The basis is spirit possession, and it does not make for Iles' best work. It is similar to 24 Hours in that way - it just does not deliver what Iles is capable of providing his reader.  Most of his books are good enough I would consider rereading - not so with Sleep No More.	2003-07-09

Odessa is a secret organization dedicated to furthering the interests of the Nazi regime in the post-World War II era, and the book is about one German's encounters with that group.

The initial investigator is a photojournalist who gets wrapped up in the chase.  Much of the book is set in New Orleans.

This time the story is completely within the wartime context, except for the frame of a doctor discovering the unknown but heroic exploits of his grandfather. That grandfather begins World War II as a pacifist researcher in Oxford, England, looking for counters to poison gas, but he comes out of the war something entirely different. A plan by British intelligence to end the threat of Hitler's poison gas program, the same Israeli operative from Spandau Phoenix, and the characters of a unique Nazi concentration camp join in changing that grandfather forever. With fewer characters than Spandau Phoenix, Iles develops these a bit more but does less with the overall plot.  I thought this one moved considerably slower for no good reason.  Black Cross is not as good as Spandau Phoenix, but it is still a solid read.	2003-07-09

Using the fascinating true story of the Hess mission to England during World War II, the book begins with the death of a prisoner (who was supposed to have been Hess) in Berlin's Spandau Prison. The question of that prisoner's true identity sets the superpowers on edge, culminating in an extravagant neo-Nazi plot engineered by a mega-rich eccentric.  There's plenty of equally interesting characters, including a German policeman and an Israeli secret agent.  The conclusion could have been better, but getting there is well worth the trip.
