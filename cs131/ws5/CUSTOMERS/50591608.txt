And that is exactly what Wert promises in the preface...a military history.  There were parts of the book I didn't like however, and they ocurred before Wert got underway with his Civil War explainations.  My complaint concerns Wert's unbalanced exposition on the causal relations to conflicts he describes.  We learn that Longstreet's Confederate sympathies were fostered when he was young, growing up on his uncle's cotton plantation.  Wert asserts that talks on the \\"tariff of abominations\\" and other Southern grievances got plenty of play in this setting, which instilled in the future Confederate General feelings pro-South.  Wert's background here is very important to understanding the world-view of the later Longstreet.<br />However, Wert then fails to fairly represent both the Mexican War in regard to Mexico, and Native American/White settler conflicts in Texas in regard to Native Americans.  Wert blames the U.S.-Mexican War on the gross supposition that \\"Mexico sundered diplomatic relations with the United States.\\"  He blames U.S. General Taylor's 1846 march toward the Rio Grande on a Mexico that \\"rejected President Polk's offer to buy California.\\"  \\"If the Mexicans wanted war, Polk would oblige them,\\" Wert continues.  Concerning the Native American/settler tensions in Texas in the 1850's, Wert blames those \\"marauding Indians.\\"<br />I'm not sure whether Mr. Wert learned about the Mexican War and early Native American/Texan relations from outdated history books, or if he's just a proponent of an ignorant and simplistic misrepresentation of facts.  Perhaps an analogy is begging.  Mr. Wert, if I moved onto your property, secured it, told you to find another place to live, and offered to reimburse you at a sum I felt equal to your troubles or I'd declare war on you and your family, what would be your reaction?<br />I give the Civil War-era information on General Longstreet five stars!

I found it very informative regarding Grant's and Lee's personal and professional lives, but I also learned a lot about 1800's American culture as well...and I'm hardly a novice when it comes to the Civil War-era.  Seeing as one Anderson is a college professor and the other is a journalist, \\"The Generals\\" is immaculately written, an all-too-often rarity concerning history books nowadays.  The fact that the book is such a smooth read puts it ahead of the other Grant/Lee bios out.  The Andersons' are economical writers, communicating in a few hundred pages what other long-winded folks take volumes to say.  As far as the mildly negative Library Journal review goes, I wonder if that has anything to do with the Andersons' refusal to pull punches when speaking of the frailties of both Grant and Lee.  These long since dead men are idealized to such an extent today that it's hard to get a feel for the people they really were.  After reading \\"The Generals,\\" I feel that I know both Ulysses Grant and Robert Lee, triumphs failures and draws, as well as I'm ever going to.  If you're tired of reading the same old stories about Honorable Lee or Stubborn Grant, and want to get a deeper understanding of two of the most important men in American Civil War, give \\"The Generals\\" a shot.  Happy reading!	2003-04-24
