What's different about the Workbook is Silman's total emphasis on asking and answering lots of questions in detail that force the reader to actively participate. Silman presents a position and wants you to evaluate it, interrogate it, throw it against a wall and find out what's in its pockets before giving your plan and move.  <br />You will learn to create and use imbalances to devise plans and find moves in every stage of the game because the entire Workbook asks you to do nothing else. This isn't passive learning. It's more like, \\"Pop quiz, hot shot! Black has just played ...Nh5 and is going to win the two bishops. What do you do? What do you do?\\" <br />You don't need to have read the earlier books since Silman gives a crash course on imbalances. If you've read them and felt you'd understood them (and yet didn't see any improvement as I had), this is another opportunity to get it right.  Everyone has their own level of chess incompetence beyond which they will be unlikely to improve, and I may have already reached mine and you yours. But how can you be sure? \\"We can not know what is inevitable until we try good and hard to stop it.\\"<br />It's a fun read, too. (By the way, I actually worked through the entire book before I decided to &quot;review&quot; it. Maybe some of the other reviewers should've tried doing that.)	2001-10-29

You play Black and I'll play White.\\"<br />Weeramantry is a great coach and it shows: he questions the ambitious player about individual moves (\\"Why is 8. fxe5 bad here?\\") and long-term positional considerations (\\"On which side of the board is White strongest? How should he proceed?\\")<br />The ten lessons in the book are based on ten games - mostly played by Weeramantry, a FIDE Master - that exemplify attacking principles using weak squares, weak color complexes, piece coordination, and initiative. <br />He assumes an advanced beginner and intermediate player level of knowledge. Openings are discussed mostly in terms of general principles and their effects on planning. He shows how plans evolve out of pawn structures, piece placement and enemy counter play. Weeramantry does not forget to explain how weak pawns, decentralized forces, pawn majorities, all affect a player's decision to seek or avoid the endgame.<br />Weeramantry summarizes each lesson with guidelines, advice, and supplementary games (about 30-50 extra games in all). There is a lot of practical advice, encouragement, words of warning, and general consideration for readers of all strengths.<br /> \\"With that in mind, what next? How do we keep the attack going?\\"	2001-09-20

It is learning that involves \\"openness to novelty; alertness to distinction; sensitivity to different contexts; implicit, if not explicit, awareness of multiple perspectives; and orientation in the present.\\" What might this all mean for us? Perhaps our educational curriculums need to be taught differently, maybe our jobs could be more enjoyable, and self-improvement less onerous.<br />She states the myths of conventional learning:<BR>1.The basics must be learned so well that they become second nature.<BR>2.Paying attention means being focused on one thing at a time.<BR>3.Delaying gratification is important.<BR>4.Rote memorization is necessary.<BR>5.Forgetting is a problem.<BR>6.Intelligence is knowing \\"what's out there.\\"<BR>7.There are right and wrong answers.<BR>Each chapter discusses, in a nondogmatic manner, theory and possible reasons why these myths are not always helpful.<br />This is not, as Professor Langer states, a \\"how-to\\" book with prescriptions and study programs for the self-help \\"professional learner\\" (as one reviewer phrased it.) It doesn't have cute little &quot;mind-maps,&quot; and it isn't a De Bono's \\"Thinking Course\\"-type book. The reviewer (Adamson, January 22, 1999) might have learned something if he'd been less smug about his naive faith in those &quot;accelerated&quot; learning books which don't deliver half of what they claim.<br />Personally, I found this book extremely helpful in my own personal studies - from learning to play tennis and golf better, becoming more fluent in Spanish, improving my chess - since I try to find alternative methods, perspectives, and just plain fun in learning. I don't try to be perfect. I don't think there's only one way to do something. Try it.	2001-09-13

(Cadogan Chess Books)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Learn Through Enjoyment	This book contains twenty games played in the 1990s by world-class players (like Shirov, Anand and Kramnik) with questions and points awarded at critical move decisions. GM Daniel King's commentary is entertaining and insightful. In Christiansen-Browne 1990, game 4 entitled \\"Roll of the Dice,\\" for example, he notes after move 17 \\"if by some brainstorm you came up with this move, take two points, a couple of tranquilizers, and rest of the week off work\\" before pointing out the positional considerations involved \\"the bishop on f4 is the one worth preserving as it is settled on such a good square.\\" I am not claiming, however, this is a comprehensive chess self-improvement course. There is a didactic quality throughout the book but it is not in the style of Nunn's Understanding Chess or Chernev's Logical Chess. Just enjoy the games, watch how the pros do it, and take the rest of the week off work.	2001-09-07

Heisman teaches practical skills youll need to progress beyond a novice level: instant pattern recognition; making a material advantage count, and other stuff more advanced books take for granted and therefore never explain. <br />One of the most practical (and immediately effective) skills the author teaches is developing board vision - the ability to see tactical opportunities quickly. If youre having trouble, for example, instantly seeing squares a knight can reach, youre going to wander into knight forks and lose games. Practice with a lone knight and empty board, visualize moves, add some pieces and then practice knight forks, the same way a basketball player practices freethrows. Ive done it with every piece: drilling myself on pins, skewers, and double attacks.  It really works, and its not just for beginners either!  <br />Another skill the author teaches is the art of making material superiority payoff. Since most beginners frequently lose pieces without compensation and yet dont resign as they know their opponent will probably return the favor, youll need to know how to finish that SOB off once youre a bishop ahead!<br />Youll enjoy chess more fully (and win more games) once youve studied these basic fundamentals. Youll also be able to benefit from the really hard stuff in more advanced books because youre proficient in the easy stuff.	2001-08-07

I've studied The Inner Game from cover to cover three times in the last 2 years, always profitably. My ability to successfully calculate attacking or defending variations has greatly increased because of practicing what Soltis preaches. I strongly agree with his statement \\"...calculation can be invaluable. It can be a substitute for \\"book knowledge\\" you never learned\\" since few nonprofessionals can know every opening or endgame position. <br />I am surprised at some of the few negative comments in the reviews of the book. I suspect that those reviewers have not read The Inner Game to the end - at least they give no evidence of having done so. One reviewer wrote that \\"the familiar theme of attacking a castled king\\" was monotonously used in many examples but really there are few problems that have that as their main theme. Another reviewer said, \\"There are not enough practical examples. Therefore, I doubt the reader will be able to apply the tips ...in a real game.\\"  Actually, there are over 200 examples; most labeled \\"White to play\\" or  \\"Black to play\\" presenting positions from Grandmaster games to analyze before reading the accompanying text. <br />This same reviewer stated The Inner Game has the \\"right appealing chapter names. But the content ... is not well developed\\" although he doesn't clarify what he means by that. Yet in every chapter Soltis clearly states his theme and then provides a great deal of examples. For instance, look at chapter 2 (\\"Ideas\\"), where Soltis discusses how calculation is inspired by ideas and ideas come from recognizing patterns and weaknesses. Examine chapter 3 (\\"Trees and How To Build Them\\"), in which Soltis shows you in a very detailed fashion a possible way of mentally organizing all those ideas. Disagree with the chapter contents but don't say they're not well developed. <br />In that reviewer's opinion the Dvoretsky series of books, Jonathan Tisdall's \\"Improve Your Chess Now\\" and Buckley's \\"Practical Chess Analysis\\" are all \\"certainly better than Soltis\\" - but he doesn't bother to say in what way.  My impression is Dvoretsky's books are written for very experienced players, Tisdall is not focused on calculation and while Buckley's book is all about calculation it is far shorter, with much fewer examples and less text.<br />One reviewer said the book was \\"not coherently organized.\\" Huh? Soltis begins logically enough by defining his terms: what calculation is and isn't. He follows with a second chapter on how ideas inspire calculation. The third chapter presents a method of organizing those ideas. Having set up the basic groundwork, Soltis expands on the methods: finding forcing sequences that make calculation easier, evaluating resulting positions,  \\"monkey wrenches\\" that upset the calculations, practical considerations. Where's the \\"lack of organization\\"?   <br />The reviewer claims the book has so many analytical mistakes (he has 2 examples) their \\"sheer number\\" proves \\"Soltis hadn't done his spadework.\\" He cites Piket-Sosonko, 1993 and says 3...Bf5 \\"holds the game for Black.\\" Well, I'm no GM like Soltis but I do have Fritz 6 and a 950 MHz computer and it begs to differ with that assessment (in one variation winning Black's queen). Similarly, the reviewer says in Ljubojevic-Stein, 1973 the move 11 Qf4 works fine for White but Fritz's deep position analysis finds that 11...f5 12 Nd4 g5 13 Qg3 f4 leads to an uncomfortable White position where his queen is in the path of both Black pieces and pawns.  He announces \\"The examples that are correct are frequently so because they've been pulled, with analysis, from other sources\\" but doesn't name those sources! He adds \\"many of the examples are hackneyed\\" without saying in what way (Perhaps he skimmed the first chapter; saw a diagram from Nimzovich-Marshall, 1927 and another from Reshevsky-Botvinnik, 1955, and didn't realize most of the book's examples are from GM games played circa 1970-1993.)  <br />I strongly agree with A.J. Goldsby's review: thisisn't a book for novices, a couple of primers on tactics and elementary books like Chernev's Logical Chess should be studied first. I strongly agree with the reviewer who said to benefit from this book you'd really need to study and practice although he is wrong when he says \\"Soltis emphasizes visualization\\" since Soltis only has one visualization exercise in the first chapter and rarely mentions it thereafter. Again, read the entire book before you make the claim!	2001-07-15

Koontz takes well over one-fourth of the book's 600 plus pages just to set the opening scene (dozens of pages alone for the car crash, Barty's birth and hospital stay) which led me to wonder how he was ever going to get to the end of the week, let alone Barty's thirteenth birthday. Despite being a long-time Koontz reader, I felt a lot of the suspense and disbelief I experienced was more about Koontz's glacial pacing than about the story. Koontz seemed to realize how long the project was getting and sped things up about 300 pages into the book but not for the better since the climactic encounter with the villain and our saintly heroes occurs 600 pages in and lasts for only a couple of paragraphs. That's it! The whole point of the book - the encounter between good and evil - and its over in a blink and a push! I feel Koontz just started typing without a real goal in mind until he neared his 600 page contract requirement and decided to wrap things up.	2001-07-05

John Nunn's Puzzle Book is different from most puzzle books. Nunn's problems are generally much harder and less predictable; they all have lengthy solutions in which non-forced quiet moves and non-captures are frequently embedded. This isn't a collection of brilliant sacrifices where the player makes the most spectacular capture with check leading to a forced move variation; tactical drills are best sought elsewhere.<br />I admit the publisher's advertising blurb could have been more clear (&quot;Most chess puzzle books put you in an artificial situation: you are told a combination exists, what the theme is, and what you are required to achieve. This one is different&quot;) because, as the previous reviewer notes, &quot;all puzzles books put you in artificial positions!&quot; However, presumably the reader of a puzzle book - unless he's been dropped on his head as a child -knows there are combinations in the book.<br />Nunn clearly writes &quot;one cannot disguise the fact that there is &quot;something&quot; in the position, but I do not see why the challenge should be made even more artificial by giving away further information.&quot; The previous reviewer seems to think that Nunn contradicts this statement, breaking &quot;the book's promises,&quot; by providing background comments (as well as specific hints in a separate section for the baffled) for the puzzles.  However, if you can solve a problem from comments as cryptic as &quot;White has a number of promising attacking continuations, but how can he force immediate resignation?&quot; or &quot;It takes some time to grasp what might be going on in this totally weird position. What should Black play, and what should the result be?&quot; then you should be writing puzzle books, not buying them. Simply ignore the comments and look only at the diagrams if you want no &quot;help.&quot;<br />The previous reviewer writes &quot;Nunn gathered the material for this book from old Informator issues and some of his own games... Do we really need a puzzle book then?&quot; implying that the puzzles were already published and Nunn is simply repackaging them as new and his own. In fact, Nunn writes the puzzles were based on his own unpublished analysis of Informator annotations, along with personal game notes and an analysis of two tournaments (Karlsbad 1911 and 1993 Biel). The previous reviewer basically concludes that finding and solving on one's own the puzzle in any game is best and that &quot;Puzzle books, even good ones like Nunn's, rob the reader of this discovery.&quot; Nonsense! Nothing prevents one from analyzing games on one's own - if one so chooses - in the meantime, there are a number of interesting puzzles in John Nunn's Puzzle book.r this book from old Informator issues and some of his own games...

You might want to read this book if you were in a coma during the election and missed the TV news or newspaper reports. Its written from a very conservative point-of-view in which everything the Democrats do is evil and anything the Republicans do is good - even if they're the same thing! Crocodile tears are shed for a couple of hundred late arriving military votes while the disqualification of thousands of potentially Democratic votes are blithely dismissed with a shrug that \\"life's not fair.\\"  The author's obviously preaching to the choir here and in no way tries to be objective but that's no surprise given his background and the title of his book. I found this book in the bargain bin where it had been discounted twice before having a 50% off sticker so I only paid [price] so I'm not out much. This book is mainly for non-readers or die-hard Republicans since it is poorly written, scantily researched, and slants so far to the right it makes Jesse Helms look like a bleeding heart liberal.	2001-06-28

Nunn's 30 game selections are impressive. Among others, there's an exciting 1996 Khalifman-Shveshnikov game in which White catches the Black king in the center and never gives him time to castle.  Nunn recounts his 1999 Nunn-Nataf battle in which our author is on the wrong end of a sacrificial onslaught that breaks White's kingside position.  We witness an amazing 1999 Bu Xiangzhi - Ye Jiangchuan clash where attack and counter-attack are vividly displayed as both players attack on opposites sides of the board their respective rooks both holding the enemy at bay and simultaneously threatening to mate the enemy king. Nunn entertains and enlightens with both prose descriptions and heavy-duty calculations. <br />The reviewer who was irritated with Nunn's introduction should reread it more carefully. Nunn is not ridiculing general principles when he argues, \\"much greater emphasis is placed on the concrete requirements of a given position rather than obeying abstract principles.\\" Comparing modern dynamic play (like game 20, Kasparov-Shirov, 1994) to a driver desperately avoiding a collision misses Nunn's point: \\"if a leading grandmaster thinks a position requires a particular plan he will embark on it.\\" Kasparov was clearly in control during the opening when he moved his knight seven times in thirteen moves and developed his rook via a4 and b4 only to immediately sacrifice it for a bishop. <br />The reviewer fails to understand what Nunn means by \\"half-truths.\\" I think Nunn is clear when he writes, \\"If the evaluation of a position depends on a tactical finesse eight moves deep, then it is misleading to pretend that the position can be assessed using general principles.\\" Nunn never says that general principles are wrong; indeed his games all have their lessons - tempered with the knowledge that the tactics have to validate them. The reviewer thinks this \\"is nothing profound\\" but he assumes you should be on general principle autopilot \\"staying in your lane\\" until something concrete causes you to \\"swerve.\\" <br />\\"Note how White was not hamstrung by traditional ideas,\\" Nunn comments at the end the first game, \\"when it was best to abandon the idea of castling, White did so without hesitation...\\" Creative rule-independence and careful calculation are the other half of understanding and playing modern chess that reliance on general principle \\"half-truths\\" ultimately depend on.  If you think that all it means is \\"that there are exceptions to every rule\\" you really don't understand chess, move by move.	2001-06-27

It either has the ring of truth and wit for the reader because the reader shares the beliefs and values of the book or it seems pretentious and overblown. I confess that I loved it. I enjoyed a chess book that didn't look like an algebra text and talked about ego, concentration, materialism and Groucho Marx. I thought there were creative ideas throughout the text. Talking to one's pieces, for example, struck me as helpful - usually I just curse their clumsiness.  My good friend hated this book. He wanted prescriptions, checklists, and forced move variations. It is a matter of taste. I should add that all this psychological \\"stuff\\" might be less  relevant if the reader often overlooks tactical ideas that net the opponent a piece or pawn. It's a luxury to worry about perfectionism or  thinking too much when you're down a piece.	2001-06-15

Is It Helpful?	The majority of the reviews seem to focus on the reviewer's feelings: towards the author, his previous works, &quot;it was too simple,&quot; &quot;too complicated,&quot; &quot;repetitive,&quot; and so on. However, if you're not familiar with mind-maps (which are creative techniques used to organize thoughts, identify key ideas, link themes, and remember more effectively, while using the both sides of the brain), you might think of it as a gimmicky New-Agey concept without practical applications. In other words, not useful, interesting but not useful. I'd just like to give personal endorsement. I've used mind maps for about twenty years to organize engineering projects at work, remember books I've read, identify daily goals, learn chess opening ideas, outline papers I'm writing, and identify the important from the trivial. This book does have flaws in that Buzan has already written it in his earlier works, and the title suggests to more impressive results than can be delivered (&quot;maximize your brain's potential&quot;). You won't become a genius, you will still have to work at thinking, you'll just have an additional tool to help you. Mind maps are fun, easy-to-use, useful ways to organize and retain information and generate ideas. Linear notes just don't jog the memory. It's still amazing to me how a hastily drawn mind map on an article, book, movie, lecture - a map I'll scribble with stupid little drawings and doodles and throw away days later - can help me remember so much years later !! It works. I use it. It helps.	2001-06-10

I thought the book was both educational and interesting. I've gone through the book over a dozen times in the last three months as well as using ChessbaseLite to test myself on these same 300 positions. The positions definitely cover a great deal of topics: elementary tactics, endgames, calculation techniques (when to stop), quiet moves, and so on. I've definitely got my money's worth. HOWEVER, I gave the book 3 stars for two reasons. First, I resented the subtitle's &quot;Most Important Positions&quot; - it is a crude marketing gimmick that implies that you're getting something that you aren't going to get elsewhere and that there is something unique in the book's arrangement - there isn't. This is a tactics book and if you already own a few, don't worry that you're missing some &quot;Russian chess secret&quot; contained here. Second, other reviewers have gone way overboard in praising this book as though it were a comprehensive organized chess guide: it isn't. It is a solid tactics book you don't really need if you have a few already.	2001-06-05

Combined with the slender size of the book, the diagrams and easy-to-find solutions make this a very convenient book to carry around. I am a rated USCF player with an OTB rating that ranges from 1750-1850 and found most of the problems rather simple but NOT trivial - these are problems and combinations that are far more likely to be encountered in my games (and yours?) than some of those amazing 5-8 move stunners.

Were they our ancestors? What was their geographic range? How many were there? When did they disappear? Did modern humans eliminate them?  And so on. Tattersall discusses cranial shapes and skeletal remains, other human ancestors, genetics, stone tools, cave bears, and what have you. There are plenty of photographs of skeletons, skulls, tools, maps, and plenty of sidebar topics. This is a great book for intelligent laypeople of all ages and I greatly recommend it.	2001-05-20

Instead, I found an articulate and thoughtful academic approach to the historical roots of American racism, interesting anecdotes about systemic racism's &quot;current realities&quot; in everyday practice and possible anti-racist strategies and solutions. Feagin's ideological sympathies are clearly with the victims of racism but not, I think, to the extent that it distorts history or unfairly attacks one race. The book isn't about &quot;attacking&quot; one group unless you define attacking as recounting historical facts or current reality. So why did the other reviewer find it so offensive? The title - Racist America - implies to the superficial reader that all (White) Americans are racist and the subject - racism - is unpleasant and embarassing to the superficial reader (&quot;Why not forget the bad and accentuate the positive?&quot;). If you're reading a book, for example, on cancer, or poverty, or famine, you don't get angry, thrown down the book and say, &quot;I don't have cancer. Most people aren't poor. Famines are rare,&quot; you recognize that that is the subject of the book.  This book does not condemn America but its focus is on our national original sin and its enough to make anyone squeamish.	2001-05-12

I like how Chernev uses extended game fragments and his own enthusiastic commentary to explain the combinations. I have several tactics books and I enjoyed Chernev's less common approach to combinations: most books just give the position as though it just &quot;appeared&quot; out of the blue to settle the game. Somehow with Chernev, I get the idea that you have to work to get there. Descriptive notation.	2001-05-03

The main differences, I think, are:   <br />                                                  1) Chernev's is much more basic, even though Understanding Chess &quot;avoids jargon&quot; and &quot;emphasizes general principles&quot; Nunn still writes more in-depth textually and doesn't avoid long variations. <br />2) Nunn is less repetitive - he doesn't try to come up with a dozen different reasons for why 1 e4 or 1 d4 &quot;is the best move on the board,&quot; he just refers you to game 1, and moves on.<br />3) Nunn's games reflect current theory and modern openings which are a bit more sophisticated (or at least not as readily comprehensible) and require more explanation than Chernev's. <br />I enjoyed Understanding Chess (the writing, variations, thematic ideas, summaries)  but I think it is a bit too much for younger players or newcomers so if you haven't read Logical Chess or found it too hard (or **shudder** boring) you might do well to wait awhile before trying Understanding Chess. Understanding Chess is like a college textbook while Logical Chess' is a high school workbook.	2001-04-27

We're (the reviewers) mostly in agreement here that this guide doesn't do enough &quot;right&quot; (like faction strategies, unit design, etc.) and does too much &quot;wrong&quot; (like trivial descriptions of already available game info with little or no explanations of how a player might best make use of the info). I would have appreciated a book half as thick but with  opinions on the how and why for designing well-equipped armed forces, choosing government types, allocating research, and so on.	2001-04-01

This isn't fatal to McWhorter's premises or his conclusions (which have already been discussed by other reviewers) but does make them less convincing - even though as a former Berkeley/Stanford student, I agreed with him. With notable exceptions, there does seem to be in the black community a certain anti-intellectual strain (one that, I think, is also shared by the larger American society) that does not place a high premium on academics and its associated costs: long, slow, time-consuming study. You disagree? Then why aren't African-Americans, who are 12%-13% of the population, equally represented in the &quot;hard&quot; sciences?  Where are those missing tens of thousands of African-American engineers, scientists, computer specialists, doctors, etc.? I don't think its because Blacks are not capable. My anecdote? Having been an engineering student at Berkeley and a graduate student at Stanford, I noticed that my African-American classmates were far less likely to speak in class, participate in study groups, or be seen late in the evenings at the labs. Yes, I know, someone will say they'd been discouraged from talking, excluded from study sessions, lock out of labs, but it must have been a very subtle racism which I never noticed directed against me. I believe that African-American students can be the intellectual equals of anyone - but if the other students are staying up late studying, seeing the professor during office hours and meeting with other students - they will lag behind. As a graduate assistant, I rarely had my African-American students seek my help while I practically had my Asian-American students lined up at the door. Maybe I sent out negative vibes?	2001-03-09

This is not a &quot;picture book&quot; that just happens to have some writing in-between photos: Tim Ripley writes lucid prose that is both informative and engaging. Having seen too many East Front military books that are just excuses to publish some tank/infantry pictures, I appreciated Ripley's skill with the written word and agreed with much of his interpretation of the Waffen SS's role on the East Front including the observation that the Nazi reign of terror (my words)  might have ended sooner had not the Waffen SS fought at Kharhov and Zhitomir.	2001-02-27

This book is divided into two parts: the first contains problems covering the opening (11 positions), middlegame (12 positions), and endgame (18 positions) and the second consists of 16 self-test games (similar to How Good is Your Chess or Solitaire Chess from Chess Life).<br />The problems are very difficult, maybe too difficult for most players. For comparison, I have an over-the-board USCF rating thats varied between 1750-1850 (which is at least 80th percentile) and I found most of the problems frustrating. However, Pedersens solutions and annotations are convincing: his effort shows and I did feel I learned something.<br />The How Good Is Your Chess? section with its sixteen games is slightly easier going but not to be rushed through. If youve sped through Chess Lifes Solitaire Chess with good results, youll be surprised at how difficult these games are. The games deserve close to tournament length amounts of time to solve, so much so that I almost felt that I had been the player.<br />If youre sure youre a strong player or highly motivated, than this book might be for you. If youre relatively lower-rated, or looking for more casual combination books, I think youd be disappointed here.	2001-02-27

The human being behind the entertainer, I thought, might have an interesting story to tell. However, what we get are, for the most part, anecdotes. A series of events strung together to pad out a book. Filler. What, for example, does it matter that Chyna was (supposedly) asked to leave the &quot;Drew Carey&quot; TV show filming because of the alledged jealosy of an unnamed actress? So what? It's there to take up space. BFD. How important, for understanding who Chyna is, is it to learn about the poor performance of her bodybuilding competitors? Basically, this book feels like cheap exploitation of Chyna's fifteen minutes of celebrity written to make a quick buck. Chyna was poorly served by this extended-magazine-article excuse for a book. Its a shame that the meaningful and the irrelevant aspects of her life were thrown together in this fashion. Wait for this book to be in the bargain bin rather than pay full retail. You won't be sorry.	2001-02-25

Epic  Account	Having read a great many military history books, nonfiction and nonfiction, I think Clark's account to be one of the better written ones - at least in terms of narrative style and accomplishment of purpose. Clark covers a lot of territory in a single volume, and does so without the assuming the reader wants or needs to know if the Red Army XXIII Guards Tank Corps was at 85% strength or 93%, or if the German XXXIX Mechanized Division had 35 operational tanks or only 29. This is a book that will be picked apart by purists or by those whining &quot;well, it's hate-filled&quot; because the author mentions German atrocities on the Eastern Front. I think it's relatively unbiased, and this is borne out by other reviewers who either claim that the author was &quot;sympathetic&quot; to the Nazi's or that the author wrote &quot;another hate-filled&quot; anti-German book. If you're looking for another &quot;heroic German soldiers&quot; epic or the far rarer &quot;Russian&quot; point-of-view work, look elsewhere. This book is far too middle of the road to be defined either way. It is however excellent reading for that inbetween reader who can then decide whether or not to get the so-called &quot;up-to-date&quot; books.	2001-02-20

It is a powerfully written narrative of the battle for Stalingrad as experienced by combatant and noncombatants for both sides. I thought it to be superior to most historical &quot;military&quot; writing in general: this is a book to be read not for orders of battle and eye glazing sentences of roman numeral lists of panzer divisions but for a dramatic, immersive, account of a German Army entering a prostrate town expecting a rapid collapse and finding to its surprise die-hard Russian soldiers who were not quite ready to surrender. I read this book twenty years ago when I was fifteen and regretted losing my copy years ago. I am glad the book is back. P.S. the sniper duel is a part of the story but only a part...	2001-02-19

I think it is one of the best works of its type, for attention to overall historical detail as well as  to the personal experience of individual German soldiers, Russian soldiers and civilians. Years after losing my copy, I am glad to be able to reread this book again. And I intend to hang on to it this time. Now if only Martin Caidin's The Tigers Are Burning would be reprinted!	2001-02-17

I am rated 1801 USCF and I still found the book both interesting and useful. Sadler surveys many chess themes in a style that will neither bore nor frighten &quot;younger&quot; (and/or newcomer) players. For instance, in the middlegame chapter, he clearly explains the dynamics of developing a plan, implementing it, changing course when necessary, and so on. I think that this slender volume will be one that you can finish without dreading it as &quot;study.&quot; Then you'll be ready for the really hard stuff. Or not, since you'll already have enough info to crush casual players - if you're into that.	2001-02-06

On the positive side, the book has a conversational style: readable and not &quot;heavy-on-variations&quot; suitable,I think,for players relatively new to middlegame study. There are plenty of examples, verbal explanations, and chapter summaries that do not overwhelm the reader(who,I believe, unlike the other reviewer, would be rated much less than 1800 USCF). You're very likely to finish this book cover to cover. On the negative side, I would have expected to find a more (if superficial) coverage of all the basic middlegame themes. For example, the topic of pawn structures is given very little attention. Isolated queen pawns do not begin to exhaust pawn structures! I also felt that the model games do not necessarily have much to do with the associated &quot;problems-to-solved&quot; that follow them. Similarly, the section on &quot;not playing by rote&quot; gives three games that actually give the opposite impression in that the winners may have won BECAUSE of rote memory of earlier analysis of the variation played. I enjoyed the book as a review of some middlegame topics but it is not comprehensive nor especially valuable for any but advanced beginners. I am rated 1810 U.S.C.F. and I think that is the extreme high range of appropriateness for this book.	2001-01-16

Even though I already own a few &quot;great chess games&quot; books, I feel this is an awesome addition to my library. This is a book that not only entertains but educates. I enjoyed the verbal explanations of plans, move orders, and thematic summaries of &quot;lessons learned.&quot; I felt confident that the authors had not simply rewritten previous annotators' analysis' but checked detailed move variations for tactical flaws (with computer assistance not available in the past). For example, the Reti-Alekhine (Baden-Baden, 1925) game is analysed by the Grandmaster authors with the help of computer chess software, not to diminish Alekhine's abilities but to aid in seeing how complicated the game was. I finished the book with a better appreciation of the accomplishments of world-class players and I would recommend this book to advanced beginners and beyond.	2001-01-03

You should be aware that opening theory and endgames are not particularly or specifically covered by &quot;Power Chess&quot; except in so far as they are related to other themes like &quot;attacking the uncastled king&quot; and so on. The book also assumes that you're not a complete novice and know some basic principles,maxims, etc., so probably an advanced beginner/weak intermediate player is best suited for the text. I enjoyed this book, used it, improved a bit, and recommend it. No book will teach you everything but I think &quot;Power Chess&quot; has no serious omissions and plenty of valuable info.	2000-12-03

Wired magazine's review calling this book &quot;a unified field theory of kookiness&quot; is right on the money. I think that the book's incredible claims and statements mark the author as either a truly knowledgeable individual, a raving lunatic, or a cynical opportunist, with my money on the lunatic.

For example, the  recommended White variation against the French Defence: 1 e4 e5 2 d4 d5 3  Be3 dxe4 4 Nd2 Nf6 5 f3 was easily handled by my 1450 opponent: 5... Nd5 6  Qe2 Nxe3 7 Qxe3 exf3 8 Ngxf3 Be7 which turned out to be the same response  Watson gives in &quot;Play the French&quot; with the comment &quot;White  has no compensation.&quot; Often, you don't even get the fun of having the  initiative or an attack to compensate you for your sacrificed material! If  you buy this book, be aware that you'll often be more hard-pressed proving  your gambit's worth than your opponent will be proving it faulty. This will  happen often because you're given (with certain notable exceptions, like  the anti-Pirc defence) only two or three pages of info. However, for  non-aggressive players like myself, there is  a training benefit to be  gained from openings that force you to play aggressive sharp moves to avoid  winding up a pawn (or two) down in an unwinnable endgame and to that  extent, this book is worth it. Just don't expect to win because of these  openings.	2000-07-13

I found Crouch's writing and analysis to be  as interesting as the moves themselves! I think this book would be an  excellent companion to the author's &quot;Attacking Technique.&quot;  Friends, I'll admit I still play as badly as I ever have (barely 1800 USCF)  and doubt whether any single book will raise your (or my) rating &quot;x  points&quot; but I think you'll find valuable practical knowledge here. You  might also read the excellent (and inexpensive) &quot;Art Of The  Middlegame&quot; by Keres/Kotov, for a beautiful, concise chapter on  defence.	2000-07-04
