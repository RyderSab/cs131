This thing costs $18.17 at Amazon.com.... If you want to buy this Amazon is the place to buy this!<br />The success journal is set up to help you (1) establish goals (2) follow the eating & fitness routines (3) provide inspiration during the 12 week challenge and (4) hopefully transform your life after completing a 12 week program.  <br />Having finished a 12 week program in 2001 and, having failed to finish 3 prior programs, I can say that this journal should help people start and complete a program. The journal would probably be of little value to those that haven't read the book but, if you are planning to buy the book and follow the plan you should pick up a copy of this Journal.<br />As part of the Journal you are forced to record your planned vs. actual results for fitness, food and daily goals each and EVERY day. This thing truly forces the program upon you, which is a good thing for many who feel they might lack the discipline to complete such a program.  The book truly enables people to measure their results on a daily basis and track their progress throughout the entire program.  <br />Body for Life, like any other fitness/health plan, will only allow you to get results based on your effort. If you gorge yourself with food or don't exercise like he says, don't expect to get the kind of results that people in his book have gotten.<br />Body For Life, while it is somewhat a promotional vehicle for EAS Myoplex, is a very sound book on nutrition and exercise. Most importantly, Mr. Phillips tries to get people to look within themselves and try to find out what they want out of a fitness program and goals in life. It is definitely a combination of self-help book meets exercise. Mr Phillips applies bodybuilding concepts (6 meals a day, weightlifting and cardio) and has tweaked them somewhat so that non-bodybuilders can get excellent results out of the program in a very short period of time.<br />Regarding nutrition - 6 meals a day - this is recommended to keep insulin levels more level throughout the day and to help shuttle nutrients to your cells. He also has a \\"free day\\" once a week where he tells people to eat whatever they want (pizza, cheeseburgers, whatever your weakness is :.)<br />His 20 minute cardio sessions, entitled HIIT (high intensity interval training), can really work a person hard and are great for those that have every excuse about not having enough time in the day.<br />His \\"high point\\" mentioned when lifting weights is what weightlifting is all about. It is why bodybuilders get phenomenal results and the average guy (who works out daily) may look the same year after year. Lifting weights is key to long-term metabolism - the avg. person loses 0.7 pounds of muscle after the age of 25, which contributes to why we gain weight. We lose muscle naturally and continue to eat (normally more) while exercising less as we get used to our jobs!<br />Bottom Line: If you are interested in your health you aren't going to go wrong following the plan. In 2001 I dropped 50 pounds from my peak weight before putting about 15 back on.  -bodybuilders can get excellent results out of the program in a very short period of time.<br />Regarding nutrition - 6 meals a day - this is recommended to keep insulin levels more level throughout the day and to help shuttle nutrients to your cells.

Such information is available at their website.  I rank this book a solid 5 star book because the insights / examples provided far outweigh any concerns / problems I found with the book.  This book caused me to look at advertising / marketing from a different perspective in my daily life which is what I use to evaluate if something is a 5 star book<br />I loved The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding for the following reasons:<br />1. It flat out states the importance of marketing & branding, which is important to separate in the readers' mind before beginning.  As they state \\"Marketing is building a brand in the mind of the prospect. If you can build a powerful brand you will have a powerful marketing program. If you can't, then all the advertising, fancy packaging, sales promotion and public relations in the world won't help you achieve your objective.\\"<br />2. The Ries' call it like they see it.  Excellent examples of marketing / advertising stupidity / effectiveness are provided.<br />3. They talk about the plethora of products that are produced each year.<br />4. They discuss how businesses must get inside a consumer's mind (AKA positioning) to win the war.  Volvo = safety, BMW = Ultimate Driving Machine, Mercedes = prestige, Toyota = Reliability, Ford = ?, Chevy = ?.  The Ries' clearly spell out an excellent reason as to why the U.S. automanufacturers are getting killed.<br />5. The book illustrates, as did the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, how companies dilute their brands through line extensions (I personally believe this due to my personal experience / buying patterns and observations of others.)<br />6. They point out the increasing importance of PR (public relations) compared to advertising.  This is the subject of a new book by the father / daughter.  Basically PR launches a product and advertising gives it life support is their main assertion.<br />I disliked The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding for the following reasons:<br />1. Overlap from prior books is definitely occurring.  I have noticed this with Jack Trout's recent books too. I would estimate that 15% - 20%, at a minimum, of Trout's recent books and this book have been stated in one form or another in their prior works.<br /><br />2. Some of the examples provide clearly refute other examples provided.  On page 100 they state \\"the Mustang and former CEO of Chrysler Corporation (two powerful brand names.)  In prior examples the authors clearly state that the brand is the maker of the company.  Volvo = safety, BMW = driving machine, etc (you will find such features in all their vehicles -maybe not in Volvos convertible.)  What does Chrysler stand for again?  Minivans?  I haven't exactly noticed it in their advertising......for a long time...<br />Conclusion:  Buy the book.  It is well worth the time and money.  Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website. If you are interested in another good marketing book I highly recommend Differentiate or Die by Jack Trout or Seth Godin's book on permission marketing / launching an ideavirus.  If you are interested in other subjects I would encourage you to read The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner if you are interested in economic history - the book is international in scope and deals with the lives and times of the most famous economists in history. If you are interested in economic development / evolution of U.S. property history I would encourage you to read Hernando DeSoto's Mystery of Capital but note his lack of focus on corruption in certain countries.

The world wide web is truly transforming the global economy despite what the stock market might be stating.  I would highly recommend this book for those not familiar with formal marketing strategy or those seeking to learn more about the Internet and various business opportunities available.  Some excellent marketing books / concepts quoted include the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Influence, Permission Marketing and Viral marketing buzz marketing or word of mouth.<br />The new economy is knowledge based and based on expansive communication networks that grow in importance as related groups / interested parties meet each other and conduct business.  Mr. Allen clearly understands this and I give him kudos for pursuing such an endeavor.<br />Here are the pros and cons of the books.....a personal opinion:<br />Pros:<br />1. The book is very broad and talks about sales, marketing and advertising, which is rare in such books<br />2. The book provides Allens example via his business.<br />3. The book was well written<br />4. Many excellent marketing books are quoted.<br />Cons<br />1. This book is a sales pitch.  Mr. Allen clearly has sales copy experience which makes the book interesting but definitely somewhat misleading. He knows what he is doing and he has a VERY successful marketing / product track record.  As a result, he is very successful in his Internet trials / examples.  He has customers that already know about him, have purchased his products for the last 20 years and others that are interested.  He doesnt mention this in the book enough and marketing costs are a HUGE variable cost to businesses.  This will likely result in readers being too optimistic about their ability to generate wealth on the web.<br />2. The book was written by several co-authors.  It seems as though Allen, in a rush to get the book out, heavily relied on so called experts within various parts of Internet Marketing.<br />3. He plugs various peoples products that are not that good.  I have perused many of these products and it is hit and miss.  Some are good and some are not so good.<br />My final thoughts on the book are this:  Read it.  It is worth the time for beginners.  For those seeking a wide exposure to marketing/advertising/sales in an Internet world it is well worth it.  There are some pitfalls though that I cant overemphasize.<br />Any business, irregardless of distribution channel, is a lot of work.  Internet businesses require hard work, lots of sweat, lots of perseverance, lots of testing, lots of learning and, for those interested, they can be very fulfilling opportunities.  If you are trying to make major money or simply pursue a hobby online via a personal website this book is worth reading.<br />Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website.

I rarely give five star ratings anymore because a \\"paradigm shift\\" or excellent insights are needed to get such a review.  This book deserves the five star rating.<br />Differentiate or Die by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin is an excellent read for those learning how and why businesses succeed in the LONG-TERM.  This book is another excellent marketing book by one of the authors.  Jack Trout first came to popularity with his seminal book \\"Positioning,\\" which he co-wrote with Al Ries.  For those interested in marketing books The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout is another truly great book by one of the authors.<br />Differentiation is the key element to long-term success and profits; furthermore, it is an essential area of discussion in any corporate strategy discussions and is frankly the biggest and most important thing I learned while getting my MBA a few years ago.<br />Some excellent tidbits from the book include:<br />* It's not simply about what you or your product can do; it's about what you do differently from everyone else.  Very similar to concepts introduced in Positioning, one of the co-authors other books<br />* In today's global marketplace there are more products than ever.  Products compete globally rather than locally or nationally as they did in the past.<br />* In today's lightning-fast rate of change it is critical to be first to market with an invention but it is MORE IMPORTANT to be first to market to position yourself in the marketplace via advertising / marketing to capture customer MINDSHARE.<br />* It is tougher than ever to get customer's to change their minds as they increasingly have less time to shop on discretionary products or plan vacations due to the increasing reliance on double income households.<br />* Trout concentrates on illustrating ideas that will differente you from the pack: Being first (and staying there), owning a discernible attribute, having a heritage, becoming the preference of a particular consumer group, or even being the most recent arrival in a product arena are just some of these useful differentiates he presents.<br />Conclusion:  Buy the book.

I find that my focus in reading is increasingly turning towards history, the issue of worldwide standards of living and how economic growth in various parts of the world varies so dramatically.<br />Economic Puppetmasters by Lawrence Lindsey, the current economics advisor to the President, is an excellent book for those that are interested in (1) economics (2) the history of monetary policies in various economic areas such as Japan, Europe and the United States and finally, (3) the inextricable link between politics and the economy.<br />I was going to rank this book a solid four star book because it provided some really good analysis.  However, after thinking about it for a day or so, I am deducting a full star from the book (a three star ranking) due to the partisanship rhetoric and a complete lack of attention to the national debt.<br />In my opinion the real value of this book is Lindsey's explanation of why Japan has been in an economic funk for 10 + years.  Another element of excellent insight on his part is that he provides readers with an excellent explanation of the pros and cons of the Euro and difficulties that will likely occur in the next ten years from the establishment of such a central bank / currency.  The book provides readers with a great history lesson into various monetary regimes.<br />In my opinion Mr. Lindsey, like many financial authors, is HIGHLY deficient in one key area.  He never talks about the U.S. national debt and how it has gone from $960 billion to $5.6 trillion in 20 years.  The explosive growth in the national debt has caused growth rates to be overstated because they are unsustainable.  At the end of the day you have to pay interest on the debt and you have to repay the debt.  What about the fact that America will go from 7 working people per retiree to 2.5 within 20 years?  This will cause social benefits to soar with fewer workers to pay for it?  But Mr. Lindsey doesn't feel this is important.  Instead he takes shots at previous administrations for their \\"deficient views.\\"  You can learn a good amount from reading the book but Mr. Lindsey and the rest of the Politicians / economists disgust me because their desire to get re-elected is going to leave a nation bankrupt or heavily indebted within 20 years.

In saying this, the book was interesting and a good learning process but it didn't cause me to experience a paradigm shift. The Global Economy and the Nation State (ch. 14) saved my rating of the book because it was so insightful. I found much of the book to be filler because a lot of the content can be found in other Drucker books and can be found from chapter to chapter in this book. To put it into perspective, at least four chapters are nothing more than edited interviews with the author that were published in magazines and I kept finding facts / quotes repeated again and again.<br />Managing in the Next Society by Peter Drucker is the latest book by the author. The book is a collection of articles and interviews by Drucker in recent years. More specifically, chapters in this book have originally appeared in The Economist, Red Herring, Business 2.0., Inc. Magazine, New Perspectives, Foreign Affairs magazine, Viewpoint, Leaders to Leader, Atlantic Monthly, The Wall Street Journal and in the Harvard Business Review. So, while I wouldn't be surprised if Drucker fans have read one or two of these chapters via magazines I would be surprised if any reader has read most of the content before publication of this book.<br />The book is segmented into four different sections. They are: The Information Society, Business Opportunities, The Changing World Economy and The Next Society. Each section has approximately 60 - 80 pages of text and the book is easy to read, as most Drucker books are.<br />If you haven't read anything by the author before don't start here. I would personally recommend new readers of Peter Drucker start with The Essential Drucker as it stands as the authors best work (it is a collection of his best works from over 60 years of writing.) Other Excellent works by the author are Post Capitalist Society, The Age of Discontinuity, The Effective Executive & Innovation and Entrepreneurship.<br />Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website.

Having left Wall Street over a year ago I am amazed at how little attention the media, Wall Street & the Fed have given to Deflation.  In my opinion the probability of a deflationary scenario is higher than ever.  This book helps you prepare for such tumultuous economic times.  I rank it a 5 star book, an increasingly rare rating for me.  I gave this book five stars due to the excellent analysis and insightful commentary about what occurs in deflation and, more importantly, the graphical depictions the book has throughout it.  It would be ignorant to mention that Mr. Shilling has been talking about deflation non-stop since the late 80's - especially after the '87 stock market crash.  Can anyone remember the story about the boy who cried \\"WOLF!\\" too many times?<br />Talking finance without graphs is tough for the reader so I give kudos to Mr. Shilling in this regard.<br />As I like to say (and Mr. Shilling points this out), the 1980's was the age of government spending.  The 1990's was the age of the consumer buying binge as individual debt levels have soared.  The average person has $8500 in credit card debt vs. 2500 in 1990 to put it into perspective.<br />Moving forward, what will drive top-line growth in worldwide sales?  - Did you know that the G-8 countries account for roughly 80% of total purchases worldwide and, as a result, weakness in those countries dramatically affects the world economy?<br />Will we end up with too much capacity due to stagnant growth or a retraction in corporate spending?<br />What will be the catalyst to drive economic growth? - The government has over $5 trillion in debt, corporations and individuals are tapped out and factories are running at about 76% of their utilization right now.<br />Buy the book........Read the book........Anyone can learn from this........By the way, bond prices have already soared so the easy money in bonds has been made.........<br />...If you are interested in economic history book I would encourage everyone to read The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner since it is more international in scope and deals with the lives and times of the most famous economists in history.

I have read two of Mr. Fox's books and really like his writing style.  That is why, when I recently decided to rejoin the workforce, I decided to pick up this book.  I had a feeling I would get some unique insights into job hunting from this book and I wasn't disappointed.  While the insights were valuable I didn't find anything \\"earth shattering\\" and the book definitely didn't cause me to experience a paradigm shift so I rank it 4 out of 5 stars.<br />The basic theme of the book is to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack through specialized resumes, creating \\"resuletters\\" and gathering information about the target company.  Mr. Fox basically looks at job hunting from a sales and marketing perspective, which is his primary career experience.  As I was reading this book the comments / insights from it basically reminded me of the sales and marketing books I have read over the years.  The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Jack Trout was the best marketing book I have read in recent years, in case anyone was interested.<br /><br />A key element to this book, which should not be overlooked, is that Mr. Fox clearly understands what business is about.  At the end of the day do you provide value to an employer?  Does your position save them money, generate sales, help develop new products?  More importantly, can you put a dollar value on your importance to a corporation? Are you focusing on providing value to customers or worried about you, you, you.  At the end of the day corporations have to make money.  If they don't they go bankrupt.  Employees that deliver tons of value tend to have promising and long lasting careers with companies they like.<br />Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website.

I didn't rank the book with a five star rating because it didn't cause me to have a \\"paradigm shift\\" or see the world from a different perspective.  However, those interested in American History or economic history should thoroughly enjoy this book.  I loved reading the book because Mr. Gordon's work clearly shows his in-depth knowledge of American history and his excellent storytelling capabilities.<br />These 47 articles, gathered from Gordon's 10 years as an American Heritage columnist, cover the post-Revolutionary period through the 1950s.  Each article is written, as the title portrays, from an American perspective.  Mr. Gordon talks, for example, about the railroads and the characters behind them in the American boom but rarely does he specifically address who invented a product / technology, unless an American did.  Additionally, I found that little attention was given to air conditioning, as it has impacted migration patterns dramatically in the U.S.<br />...	2002-06-15

If you buy this book you will find yourself delighted by the easy read and may think you have found a gem but most parables are simply overpriced information.  Let me elaborate further.<br />This book, like other parables, are a great read for the following reasons.<br />* It is a quick read. I read it in about 2 - 3 hours and I am a fairly slow reader.<br />* The book is able to illustrate one point extremely effectively. For example, in this book they show how we tend to associate negative or positive feelings to individuals or situations and it affects our quality of life due to the way that we interact with people.<br />* These are the kinds of books that employees will read (great for training programs) as they are 100-200 pages in length and easy to read so a massive investment of time and energy isn't required by employees.<br />The simple theme illustrated in this book is that both whales and people perform better when you accentuate the positive.  It is tougher to actually implement such behavior but it can be done and it can have a substantial impact on your life if you learn the tools and key behaviors to look for and modify in your life.  The problem with this parable is that they give the reader very few tools to work with and actual exercises to implement.  As a result, it is difficult for 95% of the people who read this to actually integrate this into their lives for the long-term.<br />Psychologists have been talking about this for decades in what they term \\"neurolinguistic programming.\\"  People are attracted to what they have positive experiences with and try to avoid painful or uncomfortable situations.  Pain=bad, pleasure = good.<br />My concluding thoughts: If you read this book try and seek out some other resource that will help you form the concepts into habits.  Most experts say that it takes 21 days of continual implementation for something to begin forming a habit amongst people.<br />[....]ual implementation for something to begin forming a habit amongst people. <br />[....]	2002-06-15

In particular I was hoping to see if the author did a good job in relating economics to other areas such as politics, science, sociology, history philosophy and mathematics and the book fulfilled my desire.  The book was well written, in terms of prose, making it an easy book to read economics books, especially for non-economists.<br />If I had anything to gripe it would be the EXTREMELY poor editing.  Throughout the book I found words that had mistakenly been split up by a spac e mark, such as what I have included in this review.  One or two can be forgiven but the twenty or so I seem to have come across is truly shameful for a book at approximately $20 or more.  As a result of this and the poor examples provided I rate the book a 3 star book<br />This book, like The Worldly Philosophers and New Ideas from Dead Economists, is designed to illustrate the thoughts and history of the world's greatest economic thinkers.  Economists.  This book is ideal for those seeking to learn about some of the contributions of the world's greatest economists as well as those who are history buffs and want to learn more about the times / overlap of the world's greatest minds in other areas such as philosophy, science, etc as many of these individuals had an impact on economists of their times.<br />Economists highlighted in the book, which goes in chronological order from past to recent, include Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Robert Malthus, George Marshall, Thorton Veblen, Joseph Schumpeter, John von Neumann, John Nash and Milton Friedman.<br />Some historic events mentioned in the book, since they affected the economists' thoughts, are Holland's 17th-century bout of tulipmania, Britain's notorious South Sea Bubble, The French Revolution, the Great Depression, and the rebuilding and retribution strategies following the two world wars.<br />Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them.  If you are interested in another excellent economics book I would start with The Worldly Philosophers (which I would buy before this book) and then read Hernando DeSoto's Mystery of Capital.  A great general business book is by the management guru Peter Drucker entitled \\"The Essential Drucker\\".  Just so you know, he didn't pick the title but his work is excellent and highly applicable for managers.<br />One final note, The Mystery Of Capital is a highly regarded, easy to read book on economic development that is VERY popular in the offices of dignitaries throughout the world, including Paul O'Neill (Secretary of State for the U.S).

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it reflected political, economic and technological changes / revolutions that have occurred in the past century.  At the end of the day I found myself consumed by the book and wanting to read beyond what my eyes would allow me to do (late night reading!)<br />The book, at 352 pages, is deceptively small since each page is not a 6.72 x 5.58 in dimension.  However, I spent a good 12-14 hours reading the book to completion as the book doesn't present pictures and tables as \\"filler.\\"<br />If you want to learn about the most recent century this is a good book for you to read.  If you want to read some good history books predating the 20th century I highly recommend 2 of Isaac Asimov's books, Chronology of the World and Chronology of Science and Discovery.<br />Some of the events mentioned in this book, just for reference are:<br />* Hitler and Germany<br />* Mao and his revolutions in China<br />* Technological innovations such as air conditioning which have caused huge changes to population movements and building construction.<br />* The discovery of penicillin.<br />* The invention of plastic.<br />* McNamara & The Diner's club - the first credit card.<br />* Cuban Missile Crisis<br />* Martin Luther King<br />* Woodstock<br />Anyways, I enjoyed the book but nothing presented changed my paradigm or the way I look at the world so I give it 4 stars out of 5.  The book was truly interesting for those who simply want to get a better grasp of what an amazing century it truly was.  Think about this...The automobile, plane and highway system weren't around before this century.  Just think about the implications that those 3 items have had on your life and business as we know it, on a country and global basis.	2002-05-09

Tales: Real-Life Stories to Help You Transform Your Workplace and Your Life	Books	4	61	63	N	N	Better than the original - real world examples are great!	FISH! TALES is a follow up book to the bestseller FISH!  For many who read the first book, you will find the fundamental philosophy repeated again but it is needed because the authors have designed this book to stand alone on its own merits.  If you haven't read the original you can read this book and understand the principles.<br />I personally think that reading the original book first is best.  Just my opinion.<br />If you choose to read the original book (only 130 pages or so) you understand the basic principles of the FISH! Philosophy and what the goals are.  The goals of this book are the same as the first........As the authors put it in the first book \\"Enclosed are the keys to creating an innovative and accountable work environment where a playful, attentive, and engaging attitude leads to more energy, enthusiasm, productivity, and creativity.\\"<br />Doesn't that line above ring of salesmanship?  The authors are selling to senior managers the supposed benefits of their book...just something to think about...<br />While FISH! was written in a parable (short story using fictional characters) format FISH TALES is not.  This book is much different than the first and I personally enjoyed this book much more than FISH!<br />In this book the four points to the philosophy are repeated.<br />The four key points of the philosophy are:<br />* Play - have fun and create energy at home or at the office.<br />* Make their day - how can you engage fellow employees, customers and make each other's day?<br />* Be Present - How can you make sure you are fully available and aware during conversations with people?  It is about create a greater sense of intimacy between individuals.<br />* Choose Your Attitude - Each day you choose how you are going to act or which \\"side of the bed\\" you wake up on.  The choice is yours and, the way you act, affects others.<br />Where this book differs is the following:<br />* They provide REAL WORLD examples of how companies have implemented the FISH! Philosophy.  I personally felt as though the first book was HIGHLY deficient in that sector.<br />* They interview senior managers who convey that they must \\"practice what they preach\\" and be committed to the program.<br />* They show real world examples of how employees began trusting managers and how critical it is in the whole process.<br />* They give you a 12-week roadmap to success.  I believe this is critical to the success of implementing such a philosophy<br />This book, like its predecessor, is a great read for the following reasons.<br />* It is a quick read.  I read it in about 2 - 3 hours and I am a fairly slow reader.<br />* The book is able to illustrate one point extremely effectively.  For example, in this book they show how workers attitudes can impact a setting and how many of us don't understand how our attitude impacts our work setting and quality of life.<br />* These are the kinds of books that employees will read (great for training programs) as they are 100-200 pages in length and easy to read so a massive investment of time and energy isn't required by employees.<br />My concluding thoughts:  I think this book does a better job than its predecessor in conveying key elements but it still never spells out the reason why most management programs fail.  I really enjoyed reading the book.  I think the book made some inroads from its predecessor through more illustrations and another 40 pages of writing.  I still think they just need to convey a basic point to readers.  That point is \\"If top managers don't cooperate or \\"practice what they preach\\" or understand why and how this philosophy works it goes nowhere, just like most management programs designed to attain all of the above mentioned goals of productivity, energy, etc.<br />If you want a great book on business principles I highly encourage everyone to read \\"The Essential Drucker\\" by Peter Drucker.

FISH is written in a parable (short story using fictional characters) format, reminiscent of the style apparent in the classic, bestseller The One Minute Manager.  The goal of the FISH Philosophy is to learn how to boost morale and improve operational results in a business organization.  As the authors put it \\"Enclosed are the keys to creating an innovative and accountable work environment where a playful, attentive, and engaging attitude leads to more energy, enthusiasm, productivity, and creativity.\\"<br />The four key points of the philosophy are:<br />* Play - have fun and create energy at home or at the office.<br />* Make their day - how can you engage fellow employees, customers and make each other's day?<br />* Be Present - How can you make sure you are fully available and aware during conversations with people?  It is about create a greater sense of intimacy between individuals.<br />* Choose Your Attitude - Each day you choose how you are going to act or which \\"side of the bed\\" you wake up on.  The choice is yours and, the way you act, affects others.<br />In my opinion, this business parable, like the rest of them, is great and horrible at the same time.<br />It is a great read for the following reasons:<br />1. It is a quick read.  I read it in about 2 - 2.5 hours and I am a fairly slow reader.<br />2. The book is able to illustrate one point extremely effectively.  For example, in this book they show how workers attitudes can impact a setting and how many of us don't understand how our attitude impacts our work setting and quality of life.<br />3. These are the kinds of books that employees will read as they are 100-150 pages in length and easy to read so a massive investment of time and energy isn't required by employees.<br />It is a poor book for the following reasons:<br />1. The authors never give you ways to implement the ideas.  Once I was done reading the book I was thinking, \\"WOW, this is great stuff.  Now how do I implement it in my company and, more importantly, what will it take for this to be successful.\\"  Which leads me to the next point...<br />2. While they illustrate certain key elements in the book they neglect to mention that:<br />  a. Employees must trust management.<br />  b. Top managers must be fully committed and \\"practice what<br />  they preach.\\"<br />  c. Both of the above points are conveyed in the story but<br />  the authors don't tell you about the importance of what<br />  academics term \\"social capital\\" in an organization.<br />My concluding thoughts:  This is a brief, simple, but elegant book that is an eye opener for those of us who grew up with notions like: &quot;Work is serious, let's have no fooling around!&quot; or &quot;Profit is 'the only' way to measure business success.&quot;  I commend the authors on conveying this to readers.  HOWEVER, the cons outweigh the pros in this book.  Like I pointed out, I really enjoyed reading the book and thought it was pretty effective in showing how an organization can completely turn around but, at the end of the day, no tools were presented to help the reader understand how to implement the FISH philosophy.

If you have read the best seller One Minute Manager or Leadership and the One Minute Manager it is written in comparable form.  I have read both of the prior books.<br />First off, the book basically talks about customer service (vs. goal setting &amp; reward/punishment in the one minute manager) and how companies need to offer exemplary service to create Raving Fans, as the authors title it. I was simply hoping to get one good idea/thought out of the book and I did.  It was EXCEPTIONALLY easy to read, as I read the 132 pages in about 2.5 - 3 hours total.  The book has a lot of dead space and big font so you aren't getting tons of \\"filler.\\"  The authors try to focus on one business issue and address it succinctly.<br />This book is good and bad depending on what you expect to get out of it.<br />It is good because (1) anyone can read this book (2) customer service is horrible in today's environment so it is timely (3) The book provides great illustrations and (4) The authors get the point across.<br />Having said that, they never talk about the business implications of what the characters do.  They say that customers love their service or product but they negate to talk about the cost implications.  Business is about making money, not being loved by everyone.  I love great service and all the frills but, at the end of the day, I have to make it worth the investment to the business owner.<br />Yes, our economy is very much about selling an experience to someone, but there are cost implications to having carpeted floors in grocery stores and full service gas stations that don't price their gas more expensively.  There are implications to buying a product at another store and selling it at the exact same price to your customer (what about the price of labor?)  In that case you are actually LOSING money, except that the customer is happy.....<br />At the end of the day profits pay for the labor, rent, etc.  Businesses have to make money and this part is really neglected in this book.<br />I love that they focus on the customer and finding out what their needs are but they negate to mention where people are in the food chain.  What does the customer value the most?  Is your business positioned to offer it?  Do you offer headaches or tons of value to the customer are a few questions I think of daily?<br />If anyone is looking for a great business book check out The Essential Drucker by Peter Drucker as it is the best book I have read on management and the role of managers, businesses and individuals within a business.

Books	5	14	16	N	N	The best book on viral marketing and &quot;buzz&quot;	Seth Godin writes about social observations and then applies them to the world of business.  For example, this book is about \\"viral/word of mouth marketing\\" whereas his prior book was about permission based marketing and its impact on communications with customers.  His recently released book, Survival is not Enough, is about \\"survival of the fittest\\" via his Darwinian-like take on business.<br />I read permission marketing some years ago and really enjoyed it as it refreshed my thoughts on customer satisfaction and interaction.  Then, this book came out and it really changed my paradigm about the growth aspect of businesses and how \\"viral marketing\\" could have a profound impact on an upstart Internet companies growth trajectory.  I've read Gladwell's The Tipping Point and I must say, this book is better written and has examples more applicable to business.<br />I found myself reading the book quite quickly as I was consumed by it as it was filled with interesting ideas about how to get people interested in what you have to offer.  The principles mentioned in the book could be applied to anything you do in life that you want others to notice but I found the examples on Internet businesses to be fascinating.  Counter to traditional marketing wisdom,which tries to count,measure,and manipulate the spread of information, Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer,rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to-customer dialogue the ideavirus and cheerfully egg marketers on to create and environment where their ideas can replicate.<br />If you are an aspiring entrepreneur this book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book with a step-by-step approach to marketing but, if you read permission marketing and then this book you will have a VERY THOROUGH understanding about how to market on the Internet and grow your business.<br />Other useful books on marketing that I have read or been recommended include Seth Godin's Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus (both great reads), the 22 immutable laws of marketing by Jack Trout and All Reis (excellent authors and a good read), Robert Cialdini's Influence and Ogilvy on Advertising or Wizard of Ads for help in sales copying.h Godin's Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus (both great reads), the 22 immutable laws of marketing by Jack Trout and All Reis (excellent authors and a good read), Robert Cialdini's Influence and Ogilvy on Advertising or Wizard of Ads for help in sales copying.	2002-03-21

As the title indicates, selling and/or marketing an intangible service is a different process than tangible product marketing.  Mr. Beckworth says, &quot;Marketing is not a department&quot; and he's right--it is your front line (sales people) to your CEO and everyone in between. Everyone at your company is involved in marketing your company-and the author makes sure you get the message. Stop wasting time with ploys that don't work. COMMUNICATE with the consumer and you will see increased sales and market share.<br />This book is not about how to develop a complex marketing design or plan.  What it does offer is quick, easy to read \\"business nuggets\\" that are a page or so in length.  Each observation is a fairly insightful observation about marketing in general but focused towards the service industry.  This book is written in a tone that is simple and down-to-earth rather scholarly or academic and was refreshing to read.<br />As the author writes, most people cannot evaluate the skills of an accountant, or lawyer, or any number of professional services. We often look for tangible proxies that indicate the professional's level of expertise and success (e.g., fancy offices, degrees on the wall, presentation, etc.).<br />If you read this book in its entirety in one session, you are bound to remember nothing in the sea of facts and tidbits.  I've found the best way to read the book is to ponder on a few points every night and/or week, while attempting to apply them to a salient situation in your life. Overall, this book has some interesting and useful insights, and is a good read when you have a few minutes to spare.  The best way to learn from this book is to APPLY it.  Everything doesn't have to occur at once and frankly, I think that this book will be one that I look to in the future when I am looking for snippets of marketing wisdom.<br />Other useful books on marketing that I have read or been recommended include Seth Godin's Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus (both great reads), the 22 immutable laws of marketing by Jack Trout and All Reis (excellent authors and a good read), Robert Cialdini's Influence and Ogilvy on Advertising or Wizard of Ads for help in sales copying.est way to learn from this book is to APPLY it.

This book was an outstanding coverage of the age of the junk bond raiders. Junk bonds were the favorite financial tool of corporate raiders everywhere. The junk bond was also used to finance many new businesses (Donald Trump,Atlantic City and MCI are the most memorable to me). This book also covers Michael the driving force behind Drexel Burnham and the King of the junk bond.<br />The book is focused on the rise and fall of Drexel and the associated personalities of the firm. The author does a very good job of illustrating the power Milken had within Drexel, how his office on the West Coast went from being a backwater to accounting for the bulk of the firms revenue, and how Milken's subsequent removal left Drexel crippled past the point of healing.  I felt that the book does a good job of explaining the brilliance of Milken and the high-yield bond market that he created and nurtured, and the catch-22 that led to his criminalization.<br />At the end of the day I find these kind of books to be financial humor more than anything because 1) these guys worked their butts off (2) made tons of money and then (3) a lot of them lost their shirts, ran into difficulties or (3) ended up in jail.  Yes, they are rich by the boat load but it isn't the way I want to make a living.	2002-03-01

Don't get me wrong; you can start here but the odds of you finishing, if you are a beginner, are slim.<br />Murphy starts with the basics, then goes into more advanced principles and then explains linkage (how certain sectors outperform when others under perform.) He talks about commodities and equities throughout the book and it is a very good evaluation of market trends.  There are tons of graphs to help the reader along.<br />This book definitely covers all the basic aspects of TA: philosophy, chart construction, fundamental vs. technical analysis, trends, major technical pattern recognition, moving averages, oscillators, times cycles, computer trading systems and much more. He also covers different methods of charting, including bar, point and figure and candlestick (be aware that most of the analysis techniques he presents apply to bar charting, not PnF or candlestick).<br />I personally believe that technical analysis should be incorporated into just about any decision-making process when investing for any fund, stock and/or options.  While fundamental analysis should be where most efforts start applied technical analysis can help people in picking entry and exit points to \\"avoid fighting the tape\\" which is a real problem for investors in the market.

US	51789632	R1REXYU3U56YZP	0140173188	536490729	The Money Culture	Books	4	27	32	N	N	Good, entertaining reading about finance issues in the 80's	This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts. The book was consistently funny, insightful, and a good primer on several financial issues that dominated the 1980's.  Most of these articles, for those interested in the authors' chronological history, came after he wrote his groundbreaking financial humor book entitled Liars Poker, which is regarded as a \\"must read\\" for anyone entering into the investment banking industry, particularly in bond trading where we he worked.<br />Mr. Lewis' writing style is great, which is why I read his book entitled Next, another good read if you are interested.  Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it.<br />The topics are a wide array and include stories about the domestic S&amp;L scandal, some events that occurred in the French Bourse (their word for a stock market), the proliferation of the American Express Card during the 1980s, some offshore banking insights, Louis Rukeyser, Donald Trump, LBO stories and some comments on the Japanese capitalists.  Like I said, he talks about a wide array of topics but remember that the book is a compilation of many articles.<br />I give it a 4 star rating.  It was highly entertaining but nothing that caused my life to change or caused me to have a \\"light bulb\\" go off in my head.	2002-02-28

I found his various rules of thumb with respect to each industry (retail, restaurants, cyclicals) helpful<br />I say it is poor because Lynch himself used to buy and sell stocks frequently.  So while he says \\"buy and hold\\" he did that, but he also traded the heck out of stocks he knew inside and out.  When they got expensive, he would trim his position and when something got really cheap he would buy the heck out of it.  This enabled him to compound his returns by a phenomenal amount<br />Lynch primarily invested in retail stocks.  This was great as brand names and the \\"homogenization\\" of retail concepts via chain stores was sweeping the nation with the baby boom wave.  However, most of that \\"easy money\\" was made along time ago.  Current baby boom themes of biotech, health care, along with some financial service industry stuff is tougher to make money at and it doesn't grow as fast as retail.  Well, biotech can but it is far riskier.<br />Lynch never talks about debt.  The U.S. economy expanded in the 80's due to 1) heavy government spending, which created a huge national debt (2) consumer spending a ton of money and going into debt and (3) the entrepreneurial spirit.  The government actually funded a lot of the developments we see today.  The problem with this is that they have mortgaged the future to pay for past wealth creation.  He never once mentions the impact of debt.  It is great while you are charging the credit card up and enjoying the ride but eventually you have to pay the bills!<br />Lynch spends a lot of time telling the reader how he went about picking stocks for his Magellan Fund, but he has the ability to talk to CEO's and visit companies on site headquarters, something the average investor certainly does not have.  I would say though that Reg FD has made the playing field more even, as now nobody gets a lot of information!<br />My thoughts on stock picking, having worked in the financial service industry for 3 years in research (got out because my values didn't correlate with the business) is that no one should expect to beat the pros unless they are 1) very observant and 2) willing to commit time to finding new investment concepts/vehicles.ds a lot of time telling the reader how he went about picking stocks for his Magellan Fund, but he has the ability to talk to CEO's and visit companies on site headquarters, something the average investor certainly does not have.

This book, along with Seth Godin's Permission Marketing are quite similar and both are very easy to read.  If you want to learn more about internet marketing I would highly encourage you to read Seth Godin's book Unleashing the IdeaVirus, which deals with viral marketing in businesses and might help create additional marketing opportunities from the e-mail marketing campaigns you learn to set up with Ms. MacPherson's book.<br />The book is packed with great tips and advice for those of us just starting down the path of permission email marketing. The case histories of good and bad practices alike provide strong insights on communications and etiquette.  Most importantly, this book explains the terms of email marketing and, for someone more experienced, it helps you calculate costs and your ROI (return on investment) from the campaign.<br />All and all I would highly recommend this book as it is a practical guide for professional marketers and aspiring Internet Entrepreneurs.  I've seen a lot of email marketing books, and this is the best how-to book. If you combined this book with the underpinnings you can get from reading Seth Godin's Permission Marketing you will have the subject matter down cold.	2002-02-28

If you want to learn how to apply \\"buzz\\" to your business I would recommend \\"Unleashing the Ideavirus\\" by Seth Godin as a better starting place.  \\"Anatomy of a Buzz\\" by Emanual Rosen is another book on word of mouth social behavior but I have not read it, and as a result, I can't say if it is better or worse than this book.<br />I personally enjoyed this book because Mr. Gladwell puts a great spin around it with lots of concrete examples.  I personally enjoyed Unleashing the Ideavirus more, because Mr. Godin's writing style is VERY easy to read and his sole focus is business related, especially showing how online businesses can grow leaps and bounds with word of mouth marketing.<br />This book is about the sociological behavior of \\"buzz\\" and word of mouth advertising that causes products, locations and services to become hot commodities.  On the flip side Mr. Gladwell also describes how making the NY subways clean made people feel safe and caused criminal behavior to go down when the actual police budget only increased slightly.  The overall principle exposed in the book is applicable to a lot of situations and I found that reading this book caused a little lightbulb to go off in my head several times, which is why I rated the book 4 stars.  It would have been five stars but it isn't that well written, which makes the book drag on at times.  Although the story flow could be sometime more structured, the style is great and makes it very easy to read and very clear.<br />Hope this helps.  If anyone wants to find out some great books on business management e-mail me or look in my reviews.  Peter Drucker's The Essential Drucker and Built on Trust are the two books I would start with if you want to learn about business/management better. If you are solely interested in marketing you may want to read Robert Cialdini - Influence: The Science of Persuasion (a classic); Seth Godin - The Idea Virus; Elaine Hatfield - Emotional Contagion &amp; Richard Koch's - The 80/20 Principle<br />Examples of social \\"buzz\\" provided in this book include the resurgence of Hush Puppies, the rise of Airwalk, New York City's crime rate, Sesame Street, Blue's Clues and the rise of teen smoking.tagion &amp; Richard Koch's - The 80/20 Principle<br />Examples of social \\"buzz\\" provided in this book include the resurgence of Hush Puppies, the rise of Airwalk, New York City's crime rate, Sesame Street, Blue's Clues and the rise of teen smoking.	2002-02-28

More importantly, there will eventually be a derivatives disaster outside of the Long-term Capital one that occurred a couple of years ago.<br />This book, as I read it, is highly sensationalist.  I have worked in the financial service industry with institutions and chose to leave the industry about a year ago.  Here are my thoughts on this book as it relates to the derivatives markets.<br />1. Mr. Partnoy gives a high level description of some of the transactions that he was involved in<br />2. He seems to be indicting the market in derivatives, which I disagree on since he is dealing with institutions, which already should have a fiduciary responsibility to their clients.  If they are dumb and allow an investment bank to \\"rips their face off\\" as Partnoy claims then they shouldn't be 1) in those financial products or (2) doing business with them.  It is their choice!<br />3. From the reading it seemed as though Partnoy doesn't understand his role in the machine known as Wall Street.  He is a salesmen, pure and simple.  He gets paid to ring the register, nothing more.  Other people construct the deals and he is the marketer to clients.  If he makes clients money they should come back more and more.  Often times, there are MANY other factors that cause business to vary from firm to firm.  LOTS of different agendas/goals in mind.<br />4. Some of his anecdotes, particularly those in which he discusses the atmosphere in an investment bank around bonus time (pg.40 - 42, 202 - 205), are pretty amusing and dead on accurate.<br />5. The author's descriptions of some of his deals are clearly told from a junior banker's perspective, but they do a good job of putting forth what was being done, how it was being done, what everyone's perceived incentives for the transaction were, the work required to get the deal done, what kind of money, and importantly what kind of fees were involved.<br />In conclusion, like all books written by former investment bankers the book contains liberally sprinkled anecdotes regarding job interviews from hell, the ridiculous daily escapades that can occur on a trading floor, strip clubs, the lack of personal lives, gambling trips and other stories which could easily have been pulled from the pages of Mr. Lewis's book or \\"Monkey Business\\" by Rolfe and Troob. Folks, not all folks on Wall Street are like that but a HUGE percentage are.  Nothing wrong with that lifestyle but it is a choice everyone is free to make.  Hope this helps everyone.ad on accurate. <br />5.

Like another reader said, read Ray Kurzweils &quot;Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; after you read Microcosm to get better insight into semiconductors.  This book, along with Microchip Fabrication: A Practical Guide to Semiconductor Processing, are what enabled me to understand the forces driving the semiconductor / computer industry.  I was introduced to both books working as a junior semiconductor analyst coming out of grad school.  Gilder's book on Telecosm is great for those looking to better understand how telecommunications will affect the world's economies moving forward.<br />First off, don't read this book hoping to get investment advice.  That isn't Gilder's expertise.  The guy is an economist folks.  His rise to fame may have been during the telecom boom but he became well known during the Reagan era when he wrote a book on The Spirit of Enterprise and Wealth and Poverty, which discussed entrpreneurial ventures and how they were the key to creating wealth in this country.  Reagan dragged this guy around the country folks because of his insights into the entrepreneurial spirit!  Gilder sits on panels at conferences with such luminaries as Peter Drucker, Lester Thurow, Andy Grove and other intellectuals.<br />When you read this you will find out the following<br />1) There is a lot of technical jargon in it.  Most should be able to learn what he is saying but it isn't like reading a trashy, romance novel.  You have to think.<br />2) He is trying to convey the fundamental change that semiconductors will have on the economy and why.  Having worked in telecom and being a closet economist with an MBA I can say this guy knows his stuff folks.<br />3) Semiconductors are the core technology in any electronic equipment and it is actually the most proprietary element in a design so it is worth learning more about them since they create a lot of wealth for investors.<br />The one thing that Gilder emphasizes in this book is the power of individual initiative.  We are in the knowledge economy folks and microprocessors and PCs are enabling us to be more productive, begin new careers and experience a quality of life that very few predicted 40 years ago.  The microchip and its implications are amazing.  The power of the individual in the knowledge economy are causing governments to feel more helpless as they attempt to develop industrial policies and taxation.<br />Other books to read for futurists and aspiring managers/leaders are Peter Drucker's The Essential Drucker, Built on Trust (social organization) and The Worldly Philsophers by Robert Heilbroner (greatest economist highlights).<br />Now, eight years past its initial release, many of his predictions have come true.  Some may find fault with his politics, but this book and its conclusions are a convincing argument of his reasoning.

The impacts will be felt starting this year when fiber in the metropolitan markets connects into businesses with Ethernet.  But, I don't want to digress too much.<br />3) Gilder uses excellent prose and superb metaphors and I believe it is critical that people understand that Gilder, nor I, know when this stuff will finally start to affect us.  Right now there is an all out depression going on in the capital markets for telecommunications.  This will affect the deployment and timing of some applications/technologies.<br />Gilder, through his prose and descriptions of technologies/service companies describes how increasing bandwidth supplies its own demand.  This is true folks.  As prices drop for bandwidth applications always pop up that gobble it up.  Here is the kicker and frankly, where Gilder falls short.  You get what you pay for!  Gilder talks about the endless limits of fiber backbones and the applications that will be created and could occur.  I completely agree but only corporations are willing to fork out the bucks to get the high bandwidth directly to their doorstep.  To get such high bandwidth to the consumer would result in digging up streets nationwide and costing close to a trillion dollars.<br />This book is great.  I have read this book and his other tech book, Microcosm (on semiconductors.)  If you want to learn about technology those are two good books to start with.

The real Machiavelli would definitely have approved of this book since he was a womanizer.  This isn't rocket science but there is absolutely no mention of the man actually trying to look attractive, fit, etc. In this regard I think the book is pathetic.  Your odds go up the better you look and the more confidence you have.  That is a fact and normally there is a pretty strong correlation.<br />My conclusion is that some of the stuff is pathetic (ie. Filler) whereas some of the comments / techniques / insights are right on.  If you are looking for some tips on picking up ladies have at it.  But even if you don't plan to try any, it's worth reading just for the laughs.<br />A lot of the book (1/4) is common sense and should have been known by most men by now.  The key is to actually have the guts to apply the stuff.  Whether you happen to be; a veteran, a wanna-be, or a gonna-be, this book definitely says something you need to hear!

After graduating with my MBA I worked for two different companies over a three year span and I found both organizations completely lacking basic managerial capabilities and functionality.  Being a young, ambitious guy I knew I was \\"wet behind the ears\\" but my managers were deplorable at best.  The result was a downward spiral in productivity and results at both companies.<br />The key principles of the book are closure, commitment, respect, responsibility, communication and speedy resolution.  I won't go into depth about the principles but most people don't understand, including myself before I read this, how each contributes to an organization's overall success and \\"social capital.\\"<br />What the authors are trying to do is get companies to apply their \\"Trust Model\\" and the result is, in their minds and mine, that an organization will end up with a competitive advantage over their competitor.<br />I found the book to be quite similar in many regards to Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs at times since one of the goals is to help employees in attaining \\"self actualization\\" where their aspirations and sense of contribution occur.<br />The models' goals, to list a few, include (1) increasing group intelligence through communication (2) increasing creativity (3) making people feel passionate about work (4) creating synergies and (5) getting everyone focused on a common goal.<br />SENIOR MANAGERS OR ASPIRING MANAGERS!

This book is primarily focused on investors that became household names in the 1980s such as: Jim Rogers, Michael Steinhardt, Philip Caret, George Soros, George Michaelis, John Neff, Ralph Wanger, and Peter Lynch.<br />The prior book, The Money Masters, deals with Golden Age investors who, for the most part, attained their reputations prior to the crash of 1973 and 1974.<br />Both of Train's books are in the form of interviews he has with them.  Train's writing is crisp and entertaining, and his interviews uncover many pearls of wisdom applicable to any investor's philosophy.<br />The biggest brand name interviewed here, for most, is Peter Lynch who ran Fidelity's flagship Magellan fund.  Lynch pioneered a consumer approach to the investing process and invested using a hybrid of the growth and value style that has come to be known within the industry as GARP, standing for Growth At A Reasonable Price. Both Soros and Rogers have fairly interesting ideas about the nature of investing and the sentiment behind it.  Both of them worked at Soros' Quantum Fund, which was the largest and most successful hedge fund for decades and left both of them extremely rich.<br />If anyone is interested in books on the people behind the financial industry read Money Masters, New Money Masters, Predators Ball, Money Culture, Den of Theives and F.I.A.S.C.O.  25 Investment Classics and Goldman Sachs: the Culture of Success are other notable books.

The sections on Ben Graham and Sir John Templeton both outline the development of the fundamental approach to valuation as well as its original application in stock markets throughout the world. Phil Fisher and T. Rowe Price represent the two most celebrated proponents of what has come to be known as the growth strategy, adding the additional rigor of another layer of criteria to the value-style approach. Warren Buffett stands as one of the first great synthesizers of the ideas of both Graham and Fisher, while other investors like Larry Tisch represent variations on one particular strand, in Tisch's case that being value-investing.<br />If anyone is interested in books on the people behind the financial industry read Money Masters, New Money Masters, Predators Ball, Money Culture, Den of Theives and F.I.A.S.C.O.  25 Investment Classics and Goldman Sachs: the Culture of Success are other notable books.

THIS BOOK IS THE MGMT BOOK!	BUY THE BOOK!  Don't read any more reviews, just buy it!  More importantly, READ IT, front to back and absorb the material.  You'll be on your way to a different understanding of business principles.<br />Peter Drucker, the author of the book, is a distinguished professor and has the University of Claremont's business school NAMED after him.  He has continuously identified critical principles in management, economics, politics, and the world in general.  If most workers and managers read his teachings and practiced them people would have a much better grasp of the business world.<br />The \\"Essential Drucker\\" is the best business book I have come across on the philosophy of management.  He truly understands business and what makes a corporation effective, the managers.  Jack Welch has praised Drucker as one of the best writers of management he has come across.  I enjoyed some Drucker articles in business school and read his most recent book Management Challenges for the 21st century prior to picking this book up.  If you are looking for another simple and very effective business book try What the CEO Wants You to Know by Ram Charan, a Stanford professor. That book is only 150 pages and very simple to read/understand but the basics are what 9 out of 10 managers fail to execute.<br />This book is very interesting because it covers such a wide array of topics with over 60 years worth of writings by Mr. Drucker.  The book is segmented into 3 sections, the individual, management and society.  I am thoroughly glad that Mr. Drucker continually focuses on how corporations and managers affect society and how society affect the decisions that managers will need to make as you rarely will find that in a business book.<br />Drucker understands business better than 99.999% of the folks out there.

I flipped through it and found some humorous and insightful comments and decided to buy it to lighten up my reading, as I primarily read Peter Drucker, other management books and some philosophy.  I thought the book would be some light-hearted humor and I wasn't disappointed!<br />The author, Gretchen Craft Rubin, is an extremely witty woman. While her background is law the book has tons of comments from famous historical figures such as Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Plutarch, Shakespeare, and Edith Wharton.<br />The book is segmented, as expected, into the 4 sections described in the title (POWER MONEY FAME SEX).<br />Each section provides some unique insight into human behavior, some examples in recent history and tons of witty comments from historical figures<br />Here are just some of the examples but, just so you know, the book is not in quotation form.<br />\\"People believe, and research proves, that high-status men attract more women easily than low-status men.\\"<br />\\"The sex that accompanies your success is a nice perk for all your hard work - a pleasant, convenient way to demonstrate the status you've achieved.\\"<br />\\"They envy the pleasures they imagine you've won.  Perception drives reality, and your status swells accordingly. \\"<br />Playboy Donald Trump \\"When we walk into a restaurant, I watch grown men weep.\\" He was watching other men's reaction to his date, not his date herself.<br />Jack Kennedy reported \\"once I get a woman, I'm not interested in carrying on, for the most part.\\"  He was pursuing conquests, not relationships.<br />LBJ \\"Goddamn it, I had more women by accident than he ever had by design.\\" - he maintained a nookie room\\" in the capital for his illicit liaisons<br />\\"The more money, fame and power you have the more easily you can have casual sex.\\"<br />Anyways, I can go on and on about the book but I will not.  BUY THE BOOK, enjoy it as it is fairly easy reading and, at 270 pages well worth the price of the insights and humor delivered.at 270 pages well worth the price of the insights and humor delivered.	2002-02-13

Books	5	16	17	N	N	Left winged or right winged this book is well researched	America, Who Stole the Dream, was a WONDERFUL READ. I find myself leaning more to the right, from a political perspective, but the authors arguments are EXCELLENT at times and they definitely bring up some great points.<br />This book is the most well argued book I have read about the current demise of the middle class in the U.S. After reading it I would definitely have to say that I have more concern about political decisions being made in Washington as the authors illustrate that consistently the politicians don't do the right thing for the country.<br />The authors bring up several concerns<br />1. Middle class demise via outsourcing of manufacturing to lower cost areas<br />2. Growing disparity of wealth (the rich own more in % terms)<br />3. The outsourcing of the 'HIGH TECH JOBS' that are to be the savior of the country.<br />4. Commentary about various social programs set up and how ineffective they are.<br />In conclusion I would say this book was extremely well researched and I therefore give KUDOS to the authors. While I don't agree with everything they wrote I believe they have put forth an excellent piece of work.<br />My main contention with the book is that it focuses on the demise of manufacturing and low-end jobs, along with some high tech. The U.S. is expensive from a labor perspective. As we have outsourced much of our manufacturing we have been able to purchase products at cheaper prices in the U.S.. Imagine what some products would cost if we were paying for labor that was, in some cases, 10x higher than current wages in developing countries? NOWHERE in the book do the authors mention the BENEFIT to our standard of living because we can buy more with our dollars than we would be able to do so otherwise. In general, this book is WAY to the left so reader beware.<br />My background is a B.S. in Acct., an MBA in finance and current interests in economic and social policy development so I found this to be quite an interesting read.	2002-02-06

This book is a great introduction to the subject of Intelligence and psychometrics!  I just completed the book in two days and must say it was very insightful and straight to the point.  It wasn't the easiest reading but far more straightforward than most psychology/sociology stuff I have come across.  I knew very little about psychometrics before reading this book as I majored in accounting and got my MBA, with an emphasis in finance.  Plus I have some engineering.  I say this to put it into perspective as psychology, sociology, philosophy haven't been easy for me to comprehend in the past as they have been too verbose for me and boring, as it is out of my primary field of interest.  But, I was very happy to read this book and learned a lot in a short matter of time.  Additionally, if you want to learn more the author points to additional books/articles on each topic discussed.  This book is great for the following reasons:<br />1) It is easy to read as it is written to the non psychiatrist.<br />2) It has a section explaining the only technical stuff used, which is statistics (used in studies outside of psychology too.)<br />3) It provides a synopsis of the top issues, studies, articles and conclusions written about intelligence.<br />In my opinion, the author of this book is very fair and reasonable as he consistently stated both sides of an argument if there was one to an issue.  He did provide his insights only after stating what the majority of his fellow associates had concluded as well as if the debate was largely over or not within each issue.<br />So what was talked about in this tiny book of 125 pages?<br />1) Is there a general factor in intelligence?<br />2) Are there multiple types of intelligence, as Howard Gardner thinks?<br />3) Are people getting smarter?<br />4) How does race, age or the environment you are raised in affect intelligence?<br />5) What is the 'Flynn effect'?<br />6) How do our brains work?<br />Basically, Deary convinced me that there is a general factor that accounts for one's mental abilities but, as he states, there is still much research to be done as to how the brain operates so that improvements can occur in testing/research and cures for horrible diseases, such as Alzheimers, can be figured out.neral factor that accounts for one's mental abilities but, as he states, there is still much research to be done as to how the brain operates so that improvements can occur in testing/research and cures for horrible diseases, such as Alzheimers, can be figured out.	2002-02-05

At the end of the day, what did I get out of it?  Not much was my conclusion.....<br />The book, as someone else mentioned goes something like this......<br />* The market goes up. Jim Cramer rants. Maria Bartiromo pouts<br />* The market goes down. Jim Cramer rants. Maria Bartiromo pouts<br />Repeat - over and over again<br />Remember, these folks in the media are talking heads.  If the market is going up or down they don't care as they just report what is going on.  They are in the business of generating ratings, which pays the bills for the large corporations that own them.  They try to deliver breaking news and many do but, at the end of the day they are journalists.  It does talk about some of the history behind the financial news industry but, in general, I didn't really learn a lot that I find of value or humorous nature.<br />I love CNBC......I love REALMONEY.com but this book was lackluster.  Most folks don't want to write negative reviews but I won't hesitate to do so when I come across something that people should avoid.  It is well written, has a very nice front cover design but, at the end of the day, it is basically the life of Jim Cramer, CNBC folks and other related parties.  Modern day hoopla......Its got buzz appeal and that is about it.<br />If you want to learn something about the characters on Wall Street/society read some stuff by Michael Lewis such as Money Culture of Liars Poker.  Or you could read about how great companies are built and run by Jim Collins in his classic Built to Last and new book Good to Great.  If you are going to spend the time reading a book get something out of it of some value.  This is just drivel.	2002-01-29

I began reading this book hoping to find some answers to some of my thoughts on the changing economy and the first article by Mr. Drucker blew my mind away.  I LOVED IT.<br />The book is separated into different sections:<br />1. The Changing Economic Landscape<br />2. Knowledge as the Economic Force of Growth and Change<br />3. Measuring and Managing the Intangibles of Knowledge<br />4. Learning Organizations in the Global Knowledge-Based<br />  Economy<br />5. Society and Public Policy: Government, Education, and<br />  Training in the Knowledge-Based Economy<br />Some authors included Robert Reich, Peter Drucker and Lester Thurow.  I found another article by Stan Davis and Jim Botkin to be very interesting also.<br />I found that the first article in each section tended to be the most interesting within each section.  I don't know if it was intentionally designed this way or not but, at the end of the day, I found at least 3 articles in this book or about 90-100 pages total that completely stimulated my mind.<br />I believe every educated person should take an economics course, more specifically one that teaches them the importance of their career path on the impact to the society in which they live in.  We are moving into a world where economic distribution is becoming more skewed towards the knowledge worker and one where societies based on knowledge will increasingly generate greater wealth than other countries.<br />We are moving into a world where wealth creation is biased towards the creation of knowledge and how that knowledge is manipulated to create additional knowledge.  Nations that continue to dominate their economic agenda based on natural resources and industrialization may do decent but they will continually fall behind the fastest growing countries.  Why is it that the CRB has DECLINED over the past 20 years and not risen?  After all, is demand for such products not greater than ever?  Why is it then that such countries aren't the economic powerhouses?  If you seek answers to such questions this should be an interesting read for you.  Don't expect every article to excite you...But what few nuggets you find will truly enrich your knowledge.such products not greater than ever?

I've read parts of Communist Manifesto and Capital by Karl Marx and some Joseph Schumpeter.  I loved it all (especially Smith and Schumpeter) but it was BRUTAL as the dialects in those days varied so much from today's.<br />If you are new to economics or want summaries/insights into the greatest economists in history this book is for you.  Mr. Heilbroner's book, the Worldly Philosophers, is the best books on economics I have come across and I have endured graduate level economic courses, both macro and micro (along with the undergraduate courses.)  This book provides readers with a nice summary and analysis of the great Economic thinkers from Adam Smith, Karl Marx, David Ricardo, Mill, Keynes, Schumpeter and others.  I found the book to be very general and not extremely analytical/scholarly if you will.<br />The summaries of each man's economic concepts and life/times in which he lived were extremely accurate.  Additionally, I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the author tries to explain the multi-disciplined nature of economics and how it is a combination of sociology, history, political science and philosophy all rapped into one.  If you look at the London School of Economics graduate program you will find over 30 unique Masters Programs in economics as the field is increasingly becoming applied and specialized into different parts of the society.  Mr. Heilbroner asks a question at the end such as \\"are we seeing the end of Worldly Philosophers?\\" as the field is increasingly getting more specialized and very few economists are tackling the \\"big picture\\" anymore and how the various components of an economy (land, labor and capital) are intertwined with each other.  Definitely something to think about.....<br />I found myself sitting down and reading a chapter at a time, 50-60 pages, with no problems at all.  Mr. Heilbroner doesn't give you everything but perhaps enough to chomp your teeth into the works of each philosopher on your own.  At the end of the book he has a list of suggested readings for those seeking more information on any of the economists/subjects mentioned but, frankly, I don't think many can handle 99% of the stuff.o chomp your teeth into the works of each philosopher on your own.

Mr. Maslow's work was about his desire to better understand what truly makes humans strive to reach their potential.<br />Mr. Maslow wasn't a business specialist; he was a psychologist and revolutionized behavioral sciences with seminal work on the \\"hierarchy of needs.\\"  Mr. Maslow's work began being preached to business students in the early 1960's through Douglas McGregor's work.<br />This book is a collection of published and unpublished articles and thoughts by Mr. Maslow, edited by Deborah Stevens.<br />This book provides insights from Maslow on fostering entrepreneurship, enhancing creativity in the workplace and maximizing the organizational effectiveness of individual workers through self-actualized work.<br />If you are looking for a good business book GO ELSEWHERE but if you want to learn about the hierarchy of needs or Abraham Maslow this book may be the book for you.<br />As a general rating I give the book 3 stars.  Why?  Because, outside of the basic framework on the hierarchy of needs and the evolution of man within it I found the book boring and I consistently found myself searching for groundbreaking or extremely applicable comments in various sections to the realm of business.  Yes, business is about creativity and innovation (even more so in today's information age) but other books provide more insight into those areas.  Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen is such a book.<br />Don't get me wrong, if you have never read Maslow you need to as it is REQUIRED READING at all the top MBA programs and truly is essential in understanding business and managing a business.  Business is about people and understanding what makes them tick.  However, as it pertains to reading material I found myself searching for great commentary and not getting much.  I like to read a book and find myself completely absorbed by it reading 50-60 pages at a time (with this book I could never do it and I love reading heady stuff.)  I read primarily business books, even some economic philosophy stuff, which is deep stuff, but it was far more thought provoking than this book.ike to read a book and find myself completely absorbed by it reading 50-60 pages at a time (with this book I could never do it and I love reading heady stuff.)

Of those that do (or are forced to go to seminars) 90% of people don't apply what they are taught or read so the failure rate of these books/seminars is around 99% because people don't have the internal drive to seek and learn new tools and THEN IMPLEMENT THEM to move their sales career forward.<br />I found this book enjoyable but not as good/entertaining as other books I have read about sales/customer relationship.  How to be a Rainmaker, by Jeffrey Fox and the Little Book on successful selling by Brian Tracy are two sales-related books that I got more out of and thought were easier to read.<br />This book does have its good points though.<br />1) I thought Chapter 3 on customer feedback was very well done as most sales people and their companies don't focus enough on this element.<br />2) Chapter 4 was about customers telling people how to sell and<br />3) Chapter 5 was some good questions to ask yourself as far as customer service goes.<br />They key to getting long-term value out of a book like this is to practice what you read essentially.  The book is only 120 pages long and is very easy to read.  Whether you are in sales or not you are selling everyday.  You sell yourself to your family, friends, co-workers, etc.  You are creating an image in that person's mind of what they associate you with (pain or pleasure).	2002-01-27

The book has a quote, a story and then a brief evaluation of what he is trying to convey to the reader. I believe Maxwell's interpretations are right on the money and a very refreshing way of looking at teamwork, a skill that is essential in today's economy and future economy, which promises to be more based on social skills and business networks.<br />Mr. Maxwell uses 17 qualities to describe a successful team player: Adaptable, Collaborative, committed, communicative, competent, dependable, disciplined, enlarging, enthusiastic, intentional, mission conscious, prepared, relational, self-improving, selfless, solution oriented, tenacious.<br />I believe the key ingredient in getting long-term value out of this book is to highlight the quotes/stories you love and integrate them into your daily life. Practice what you read if it ties in with your VALUES.  I believe that the values / qualities expressed in this book provide a practical guide to achieving personal fulfillment in your career, marriage and social relations.<br />I gave the book a 4 star rating because the website, which has assessment tests, is not up and running until February yet I was able to buy and read the book well before such date.  If a publisher/author is going to incorporate such tools/add-ons into a book they should make sure they are operational and running 100% effectively by the time the book is published.  To me, that is business 101.  Perhaps Maxwell should learn something about that!  After all, commitment and vision were two of the qualities he espoused in his 21 qualities of a leader book.

A Beginners's Guide to the World Economy is a good introduction into financial and economic terms. The book is segmented into 81 basic economic concepts, which the authors state, \\"will change the way you see the world.\\" I believe their phrase is definitely hyperbole because I didn't find any \\"earth shattering\\" commentary.<br />The book is a compilation of information/tidbits you would learn in economics, finance and international finance/business classes. The concepts, in many cases, are common sense and the average person, who has no formal education in the subject, probably would know 10-15 of them minimum.<br />If you don't know anything about finance or economics it might be worth a good read over 7-8 nights, covering 10-15 subjects a night. The book is easy reading but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a business or finance degree wanting to see if this is a \\"refresher\\" book because it is very light but a great introduction to economics/finance for those with liberal arts backgrounds. If any liberal arts folks seek a bible of finance it is called \\"Valuation\\" and is a mckinsey book. It is used in just about every top MBA program.

I gave this book 4 stars because, while it was refreshing to read and I definitely learned quite a bit, it wasn't a paradigm-shifting book, which is what I am increasingly moving towards for my 5 star books.<br />I warn folks that don't like buzzwords that this book has TONS of them. Frankly, there were more than I care for and I normally don't mind them!<br />Mr. Godin consistently picks a topic of business conversation/interest and then provides readers with his insights. In Permission Marketing he spoke about the rampant increase in e-mail marketing campaigns and what made them effective vs. ineffective and the impact it would have on consumer/business relations. In Unleashing the Ideavirus Mr. Godin spoke about the power of word of mouth advertising and how companies could utilize the Internet as an enabling device to cost effectively communicate with customers and generate excitement in a product/service.<br />Survival is Not Enough, by Seth Godin, is another bestseller in the works. For some reason Mr. Godin seems to get the \\"big picture\\" better than most. More importantly, the manner in which he conveys the information / subject manner is normally easier to understand than other books on comparable subject matter. With his new book Mr. Godin tackles the subject of rapid change and its impact on business. Using the metaphor of Darwin's Law of Evolution Mr. Godin compares a corporation's evolution to any animal.<br />The entire book can be summed up in a very simple manner. Evolve (change) or die. The fittest company will win at the end of the day such as the fiercest Lion will end up passing on his genes to other lions.<br />Rather than spell out each chapter I would say that Mr. Godin hits on several key things within the book that really make it worth reading<br />1) Why it is better to make small changes than big changes to survive (EVOLVE vs. massive restructuring).<br />2) How can a company accelerate changes so it doesn't become static and die?<br />3) Why you need to make sure you have the right people on board.<br />4) How do people deal with fear and change? What are some of the artificial barriers we as humans put up to avoid change? I found some of the insights to be interesting.<br />5) Are all companies capable of change? Obviously a lot don't (they become extinct via bankruptcy) but did they miss along the way which hurt the company (examples are provided.)<br />Mr. Godin's last chapter gives a long list of important questions that deal with change. Through asking them and honestly answering them you may find some insightful things about your companies' culture and the implications for your career development, as well as their future success. In general I found the book to be very insightful but much tougher than his previous books to read.

The common thread amongst the jobs she takes it that they were all physically demanding jobs that were mind numbing and typically earned under $10 an hour. She has startup money (first and last months' rent) and a car to use and very quickly discovers that life's basic needs can barely be met on minimum wage. She specifically addresses issues of affordable housing (not plentiful), food (she can't eat healthy or often) and medical insurance or the lack thereof offered in such positions.<br />Ms. Ehrenreich's quickly finds that it is almost a necessity to work two jobs to support herself living alone if she earns under $10 an hour, something that didn't surprise me at all. She definitely sheds some light on the working poor, specifically single mothers re-entering the workforce.<br />My conclusion: I learned a lot and definitely sympathize for working mothers but she never addresses key social and personal issues such as (1) drug use - SHE USES DRUGS - drugs will hold you back in our society (2) Education - if you don't have one you are forced into poverty so graduate from high school, get a loan and go to college and (3) Past mistakes affect a person's future.<br />The book was wonderful but I was driven nuts by the fact that none of these \\"characters\\" wanted to move ahead in life via an education. If you don't have a higher education in today's society you will frequently be forced into labor-oriented jobs where you are nothing more than a COG (cost of good) in the corporate machine. The education is used as a signaling effect to people/companies that \\"I want to get ahead in life,\\" not so much that people with a degree are naturally brighter than others. What about self respect? DREAMS? Working towards those dreams? Measuring progress?

In general I learned quite a bit from the book and found the sections on law development/social contracts and American property history to be a HUGE learning experience full of insight.  If you read this book you can truly learn a lot but you have to read it with an open mind.<br />At times Mr. De Soto is VERY REPETITIVE.  Chapters 1-4 keep on repeating his conclusion in different manners and I found that reading those chapters was like him trying to beat his conclusion into my head.<br />His conclusion:  Such countries have yet to establish and normalize the invisible network of laws that turns assets from &quot;dead&quot; into &quot;liquid&quot; capital, specifically as it pertains to property and ownership of land. In the West, standardized laws allow us to mortgage a house to raise money for a new venture, permit the worth of a company to be broken up into so many publicly tradable stocks, and make it possible to govern and appraise property with agreed-upon rules that hold across neighborhoods, towns, or regions.<br />Mr De Soto backs up his claims with some profound numbers too.  For example, in Egypt, the wealth the poor have accumulated via real estate/property is worth 55 times as much as the sum of all direct foreign investment ever recorded there.  He also provides data in the countries of Haiti and Peru.<br />Mr. De Soto provides insights as to how these countries are currently organized/operate via an &quot;extra legal&quot; sector.  Rather than operating under a formal code of law local cooperatives enforce and provide dispute resolution and he argues that, since law evolves out of social contract that property laws/organizations could be made a part of the law to help unleash capital through the economy.<br />If you want to read a good book on socio-economics I highly recommend the book.	2002-01-11

I've lost 50 pounds this year after getting sick and tired about my weight.  Make no mistake about it folks, this book or any other book/weight loss program won't help you long-term.  The long-term success rates dealing with the obese and their success at keeping off weight are in the vicinity of 2-3%.  This book gives you information, which is a tool for attaining success but until I got off my butt and exercised more and stopped eating the junk food all the time it wasn't going to go off.<br />This book will help you if you truly are \\"sick and tired\\" or being \\"sick and tired.\\"  What I loved about this book is its simplicity.  He knows how to lose weight and hits all the basic principles down cold.  If you follow what he recommends doing you will probably lose weight.<br />Here is the problem.  From my extensive reading in the past 2 years I have learned that most weight issues tend to deal with inner issues about pain/pleasure and self-motivation, not about lack of information.  The information is out there.  I personally like Bill Phillips' Body For Life book more than Mr. Karras book because it is easier to read and deals with more of the inner issues and motivational tools that people can use to succeed. What I didn't like was Mr. Phillips pitching of his product throughout the book but his plan works phenomenally.  Additionally, Mr. Phillips lifts weights and practices what he preaches.  While Mr. Karras certainly looks like a healthy guy do I want to look like him or Mr. Phillips?<br />There is no magic pill, no secret food, no magical combination of foods that causes you to burn fat immediately.  It's just calories in vs. calories out. More importantly, it is a lifestyle, not a diet.

I read a lot of business books and I have to say that Drucker really gets the \\"big picture\\" better than 99.999% of the people out there.  If you want some other good books related to this book try Free Agent Nation by Daniel Pink and As the Future Catches You by Juan Enriquez (two chapters succinctly FULLY explain the value of the knowledge worker in the 21st Century. The rest of the book is extra info. on genomics but it is VERY EASY to read).  The nice part about Drucker's book is that he gives tips and suggestions, along with things to look for in the next generation of managing workers.  At times his language can be a bit more boring than the previous two titles I mention but the book is definitely worth reading.<br />Drucker wastes no time in this book by stating what he believes is the most powerful social force working today and some of the consequences that arise from it.<br />He believes the aging of the population in the developed countries will have profound impacts on future wealth creation and societal structures. This is a result of a lowering of the birthrate in these countries.  When you then add the fact that an additional 2 billion people are projected to live on this planet in the next 20 years you begin to really think about the profound potential impact to the planet and business.<br />Drucker states that &quot;the most important, and indeed the truly unique, contribution of management in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the productivity of the 'manual worker' in manufacturing. The most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century is similarly to increase the productivity of 'knowledge work' and the 'knowledge worker.' The most valuable assets of a 20th-century company were its production equipment. The most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution, whether business or nonbusiness, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity.&quot;<br />That comment alone illustrates that Drucker fully understands the implications that arise from countries evolving their economies from agricultural to industrial to service and technology based knowledge economies.  I gave it 4 stars because at times it is pretty tedious reading but definitely a very good book.stands the implications that arise from countries evolving their economies from agricultural to industrial to service and technology based knowledge economies.

Peter Drucker's Management Challenges for the 21st Century and Daniel Pink's Free Agent Nation are two other good reads on a knowledge-based economy.<br />While Mr. Enriquez spends most of the book talking about genomics (his area of expertise and knowledge) and the implications arising from developments in the area, he also tries to illustrate the impact such discoveries might have on the world economy in a very basic, easy-to-understand manner.  Mr. Enriquez does an excellent job in talking about the importance of education and how the large differences among certain geographic regions may lead to a larger divergence of wealth in the next century.<br />In talking about genomics, Mr. Enriquez is quick to talk about cloning and the moral and ethical issues that will arise from such technology and how it will be EXTREMELY TOUGH to policy this technology due to its rapid evolution and ability to move into other countries borders.  In the past the evolution of public policy was adjusted with the technologies but genomics is different in that we are talking about the potential to create human life via cloning, which stirs up all kinds of moral and social issues which affects politicians and their voting constituencies.<br />The one thing I know is that genomics is revolutionizing modern medicine as we breathe today.  The new drugs, cures and foods that will be created and these WILL have VERY PROFOUND impacts on our standard of living in the next century and will cause tons of social implications.  This book is your entrance into learning about geonomics in a very easy to read book.  I highly recommend purchase of the book.	2001-12-12

This book does an excellent job in showing how the U.S. employment market is truly changing in modern times.  Instead of being captives of the corporation income-earners are now free agents, including some 30 million freelancers, temps, and microbusiness owners. The lifestyles and philosophies of this growing group will impact the labor pool, retirement, education, real estate, and politics.<br />While Daniel Pink terms the phrase \\"Free Agent Nation\\" to describe the current economy he basically hits on the fact that the U.S. economy is a more knowledge-based, service-oriented economy without using all the economic jargon.  While Pink doesn't focus on the evolution of the U.S. economy (agricultural to industrial to service &amp; technology) he focuses heavily on \\"big picture\\" issues that will arise from such an economy.  While I wish he explained to everyone the increase in our societies wealth and standard of living from such an evolution he doesn't.  But it helps the flow and makes it a lot easier and fun to read, that is for sure!<br />Pink does an excellent job in assessing why our economy is evolving.  Free Agency is a post-industrial phenomenon that thrives in areas where innovation and flexibility are the only means of survival.  Pink concludes that our current evolution is a function partially of what William Whyte wrote in \\"The Organization Man\\" in 1956.  Today's worker, if properly educated and full networked has the ability to specialize and participate in the U.S. economy in a radically different way than in the past.<br />If you are considering working for yourself, especially if you are a college-educated individual who considers the corporate route the only way to go, I would highly encourage you to read this book.  Other books of interest about \\"big picture\\" workplace issues are Peter Drucker's Management Challenges for the 21st Century and As the Future Catches You by Juan Enriquez, which does an excellent job (in a very brief chapter or two of the book) to show why rich nations are pulling further and further ahead of other countries and what it means in the long-term to the training of a countries workforce.e book) to show why rich nations are pulling further and further ahead of other countries and what it means in the long-term to the training of a countries workforce.	2001-12-12

Excellent for managers and start-ups	Jim Collins, co-author of Built To Last, has done it again!  This time he spent 5 years trying to find out what differentiates good companies from great companies.  This study can be applied to entrepreneurial ventures and to current corporate America.  After reading this book you may see your company from a much different perspective than in the past and it may have you thinking about the effectiveness of senior managers within your company.  I believe it is a book that business executives will read and keep handy for reference.<br />This book is a study of companies that exceed their industry, the overall stock market and produce PHENOMENAL returns over a 15-year period (15 of them are very \\"normal\\" years and the next 15 years are full of explosive growth).  Some key points you will take away from this book include:<br />1) Growth in most companies came after years and years of trying to adapt / mold a concept into something the company truly believed in.  Once this happened the growth engine got going.<br />2) Great managers worry more about getting the right people on board and the wrong people off board BEFORE they establish a corporate stategy.<br />3) Most great CEOs came from within their own ranks and weren't recruited from the outside.<br />4) Executive compensation didn't appear to be a key driver of corporate performance<br />5) The respective great companies exceeded the overall stock market in creating shareholder value by at least 3x during their 15 year run measured (some for many more years).  While some may say this is not much think about the steel industry and how many are filing for bankruptcy.  Nucor Steel still managed to beat the S&amp;P by more than 3x.<br />6) The great companies in this book blew away their comparable peer group.  Wells Fargo vs. Bank of America, Kroger vs. other grocery chains, Walgreens vs. Eckerd, etc.<br />7) Collins describes a Level 5 leader.  After reading this section I was amazed at how many CEOs I recognized as not being Level 5 leaders.  This may, in the near future, shake up executive compensation plans, CEO searches and potentially affect corporate governance.<br />8) Technology accelerated a transformation but was regarded as a tool.  It didn't define the company.<br />9) M&amp;A activity played virtually no role in going from good to great.<br />That is all I will write about the book.  I could write on and on about how good this book is.  Read it.  It will change the way you think about business.

I have also read Money Culture but this is the first book I have read from Lewis that is outside of the financial services industry.<br />In this book Lewis begins to look at some of the social implications of the Internet and some of the crazy stories that are occurring as a result of the Internet Phenomena.  Examples include:<br />·A 15 year old becomes the leading legal advisor on AskMe.Com.<br />·Another youth (15 also) draws SEC fire after earning $800K in security trades through various pump and dump schemes on message board.<br />·An older rock band (40+ years old) get their fans to pay for their overseas tour BEFORE the concert.

I found myself having a difficult time putting the book down at various times as the insight from this insider was unbelievable. Frankly I was behind the curve in the wireless sector as far as my history went but this book did an excellent job of getting me up to speed, describing what a wild ride is was in the sector and the book did an amazing job of telling the stories of some interesting characters involved in the wireless industry during its nascent stage.	2001-10-14

This book is not Maxwell's best book and I believe he quotes himself way too much (1/3 of the total quotes are his!). His best books on inspirational / motivational / leadership are Power of Leadership and Power of Attitude (2 separate books that are similar size books and quick reads.) If you are looking for a full-blown book try 2 of his other books, 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader or 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. While I know the book is supposed to be about THINKING BIG I found many quotes from other books. There are better books out there to spend your money on.<br />They key to getting any long-term value out of Maxwell's books is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life.

If you truly want to understand how e-commerce works and how to leverage your marketing efforts in the online world read about e-mail marketing, viral marketing and a little on web design and then learn about writing great sales copy (ogilvy is king here.) For e-mail marketing books check out Seth Godin and Permission marketing and E-mail marketing that works by Kim MacPherson I believe. Godin has another book about viral marketing and there are two additional books, The Anatomy of a Buzz and The Tipping Point that are also good reads.<br />The problem I have with the book is that it is nothing more than a sales pitch where the authors speak about how great their company is and all the features.  If you sign up you sell from affiliate stores, some of which are known, and from others that are no name stores.  The business model is quite similar to Amway.  So, if you want to do multilevel marketing this might be the book for you but if you are trying to understand why leading e-commerce companies work &amp; how they experience explosive growth the way they do I would try to learn about some of the concepts in the books/titles I mentioned, especially Seth Godin's books.  Then, maybe you could leverage those ideas in your own multilevel marketing efforts.	2001-10-14

If you are an investment professional who is well read, this book isn't for you.  In this book the author tries to briefly describe each book and the relevant points of each book, with some excerpts taken from each.<br />He is very negative on technical analysis (the author), as his tone and comments about this form of analysis is negative throughout the book.  I personally find this very distasteful as technical analysis would have bailed you out of the market at most of its peaks (when money flows turned negative - it did in telecom service in April 2000)<br />I do believe the wide array of books utilized is a very good collection for a beginner. Some other good books, which actually talk to individuals is Market Wizards : Interviews With Top Traders by Jack D. Schwager and John Train's Money Master and New Money Masters (2 different books).  I believe everyone should read Peter Lynch's first book, Beating the Street. A good book on managing your money is Suze Orman's 9 Steps to Financial Freedom<br />Having worked with portfolio managers as a research analyst I hope this helps everyone.	2001-10-14

I thoroughly enjoyed the book and I believe that, in a very simple manner, the authors lay out the evolution of technology giants within different sectors.  They help you identify the next \\"800 Lb. Gorilla,\\" which may generate substantial returns for investors.<br />If there is any weakness it is that very little is provided in terms of how do you value these companies.  Most past \\"gorillas\\" came public with very modest valuations but in today's markets many companies are coming out at higher valuations, providing less upside in the long-term.  The reason is that many investors are more astute than in the past and are seeking to find these \\"gorillas.\\"  Therefore, the problem that lies before the investor is how to find the gorilla before the pros do.  Too many pros and individuals tried to find them in the past 2 years and only got burned (they were all greedy going after the hopes of generating such returns and the possibility that one would be the \\"800 lb gorilla.\\")<br />If you want to learn about technology life cycles, product differentiation and what to look for in the next decade's giants I recommend this book but recognize that it provides little in terms of valuation exercises.	2001-10-14

Like other books on improving sales you need to APPLY these techniques and principles in order to get maximum value out of the book.  If anything, you will at least learn to recognize good sales people from bad ones.<br />This book is, for some, common sense.  For others, this book is a quick refresher course of the basic principals of selling and finally, it might be a completely new experience for many and it may have you thinking about the art of selling.  The reality is that the value of this book, to you, probably depends on how much training and common sense you already have.  In general, I really enjoyed the book and thought there were many interesting sales concepts, which I am looking forward to employing to see how effective they are in real life.

I have been reading about 2-3 books on leadership/marketing/business for the past 3 months as I have considered going the entrepreneurial route. If you are an entrepreneur or thinking about becoming one I highly recommend you read this book.  Why?<br />This book clearly illustrates to the entrepreneur the different skill sets he/she will have to adopt over the long-term if your company is on a high-growth trajectory.  Have you ever noticed that most CEOs aren't the person that founded the company?  I have seen many founders resign, step aside to bring in more seasoned managers, etc.  The United States is such a successful country because of our capital formation and entrepreneurial spirit.  Entrepreneurs create a huge number of jobs as capital and people are always seeking out companies they believe can change the way a certain business is done.<br />Lets say you have money, you have growth, and you have employees.  What do you do to manage these different constituencies and grow the company so you will still be around to see the company prosper?  This book clearly provides the roadmap (almost like a blueprint for the fast-growing CEO to adhere to.)	2001-10-14

After reading Chapter One I was very excited about this book, as it was basically a statistical analysis of what makes managers succeed and what is most important to employees. Maister crunches the #'s and provides case studies with interviews from top managers surveyed.<br />The book is essentially that great companies are a function of great managers, who know how to manage employees and offer them a fun, fast paced, creative environment. Maister's analysis backs this up with numbers! Any good manager will tell you that their people are their #1 asset, especially in a day and time when intellectual capital is the most valuable asset in our information economy. It is tough to retrain your workforce over and over and businesses lose momentum as a result.<br />At times the book can be boring. I was initially very bullish on the book because his analysis provides some quick lists for which you can try to improve upon but what I was not happy about was that he gives another list of 200 things that most successful managers must incorporate into their style to attain above average results. This would be very difficult because, and Maister admits this, most successful managers have these traits as values (they are part of their core attitude in life.) Unless you are great at retraining yourself it maybe difficult.	2001-10-14

This year alone, 2001, I have dropped 50 pounds, 47 pounds of which are fat.  I lost 25 pounds in 12 weeks while following Body for Life earlier this year.  I am currently doing another 12 weeks that will end before thanksgiving.<br />Body for Life, like any other fitness/health plan, will only allow you to get results based on your effort.  If you gorge yourself with food or dont exercise like he says, dont expect to get the kind of results that people in his book have gotten.<br />Body For Life, while it is somewhat a promotional vehicle for EAS Myoplex, is a very sound book on nutrition and exercise.  Most importantly, Mr. Phillips tries to get people to look within themselves and try to find out what they want out of a fitness program and goals in life.  It is definitely a combination of self-help book meets exercise.<br />Mr Phillips applies bodybuilding concepts (6 meals a day, weightlifting and cardio) and has tweaked them somewhat so that non-bodybuilders can get excellent results out of the program in a very short period of time.<br />Regarding nutrition - 6 meals a day - this is recommended to keep insulin levels more level throughout the day and to help shuttle nutrients to your cells. He also has a free day once a week where he tells people to eat whatever they want (pizza, cheeseburgers, whatever your weakness is J.)<br />His 20 minute cardio sessions, entitled HIIT (high intensity interval training), can really work a person hard and are great for those that have every excuse about not having enough time in the day!<br />His high point mentioned when lifting weights is what weightlifting is all about.  It is why bodybuilders get phenomenal results and the average guy (who works out daily) may look the same year after year.  Lifting weights is key to long-term metabolism - the avg. person loses 0.7 pounds of muscle after the age of 25, which contributes to why we gain weight.  We lose muscle naturally and continue to eat (normally more) while exercising less as we get used to our jobs!<br />Bottom Line:  If you are interested in your health you arent going to go wrong following the plan.  I have read the book 3 times now in the year I have owned the book and given it to a few friends that have asked me what I am doing to lose the weight.y more) while exercising less as we get used to our jobs!<br />Bottom Line:  If you are interested in your health you arent going to go wrong following the plan.

The reason I purchased it was to see what the results said. Here is a brief synopsis: You have to read the book or listen to the CD to get the full effect. The book on CD was a very easy listen and I found it very entertaining and enjoyable. This is just a small list.<br />·They are \\"Cheap dates,\\" and don't spend a lot of their money<br />·They are balance sheet affluent - I loved this part. Basically, it states that so many people look rich but have so much debt they aren't rich. They just want to look rich. Most of these folks own their homes outright, drive cars for extended periods and don't spend lavishly.<br />·Most didn't inherit their wealth<br />·Most got Bs and Cs in high school. Ie. They aren't braniacs - 2.92 GPA<br />·Most own their own business, low-tech businesses that will be around for a long time. Ie. Not much product development, etc. Stuff like gas stations<br />·SAT scores between 1100 and 1190<br />·37% are deeply religious people who attend church regularly<br />·92% are married<br />·They have been with their first wife for an average 28 years<br />·They avoid the lottery and gambling<br />·They like to spend time with family and friends<br />·Integrity in business is their # priority<br />One final note: each and ALL BUT ONE OF THE ABOVE is a description of my father to the nth degree.

First and foremost, let me say that I read a lot of business / strategy / leadership books.  John Maxwell's books, Power of Leadership and 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader are also good reads too. This book would normally get a 5 star rating because it has great bang for the buck.  A lot of great wisdom for little cost.  But, I am taking off a star because execution was mentioned towards the end.  In my opinion, investors pay for execution of a business model.  PERIOD.  If you don't execute on a proposed business plan you are dead.  You won't get to the top because the CEO knows that is what Wall Street and investors demand.<br />I believed that the author used great examples and quotes and is concise and straight to the point.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants an easy to read, compact book (good size) and large # of tips on how to get ahead in business, and in life.  I believe the key ingredient in getting long-term value out of this book is to highlight the quotes/stories you love and integrate them into your daily life.

This makes the basics of the book very simple to understand.  I was quite stunned to find the content extremely useful.  Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. This book is good for those that are looking for a quick read and who are either currently managing people or wanting to manage people.<br />Goal setting is all about making sure employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. The Praisings and Reprimands are simply managers acknowledging that the employees are doing there jobs or not and how to deal with the situation and how to convey it to the employee.<br />In my opinion the book is pretty good but I think everyone should read Leadership and the One Minute Manager rather than this book as Leadership is essential and it is what differentiates great companies from good ones.  The key, like most books that are self-help, is to apply these principles each and every day.  Catch yourself when you slip and find ways to incorporate them into your value system.	2001-10-04

Robert Allen's Multiple Streams of Internet Income is a pretty good read.  If there is any value here it is that he shows you what he did to generate money on the Internet and he takes people from beginning to end in what makes a website effective, how to generate different kinds of revenue and how to market the website.  <br />Like others, I must say that his comments about making $24,000 in 24 hours is quite misleading (I didn't think I could because I knew it was too good to be true.)  Those that thought they could must have been looking for the quick buck.  Mr. Allen had a long list of subscribers he had accrued, which he used to generate the revenue.  This is what permission based marketing is all about.  His example clearly illustrates the value of selling information-based products on the Internet.  I must confess though, he was hyping real estate when tax laws favored that and now he sees everyone running to the Internet so he writes about how to make money there.  It reminds me of that Don. C guy with his infomercials (LOL).  Kinda sleazy.......<br />Hoping to start my own Internet-based business within the next two years, I have gained significant insight through my readings.  I believe people should read about viral marketing and permission based marketing (examples are in the book).  The biggest problem with the Internet is that competition is HUGE!  It boils down to who can get to the customer first and then who can cost effectively generate a profit from these customers.  That means providing them value above and beyond what they perceive they are paying.  This book doesn't touch on the economics of that well enough.  That is why so many dot.com businesses are gone today.  They had no business sense at all.<br />Bottom Line:  I give it a 3 star rating for a pretty good effort but not the best book to read.  For those looking for good reads I suggest Seth Godin's Permission Based Marketing or Kim MacPherson's Permission-based E-mail Marketing That Works!  If you are looking for good viral marketing books Seth Godin's Unleashing the IdeaVirus, Emanual Rosen's Anatonomy of a Buzz and Malcom Gladwell's The Tipping Point are good reads on the subject in that order.	2001-10-04

He knows his stuff...	I bought this book this past summer to get some additional insights into new exercises but, more importantly, to understand the mindset of a champion.  If you read this entire behemoth of a book you will take away valuable insight that can also be applied to your life.<br />One example of this would be to train your weakest body part first.  While a very simple thought, you can tell from looking at people in the gym that most people don't use this at all.  I have seen way too many men with huge arms, chest and shoulders but pathetic backs and legs.  If you are into bodybuilding this is key.  You can apply this to your life by focusing on whatever your weakness is.  Do you have a temper, wake up late, or need to get an education to provide for your family?  While it does require looking at the book from a different framework it can help.<br />Arnold provides numerous exercises, talks about intensity and fatiguing the muscle and, of course, what kind of nutrition is required to grow.  He talks about cariod workouts, prepping for contests, posing etc.  This is like Bodybuilding 101 in a book.  If you aren't into bodybuilding but want to learn more about fitness just skip the contest part but this book is nothing short of awesome and well worth the price.  I have read the book once and gone back to different sections twice since I bought it this summer simply to try new stuff to fatigue my muscles in new ways.<br />If you are a beginner and don't know anything about weightlifting try Body for Life, as it deals with more of the emotional issues associated with weight and is very much a bodybuilders routine.  Just easier to follow and will help prep you for this bruiser of a book.	2001-10-04

I prefer this book to the One Minute Manger because it has the same basic concepts but deals with situational leadership, which is what most managers truly face.  There are three simple precepts, which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands (just as in the original One Minute Manager).<br />1. Starting with goals that are clear to both the manager and the people who will help accomplish them. Goal setting is all about making sure employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises.<br />2. The manager should work with his/her people to diagnose their &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;commitment&quot; to accomplish those goals.<br />3. Decide what management style is most appropriate for the individual<br />4. Following through and provide reprimands or praisings based on that adopted style.  The Praisings and Reprimands are simply managers acknowledging that the employees are doing there jobs or not and how to deal with the situation and how to convey it to the employee.<br />As always, I was quite stunned to find the content extremely useful and extremely simplistic.  For those seeking to find additional leadership books I recommend How to Become CEO by Jeffrey Fox and two books by John Maxwell, Power of Leadership and The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader.	2001-10-04

Having read several of Maxwell's books I think this is one of his better ones as the stories, quotes and examples can truly transform people.<br />The author uses twenty-one qualities for the basis of successful leadership: character, charisma, commitment, communication, competence, courage, discernment, focus, generosity, initiative, listening, passion, attitude, problem-solving, relationship, responsibility, security, self-discipline, servanthood, teachability and vision.<br />History has shown us that great companies (that create tons of shareholder wealth) / teams are created by great leaders.  I read this hoping to further develop my leadership skills.  I believe the key ingredient in getting long-term value out of this book is to highlight the quotes/stories you love and integrate them into your daily life. Practice what you read if it ties in with your VALUES. Like someone earlier stated I believe that the values / qualities expressed in this book provide a practical guide to achieving personal fulfillment in marriage, parenthood, and all other relationships outside of business.<br /><br />Hope this helps everyone.	2001-10-04

He talks about commodities and equities throughout the book and it is a very good evaluation of market trends.  There are tons of graphs to help the reader along.<br />I personally believe that technical analysis should be incorporated into just about any decision-making process when investing for any fund, stock and/or options.

If you are in the marketing field I believe Seth Godin is a guy who knows his stuff. He and Jay Abraham are gurus on the subject. His books are normally very timely and his more recent book, Unleasing the IdeaVirus (a book on viral marketing), builds upon what he writes in this book. I have also read Kim McPherson's Permission based E-mail marketing that Works! While both are excellent books about the subject I believe Mr. Godin goes into more depth about why current marketing efforts are becoming inefficient and how the Internet can change the overall efficiency of marketing through better targeting and lower cost delivery (e-mail). I believe he understands the big picture better than most.<br />I am trying to continue my reading on e-mail marketing before launching my e-business and I have found Mr. Godin's books to be very easy to read and have me saying \\"That's why so and so does this and that....\\"<br />Conclusion: A must read, definitely worth the money.<br />Anyone that is interested in marketing should also look into Robert Cialdini's Influence, and The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Reis and Jack Trout.  I would also read one or two books on viral marketing. Mr. Godin's unleashing the ideavirus is the best that I have read and I have heard good things about Anatomy of a Buzz by Emmanual Rosen.  I have read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell and thought it wasn't as well written as Mr. Godin's book.	2001-10-01

This book, and Predators Ball, really started the boom in financial writing as it pertains to what it is like to actually work on Wall Street.  Having spent 3 years working for 2 different firms in research I can say that some very interesting people work on Wall Street.  Some are very average people with phenomenal work ethic whereas some are quite comparable to people out of the Wild West.<br />Anyone who is considering going into the financial services industry in trading, sales or research should read this.  I tell you to read it because it does describe how cut throat the business is and it does provide some entertaining insightful look at characters in the industry.  Liar's Poker provides a good top down look at the characters and process of Wall Street. This book, in particular, focuses on the rise of Soloman Brothers and its trading.<br />Other books of interest would be John Train's Money Masters and New Money Masters (2 different books) that discusses the world's best portfolio managers and traders.  Both are excellent reading.	2001-09-28

I read The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom about a month ago and I believe many of the things stated by Orman are right on the money.  If you are trying to do some financial planning or need some straight forward, no B.S. comments about managing your money Orman gets it.  Plain and simple.  If anyone is interested in the average American and they way they spend take a book at Credit Card Nation by Robert Manning.  It is pretty scary but, between the two books, you should understand how scary this recession could become (Manning) and how people get really emotionally tied to their money (Orman).<br />Unfortunately, I am unemployed right now but, because I had put aside 25k in cash and had zero debt, I have been able to spend my time off being with those closest to me and I have been visiting family and friends in Canada and throughout the U.S. while not having to be stressed out about my bills.<br />In the past, my life wasn't run this way and I spent and spent away.  However, I changed my ways and life has been more pleasurable since then.  After reading the book and reading her thinking on cars I have decided that my '96 olds aurora (paid for) with 76,000 miles on it, looks pretty good and has been kept in great shape.  I decided that it was worth driving the thing into the ground, as such a comparable car (250 Hp V-8 luxury...) would cost tons more and simply burden me with debt.	2001-09-28

Yeah, you read that right........business is an art...<br />The Little Book of Business Wisdom has tons of useful information (over 50 different short stories/essays) that you could apply to your business or to understand what differentiates average companies from great companies. I underlined more than average when reading this book. I read this book hoping to learn some insightful comments and business practices to apply to my business once I get it up and running. I am trying to plan for the future and all of these business leaders have experienced phenomenal success and growth or trained those business leaders. This book is definitely worth picking up and is a KEEPER! If you are interested in a comparable book worth picking up you may want to look at Every Mistake in the Book by F.J. Lennon as I found this book to be a very straight book from a guy that ran his own company.	2001-09-28

I love these small books full of great little inspiration quotes.  I believe a slightly better book is The Power of Influence - Life Lessons On Relationships by John Maxwell.<br />The key to ranking this book depends on what you are seeking to get out of the book.  I believe the title, Everyday Wisdom, is correct.  The only thing that would have been a bit more helpful would have been better organization throughout.  It seems to jump around a lot but, overall, the book is very inspirational.<br />They key to getting long-term value out of a book like this is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life.  Practice what you read essentially.  Hope this helps everyone.	2001-09-27

This book is a bunch of short stories and some good quotes. As always, it is inspirational but, being a big fan of John Maxwell, He has produced a lot better. I believe John Maxwell's book, The Power of Leadership, is an even better read for those looking to better themselves and get a peak at how the world's greatest businessmen and politicians think. Additionally, the book entitled The Power of Influence - Life Stores on Relationships, is another excellent short book. If you are seeking full blown books then the 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader is a great book!<br />They key to getting any long-term value out of Maxwell's books is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life. Practice what you read essentially. Hope this helps everyone.	2001-09-27

For example, McDonald's uses satellites to track the growth of cities and where to put their next restaurants. (2) Industrialized, automated, de-skilled meatpacking is only one of the facets of fast food that comes under scrutiny and is leading to the huge beef recalls you hear about regularly in today's society and (3) He talks about an entire industry dedicated to making your food taste and smell better.<br />Like someone earlier wrote, Fast Food Nation is serious brainfood; it might even help you supersize yours. I loved reading this book as I think it is a good dose of reality with obesity getting out of control in today's society. Just thinking about the implications arising from the exportation of fast food to the rest of the world has me concerned.	2001-09-27

The book is basically a reflection of how, after 30 years, Mr. Hill recognized how much he learned from Coach Wooden without knowing he was being taught anything at all.<br />He discusses how the Secrets of the pyramid are transferable to teaching, business, management and even friendships.<br />The book is very personal and well written.  If you are trying to become a leader or want to learn the keys to success you would gain quite a bit from reading this book.  Most importantly, just like basketball, you have to apply these secrets until they become second nature for them to have a profound impact on your life.	2001-09-27

I believe this book would be highest valued by those without extensive business backgrounds and by others that are seeking to understand why some companies are great whereas others are average. Mr. Charan explains the most important element of businesses, generating cash.  He then talks about numerous business concepts at a very basic level, which I think would help everyone (including MBAs and CEOs). At 150 pages or so it is an easy read and can be read quickly for those seeking information quickly.<br />I personally have a degree in accounting, an MBA in finance and I worked in corporate strategy.  I found this book definitely worth the while and ranks up in the top 2 of overall general business books I have read.  I am just now starting to put my reviews online.	2001-09-26
