As well as any of his writings, this book powerfully demonstrates Hemingway's prowess as a writer.  It was not the subject matter that captured me--I maintain that setting is largely irrelevant to Hemingway's stories.  Far more important is how he portrays people and the things that happen to them.  That is what drew me into this book, and that is what makes Hemingway such an amazing author.  Even if you are not into hunting, this is literature worth reading.	2004-12-30

Sure, Papa is one of my favorite fiction writers, but could he write for the stage as well as he wrote stories?<br /><br />The Fifth Column proved to be every bit as good as Hemingway's best fiction.  The deep characters and fascinating, realistic sequence of events are brilliantly written.  The reader can picture the drama as if it was being acted out before him.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to several people; some are hesitant to read it because the story's setting (the Spanish Civil War) doesn't interest them.  But in Hemingway's fiction, the setting is not as important as how people and the things that happen to them are communicated on the page.  He was a truly master writer, able to make characters and situations fascinating regardless of what the reader thought of the story's setting.<br /><br />One suggestion: I read the four short stories before I read the play, and I strongly recommend that sequence.  Reading the stories first enables you to see transition of the events from real life to Hemingway's mind, then to the page, and finally to the stage.  Seeing this transition will give the reader an appreciation for Hemingway's ability to so brilliantly put into words his own observations and experiences.<br /><br />If you are a Hemingway fan, or if you just like good fiction, it doesn't get much better than this.	2004-12-30

In volume three, Needham picks up where he left off and continues his church history masterpiece.  While no historian can be exhaustive in scope, Needham nevertheless manages to cover the great men and events in more detail than one would expect, all the while keeping things in their historical context.  Most importantly he writes interesting history!  These books are a delight to read because they display the hand of God in the acts of history.  No naturalist historians need apply!<br /><br />Needham correctly believes that Christians today can learn and profit from the lessons of the past: the battles that have already been fought, issues that have already been debated, and leaders who have come before us. And he is able to present all this information in a manner that leaves Christians excited about the great work Christ has done through His church, from the first century through to our own day.<br /><br />One of the most unique, useful, and enjoyable aspects of Needham's histories is the material he places at the end of each chapter.  There he gives samples of the primary sources about which he has just written.  These brief glimpses of the writings of the great pastors, humanists, heretics, and theologians help the history come alive to modern readers, most of whom have never interacted with these great works before.<br /><br />I eagerly await volume four.  These histories will be the standard for years to come, right up there with d'Aubigne, Wylie, Schaff, and the like.	2004-11-12

In fact, probably less than half of the book is about what Augustine did.  The rest focuses on what he believed, from his doctrine of Scripture to his soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology.  The reader gets a broad picture of not only who Augustine was, but also what impact he had on the church at his own time and beyond.<br />That being said, it is unfortunate that Bentley-Taylor's semi-Pelagian leanings come through so clearly as he writes.  When explaining Augustine's views, especially in the area of soteriology, he often discards or trivializes them as wrong or antiquated with no real argument or explanation.  I wish an Augustinian had written this biography, or at least that Bentley-Taylor had made more of an effort to argue his position rather than simply write off Augustine's views.<br />Despite this one complaint, this is very much a worthy read.  It is inspiring and comforting to learn about such a man as Augustine, particularly of how the power of the gospel changed him so drastically.  And it is a marvellously well-written biography, engaging and clear throughout.  Anyone who wishes to learn more about this giant of church history, or anyone to wants to read of a great example of God's saving power would enjoy this book.<br />171 pages	2004-05-14

Cox makes a strong case from Scripture against Scofieldism and implores those in the movement to return to Biblical teaching.  Even though today's dispensationalism has largely tried to distance itself from Scofieldism, the central tenets Cox refutes are still widely asserted.  Thus this pamphlet is useful today both to inform those outside of Scofieldism/dispensationalism of the dangers of its teaching and to appeal to those within the movement to forsake it.	2003-09-02

Edgar's writing is very concise and readable, making this book very useful for anyone from high school to graduate students, laymen and pastors alike.

Good ones, designed especially for those who teach the Bible to adults, can scarcely be found.&quot;<br />Given the pedigree of the authors, I had high expectations when I purchased this book.  I especially thought that I had found a book that approached education from a *distinctively* Christian perspective.  I was disappointed.<br />The first chapter or so was more like what I expected, discribing the need for effective Bible teaching.  But the rest of the book contains what are basically the same perspectives and techniques as any other book on education.  It was not *distinctively* Christian pedagogically speaking, but rather the same old educational theory applied to teaching the Bible.<br />Perhaps my expectations for this book were too high.  Perhaps the book I'm looking for is not yet written.  Any suggestions would be welcomed.	2003-09-02

In these pages, Murray chronicles the fall of evangelicalism in the late 20th Century.<br />Murray begins by telling his reader of Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) and his brand of theology.  In an effort to defend Christianity from the higher criticism of his contemporaries, Schleiermacher made a great distinction between the mind and the heart, the objective thought and the subjective passions.  He rejected the objective and taught that true Christianity was solely subjective, thus unassailable by higher criticism.<br />After his description of Schleiermacher, Murray shifts gears to the earlier half of the 20th Century and describes the events that transpired from that time to the present day.  While careful not to slander anyone, he names names and gives example after example of a shift in attitude and approach from standing upon truth to compromise in the name of proclaiming the gospel.<br />As one reads through this book, at some point or another Murray's connection will strike him: modern evangelicalism has fallen into Scheiermacher-like beliefs, and most of its leaders don't even realize it.  It's shocking and its implications hit very close to home, but Murray's conclusions are true.<br />After reading this book, I was grieved by some of the compromises I had made in the past.  It permanently altered my perspective, and I am thankful I read it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any Christian who is interested in learning from the past, and I implore pastors and church leaders everywhere to read it so that the listing evangelical church might be righted again.	2003-03-18

His aim, as stated in the preface, is to provide \\"motivated lay people and beginning theological students\\" with a method for biblical interpretation that is more practical and less technical.  Through this approach, He Gave Us Stories appeals to a wider audience than a more scholarly volume would.<br />The principle idea of He Gave Us Stories is that the Old Testament narratives provide not simply a history of the Jewish people, but a revelation of God and the imperatives He has given man.  However, because these truths are in story format, they must be interpreted to be of use to God's people today.<br />The backbone of the book is Dr. Pratt's three-fold approach to Biblical interpretation.  The first four chapters cover the subject of \\"Preparing for Old Testament Narratives,\\" the middle eight chapters deal with \\"Investigating the Old Testament Narratives,\\" and the final four chapters are on \\"Applying the Old Testament Narratives.\\"  Dr. Pratt likens this approach to an archaeologist, who much invest a great deal of time, thought, and effort as he prepares for his project, searches for his treasures, and transports his discoveries home.<br />He Gave Us Stories provides more a simple method of hermeneutics than a formal system of biblical theology.  With the exception of Chapter 12: Overview of Old Testament Narratives, the purpose, structure, and content of this book are pointed toward the exposition and application of individual texts.<br />This book is a useful tool for students and teachers of the Bible alike.  Dr. Pratt has succeeded in making it accessible to those who are not textual and hermeneutical scholars.  In particular, his focus on the stories of the Old Testament make the overall approach to understanding all the more appealing.  Surely no person, learned or not, would be uninterested in stories.  And certainly not these stories, since they are from God himself and teach us how to live our lives.  The thread of stories weaves its way throughout the book.<br />The structure of He Gave Us Stories is also commendable.  Dr. Pratt takes the principles of hermeneutics - a very complex subject indeed - organizes them, and states them in an uncomplicated way.  And the ability to make the profound appear simple, according to C.S. Lewis, is the mark of true genius.imself and teach us how to live our lives.

The back cover of this book has the following quotes from book critics:<br />\\"...the literary style is a model of English clarity....\\"<br />\\"...the logic is beautiful....\\"<br />\\"...refreshing honesty pervades the entire book....\\"<br />These critics are not exaggerating!  This book is one of the great masterpieces of Christian philosophy and apologetics.  The flagship of Clark's thought, it is brilliantly written and reasoned from beginning to end.<br />Religion, Reason, and Revelation is made up of five chapters.  The first answers the question, Is Christianity a religion?  Here Clark lays the groundwork from which he reasons.  He covers the issues of what religion is, emotion v. intellect, the description v. presupposition, meaningful words, and what constitutes Christianity.<br />The second chapter deals with the relationship between faith and reason.  Clark argues that the only true relationship between the two is a reason that is founded on faith.  In his usual manner, Clark critiques natural theology, the cosmological argument, impiricism, irrationalism, and everyone from Hume to Hodge.<br />The third chapter covers inspiration and language, what the Bible claims, objections to inspiration, problems with linguistics, logical positivism, and the like.<br />The fourth chapter is Clark's thought on revelation and morality.  How can men know what is right and wrong?  Is there a universal standard for ethical decision-making?  What roles do experience and reason play in determining morality?<br />The final chapter is God and Evil, the perennial objection to Christianity.  After explaining what he believes to be the biblical view of the problem of evil, Clark forcefully asserts, \\"Let it be unequivocally said that this view certainly makes God the cause of sin.\\"  He further explains the law's relation to both God and man, causality v. authorship, etc.<br />As one can see, Clark dives into each topic and discusses them great breadth and depth.  Religion, Reason, and Revelation is a very thorough philosophical text.<br />While those unfamiliar with Clark's thinking will find this book a most unusual read, I believe that those who think through his arguments will find them intriguing.  He was certainly one of the most original thinkers of any era, and those who thoughtfully read this book will enjoy having their minds stretched and their beliefs challenged.tion is a very thorough philosophical text.<br />While those unfamiliar with Clark's thinking will find this book a most unusual read, I believe that those who think through his arguments will find them intriguing.

This book is one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking I've ever read!  It is the published form of a 1985 debate between Christian evidentialist apologist Gary Habermas and atheistic philosopher Antony G.N. Flew concerning the question, &quot;Did Jesus rise from the dead?&quot;  The question was limited to historicity of the resurrection of Jesus Christ - other topics, such as the existence of God and the verifiability of miracles, were off limits.  After each debater gave an opening statement, a rebuttal, and the two went &quot;head-to-head&quot;, the judges voted 7-2 (one draw) in favor of Habermas as winner of the debate.<br />This book is incredibly interesting.  Part One is the formal debate, as described above.  Part Two is a transcript of the discussion between Flew, Habermas, Terry L. Miethe, and W. David Beck that took place the night after the debate.  Part Three consists of responses to the debate by Wolfhart Pannenberg, Charles Hartshorne, and J.I. Packer.  Part Four is a final response by Habermas to the issue of the resurrection.<br />No matter what your religious or philosophical background, if you are interested at all in whether or not it is reasonable to believe in the miraculous, particularly in the Christian claim that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, this book will fascinate you.

Henry gave in 1989 at Rutherford House in Edinburgh.<br />Henry begins by showing Christians how they have abandoned their \\"intellectual birthright\\" and settled for \\"a mess of pseudo-intellectual pottage.\\"  He argues that modern Evangelicals have in fact cast off their moral and epistemic moorings by trading the foundation of Scripture for anti-Christian thought systems.  Henry identifies the decay of Western society as the result of this trade.<br />Henry then argues that a return to the presuppositional method, founded upon the axioms given by God in Scripture, will return Christianity to its proper place in the intellectual arena and cause a radical change in the church.  Only then, says Henry, will we again drink from the \\"eternal springs\\" found in the glorious truths of God's Word and drastically alter our sinking society.<br />Marvellously written and enjoyable to read, I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in Christian thought and desires to see the destructive trends of our society reversed.	2002-12-09

Written while imprisoned in Bedford gaol for nonconformity, these two treatises show Christians the beauty, power, and awe of true prayer.  In the first, Bunyan describes prayer as being &quot;in the Spirit&quot;, and &quot;with understanding&quot; (1 Cor. 14:15).  In the second, the theme is the Christian's privilege of approaching &quot;the Throne of Grace&quot; (Heb. 4:16).<br />Beware! says Bunyan.  &quot;You are not a Christian if you are not a praying person.  The promise is that every one that is righteous shall pray (Ps. 32:6).  You then are a wicked wretch if you do not.&quot;  Surely this is a serious call to prayer!<br />But he also gives an encouragement: &quot;If [God] had said, I will commune with thee from my throne of judgment, then indeed you might have trembled and fled from the face of the great and glorious Majesty.  But when he says he will hear and commune with souls upon the throne of grace, or from the mercy-seat, this should encourage you, and cause you to hope, nay, to 'come boldly unto the throne of grace, that you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'&quot;  Surely this is a wonderful word for Christian and non-Christian alike - God is on his Throne of Grace, and He can be approached through prayer!<br />Read this book, and learn of the true biblical understanding of prayer from one of the greatest writers in all history!	2002-09-17

Lewis originally wrote them for kids, but I'm an adult and I read them regularly! They are true classics, marvellously written and essential reading for any age. The Harper Collins one-volume edition (ISBN 0060281375) is the best I've found. It is a sturdy hardback, well-bound with good paper. The illustrations are marvellous! They aren't large and obtrusive - they don't overwhelm the text. But they truly capture the magical, mystical feel of the stories. I was taken by surprise when I first read this edition - the books are in a different order than I was used to. I'd previously read them in order of authorship, while this edition places them in chronological order. I believe I like it this way better, now that I've gotten used to it. The price is actually quite low for the quality of the book, too. Of all the editions I've seen of this must-have collection, it is the best one I've found. If you want to buy the Chronicles of Narnia, buy the Harper Collins one-volume edition!	2002-05-30

Girardeau.  Douglas Kelly is a captivating writer, and he presents these four men in a way that is both informative and enjoyable to read:  He begins with their lives, discussing each in brief detail, from childhood through education and ministry to death.  Kelly then devotes a chapter specifically to the preaching of these four men.  Reading of their faithfulness and boldness while preaching the Word of God through trials and tests and learning about the beautiful work God did through them will certainly touch anyone who shares their love for good preaching, pastors and laymen alike.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn some of the history of American preaching and praise God for His work through four faithful men.	2002-05-19

It presents the four main eschatological positions in the words of accomplished theologians: G.E. Ladd on historic premillennialism, H.A. Hoyt on dispensational premillenialism, L. Boettner on postmillenialism, and A.A. Hoekema on amillenialism.  Each chapter begins with one of these men stating their position on the &quot;end times&quot;, followed by rebuttal from the other three.  This dialogue format is excellent - much credit goes to the editor, R. Clouse.<br />Each chapter is very well-written, as one would expect from such prominent men, with the exception perhaps of postmillenialism.  Boettner presents a basic statement of the postmillenial viewpoint, but his use of Scripture in explaining and supporting his argument is sparse, which weakens it somewhat.  The other three men did a fine job.<br />If you are interested in this long-standing debate or if you simply wish to determine where you stand, this is a good book to start with because it addresses the four basic positions and because of its dialogue format.  You probably won't have all your questions answered simply by reading this book, but you will certainly have your thoughts stirred!	2002-05-18

I believe members of the Roman church would find this book a difficult read because it says so many things that go against what their church has taught them, but Reymond's solid and thorough arguments are difficult to reject. He doesn't find just one verse or historical fact as support for his position; rather, he backs up what he says with verse after verse, history after history, in his customary thoughtful style. This book is a MUST READ for Protestants who want to want to understand the doctrine of Rome and its inherent problems. Members of the church of Rome, I recommend that you read this book, too. Even though it won't be easy, I think you, too, will find it profitable.	2002-03-26

From beginning to end, this is a beautiful work on how a Christian is to live in order to please God.  Lewis Bayly, Bishop of Bangor, originally wrote this book in the early 1600's.  It went through more than 70 editions by 1800, and was translated into several European and Native American languages.<br />Bayly's love for God can be seen from the first, as he meditates upon His essence, person, and attributes in the first chapter.  The depth of his insight and passion is a great example of the Puritan concept of God.<br />From God, Bayly turns to man, displaying his need for conversion and his need for piety.  He writes not only about the overarching theological ideas on this subject, but also dives deep into the mechanics of individual and family prayer, meditation, Bible reading, and singing.<br />To Bayly, piety was something to be lived all day, every day.  Therefore, the material in this book begins with the moment we awake, runs through the day, and ends with the moment we return to sleep.  In times of health, sickness, and even death itself, Bayly calls the Christian to follow Christ in every time of life.<br />This is not an easy read!  As with so many of the Puritans, the quantity of information dealt with in just one chapter is enough for us to meditate on for a long time.  But if you read through this book, you will certainly feel a passion stirred within your own soul, calling you to Christ-likeness and piety.	2002-03-26

Rather, this is Sproul's rejection of the soteriological portions of recent documents signed by prominent representatives of the Roman and Protestant churches in an attempt to bring unity between the two.  He argues that despite claims on both sides that an accord on the subjects of justification, sanctification, faith, grace, etc. has been reached, no true unity has been attained - the two sides are still in disagreement over the nature of Christ's saving work.<br /><br />Further, Sproul argues that this attempt at harmony is damaging to the knowledge and spreading of the true Gospel as communicated in the Bible.  He chastises Protestants for not knowing how to precisely and accurately put the Gospel into words and calls them to correct that problem before more damage is done.<br /><br />Don't let the other reviews fool you - this book is an excellent exposition of the Biblical position of the nature of mankind's salvation through the work of Christ.  The series of Affirmations and Denials that constitute a majority of this book are one of the clearest defenses of this position you can find.  But for those who are still not convinced or for those who seek to read even further regarding the Biblical and historical errors of the modern Roman position, see Robert L.

He says a lot in this nearly 400-page book and asks questions church leaders need to answer.<br />But The Purpose Driven Church proves that asking the right questions does not necessarily lead to the right answers.  While this book has a lot of good things to say about the concept of purpose, it fails in its methodology.  Warren's pragmatic ideas regarding church growth, preaching, worship, etc, ignore the spiritual ramifications of what he is writing about.  Before churches can truly grow spiritually, their leaders and members must have a change of heart even more than a change of habit, and only God can change hearts.  Rick Warren, and indeed every church leader, needs to remember that.<br />Despite any weaknesses of methodology, The Purpose Driven Church succeeds in pointing church leaders toward having a purpose, as well as giving them some good ideas and a solid framework for implementing one.

In this book, Jay Adams does an excellent job of advocating purposeful preaching; he rightly portrays the alternative as a deadly practice of obscuring truth. His description of finding the telos, or end, of a passage of scripture to determine its chief meaning is right on target and could help any pastor keep his preaching on track.<br /><br />However, the value of this book is damaged by Adams's arguments. The problem is not what he says, but rather how he says it. Adams attacks anyone and everyone he can get his hands on, from today's preachers to professors in academic institutions to the churchgoing public and more. While he has a right to criticize what he sees as wrong, the aggressiveness with which he criticizes reduces his credibility.<br /><br />Adams also has a bad habit of quoting himself. Not that a writer should not make reference to his other works, but Adams frequently quotes himself when he could just as easily and more forcefully refer to the works of others. This habit sometimes makes him sound arrogant and unread.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this is a solid book, and Adams has many good things to say about the weight and purpose of preaching. Any preacher should digest what Adams has to say. But when you read this book, be warned: Some of those razorblades are sharp.	2001-11-24

Many books are published these days with the name &quot;Spurgeon&quot; on them.  However, so many of these books are edited down adaptations of something Spurgeon wrote or preached.  Too often these &quot;books&quot; are actually 3 or 4 sermons cut apart and taped together into a book format.  The unfortunate result is that much of Spurgeon's beliefs, exhortations, and theology are lost, and all that remains is his poetic style.  Few publishers have remained true to the real Spurgeon, instead using his name to sell books and make money.  Their finished product is watered-down milk, psychology at best, instead of the real meat of the real Spurgeon's preaching.<br />This book, however, is the REAL Spurgeon!  This is a collection of over 50 of his sermons, the REAL unedited sermons, and many more expositions of Scripture as they were published in 1892.  Read this book and hear the meat of Spurgeon, the depth and conviction with which he preached, and the consistency with which his theology rests upon Scripture.<br />And these sermons are not just historical pieces; they are useful to us even today!  No Christian can read this book and not find his soul challenged, uplifted, convicted, and educated in knowledge and wisdom.  The Victorian Londoners found Spurgeon's ministry to be all these things, and since that time it has had its effect on so many others, too - and it can have that effect on you!<br />This book is published by Banner of Truth, one of the greatest publishing houses of our day.  Their faithfulness to truth is an example to the publishers who just seek to publish what will sell.<br />This book is a great shelf volume, well-bound and durable.  Read it every day, and it will still wear well.<br />Perhaps you've heard the new Spurgeon, the one created by so many modern publishers and editors.  If you want to know what his sermons were REALLY like, and if you want your soul to be taught and ministered to by the &quot;Prince of Preachers&quot; himself, read this book!is book!	2001-10-03

I strongly recommend that anyone going to Central Asia get this book.  It is full of necessary phrases that will help you get where you need to go.  It is very compact and can fit easily into a pocket.  It is also very comprehensive, containing large sections of phrases in Uyghur, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Pashto, and Tajik, plus smaller sections on ten other regional languages.  Also, it has a section outlining the history of Central Asian languages and certain grammatical/linguistic essentials.<br />Again, if you are going to Central Asia, invest in this book!	2001-09-02

This is a very enjoyable collection, and if you are a fan of C.S. Lewis: Read these letters and get inside this great philosopher's mind!	2001-09-02

While touring London, I carried 5 or 6 different books and maps with me, not knowing which one was \\"the best\\" but wanting to have all my bases covered. However, while I was actually in the city, this was virtually THE ONLY book I used.<br />This book has maps of the whole city so you can get the general idea of its layout, plus a map of the various zones of London so you can find anything if you have its zone number.<br />It also has a map of the tube lines and stations, which comes in extremely handy - the underground is the fastest, cheapest, and easiest way of getting from place to place in London.<br />A majority of the book consists of fold-out maps of the various districts of London, from Notting Hill to City and Southwark, each having detailed street layouts and point of interest labels. With each of these maps are reviews of the district's best restaurants, cafes, bars/pubs/nightliffe, shopping, and sights, all of which we found handy (unlike many of the other books).<br />The whole book is color coded, so it is easy to find each section. And it's so small and easy to carry! The book is maybe 5x7 inches and less than an inch thick.<br />Again I say, if you're going to London, this book is the one you need. Leave those other ones at home; you won't need them - I didn't!	2001-07-25

A great majority of the book is devoted to the events leading up to the initial publication, while the minority is about its actual effects. When one considers the promises made by the title of the book, it is quite a disappointment.<br />Second, I found McGrath's style of writing to be somewhat dull and slow. He is very scholarly, and I am one who usually appreciates such a take on a subject, but McGrath is far too verbose and repetitive for my tastes. And I would hardly call his witticisms hilarious.<br />Third, it seems as if this publishing project didn't have an editor; there are spelling and grammar mistakes, and whole passages of the book that seem to repeat themselves.<br />If you are interested in the religious climate of England in the Medieval period and the events leading up to the publication of the Bible in English vernacular, then this book is for you. However, if you are looking for a book that is about the King James Bible, prepare to be disappointed.	2001-07-25

His scholarship, attention to detail, insight, knowledge of the Scriptures, and application of the Scriptures are unsurpassed.<br />This collection is well worth having.  It is almost entirely a collection of Manton's sermons, taken from a wide variety of texts.<br />Volume one includes a memoir by Dr. William Harris, an exposition of the Lord's prayer, seven sermons on the Transfiguration, eight sermons on Colossians 1, and seven sermons on Christ's Temptation.  The latter are my personal favorite from the entire collection.<br />Volume two includes &quot;An Estimate of Manton&quot; by J.C. Ryle, 10 discourses &quot;to promote peace and holiness among Christians,&quot; twenty sermons on assorted Scriptures, and four sermons on death.<br />Volume three includes 18 sermons on II Thessalonians 2 and an exposition of Isaiah 53 (also an incredible work).<br />All three volumes in this set are well-bound, as is common for Banner of Truth.  They are sturdy and will not come apart, even with common use.  Any one of these volumes is worth the price of this set.  But you can get all three of them for that price!<br />Anyone who knows the puritans in general and Manton in particular understands the depth in these sermons, the thoroughness with which the subjects and Scriptures are expounded, and the directness of their applications to the life of the Christian.<br />Any pastor or Bible teacher who is going to teach on these subjects or passages should read what Manton has to say about them.  Anyone who does will find them to be a useful tool in drawing out the full meaning of the doctrines of the Bible and applying those truths straight into the heart of the Christian.	2001-07-25

While unusual and somewhat technical in format, this book  provides the reader with a strong overview of this particular theological  system, sound Biblical arguments against it, and a preparation for  interaction with people who believe these doctrines.  While some of the  reviewers commented that E. Calvin Beisner was unfair, unsound, and  condescending in this book, I did not find that to be the case.  His  representation of Oneness theology is accurate and fair, taken from its  main writings; his arguments are logically and Bibically sound and  well-articulated; and his tone was one of care rather than one of  harshness.  I recommend this book to anyone in the Oneness Pentacostal  system who wants to see how its arguments stand against Scripture, or  anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with this movement and how it  relates to God's Word.	2000-09-18

That was what I asked myself the first time I read this  book.  Is he really saying what I think he's saying?  I was blown away.  This is one of the most profound books that I have ever read.  The insight  that John Piper shows into the very nature of God is amazing.  He then  applies that insight to how all Christians should live, truly glorifying  God with their entire lives and finding their pleasure and fulfillment in  living for Him.  EVERY CHRISTIAN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.  It will shatter  your existing faith, whatever you believe about God and your relationship  with Him right now, and replace it with something incredible, unfathomable,  and awe-inspiring.  This is an amazing work that I highly recommend to  anyone who wants to understand God and live as He desires.	2000-08-04

I have never read its equal. In Christianity today, there is so much emphasis on a quick conversion and the  love and mercy of God, but rarely does a teacher speak on the difficult  topic of the strain and pain and longevity of the daily walk with Christ.  The disciplines of a Christian are similar to the disciplines of one  running a marathon, the Apostle Paul teaches, and Dallas Willard has taken  a careful examination of these disciplines. He declares that Christianity  can only be a relevant guide for modern humanity if it takes the need for  human transformation through the Holy Spirit seriously, and clarify and  exemplify realistic methods of this transformation by modeling it ourselves  as Christians. Willard goes into great detail concerning the disciplines as  the method by which Christians model the work of the Spirit in their lives.  He declares that they are the very nature of life itself for Christians and  that only by consistently teaching and practicing them will Christ's church  be the force required for true spiritual change in today's society. A  masterful work, this book should be in the library of any Christian that  seeks to truly live the life of Christ and be a light in the world today.	2000-07-31

Eliot is known as one of the world's foremost poets and playwrights, but this book shows him as a brilliant essayist, philosopher, and theologian as well. This book consists of two essays: &quot;The Idea of a  Christian Society&quot; and &quot;Notes Toward the Definition of  Culture.&quot; In these two essays, Eliot displays his mental prowess by  cutting to the heart of the issues of culture in general in the second  essay and specifically Christian culture in the first. His analysis of  these subjects is very orderly, well-thought, and deeper than most any  written today, even by sociologists and the like who make a career of  studying these things. Eliot breaks culture down into three subclasses:  individual, group/class, and whole society. He begins with the individual  level of society, analyzing personality characteristics and the like, and  moves his way up into group/class and then to the whole society, giving an  extremely thoughtful and insightful argument into how these elements  relate. Although this book was written over 50 years ago and isn't the most  conventional look at these subjects, many of the things Eliot asserts are  becoming obvious in today's society, proving him as not only a great writer  but also as an accomplished thinker. He goes into great detail on class,  geographic regions, sects, politics, religion, and education in relation to  culture and society. While the writing is a bit more verbose and difficult  than the average modern reader is used to, it is extremely logical; Eliot  carefully builds each argument one step at a time. This order makes it  possible to gain a great deal of understanding if the reader is willing to  wade through the text and ponder what is written. I guarantee that even  though many readers won't necessarily understand initially or perhaps agree  with everything Eliot asserts in this book, anyone who reads it will end up  with a far greater understanding of the workings of society. I recommend  this bookto anyone who is willing to be stretched in an intellectual way  and anyone who seeks to gain a great insight into culture at its various  levels and as a whole.	2000-07-31

Clowney asserts that the call of God is both distinctive and clear, dispelling the idea so common today that a calling is some emotional  feeling: that a person might be called into some unknown service of the  Lord, but one cannot be sure.  Clowney devalues such an argument.  He also  describes the calling to the ministry as personal - we bear God's name and  He calls us by our own in love - and as an occupation of service.  Clowney  approaches the whole subject by an entirely different route than most  writers in today's church do.  He does not write from sentiment or  idealism, but rather portrays things as they are, as they are described in  the scriptures.  This is a book that everyone who is currently in the  ministry or is considering entering it should read.  The person who does  will be given an enlightenment and direction that few other books today  offer.	2000-07-01

I am her nephew, and I was a participant in some of the school activities, family events,  and special occaisions this book describes.  This is not a  how-to-homeschool book; rather, I think it is best described as one  family's autobiography through the eyes of homeschooling.  After a long  struggle with cancer, the author went to be with her Lord on St. Patrick's  Day, 2000, but she left behind her the legacy of eight homeschooled  children, three of whom went &quot;all the way through high school.&quot;  She was blessed by God in her earthly roles as mother, wife, teacher,  businesswoman, encourager, manager of people, follower of Christ, and  student of life.  Her efforts were centered around her family and the other  people in her life.  Even during her last days, she did interviews from her  hospital bed on national radio to promote her book and encourage  homeschoolers everywhere.  Her spirit is spread throughout this book.  The  text was written not only by Renee Mason, but numerous sections were  written by other family members as well.  It is not a smooth prose from the  hand of a literary genius, but rather out of each section emerges the  personality of its writer - each piece of the book sounds like the person  who wrote it.  Because of that, this book feels down to earth, normal, and  natural, and gives the reader a sense of actually being a part of what's  written.  If you are a homeschooler or a person just interested in the  subject, I recommend this book to you.  Unlike other books on this topic,  Home-Schooling All the Way Through High School is not a reference for  step-by-step instructions on what to do to begin and finish homeschooling.  Instead, it is a book that will give you insight into and a true feel for  the day-to-day life of one family through the lenses of homeschooling.	2000-06-24

Scougal, who began his illustrious ministerial and academic career in his teenage years and only lived into his late twenties, has some of the deepest insights into the definition of being a Christian that have ever been printed. He discusses a person's conversion, thoroughly describing the roles of God and man in justification. Scougal then goes into great detail concerning the ramifications of that experience into a Christian's life: he dives deep into the effect of a person's new-found way of life upon his or her mind, will, and affections. His ability to describe the process of sanctification in an orderly, vivid, descripitive, and passionate way in unparalleled. The book is actually a long letter from Scougal to one of his theological peers who had recently lost heart in his pursuit of God, so the book itself challenges the reader to grow, yet reads warmly and is uplifting. The only obstacle is that most editions of this book (if not all) are in the original Middle English, making the full meaning of the words and phrases a little difficult at times for the modern reader. The author's logical flow and warmth of spirit make up for that, though, and make this book one of the most thorough and challenging descriptions of Christian justification and sanctification theology ever.	2000-06-20

This book reflects that.  Piper applies the principle of God's Sovereignty to  preaching in his usual passionate, concise style: Preaching should be  God-centered because the Bible, our faith, our salvation, and our very  existence are God-centered.

Lewis originally wrote them for kids, but I'm an adult and I read them regularly! They are true classics, marvellously written and essential reading for any age. This edition is one of the best I've found. It is a sturdy hardback, well-bound with good paper. The illustrations are marvellous! They aren't large and obtrusive - they don't overwhelm the text. But they truly capture the magical, mystical feel of the stories. I was taken by surprise when I first read this edition - the books are in a different order than I was used to. I'd previously read them in order of authorship, while this edition places them in chronological order. I believe I like it this way better, now that I've gotten used to it. The price is actually quite low for the quality of this book, too. Of all the editions I've seen of this must-have collection, this is the best one I've found.

Hodge is strong not only in what he explains, but also how he explains it.  Each section is divided into questions, as if someone was interviewing Hodge.  He then answers each question in a very logical, ordered manner, giving the  reader a very clear perception of each particular concept.  Hodge leaves  nothing uncovered, but rather touches on a very wide spectrum of Reformed  theology, and every time his argument is succinct and backed with  scripture.  Everyone interested in theology, clergy or lay-person, should  read this book to gain a deeper understanding of what the Reformed  persuasion believes and why.	2000-06-14
