Great start--snappy dialogue (and pieces of that snap are scattered throughout the book so you know the guy's smart).<br /><br />But the problem is that after a rock solid hardboiled start, things get way too complicated to really make this hardboiled pulp fiction. It winds up being a puzzle mystery, NOT a tough crime novel--puzzle mysteries are the kind that all those smart mystery writers wrote, and still write. They're in their own league--not hardboiled, not cozy. Smart, but the novels always start with a murder and then some genius woman or man figures out how all the pieces fit together.<br /><br />So, yes, there is a murder. There are a couple of babes. But they don't count for much in the story; they're a diversion that the author seems to have thrown in to try to make this appear to be a hardboiled novel. Didn't work.<br /><br />Hardboiled fiction is about base instincts and while that is certainly the motivating factors for the events in the novel, in no way could this be considered hardboiled fiction because the delivery is just too cerebral. Hardboiled fiction is about base instinct, but delivered in a style that matches those instincts--that's pulp. And just because something's called pulp doesn't mean it's bad. Not at all. Good pulp is great reading. For example, read Dan Marlowe for GREAT hardboiled fiction. Or Dashiell Hammett, especially Red Harvest which remains one of my absolute favorite hardboiled novels, written in 1929!!<br /><br />Top of the Heap, as one reviewer pointed out here, has a title that is completely obscure. There's no way of figuring out what it refers to. The cover blurb says something about \\"She made her way to the top...\\", or something, but no woman in the novel is a main character. That honor belongs to Donald Lam, half of the Lam and Cool Detective Agency; the other half is a blustering, ultra-tough woman, Bertha Cool, who cusses out her partner Lam for blowing money.<br /><br />By the time the reader gets to the end of the novel, the last 15 pages or so are pure explication and go on and on and on about how this person did this and that person did that and so on, and so forth, neatly fitting all the pieces of the puzzle together. To be blunt, this was a real drag to read.<br /><br />I recommend The Name of the Game is Death by Dan Marlowe, the aforementioned Red Harvest by Hammett, and a whole lot of stuff by Jim Thompson, David Goodis, and a few other guys--as well as Ride the Pink Horse by Dorothy Hughes, one of the best hardboiled novels ever. But Top of the Heap is just too smart for its own good to be counted as hardboiled.<br /><br />Hard Case Crime is putting out a brand new original novel by Stephen King in October 2005. Here's hoping that will be more hardboiled than this one./>By the time the reader gets to the end of the novel, the last 15 pages or so are pure explication and go on and on and on about how this person did this and that person did that and so on, and so forth, neatly fitting all the pieces of the puzzle together.

This time, it's early 21st century so things have changed dramatically since the time of pachinko parlors run by Robert Ryan as a front for crime operations.<br /><br />Greed is more personal these days.  It's typified by Jessica Romano, a sexy femme fatale who makes a nice chunk of change as a white girl desired by Asian men.  They pay through the nose for her, but she wants more.  With her half-Japanese, half-Flipino boyfriend Taro, she plans kidnapping her latest would-be sugar daddy Zeniya, a supposed salaryman (Japanese businessman) who's already shown her his stash of a million bucks in his home.<br /><br />Enter Chris Ryan, Jessica's \\"friend\\" from back home and a narrow-minded slacker who's good at two things: drug dealing and being selfish.  Chris hooks up with Jessica and Taro in the kidnapping plot and this adds a wild element to the plot that lets it spin into crazier directions than it would otherwise.  That's not a condemnation--not at all.<br /><br />The author, Patrick Foss, gives the reader a detailed look at today's Japan, all the way down to the drink Pocari Sweat (now sold in New York City's Grand Central Station, of all places). He lives in Japan, so no wonder! But it takes a skilled writer to do this well, and he is.  He does a great job; you feel like you really are in Japan. His characterizations of the selfish, greedy Americans are just as well done as those of the brutal Japanese yakuza who enter the picture at exactly the wrong time for our anti-heroes.<br /><br />Since yakuza are involved, it's clear that things do not exactly work out as the kidnappers planned.  That's a mild understatement. The plot zips along like a well-oiled thriller machine with a great bunch of smashing turns of event along the way leading up to a more than satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Great piece of work to both pump the juices inside you and at the same time give you a real taste of today's Japan.<br /><br />Recommended.rk to both pump the juices inside you and at the same time give you a real taste of today's Japan. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-03-26
US	49545974	R5SKY0JLIM9UY	0515136433	564163973	Man Eater	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great premise for a black comedy thriller	You have to wonder why no one thought of this before (at least that I'm aware of).  The premise is very clever here and makes for a great read, along with the slick writing.  What if a hotshot movie producer, a total babe, while at a local bar, came to the aid of a sleazy [...] being battered left and right by a big, muscular thug, bashing the guy over the head with a beer bottle?  At the same time, what if an ex-con wrote a great screenplay and had dreams of selling it, and the producer, coincidentally enough, had this screenplay in one of a stack of 50 or so to read?  And what if the big ugly thug found out where the babe lived and did some unspeakable things to her, then gave her 5 days to pay up or die?  If the ex-con was also pretty muscular, maybe he could protect the babe.  If, of course, he wanted to sell his screenplay.<br /><br />Very clever.  This is the central premise and while it may sound that the story's given away here, relax.  There's a bunch of surprises in store for the reader and the author, Ray Shannon (pseudonym for an actual screenwriter, Gar Anthony Haywood) is really smart and knows plotting like Lipton knows tea.  This baby has solid momentum and yes, WOULD make a great thriller on screen.<br /><br />Shannon/Haywood is smart enough to know exactly how to raise the stakes by introducing other characters who will add to the tension and drive the momentum onward like a non-stop freight train.  The thug, the ex-con, and the producer are the three leads, but also here are a couple of low-life brothers, the aforementioned [...], the producer's back-stabbing rival, as well as her neurotic boss, her ex-husband and son, the ex-con's ex-wife and daughter, and a pimply, vicious drug dealer.<br /><br />Throw these all together with a perfectly plotted story, as well as the slick writing, and you got yourself a winner.  A fine piece of work.  Stretching credibility?  Hey, if it's done right, that's what makes fiction a lot of fun.  And in this novel, trust me, it's done right.ht.	2004-12-31

Writers represented here include Robert Coover, Susan Sontag, Francine Prose, Rick Moody, Stephen Dobyns, Charles Baxter, and 20 more; the films they've selected are a really interesting group of movies, ranging from, believe it or not, the Japanese 60s cheesefest Destroy All Monsters! to The Godfather to Titicut Follies, among others.<br /><br />What's also interesting is the diversity in the length of the pieces.  Richard Howard turns in a punchy little 2 pages on Robert Bresson's Un Homme Echappe (A Man Escaped), while Edward Hirsch (unknown to me) waxes at length--32 pages--on the film Stevie.  Aside from those mentioned in the last sentence, directors represented include Chabrol, Buster Keaton, Vincent Gallo (the great Buffalo 66), Polanski, Fassbinder, Coppola, Wajda, Truffaut, Antonioni, Huston, Godard, and, interestingly, Samuel Beckett for the film version of Quadra.<br /><br />A fascinating read for film fanatics, or for those who love literary fiction--or just plain great prose.  Definitely recommended!	2004-12-18
US	49545974	R31IP36JQ0ZKEV	0385511132	543228813	Dogs of God	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Well written, but...	This is a peculiar novel in that while meant to be a thriller, in essence, there are so many points/sections/chunks in which the author is clearly in love with his own ability to write that he expounds at great length re trivial items about which the reader really has little or no interest.  Too bad, because Benedict is a writer whose technique is obvious.<br /><br />But if a novel is meant to be a thriller, even if a literary one, it should move.  And unfortunately there is just too much text bogging this down to really make it gather the momentum it should.  There's no question that the author can draw convincing characters, even if peculiarly named, but he is inconsistent in the extent to which he describes/defines these characters, seemingly based on his whim.  That is, some characters are fully fleshed out and others, even non-minor ones, are not much more than one-dimensional almost cartoon-like characters.<br /><br />This inconsistency is weirdly reminiscent of the ill-fated remake of the film Cape Fear directed by Scorsese, in which DeNiro's Max Cady was so all over the place that it was impossible to see clearly exactly what the film was doing.  In the case of Dogs of God, the major distraction derailing what could have been a powerful piece of work is, as mentioned, the author's obsessive need to trumpet his own writing ability.<br /><br />There is no real main character, per se.  Goody, a young bare knuckles fighter in rural Appalachia, is ostensibly meant to fill this role, but Benedict throws in so many other characters that it is impossible to cast Goody as the real focus of attention.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but when, for example, the writer details the problems one character has with lighting one match after another to try to ignite a car--sparing no expense to insure the reader understands how difficult lighting a match REALLY CAN BE--tedium sets in rapidly and quickly and easily destroys whatever momentum might possibly have been built prior to this scene.<br /><br />And there are many, many scenes like this one.  It's interesting to contrast this novel with A Single Shot, Matthew Jones' masterful literary thriller.  Jones knows that momentum is the KEY to a great thriller and he knows exactly how to build it.  He doesn't waste time with trivialities like Benedict does.<br /><br />Dogs of God's \\"bad guy\\", Tannhauser, as Max Cady is described above, is all over the place.  With six fingers on each hand, a maverick marijuana grower with an \\"impregnable\\" fortress, in one scene he lords it over his Hispanic workers; in another, he spouts insane gibberish about interplanetary aliens among us; in another, he exhorts a younger man to kill Goody.  The focus is lost.<br /><br />The three stars here are because Benedict definitely knows how to write and that is clearly evident in his short stories which are punchy, powerful, and intelligent pieces of work.

Melville was, for his time, a radical filmmaker who embraced American film noir and, for that matter, American film in general.  His influence can easily be perceived in the work of many other directors, both contemporary with his time, and later, including, among others, Truffaut, Tarantino, and John Woo.  Indeed, Tarantino and Woo are mentioned here, as is Truffaut and Godard.  Melville's famous falling out with the latter is highlighted--this followed a period in which Godard professed admiration for Melville.  The turnabout is of some real interest.<br />As this is a current book, Vincendeau naturally did not have the opportunity to speak to Melville directly, as did Nogueira.  But she does much with what is known of Melville and offers insights into his character that Nogueira did not.  Her dissection of his films is truly first-rate; she analyzes both the films, objectively, and Melville's personal involvement in each of them.  Her discussion of the director's perspective on society--what makes it tough, what makes it bearable, what gives it meaning--dovetails nicely with her observations on his work as a filmmaker.<br />One of the great things about buying the Criterion DVD release of Le Cercle Rouge is that it includes an excerpt from the Nogueira book in which Melville himself talks about that film.  The Vincendeau book is indispensable for those who want a penetrating examination of one of the greatest of all French filmmakers.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-06-14

While certainly not up to date in its filmography, it's worth owning for any Cronenberg fan to get a nice panorama of perspectives on the filmmaker who used to be known as Dave &quot;Deprave&quot; Cronenberg.<br />Tim Lucas is known for his reviewing of outre films, many of which spill over into horror, and is also the author of a surreal novel, Throat Sprockets.  Robin Wood is a distinguised British film critic who is a Hitchcock expert, among other things.  The other critics in the book provide interesting insight into Cronenberg's films as well.<br />A great addition to the literature on Cronenberg, and a nice complement to the recently released (April 2004) deluxe DVD edition of Fast Company featuring his two powerful early films, Stereo and Crimes of the Future.<br />Interesting sidenote:  As far as I know, no book on Cronenberg has documented or described the 1987 episode he directed of the Canadian TV horror series Friday the 13th, entitled &quot;Faith Healer&quot;, which I still have taped from the series.	2004-04-30

What he does is hook you by making his characters so fleshed out, so well drawn, so real, that it's all you can do to stop--even if your wife, husband, girlfriend, or boyfriend is yelling at you because they need something immediately.<br />Hard Revolution, set in the late 50s, then the late 60s around Pelecanos' neck of the woods, Washington DC, seamlessly fuses a tale of social issues, day to day life of the working class, and hard crime.  It does this by focusing on, as noted, the characters.  Pelecanos does this a whole lot better than a slew of other writers working today.  It's the characters that drive the situations they're in--whether they create the situations, or are forced into them, or stumble upon them.<br />Derek and Dennis Strange, brothers, are anything but two peas in a pod.  The sons of a solid black working class couple, they live their lives the way they see fit.  Dennis drifts--by the time the main action gets underway--1968--he's a VietNam vet and is directionless.  This prompts him to move in drug circles, with those a lot nastier and more violent than he is.  After getting caught by the proprietor of the store he tried to steal from when a kid, Derek gets his life straight and becomes one of the first black cops on the DC force.<br />No Pelecanos novel would exist without Greek characters and they're here too.  But more than that are three lowlife white guys (Buzz and Dominic are two of the names, instantly giving you a sense of the time) whose actions ignite the black-white tension that forms the crux of the novel.  Martin Luther King figures prominently here, so Pelecanos has made this far more than a crime novel--although crime itself is present, thanks to both the white and the black guys who just have to get what they want right away, whether it's the murder of an innocent black teenager, or the theft of a piece of jewelry.<br />One of the author's trademarks is definitely in evidence here as well--the music of the time.  While this can even be slightly annoying (over and over, he quotes the name of the song and of the artist who sang it, listened to by a number of characters), eventually you really sink into the feel of the street in 60s DC, the atmosphere of the time, the rhythm of day to day life.<br />And in fact it's the description of this day to day life at which Pelecanos excels, and because of which this is such a compelling read. It's not so much the minutiae that he describes, but the way the characters respond to very select details of their lives as they're lived that gives this novel its meat and flavor both.  When crime does erupt, it's sudden and violent and inevitable and intense, and at the same time it's what you KNOW will happen because it's what the character who's committed it HAS to do.<br />This is a great, immensely satisfying novel that is a solid addition to the Pelecanos canon.

This is one of Jon Jackson's first novels featuring Sergeant Mulheisen of the Detroit PD, if not the first.  The plotting here is excellent; there are a lot of threads that Jackson knows how to interweave, giving this baby momentum.  And once in a great while there's a genuinely funny line.  The characters are nicely drawn, too.  The fly in the ointment is the writing which can be occasionally clunky and awkward.  If that doesn't bother you, then this is a nifty little police procedural that, for fans of the genre, will keep you going.<br />Mulheisen, portrayed as one of the cooler heads on the force, gets drawn into a few different crime threads.  A mysterious intruder at the home of a young wealthy trucking magnate is killed by two patrolmen.  Two thugs come into a local watering hole and shoot up both the jukebox and the cigarette machine, purportedly owned by the same young trucking tycoon.  A great looking woman, a friend of the tycoon, lures Mulheisen with her sexiness and charm, and, later disappears.  And a huge gun heist, coupled with a huge crash involving a runaway train, brings things to a head.<br />Lotta stuff going on here, but Jackson pulls it all together well.  Mulheisen has to put the puzzle pieces together and does an admirable job, for sure.  It's unfortunate that the choppy writing gets in the way; otherwise, it would rate at least four stars.<br />Your call.	2004-02-15

He's a force unto himself and sorely missed.  In Dreaming of Babylon, 1977, he's gotta 40s gumshoe, C. Card, who's so broke he has to borrow a friend's gun 'cause he can't afford his own.  But the gun has no bullets so he has to find them somewhere as well.  What a guy.<br />The title refers to C's tendency to picture himself in a land of imagination that takes him far away from the everyday world into a place that rewards him with a beauteous dame (natch) and all kinds of pleasures and stuff.  With chapter titles like &quot;Mustard&quot;, &quot;A Babylonian Sand Watch&quot;, and &quot;Barcelona&quot;, it's not hard to tell C. loves fantasizing a lot, as well as moving back and forth between that and the nitty gritty stuff of life.<br />Of course every chapter is 2 or 3 pages; the largest is 6.  Here's a great little excerpt: &quot;'You've broken your mother's heart', she'd always say then and I'd answer, 'Don't say that, Mom, just because I'm a private detective. I still love you.'&quot;<br />C. has to solve a murder (of course; otherwise this wouldn't be a private eye novel) and the things that happen to him are funny and ridiculous and strange and tense and just plain dumb sometimes.  But that's life, ain't it?  He goes about his business like a goofball sometimes and sometimes he actually has enough smarts to put two and two together--when he's not off in Babylon somewhere....<br />You don't read Brautigan for a linear plot and non-whimsical writing.  You don't read him if you want characters who take themselves seriously embedded in worlds of text whose author also takes himself seriously.  You read Brautigan 'cause you know he's gotta sense of humor nobody else ever did, does, or will have.  You read him 'cause he's a guy whose heart is a whole lot bigger than a breadbox and who thinks with it really well.

That's what the whole deal is here, folks.<br />OK, the thing is that Phillips is not a dumb guy.  He knows how to move things and the reader fast and all that.  But there ain't no characters here, just caricatures.  For those of you who like your fiction on the extra-light side, here 'tis.  Me, I'll stick with Hammett, Dan Marlowe, and Vic Gischler (see Gun Monkeys) which in my humble opinion, is a much stronger take on modern noir.<br />The comic strip nature of the book is accented by the cover and interior illos which all have that kinda look.

US	49545974	R2Z9IDDOW77YCD	5557119094	375548904	A Single Shot	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Fatal accident and its aftermath	One of the great unknown literary noir novels of the last ten years, Matthew Jones' A Single Shot is  set in mountainous back country where, at its outset, John Moon, a local farmer, divorced, goes hunting.  At the same time two young drifters, male and female, are temporarily settled in around Moon's hunting grounds.  Tragedy ensues.<br />What makes this so compelling and powerful is the author's unrelenting portrait of a man who cannot stop thinking about what he has done, to the point of manic obsession, to the point of visualizing his victim appearing before him in ghostly form, and to the point of wild indetermination about what to do with the stash of cash found in the temporary nesting ground.  The revelation of criminal activity adds just the right element to this dark fever dream of a novel that pushes the reader forward, further and further into John Moon's world.<br />As we travel down this path of dread we realize that his inner world more and more becomes his outer one until the boundary between the two is blurry indeed.  As well, the intermittent involvement with his ex-wife, decidedly frustrating, is the &quot;two&quot; in a one-two punch adding to the burning emotional intensity here.<br />The author's grasp of rural speech patterns, behaviors, and lifestyle is flawless, giving the novel the authenticity it needs to make it truly masterful.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-12
US	49545974	RZ8NMUQ4A9RW0	0030103363	139268347	Dead City	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Mobbed up and vicious	One of the great unsung American writers--Stephen King freely acknowledged him as a strong influence and inspiration for his own work--Shane Stevens here gives us a brutal and effective portrait of mob guys--from soldier level to Don--that stings and howls.  Released the same year as the first of the Godfather films, Dead City is dark and wholly character-driven.  Joe Zucco, the mob chief of an undisclosed New Jersey city, bestows favors and just as easily slices up those who cross him.<br />Among those on his crew are Charley Flowers, a former hit man now demoted to muscle because of a prior botched job, and Harry Strega, a young guy who thinks he's going places after joining Zucco's mob. Zucco's rival is Alex Machine; his friends are few but loyal--or so he thinks--and his crew does everything he wants them to.  His mistress does as well.<br />Stevens knows how to put his mouth where the money is.  The sex and violence described here are intense, graphic, and powerful.  Charley and Harry have jobs to do and they do them well.  At the end, in fact, they do them too well.  Along the way, Zucco, Machine, Zucco's friend Julie K, Pete Montana (Zucco's second in command) and Gino Agucci (his bodyguard) all play parts in this gripping melodrama.<br />Some may gripe of stereotypes here.  Not true.  Why not?  Because Stevens is too good a writer to make us really feel any of his characters could ever be stereotypes.  A sample passage--in which the author is describing Harry Strega falling asleep: \\"Softly came the darkness stealing behind the eyes, sealing off the consciousness, until all that remained of him was the slender breath of life.\\"<br />Purple prose?  Not on your life.  This lets us know how tenuous a mob soldier's life really is.  You do a job one day, you get paid, the next day--who knows?<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-05

He has a girlfriend, Kelly, who adores him, and also a lover, Eve, his boss' wife, who gets off on playing rough in the sack.<br />Phil, Jimmy's boss, never catches on that Jimmy's diddling his wife.  He's too busy being an inflated ego of a boss and hitting on Kelly.  Eve, one mean femme fatale, tells Jimmy she needs Phil's money.  And there's only one way to get it...<br />Complicating matters is Phil's brother Nigel, an ex-con who's learned a lot of stuff from the law books while incarcerated in Folsom Prison--so much, in fact, that he knows exactly how to put the squeeze on Jimmy and Eve.<br />What makes this a whole lot of cuts above the standard, run-of-the-mill noir novel is Harrington's sharper than a barber's razor writing, and his relentless probing of Jimmy's psychology.  Identifying with a murderous loser like Jimmy, in the hands of a less talented writer, would be a tough job.  But Harrington is smart enough to give us the stuff that Jimmy's dreams are made of. This is what keeps us going, long past the thud of the first body Jimmy wipes off the face of the earth.<br />This is a stinging punch of a noir novel, just perfect for those who like their noir nasty and gripping.  Give it a go if you like 'em like this....	2003-12-28

Dorothy Hughes, the author, has to be classed as one of the best of the breed, based on this novel alone--although two of her other works, The Fallen Sparrow and In a Lonely Place, were also made into film noirs.<br />The real pleasure here is the crackling dialogue that lashes back and forth between Sailor (basis for Barry Gifford's character's name in Wild at Heart?), a down at the heels drifter, and the Sen--short for Senator Willis Douglass, a corrupt sleaze who had his wife killed so he could be with his floozy of a mistress.<br />Both meet up in Mexico where Sailor has tracked the Sen to get the rest of the dough Douglass promised him for keeping his mouth shut about what happened.  But also there is Mac, a Chicago cop hot on the trail of one or maybe both of the two men.<br />If you want a strong, gripping read that creates a tense world dripping with 40s atmosphere, look no further.  Noir fiends, like me, should rejoice that Canongate Crime has reissued this title in a very nice trade paperback.  Just the ticket for the holidays!	2003-12-12

Let's say instead, especially when he's a professional killer.  Charlie Swift is loyal to his boss, Stan, his mother, and his younger brother Danny and, as well, to his taxidermist girlfriend Marcie who also happens to be the widow of a guy Charlie had to put on ice.<br />Seems like Charlie's boss goes missing.  Seems like other guys in Charlie's crew are getting wasted, as in permanently.  Seems like another guy, Beggar Johnson, wants to take over Stan's turf. Charlie manages to miss getting wiped out himself and goes after the guys who killed his compadre Bob.  He's got friends--Lou the New Guy and Jimmy the Fix principally.  And he's got his wits.  Which are pretty sharp judging by the story here.<br />OK, here's some sacrilege.  Gischler claims to have read a lot of John McDonald and been heavily influenced by him, but for my money, he writes better than McDonald who in my opinion a lot of the time is hard to get through--clunky prose that's dated now. But VG's writing is smooth as silk and tough as shoe leather with powder burns.<br />Nice job.	2003-09-17

On one hand the novel has a start that could be off-putting to a lot of readers; the author wants to make sure the reader knows his main character's a stuffed shirt prig--fussy, obsessive, self-conscious to the max.  And he nearly keelhauls the book with insuring this right off the bat with all manner of much-too-detailed writing, as though both the author and the main character are looking over their shoulders every 35 seconds...<br />BUT--<br />Once the concept of the book is revealed, the book changes dramatically and becomes a really entertaining read.  OK, you're asking, so what's the concept?  What's this all about anyway?<br />Our fussy hero is a lower court judge who tries those caught committing transit authority violations--jumping turnstiles and the like.  He's also ultra-conservative.  (Note: for anyone liberal out there, don't be put off by the obvious political conservatism shown at the beginning of the book either.  It gets MUCH better).  Seems there's an ultra-liberal attorney, one Richard Raskin, a guy in his early 70s, who's really well known and who arouses the ire of this judge and many other conservatives for his seemingly irrational defense of obvious criminals, citing the standard arguments of the inability of society to find a place for these individuals in the mainstream, etc.<br />Our hero's conservatism itself arouses the wrath of a few liberals, among which is a manbo--a Haitian voudun (voodoo) priestess. When the judge refuses to retract a derogatory statement about Raskin, the manbo--the two meet in a bar--puts a curse on the judge.  Raskin has just suffered a massive coronary and soon after, dies.<br />And what is the curse?<br />Well...I don't want to stick a spoiler in here.  On the other hand, it's so outrageous, so radical, that I kind of have to.  Richard is, shall we say, reborn.<br />How?<br />As part of the judge.<br />What part?<br />The part that has two functions.  And no, I don't mean the mouth.  (Mouth--eat, talk).  What other part of the MALE anatomy has two functions?  (HINT:  in the performance of both functions, something liquid is expelled).<br />Yep. You got it.<br />What makes this so immensely entertaining, once we get going with the re-appearance of Richard, is that he's a very bright guy--smarter in several ways than the judge.  Especially when it comes to handling women.  Our hero learns quite a bit from, er, Dick, and that's not even the half of it.  So to speak.<br />Richard has tiny little eyes and ears and you can probably figure out what his mouth is.  Most of all he has a brain.  And he talks.  (Hence the title).<br />There are huge chunks of very effective humor once we really get going here, laugh out loud stuff.  If you can slog past the first 20 or 30 pages, do it, because the good stuff after that is REALLY good.<br />If it were not for the first section, I would easily give this four stars.

In fact this reads like it could have been written two weeks ago, not over 25 years ago: a contemporary crime novel from the criminal's perspective with enough emphasis on psychology to keep the reader hooked straight through to the end.<br />The key phrase here is, &quot;He who lives by the gun, dies by the gun.&quot;  Prophetic words for the protagonist, Nicholas &quot;Colley&quot; Donato, a criminal whose expertise is the heist.  McBain puts Colley through a whole set of stuff including successful jobs, a violent partner, and an equally violent woman who lusts and murders more intensely than any man in the story--and of course the knockout ending at a small town gun shop.<br />This is hardboiled crime writing at its finest, and very highly recommended.	2003-07-13

Dag nabbit, they just go together like spittle on a backy-chewin geezer's whiskers.  Woodrell is somethin' fresh and mean and lonesome and true in the land of the hardboiled.  He takes you down a crick with Doyle Redmond, his protagonist, all cozied up with 19-year old Niagra, the daughter of Doyle's big brother Smoke, and when them two drift down that flowing water, heat just naturally gets turned up.  Cause Niagra has flames lickin' up her legs--her sexy red boots--and Doyle's first look at 'em does him in.  He's hooked.<br />Smoke's woman, Big Annie, cottons to Doyle in a sisterly/motherly way since he's her beau's brother and also after her daughter.  The four of them harvest their dope (i.e., marijuana) cash crop which a pack of nasties, the Dollys, try to weasel in on.  Take over, in fact.  And, yes, it is a backwoods legendary feudin' thing--the Redmonds vs. the Dollys.  The noir-ness of the book is not just this feud; it's Doyle's and Smoke's tendencies to feel things in the extreme.<br />This is a great read cause Woodrell is a mighty fine writer.  He knows how to sling the right words, blend them smooth as you please in an eminently readable way.  Most entertaining.  A genuine pleasure, if you ask me.<br />Pick it up and have a dang good time.	2003-04-26

Is this pulp?  Yeah, you bet--the best pulp around.  Written in the 50s, it holds up really well because there's no wasted words; Marlowe doesn't spend time showing off like the almighty Raymond does.  He just gets right down to business immediately--the novel starts off with a bank robbery and then keeps its toughness straight through to the end.<br />When one of your crew gets whacked you check it out.  That's what drives the book and it's a great driver, pushing and pulling through the guys and dames who make things sexy, ugly, interesting, or just plain crazy til the very end.<br />Great book for all hardboiled fans.

Basis for two films--Nicholas Ray's 1948 They Live By Night and Robert Altman's 1974 film of the same name--it tells of working class joes during the Depression who make a living by robbing banks, talking about it as white-collar slobs would a day at the office.  Only with a lot more slang, spice, and color.<br />The writing is brisk, fresh, and succinct.  Anderson is great at capturing the feel of the time, through the terrific dialogue and his clean punchy prose.  Thieves Like Us is a real joy to read because it's a no BS book; you can really feel the characters when you're reading it like they were right next to you.<br />That violence is a natural part of that life goes without saying. The violence portrayed is done so without gore or sensationalism--it's beautifully integrated into the story, adding that much more to the power and resonance of this work.<br />Who should read this?  Those who want to know where hardboiled came from.  Those who want a strong sense of American literature--i.e., what America contributed to world literature.  Those who are students of the Depression, adding to their understanding of that period. And those who love a great story.<br />A true classic.  Don't miss!	2003-04-13

Jackie Dippolito--Dip--is a loyal soldier in Tony Montello's crew whose life changes when he takes a bullet for Tony's son Jimmy.  The bullet doesn't do much damage (at least not externally), but Dip finds himself Jimmy's tutor, at odds with his girlfriend Robin, and maybe even suspect for some hits that have taken place.  Naturally there's a rival crew--Joey Cara's--and they got stuff to take care of, just like Tony's guys do.<br />This is a fast read; Cirni knows his lingo and does a solid job of moving the plot along, propelled by characters like Trick, Prize, Diesel, Eva (Tony's new wife), as well as the aforementioned Tony, Joey, Jimmy, and Dip.  Throw in another guy named Sonny who loves Asian chicks, a rat named Hack, and...yeah, well, you get the picture.<br />Wanna have some fun? Read this.	2003-03-18

It was Serge who squeezed the money of Dr. Tooth in the first place and now he wants his bucks. But they're not where Serge thinks they are.  So he goes after the money.<br />That's more or less the plot, but you have to realize that this Dorsey guy has read a couple of Toms--Robbins and Sharpe--as well as THE greatest Floridian crime novelist, Charles Willeford, and mixed these three guys together along with his own totally insane manic energy and concocted a snazzy, white hot laugh out loud crime novel that does not disappoint those of us who love hardboiled stuff.<br />If you want to laugh like a hyena and get punched in the face with some bloody good fun, here is a great book to do it with.

This is a gripping read for sure; Kelly does know how to make you keep turning pages.<br />Officer Ray Dolan lives just down the way from the Travises, a very wealthy couple--Lance and Sheila--and their teenage daughter Brie.  Dolan, single, has ambivalence about his job, possibly stemming from his father, also a cop, having committed suicide.  But he gets along well with his fellow officers, especially Frank Kaiser, who, after many years of marriage, finds his wife having an affair.  Also on the scene is Leanne Corvino, a local TV news anchor.<br />Dolan and Corvino hook up briefly, but after catching sight of his sexy neighbor, Sheila Travis, Dolan forgets about Corvino and develops serious hots for Sheila.  Needless to say, complications ensue.  Turns out Sheila's husband has questionable morals. Turns out Sheila is not happy with Lance.  Turns out Sheila and Ray (Dolan) get something going.<br />It also turns out that Sheila, Lance, Frank, Ray, and Leanne all have stuff going on involving each other that does not seem apparent initially and that definitely makes for noir-themed fiction at its best.<br />This is a great read for those who like their noir juicy and involving.

Dennis Pike, 34 and already going gray, is called on by two of his former cronies in crime, the Bishop brothers, for a new heist--of their former gangmate who's now made it big.  Dennis is not too keen on this--as they say--'cause now he's gone straight.  But a mysterious disappearance of his bank account forces him to go along with the plan.<br />The three of them do not count on Terry Nugent, resident nutjob who's about as violent as they come, gumming up the works.  There's also Marti, Dennis' former girlfriend who's taken up with Patterson, another former gangmate, and Herman the German, the computer whiz.  And of course the amazingly disgusting Mr. Bishop, father to the two brothers.<br />The slang comes fast and furious here but even for those of us Yanks who're not familiar with it, the context is there to help us out.

The tale is of Phil Lansdale, former lawyer now disbarred, who finds out his married neighbor, Cassandra Payne, is one swell looking babe and pursues his need to scratch that itch in spite of a wife who digs him a lot.<br />Phil starts drinking and doing stuff he never did before. He gets buddy-buddy with another neighbor, a retired cop, who thinks Cassandra may have done something pretty nasty. Of course this doesn't stop Phil from letting his pants go where his head shouldn't.<br />As Phil gets more and more involved in finding out who Cassandra is and what she may have done, things get worse and worse.

You know d**n well this is gonna be a rough ride when the story opens with a description of Lamar as having biggest organ of any white guy in his prison. Set in the Oklahoma-Texas region, it pulls no punches as it tells of the vicious, violent and voracious Lamar Pye and his idiot cousin Odell who, along with pansy genius Richard Peed--saved from prison gang-banging by Lamar because of Richard's amazing artistic talent--escape from the pen and stage a Denny's holdup, a raid on an old farmer's homestead, and an astounding, suspense-filled wrap up that does not disappoint.<br />It also tells of Bud Pewtie, a seasoned, 48-year old Oklahoma State Trooper who goes after Lamar relentlessly, and Bud's family troubles.  Lamar himself yearns for a family and picks up Ruta Beth Tull, a scrawny, half-deranged woman with a horrific crime in her past.  She latches onto Lamar like a flea on a big dog and lets him enjoy her whenever he wants.<br />This ain't no cozy mystery--not by a long shot. Those of you who long for Agatha Christie, pack up your bags and head out 'cause this is so far removed from little old ladies and genteel polite tea-sipping ninnies and nannies, it'll curl your hair and then some to read it if that's what you need in your life.<br />Hunter's done his homework.  He knows guns inside out, backwards and forwards, up and down.  Guns figure large here; it's what Bud knows better than anything else, and what Lamar needs to do his dirty work.  Guns not only kill people here; their wielders kill hope for a good life in this rock hard piece of writing.  Dirty White Boys is a more than fitting title for a tale of low class lowlifes who steal and kill because that's what they know, and of lawmen who have to descend just as low because that's what they expect to encounter in their work.<br />And it is true--once started, this is really, really difficult to stop reading.  Don't take my word for it.  Start reading and see what happens., really difficult to stop reading.  Don't take my word for it.  Start reading and see what happens.	2002-07-27

The words are hard as nails--occasionally dipped in acid and that makes this all the more what it's spozed to be.<br />Take a con who's Ivy League educated and has warped aspirations of making himself as corrupt as possible.  Yeah, do that, and at the same time, let him keep his three-dollar words to throw in when he feels like it, when he wants to prove--to himself, mostly--that he's a hell of a lot more educated than the guys he 'admires': Alvin Karpis, Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger.  It's a potent mix, and McCoy does it up just right.  The language is not stupid; it's perfect, reflecting the main character (Ralph Cotter)'s twisted psyche.  Everything's from his point of view.<br />You got your shysters, your corrupt cops, your wicked women.  Oh yeah, you got 'em, all right, but when they're in the picture, the dialogue snaps like a wet Coney Island towel wielded by a wiseguy.<br />You wanna good read that reminds you of American knowhow--as in I know how to push your buttons, buddy?  I know how to give you a story that tells you about the things Americans think about, but don't talk about.<br />This is it.  This is an egg whose shell you can't break.  That's how hardboiled this is.	2002-06-24

Though published in 1966, it has a strong '50s feel that comes through in the language and the cultural references both.<br />Himes' dialogue and language can be occasionally stilted, but there are chase scenes here that will make you sit up and take notice, and the focus on black-white relations is especially good.  It's the story of a white cop who accidentally on purpose shoots to death two black 'porters' (workers who unload trucks for a restaurant) and then goes after a third, Jimmy, who manages to survive the cop's onslaught.<br />The depiction of the cop as sometimes conflicted by his actions is well done and his liaison with Jimmy's black girlfriend is strong stuff indeed.  There's a somewhat uneasy mix here, though, of academic and street thinking.  Jimmy is studying at Columbia University and shows it in his speech, but when other characters speak, it sometimes sounds like they're struggling to catch up to Jimmy's psychology and often it doesn't feel right.<br />Nevertheless, what makes this compelling is, as mentioned, the focus on race relations and racism, the chase scenes, and the cop's wacked psychology.<br />An interesting read.	2002-05-08

The Big Book of Noir, co-edited by Lee Server and Ed Gorman, is chock full of terrific pieces on great directors and writers including Cornell Woolrich, A.I. Bezzerides (writer of the classics Kiss Me Deadly, On Dangerous Ground, and Thieves' Highway), Harry Whittington, Peter Rabe, Fritz Lang, Leigh Brackett, Gil Brewer, Mickey Spillane, and many more.<br />One of the best things about the book is that several of the above-mentioned pieces are actually interviews; Lang and Bezzerides fall into this category, as do Daniel Mainwaring (writer of Out of the Past), Abraham Polonsky (writer of Force of Evil), Peter Rabe, Charles Willeford, and Donald Westlake.<br />Several of the non-interview pieces are written by some of the best known writers in suspense fiction around including Stephen King (on Jim Thompson), William Nolan, Ed Gorman, Barry Malzberg, Bill Pronzini, and Max Allan Collins.  Other pieces are firsthand accounts--by Leigh Brackett and Malvin Wald (writer of Naked City).<br />There's an interesting checklist of 100 favorite noir films (including a few by Jean-Pierre Melville, one of the all-time great French directors--a powerful inspiration for Tarantino), another checklist of 100 noir novels, and even a section on noir comics!<br />The Radio and TV section goes into Peter Gunn, of course, but also mentions the lesser-known (and by all accounts, far more interesting) Johnny Staccato which starred John Cassevetes who was infinitely edgier than Craig Stevens' Gunn character.<br />These guys have done their homework and more, and it definitely shows.  It's a shame this book is out of print; it's terrific!	2002-05-02

For example, you wouldn't usually call Island of Lost Souls, 1933 with Charles Laughton, film noir, but Gifford here is driving home his perspective which deals with the dark side of the cinema--those films that deal with corruption and desperation in all their manifestations.<br />Probably the most valuable aspect of this book is that you find out something about films that very few other reviewers write about.  The original title of this book (this is a revised version, published in 2000) was called The Devil Thumbs a Ride and Gifford here supplies some pretty trenchant comments about that film (with one of the most evil characters in film noir ever, done up right by ultra tough guy Lawrence Tierney) and other obscure yet important works in the genre.<br />Cul-de-Sac by Polanski is included--hard to find, but definitely one of the director's better films.  The Mean Season (which I found weak) is included.  Shack Out on 101 (has anyone actually seen this film?) is included.  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  You get the idea.<br />Gifford obviously does not confine himself to suspense/mystery, but embraces films in all genres and lets fly with some strong opinions about all of them.  You may not agree with everything he says (I sure don't!) but what he has to say is intriguing and definitely worth a look.	2002-04-29

Starr's characters in their desperate situations will start gnawing at you and before you know it, you'll be snagged but good.  The characters in here have everyday problems and they take drastic measures to try getting out of them. This is noir, and it is great noir.<br />There are two guys with desperate situations. Number one: what am I gonna do about my 10-years-younger-than-me mistress who's threatening to blab to my wife unless I tell the mistress I love her? And the other guy--what am I gonna do about the nine grand<br />I owe the bookies and the loan shark? Kidnapping and a whole lot of even nastier stuff happen here. It ain't pretty, but it ain't spozed to be. This is noir.<br />Yeah, this is the real stuff. Check it out.	2002-04-14
