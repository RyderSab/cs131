I already knew a lot about the topic, being a fan of Richard Dawkins and Stephen Pinker. But it was filled with great descriptions of fascinating lab work, which really pulled me in.<br /><br />Now if you're not a fan of Dawkins or Pinker, it's probably for religious or political reasons; and I'd say to you: don't worry about this book. The subject matter was familiar to me because of those authors, but Marcus has none of their ideological verve. There's not even any philosophy. He didn't beat the nature/nurture horse: with this close of a look, it's just unnecessary. This is just about genes and brains; that's all.<br /><br />So, if you're looking at this book, here are some others that I like that I think you might want to consider:<br /><br />Richard Flanagan, The Problem of the Soul<br /><br />Stephen Pinker, How the Mind Works<br /><br />Matt Ridley, The Red Queen<br /><br />Matt Ridley, Genome	2005-08-13

Books	1	39	56	N	N	cannot share the enthusiasm	If you go in for Neale Donald Walsch and Deepak Chopra, this will be up your alley.<br /><br />The author assumes that her audience is in need only of affirmation, no matter what spiritual traditions have to be butchered to deliver it. As long as it feels good, nevermind what is actually true.<br /><br />Well, I can't take it. I had written a long critical review, but it comes down to this: this book is generally trite and superficial.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't all bad, but why lay down 22 American dollars for it when there are much, much better books waiting unread to enrich you?<br /><br />Let me give some recommendations of good books about spirituality that won't numb your brain:<br /><br />1. David Cortesi's \\"Secular Wholeness\\"<br /><br />2. \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism\\"<br /><br />3. Olivier Clement's \\"The Roots of Christian Mysticism\\"<br /><br />4. Stephen Huyler's \\"Meeting God: The Elements of Hindu Devotion\\"<br /><br />5. Ursula Goodenough's \\"The Sacred Depths of Nature\\"<br /><br />6. Kahlil Gibran's \\"The Prophet\\"<br /><br />7. Sharon Salzberg's \\"Lovingkindness\\"<br /><br />8. James Thornton's \\"Field Guide to the Soul\\"<br /><br />Something there will warm your heart, or turn your world upside down.<br /><br />It comes with a CD, which was fair. But again there's great music out there: Washington Phillips, The Golden Gate Quartet, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Vas, Alabama Sacred Harp, Mary Youngblood, Byzantine chant, Russian Orthodox chant, Gregorian chant, or the Music of Islam series. More than the recordings that come with this book, I guarantee that something there will blow your boat off the dock.<br /><br />I hope this review enables people to find something more edifying and truthful than they would've found otherwise.	2005-08-12

However, I really did learn a lot about the archaeology of Korea while I read it.<br /><br />I guess due to the nature of the evidence, pottery was covered in special depth, and other kinds of artifacts were related to the pottery. I especially appreciated the cautious speculations about religion in stone-age and bronze-age Korea; that's why I read the book. Now, when I visit a museum here in Korea, even if I can't understand the labels, I know what I'm looking at pretty well: that's another big bonus for me.<br /><br />It's a few years old now. I think that genetic work probably sheds some light on the migrations into the peninsula, and there must've been a lot of archaeological research since this book has been written. Soon, I hope, North Korea will open up a bit and more research will go on there; the sites there are probably very interesting. I hope a more updated version comes out sometime soon.<br /><br />The bibliography was also very helpful to me.<br /><br />I have no idea what a well-informed scholar would make of this book, however; and when I read reviews by people who don't know about things that I know about, I can tell...<br /><br />UPDATE: I've now discovered Gina L. Barnes' \\"The Rise of Civilization in East Asia: The Archaeology of China, Korea and Japan.\\" I highly recommend it. It's easier to read, somehow inherently more interesting, and the regional coverage adds a lot of useful context. It spans a greater time period with less detail, but its fascinating insights really do make up for the loss of detail. Unless for some reason you are definitely interested in Nelson's book, I recommend Barnes.	2005-08-11

The philosophy isn't watered down too much, and fortunately (thanks no doubt to Chad Hansen's contribution) it's not mixed in with unrelated stuff from the Upanishads or anything like that.<br /><br />There is a misprint on the back, \\"ying-yang\\" which must be slang for the padding surrounding one's gluteus maximus; inside the book the spelling is correct. The explanation of yin-yang is also correct and simple.<br /><br />I would've wanted a lot more information on religious Taoism: information about modern movements and so on. Which deities are most commonly worshipped in Taiwan, which in Hong Kong, which in Beijing? And, how are they worshipped? I'd like information about Taoist pilgrimages, Taoist sacred places, and so on. The book doesn't touch any of that: minus one star.<br /><br />Also, the bit on quantum physics could be greatly, greatly improved. Maybe they could've asked a few grad students at a physics dep't for commentary? It would have greatly helped: minus one star.<br /><br />However, I just couldn't give the book 3 stars; the chapters on politics and ecology were surprisingly good, the internet links are too helpful, and as I said earlier the explanation of ancient Chinese philosophy was too good. So, maybe there's a little grade inflation here.<br /><br />In sum, it's a good introduction to Taoism, and it'll prepare you to move on to deeper stuff, and help you find it.<br /><br />If, like, you're already a Taoist immortal or something, this book isn't for you, and you can't really criticize it for that. I'd expect you to realize that already.	2005-08-11

So I was pretty familiar with the material in this book even before I read it. The reason I read it anyway was because Rees discusses some of my favorite speculations: Andrei Linde's inflationary multiverse theory and Lee Smolin's theory of fecund universes. I am in no position to evaluate those theories, but I just have an old-fashioned hunch that Linde's theory must be true, while Smolin's is merely possible. But I like them both, and I hope they're both true. So I read whatever I can on them.<br /><br />What I got out of it that I didn't expect was a deeper respect for Chandrasekhar and Hoyle. Otherwise, I got what I wanted.<br /><br />Now, if you don't read about cosmology or physics much, I honestly wouldn't recommend this book. John Barrow is on the cover saying it'd be a good first book, but I firmly disagree.<br /><br />Ahead of it, I'd recommend Ferris' \\"The Whole Shebang,\\" which, until something better is written, is the best cosmology book available: the best thing since Sagan's \\"Cosmos,\\" in fact. Don't ask me why it isn't more widely appreciated. It has a wider scope than this book, it goes into greater depth on every point (so it's longer), it's better-written, and its explanations are clearer. Rees' book is a little hard to get into because some of his writing is simply wooden, and he often doesn't trouble himself to explain things very carefully, however.<br /><br />BUT - it's not that bad really; it just compares unfavorably to Ferris' book, which I strongly urge you to read before this one.<br /><br />Or just hang on awhile; within a few years something better has got to come out because neither of these books, nor any book that I know of, provides a good introduction to cosmology that includes recent work on the large-scale structure of the universe and the recent, cosmos-shaking discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Here's a major gap in the pop-sci literature, and it's bound to be filled soon.<br /><br />If you want to read something by Rees, I suggest checking out \\"Our Final Hour,\\" his more recent, and more provocative book.verse is accelerating.

It says, \\"The testimonies in these pages were uttered by leaders of diverse denominations and religious, even atheists, who gathered at special seminars in Heaven to study the the truth of God...\\" (page 5).<br /><br />And, \\"While in the Spirit, [Dr. Young Soon Kim] was able to hear ... interviews with the people at the seminars and record them on paper for earthly people to read\\" (page 6).<br /><br />On pages 8-9 is a letter from God. It is dated December 28, 2001, and here are some excerpts:<br /><br />\\"Dear beloved True Parents,<br /><br />\\"I am God, the Creator of the universe and the God of all humankind....<br /><br />\\"On December 25, 2001, the founders and leading figures of Christianity and the other major religions adopted a written resolution in which they all without exception resolved to participate in My providence for the peaceful unification of the cosmos....<br /><br />\\"Sincerely,<br />\\"The God of All Humankind.\\"<br /><br />And on page 10, the messages start. First is \\"Jesus' Message to Christians and All People on Earth.\\" Jesus tells us that \\"Reverend Sun Myung Moon is the returning Messiah for whom you have been waiting and waiting.\\" His letter is dated April 5, 2001. On page 14 begins \\"The Buddha's Message to Buddhists and Believers in Other Religions.\\" He tells us, \\"In this age Reverend Sun Myung Moon is the Buddha for whom you have been waiting. ... Do not reject the new Buddha, hwo is to come in the Completed Testament Age.\\" His letter was April 6.<br /><br />Confucius' letter is next, in which he assures us, \\"During our seminars, God frequently demonstrated His thoughtfulness.\\" Mohammed tells us that \\"Reverend Sun Myung Moon came to the Earth in order to deliver God's will and to unite a divided and scattered humankind.\\"<br /><br />Socrates is next, telling us, \\"Reverend Sun Myung Moon, on behalf of God, is guiding us toward an eternal passage to peace.\\"<br /><br />Now, guess who? Karl Marx! (Other famous religious leaders, such as Moses, Lao-Tze, or Zoroaster, didn't make statements.) He announces that, \\"I, Marx, have met God. ... He is the Parent of humankind. Reverend Sun Myung Moon, who is on the Earth, brought this fact to light.\\"<br /><br />Engels and Lenin get their turn, and then it is Stalin's turn, and he confesses that he is in hell. \\"I can't stand this pain. ... We live in the bottom of hell here. ... Reverend Moon reflects the image of God, even though he is a man, and he is struggling intensely to save the Communist countries. ... Friends, please save me. Please liberate me. When your way of life changes according to the teaching of Godism, I will be liberated in the spirit world. ... My heart longs for release from Hell.\\"<br /><br />Next, Trotsky, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Mao, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaopeng, Erich Honecker, Ceaucescu, Ho Chi-Minh, Pol Pot, and Che all give their post-mortem renunciation of communism in favor of the Unification Church. After that are 12 famous dead journalists.<br /><br />Now, on page 59, is another letter from God.<br /><br />\\"My beloved Children!<br /><br />\\"I am Jehovah, Lord of hosts....<br /><br />\\"Imagine how I must have felt as I watched brothers and sisters live separated from each other, hating each other, fighting and killing each other with swords, guns, missiles and brute force...<br /><br />\\"I have specially sent Rev.

I earnestly ask that the people of America follow the guidance of True Parents absolutely.\\"<br /><br />Millard Fillmore says, \\"The citizens of America must come to a clear understanding as to the identity of Rev.

It's intelligent thinking about life, with a practical emphasis: how to enjoy your life and live well. It's quite thoughtful and original, yet not systematic at all, usually overconfident (kind of forcedly profound), and occasionally even ridiculous. But always relevant and stimulating.<br /><br />It's more thinking about time, or our experience of time, than you'd think is possible, unless you'd bothered to fight through Heidegger.<br /><br />The value of the book is its creative thought about life. This book will make you think about your life. If you're thoughtful, you'll disagree with some of the author's opinions, but there's some gold in here. I give it five stars for stimulating valuable thoughts, five stars for content (despite some flaws), and five stars for the genre: we need more intelligent, thoughtful books about living well.	2005-08-01

They don't exist, and they don't make sense. If you think they do, you're not what you think you are.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, that's ok. Naturalism's version of the self and agency are enough for a fulfilling worldview. He throws on an argument about ethics, but it's really an afterthought, kind of an appendix to his work on the self and agency.<br /><br />If you are looking for an argument about religion, this isn't it. His purpose is not to satisfy the religiously devoted that they can give up their faith, but the folks who are hesitant to give up &#34;the soul&#34; or &#34;free will.&#34;<br /><br />Flanagan doesn't take any theistic position very seriously. He's not interested in refuting theism except when he &#34;has to&#34; to get on with his real interests. &#34;There is no point beating around the bush. Supernatural concepts have no philosophical warrant.&#34;<br /><br />If you want to argue that point, you want a book defending scientific naturalism against theistic critics (actually, usually the relationship is reversed these days), and you'll have to look elsewhere. This just isn't it and you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />And he isn't even interested in &#34;qualia,&#34; although in his bibliography he admits that it's the &#34;sexiest&#34; topic in philosophy of mind. But I personally think that there's nothing there to get excited about. So I didn't mind the omission.<br /><br />But if you want a book on qualia look elsewhere. (Try Dennett.) This just isn't it and you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />He is really only interested in whether a naturalist account of the self and agency will allow us to conceive of ourselves as having meaningful lives. I am in basic agreement with him, so I won't criticize his answer.<br /><br />Among his critics here on Amazon, the popular science journalist John Horgan disagrees with Flanagan in his review without giving any reason; Horgan thinks science leaves no room for meaningful human choice. A strong, extreme position; no doubt it would be a long discussion. Folks who take Horgan's position have a lot to prove. Even Daniel Dennet, not one to shy away from &#34;uncomfortable&#34; aspects of scientific materialism, basically agrees with Flanagan.<br /><br />Actually, I think Horgan just missed the point of the chapters on selfhood. Otherwise, he'd probably phrase his objection differently.<br /><br />Anyway, ethics as ecology is not to be taken too literally, it's more of a suggestion than a philosophical system, and Flanagan doesn't take it very far. If you want a deep look at ethics from a naturalist perspective, look elsewhere. Flanagan recommends Allan Gibbard or Simon Blackburn; others might recommend Mackie.<br /><br />One critic was misled by Flanagan's use of the word &#34;humanist.&#34; He doesn't mean secular humanism, he means the classical tradition of thought from ancient times through Descartes and right up until scientific materialism. It must have been a very confusing book for that guy. Someone might be confused by Flanagan's use of &#34;libertarian&#34; as well, which has nothing to do with politics.<br /><br />Motsinger's impatient review brought out a couple of relevant points, such as whether Flanagan did a &#34;bait and switch.&#34;<br /><br />Actually, maybe so, but not in the chapters Motsinger obsesses over--rather, in the chapters on &#34;self.&#34; Flanagan redefines &#34;self&#34; so that our &#34;selves&#34; have (some) meaningful power of choice. He spends two chapters on that project because it is the real key to his argument: once self is re-defined along Flanagan's lines, everything else follows naturally.<br /><br />Flanagan himself says, &#34;My proposal is this: Change the subject. Stop talking about free will and determinism and talk instead about whether and how we can make sense [in a worldview of scientific naturalism] of the concepts of 'deliberation,' 'choice,' 'reasoning,' 'agency,' and 'accountability.'&#34;<br /><br />What he does is change the &#34;self&#34; under discussion to make sense of those topics. He succeeds.<br /><br />Well, and that's the key point. You're not what you think you are, but it's ok. You can go on with your life. You still have all the ethical equipment you need and want. He'll show you why, if you want to know. I think he's right, I think most of his discussion is relevant and reasonable: 5 stars.<br /><br />Some reading I'd recommend before hitting Flanagan is Steven Pinker, especially &#34;How the Mind Works.&#34; Perhaps one of Damasio's books would be ok, but I prefer Pinker. In fact, if you're not a little familiar with social psychology and cognitive science, I doubt you'll appreciate this book.<br /><br />(There's the touche for the pure philosophers out there: this is a book about the real world.)t he does is change the &#34;self&#34; under discussion to make sense of those topics.

So if that's what you're after, this is your book. If you're going to study it thoroughly and carefully, I recommend keeping a good Bible handy, especially the Oxford Bible, which is the best for scholarly (non-denominational, non-devotional, non-theological) study.<br /><br />If you are reading the Bible simply for scholarly or literary purposes, a book like this is great.<br /><br />I recommend following this one up with a book like \\"The Bible Unearthed\\" by Finkelstein and Silberman, which deals with  archaeology rather than textual investigation; and I strongly recommend reading a couple books by Hershel Shanks. After just this short reading list, you'll be able to digest even the most scholarly work on the Hebrew Bible, by folks like Mark Smith.<br /><br />But if you are looking for help reading the Bible as an element of your religious devotion, this book is probably not what you're looking for. Basically, modern scholars try to discover what the texts meant when they were written, rather than what they might mean to us. That takes a lot of irreverent detective work, and believers are usually uncomfortable, often defensive, when they encounter critical scholarship.<br /><br />HOWEVER - this is a big one - I honestly believe that the Biblical texts get much richer when critical scholarship is coupled with traditional and modern interpretations. The first chapters of Genesis provide a great example. Modern scholarship offers a lot of insight into what those stories (might have) meant to their original writers and audiences, and what they meant to later editors as well. We discover the spirituality of the ancients that has been hidden beneath more recent interpretations.<br /><br />Now you don't have to throw out your tradition's more recent interpretations. Although you might choose to do that, most traditions have a lot of other theological options.<br /><br />So, this is a long way of saying that if you read the Bible devotionally, then sure, modern scholarship will probably be challenging to your faith. But I encourage you not to put your head in the sand: find out what the scholars are saying. If, ultimately, you simply have to disagree and take a defensive stance, at least you'll know what you're up against. But probably, despite some struggles, you'll come to a much greater appreciation for the human authors of your scriptures, and for the depths of meaning hidden in the scriptures themselves. Not only that, but when you learn to see the scriptures from different perspectives, you'll probably learn a lot about your own tradition.modern scholarship will probably be challenging to your faith.

But if you really don't know anything about Machu Picchu, this book will give you a bare idea of it.<br /><br />My top 40 places would be different of course, and so would everyone else's. For instance, number one on my list would be Jerusalem, and number three would be Istanbul: neither got in here. Well, that's his perogative and I can't dis the book over it.<br /><br />Some selections did surprise me. For instance, Shanghai is listed, but Xian isn't. I think most people would reverse that. Of all the great places in India, of course Varanasi (my number 2) and the Taj Mahal appear, and then the Jaisalmer Fort. Well, that's a reasonable choice, but I would have strongly preferred Mumbai or Amritsar.<br /><br />Anyway, the real problem is choosing 40, rather than 80 or so. The world's a big, wonderful, interesting place after all. No mention here of the Amazon or the Congo, of Meteora or Mashhad, and so on.<br /><br />The real reason that I bought this book is to inspire my girlfriend to travel with me: I think we all have that kind of thing in mind. For that, it'll do.<br /><br />There are some other books that I'd recommend checking out before you spend your money. For instance, \\"The Spirit of Asia\\" by Michael Freeman is excellent for that part of the world; and Joe Cumming's book \\"Buddhist Stupas in Asia\\" will inspire a lot of travel throughout Asia. I own those two books, but a few others also look very good to me: \\"Sacred Places Around the World,\\" \\"100 Things to do Before You Die,\\" \\"The Travel Book,\\" and, for pure photography, books by Art Wolfe or Yann Arthus-Bertrand.<br /><br />Amid such company, I feel that this book is fine, and I don't regret buying it at all. But it's not exceptional in any regard, so I give it 4 stars. At Amazon's price ($13.50 as I write this), it is certainly a good deal, as some of the books I prefer are more expensive.book is fine, and I don't regret buying it at all.

I haven't read much about these issues, and since I really love math I enjoyed his explanation of these things.<br /><br />Also, I agree with his ultimate conclusion: that mysticism provides a way of knowing the universe, a kind of knowledge that can't be turned into thoughts or words. I agree that there will always be a mystery, a boundary to our knowledge, no matter how much our knowledge grows; and that the ultimate knowledge will be past that boundary. So I'm in broad agreement with his worldview, although for cultural reasons I'm a little more hesitant to give the name of \\"God\\" to whatever is beyond the boundary. And I agree with that it is astounding that the universe is so mathematical. Shocking even. I'm not sure how else it could be, but it seems to me to be the second biggest mystery of existence, only after why there is something rather than nothing.<br /><br />And I too wonder what mathematics is, and how it manages to be written into the universe.<br /><br />I hoped for a really good discussion of that last issue in particular, and the main reason I didn't enjoy the book is because his discussion of that issue was a disorganized, rambling mess. There is some great food for thought. But unfortunately he seems to be at the same point that I am: just wondering, with no insight in particular.<br /><br />I'm cool with math and metaphysics, and I sympathize that writing a pop metaphysics book is a tough job. But it has been done better, and more recently, especially by Timothy Ferris in \\"The Whole Shebang.\\" And that's why I recommend it over this book by Davies.<br /><br />Ferris' book is wider in scope than this book, and Davies is more eager to dabble in truly exotic ideas. (For some of those, I recommend Davies' [[ASIN:0465038514 The Last Three Minutes: Conjectures About The Ultimate Fate Of The Universe (Science Masters Series)]] If you're really bent on a book by Davies, check out that one.) Davies does raise a few more questions than Ferris, but he doesn't handle them well. On the other hand, Ferris deals with a lot more actual physics and astronomy than Davies touches in this book. But the main reason I recommend Ferris over Davies is that his discussion of the philosophical issues is more lucid and well-organized. In fact, until astronomers and physicists make some breakthroughs on dark matter and dark energy, Ferris' book will probably remain the best in the field.<br /><br />If you want something specifically on math, such as the work of Godel and Turing, my first recommendation would be Hofstadter's classic [[ASIN:0394745027 Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]] or Keith Devlin's [[ASIN:0805072543 The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible]]. As for the philosophy of math, I don't have any recommendations better than Lakoff's [[ASIN:0465037712 Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being]] or a book by Stuart Shapiro, although they will not be accessible to many curious readers.

It covers about the same material as the webpage, but in a bit more depth.<br /><br />Nevertheless, don't imagine that this is a scholar's book: with about 100 pages of text, it is just a simple introduction--but a good one, accessible to average readers.<br /><br />In the first chapter, \\"What is Pantheism?\\" Harrison explains that pantheism is a religious reverence for nature or the universe, embracing science and affirming life. He contrasts it so several other \\"isms,\\" such as atheism, panentheism, and so on.<br /><br />He writes that \\"when Pantheists refer to the Universe as their god, what they really mean is that they feel the same profound sense of awe and reverence that other believers feel towards their gods. ... Although it does not tell us anything extra about the Universe itself, it expresses the powerful emotions that Pantheists towards the universe.\\" This alludes to high scholarly discussion and criticism of atheism, but Harrison makes the discussion no more complicated than that.<br /><br />Chapters two and three sketch a history of pantheism from ancient times to the twentieth century. He finds pantheism in the Hindu Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, in Mahayana Buddhism, especially the Hua-yen and Zen traditions, in Taoism (he quotes Chuang Tzu a few times in the book), in some pre-Soctratic philosophers, in the Stoics, Epicureans and Plotinus; he finds hints of it in the Hebrew Bible and Talmud, but especially in the Kabbalah; hints again in the Koran, but especially in the Sufis (he cites Al Hallaj and Ibn Arabi); hints in the New Testament and the Gospel of Thomas, and in a few heretics such as David of Dimant and Amalric of Bena, and also in Meister Eckhart. He regards Giordano Bruno as a post-Christian pantheist, and in this category he places John Toland, Spinoza, Goethe, Schelling, Hegel, the English Romantic poets (at least for parts of their lives), the American Transcendentalists, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler. He even admits that Ernst Haeckel was a pantheist. For twentieth century pantheists, he includes Frank Lloyd Wright, Robinson Jeffers, D. H. Lawrence, and Einstein.<br /><br />The reader need not be intimidated: his discussion of these figures takes only 21 pages! Unfortunately, you will not taste the flavor of those spiritualities, but you will at least realize that pantheism is a \\"perennial heresy,\\" as Harrison cleverly put it.<br /><br />He could have included many more examples. For instance the recommended reading, in the appendix, mentioned Jakob Boehme as well. I'd love to see a book that explored these figures and movements further, from a pantheist point of view.<br /><br />Chapters four and five outline the \\"core beliefs\\" of pantheists: reverence of the universe and sacred nature. He writes, \\"All pantheists feel that the Universe is in some sense worthy of the deepest reverence.\\" Also, \\"And they accept that the Universe is in important senses a unified whole of which all individual things are interdependent parts.\\"<br /><br />I have a small objection in these chapters. One reason he considers the universe to be unified is because it is causally interconnected. But that's wrong. The horizons of our own universe (from our perspective) haven't been causally connected for billions of years. And distant galaxies are falling off the apparent edge of the universe because the space between them and us is increasing faster than the speed of light. Events that happen in our galaxy today will never effect them.<br /><br />But does it matter? I doubt it. The universe (multiverse?) is yet wonderful to behold. But we need to drop references to the interrelatedness of the cosmos: it is not an ecosystem.<br /><br />He makes a few interesting points in these chapters. For instance, he quotes the pantheist Spinoza, \\"He who loves God cannot endeavor that God should love him in return,\\" juxtaposed with Richard Dawkins saying that nature is \\"nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.\\" It's simple enough to say that those statements mean the same thing, but Harrison explores it: Dawkins' terms \\"seem as little justified as blaming a rock for not feeling compassion.\\"<br /><br />I imagine Dawkins agrees; he was describing, not blaming. But Harrison knows that this will be a sensitive point for traditional theists and fluffy New Agers; so he explains, \\"Do you expect the forest to love you back? ... Does it make you love the forest any the less?\\" I, the choir, was impressed and persuaded, but Harrison went further, getting aggressive with theism: \\"The question why God would allow pain and evil to exist is one of the most difficult of all for theists to answer. Pantheists do not have to answer it.\\"<br /><br />His discussion of human significance could be a little better, I think. \\"And although our lives have no external purpose, we can give them the noble purpose of observing and understanding and loving the universe [strangely switching to a lower-case U here] and nature, and of preserving nature on our planet, and of creating societies where all humans can have dignity and the opportunity for fulfilment.\\"<br /><br />If I anticipated a cricital audience I would try harder than that. Instead, Harrison moves on to criticize traditional monotheism's account of our significance. I think his criticism is right. But there are spiritualities and philosophies besides pantheism and monotheism. So what he really needs to do is explore pantheist accounts of human significance in greater depth, and more compellingly.<br /><br />His discussion of sacred nature also has a fatal flaw: it's too glossy. I agree that nature is beautiful to behold, but we have to admit with Tennyson that she is \\"red in tooth and claw.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins deserves to be quoted again: \\"The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands [thousands? he's underestimating! millions!] of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease. It must be so. If there is ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.\\" (\\"River of Life\\" 132-3.)<br /><br />Nature may not love us; but indeed she loves none of her creatures.<br /><br />Dening the violence of nature often includes denying the violence of human nature. But as ever, \\"Know thyself\\" means in part, \\"Face the awful truth.\\" We are cut from the same cloth as the rest of nature.<br /><br />A mature pantheist spirituality must acknowledge this explicitly, even if we choose to resist it. Whatever the results, we have to confront the beast within: its cage has a back door. A pantheism of denial is New Age kitsch, and it bites us when we're not looking.<br /><br />Naive environmentalism is an example of the danger. He quotes a \\"1990 gathering of pscyhologists at Harvard\\" declaring, \\"If the self is expanded to include the natural world, behavior leading to the destruction of this world will be experienced as self-destruction.\\"<br /><br />At best, that is wishful thinking. The Bush and Saud families might approve, but the rest of us need more realism. I'm sure those pscyhologists strengthened their self-esteem, but they will never do anything for the Black Rhino or the Mountain Gorilla until they take a more realistic view of human motivation.<br /><br />Until pantheism considers the dark side of human nature, and responds, it remains in this respect immature compared to traditional religions. This is important to me, but evidently not to Harrison.<br /><br />The sixth chapter is on ethics; with conclusions basically similar to Secular Humanism. An in-depth exploration of morality is beyond the scope of an introduction to pantheism; and it would surely divide rather than unite its audience. I'd like to see it anyway, but Harrison is too wise to put it here.<br /><br />The seventh chapter covered \\"celebration, meditation and mysticism.\\" It wasn't bad; but again I wanted more.<br /><br />Chapter Eight is on pantheist \\"controversies\\" such as whether some immaterial \\"spirit\\" exists, whether there is life after death, and so on. Clearly Harrison's sympathies (and mine) lie with the materialist skeptics, but he makes room for dualists and idealists.<br /><br />The ninth chapter is about organized pantheism, and Harrison's optimism for its future.<br /><br />There are some appendices as well: dates of the solstices and major meteor showers and so on; that information is also available on the website.<br /><br />In all, the book is a fine introduction to pantheism, and I hope that this spirituality continues to flourish.

So I know what I'm saying: this book really is great.<br /><br />Sure, it's about 8 years old, too old in cosmology. In particular, the discovery that the universe is accelerating has changed a lot of the questions that cosmologists contemplate. But even if you read a book that was published yesterday, it'll be out of date next month. So you have to either hang out in the physics lounge at Princeton, or accept that you're gonna be behind a bit. As it goes, I think that this book is so good that it's certainly worth reading even though it's a bit old.<br /><br />I especially recommend this book if it will be your first book on cosmology.<br /><br />I bought it because of the discussion of the structure in the universe: superclusters of galaxies, and beyond them to the sheets and bubbles that seem to be the largest structures in the universe. I'd been curious about these things, and never read a good account of them until this book. He covered it all, including reviewing our local intergalactic neighborhood, the Virgo cluster and supercluster, and the mysterious Great Attractor. He discussed the formations of galaxies and stars and planetary systems, including our own solar system. Not since Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" had I read such an enjoyable discussion of this topic--the one that fascinated me so much as a child.<br /><br />That's high praise.<br /><br />But I was also surprised by how well other things in cosmology were explained. Of course the question of the geometry of the universe was well explained; even better, the discussions of inflation and Linde's chaotic inlation and multiverse were great. The issue of dark matter was very well covered. Relativity was explained well enough, and the world of quantum physics was explored enough to make the points Ferris wanted to make. (He didn't explain Smolin's black hole based multiverse, probably because it's a lot more speculative than Linde's inflationary multiverse.)<br /><br />Every pop science writer has to simplify things, and at some point offer explanations that someone will consider inadequate. I thought his discussion of the principles of life on earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life were great, but they were probably a bit too brief for someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. I think a first-time reader would not understand several points in his description of quantum theory. But hey, when you're sure you don't understand quantum theory, that's evidently about as close as you'll ever get.<br /><br />The same goes for his discussion of the anthropic principle and God. Now, actually I basically agree with Ferris' worldview (strong agnosticism), and I think his discussion of it was spot-on. But if I had to write it, I would have gone a bit more slowly, explaining things in a bit more detail. You can find among these reviewers some who criticize Ferris for saying that cosmology doesn't prove God's existence. Well, it doesn't. Ferris also explained that it doesn't disprove God's existence. But Ferris doesn't flatter theists as much as some other writers in the field.<br /><br />All the same, the general discussion about the universe was great.<br /><br />Incidently, if you're primarily interested in quantum physics rather than cosmology in particular, I recommend Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe.\\" Not so well-written, but in greater depth is Nick Herbert's \\"Quantum Reality.\\" If you're primarily interested in multiple universes, look at Smolin's \\"Life of the Cosmos\\" but especially at Guth's \\"The Inflationary Universe.\\" And if you're interested in the end of the universe, I suggest Davies' \\"Last Three Minutes.\\" And finally, although it's a bit dated in some respects, the best exploration of the theological implications of cosmology (which bothered some reviewers of this book so much) remains Paul Davies' \\"God and the New Physics.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't read about cosmology yet, get one of thesebooks and enjoy it.

So it is not surprising that Levinson, despite good intentions, largely failed.<br /><br />The first entry is ancestor worship, which I know only a little about, and I felt like I learned from it. If you don't know much about the articles, they're all like this.<br /><br />Next was animism, which was a fair entry; and asceticism, which I can't evaluate. The astrology entry was good. Curiously I couldn't find any hint that it might be pseudo-science, but it was fascinating as a history and phenomenology. The entry on Bahai was just alright. He left out everything controversial, but the information he did present was accurate.<br /><br />But the entry on Buddhism, from a scholarly point of view, was a joke. There was no hint of critical history, only a single paragraph covering the texts. He drastically misrepresents Theravada tradition; yet the sub-sections titled \\"Religious Practices\\" and \\"Festivals\\" dealt only with the practices of the Theravada, as though Tibetan or Japanese practices were identical.<br /><br />Moving on, the entry on cannibalism seemed fine to me; I don't know much and was inclined to agree with what Levinson argued.<br /><br />Next, Christianity: another horrible entry. His entry was downright theological in its lack of historical consideration. He seems to regard the Jesus Seminar as the best source of speculation about the historical Jesus. He writes about Paul as though he'd never heard of Jewish apocalypticism. Gnosticism has been one of the most exciting areas of recent discussions, and Levinson writes merely, \\"Paul was not the only person to expound upon Jesus' teaching at this time, however, and several different sects wre formed, including some involving mysticism.\\" And that's it; who is he talking about? Both inadequate and uninformative.<br /><br />I had planned to read straight through the book, but at this point I started skipping around. On almost any topic that I knew about--for instance Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism--the coverage was so spotty that I almost have to call it inaccurate, and certainly inadequate. He writes the history of Judaism, skipping from Masada to 1492. With that kind of record, how can I trust the entries on topics I don't know about?<br /><br />I'm sure that a lot of the information in the book is accurate: I have to admit that the entry on Eastern Orthodoxy wasn't terrible. But it's so spotty that I will only reluctantly even refer to it, and never trust it entirely.<br /><br />I suspect that the \\"Harper-Collins Dictionary of Religion\\" would be better, and I hope to get around to checking it out eventually. If you are looking for a book like this, I recommend starting there instead.hat I knew about--for instance Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism--the coverage was so spotty that I almost have to call it inaccurate, and certainly inadequate.

The back of the book promises an account of science and religion, taking a naturalist view of reality (that nothing supernatural exists) but still leaving room for religion: \\"religious traditions remain important as bodies of wisdom and vision....\\" Drees also mentions the subconscious power of religious ritual.<br /><br />But the majority of the book is actually a survey of the encounter of science and religion, and all the ways that religion's responses are failures. There is very little constructive consideration of religious tradition.<br /><br />I actually agree with Drees on almost every idea he wrote in this book. I anticipated that, hoped he would stretch my mind a bit, and was not disappointed. I especially enjoyed Drees' critiques of some of Alvin Plantinga's arguments; as well as his critiques of William Alston's \\"Perceiving God.\\" He also spent a good deal of time responding to the philosophies of John Polkinghorne, Ian Barbour, Arthur Peacocke and Eugene D'Aquili, which I've never taken seriously enough to consider; and if Drees' treatment was accurate, my dismissive attitude was appropriate. He takes Daniel Dennett, Gordon Kaufman more seriously than I would have, and I have to reconsider my position on them. [Edit: A few years later, I now have huge respect for Daniel Dennett. I was misled by his popularity!] Also, he introduced me to Philip Kitcher and Jerome Stone, two thinkers whose ideas I look forward to considering. (Kitcher and Ernan McMullin appear to have strongly influenced Drees.) Other readers would have their own responses depending on which ideas they like or don't like.<br /><br />His coverage of the arguments is fine, and his own arguments are brief. Although I share his views, I understand that someone who didn't would be mildly challenged by Drees; I think he could probably be more convincing if he was more considerate of the reader, explaining his ideas and arguments more thoroughly.<br /><br />His writing is like peering through clouds of chalkdust, listening to a monotone lecture in a room with too much background noise and poor acoustics: \\"In terms of the two varieties of theological anti-realism distinguished above, the issue is that the justification of theological claims has to overcome both the ineffability of God and the difference between ordinary and divine reality, whereas a similar justification in the sciences is restricted to the ineffability of reality 'as such', and thus only to problems related to an assessment of the match between theories and reality, rather than between theories and two realms of reality.\\"<br /><br />I understand that he, and other academic writers, are under expreme pressure to \\"publish or perish.\\" They don't have time (nor perhaps the ability, nor perhaps the charity) to edit and re-edit and craft sentences that make their point without anesthetics. But unless you really think you can endure 280 pages of that, don't even pick this book up, let alone lay down cash for it.<br /><br />(The previous reviewer wrote that Drees is incoherent. I don't think that's true, but you sure have to work hard to know better.)<br /><br />I was also disappointed how little of the book was practical or existential. He mentions the value of religious traditions and liturgy almost as an endnote, and he evidently has no interest in exploring the matter in more depth. But that is exactly what I wanted most. He very briefly argues that naturalist ethics are possible, but doesn't even hint at the principles or content of such ethics.<br /><br />Again, I agreed with nearly everything Drees wrote in this book, so my only criticisms are the exhausting writing and existential thinness. So, if you are interested in these kinds of ideas, I recommend considering books by Ursula Goodenough, Chet Raymo, E. O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, David Cortesi, Taner Edis, Robert Solomon, Daniel Dennett, Owen Flanagan, or J. L.

Discipline is often a big problem for me.<br /><br />I believe this book is 100% correct and very helpful. In the two weeks since I read and implemented the ideas I've learned in it, the behavior in my classes (especially the youngest kids) has improved so much. I was burning out fast, and now I'm beginning to enjoy my job again.<br /><br />My situation is different than normal teachers, with its own challenges and advantages. An EFL teacher like me will have to be a little creative using these techniques because communicating with the kids is much more challenging. But it can be done.<br /><br />The book briefly mentioned having a system of rewards such as \\"PAT\\" or \\"Preferred Activity Time.\\" Here is my one disagreement with the book, and it is a small one: this is one of the most effective methods of classroom management I know of.<br /><br />A second criticism, and another small one, is that the book assumes you basically know how to teach; for instance, if you want younger children to behave well you have to keep them busy and entertained. That is part of classroom management, but the author of this book evidently considers it basic teaching skills and outside the scope of her book.<br /><br />Harry Wong's book, \\"The First Days of School,\\" is a little broader in scope than this book, and although it doesn't deal with classroom management nearly as thoroughly, I recommend it along with this book to any struggling teacher, EFL or not.	2005-06-12

But that is a shame for the forests of the world, because I estimate it has about 40 pages of content. There's a lot of white space in this book!<br /><br />But to be fair, that's a criticism of the publisher's judgment, not the content. The content is reasonable.<br /><br />Kurtz hopes that the affirmations (which are marked by bullet points) \\"can provide guidelines for courageous inquirers seeking paths toward a New Englightnment.\\"<br /><br />The book is first of all a basic explanation of humanism, mentioning political goals such as democracy and freedom of speech, and personal goals such as integrity and creativity.<br /><br />Second, it's a brief account of the meaning of life. He writes, \\"What is vital... is that humanists are not overwhelmed by the tragic character of the human condition; they are willing to face death, sorrow, adversity, and suffering with courage and equanimity.\\" Later, \\"The humanist accepts the fact that the human species has imperfections and limitations and that some things encountered in existence may be beyond redress or repair. Even so, he or she is convinced that the best posture is... to exert the intelligence and fortitude to deal with life's problems.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Kurtz's main message is to embrace life with passion; he evidently prefers the word \\"exuberance.\\" I think the best bullet point in the book is on page 72, \\"The so-called secret of life is... found in the experiences of living: in the delights of a fine banquet, the strenuous exertion of hard work, the poignant melodies of a symphony, the appreciation of an altruistic deed, the excitement of an embrace of someone you love, the elegance of a mathematical proof, the invigorating adventure of a mountain climb,\\" and so on. That's the meaning of life, says Kurtz.<br /><br />He includes chapters on eroticism, marriage or civil union, parenthood, and political activism. An interesting chapter dealt with facing death with courage, and included this remark, \\"My life... is my project; it is my own work of art. Every part of my life fits together... [it] is of my own making.\\"<br /><br />It seems that Kurtz meant to make declarations, to announce to the world these affirmations of humanism, and not to review the thought behind them at all. He seems to have the enthusiasm of an activist, and with it an impatience for quiet reflection. (\\"Who has time for navel-gazing?! Let's get busy!\\")<br /><br />I agree with 95% of what he actually writes, and I don't want to seem to criticize that at all. But personally, I was hoping for a more thoughtful exploration of the meaning of life.

Although a few of the references are dated because the book was written in 1930, all of the ideas are still perfectly relevant.<br /><br />2. This is not a book of formal philosophy; more of introspection. Of course Russel introspected with the same brilliant and critical mind that he used to contribute to mathematics and philosophy. But this is not rigorous, apologetic or systematic. Actually, it's more like gentle advice. And quite reasonable.<br /><br />I'd like to quote a few passages that I found thought-provoking, to give a reader a sense of what to expect if you purchase and read this book:<br /><br />p. 27, \\"[T]o be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.\\"<br /><br />p. 29, \\"The habit of looking to the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one. There can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts.\\"<br /><br />p. 43, \\"I do not deny that the feeling of success makes it easier to enjoy life.... Nor do I deny that money, up to a certain point, is very capable of increasing happiness. What I do maintain is that success can only be one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.\\"<br /><br />p. 74, \\"The essentials of human happiness are simple, so simple that sophisticated people cannot bring themselves to what it is that they really lack.\\"<br /><br />p. 94, \\"[R]emember that your motives are not always as altruistic as they seem to yourself... don't overestimate your own merits... don't expect others to take as much interest in you as you do in yourself.\\"<br /><br />p. 99, \\"No satisfaction based upon self-deception is solid, and however unpleasant the truth may be, it is better to face it once and for all, to get used to it, and to proceed to build your life in accordance with it.\\"<br /><br />p. 107, \\"One should respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways.\\"<br /><br />p. 109, \\"Happiness is promoted by associations of persons with similar tastes and similar opinions.\\"<br /><br />p. 123, \\"The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.\\"<br /><br />p. 142, \\"In the best kind of affection a man hopes for a new happiness rather than for an escape from an old unhappiness.\\"<br /><br />p. 175, \\"To ignore our opportunities for knowledge, imperfect as they are, is like going to the theater and and not listening to the play.\\"<br /><br />Well, that's a reasonable sample.

In fact, the book is so excellent that I really have nothing to say about the book itself, only about the information in it.<br /><br />First of all, Wells explains why most researchers have given up the hypothesis of multi-regional human evolution in favor of the migration out-of-Africa hypothesis. He quickly tells us what we need to know about human evolution for this book's purposes, and moves on to charting that migration.<br /><br />He also helpfully reviews what is known about Mitochondrial DNA and African Eve.<br /><br />The main part of the book, of course, is about how different versions of the genetic information on the Y-chromosome can help us chart our ancestry and ancient human migrations. He covers about twelve significant variations, which correspond to ancestors of different groups of people around the world. For example, most European/White men have a marker known as M173, which first appeared in Central Asia about 30,000 years ago. So I and other white people can trace our paternal ancestry to a single man in Central Asia 30,000 years ago. That's remarkable. He gives a similar account for people all over the globe--except Africa, unfortunately.<br /><br />He deals with a few controversial points, such as the origins of Native Americans and Basque people. He's not overly careful politically, but he sticks to the science.<br /><br />He tells us a little about comparative linguistics and hypotheses about the evolution of languages, and how that's relevant to human migration. However, this part of the book raises more questions than answers, especially when it deals with the Indo-European languages, which seems to reflect the current state of knowledge rather than any fault of the author's.<br /><br />He also deals with a little archaeology, only when it helps to clarify a situation. For instance, it appears that the spread of a particular genetic marker corresponds to the spread of rice cultivation.<br /><br />My main complaint is that I'd like a lot more detail; but then the book wouldn't be so popular, would it? It's short and sweet as it is. But I wonder, for instance, if there is any remaining genetic evidence of Alexander's or Genghis Khan's \\"conquests.\\" Did they leave much of a mark? How much? Since I live in Korea, I wonder how many Koreans really are descended from ancient Korean kings? And how far back, exactly? How closely are Koreans related to Japanese or Mongolians or the Manchus? In terms of my own ancestry, can Wells identify the offspring of various invasions of the British Isles? I'd be fascinated to know whether my paternal ancestors were Celts or Romans or Normans or what. There are so many ethnicities in the world, and I wonder what we know about them. And, as I said above, unfortunately he didn't even begin to cover Africa. I'm sure that sorting out these details is very very complex, but also very interesting. I look forward to more books on these topics within a few years.<br /><br />Wells did deal with the interesting topic of patrilocality (wives moving into husbands' communities) and the misconception of men sowing their oats broadly and wildly. And he points out that a few men tend to reproduce much more than other men. These points raise interesting questions, at least in my mind, about human nature. But Wells does not get philosophical; folks like me have to look to other authors for that, such as Jared Diamond and Matt Ridley.<br /><br />But I was very fascinated to read, in a recent National Geographic, that we can order a kit from Wells and have our own DNA checked, and find out what we can about our own ancestry.

I am no scholar of in Sufi music by any means, but... this is wonderful music. I imagine that any expert in Sufi music must think this is a meager selection, though obviously a single album must be just a sample. At any rate, the selection of artists is diverse: from Pakistan, Iranian Kurdistan, Egpyt, Turkey, Syria, Senegal, Morocco.<br /><br />But in a sense, all that is beside the point. If you are even considering buying this CD, then you are probably not an expert in Sufi music any more than I am. You probably are just curious, or you have some related interests. Well, I'll tell you my experience with this music. I'm pretty familiar with Christian sacred music, including American Protestant traditions, Byzantine and Slavic chant, and the classical tradition. I've studied Islam a little, as an outsider, and I'm a little wary of the popular enthusiasm for Sufism. Nevertheless, I was curious, and willing to drop a few dollars for an interesting experience. So what happened?<br /><br />This is awesome music. You have to listen to it loudly, like rock and roll or, to an extent, the blues. I know that comparison will rankle, but folks'll have to deal with it. The comparison is that you have to let your bones feel it, the music has the power to hit you, to make you dance and want to scream with it. It is powerful music, overwhelming, intense; I'm tempted to say tribal or primitive. Brutal, passionate and soaring. Borrowing one of my friend's bon mots, I like to say that the music of Marie Keyrouz makes me want to go to church. He said that of Bach and Stravinsky. Well, this Sufi music makes me want to go to wherever I can participate in it. If you let it move you, this music will make you want to love God. (However, I should probably reveal that I strongly doubt that any deity exists.)<br /><br />If it's your first CD of Sufi music, it won't be your last.	2005-05-13

For instance, last year I read \\"Life of Pi,\\" which for some reason everyone seems to rave about, and I thought it was just ok. I thought \\"The Alchemist\\"  was terrible, but many intelligent people endorse it. Now I'm reading \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and finding it slow going. But I'm not totally biased against the genre; I read Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\" recently, and loved it. I can't get enough of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky or Orwell. But they're all dead, aren't they? So there's some background on my tastes, and an explanation for why, despite a strong recommendation from an intelligent friend of good taste, I didn't expect to like this book very much.<br /><br />Sure enough, I thought the first chapter was moderately entertaining, but predictable. That changed as the book went on: Barnes is a very nice writer; the first chapter was probably the most difficult to write. Immediately the book gets more interesting. From the beginning of the second or third chapter, you realize that Barnes is playing with you. The simplicity is deceiving and you have the opportunity to think hard if you want to. The better chapters are sometimes even subtly shocking, yet they remain light and playful. On the other hand, the last chapter is very simple but I will probably never forget it. I may even try to write my own version of it.<br /><br />The book is quite challenging, full of philosophy written into flesh. Barnes manages to tread a fine line between being sufficiently post-modern to please the chattering literature types, and being traditional enough to please more critical folks like me. I was pleased.<br /><br />I don't want to give away anything, other reviewers will certainly do that if you are interested. But I will confidently recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading an intelligent story. Interestingly, as with \\"Life of Pi,\\" not too far below the surface, this is a book about religion. But whereas \\"Life of Pi\\" is advertised as a book that will make you believe in God, I would advertise this as a book that will make you an atheist. Of course that's all just wind, but this is a very satisfying and clever book.<br /><br />I want to especially recommend it to folks who, like me, sometimes find themselves defending the theory of evolution to its fundamentalist critics. It's very entertaining from this point of view.I would advertise this as a book that will make you an atheist. Of course that's all just wind, but this is a very satisfying and clever book.

I was curious about lovingkindess (metta) meditation, which I'd heard of when I was in Burma, although as a beginner, I chose to stick to insight meditation.<br /><br />Somehow I thought this book would be the best introduction to me, and I ordered it. But let me confess, at first I failed to appreciate it. I read about 20 pages, I was bored, and I put the book down for about 8 months. That's fine, insight meditation never hurt anyone.<br /><br />I don't remember why I was initially so bored by the book. Perhaps it was because of her conversational style, full of stories from her own or her friends' experiences. Most people like that kind of thing, it makes the author's ideas easier to understand, more familiar and more human; but I usually prefer an author to state their point and move on, without personal stories. Anyway, the stories she shares actually illuminate her points quite well.<br /><br />When I picked the book up again (8 months later), somehow it hit me this time. I read it in about 2 weeks, and it only took me that long because I actually did many of the meditation exercises she suggests. I intend to keep going back and doing more of them.<br /><br />She does a good job presenting the tradition of metta meditation, as far as I can tell, although I'm certainly no expert on it.<br /><br />Since she's Buddhist, naturally she believes in karma and reincarnation, but I don't. So I, as a thorough skeptic, appreciated the lack of supernaturalism throughout the book. In the penultimate chapter she gave an account of karma, but that was all.  She was very considerate to skeptics in that regard. The rest of the book is sharply focused on the techniques and principles of metta meditation and their benefits in this life.<br /><br />That makes it a book I can strongly recommend, regardless of your religious inclinations, if you want to practice metta meditation. You don't need to believe in karma or reincarnation to benefit from it!<br /><br />But let me add a little caveat to that. I am not a great teacher or anything, but if you're just starting meditation, I'd recommend trying insight meditation first.<br /><br />One more small note: On beliefnet.com, you can enjoy some guided meditations led by the author of this book, for free.to believe in karma or reincarnation to benefit from it!<br /><br />But let me add a little caveat to that.

US	49551923	R2SQSGUE5L8J7M	0415248000	692729451	On the Meaning of Life (Thinking in Action)	Books	3	20	31	N	Y	not persuasive	In \\"On the Meaning of Life\\" John Cottingham argues that there is no meaning in life without worshipping God. He considers some arguments for and against God's existence, and concludes that the arguments aren't persuasive either way. Therefore, we must live and worship as if there is a God. Through that practice, we will convince ourselves, of discover, the truth or religion, and our lives will have meaning.<br /><br />The first controversial part is his thesis that there is no meaning without God. He argues that the scientific worldview seems to have created a cheerless, joyless life; and turning (or returning) to religion is the only solution.<br /><br />He says that we cannot create the meanings of our own lives, because arbitrary activities are not good enough. We must be moral to have meaningful lives. At this point, he thinks he's argued that religion is necessary. He does not argue that morality must be transcendently grounded, but he assumes it. A big assumption!<br /><br />A second controversial part is his thesis that moral action is worthless without hope that good may be endlessly perpetuated.<br /><br />Really? I once met a homeless man dying of AIDS. He was barely alive, he had a variety of awful diseases, and fungus was eating him alive. A friend of mine was trying to find a hospital that would admit him, and I shared a silent cup of coffee with him. No hospital would accept him, and he disappeared back into the places in the city where no one looks. That was several years ago, and now he's certainly dead. He was dying a slow, agonizing, awful death; and neither he, nor my friend, nor I had any hope of preventing it. There was no hope. But was the cup of coffee meaningless? Of course not. And if tomorrow a nuclear holocaust or a surprise comet destroys humanity, will our lives have been meaningless? Of course not. Because every moment of life is precious, no matter how it all ends. This part of Cottingham's argument is simply wrong.<br /><br />A third controversial point is that he encourages us to adopt a religion's practices without believing in its doctrines. We will come to believe, he assures us. He realizes that this will be anathema to many philosophers, as indeed it should be. What difference is there between this and self-deception? I would rather live a meaningless life and be aware of it, than live a meaningless life and deceive myself about it. Frankly, his suggestion is unethical.<br /><br />As a postscript, but not as a central part of his argument, Cottingham adds that experiences of profound beauty, such as seeing the starry heavens above that enthralled Kant, are hints that there is another universe, a more profound and meaningful one, than this. But please. Such experiences of beauty are hints that this universe that we inhabit is itself profund and meaningful. They do not, except to the eyes of faith, point to another world. (And it is just possible that the eyes of faith, looking to some other world, fail to fully appreciate the profound beauty of this world!)<br /><br />So the book is Cottingham's defense of a liberal Christian practice and worldview. He won't satisfy a traditional Christian who cares about the dogmas of her faith, nor any non-Christian reader. He has a few comments on the faith that Buddhism requires, and he mentions Islamic monotheism a few times, but that is his only nod to the majority of the world who live evidently meaningful lives without Christian faith. To anyone who is aware that non-Christian spiritualities are legitimate options, Cottingham's arguments will be unsatisfactory, if relevant at all.<br /><br />Besides that, even within a Christian culture it is very difficult to argue that atheists and other non-Christians don't have meaningful lives. Atheists certainly seem to, and any argument that contradicts the plain evidence so blantanly needs to be much more persuasive than this one.<br /><br />But a deeper, harder hitting refutation involves the premise of thebook: to some people, science might seem to have taken the joy out of our existence. But that is not obvious to me! I think the meanings of our lives are exactly what they were before we knew where we came from.<br /><br />Along these lines, I recommend Ursula Goodenough's [[ASIN:0195136292 The Sacred Depths of Nature]]. In that short, lovely book she shows conclusively that a scientific worldview does not in any way take the joy or meaning out of life. She calls her position \\"religious naturalism.\\" If you are really curious about the meaning of life, I strongly believe you will be more enlightened by her book (and others like it such as Chet Raymo's books) than this one.<br /><br />Edit: A helpful commment suggested Hadot's [[ASIN:0674013735 What Is Ancient Philosophy?]] as more helpful than Goodenough's book for skeptics who are in an urban environment or not so interested in nature. I haven't read that but it does look good.

Other civilizations he mentions are Orthodox (Russia, Greece, Serbia, Romania, etc.), Latin America, Japan, Buddhism (mainland Southeast Asia), and Hindu (India). These civilizations relate to each other with varying degrees of hostility or cooperation. That's the thesis; it's pretty simple and really it probably shouldn't be so controversial.<br /><br />But there are several sources of controversy.<br /><br />In general, he infuriates liberals because he allows that race and religion are factors in politics, and he is a realist about the nature of politics and the fact of violence.<br /><br />He believes that the West is declining relative to Islam and Sinic civilizations. He is obviously correct, although it infuriates American patriots and many proud Europeans. The rise of China is creating huge changes in East Asia, as Chinese military and economic power becomes the dominant factor, replacing American power. Managing this transition is one of the great challenges of current US foreign policy. He was among the first to recognize this.<br /><br />He famously says that Muslim civilization has bloody borders, mentioning conflicts between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Balkans, Nigeria, Sudan, Kashmir, the Caucasus, Israel-Palestine, Lebanon, Chechnya, Xinjiang, the Philippines, and perhaps a few other examples. This infuriates many liberals, including especially liberal Muslims.<br /><br />However, he evidently believes that these conflicts stem primarily from a demographic youth bulge. He also believes that if there were a clear leader of Islam, as Russia is the clear leader of the Orthodox, that its borders would be far more peaceful. So, contrary to some of his critics, he does not believe that Islam is inherently violent. In fact, he explicity recognizes that Christianity has been as militaristic as Islam has ever been. (So he manages to aggravate many Europeans and Christians as well.)<br /><br />But for whatever reasons, Islamdom and Christendom are obviously generally in conflict. Huntington was among the first to recognize that this conflict is one of the principal issues of international relations today. The conflict is complex, however, and Huntington's treatment of it here is quite brief and simplistic, and few people interested in it will be satisfied. In particular, his description of the Balkan conflict will upset most people who have not considered a Serbian perspective.<br /><br />He does not believe the West should try to push its values on the rest of the world, including the concept of human rights. Internationally, he is a multi-culturalist, believing that the West should not bother trying to spread its culture: it just creates unnecessary conflict. Other cultures will not accept Western principles anyway, and they have their own principles which are just as good. This infuriates many liberals.<br /><br />He seems to think the United Nations is irrelevant, and he portrays the &#34;Davos Culture&#34; of Western-oriented leaders in other cultures as basically irrelevant. You can guess who disagrees.<br /><br />However, a lot of his critics believe that he thinks the West is better than other civilizations. He certainly believes the West is a unique and valuable civilization, worth preserving. He explicitly argues that multi-culturalism is cultural suicide for the West. He has a self-consciously white American perspective. This also upsets a large number of liberals and most academics.<br /><br />He believes that Europeans and the US should cooperate more closely, with the US in the lead. But of course many Europeans hate the US and its influence, secretly or openly. So guess who doesn't like this idea?<br /><br />He believes that the USA could become a divided nation if Hispanic influence continues to grow, and he considers this a bad thing; an implication is that Hispanic immigration and influence should be limited. (I think he might be more explicit about this, as well as his fear of multiculturalism, in his new book, &#34;Who are We?&#34;) Again, reactions are predictable.<br /><br />He also evidently believes the Europeans are right to resist the Muslim immigrants in their nations, and not to allow Turkey to join the EU. Many liberals, especially North Americans, disagree with him.<br /><br />Another source of controversy is that he considers India a Hindu civilization, although it is surely multi-religious. Islam? Sikhism? Even Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Christianity have significant numbers in India. So however India is to be classified, it is evidently a secular country, and that is why Hindu fundamentalism exists.<br /><br />Every big picture must be very simplified, and this is no exception. However, it is a reasonable big picture. I agree with a lot of this picture: China, the US, the EU, Russia (and the Orthodox world) and the Muslim world are the current principal actors in international relations. India and Latin America are due to emerge as well. Peace and cooperation among them are essential. Huntington dwells on conflict and the capacity for conflict; however, he obviously wants to avoid a violent clash of civilizations. Many of his critics did not read the last chapter, in which this is clear, carefully enough. Also, the West, including the US, must accept a smaller role in the world than we are accustomed to. International organizations such as the UN need to be restructured recognizing current realities (rather than the Cold War)--and that will be a reduction in European influence.<br /><br />I disagree with him about a lot of things, however: especially his idea of the US' identity, his dislike of multi-culturalism, and that he evidently accepts genocide and torture as relatively normal. There are a number of smaller points as well.<br /><br />Anyway, whether you agree or disagree with him, if you want to have an educated opinion on international politics, this book is required reading. I am very disappointed that many reviewers essentially write, &#34;Don't read this! It will contaminate your mind with heresy!&#34; Please. Let the ideas compete. These are important ideas. It may be melodramatic, but the future of the world is at stake, right?licit about this, as well as his fear of multiculturalism, in his new book, &#34;Who are We?&#34;) Again, reactions are predictable.

US	49551923	R1S95LVGH24OOB	0300090889	104837671	Cosmos, Chaos, and the World to Come, 2nd Edition	Books	5	33	35	N	Y	introductory, brief, excellent	This is an elementary introduction to ancient religion, focusing on the issues in the title: cosmos, chaos, and the world to come. It considers ancient Egyptian religion, Mesopotamian religion, Vedic religion, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and very early Christianity--all extremely briefly, focusing only on the issue of the cosmic struggle against chaos, and the development of the apocalyptic worldview. If you are only slightly aware of what all that could mean, this book will entertain you greatly. I am well aware of all of them, and I learned little beyond details from this book, and yet I enjoyed reading it very much.<br /><br />However, if you want depth on any of these topics, there are other books for you. For Zoroastrianism, begin with Mary Boyce. For early Christianity, begin with E. P. Sanders and move on to Ehrman. For ancient Mediterranean religion, begin with \\"Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide.\\" And consider \\"The Other God.\\"<br /><br />Cohn's argument that Zoroastrianism had a huge influence on ancient Judaism and Christianity, is in my opinion unquestionable, and yet neither emphasized nor even recognized in academic circles, nor widely known among the general public. Somehow it is perceived as embarrassing to Judaism, and yet I think that is ridiculous: after all, the influence on modern Judaism is minute, and who does Zoroastrianism threaten? Jesus, Paul, Hillel and the author(s) of Daniel were still Jews, even if influenced by Zoroastrianism. In fact, in my opinion, they are far more interesting! Similarly, isn't Christianity more interesting precisely because it assimilated so much \\"pagan\\" influence? So I hope this book is read widely and its argument more popularly acknowledged.	2005-03-09

I'm in basic agreement with much of his worldview, although I think he's not skeptical enough here and there. He set himself several tough tasks in this book, and I'm not sure he really succeeded at any of them. Yet I don't think he really tried either, his main point was different.<br /><br />He didn't go into enough depth about the evolution of altruism or cooperation. For that, I suggest you turn to Matt Ridley. He didn't go into enough depth about free-will either, but that doesn't matter to me since I think it's probably an insoluble problem. He does a very good job of covering the pop-culture level of debate on ethics, but I think he should have explored various philosophical positions much more thoroughly, and I would have been very pleased if he had covered the ethical positions that various skeptics have held in the past. His own provisional system of ethics are as reasonable as any other, although his attempt to label them scientific is dubious.<br /><br />So I guess the point of this book was to engage in the pop-culture debate on ethics, to take on Dr. Laura and the religious right. So he avoided philosophical complications and so on, trying to stay relevant to America in the 21st century. Actually I'm not sure how to go about that project, but I appreciate the attempt.<br /><br />The book was pleasant reading, and I enjoyed it. I'm sure that there are deeper, more thorough coverages of everything in it, but probably few are so easy to read. If you're new to the idea that a non-religious worldview could be supremely moral, this is a book that will suprise you; if that idea is old news to you, this book will entertain you.<br /><br />I'd like to add that I think some of Shermer's other work, especially \\"How We Believe,\\" is much better. I'd recommend reading that before this one.	2005-01-23

That is Quammen's best, and one of the greatest popular science books ever written, a thrilling, enlightening classic. This one is just ok.<br /><br />This one has potential: exploring the habitats of \\"man-eating\\" predators, the mythology surrounding them, their place in human psychology, the struggle to preserve them and the questions in that struggle. It could be a fascinating book, and it is pretty darn good.<br /><br />Quammen looks at the Asiatic Lion, which plays a prominent role in the Bible and the rest of ancient European and Near-Eastern culture. But today it only remains in a small and shrinking forest in western India. Quammen goes there and reports on the lifestyles of the people who live in and around that forest, and the chances for the lion's survival.<br /><br />Then he moves to the saltwater crocodile, especially in Australia. Here he does a good job exploring the economic significance of the crocodile and the leather industry, and also on the relations of various aboriginal groups to the crocodile. He does not tell us much about the Australian government's role in conservation, although that must be signficant as well.<br /><br />Next he turns to the grizzlies of Romania, called brown bears everywhere outside of North America. He gives a decent history of their popularity in Yellowstone and Glacier parks, and a great coverage of their place in Romanian forest management, sport hunting, and shepherding. Of course Ceaucescu forms the constant background to the story of the bears in Romania.<br /><br />Finally he goes to the Russian Far East, around Vladivostok, to learn about the situation of the Siberian Tiger. (Not the white-tiger mutants in zoos.) Again he considers the way the traditional local inhabitants feel about the tigers. Here he could have given a better coverage of the Chinese medicine black market for tiger parts--a fascinating subject that hangs over the Siberian tiger, but Quammen barely touches it.<br /><br />From there he turns to Beowulf, Gilgamesh and the Alien movies.<br /><br />Quammen's worldview holds that we humans need an element of wildness, and that our technology and climate control is eliminating not only many beautiful, fascinating creatures but also an essential part of our psyche. He doesn't force his view on his readers, but it is obviously in the background.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with this book, honestly. I'm a big fan of Quammen, and I expected a lot; it's still better than most other pop-sci books out there. But I'd like to have a better sense of each of these animals' lives: what do they eat, how often do they reproduce, what parasites and diseases do they struggle with, what are the specific immediate and long-term threats to their survival? Moreover, he did a great job looking at Beowulf and Alien, and a pretty good job looking at Gilgamesh. I wish he'd thrown in a few more great monster myths, or myths that show other aspects of the animals he covered, such as the tiger as protector, as creator of the world, and so on. Finally, I wish he'd included a few more predators, especially the python and the Nile crocodile. I would happily have read an 800 page book if he'd written one. But I'm too much of a Quammen fan to deduct a star: the problem isn't that he wrote anything badly or made any mistakes, just that he didn't write enough.<br /><br />Yet.ting subject that hangs over the Siberian tiger, but Quammen barely touches it. <br /> <br />From there he turns to Beowulf, Gilgamesh and the Alien movies. <br /> <br />Quammen's worldview holds that we humans need an element of wildness, and that our technology and climate control is eliminating not only many beautiful, fascinating creatures but also an essential part of our psyche.

It shouldn't be your first book on the topic. (For your first book, try [[ASIN:0060630353 Who Wrote the Bible?]] by Friedman. In this book Smith will not review or attempt to prove source theory, Israel's Canaanite origins, and so on.) But it is about the evolution of Yahweh through his encounters with Canaanite deities on his way to becoming the \\"One God\\" of post-exhilic Judaism.<br /><br />Smith's thesis is that the development of monolatry (which preceeded monotheism) in Israel began with a process of convergence and differentiation. \\"Covergence,\\" he writes, \\"involved the coalescence of various deities and/or some of their features into the figure of Yahweh\\" (7). And differentiation was the process of Israel rejecting its Caananite heritage, creating a separate identity (8).<br /><br />So, he writes, \\"The issue is not one of identifying the earliest instances of monolatry; rather, the old question of explaining monotheism becomes a new issue of accounting for the phenomenon of convergence, a stage in Israelite religion older than the appearance of monolatry\\" (197).<br /><br />The deity Yahweh apparently came to Israel from Edom or another southern location (Smith discusses this in another book, \\"The Origins of Biblical Monotheism\\"). He was incorporated into Israel's pantheon, which was Canaanite: it featured the deities El, Baal, Anat and Asherah prominently. Smith has a lot of experience with the Ugaritic texts, which record Canaanite religion similar to what Israel must have inherited, so he has the ability to find ways that Yahweh has taken over the features of Canaanite gods. (Unfortunately, no one knows what Yahweh was like before he came to Israel.)<br /><br />Smith naturally begins with Yahweh's convergence with El, which must have been complete by the time of the earliest texts: \\"there is no distinct cult attested for El except in his identity as Yahweh (35).\\" Then Smith examines the similarites between Ugaritic El and Biblical Yahweh, such as descriptions (aged patriarchal god with a heavenly court and a kindly disposition to humanity, and so on), epithets (Berit, Shaddai, Elyon), and iconography (bearded, enthroned).<br /><br />Next Smith turns to Baal. There was a transition at some point from Baal being worshipped alongside Yahweh without controversy, to a struggle between their cults, to the final emergence of Yahweh's cult alone. This transition included Yahweh's taking over Baal's imagery as storm god (which may not have been part of his Edomite character), bull, warrior and fertilizing deity. Smith analyzes material in Judges and the historical texts, concluding that the conflict must have arisen (or at least intensified) because of Ahab's and Jezebel's attempt to elevate a foreign god, Baal Shamem of the Phoenicians (distinct from Baal of Canaanite/Israelite heritage). Smith covers the ways that Yahweh's cult adopted Baal's epithets, iconography, descriptions and mythology in the process of replacing him. However, Smith admits that all the evidence indicates that Baal remained a popular deity to the end of the southern kingdom.<br /><br />In this chapter, Smith also looks at Yahweh's acquiring of Anat's martial imagery.<br /><br />Next, he turns to Asherah, where his analysis is probably most controversial. Smith acknowledges that most scholars believe some goddess, probably Asherah, was worshipped during the period of the monarchy; but he believes she may have been forgotten already by the period of the judges. Her symbolism was obviously incorporated into Yahweh's cult (and later purged from it). Smith focuses on textual analysis, not on the ubiquitous figurines that most scholars believe demonstrate popular Asherah worship. He points to various forms of plausible uncertainty--\\"Yet scholars have long suspected that these figurines represent Astarte, and given the maternal imagery for her in Phoenician, this is as plausile an identification as that with Asherah. Moreover, these figurines may not represent any deity (111).\\"<br /><br />A few scholars agree with Smith, but most continue to believe that Asherah was worshipped during that period. Moving on, Smith examines the ways that Yahweh's cult absorbed Asherah's. He analyzes gender language for Yahweh and comparison in this respect to other near eastern deities. He looks at the decline of anthropomorphic imagery in general for Yahweh. Finally, he also considers the figure of Wisdom as a continuation of many of Asherah's features in a way acceptable to monolatrous Yahwism.<br /><br />Smith next briefly looks at solar imagery applied to Yahweh, concluding that on the whole it was an inovation of the monarchy of Judah, under the influence of Egypt's New Kingdom. He also looks at the rejection of this imagery by some Biblical authors.<br /><br />A final chapter looks at transitions in some prominent Israelite cultic practices: the high places, practices associated with the dead, and the Molech sacrifice.<br /><br />All in all: a fine coverage of the covergence of Canaanite deities and Yahweh. The presentation of evidence in some places could be more well-structured, but that is only my opinion. Here is a good book on Israelite religion, suitable for undergraduate students with a little experience, or armchair scholars. (For serious scholars, of course, it is essential.)<br /><br />In addition to this book, Smith himself recommends Zevit's \\"The Religions of Ancient Israel.\\" If you are considering this book or Smith's \\"The Origins of Biblical Monotheism,\\" I recommend this one first.figurines may not represent any deity (111).\\"  A few scholars agree with Smith, but most continue to believe that Asherah was worshipped during that period.

It does a very good job, and is the only book of its kind that I know of. I recommend it--despite its considerable cost--to any student in this field, and very strongly to any interested layperson.<br /><br />Imagine that for some reason one day you wonder about libation in Mesopotamian religion, or Hittite rites of passage, or Greek curses. If you want a brief summary of the known evidence and scholarly interpretation, this is the book you would go to. If you think you might someday find yourself wondering about the god Dagan, this book is yours.<br /><br />The book is over 600 pages long, and although there is no reason for anyone to read it cover to cover, that would be possible and the organization favors it. (I'm trying to do that now.) The writing level is appropriate for college students or graduates, but jargon is rarely used, and well-explained. Each topic is covered briefly but thoroughly, hitting all the background points and giving a student a solid background for further study.<br /><br />In the third part of the book are numerous black and white photos, their subjects consistently well chosen for their fame among scholars. I was pleased to find a picture of a Canaanite cult stand from Taanach that I'd only read about previously. There are perhaps 100 illustrations in all; with about 20 illustrations in color in the center of the book.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a series of essays on various topics, each by well-known and highly respected scholars. At this time shoppers are unable to look inside the book to see the table of contents, so I will list the essays. The topics in the first part include:<br /><br />\\"What is Ancient Mediterranean Religion\\" by Fritz Graf; \\"Montheism and Polytheism\\" by Jan Assman; \\"Ritual\\" by Jan Bremmer; \\"Myth\\" by Friz Graf; \\"Cosmology: Time and History\\" by John J. Collins; \\"Pollution, Sin, Atonement, Salvation\\" by Harold W. Attridge; \\"Law and Ethics\\" by Eckart Otto; \\"Mysteries\\" by Sarah Iles Johnston; \\"Religions in Contact\\" by John Scheid; \\"Writing and Religion\\" by Mary Beard; and \\"Magic\\" by Sarah Iles Johnston.<br /><br />The second part of the book covers histories of the religions of various areas or peoples: Egypt by Jann Assman and David Frankfurter; Mesopotamia by Paul-Alain Beaulieu; Syria and Canaan by David P. Wright; Israel by John J. Collins; Anatolia: Hittites by David P. Wright; Iran by William Malandra and Michael Stausberg; Minoan and Mycenaean Civilzations by Nanno Marinatos; Greece by Jon Mikalson; Etruria by Olivier de Cazanove; Rome by John North; and Early Christianity by Harold Attridge.<br /><br />The third part of the book resembles an encyclopedia, with contributors covering key topics in various regions. The key topics include Sacred Times and Spaces; Religious Personnel; Religious Organizations and Bodies; Sacrifice, Offerings, and Votives; Prayers, Hymns Incantations, and Curses; Divination and Prophecy; Deities and Demons; Religious Practices of the Individual and Family; Rites of Passage; Illnesses and Other Crises; Death, the Afterlife, and Other Last Things; Sin, Pollution, and Purity; Ethics and Law Codes; Theology, Theodicy, Philosophy; Religion and Politics; Controlling Religion; Myth and Sacred Narratives; Visual Representations; Sacred Texts and Canonicity; Esotericism and Mysticism.<br /><br />And in case you actually read straight through, the book ends with an epilogue.<br /><br />So that's it: a thorough scholarly introduction to every aspect of ancient Mediterranean religion.

The \\"left\\" in America needs to use simpler words, like this: \\"Reading this taught me something valuable.\\" Because if this book is what the American right understands, books from the left are written at a level about three grades too high. We need to dumb down our arguments, write and speak to people like they're in about fifth-grade.<br /><br />The charges made in this book are far-ranging, but I'll focus on the ones I really know about: the charges against American higher education. His biggest complaint is that conservative ideas aren't well-received in universities, which is partially true; and one of the reasons for that is that many conservative ideas are inherently anti-intellectual. Of course that's not going to fly at an institution of learning and thought. Consider laughers like \\"scientific creationism\\" that are taken seriously by no one less than the recently re-elected President. Until some real evidence that can stand up to withering peer-review emerges to challenge Darwinism, all the creationists are in for a shock in their first biology, paleontology, archeology, anthropology or ancient history classes.<br /><br />Another problem is that, surprise, there actually are conservatives on campus: student groups as well as professors. There are thriving Christian fellowships, even at Ivy League schools. They are far from being a persecuted minority.<br /><br />Of course there are also students and professors on the far-left, communists and anti-American activists. Hey, this is America, and we still have the freedom of speech, and our universities have chosen to be places filled with the range of ideas, including creationism and communism. Quite frankly, there are more creationists than communists on campus these days. So ideas from everywhere are being exchanged, examined, fought over, adopted, abandoned--and that's the goal. If he wants the far-left to shut up so that he can be the only voice, that's too bad. (That's what he wants: \\"Hear me. I am all for free speech. But... that Lefty should be censored.\\" Yes, he is all for free-speech as long as it does not oppose a right-wing government's actions.) That's what life is like in Saudi Arabia.<br /><br />But he's right that liberal ideas prevail in almost every American college, among faculty and students. That may have more to do with the quality of conservative ideas than with any kind of massive conspiracy to brainwash youth.<br /><br />He charges that expressing a conservative opinion would risk a failing grade. But of course he gives no examples of this, despite the fact that conservative opinions are expressed thousands of times every day in American universities. He is just paranoid; this has probably never happened and if it did the professor was probably appropriately dealt with. It is a ridiculous assertion, believable only by someone completely unfamiliar with the culture of academia.<br /><br />Well, the subtitle reveals that \\"our\\" schools, faith and military are under attack, and the \\"we\\" are conservatives who evidently think they own these things. But actually, those things belong to America, and America is a land of \\"faiths\\" not \\"faith.\\" As the examples of creationism or enforced prayer in schools would show, the assault on both truth and liberty in our schools comes from conservatives.<br /><br />Finally, the most significant assault on our military is coming from Iraqi insurgents. Our men and women should not be over there fighting for Bush's friends' oil, getting wounded for Bush's friends' oil, dying for Bush's friends' oil. The real threat to their lives and well-being is Bush's bald deception and greed, and Americans will be paying for it with our tax dollars and our children's lives for years.<br /><br />Let us--all Americans--hope it's not too late, that folks like Savage here do not manage to succeed in their assault on America, that we do not become a Christian version of Saudi Arabia, where only these hate-spewingclerics have a voice and the government exists solely to further enrich the rich.<br /><br />\\"Of course, while geckos are wonderful creatures and should be protected, the liberal vermin are not.\\" p. 213.<br /><br />2 stars, the second one being just because it openly reveals the threat that America faces today from those aspiring to destroy our freedoms and create a Christian theocracy.hese hate-spewing clerics have a voice and the government exists solely to further enrich the rich. <br /> <br />\\"Of course, while geckos are wonderful creatures and should be protected, the liberal vermin are not.\\" p. 213. <br /> <br />2 stars, the second one being just because it openly reveals the threat that America faces today from those aspiring to destroy our freedoms and create a Christian theocracy.	2004-11-07

Paul Kriwaczek quickly covers Nietzsche, the Cathars, the Manichees, the Roman cult of Mithras, and Zoroastrianism. More accurate and careful books have been written on each of those subjects, but none more enjoyable; and I'm sure this is the only time they have all been dealt with in a single book.<br /><br />Kriwaczek is an honest layman, enjoying himself as he travels across Central Asia, the Middle East and England, reading the works of scholars (and a novelist) and drawing his own conclusions, exploring the legacy of Zarathustra. He explores some of the most fascinating issues in the history of religion, and he entertains the reader with his description of modern rituals.<br /><br />This is not scholarly, academic history, and Kriwaczek admits it. But it's also not the kind of ridiculous stuff you find on the History Channel. Kriwaczek's several speculations are within the bounds of plausibility, and he most of the time he admits when he's speculating.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book because it is so entertaining and fairly accurate. If you wonder why people study ancient religions that no one believes in today, read this and you will know why.<br /><br />However, if you want to read a book about Zoroastrians, I highly recommend Mary Boyce's \\"Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices.\\"<br /><br />Finally, in case you wondered, this is exactly the same book as Kriwaczek's \\"In Search of Zarathustra: The First Prophet and the Ideas That Changed the World.\\"	2004-09-28

So I found this on the publisher's (AltaMira Press) website:<br /><br />Religions-whatever else they may be-are configurations of cultural information reproduced across space and time. Beginning with this seemingly obvious fact of religious transmission, Harvey Whitehouse goes on to construct a testable theory of how religions are created, passed on, and changed. At the center of his theory are two divergent 'modes of religiosity:' the imagistic and the doctrinal. Drawing from recent advances in cognitive science, Whitehouse's theory shows how religions tend to coalesce around one of these two poles depending on how religious behaviors are remembered. In the 'imagistic mode,' rituals have a lasting impact on people's minds haunting not only our memories but influencing the way we ruminate on religious topics. These psychological features are linked to the scale and structure of religious communities, fostering small, exclusive, and ideologically heterogeneous ritual groupings or factions. In the doctrinal mode, on the other hand, religious knowledge is primarily spread through intensive and repetitive teaching; religious communities are contrastingly large, inclusive, and centrally regulated. While these tendencies have long been recognized in the history of the study of religion, the modes of religiosity theory is unique in that it explains why these tendencies exist. More importantly, Whitehouse does not give the final word, but invites us to join a series of collaborative networks among anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, and psychologists, currently trying to falsify, confirm, or refine the theory. Are you tired of the flood of descriptions and interpretations of religions which offer no clear strategy for evaluation, comparison, and testing? Modes of Religiosity can provide you with a new way to think when you think about religion.<br /><br />About The Author<br /><br />Harvey Whitehouse is Professor of Anthropology and Director of Postgraduate Studies in the Faculty of Humanities at Queen's University Belfast.

It says something that not a single well-known economist wrote a blurb for this book's cover. After all, when Wheelan wrote &quot;Naked Economics&quot; he was able to get some. Krugman (himself a very well-respected economist) was able to. Why only this guy can't? Hmmmmmm.<br />It's because a bit of the information here isn't completely accurate, and he is always biased. He will not consider the role of government seriously, and of course tax-cuts and deregulation are the ultimate panacea. (Of course government has its fingers where they shouldn't be. But why not bother to consider where they should be and shouldn't be, like a real economist?)<br />On other matters, where there's no room for politics, he's accurate. Which only draws more attention to the difference when politics are involved.<br />Also, things are just poorly explained. He tries to explain how the Fed's interest rates affect economic growth, inflation and unemployment. But if I hadn't understood that already, there's no way I would have understood his presentation. That kind of thing occurs throughout the book.<br />Two other, less serious, criticisms. First, a lot of interesting stuff has happened in economics since this book was written. The Asian tigers crashed, currency crises in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Russia, the internet stocks and the bubble of the 90s crashing, China and India coming online, and the consequences of Bush II's economic policies. Not covering any of those events is no fault of the author's, but it just means the book is too old.<br />Second, the writing is not that great, and the humor is terrible. His idea of &quot;humor&quot; is, &quot;Let's say Helen buys bananas.&quot;<br />Really, if you want to learn about economics, my first recommendation is &quot;Naked Economics,&quot; Charles Wheelan. That's the book this one is trying to be, and failing. Or check out Krugman (start with &quot;The Return of Depression Economics&quot;). If you want a decidedly conservative perspective, head for Milton Friedman. I also recommend Nobel Prize winners Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz. All much better.(start with &quot;The Return of Depression Economics&quot;). If you want a decidedly conservative perspective, head for Milton Friedman.

It inspired me to become quite a bit more diligent about dealing with mildew, changing my sheets, doing dishes and sorting laundry.<br /><br />I discovered that I enjoy cleaning my house a lot more--or at least that I dread it a lot less--when I feel like I really know what I'm doing. In fact, having a clean house now appears to me as a challenge, and I can feel some pride in my accomplishment. So my house is indeed a lot cleaner.<br /><br />I got two great benefits out of this. First of all, I enjoy being at home more than I used to, which saves money. For instance, I used to prefer not to read in my house, and since reading is my primary hobby, it takes a lot of my time. I spent a lot of time in coffee shops and other places like that, and spent a lot of money on criminally overpriced coffee. But now I also enjoy being at home, listening to the music that I choose. The biggest difference is that my home is more comfortable and clean than it used to be. Secondly, I enjoy having company more than I used to, which helps my social life. Especially, I am happy to have pretty young women visit me. And my clean house represents me very well.<br /><br />So, as a bachelor, I recommend it to other bachelors.	2004-06-19

He discusses how a non-religious person can get all the spiritual, emotional, social and psychological benefits of religion, without sacrificing a single neuron of intelligence, education or critical thinking.<br />He is completly critical of every religious tradition, but also open-mindedly sympathetic to all kinds of spirituality. He has searched for what &quot;they&quot; have, and how they get it. But he has not accepted an ounce of new-age hokeyness. He has kept his analytical mind active throughout.<br />He considers how a person can believe that the universe is purposeless and basically accidental, while still believing that one's own life has meaning. He discusses ways to create community, meditative or contemplative practices, meaningful rituals, ethics, happiness and contentment. He discusses death and self-transcendence and the bliss experience.<br />If you have no religion, or if you are losing your faith, read this book soon. It's full of good advice. It's consistently understated and about as brief as possible (Cortesi is a computer programmer), so you might have to consider his points carefully. It's honest and deeply thoughtful, intelligent and respectful of its audience. Highly recommended.	2004-05-09

I don't think he had any bad experience with Christianity, but his intellectual search just led him away from theism. I suspect that philosophy, science and comparative religion in particular were responsible for his change. As his mind led him out of Christianity, you might think his religiousity would become more shallow; but on the contrary, in his case it became much deeper.<br />Based on his own experience, he sees all of Western culture going through the same process. His thesis is that religion is better off without God. You can see that he already drew one long-winded, critical reviewer, and of course he will never convince any theists. Obviously Billington is just making his points and allowing readers to think for themselves.<br /> (...)<br />Rather than theists, his book seems more directed toward people who are on the fence: maybe they suspect God doesn't exist, but they love or need religion and don't want to give it up. For them, Billington has a fresh Gospel (good news): they can go even deeper when they give God up. If you are in this position, this book will make you think hard, and it might change your life.<br />Now I basically agreed with Billington's thesis before I picked up the book, so you can anticipate my bias. I didn't care about the part of the book he spends criticizing the arguments that try to proove God's existence. Obviously other books do a better job of addressing that huge subject. For me, the interesting parts were his brief descriptions of non-theistic traditions, such as philosophical Taoism, Theravada and Zen Buddhism, and nondualistic Hinduism; as well as the romantic tradition in the West. Again, each of these topics are covered in other, quite lengthy books, so don't look for the last word here. But his coverage is adequate for his purposes.<br />From those traditions, with a very slight contribution from physics, he draws conclusions about the possibilities of religion without god, and his portrait is indeed quite rich.<br />Why only 4 stars? Well, because in my opinion there is much more exploration and explanation to be done. He just mentioned meditation a few times, without exploring it. He didn't fully explore the significance of modern physics, and when he mentions physics he appears dependent on an unfortunate source, Fritjof Capra. Besides, there is more science to explore: he didn't touch evolutionary psychology or the discoveries that are being made by neurologists about religious experience. He only explored a few traditions and not particularly deeply; in my opinion he left out some significant stuff. Most importantly, he needed to show that the essence of theistic religious experience can be had by an atheist, or even more that the most profound religious experience is essentially atheistic. I think such an argument is not easy, but it is possible to make. In short: this book needed to be about 500 pages longer. (IMHO.)<br />However, it is one of the best books I know of for people who are interested in atheistic spirituality.draws conclusions about the possibilities of religion without god, and his portrait is indeed quite rich.<br />Why only 4 stars?

Maybe it's not that bad, but his others are much better, especially &quot;Genome&quot; and &quot;The Red Queen.&quot;<br />Anyway, a lot of research has been done since &quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot; was published. In its time it was better than it is now, but I recommend getting a more recently written book instead.<br />As above, I especially recommend &quot;Genome&quot; and &quot;The Red Queen.&quot;<br />But here are some other books you may want to check out before deciding what to purchase:<br />Jared Diamond's classic &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;<br />Robert Wright's &quot;The Moral Animal&quot; (predates &quot;Origins of Virtue&quot; but is still better)<br />Steven Pinker's &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;<br />Sarah Hrdy's &quot;Mother Nature&quot;<br />Pascal Boyer's &quot;Religion Explained&quot;	2004-04-04

Actually this is not a bad book at all. It is a very pretty account of the rock cycle, of the formation of rocks and landforms. It is not for the academic geologist, but for the hobbyist and amateur, well-written, well-explained and very well illustrated. Actually it is a wonderful book, perfect for rock collectors and so on.<br />Besides its general coverage of standard geology, it is unique for its microscopic photos of rocks and minerals. You will see rocks in a new way, and in these photos you can really see the processses that created the rocks. You can see details that you can't see macroscopically.<br />Anyway, I suspect that reviewer was being dishonest. This book is certainly no field guide to rocks, but it never claims to be. It really is wonderful for rock hounds and hikers and people who are curious about geology.	2004-04-04

Here's the technique I used successfully.<br />First, give each student a photocopy of the page you're going to study. (Kids love comics: it looks like a comic.) Next, if they're old enough, make them write the descriptions of each picture. (&quot;It's ten o'clock. He's watching TV. The program is finished. He's very tired. He gets up and turns off the TV. He stretches and yawns.&quot; And so on.) If they're too young for that, give them the text, read it together with them, and let them color the pictures. Give them homework like this: you write four or five of the descriptions, and they have to draw the picture that goes with it. Of course you put up the best drawings on the wall, and keep the cutest for your refrigerator or shoebox.<br />Next, make them memorize it. Put them in groups: it's one person's job to read the text, and another person's job to act it out. (Kind of total physical response.) This can be a lot of fun for kids.<br />When they've all memorized it (nearly) perfectly, the real fun begins. Now they get to change the stories in their own ways. (&quot;He's watching tv. The program is finished. He's very sad. He's crying. He blows his nose. He gets up and kicks the tv.&quot;)<br />This works very well because the students learn perfect sentences, memorize without much effort, learn while having fun, and naturally begin to create their own sentences. It's the best ESL tool I know for this reason. Amazingly, within weeks my students were using phrases from this book in their own sentences. Their ability with stative verbs increased especially quickly, and their grammar in general improved. Average students began to enjoy expressing themselves in English.<br />And I also use it to study Korean. It's been more helpful than almost any intermediate textbook. So obviously it works for other languages as well, and for adults as well.<br />I really hope they print it again.	2004-04-04

Imagine, you can be a god!<br /><br />If the title doesn't alert you to the fact, there is a lot of overstatement in this book. A lot. From the title to the last sentence, it never stops, it never gets less ridiculous.<br /><br />On the other hand, check out that subtitle again: \\"Never Feel Powerless Again.\\" Do you often feel powerless? If so, you will probably learn a lot from this book. Actually, the book is full of sound advice, insight into human relationships straight from actual academic psychological research. Even if you don't feel powerless often, you will probably find some decent tips in here that will improve your relationships with other people.<br /><br />I'm not sure which to emphasize: the fact that there is a lot of sound advice, or the fact that this author is clearly a salesman targeting socially insecure people and promising them more than he (or anyone) can ever deliver.<br /><br />It's not bad advice, but it is bad form.<br /><br />Anyway, if you think you could benefit from reading this book, you probably could. It helps me to browse it every so often, reviewing some of the principles he discusses.	2004-04-04

Its greatest flaw is the writing: it is not a pleasure to read.<br />I'd already read Matt Ridley's The Red Queen, and it is at once more well-written and more thoughtful and it has a lot more information. So if you're only going to read one book, or if you're wondering which to read first, I recommend Ridley's.<br />I haven't read &quot;The Mating Mind,&quot; but it looks better than this one too.<br />However, despite recommending those other books, I want to emphasize that this one is not that bad. It's just that Ridley's book is so much better.	2004-03-26

It's not bad, and if you enjoy reading about biology you'll certainly enjoy it.<br />But I'd recommend books by Richard Dawkins, especially \\"River Out of Eden,\\" and Matt Ridley, especially \\"The Red Queen,\\" and \\"Genome,\\" ahead of this one. Williams also wrote \\"Why we Get Sick.\\" Although the writing in \\"Pony Fish\\" is better, \\"Why we Get Sick\\" has a lot more information for the curious, and you might prefer it if you've read a bit of Dawkins and Ridley already.<br />In this book, Williams basically explains adaptionist storytelling and shows the coherence and power of modern Darwinism. To readers of Dawkins and Ridley, there will be very little new information. But it won't bore you either. He covers material such as the perfections and flaws of bodies, the evolution of sexuality and the human experience of reproduction. Again, Ridley and Dawkins cover all this in more depth, and they are more readable authors.<br />The highlight of the book is the last chapter, \\"Philosophical Implications.\\" It's fairly understated; but it's interesting to see a great scientist take a stab at the religious and philosophical significance of his science. If there's a reason to read the book, it's just because George Williams wrote it, and you probably don't have the privilege of sitting down with him for coffee and picking his brain. This is what he'd tell you if he had the chance, and it's an opportunity to listen.	2003-11-16

There's some interesting stuff about the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians and Greeks; and a lot of great stuff about early European mathematics; stopping around Euler's time.<br />I hadn't studied trig in about 8 years, and I thought this would be a good review. Boy, was I wrong! I needed to do the review and then study this book!<br />Anyway, if you're a fairly gifted high school trig student, this book will certainly liven up the subject for you. If you're a college math major, it will be easy reading, and certainly interesting. If you're a teacher, you might find something interesting to entertain your students. Otherwise, unless you really like math or are really good at it, this book will probably be really difficult for you.<br />When I was feeling lazy I kind of breezed through the dense equations and looked for the conclusions, but when I was diligent I could usually make sense of them. You can do as I did and you won't miss much. Really, the highlights of the book are the historical information, not the equations. But if you can appreciate the equations as well, then you'll probably really enjoy the book.<br />Of course this isn't a life-changing or eye-opening book, but I gave it 5 stars just so no one thinks there's anything wrong with it.	2003-11-16

There are so many 70 or 80 word long sentences: clauses within clauses, caveats within caveats. It can be simply painful to read. Not only that, but a lot of his concerns relate to the world of academic philosophy; and even when I was an undergraduate philosophy major I didn't relate to that world. All this is not what I expected; buyer beware.<br /><br />However, we all have our own idiosyncratic concerns, and the author is dealing with his own here, and the concerns he perceives in his academic community.<br /><br />As to the content of his thoughts, I generally had little to disagree or comment on; even little to agree with, actually. However, he strained to argue that we can find values within nature, admitting that there are \\"anti-values\\" as well. He seemed concerned to avoid admitting that values come from within us; but I'm not sure that his argument amounted to anything more than semantics, a terminological shuffle.<br /><br />I hesitate to give such negative reviews, especially when I am sure that the author has such good intentions; but I believe that for most people, there are better books out there. Check out Ursula Goodenough.	2003-10-31

But there is a substantial body of knowledge out there, and there is no reason for us (especially, us as voters) to be ignorant of it.<br />This could be read in every intro to econ class.<br />If you're a reader of Krugman's articles and books, but you feel like sometimes you don't really understand what he says, this will be a great book for you. Or if you just don't know about economics, this will be a great book for you.<br />(But after you read this book, I also recommend Krugman's writing. This book is the bird's eye view of economics, while Krugman looks at a few things in more detail.)<br />How does the Fed target interest rates and control money supply? I'd wondered this for quite a while, and here I got a straight answer to it.<br />It's recommended by several economics nobel prize winners, so its content must be solid.	2003-10-26

It will change the way you think about money, which is probably a significant part of your life, and probably one of your bigger problems in life. Figure out how to get on the right track: the one that leads to financial independence.<br />If you're considering reading this book, I suggest you do. You'll probably be much happier for it.<br />After you've built up some savings, you may want to research investments beyond what the authors recommend. That's my only qualification, and it's a small one because there's nothing wrong with what they recommend; it's just not very aggressive. Anyway, many people considering reading this book are probably a long way from needing to research investment opportunities.	2003-10-26

Actually Krugman wrote several in the early nineties, during the NAFTA controversy and Clinton's first term. These are collected in the book Pop Internationalism, which is a fine book for anyone to read, as are Krugman's other books.<br />Of course you can read Thurow's book, and it has some interesting observations, among its flawed analysis, of business cultures in Japan and Europe; they make interesting comparisons with business culture in the USA. For this I give it one star above the minimum.<br />Also, it is interesting that this new updated version includes only a new forward; the text remains unchanged. Perhaps this is a little disappointing, since it would be nice to see Thurow's predictions for the future from now. But its nice to see how wrong he was about all his predictions before. His new forward says that he was wrong because America read his book and reacted.<br />Actually, he was just wrong. So I recommend that you read Pop Internationalism in addition to, if not instead of, Head to Head.	2003-09-24

The information is reliable as far as I know; generally it's very basic. Controversial claims are either carefully explained or carefully avoided.<br /><br />I learned a lot about anthropology while reading this.<br /><br />Well, and that's what a textbook's supposed to do.<br /><br />Specifically, the book covers things like \\"the scope of anthropology,\\" archaeology, very basic linguistics, food collection and production, economic systems, social stratification, gender, marriage and the family, kinship, political life, religion and magic, medical anthropology, and a discussion of possibilities for reducing violence and war. (It ends with, \\"There may be difficulties on the road to solutions, but we can overcome them if we want to. So let's go for it!\\")<br /><br />Notice that a fifth edition has come out.

So I am prepared to believe that the same can be true of other intellectual fields.<br />Like religion, economics matters to most people, and most of us don't know much about it. But I wanted to begin to understand economics, and one of my brilliant friends (a Yale guy who does math for a hedge fund) told me that this book was the place to start. His recommendation should mean more to you than mine!<br />He was right. I now have some basic ideas about things like monetary policy (why what the Fed does matters), currency speculation, supply-side economics, and labor markets. Of course there is a lot more to economics; this book is only a beginning. But it is readable, and well-explained.<br />Let me recommend reading the tutorials at Investopedia.com as well. They were helpful to me.<br />Now I'm at least not a total financial ignoramus, and I look forward to exploring economics more!	2003-07-13

I nearly completed the major before I just got tired of its irrelevance. Solomon nicely summed up my experience, &#34;What had originally been conceived as the love of wisdom had become a tedious technical enterprise, appealing more to students with affective disorders than to those who were seeking the meaning of life.&#34; With such disappointment in the background, I looked forward to recovering a bit of enthusiasm for Western philosophy, to receiving a bit of its wisdom for my life, for my skeptical spirituality.<br /><br />After reading the preface and introduction to this book on Amazon, I ordered it. I had high expectations. I wanted to see a professional, thoughtful philosopher apply insights from the Western philosophical tradition to the problems of spirituality for skeptics: the meaning of life in light of evolutionary psychology and physical cosmology, ethics without authorities, ritual and worship and wholeness in the emerging skeptical traditions, belonging and identity and coalition formation in a world of deadly technology.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that's not what I got, and if that's what you want you'll be as disappointed as I was. He seems to have satisfied himself on such questions long before he encountered spirituality. He is not addressing them in any depth here.<br /><br />Instead, this book is an apology for spirituality in academia, specifically in the discipline of philosophy. Solomon's project is to address the typical moderately liberal concerns of academia and academic philosophy in terms of spirituality. Essentially he's preoccupied with a terminological (cultural) problem: How can a self-respecting academic discuss spirituality. Isn't it just too trite?<br /><br />In retrospect, I suppose this is a worthy mission, but it's not one that means much to me. If it's your concern, this book is probably good for you. But if you are interested in the kinds of questions I was interested in, then this book is either irrelevant or superficial.<br /><br />(I am not sure what Solomon thought his purpose was. He never actually comes out and says, and he seems to think he's discussing deep, meaningful questions throughout the book. And, to be fair, I did pause for thought a few times while reading it. But it's not going to have a lasting impact on me, and he didn't seem concerned that it might. He did seem concerned that he might be misconstrued by a reviewer, so he filled his paragraphs with caveats; obviously he's accustomed to writing for academic journals rather than for a &#34;serious&#34; audience--I mean that literally. Meanwhile, comments throughout the book reveal that his projected audience is familiar with the social scene in Anglo-American academia.)<br /><br />Let me add two more criticisms. Solomon seeks spirituality in partnership with science, but he really appears unfamiliar with science. Perhaps that's a faulty impression; since he's not really thinking about the meaning of life perhaps he doesn't have to address the problems suggested by science.<br /><br />Secondly, he appears unfamiliar with anthropology; although he cites and refers to classical philosophers, modern and contemporary Western philosophers, ancient East Asian philosophers, ancient Indian philosophers, and religious traditions from Pacific islands (he wasn't more specific)--he doesn't take any notice of the contexts of all those philosophers. Once again, a charitable reader could imagine that they are beyond the scope of Solomon's project. So they may be. However, he makes a startling claim on the last page, &#34;For most people, the transformation of self may be nothing more than total immersion in a group and a tradition. But for those of us who enjoy the mixed blessing of seeing beyond all traditions and thus finding ourselves without an anchor in the world, spirituality is rather an arduous process, filled with doubts and misgivings, skeptical of glib formulations and platitudes, ....&#34;<br /><br />Oh my! I submit that Solomon is not seeing beyond all traditions, that actually he is deeply immersed in one, that in fact spirituality in many traditions is an arduous process filled with doubts and misgivings, and that while he is skeptical of certain glib formulations and platitudes, he is swallowing others hook, line and sinker--and spitting them back up in print. In short, he really ought to read some anthropology.<br />His other books are probably much better. To be fair, he admits that spirituality is new to him. Perhaps when he is more familiar with the topic, and more comfortable with his right to address it, he can bring his familiarity with philosophy to it in greater depth. If he tries, I would be happy to read his book.<br /><br />On the bright side, reading the book did inspire me to revisit Sartre, Camus and Heidegger after all this time. Solomon reminded me that they did wrestle with the grand questions I mentioned, and that once upon a time I enjoyed reading their work and thinking about their thoughts and learning from them. I guess that's a meager version of what I wanted after all.#34;  Oh my!

Surprisingly, she was just as insightful in this area! She really has deeply considered the spiritual significance of biology, and her insights were inspiring and refreshing for me. She doesn't over-extend herself either; even as someone with a world-class education in philosophy and religion I found no weaknesses in her thought (and that is very, very unusual).<br />Whether you are depressed by or afraid of science and naturalism, or if you are in love with them, this is a beautiful, profound (yet simple) book for you.	2003-06-23

The first and last essays are the worst; the middle seven are not so bad.<br />In the first essay Kaplan argues that the present peace will not last long, that its \\"degeneration\\" in places like sub-Saharan Africa will lead to anarchy, with disturbing results even in the first world. His main evidence is environmental change and resource depletion (especially soil and water--his argument would be stronger if he included oil). I don't know what golden age Kaplan is looking back to in sub-Saharan Africa (in Eastern Europe I guess it must be the Ottomans); so anarchy there will be no surprise. But with grand assumptions and meager evidence--surely he has more than he cites, but he has to deal with apparently contrary evidence to be truly convincing--he declares breathtaking conclusions, such as the dissolution of the USA into ethnic warfare. Perhaps he's right, but his analysis is so thin that he's not persuasive.<br />Yet there are moments of light, as when he describes the historical perspective of the occupants of Ankara's slums, quoting Naipaul. Or when he analyzes the \\"lies of the mapmaker,\\" more precisely the lies of the post-WWII statesmen who carelessly created the states defined by the lines on the map.<br />So many people naively believe that the 3rd world will inevitably become like the 1st; but Kaplan believes it will go the other way just as inevitably. His first essay is a polemic for his belief. I'm sorry; it has little useful analysis or insight.<br />Reading the second essay, \\"Was Democracy Just a Moment?\\" is like stepping from darkness into light (of course there are still shadows). If you believe that democracy is always the best government, this essay will be challenging for you.<br />The third essay, \\"Idealism Won't Stop Mass Murder,\\" will be interesting for anyone interested in the causes and preventions of genocide and similar massive tragedies.<br />Let me skip around a bit, for it is no small irony that an author concerned with mass murder would write in defense of Henry Kissinger, yet that is the purpose of the seventh essay. Kaplan defends a man who is perhaps American history's worst criminal against critics by systematically understating everything Kissinger did in Vietnam, Cambodia, (Kaplan doesn't mention Laos), Cyprus, Chile, (and he doesn't mention East Timor). See Christopher Hitchens' \\"The Trial of Henry Kissinger,\\" to which Kaplan's essay is a weak response.<br />The fourth essay explains the need for special forces and institutions such as the CIA. He believes--and I agree--that these are the future of warfare.<br />The fifth essay is a review of Gibbon's \\"Decline and Fall.\\" If you don't know why that's famous, Kaplan's essay might even inspire you to try reading it. That happened to me.<br />The eighth essay is another book review, this time of Conrad's \\"Nostromo.\\" Kaplan compares the book to \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and considers its application to the contemporary third world. (A few years ago an edition of \\"Nostromo\\" and \\"Lord Jim\\" was published with introductions by Kaplan.) Another book was added to my reading list.<br />The sixth essay advocates \\"proportional\\" responses to foreign policy. Few would argue with the vague philosophy Kaplan presents, except those who eagerly throw American troops into murky conflicts with unclear goals (Kissinger?). Of course, practical applications and interpretations are the real problem. Anyway, this essay is solid and concise.<br />With the ninth essay Kaplan descends again. Nostalgic for the Cold War and MAD--\\"the Cold War may have been as close to utopia as we are ever likely to get\\" p. 171--he wants to be sure that the US rather than the UN is the power of the future. He is sure that the UN wouldn't have enough war, so it would be unprincipled.

But many people hate him, for sure--and you have to remember that when you're reading some of these reviews. On the other hand, most of the reviewers seem to be communists themselves, and so their gushing reviews should surprise no one.<br /><br />I recommend the book with some reservations. Agree or disagree, perspectives like Zinn's keep us from becoming ignorant victims of ideological propaganda.<br /><br />I recommend it because it is a great, well-informed, honest and self-conscious dissenting opinion. Anyone who wants to consider themselves educated needs to consider dissenting opinions frequently. But I have reservations. Most importantly, Zinn's purpose is not to introduce someone to American history. He assumes his readers already know the basics. Of course, many people do not. It's not a history of the US; it's a series of contentious corrections to the history traditionally taught in American classrooms. (Why did the Colonies defeat the British? What caused the depression? Why did Nixon visit China? Unless you know this much, this book isn't yet for you.)<br /><br />Some reviewers complained about Zinn's tone. Zinn is an average writer; better than many academics but worse than any good writer.<br />Other reviewers seemed to assume that either communists or far-right conservatives aren't &#34;students of history.&#34; But of course some are. Zinn and Newt Gingrich are both well-informed scholars.<br /><br />(If it matters to you, I am neither communist nor right-wing; I'm just not a political thinker. I'm American, and I think Americans--all of us--can be proud and thankful; but we should recognize that our government and politicians have never been perfect. Ideologies often serve to control people, so dissenting opinions are vital for freedom's perseverance. But democracy and moderated capitalism have often succeeded in blessing their people, while communism has evidently failed everywhere, with more gruesome histories even than capitalism.)alism.)	2003-05-30

I'm only making a note about content.<br />If you've read Pinker's book The Language Instinct and Wright's book The Moral Animal, then you have nothing to gain from this book, except the chapter describing sight. If you are interested in the meaning of life in light of evolution, read The Moral Animal.

I haven't read Holy Transfiguration Monastery's translation of this, but unfortunately it's really hard to find and expensive when you do. Also, I am familiar with Catholic--Orthodox polemics; and I believe I would have noticed a bias if it were evident. Actually I suspect the reviewers, rather than the translator of this edition, had a distorting bias.<br /><br />Please let's leave behind those reviewers and consider the text.<br /><br />The Ladder is certainly a classic of Christian spirituality, especially important in the Greek and Slavic traditions. It was meant to be read by prayerful monks; naturally it is dense compared to the literature we're used to, naturally it's sometimes hard for us to read or understand. The monks' culture and concerns were far different from most of ours; naturally parts of the text are difficult for us to relate to. And yet no one can fail to be challenged by this text--especially we who live in a society that has fully embraced most of the values those monks consciously rejected, and we who attend churches that are often not wise or brave enough to break free of that embrace. It is certainly austere and harsh, and yet the fatherly gentleness and love and wisdom of its author shines through. No one can read this carefully and come away with the common, naive opinion that this work or the spirituality it represents were anything but deeply life-affirming and radically committed to love and justice. No one can read this carefully and come away with their own lifestyle and values unchallenged.<br /><br />&#34;The unexamined life is not worth living.&#34;: Therein lies the value of this text, however difficult it is for us to access at times. I don't care what translation you read, but by all means if you are considering reading, then do! If you actually do find it too difficult to understand or relate to, then begin with Volume One of the Philokalia (ASIN: 0571130135). The introductory essay and the glossary of terms are very, very helpful for understanding Byzantine monastic spirituality and theology shared by Climacus (more helpful than the introductory essay in this edition). After that, you should be able to read the Ladder comfortably.ne monastic spirituality and theology shared by Climacus (more helpful than the introductory essay in this edition).

I was braced for such an experience when I began to read Beowulf. I remembered being completely disinterested when I had to read an excerpt of it in high school.<br />But I was pleasantly surprised. In the first place, Beowulf is short; I was able to read it in an afternoon.<br />Secondly, the translation is very readable and entertaining. A few times I had to read a sentence twice to understand it, but that happens. The translator was definitely a craftsman of the English language.<br />Third, the story is entertaining. It's fun to read. This might not be true of all classic literature! It's an adventure story, and a pleasing one. One reason it was fun to read is that you can feel the pleasures of the heroic values that the poet and his audience shared; in this respect it's similar to what you might experience in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" In fact, the story often reminded me of Tolkien--I confidently guaratee that Tolkien fans will enjoy it. (Tolkien also wrote one of the essays included in this edition.)<br />Fourth, it is interesting to read the oldest \\"English\\" story (of course our language has evolved so much that we now need a translator). The historical interest is much aided by the essays in the Norton Critical edition, including very helpful maps of England and ancient Scandinavia. One interesting aspect of Beowulf is the tension between pre-Christian values and Christian ones within the story as we know it. Again, the essays were interesting and enlightening about this as well.<br />All in all, this is classic literature at its best: readable, highly entertaining, and educational (and short). The essays and maps really were helpful; you won't need to buy the Cliffs Notes to understand or appreciate the text. If you want to read classic literature, I strongly recommend Beowulf; if you want to read Beowulf, I strongly recommend this edition.ion.	2003-05-24

This was perfect.<br />First, the selections included excerpts of almost everything I'd ever heard of: Shang Oracle Bones, the Analects of Confucius and the Confucian classics including the I Ching; Mozi; the Tao Te Ching; Zhuangzi (who famously dreamed that he was a butterfly); Mencius; Xunzi; the Zuozhuan; Sun Tzu's art of war; all kinds of stuff about Chinese schools of Buddhism including the Lotus Sutra and the Flower Garden Sutra and the history of Guanyin and Wutai Shan; Li Po (Li Bo) and Tu Fu (Du Fu); and neo-Confucianism (which was so influential in Korea). In short, this is really, practically the \\"Eatern Canon\\" and the selections are deserving of such a label. I was in turns morally and intellectually challenged, uplifted, informed and surprised; but rarely bored and never disappointed.<br />Second, the introductory essays were exactly what I wanted to know: who might have written it, and when, and who read, and what it meant to them. For all that information, they were still brief and the bibliography was sufficient to help me chase the points that left me curious. An important thing these essays did was to cover the political, historical and social backgrounds (and foregrounds) of the texts, so I learned about Chinese history as well as literature and religion. If that is what you want to do, this book will serve you well.<br />The binding is excellent, and while the price might look steep I have to say it's a bargain considering what you get.<br />I didn't read Volume Two, and so I don't know if it is as good. It is certainly a lot smaller!	2003-05-24

I wanted something profound and challenging from a book with this title, but I only got a few new ideas. The author deals with supernatural concepts rather than all the phenomena of \\"religion.\\" I do not necessarily believe in god, but I think religion generally has depths (transcendent insights) that the author hasn't considered or attempted to explain.<br />Some of the most interesting parts of this book are when the author reviews traditional skeptical arguments skeptically. In other words, he challenges common explanations of belief and usually finds significant problems with them. But he attempts to replace dismissive accounts of religion with a genuinely scientific explanation. Although he doesn't present a religious vision, he certainly isn't passively supporting ordinary skepticism.<br />I can't imagine someone from any major religion losing their faith over this book, although it could challenge beliefs in ghosts, personal messages from god and so on. I think an educated, thoughtful religious person would find his theories less challenging than traditional skeptics.<br />The author is an anthropologist, but he is one of the first in that field to be strongly influenced by sociobiology and cognitive science. If you're familiar with Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, or especially Stephen Pinker, Boyer's theory will sound familiar. Boyer's writing isn't as exciting, and often not as well-organized as theirs, but he makes his case. The book's biggest weakness is that the author doesn't argue some points thoroughly enough. Someone unfamiliar with social psychology might not pick up on the strengths and weaknesses of his arguments. Someone with a good background in anthropology might find some of his perspectives shocking. If you're not familiar with sociobiology and social psychology, you might learn and enjoy more from a book by one of the other authors I mentioned.<br />The bibliography is pretty good.

In fact, it's sort of an explanation for the reason he finds psychology interesting and important: he's trying to discover how to live a meaningful, rewarding life. In this book, he abandons the caution of academic psychology to pursue wisdom; naturally that leaves it with philosophical weaknesses but much greater relevance for life.<br />Csikszentmihalyi's main idea is that if you really try to do something with your time, you'll enjoy life more. It's a pep-talk for doing something rather than nothing. There are a number of very interesting insights in the book, but this is its main point.<br />I've only read a few other self-help books. Although \\"Finding Flow\\" isn't bad, I strongly recommend \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" by M. Scott Peck ahead of it.	2003-03-26

This book briefly covers Korea's religious history from prehistory until the present. It's an interesting story because Korea has always been a unique society: in the ancient past it bred unusual forms of Buddhism; then it was the most Confucian society in history; today it is the only country in Asia to really embrace Protestant Christianity, while at the same time interesting syncretic religions emerge and the shamanist traditions continue.<br />Grayson gives the most important facts and a few interpretations about each of these phenomena; but the book is too brief to go into any depth on any matter. It's a good first book on Korean history and religion, but I constantly wanted to know more than he was telling me. Like me, you'll probably want deeper books after this fine introduction.	2003-03-09

The author clearly knows and cares a lot about Korean shamanism and its art; and he gives a fair coverage of both. But just as clearly he's not a profesional photographer or scholar of religion. I really wanted to know about Korean shamanism and the book was helpful, so even though it's expensive I don't regret buying it at all.

Because of her close association with Thich Nhat Hanh, it is to some degree an informal history of his activities as well. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is her frustration with the American peace movement. Her life (and his) are both quite inspiring, so this is a challenging and uplifting book.

Among historians, Fine is one of the best for several reasons. First, his skepticism and fairness to all the sources stand out: he is not seduced by certain authors or philosophies of history as many are. He acutely perceives the difficulties of historical research. For anyone already interested in the history of Greece, I doubt there could be a better book; if you know a little and want to fill in what you're missing it's a great one too. Plus, it encourages further reading, making you aware of the sources available.<br />I would give two warnings. First, it's dense. It's serious history, directed towards students rather than casual readers. Second, it's not primarily a history of Greek thought and culture except in their broadest outlines. If you want to study the devleopment of ancient philosophy or of Greek art or religion, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if that's all that you're familiar with (this was my situation), it's an excellent coverage of their background.<br />The most surprising aspect of the book, for me, was Fine's wisdom about human nature--without being cynical. I usually think in terms of naive vs. cynical, and Fine is neither. Very refreshing.<br />Finally, I want to mention that the paperback binding of this book is wonderful. Few books have survived the beating my copy took, and still it looks good.	2002-09-22

She doesn't justify him or make excuses for him. But we will only hurt ourselves if we refuse to look honestly at evil in the world, and in ourselves.<br />Besides this, the book is both excellent journalism and excellent history.

I'd always experienced theology as an intellectual struggle, but this book showed me that theology can be a deep, existential experience of God. As it did so, I saw clearly why Orthodox Christianity does not suffer from the theological diseases of the West. Of course, they have their own problems, but theology isn't one of them. In short, this book revolutionized my view and experience of Christianity. Amazingly perhaps, it's had this effect on other people as well.<br />Let me describe some other similar books, to help you find what you're looking for. Ware's book \\"The Orthodox Church\\" introduces Orthodoxy to a Western audience, briefly covering history and some of the more common misunderstandings Westerners have. Though a little dry, it's most people's first book on Orthodoxy. Another very good book by the same author is \\"The Inner Kingdom,\\" a collection of essays on various topics. In it, he doesn't cover the fundamentals of Orthodoxy, but he addresses many issues (such as environmentalism, death, confession and so on) in greater depth. And perhaps the best book on Orthodox theology is Olivier Clement's \\"Roots of Christian Mysticism,\\" which makes the heart and depth of ancient Christian tradition accessible to modern readers. Hopefully one of these books is what you're looking for!<br />(p.s. In case you are wondering, I am not Orthodox.)	2002-06-19

Of course, if you want to study rook endings more generally or less deeply, then this isn't the book for you. &quot;Surviving Rook Endings&quot; probably is--and it is a really good introduction.

Even single pawn endgames can seem so puzzling. However, with a little work even average players can understand this book. I suspect it would be helpful to unusually talented and experienced players as well.<br />I feel that for most player's purposes this book is a little better than Averbach's book, but it's most fun to have them both and compare their explanations. Averbach's book spends far more time on the theory of corresponding squares, while this book is more practical. In short, don't despair if you can't find Averbach's book; this one is very good.<br />If you've read a basic introduction to the endgame, and want to go deeper, this is the next step. All other endgames constantly threaten to reduce to pawn endgames, so these are fundamental concepts. As it says on the back cover, \\"Without an understanding of [pawn endings] it is impossible to master more complicated endings.\\" That is absolutely true.<br />Many players will feel that pawn endgames are boring, but in reality they can be very beautiful. If you learn to enjoy them, then your enjoyment of the entire game of chess will increase.	2002-06-18

It is truly rare for an author to capture the horror of evil so clearly or powerfully. Reading this book is like being beaten up.<br />At the same time, it is about life. Within the tragedy is a story about people facing and overcoming evil. Because it does not look away from the horror, the hope it implies is authentic. Thus this book distinguishes itself.<br />I recommend this book for a mature reader because of its powerful content. It will not leave you unchanged. You will shiver, and think.<br />It is an allegory for the communist takeover of China, and the film that this book inspired won the \\"Golden Bear\\" award. An old, leprous landlord represents the corruption of the Guomingdan period. But his murder enables a young woman to take over, and clean up the winery, representing China. The book shows peasants glorified, a new role for women, the breaking down of class barriers, and a brave struggle against Japanese invaders. All of this must have made it dear to Chinese communists!<br />Perhaps a few Western readers will imagine that all this makes it a less compelling book, however.

Palmer's translation of them is good (he was helped by respected translators Li Rong Rong and Eva Wong) and they are wonderful to read. For this reason, I recommend the book. I've studied Middle Eastern and Central Asian religions for years, and I've become more interested in Chinese religion lately. With this background, the Sutras were completely fascinating. I think the Sutras will inspire edifying, worthwhile reflections in many people.<br />However, Palmer's history is pretty poor. He knows the liberal-ecumenist spin of Christian history, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but in order to present the spin simply he makes some significant factual errors. An earlier reviewer pointed out that the Chinese Christians were a part of the larger Nestorian Church, a fact seriously neglected by Palmer. He makes odd, superficial comparisons between ancient Celtic Christianity and the Chinese Christians. Perhaps worst of all, he repeatedly characterizes the Orthodox Churches (Greek, Russian, Syrian etc.) as Augustinian, which is simply not true--and he does it in order to denigrate them. If he knew what he was talking about, you'd have to say he was malicious. But more likely, he doesn't know what he's talking about, and he's simply made a mistake. In contrast, his interpretation of the Chinese Christians was as flattering as possible. (Again this could be fine, but he should be consistent.) His history of Buddhism is just as contorted; I do not know much about Taoism or Confucianism but I have to suspect he's pretty off there too (even though he's written a couple other books about China). In fairness, he makes all his mistakes with good ecumenical intentions.<br />In short, the Sutras are so good that even the author of the book appreciated them! You will too, although you have to take his commentary and historical accounts lightly. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in the subject.ightest interest in the subject.	2002-01-30

Burkert is a great scholar, and I strongly recommend his book \\"Greek Religion.\\" However, in this book he tries to tie his encyclopedic knowledge of classical cultures to his knowledge of biology (animal behavior), psychology and anthropology. This is an ambitious project, and appropriately, he attempted it for the Gifford Lectures, dedicated to \\"natural theology in the widest sense.\\" He is brave for attempting this when such synthetic descriptions of religion are out of style.<br /><br />However, most of Burkert's connections are too loose to feel convincing. He piles on loads of examples from primarily classical and Near Eastern cultures--neglecting altogether China and India, and most other cultures--but they do not really come together to form a theory or even a series of compelling insights.<br /><br />It was a noble attempt, and he remains a titan in classical studies, and I recommend \\"Greek Religion\\" wholeheartedly.

Their scholarship is poor, their motivations clearly political and their conclusions as biased and unfounded as any faith-perspective has been.<br />But quality reserach has been done in the search for the historical Jesus, and E. P. Sanders is in the front of the march. Sanders is most famous for his &quot;Paul and Palestinian Judaism&quot; which is the most significant study of Paul in the last fifty years. He is a scholar of the highest caliber, even if his publicity is not as great as the JS. Certainly, no one is more qualified to write on this topic.<br />&quot;The Historical Figure of Jesus&quot; is a lay-level introduction to the topic. Sanders does not cover all the issues in the greatest detail, but he economically makes his case in 281 pages. He does neglect some evidence in order to keep it brief. But he does not neglect evidence that would seem challenging to his view, only that which would make his points stronger. In other words, he is a confident scholar, not overly concerned to press an agenda.<br />Sanders' view is that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet, originally a follower of John the Baptist, who was executed because of Caiaphas' fear that he could cause an uprising. This (and the preceeding discussion) may be his only (relatively) direct reference to the Jesus Seminar: &quot;Jesus the thoughtful social and economic planner, who has again become popular, simply cannot be found in the gospels.&quot;<br />Sanders spends several chapters introducing the setting of Jesus' life, and several introducing the sources. About half the book is directly concerned with Jesus' life and teaching. He has an excellent epilogue about the resurrection, and helpful appendices about the chronology of Jesus' life and about his disciples.<br />Sanders knows far more about this topic than he presents here. If you want more depth, consider his &quot;Jesus and Judaism&quot; or &quot;Judaism: Practice and Belief, 63 BCE - 66 CE.&quot; Of course, I recommend his work on Paul even more highly. For evangelical Christians struggling to reconcile their faith with historical scholarship, I recommend the work of N. T. Wright. For Catholics with that problem, Luke Timothy Johnson. Another enlightening book somewhat related to these issues is Jaroslav Pelikan's &quot;Jesus Through the Centuries.&quot;Jesus and Judaism&quot; or &quot;Judaism: Practice and Belief, 63 BCE - 66 CE.&quot; Of course, I recommend his work on Paul even more highly.

Lewis Rambo presents chapters on various aspects of religious conversion, such as social context, religious experience, apostasy, and missionaries. Although he tries to cover many kinds of conversion, inluding intensifying commitment to neglected religious practices, he seems pre-occupied with conversion to monotheistic religions in colonial situations and modern American new religions. He strives to avoid controversy and say as little as possible of significance. For all that, his book is an adequate overview. The main disappointment with his book is the scarcity of studies and examples cited.<br />Personally, I would rather study conversion from the wider perspectives of general changes in religious experiences, commitments, and practices in many cultures. Reading this book, I concluded that the notion of conversion is meaningless in religious studies, one more projection from limited Western experiences onto inappropriate situations in other contexts. In short, I believe the topic is larger than Rambo's coverage. Yet his scholarship, methods and writing are adequate.	2001-10-16

Fred Reed's idea was to write a travel narrative of his quest to learn about Said Nursi, an Islamic dissident who still has an active following 50 years after his death. Said Nursi is a fascinating man deserving a fascinating study: Reed's scholarship is fine, but his book fails miserably.<br />I could barely get through his writing, despite my determination to finish the book. Full of ironic pretensions to omniscience, with the self-pity and self-doubt that characterizes impotent intellectuals, Reed's writing could put out small fires. He is paranoid and suspicious, and his writing full of quickly withdrawn implications. Preoccupied with displaying his cleverness, he fails to take anything seriously.<br />If you want to learn about Said Nursi and his followers, I don't know of a better source, and that is a sad statement.

His words have blessed many thousands of people in many traditions. I especially recommend this one.<br />Although Nouwen was a Roman Catholic priest, in this book he explores Eastern Orthodox spirituality, teaching us how to pray with icons. His teaching, from an Orthodox perspective, is doctrinally sound and very insightful. The book has four secions, one for each of the icons: The Holy Trinity (a famous icon by St. Andrei Rublev--see the movie), the Virgin of Vladimir (a beautiful icon painted by St. Luke the Evangelist, according to legend), the Savior of Zvenigorod (also by Rublev), and Pentecost. The icons are reproduced beautifully on fold-out portions at each end of the book, so that you can read and ponder the icons simultaneously.<br />If icons are to you just pictures or religious decorations, this book will teach how to look more deeply, to see the spiritual significance of their details, to see the Gospel in their art. You will, if you are willing, naturally be led to pray and to receive them as revelations of spiritual reality. But if you are skeptical, perhaps from an iconoclast tradition, at least you will begin to understand why icons are so precious in Orthodox tradition.	2001-10-03

I think Abbey was one of the early voices in modern environmentalism, and this is a classic book in that field. I appreciate his desert and his writing; even if you are not an environmentalist nor a lover of the desert, you may see why people are if you read this.

I bought this on September 11th--barely beating the rush, and read it immediately. Now it is in demand, and maybe hard to get. But persevere, buy it and read it: it is a great book. It explains so much about Central Asian and Middle Eastern politics, NGOs, international competition for oil, the drug industry, smuggling, terrorism, al-Qaeda, and the origins of the Afghan refugee problem that bothers Iran, Pakistan, Thailand and Australia so much. If you know nothing about these things, this book explains them without assuming much prior knowledge; but if you are an expert I suspect you will still learn a few things.<br />The book covers from the Cold War until the year 2000; it obviously does not talk about the recent death of the opposition's leader or the ramifications of the attack on America. It does explain a little of Afghanistan's ancient and medieval history and culture as well.<br />People have asked me what the author's slant is; I honestly don't know. Although he does tell about American policies, it is not ... especially anti-American or anti-Western; nor is it anti-Arab, anti-Islam, anti-Iranian, anti-Soviet or -Russian, or anti-Pakistan.

But many people hate him, for sure--and you have to remember that when you're reading some of these reviews. On the other hand, most of the reviewers seem to be communists themselves, and so their gushing reviews should surprise no one.<br />I recommend the book with some reservations. Agree or disagree, perspectives like Zinn's keep us from becoming ignorant victims of ideological propaganda.<br />I recommend it because it is a great, well-informed, honest and self-conscious dissenting opinion. Anyone who wants to consider themselves educated needs to consider dissenting opinions frequently. But I have reservations. Most importantly, Zinn's purpose is not to introduce someone to American history. He assumes his readers already know the basics. Of course, many people do not. It's not a history of the US; it's a series of contentious corrections to the history traditionally taught in American classrooms. (Why did the Colonies defeat the British? What caused the depression? Why did Nixon visit China? Unless you know this much, this book isn't yet for you.)<br />Some reviewers complained about Zinn's tone. Zinn is an average writer; better than many academics but worse than any good writer.<br />Other reviewers seemed to assume that either communists or far-right conservatives aren't &quot;students of history.&quot; But of course some are. Zinn and Newt Gingrich are both well-informed scholars.<br />(If it matters to you, I am neither communist nor right-wing; I'm just not a political thinker. I'm American, and I think Americans--all of us--can be proud and thankful; but we should recognize that our government and politicians have never been perfect.

It covers the gods and the basic myths, the Horus-Isis-Osiris myths, the cult of the Pharoahs, spells and amulets of protection and healing and fertility, beliefs about the afterlife, and the spread of Egyptian religion in classical times. The illustrations are very helpful, and I feel I have learned from this book the basic elements of Egyptian iconography. I have also learned the basic significance of the main Egyptian gods and goddesses. Quirke is very good at identifying common misperceptions and correcting them. I recommend this book to people who are curious about the basics of Egyptian religion as well as to people who are travelling to Egypt and want to prepare themselves for the sights and museums. Unfortunately, it doesn't cover history or archaeology very well--i.e. it moves thematically rather than chronologically, and doesn't describe the main temples or ruins--and it can get a little dense in the middle. If you're more interested in history or archaeology than in fertility amulets, maybe there's a better book.<br />I haven't read &quot;The Search for God in Ancient Egypt&quot; by Jan Assmann, but I hear it's important for people who want to understand Egyptian religion.	2001-09-08

He records interviews revealing the sorrows, superstitions, and enduring faith of Middle Eastern Christians. For me, some highlights included his accounts of the Turoyo speaking Surianis, the chant of the Urfalees, and modern Alexandria.<br />I wish he did a better job of presenting the situations of other groups--Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Jews, Shiis, the Hezbollah, without accounts of their history it's easier to demonize them. I wish he had gone a little more out of his way to correct Western perceptions of Islam.

Serbians did commit genocide and other horrible atrocities in Bosnia, and Serbian Orthodox clergy and laity played parts in these both implicitly and explicitly. The sanctification and legend of Prince Lazar played a part in the justifications and mentality of the Serbs as well. However, Sells systematically ignores the Serbian church's frequent and often dangerous resistance to the wars and genocide. He has a remarkable ignorance of the history of the Balkans before Tito. Finally he overestimates the significance of the Lazar myth in the Serb's actions: not all nationalistic myths produce large-scale genocide!<br /><br />Sells barely veils his hostility toward religion (not only Serbian Orthodoxy), and although the events are tragic and terrifying, I hope we value clear thought and honesty more than Michael Sells.

It does provide an easy-to-understand and not inaccurate account of quantum theory and relativity theory. Zukav is also correct to point out that these theories, especially quantum theory, helped free intellectuals from the chains of mechanistic determinism. He goes much further than this, and he quietly acknowledges that he is going beyond scientific theories.<br /><br />People who like Deepak Chopra might enjoy Zukav, because the latter is scientifically more careful. But if anyone is really interested in well-explained theoretical physics, without pseudo-scientific and superficial mysticism, Brian Greene's book is better.

It features the standard important monuments, such as Angkor Wat and Borobodur, as well as lesser known sites like Sagaing, Burma or Si Satchanalai, Thailand. Altogether 38 sites are covered. Three unfortunate omissions are Mount Tai Shan and the Temple of Heaven in China, and Shikoku island in Japan. Perhaps something from Bhutan would have been nice as well. I find its coverage of ancestor woship and Shinto lacking.<br /><br />If the book has an obvious, glaring weakness, it is the absence of Islamic sites. Islam has been influential in the East, so even if not considered an Eastern religion it has interesting Eastern manifestations--for instance the Taj Mahal. Its absence is at least as unfortunate as the inadequate coverage of ancestor worship.<br /><br />I am obviously rather picky, but for the price and the photograph quality, this is a first-rate bargain, and might well spark someone's interest in travel or further reading--the ultimate value of any coffee-table book.	2001-08-27

This book outlines an excellent journey from Istanbul to Cairo, with all the detail and information we expect from Lonely Planet. The only problem emerges if you want to take a different route than the one they've outlined. They make hardly any allowance for this possibility, and this is the book's fatal flaw. Use it as a suggestion book, as a guide; but consider buying a guide to the Middle East instead, and thus providing yourself with much more information on the places between Istanbul and Cairo, places you may want to visit even though they're &quot;off the beaten track.&quot; For instance, with more information I chose to go South through Jordan, ferry to Egypt, and then go back North into Israel, ending in Jerusalem. This made sites such as Petra in Jordan and St. Anthony's Monastery in Egypt fit nicely on the itinerary, and for me ending in Jerusalem provided a more fitting climax. No one trip can fit everyone. Whatever your desires, consider a guidebook that presents more options. Make sure you include Istanbul, Ephesus, Damascus, Baalbek, Beirut, Petra, Jerusalem, Cairo. Strongly consider Nazareth, Haifa, Luxor, and Mt. Sinai. Have fun!	2001-08-27

Now that it has been done, hopefully it will go out of style.<br /><br />Literary theory, Chinese philosophy, and post-modern Western philosophy (which itself has a pre-occupation with literary theory) are Gao Xingjian's primary concerns in this book. His characters are I, he, she, and you. I creates you so that I am not lonely, and together you and I create he and she. But you and I trade places in the middle of the story. Although this reviewer is not bright enough to figure out what all of this is supposed to mean, for me it was about the fantasy lives so many of us live to avoid ourselves. The story itself wasn't hard to follow. As an uncondemning look at our mental worlds and fantasies, it is a successful, interesting, thought-provoking story.<br /><br />I read it because I am interested in Chinese culture. The characters encounter various scholars and religious figures in their plotless adventures, and these encounters are a bit of a glimpse into China as Xingjian remembers it. Some familiarity with Chinese geography and religion will help readers.<br /><br />The book caused a bit of a controversy in China for its sexual content. But in a Western context, it is unremarkable in this respect.<br /><br />I ranked it so low, not because of its literary pre-occupations, but because it is very slow and hard to read. It doesn't pull a reader along. Perhaps in Chinese it resembles poetry; certainly there are some beautiful passages even in translation. Certainly some can inspire rich philosophical reflection. People who like to read and think hard about their reading will like this novel. People who desire entertainment will find it too heavy.	2001-08-25

He is therefore an authority on Orthodox teachings.<br />His primary concern in this book is to remind Orthodox faithful of the divine origin of their Church and its hierarchy. It probably serves this purpose well, writted in a sermon-like style that might make good preaching but is terrible writing. He constantly cites sentence fragments of scripture. Many of his sentences bear several clauses too many, pronouns with mysterious antecedents, and brutal pious adjectives. This creates a feeling of disorganization or confusion, but I think the reader is supposed to get a sense of the profound force of authority in the words. Sometimes he uses parallelism to dramatic effect.<br />However, the author faithfully represents traditional Orthodox doctrine. In addition to the frantic citation of scripture, he frequently quotes Augustine and Theophan the Recluse at length. He takes for granted the identity of the Orthodox Church as the subject of the scriptural texts and traditional teachings. He hints at Orthodox responses to the doctrines of other churches, but does not confront them directly. He also seems unaware of the surprise a citizen of a pluralistic society must feel when told that holiness does not exist outside the Eastern Orthodox Church. He does not address it, at any rate.<br />In short, this book was not at all what I was looking for when I began reading it. If you are looking for something more well-written and influential, consider Khomiakov's &quot;The Church is One.&quot;	2001-08-21

These are basically the most famous meditation instructors in Myanmar (Burma), Thailand and Laos. If you want to learn about Theravada meditation, either for scholarly reasons or to practice, you can't do better than this book without learning their languages.<br />However, I think it represents a sort of elite perspective on Theravada Buddhism. Many practitioners don't share exactly the spiritualities expressed by these teachers, and I think their practices and beliefs (some would say superstitions) are an important and valuable part of Theravada Buddhism, not to be neglected by either scholars or practioners.	2001-08-02

Unfortunately, I don't know of a good book for that purpopse, although I've looked around both in Vietnam and the United States.

Joe Cummings is very insightful, and I enjoy his guidebooks (also Thailand and Laos). It's very easy to travel in Myanmar, so you barely need a guidebook. But I met a couple who were traveling without one, and without any other prior knowledge evidently. It seemed to me that they missed a lot, they had no idea what they were seeing, or what people were talking to them about.<br />Some of the maps aren't exactly accurate, unfortunately. But they're good enough.<br />Some people hesitate to visit Myanmar because Aung San Suu Kyi has asked people not to support the current government. Actually, visiting Burma helps people a lot, financially and politically. The government is sensitive to foreign opinions. Further, many industries (such as hotels, bus companies and two airlines) have been privatised, so you don't have to support the government at all. But you can get locals in trouble, so keep that in mind if you're used to countries with nearly free-speech.<br />I think Bago is very under-rated by this guidebook. Spend a day exploring the city with a English speaking guide, and another day visiting the Golden Rock Pagoda on Mt. Kyiaktiyo. These were my two best days in Myanmar. Also, eat from the street stalls; the food is better and it's more fun. Do your best to attend at Nat-Pwe, usually they have one somewhere every week-end. Visit the smaller, more peaceful pagodas in Bagan. Get used to long, punishing, brutal bus rides. And have a great time in a beautiful, hospital, wonderful country!	2001-08-02

Like most Christans, and perhaps many Jews, I had mumbled over these psalms uncomfortably, and quickly forgot them. But this book helped me tremendously to appreciate and value these psalms, and some of them have become rather important to me. Zenger discusses the psalms as laments against violence and injustice, and he discusses how we can use these psalms in our own prayer.<br />A professor of Old Testament Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary wrote that this book was the &quot;most extensive and best work that I know of on one of the most troubling dimensions of scripture... With both careful and rich exegesis of the psalms... Zenger recovers these as important liturgical and theological resources...&quot;<br />If these Psalms, and the classic image of the wrathful Old Testament God, have disturbed you, and you want to integrate them productively into your spirituality, this is an excellent book for you.	2001-08-02

Cao Dai is a fascinating religion, and this is one evidence of it. It includes a conversation between the spirit of Victor Hugo and a Cao Dai leader in 1930, illustrations of symbolic hand gestures and other symbols, common prayers and vows, and Hum Dac Bui's presentation of Cao Dai philosophy. In short, it is an incredible primary source. But if you want an outside perspective, look elsewhere. I've heard that Victor Oliver's book &quot;Caodai Spiritism&quot; is good, but I haven't read it. Joyce Werner's &quot;Peasant Politics and Religious Sectarianism&quot; is a Yale doctoral thesis, an account of the spread and popularity of Cao Dai. Graham Greene considered converting to Cao Dai but became disillusioned; he gives his interesting, humorous perspective in &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; which I recommend for literary reasons as well.	2001-08-02

His spirituality had deep, Hindu roots, which he explained in many writings. This book is excerpts of those writings, arranged by subject. In the introduction we are told of an incident where a politician told Gandhi that they were both men of God. Gandhi replies, &quot;You are a politician disguised as a man of God. I am a man of God disguised as a politician.&quot; The truth of that statement comes out in his writings.<br />&quot;It is the duty of every human being to look carefully within and see himself as he is, and spare no pains to improve himself in body, mind and soul. He should realize the mischief wrought by injustice, wickedness, vanity and the like, and do his best to fight them.&quot;<br />His life is an example, despite his imperfections, and his teachings are a reliable guide.

Thunberg's works, &quot;Microcosm and Mediator&quot; and the shorter, more accessible &quot;Man and the Cosmos&quot; are the best English works on Maximus (perhaps the best in any language).

But many people hate him, for sure--and you have to remember that when you're reading some of these reviews. On the other hand, most of the reviewers seem to be communists themselves, and so their gushing reviews should surprise no one.<br /><br />I recommend the book with some reservations. Agree or disagree, perspectives like Zinn's keep us from becoming ignorant victims of ideological propaganda.<br /><br />I recommend it because it is a great, well-informed, honest and self-conscious dissenting opinion. Anyone who wants to consider themselves educated needs to consider dissenting opinions frequently. But I have reservations. Most importantly, Zinn's purpose is not to introduce someone to American history. He assumes his readers already know the basics. Of course, many people do not. It's not a history of the US; it's a series of contentious corrections to the history traditionally taught in American classrooms. (Why did the Colonies defeat the British? What caused the depression? Why did Nixon visit China? Unless you know this much, this book isn't yet for you.)<br /><br />Some reviewers complained about Zinn's tone. Zinn is an average writer; better than many academics but worse than any good writer.<br />Other reviewers seemed to assume that either communists or far-right conservatives aren't &#34;students of history.&#34; But of course some are. Zinn and Newt Gingrich are both well-informed scholars.<br /><br />(If it matters to you, I am neither communist nor right-wing; I'm just not a very political thinker. I'm American, and I think Americans--all of us--can be proud and thankful; but we should recognize that our government and politicians have never been perfect.

John Baillie was an Anglican theologian (edit: I've been informed that he was actually a Scottish Presbyterian theologian), and evidently not a bad one. But his greatest work was this compilation of prayers. It is arranged into prayers for each morning and evening of 31 days, plus extra prayers for Sundays. The odd-numbered (right-side) pages have the prayers, while the even-numbered pages are empty for your own notes. The prayers are a combination of ancient prayers, various Christian liturgies, Scripture, and Baillie's own writing. It is written in elegant King James English, but it is certainly accessible to anyone who can read.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough for anyone, in any Christian tradition, wanting to grow in prayer.

Even though he is a monk, he understands our struggles.<br />I only gave it four stars, because I am very picky and reserve five stars for only the very, very best books (such as Kallistos Ware's The Inner Kingdom).<br />Here are a few quotes from the essays. There is much more in the book than this, of course. I've chosen them hoping to tempt you to read the book!<br />&quot;Selfish love for our neighbor, a bad love of our self, approaching others to avoid our own existential questions--all intensify our loneliness until it becomes a virtual prison.&quot;<br />&quot;The Orthodox spiritual tradition has a legacy of holiness and, when followed authentically, exhibits a way of life that is dangerous.&quot;<br />&quot;Serious obstacles to prayer are too much sleep, too much food, too much talk, and luxurious living.&quot;<br />&quot;As there is no healthy plant without roots, there can be no life of prayer without the sacraments, especially Holy Eucharist.&quot;<br />&quot;The greatest tragedy, worse even than any sin, is boasting over false holiness.&quot;<br />&quot;When we speak of submission or obedience we do not mean a condition of slavery lacking in freedom, or a condition of fear burdened with the gloom of sterile dutifulness. The relationship of man with God in the Holy Spirit is cultivated to bloom in an atmosphere of exceptional freedom, absolute confidence, willingness and love.&quot;<br />&quot;A wise man of recent history has said the following words... 'I love Christ, but the Christians I do not love because they do not resemble Christ' (Ghandi). I think he is right. Many times, more than the so-called atheists, it is we Christians who denigrate the name of Christ and provoke... the blaspheming of his holy name.&quot;<br />&quot;Christ will leave us in our darkness if we prefer to remain there, but he will always and in every circumstance anticipate our repentance.&quot;<br />&quot;Christ remains unknown even to the Christians. There is an urgent need to re-evangelize the Christians. There is need for intense effort and struggle.&quot;a condition of fear burdened with the gloom of sterile dutifulness.

Father Alexander Schmemann is one of the greatest theologians and teachers America has ever known, and he was very open in these journals. They are a valuable look into the heart of a great man. His honest desciption of his vision of the ecclesiastical world, his own failings, and the realities of seminary life may be eye-opening to some, perhaps even discouraging. But his tenderness and sensitivity to the world saturate almost every page, and his rich wisdom and deep faith will challenge every reader. Here is the spiritual life of an authentically human Orthodox Christian.	2000-11-08

The icons are beautiful and well-chosen, his commentary is accurate and often challenging, and the liturgical texts speak for themselves. No one can understand Orthodoxy without understanding the main feasts, and this is a great introduction to them. Of course ultimately you have to celebrate the feasts with the Church in order to understand them fully. All Christians, especially Orthodox, will benefit from reading this book.	2000-11-08

The authors and perspectives are overwhelmingly Sufi, and strain to present mystical Islam in Christian terms.  They generally also represent modernist Islam, assimilated to Western ideas.  So this isn't mainstream Islam.  But if that's what you're interested in, this is a great book.  Of course some essays are better than others, but overall it's a good read.  I learned a lot.<br /><br />Edit - here we are, about 6 years later, and I understand what this book is. Nasr is not a normal Muslim, nor are any of the contributors to this \\"study.\\" They are \\"Traditionalists,\\" followers of Rene Guenon. You can read about traditionalism in Sedgwick's \\"Against the Modern World.\\" What this means is that this is a great book if you want to study \\"Traditionalist Spirituality,\\" but not if you want to study Islam. Let me recommend Reza Aslan's \\"No God but God\\" if you haven't studied Islam much and are just curious. If you want a better introduction to Sufism, consider books by Henri Corbin (also a traditionalist, but more faithful to his declared subjects). There are lots of others of course.	2000-10-14
