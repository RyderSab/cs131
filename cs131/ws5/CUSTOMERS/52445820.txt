This engaging story of a young boy coming of age in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia is simply a delightful gem of fine writing.  Michael Chisholm simply glows with realistic pubescence with all the humor and aching that can bring.  His brothers, sister, parents, along with all the other aptyly portrayed Cape Bretonners, remind this writer so much of his own late boyhood and of the time spent on Cape Breton near the titular tar ponds.  Beyond the underlying theme of death and loss, the novel also speaks volumes regarding the ecological equipoise of the steel mills, the coal mines, and national pride.  Campbell's descriptions of the cityscape of Sydney are also spot on and make this writer long to visit that city again.  Gaspereau Press has packaged this delightful book attractively as well.  Canadiana at its sparkling best.	2005-06-02

While not lacking at all in imagination and fanciful storytelling, this first (and self-published) novel suffers from syntactical and stylistic problems which more careful editing would readily address.  While I look forward to seeing how writer Crowell develops in his further TRUE ADVENTURES, I would just recommend that anyone who tries this book and enjoys it, should also try Patricia McKillip, Robin McKinley, Terry Brooks, and of course, Tolkien for similar stories, told by sublimely silken prose stylists.	2004-11-08
US	52445820	R3VNNXXWF2YOR1	0446529818	274633509	Night Blooming	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Vampires and Stigmata	This series never fails to enthrall with its fastidious attention to historical detail and its equally charming vampire hero.  It's really quite amazing how subtly and so casually author Yarbro deals with the mundanities of vampirism, which never gets in the way of the plot or the history.   Saint-Germain himself just gets better all the time.  What a fabulous character, created from a bit of history himself!  The supporting cast -- his manservant, his former-lover-turned-best-vamp-bud, and her charming and witty ghoul amanuensis --- are so well developed throughout the series, they now seem like old friends.  Admittedly, Anne Rice and her Lestat, worthy of praise and adultation, tend to overshadow the more quiet seduction of Yarbro and S-G; that seems a bit unfair, but then this kind of historical fiction does not appeal to everyone.  If you love Rice, you should though at least give Yarbro a try.  The same is true for fans of Laurell Hamilton, whom this writer finds to be an acquired taste which just hasn't happened for him yet, if ever.   NIGHT BLOOMING is a superb additon to the S-G chronicles.	2004-11-08

This beautiful mission, set so graciously against the mountains near Tucson, is an inspiration in its beauty and simple spirituality, which pervades. <br />Itule's novel walks the line between respectful description and consumerist exploitation with care and grace.  His journalism work serves him well with strong narrative skills and a well-honed sense of pacing.  His characters are strong; the women particularly so, and well drawn. <br />The descriptive passages dealing with the mission are apt and inviting, not only to those who've never been to del Bac, but to those of us who long to return.   <br />As with so many contemporary novels, there is a bit of sexuality between a couple of the characters and indeed, sex plays an important role in the actual mystery.  While this reviewer could do without any overt sex scenes, author Itule handles them well and without prurience.	2004-10-18

Not only is author Whitewolf chock to the brim with creative concepts and fun,  he's a competent storyteller and has a firm grasp of plot, pacing, and other narrative tricks essential to good stories. <br /> <br />The book does suffer though from a lack of strong editing.  Aside from cramming way too much into one book, there are numerous unforgiveable grammatical errors (most noticeably \\"it's/its\\" confusion) and the short, choppy sentences and minimal paragraphing are annoying and distracting to the reader.  When writing for young people, attention to such details is even more vital. <br /> <br />I'd loved to see what a talented editor might do with this talented author.	2004-10-18

Just the thought makes me drown in the shear yumminess.   This is a very fun book, written with wit and sensuality and lovely, lovely longing.  While this in no way compromises the joy of a book in which the descriptions of food easily overwhelm not only readers, but the characters as well, those same characters do become ever so slightly tedious late in the book.   But read on!  There are near-recipes right through to the end.  The writer looks forward to further food fables from author Capella, who demonstrates influences from Garcia Marquez, Allende, Esquival, Lily Prior, and Joanne Harris, all of whose readers would readily enjoy this book.	2004-10-05

Stylistically, this first book in Nimmo's series is not nearly as smooth and sophisticated as the Potter oeuvre, but kids aren't going to worry about that.  The book and likely the series, are a grand romp and the story moves.  Only we adults who quibble about the literary quality our kids are experiencing would show the least concern here.	2004-09-30

While brighter and somewhat less acidic than Lemony Snicket's unfortunate oeuvre, the characters herein soar not only in Peter Pan-esque bravado and elan, but also in smartly targeting right on its turgid mark.  When combined, a haunted library, completed with way quirky librarians; a family where eccentricity and egomania are a long-standing and requisite condition, and lots of goofy fun weirdness make for an incredible reading experience.  While this would be a great addition to the \\"while we're waiting for the next Potter/Snicket/Funke/Paolini, etc.\\" list, there's a lot here for reluctant readers and generally fans of the kooky.  This would also be great for classroom use in teaching the joys of satire.	2004-09-23

Throw in the Mouse Police that never sleep, the Lilliputians and Thumbelina, and a flying monkey serving temporarily as a mayor and what a fun, rollicking romp through archetypes and the collective unconsciousness.

Yes, author Paolini uses all of the beloved elements of fantasy here, but this is no mere Tolkien or McCaffrey or Brooks pastiche.  As its most essential, ERAGON is a story about power.  Those who have it; those who want it; those who feel entitled to take it; and sadly, those who abuse it.  How startlingly amazing that at fifteen, this writer was able to see, let alone describe in elegant and poignant prose, so clearly this concept that so fascinates and drives humanity!  The business and self-help sections of our libraries and bookstores are filled with the literature of power; interested readers should also check out the young adult fiction section as well.  Readers who enjoy Paolini would also likely devour Anne McCaffrey, Tamora Pierce, Patricia McKillip, and of course, Brooks and Tolkien.	2004-03-04

P. Lovecraft.  This &quot;may have been/could have been&quot; pseudo-biography of Lovecraft provides deliciously horrid explanations for why Lovecraft's life went the way it did.  From his bizarre childhood in which his mother insisted on dressing him as a girl to the difficulties he had in maintaining personal relationships, the authors unceasingly engage with word and pictures in this excellent example of what the graphic novel should be.  An astounding, if unsettling work.  Readers of Jonathon Scott Fuqua's IN THE SHADOW OF EDGAR ALLAN POE will also enjoy this.	2004-02-20

There are the usual wonderful extended metaphors, the droll, yet humane humor, and the rich characterizations that pervade her growing oeurve.  While readers would also enjoy the Adult Fairy Tale series, edited by Terri Windling, and the Fairy Tales for Adults anthologies from Windling and Datlow (to which I believe McKillip contributes), no other author does it as well at McKillip.

MZB chose well in making Deborah Ross heir to her rich Darkover literary legacy and DJR does her predecessor proud in this rich and engaging novel.   How uncanny it seems when Ross develops her plots and characters using techniques of which MZB was unequivably the mistress!   This and it's sister and prequel THE FALL OF NESKAYA add much to the vivid and always enchanting world.   Reviewers elsewhere stated that while this would be eagerly embraced by Darkover fans, it would fail to attract new readers.  Not so!  Indeed, the quick-moving plot and lush details would serve well as an introduction to one of the most long-lived fantasy series.   However, the proofreading and editing here lack miserably.  Frankly, I expect better from DAW Books and, as a college English professor, was appalled at the mistakes even my weakest Freshman Comp students would catch in a moment.	2003-06-24

No more feud with the Warleggans.  Although Graham easily has material for a whole new generation of Poldarks, apparently this is the last one.  Fortunately, there's a ton of Poldark books to go back and start reading again.  I can't wait.<br />There's such a true sense of place in this series; Cornwall in the 17th/18th century is alive and so appealing.  The characters are appealing, even as they appall, like Ross's enemy George Warleggan.<br />The PBS series was grand too, but the books are better.  Such a diverting relief from too much war TV.<br />If you like the very different novels of Daphne du Maurier or, even more distinctly, the veterinary tales of James Herriot in Yorkshire, you'll find something to like here.	2003-04-15

Probably just as well too, because I'd probably not have appreciated du Maurier's exquisite mastery of suspense-building.  Most of her novels are definite page-turners, keeping the reader firmly with grasp; this work not only grasps, it gropes!.  Memorable characters, even if not particularly loveable ones.

Hoffman's third short novel marketed to the young adult audience has appeal far beyond the angstful teen readers for whom it was likely written.  This is more prose poem than novel, although there is a typically twisty-turny-quirky Hoffman plot that satisfies deeply.   The deft use of archetypal/fairy tale/mythological concepts resonate the text on many levels.   But language is the essence here: pure, poetic, lyrically luminous and unnervingly numinous.

KCH is a sublime authority on the Anglo-Saxon and a talented fabulist as well.   His characters are engaging, even when they're busy being less than wonderful and the plot twists and turns, even though the storyline rings with familiarity.   This take on the Matter of Britain is different and by the end of this first of a proposed trilogy, the reader still isn't entirely sure where it'll all end up, but that just makes 'em want the next volume all the more.   Not just for the 'tween-agers it's been marketed to; another fine holiday or anytime read.   Intriguing prose style and narrative techniques.	2002-12-29

Reading Dragon Stories from Anne McCaffrey is a delight anytime, but especially so during the holidays.   Her prose, always so smooth and humanely warm, shimmers in the holiday glow.   Such a pleasure to read again about Keevan, the smallest dragonboy, and Aramina, the girl who heard dragons, and then to meet new charmers like Tenna, the runner and Nian and Neru, the dragon-riding twins.   McCaffrey is an absolute master of characterization, but never at the slighting of plot.  The pages here turn much too fast.   It seems SO long since the last dragon novel.

Honestly, the reviewers for the professional library journals can be so pompous!  Gaiman absolutely has a handle on his audience in this and all his incredible ouevre.   The characterizations here are marvelous and so right on regarding contemporary suburban families.   The plot too, as always with Gaiman, is a page-turner from start to the comes-too-quickly end.  But the best thing about this book, which will appeal to the Potterphiles and Snicketites, is that it is so well-written and consummately literary in its myriad allusions to other dark fantasy, fairy tales, and film; the text literally resonates!   A good introduction to Neil Gaiman (lucky stiffs! what wonders await!) or a new favorite for longtime fans.	2002-12-16

Terri Windling's Fairy Tale Series never disappoints.   Author Frost here creates a vivid and accurate, if bleakly creepy milieu for his take on Bluebeard.   The millennial fervor of mid-19th century America is fascinating in itself and Frost elucidates as he entertains.   His characterizations are apt, although I was at first discomifited by his descriptions of the sexual de-flowering of his three protagonists; eventually, it all fits and is entirely appropriate.   The story of Bluebeard has always been an ugly for me and it's no less so in this re-telling.   Some very engaging and aptly retro prose.	2002-12-16

The mysterious author with the citrusy name is certainly to be admired for his endless cleverness.   Continuing the oh-so unlucky tale of the Baudelaire orphans with the same wickedly awful humor and page-turning plots, the no-more fortunate Mr. Snicket unceasingly contrives to not only entertain his young (and not-so-young) audiences, but to also teach them a bit here and there about language and semantics in an entirely nasty fun way.   The popularity of this series in no way surprises and most definitely delights this cranky ol' children's librarian to no small end.  Thank goodness the Lemony One is more prolific than the Potter Word-Wizard, so we, especially the 'tweeny-boppers among us, have some great reading while waiting.

The challenges of translating comic book icons into literate fiction are enormous, but Louise Simonson here proves more than merely adept at meeting the situation.   Simonson obviously is well aware of the tremendous backstory to not just her protagonist, Wonder Woman, but also of Jack Kirby's New Gods/Darkseid/Apokolips franchise.  She, while remaining consummately respectful of these characters and their formidable history, is not afraid to play a bit with it and make the characters her own.   How delightful it might be if she were to take on the Amazing Amazon's monthly series!   Not only are the characterizations apt and appropriate, her plot keeps the pages turning.  This series is a strong addition to the growing body of 'tweenage fiction.   Better written than the loathsome Junie B. Jones series and a bit more sophisticated than the rudely humorous Captain Underpants,  these belong in all library collections.  Not just for comics fans either, although Justice League and especially Wonder Woman lovers will not be disappointed and perhaps the books will inspire non-comics readers to pick up some additional great material in this much-beloved, if oft maligned format.	2002-11-24

At the very worst in such works as VIOLIN, BLOOD AND GOLD, THE VAMPIRE ARMAND, and PANDORA, Anne Rice writes in a lush, lovely, lyrical prose, which while beautiful, fails in these books to sing.   BLACKWOOD FARM is the virtuoso aria of America's diva of the vampiric and witchy. This is Anne Rice at her most masterful and is likely her best-written work to date.   The incredible prose has never been more refined and sophisticated, laden with delightful allusion and sumptuous metaphor; the new characters are grand and loving and lovely; there's just a tantalizing toss of old characters; and the plot keeps you turning those pages, all 530 of them.

When traveling, the Fodor's and Frommer's and Roughs and AAA guides are all invaluable in different ways, but it so nice to have a personal look from a nearly-native.  Even better yet, to have it delivered in the elegant prose of a superb writer.  While this, and its sister-in-series, AFTER THE DANCE by Edwidge Danticat, are quick mind candy for the armchair traveler, I can't imagine a trip to P'town (or Danticat's smalltown Haiti during Carnival) without these compact volumes.   Cunningham lovingly, but unflinchingly reveals a Provincetown that is not merely a hedonistic gay play-place, but the home of tolerance and compassion that's supposed to be the USA.   What better place to be so than the Mayflower pilgrims' first landfall in their brave new world.  Very much looking forward to the rest of this series from Crown.	2002-10-29

Not a lot of Harris' special blend magical realism here, but her prose is as lush and elegantly lyrical as in all her past works.  Her exploration of the metaphorical sea, ocean, salt water, etc. is an enchantment to read.  I was particularly awed by the amazing similarities between COASTLINERS and a couple of recent Maine novels, ERNIE'S ARK by Monica Wood and THE WOODEN NICKEL by William Carpenter.   Harris' characters on their French island could readily swap places with the salty, earthy, gutsy folk who populate the not-so fictional Maine coast of Wood and Carpenter, likely even recognizing kindred spirits.   Even if this is somewhat of a departure for Harris, it's still as grand a reading experience as CHOCOLAT or FIVE QUARTERS OF THE ORANGE.	2002-10-26

The use of Stephen Phillips' lovely quirky photography and Steven Parke's endlessly creative artistic expression to enhance Jon Fuqua's quietly insightful tale of what was really going on with Poe is a dark and blissful marriage, as bothersomely beautiful as Poe's own to cousin Virginia.  Edgar, Auntie Maria, and cuz Virginia brought worlds of new meaning to the concept of menage a trois.  This story unflinchingly examines and displays the seamiest aspects of Poe's morally equivocal, but endlessly fascinating and brilliant life.   Fans of PREACHER, HELLBLAZER, and Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN will find much to love here as well.  This belongs in every public library collection for young adults and in any collection of American literary history.  The best part is that the demons who plague Poe are portrayed in such a way as the reader still can never be quite sure if they are real and separate beings or just Poe's absinthe-soaked delusions.  Masterfully rendered.	2002-10-16

Although more concerned with smell than with taste, as in her first novel, LA CUCINA, she does include a rather scrumptious feast of words in a chapter or two.  Sensation is everything here and the sparkling and lively tale is amazingly delicious, delectable, and drolly naughty.  Ramona, our decidedly unpleasant heroine, delights even as she disgusts.

Lackey does a superb job as she has with the earlier FIRE ROSE.   Her characters are always interesting and the plots do not fail to keep you turning pages until a satisfying end.   What is particularly appealing about this book is the exquisite attention to the minutiae of life in Devonshire at the turn of the last century.  Some folks really don't seem to care or are even irritated by such detailing, but for this reviewer, the fine points are what make an otherwise rich tapestry flame to brilliant life.   This is a fine addition to the ever-growing list of fairy tale re-visionings and to Lackey's impressive and massive oeuvre.	2002-10-02

Following brilliantly in the romantic, senusal writing styles of Laura Esquivel, Isabel Allende, and Joanne Harris, with their equal flair and cache for magical realist nibbles, Lily Prior has created an unforgettable woman in her hot and voluptuous librarian named Rosa Fiore.   From her agrarian roots in the sunswept Sicilian countryside, learning to cook in more than one sense of the word, to her rare books librarian days, when she meets L'Inglese, the mysterious Englishman who releases her oceans of pent-up passion, Rosa is a complex and loveable human being, despite her many quirks and foibles.   The story is consummately readable and lots of fun; the prose drips with all the sensability (no, this is NOT Jane Austen!) of olive oil and tomato sauce in its richness and savory flavors.   The few sex scenes (not in the least gratuituous and again immaculately written) are erotic, without being pornographic and hot, hot, hot.  A highly literate romp through the kitchen.	2002-09-21

Until this short, entertaining book, part memoir and part travelogue, I'd never read much of anything positive about Haiti.  Years of political strife and the Duvalier dictatorships have certainly taken its toll on this densely populated third of Hispaniola (the rest is the Dominican Republic), but apparently Haiti is ready for tourists again and there's much to attact us there.   Carnival, those jubilant and reckless days before Lent, would be a grand time to go.   Like similar celebrations in Rio, Venice, and New Orleans, this a festival of the bizarre and the ridiculously sublime.   Danticat is a fine writer and portrays her native country and countrymen with clarity and passion.   This is part of Crown Journeys, a very promising new series of travel essays, written by some of our finest contemporary authors.  Educating and entertaining; makes you want to book passage on the next flight or ship.	2002-09-17

Sylvia Beach, with eyes and ears that missed little in the way of nuance and subtlety, as much compassion for her fellows as passion for their writing and her bookshop, and a plucky all-American, \\"the gal can do it\\" spirit, wordpaints very likely one of the most accurate portraits of literary and artistic ex-patriates in Paris in the Twenties and Thirties.   While they do seem a jolly crew, Beach is unflinching in her descriptions of the tiffs and teapot tempests that regularly flew.   While such works as Hemingway's MOVEABLE FEAST, McAlmon's BEING GENIUSES TOGETHER, and Janet Flanner's PARIS WAS YESTERDAY are interesting and viable, each in its own way, Sylvia's little book out-sparkles them all for wit and humane truth.

How appalling that there are those shallow cretins who have the extremely bad manners to bash Lisa Beamer!   I wonder if they even bother to read her engaging book (I loved to know how much of the book is Lisa and how much her co-author Abraham.)  There is so much here, just below the surface of her engrossing and utterly entertaining story of her life with and since 9/11, without her unpretentious husband-hero of Flight 93.   Lisa manages to so elegantly and eloquently capture the essence of Christian spirituality (i.e. what it REALLY means to be a Christian).   Her prose is totally unassuming, but like the greatest spiritual writing, it resonates with a passion and fervency that inspires while it entertains and informs.   Lisa, Todd, their boys, and baby Morgan, while being the quintessential Everyfamily, are superbly portrayed and utterly delightful in their \\"you want to bring them home to meet the family\\" qualities.   The section where she recreates the final moments aboard Flight 93 are as gripping and page-turning as the grittiest Tom Clancy novel.   A beautiful book for our uncertain times and it's so pleasing to read that there are actually Christian out there who truly understand what their faith is all about.

Louis Auchincloss is always dead-on in his fine wrought character portraits throughout his prolific oeuvre.  Here, in what is likely his finest work, that, along with all his other formidable storytelling gifts, the characterization is at its lofty apex.   He also experiments a bit with form, going beyond the usual fictional biography techniques by including pertinent conversations and writings by former students (a brilliant few chapters!), family, and associates.   Indeed, there is a certain irony in his biographer's comments late in the book: &quot;But my trouble is precisely that I am not interested in writing a biography.  I am interested in inspiring my reader, and I am much at odds with my century in believing that to demonstrate the best by itself is more inspiring than the best with the worst.&quot;  We get an entirely balanced portrait of a great man of ideas who, joyously, is ultimately as human and full of foibles as the boys he so carefully nurtures.

Like Russo, Wood is intimately and intricately familiar with the people she characterizes so well.   Some of these stories could happen anywhere; some only in smalltown Maine.   The stories are loosely connected and characters overlap in what in the hands of a lesser writer, might seem a contrived structure, but which here adds a depth of patterning to the already complicated relationships between these entirely lovable, if foible-full creations.   You won't find Abbott Falls on any map of Maine, but towns and situations of similar ilk about everywhere, especailly in the smalltown Maine of the human heart.	2002-08-30

This classic of prep school angst and identity reads well again many years post-adolescence.  Certainly, the familiar tale of two boys vying for self-realization against the early 1940s mists of war, set in Knowles' lovely New England neurotica prose, is timeless and appeals not only to the nerdy intellectuals of the under-twenties, but to much older world weary, but still looking for hope crowd. There's so much going on here, well beyond Finny's quirky clinging to his own fantasies of war.  The relationship between Finny and Gene definitely merits an even closer reading and the litcrit crew really have not begun to delve the deeper meaning of Knowles' masterpiece.  This may be the great American novel of the 20th century; it's surely a candidate.	2002-08-25

Often when \\"adult\\" authors try their hands at young adult fiction, the result is less than wonderful; not so with the astounding and incomparable JCO.    She brilliant adapts her unflinchingly darkly romantic style for slightly younger readers.  We are accustomed to literally climbing into the heads of her all-too quirky, all-too real characters and we get to that here too.   There is a difficult section in which Big Mouth's pet golden retriever is dognapped and for a couple of chapters, reader hearts can expect to move upwards into throats.  YA audience or not, this is classic Oates.  One can only hope she'll deign to do some more for younger readers, that we older adults can enjoy as much as her even grimmer, grittier, and utterly readable usual fare.   Actually, young adults would certainly also enjoy her BLONDE, BEASTS, THE RISE OF LIFE ON EARTH, them, DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WILL, all of her suspense novels, written as Rosamund Smith, and many of her short stories.<BR>Oates may well indeed be our greatest living American novelist.	2002-08-11

Author Carpenter knows well the indefatigably irascibility so central to the archetypal fishermale, a dying breed along the Atlantic shore.   Ronette, his sternlady-cum-earthmother, is no less mythic and memorable in all her splendorous white-trashiness.  This novel provides an alternative, yet valid portrait of Vacationland Maine, one this writer finds an entirely refreshing after too much outlet shopping, clear-cutting, and cutesy lobster kitsch.   Comparisons have already been made to Richard Russo and Carolyn Chute and they are apt.    Empire Falls and Egypt, Maine are absolutely just up the backroads from Orphan Point.   There's some brilliant writing here and I suspect and hope to hear more from William Carpenter, whose job of teaching literature at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor must be awfully fun.   And indeed there just seems to be something awfully fun about any English teacher who writes a book in language as blue as the Atlantic sky and as salty as the briny air on a chill day in October in Maine.	2002-08-04

Her characters, like the kids next door or that nice teacher down the street, are vibrantly realized and shockingly knowable.   Her prose echoes the lyrical hyper-surrealism of Kafka, the sparseness of Hemingway,  the richness of Faulkner, and the mannerly humor of Austen, while sparkling vivaciously all on its own.

Yes, there's poetry; yes, there's the ever-compelling questions of aesthetics; and yes, there's magic realism to rival Garcia Marquez and Borges.   And it's all so prettily done.   This rich entwining of art, music, magic, poetry gracefully lifts this novel from the merely entertaining to the sublimely mythic.

Snicket well establishes the resilient personalities of his young protagonists here as well as the drolly wickedness of his vile villain.    For wordplay, unflinchingly intelligent prose, and subtle, entirely anti-pedantic morality, nothing compares to this amazing little book and its siblings.   Lemony Snicket, along with J. K.

Back in the 1960s, there was something about a minor comic book character appearing in STRANGE ADVENTURES that stuck with me long after his obscurity had become more than mere.   That character was Animal Man and apparently he had a similar effect on British comics genius Grant Morrison.   This book is a collection of the first nine of Animal Man's contemporary adventures under Morrison's competent pen.   While Morrison's ever-present wry humor is present, there are sufficient superheroics as Animal Man and his family, a pretty bourgeois group, come to terms with life in the Eighties, super powers, and the conflict the two can create.   This is a must-read and must-have for all graphic novel collections and fans of the other Brit comic masters Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman will find much to enjoy here as well.   The art is also fabulous; even the superpeople look like actual human beings.	2002-06-17

I find it very disturbing how intensely accurate and psychologically sound author Oates can write of her twisted and entirely weirded-out protagonist.  Such is indeed the gift of an incredibly talented, virtuoso, and versatile literary artist.   Never forget that Oates is a consummate stylist and that her characters, plots, and settings are always vividly and aptly imagined and that her writing is always the literary equivalent of cream (sometimes fraiche; sometimes ice, sometimes whipped, and sometime sour, but cream nonetheless!).   However in this short novel, her experimentation with odd slangy sentence fragments, bizarre punctuation and ungainly capitalization are absolutely Faulknerian.  Certainly, there is much here to remind of THE SOUND AND THE FURY,  especially the similarities in communications between Benjy Compson and Oates' own Quentin.   An amazing book for Oates fans and I really hope the true crime crowd find their way here too.	2002-06-15

While never wavering from her entirely readable prose, the author flawlessly interweaves endless references, allusions, and myriad other techniques and devices which move her work from the merely grand books for the `tweenage to something considerably more literate and \\"critically sound,\\" in its most erudite and arrogant connotation.  Plot.  Character.  Incredible settings.  It's all there, but thankfully, blessedly, there's so much more.

Ecological, both natural and social, books abound these days, but that wasn't the case back in 1967 when this book was first published.    Hopefully in the intervening years, McPhee's elegant but spare prose has helped remove or at least, temper the damage done early in the Twentieth Century to the reputation of the Pine Barrens and its denizens by well-meaning, if arrogant, social scientists.    The Barrens is truly a glorious piece of nature and those who dwell there have their own unique charm and grace.  McPhee, a consummate raconteur, reveals both with intelligence and a warm empathy.   It's still hard to believe that the Barrens exist, mere miles from the rambunctious urbanity of Philadelphia and New York City, but McPhee's book, still vital and relevant after all these years, truly makes you want to visit and maybe even stay.	2002-06-09

Amy herself is a heroine cut from the same fabric as Anne Shirley, Hermione Granger, Dorothy Gale, Lessa, and, as Linda Medley points out in her nostalgic introduction, Jo March; yet uniquely a 21st Century girl living in a mostly medieval fantasy.

That seems to be Blocks great strength as a writer, to describe and narrate evil without morbidity and with a graceful and beautiful prose.    Shes very successfully un-Disneyfied these tales and returned to them their original rawness.   Glass, Wolf, and Ice (her takes on Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, and the Snow Queen) are particularly outstanding.

This small book would serve nicely as an introduction to classical mythology for the middle grades and interested adults as well.   Spires' tone as she retells the tales of not only Arachne, but of Pandora, Orpheus and Eurydice, Sisyphus, Endymion and others as well, is just wry and arch enough to be quite delightful and so appealing.  This is captured very well in Gerstein's simple and almost cartoonish illustrations.   It's just so fun to hear Eurydice saying \\"I was married to Orpheus for about fifteen minutes when I was bitten by a poisonous snake and brought down to the underworld.  So much for my happiness.\\"   Spires' characterizations of these well-known archetypes are always on the mark.   The cast of characters list at the end of the book is also useful, if not essential, and also set in a droll prose.   The work well fills the gap between the D'Aulaires' classic Book of Greek Myths and the more adult By Jove!

When I first encountered Terri Windling's awesome Fairy Tale Series several years ago, I learned that one of the authors who was working on a tale for the series was Tanith Lee.   I anxiously anticipated her book and it was well worth the wait.    I truly believe I'd recognize a Tanith Lee-created character just about anywhere.   She marvelously writes the most wickedly flawed, but insidiously human people.    I also greatly admire her ability to sustain characterization consistently throughout her work.  The plot is great here too; a variation on the Snow White tale magically interwoven with the whole Demeter-Hades-Persephone fertility mythos from ancient Greece.   This book has tremendous appeal to not only fantasy, mythology, and fairy tale aficionados, but would serve as a great introduction to Lee's work as well; especially recommended would be her Red as Blood collection of fairy stories.   Lee is often compared most favorably with Angela Carter;  this analogy remains apt with this latest book.   The other books in Windling's Fairy Tale Series are also as good as this one.	2002-05-08

De Lint, who gets better with each new novel, is at his best when combining folkloric traditions as he does here with Mexican brujeria, Native American, and Celtic.    The blend is becoming more seamless and the mix makes for fascinating reading.  His plots are strong and his characters linger long after the last page is turned.   His vision of the larger than life aspects of the mythos he so adroitly imagines is tempered by some very genuine, foible-full humanity.    This is a grand tale in the greatest storytelling traditions and while he manipulates the myths and folklore to his purposes, he does with respect and the essence remains true.   Captivating reading.   If you enjoy the adult fairy tales of Angela Carter, Tanith Lee, Jane Yolen, and the similar series of short tales editing by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling, you'd likely appreciate this, as would readers of Borges, Garcia Marquez, and Jonathan Carroll.	2002-05-05

Here she imagines an easily believable direct communication between her human, fey, and animal folk that entertains as it charms.   I must say her earlier reworkings of Sleeping Beauty I found less satisfying than this, but now I am considering rereading BEAUTY and ROSE DAUGHTER.   I suppose one could also find fault in the novel's pacing.   The first two-thirds of the book move at a pleasant enough pace, but the final third, leading to the ultimate confrontation, races along and you can't turn the pages quickly enough.   That should keep no one from reading this fresh take on a classic fairy tale.  Oh, and as for McKinley's prose style, pure butta!	2002-04-17

It's about human beings and how they relate to one another and how our other passions, be it art, food, music, or anything else, often get in the way.    Mothers and daughters and fathers and daughters and the inevitable mutually afflicted wounds are profoundly displayed against a well-researched and lovingly wrought historical array of seventeenth century Italy.   Frequently, I very solipsically found myself wondering why we have to spend so much time dealing with ugliness and unpleasantries in our beautiful world.   Alas, it's all selfish fantasy; harsh reality is unfortunately the arena in which our ultimate humanity must be won.  So it was for Artemisia, her father, and her daughter, so well told by author Vreeland.   Such a joy to read and so compellingly an affirmation of life.	2002-03-21

Like it earlier companion volume, this is a gift to cherish and to help remember those endless, tiresome, exhausting, horrific, and heroic days of September 2001.   This time there are lots of recognizable characters in the stories as well as the heroic hordes the book so lovingly honors.   It is very hard to pick favorites.   Some of the stories produce small, winsome chuckles, while others open up the tear ducts we thought wed never turn off again last fall.   Theres an absolutely delightful Krypto story where Supermans best friend brings his own enormous water dish to share with the rescue dogs at Ground Zero.   Theres also an amazing, but very brief tale of Death and Destruction of the Endless by Neil Gaiman.   This is such a beautiful and unforgettable tribute; truly awesome.   Even better, all profits from the sale of this and its companion volume go to aid the victims, families, and communities.  An essential addition to any collection of graphic novels.	2002-03-10

David Lodge bullseyes the academic character in this fast-paced, quickfun read.   He also captures the academic ambiance of the late 1960's very adroitly, whether it be the loosely veiled Berkley or the more obscure English campus.   Lodge's style makes incredible fun, while never ceasing to be very funny.  While this could be read as pure escapism, the author also utilizes some of the very modern and traditional literary techniques he lampoons such as the epistolary form.   Just a delight.  On par with the school fiction of Mary McCarthy and Louis Auchincloss.	2002-02-18

With his second novel, Rice revels in his own voice, yet deliciously chilling echoes of Mother Anne resound throughout.   Rice fils writes not of vampires and witches, but of a far scarier dark humanity.   This novel is bound to bring favorable comparisons to Donna Tartt's Secret History as well.  The characters are entirely memorable, if uncomfortably so and the plot twists and turns with excruciating pleasure.   Rice's style reminds to of early pre-Glamorama Brett Easton Ellis in its sparse and bitterly gritty liquidity --- something from Father Stan, I suspect.   This is quite simply a quick and page-turning read and a great addition to American academic fiction.	2002-02-06

Although originally published as three monthly comic books, this collection shows brilliantly the wonderful versatility of the graphic novel form.    Author Robinson manages to combine just the most apt amounts of lyric eroticism and spine-jingling horror in the intriguing tale of witchery and revenge across the centuries.   The art matches well, from several artists in varying degrees of baroque-ness.  This is a great deal of fun and a genuine reading and perusing pleasure.

Rumors abound that this is the work of Stephen or Tabitha King.  Indeed stylistically, it comes very close to the prose of Mrs. K and frankly I can't imagine any man being able to write so well of feminine intimacies with such candor and understanding.   This is an incredibly fun book with some clever marketing ploys thrown in.   This one was definitely of the I-couldn't-put-it-down variety with fast pacing, fascinating characters whom you came to love or despise without knowing too much, and a plot that thickens like a Seattle gumbo!   Great reading for a cold wintry night.   Too bad Rose Red is only a fiction; it'd do wonders for the Pacific Northwest tourist trade.	2002-01-16

There are intriguing similarities between this and his prior work, the incredible WICKED and the awfully fun CONFESSIONS OF AN UGLY STEPSISTER, yet he heads into various new territories here.   Certainly not as taut as the earliers novels, this one does meander quite a bit and by the end, author, characters, plot and reader do seem quite lost.  Perhaps that was the intent.  Still, this is brainy good times with endless references to children's literature and plenty of scholarly folderol, less stiffly British than diva A. S. Byatt and with Maguire's resoundingly American timbre and elan.  Not one of the author's best efforts, but still quite the amusing read.	2002-01-11

The lean and lyrical prose matches well with very indeed! Klimt-esque illustrations.  Portraying Dream in this Eastern milieu just so vividly points up again the truly universally mythical nature of the character.  I wonder at my fellow reviewers here who say they finished the book in a half-hour or less; I spent that much time per each illustration.  This is a book to relax with and at great leisure, savor.   Well worth the price and absolutely essential for any collections of fantasy, Gaiman, literary fairy tales, and graphic novels.  A good introduction to Gaiman's other work from American Gods to the earliest Sandman collections.  An elegant confection of literary and artistic matrimony.	2001-12-26

The plot is deliciously complicated and the whole thing is simply a pleasure to read.   Heady fiction for smart people.  Can't wait for another.

When MZB died a couple of years ago, I truly expected that there would be no more Darkover novels and that her literary estate would have sense enough not to farm her creations out to lesser writers.  Gladly, that is not the case.   Ms. Ross is an absolutely excellent heir to the entire Darkover milieu.   While she superbly echoes Bradley in much of the content and even style, she aptly adds to the mythos in important details and concepts.   Her extrapolatory gifts appear great.  The book is truly a page-turning delight with memorable characters, as heart-achingly real as MZB's own.

There is much literature on the diseased and disabled and their caretakers, full of raw emotion and excruciating pathos.  There's plenty of that here too, but seldom has the loving anguish and unmitigated joy of caretaking been so gloriously and eloquently expressed.  Crimmins is a fine writer and her book so plaintively sings the song of her husband, the endlessly charming, disability and all, Alan; her daughter Kelly, and herself.   What a privelege and pleasure to be allowed to share their incredible story!   She even pointedly garrotes HMOs and the American health care system.  Simply brilliant!	2001-10-31

Oprah, the doyen of American literary taste, said it herself; that this might be the next Great American Novel.  It isn't, but it is very good and very well-written.   Franzen's characters are quirky and difficult, but well-developed as are his fretful and complicated plots.   There are echoes of Tolstoy and Proust and even Faulknerian bleakness here and the novel's delightful romps through patterning and dark satire contrast not very comfortably with the dire and convoluted complications of plot and character.  The purpose of literature is not always to comfort and soothe; sometimes it reveals (and revels in) those aspects of the human condition that are less than worthy of celebratrion.   Personally, the novel at times was incredibly difficult for me to read because of how very accurately the author portrayed situations so very like my own life at this time of trial, dealing with aging and infirm parents whom I love more than life.   But ultimately the novel tells the truth,however disquieting and unpretty it may be.	2001-10-28

Recent literature has given us so many strong black female characters, but few compare with the women of Cane River.   Tademy is absolutely masterful in the hugely human characters she so lovingly, but utterly unflinchingly portrays.  Perhaps it's because they are her actual ancestors and there is certainly a very real sense of continuity and enduring presence in this amazing story.  As the descendant of slave owners and having recently discovered the black side of my own family, her story resonates and resounds gloriously for me.   I can only hope she has more stories to tell.  A heart-wrenching and soul-sating great American novel.	2001-10-21

Ms. Randall sounds like she'd be an excellent and incredibly intelligent author, well suited to such a pursuit.   Perhaps it's because I've just read CANE RIVER, an absolute delight of a compelling read, but I rather think not.

As one who has studied Bible from both Jewish and Christian perspectives for many years, I can quite calmly and quietly assure the author's critics that she has indeed done a superb job reading, interpreting, and extrapolating the Bible to create this marvelous novel.   Those crucial points of change in any culture and especially in this one, both so familiar and so wondrously strange to 21st century readers, and particularly the gradual move from matriachy to patriachy are endless fascinating.  Ms. Diamant paints very humanely her ancient women and men and her conjecture as to what may have actually happened to Dinah and her family are likely close to the mark.   The shared intimacy and consorority of these women is awesome and something we so lack today.   Oh, the numerous scenes involving human sexuality are hot and raw, but never obscene.

I'd not read James Patterson before and I must say he is a very talent writer.   This small book will do very well, even though the plot absolutely wallows in its maudlin melodrama.    Still, Patterson keeps the reader engaged and reading his fast-paced and heartful prose.   It is truly a fine testament of the human condition that some of this eloquently stated romantic smarm is actually and accurately a reflection of how some of us experience the urge to merge.   The setting and characters also ring true and while not what we used to refer to as &quot;the horsey set on Long Island,&quot; to borrow from Tennessee Williams, the arty young professionals on Martha's Vineyard will no doubt prove as compelling to bourgeouis American readers as the former did a couple of generations ago.    The handful of pop culture icons (Savage Garden; Harry Potter, etc.) are also fun and appealling.  Elsewhere this novel has been compared to Robert James Waller's Bridges of Madison County.   While certain aspects are similar, Patterson is by far the superior craftsman,like sipping champagne, albeit domestic, not French; reading Waller is more like chugging Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill.	2001-08-15

The absolutely elfin Neil Gaiman earns himself a lasting place in American literature with this novel.  There are echoes of Hawthorne, Melville, lots of Lovercraft, and more than a smidgen of Kerouac here.  While wonderfully providing quirky and fascinating personalities for all his mythic cast, the characterization of the Egyptian cat goddess Bast (a Gaiman essential from his Sandman days) and of Whiskey Jack, from Native American folklore are quite unforgettable.  But most amazing of all, is the precise and flawless capture of the quintessence of the American character.  Mr. Gaiman's scalpel-like intuition and perception of who we are as Americans is awesomely brutal and unflinching.  Few writers born on this side of the Atlantic understand and portray it a quarter as well.  This would be an excellent choice for academic study, but that detracts nothing from the fast-paced, page-turning excitement and sheer joie de vivre.

While the characterization here is acutely archetypal, excusing it readily from Proustian descriptive depth, it is truly memorable. The dark goddess Pythia is absolutely Lovecraftian in her gross morbidity and utter vileness. Hero Horatius strides manfully from the literary gene pool that spawned Odysseus, David, Beowulf, and Superman. The sensuously depicted settings easily bring Dante and Milton to mind.

While there are more lyric fantasy writers (the likes of McCaffrey, McKinley, McKillip, and De Lint), which I love dearly, for shear brain-bopping, mind engorging, plain ol' brainy fun, Michael Moorcock has no peers.  His books are full of outrageously disparate concepts and beings, plunged together into the fabulously outre reality he has created for them.   His plots are absolutely Byzantine in complexity and arty playfulness; his characters are archetypal, without being in the least stereotypical or flat, yet each is consummately heroic or vile.    I'm not sure that it's possible to read only one Michael Moorcock book; there's just too much to leave behind; and with the ingenius techniques he uses to return and even revive his large cast, there's just no need to.   But interestingly the historical characters he uses in this novel (primarily Hitler and his Top Nazis) are adroitly and appropriately drawn with exacting attention to period detail and personalities.

Here he is lovingly portrayed as he grows from an engaging, if at times, difficult and complicated childhood to a major player in the history of his planet.   Characterization is always a prime focus and strength in this author's work and her masterful technique is vibrantly displayed herein.   She's also quite adept at fitting together relatively disparate pieces of her now-lengthy backstory of Pern.   The plot never fails to engage and the reader keeps turning the pages, at times on the very edge of the readerly seat.

Cirque du Freak by Darren Shan<br />While this first novel for young readers is slightly marred by some careless editing (the folks at Little Brown should know much better!), it reveals great promise for a superb edition to the juvenile horror genre.  Author Shan finely delineates several appallingly fascinating characters including the eponymic protagonist, but as ever in this sort of literature, the plot reigns.  Intricate as the spider's webs which permeate the text, the reader turns the pages and wishes only to devour more at story's end.  There have been comparisons to R. L. Stine's teeny terror tales, but Shan is a better writer and probably full of plots and characters that haven't been recycled for the umteenth hundred time.  There are resonances of the vampire fiction of Anne Rice and Chelsea Yarbro with the merest soupcon of J. K. Rowling's wizardly romps as well.  Some reviews aim the book at the 9-12 audience, but this old children's librarian would expect it to be a bit too intense for the former, and yet would captivate many an adult admirer of the genre.	2001-04-15

Having grown up watching the TV series based on this 1956 novel, this reviewer had always intended to someday read the book.   I now can certainly see what all the furor was about.  Metalious engaged in some very risky writing for that quieter, more conservative time.   While anything in this novel seens tame to innocuous by today's standards, after the steamy potboilers of Jackie Collins and Danielle Steel, the author's insights into the makeup and less bucolic underpinings of small-town life ring as true as ever.   The characters of Alison MacKenzie and her mother, Constance, are vividly alive and resonate with grace and humanity long after the book is through.   Metalious' style is often overblown and purple prose abounds, but it is all rather fun and refreshing after much of the bleakness of contemporary fiction.   <br />Typically, the Kirkus review above pompously dismisses this as not being an &quot;important&quot; novel and decries its defender from academe as &quot;puffery.&quot;   Kirkus is well-known for such arrogant historionics and should be promptly ignored by the reading public.	2001-03-31

Borchardt, like her sister, wordpaints in broad strokes across a silken canvas with vivid and seductive colors.

From William Howard Taft's astounding girth and specially built bathtub to Bill Clinton's impeachment lies to Ulysses Grant's comment that he knew only two tunes:  \\"One is Yankee Doodle and the other one isn't.\\"   Small's illustrations convey with humor and charm the foibles and humanity of our Chief Executives.   Forming the background figures throughout the book, First Ladies and many politicos parade with abandon.

This is the latest Newbery award winner, written by longtime `tweenage and young adult novelist Peck.    This one is also the sequel to A Long Way from Chicago.  Set in post-Depression, pre-World War II downstate Illinois, this droll tale of a young girl's year with her grandmother is well deserving of the accolades showered upon it by critics and public alike.   The characters here, like in this reviewer's favorite previous Peck book, Secrets of the Shopping Mall, are amazingly and vividly drawn.   The grandmother, while more the coolly prickly sort, rather than warm and fuzzy, is truly memorable with her subtle, backhanded approach to human relationships.   Not only will the scene of the DAR Washington's birthday bash with its cherry tarts, punch spiked with Old Turkey bourbon, and raucous revelations have you rolling on the floor in audacious laughter, but will also linger long after you've finished this slender volume.   Newbery winners always tend to touch the heart; sometimes with bittersweetness; this one does so as well, but with a refreshingly nuanced glimpse at smalltown life, be it rural Illinois or Versailles, Indiana.	2001-03-14

This, a part of the author's long Darkover series, is one of her last since she died in 1999.    To this reviewer's mind, it, like it's other recent predecessors, suffers from the author's return to her science fiction roots and her departure from the high fantasy at which she was near peerless (only Anne McCaffrey comes close).   The fantasy elements dealing with the Darkovans and their large aristocratic families and the rich culture Bradley had so carefully wrought over the years are still superb and well worth the reading; the science fiction is competently written, if at times derivative.   This novel also deals with the death of one of Bradley's most memorable characters, first met years ago in on e of the earliest novels.    Indeed this work seems to dwell much on death; perhaps Mrs. Bradley was aware of her own imminent demise.    An essential read for fans; not a good introduction to the author and her series --- try Heritage of Hastur or The Forbidden Tower instead.	2001-03-04

Byatt never hesitates to drop the erudite name at the most opportune moments such as Virginia Woolf, George Henry Lewes, and, most importantly to this work, Carl Linnaeus.   Her prose style is chattily academic with always just the merest hint of British snoot-in-the-airyness. Her stories never fail to engage and keep the reader not only reading, but thinking as well.   A new Byatt is always a treat; this one is absolutely as good as Possession, if not nearly as long.	2001-02-24

This author has created a rural Maine village which resonates with the fictitious South of William Faulkner with the dense and evocative characters of Charles Dickens.    Ellen Delay leaves her husband after spending days accidentally confined to the huge toolbox on the back of his pickup and moves into the woods.   There she starts up a field dressing business, butchering the game hunters bring in; the business thrives.   As an eccentric living on the edge of a fragile civilization, Ellen becomes a target for ridicule and eventually, of violence when she is gunned by four women, all law enforcement.   Here author Wuori presents his insightful, if indeed outraged story of police excess and violence against the brutal beauty of the Maine woods.   Stylistically and tonally, this is quite an edgy book; certainly not without humor, albeit often dark.   Having spent some time in this area, unequivocally the author knows these people well and revels in their quirkiness.    This reviewer expects much more from this author and greatly anticipates a return to Quillifarkeag, Maine.	2001-02-17

The author is the winner of the 2000 Nobel Prize for Literature, the first Chinese author ever to be so honored.    Primarily known for his dramatic works, this somewhat experimental novel, while certainly demonstrating Gao's flair for theatrics, reveals the often Byzantine intricacies of much Asian fiction.   This is the story of a character, presumably much like the author himself, on a journey to the titular mountain.   As with most fictive sojourns, and in very Joseph Campbellesque patterning, Gao encounters small victories and defeats as he progresses and along the way meets some very bizarre, yet interestingly so, beings like the mythical Wild Men, Daoist masters, and some very intriguing Buddhist nuns.   As with many contemporary Asian authors, Gao is often profane and quite graphic in his descriptions; this will quite likely turn away those of tender sensibilities.   Still, the book would provide an excellent introduction to Asian novelists.	2001-01-27

The Angel and the Sword by Cecilia Holland<br />Amid the bodice-ripping, puerile, and ultimately unsatisfying dreck that passes itself off as historical fiction, there are a small handful of intelligent and literate novelists in the genre, such as Cecilia Holland.   The present book  takes the popular medieval concept of the maiden warrior and deftly splices a riveting and raucous tale from the French legend of Roderick the Beardless.   This marvelous interlacing of fiction, legend, and history is a hallmark of Holland's work and of great historical fiction itself.   The author is also an amazingly adroit wordsmith with her customary clever turns of phrase.  In the first few pages, she, not for the last time either, refers to a major villain of the piece as \\"a gross clod of human earth,\\" --- such an incisive, yet witty way of expressing a crude and popular sentiment.    There is so much to love and enjoy in this book; even those who do not particularly like the genre could readily learn to do so.	2001-01-25

Just read this for the third time and the work absolutely stands up to frequent rereads.    This is fascinating fiction, highly literate and a blueprint for what mainstream literary fiction can be.   The plot, derived from the classic literature which is practically another character in the work, is expertly wrought with sufficient bends and curves like ironworks in New Orleans.   In the finest Southern Gothic tradition, although primarily set at a small Vermont college, Tartt's characters are believeably real, reminding this writer of his own collegiate cliques and cadres.  Few novels these days can sustain interest much beyond a first reading; this is one to reread and resavor each enigmatic and electric moment.    Ms. Tartt needs to give us more; there are rumors of a new book in the fall of 2001.	2001-01-08

Martha Peake by Patrick McGrath<br />McGrath is a master at bringing real pathos and humanity to the sick, the twisted, the grotesque, who always populate his fiction.   Here in relating the story of a father who supports himself and his daughter by displaying his miserably distorted and malformed spine to a nakedly curious public, the author creates a riveting tale, set against the seamy sides of eighteenth century London and pre-Revolutionary War America.   The story, carefully wrought and skillfully developed, still must assume a secondary position to the amazing characterizations.   Martha and Harry Peake live and breathe through the tempest of their lives in such vivacity, Dickensian, yet entirely McGrath.    While far from humorless, this author never lampoons or takes even the minutest cheap shot at these painfully alive monstrosities of the human spirit and condition.	2001-01-03

Saint Hildegard lived in the 12th century.  She was an abbess, a mystic, and eventually, a saint.  Among the considerable writings she left are her thoughts and opinions on the spiritual as well as physical values of various foodstuffs.  This rather unusual cookbook derives its recipes from these theological and visionary musings, although a few are directly from the saint herself.  This is not a meat and potatoes diet at all, but surprisingly well-balanced, considering the limitations of medieval fare.  There is an emphasis on greens and grains, especially that health food junkie's delight, spelt, a decidedly acquired taste.  Dishes vary from the simple, using only a few ingredients to the much more complicated, requiring a very well stocked pantry.  A few ingredients will be unfamiliar to most 21st century cooks in the Midwest.  I doubt that many folks regularly cook with nettles, something we generally consider a weed these days, but St. Hildegard makes a omelet of them,praising their purgative, restorative, and stimulative virtues.  While this slim volume may prove more for reading, than cooking, Chicken Cooked in Wine for the Heart and the Tunisian Ratatouille are quite delicious.	2000-12-31

Even though the protagonist of this, Yarbro's latest in her Chronicles of Count Saint-Germain, is indeed a vampire and, like all of its companion titles, contains a pleasantly horrific tale of the undead, this work, again like its siblings, is much more.   Ms. Yarbro's greatest skill, among considerable others, is her ability to accurately and believably set her bloodsuckers against richly and lavishly wrought historical settings.   This one takes place in northern Spain near the French border and ranges in time from 7th to 12th centuries.   The research is meticulous and superbly displayed.   Of course, her characters, particularly the astounding and ancient Count himself, his servant-companion, and the deliciously vile female vampire he creates are vividly portrayed against the often bleak milieu.    Yarbro is too often decried as a pale Anne Rice knockoff.    This and her other works simply put the lie to any such criticism.   Great vampire stories, most definitely; but finer historical fiction just is not being written.	2000-12-29

The crystalline prose, the finely wrought setting, and the  unforgettable characters that are the hallmarks of her work are all present  again in this historical novel of turn-of-the-20th-century small-town  Vermont.    This is the story of Robbie Hewitt, indeed a preacher's boy,  who, in the finest Huck Finn/Tom Sawyer traditions, finds himself  definitely at odds with the role his family and his father's flock expect  of him.   Like his literary predecessors, Robbie must face a nigh  impossible situation which leads to an ultimate maturing.   This reviewer  must wonder if Ms. Paterson is familiar with the thought and teaching of  contemporary theologian Matthew Fox because there are some striking  similarities in her novel.

Move over, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Gloria Naylor and forget Terry  McMillan altogether.   There is a new vibrantly strong, black and female  voice in fiction.   Ms. Due's prose is as silken and lushly beauteous as  the hair she writes about.   This novel is the story of Madam C. J. Walker,  America's first black female millionaire who made her fortune selling hair  care products developed specifically for black women.    Beyond that, she  was also an untiring (and too unsung) advocate for the potent and often  dismissed power of the black woman.  Madam Walker, originally Sarah  Breedlove, daughter of freed slaves, referring to a comment made by noted  educator Mary McLeod Bethune, said \\"that the world better get used to  seeing a black rose,....  Anyone who does not respect Negro womanhood has  never seen Negro womanhood as I am seeing it now.\\"   There are endless  cameo appearances from the world of post-Victorian culture from Booker T.  Washington to Enrico Caruso in this seamless mix of documentary and fiction  that reads like plum juice down a parched throat in August.    Tananarive  Due is simply a superb young novelist and this is her best writing yet.   There will be greater things to come from her.   There's also an Indiana  connection to this book.

In the great recent tradition of jarringly real young adult fiction from the likes of Bruce Brooks and Chris Crutcher, comes Randy Powell.   Winning kudos from such taciturn review sources as Kirkus and high praise from the  American Library Association for his earlier works Dean Duffy, The  Whistling Toilets, and Is Kissing a Girl Who Smokes Like Licking an  Ashtray?, Powell delivers a page-turning speed read with well-developed and  memorable characters that break and mend hearts, readers' and each others'.     Grady Grennan is the son of Debbie Grennan, the titular dead rock star  --- something along the lines of a cross between Janis Joplin and Kurt  Cobain.   There's to be a tribute to dead and inattentive Mom and Grady is  to have a role in that, but he's not sure he wants it.   There's also his  mentally retarded half-stepbrother (the relationships in this book are  complicated and mostly dysfuctional, but honestly portrayed) named Louie,  one of most endearing of the cast, and certainly the frankest,  unsentimental portrayal of retardation this reader has yet seen.    Vickie,  the wife of Louie's father, is amazingly frustrating and is without doubt,  one of the most interesting stepmothers since Cinderella's; her personal  revelation in the closing pages of the book make it easily the most  satisfying young adult book I've read this year.

Her stories, always larger than life fairy tale  romps in darkened woods, while maintaining a certain strength of  characterization and intricate plots, become, at times, almost secondary to  the beautiful prose in which they are written.   This particular story,  based loosely on Tennyson's The Lady of Shalott and more specifically on  Loreena McKennitt's song of the same name, tells of a woman, cursed  half-mad with love who is locked away in a tower to observe the happenings  of the world from her magic mirror, not the window of her chamber.    The  hero is of course a knight in the grandest of Lancelotian traditions, full  of angst and some self-doubt, all kept well-hidden beneath the virilest  exteriors.

There's also Fabrizio, the young protagonist in prolific `tweenage author Avi's latest page-turner. Fabrizio is apprenticed to  senior mage Mangus the Magician, who has decided to leave all the smoke and  mirrors-type fakery behind in favor of the pursuit of Reason --- a most  appropriate endeavor, set against a Renaissance Italy backdrop with its  astounding triumph of Reason and Science over the dark mysteries and  intrigues of the Middle Ages.    This plot, as often with Avi's stories,  twists and turns and doesn't fail to engage and delight.   There's a ghost  involved, which evokes the lingering question of whether there is actually  anything supernatural or if it's merely something science has yet to  explain.   Avi is simply a master at entwining serious ethical and  philosophical thought within an exciting and frolicsome bit of fiction.   This may be his best work since The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle.    And while Potter fans won't find precise comparisons to that magician's  saga, this is a great story with fun and memorable characters, just as in  Harry's books.	2000-07-08

The  entwined stories of poor judgment and errant passion in both love and  politics (the two are forever married, however unhappily, in the literature  of Latin America) capture and handily retain reader interest and keep the  pages turning.

Stonehenge [2000 B.C.] by Bernard Cornwell<br />Bernard Cornwell's particular literary talent lies in his marvelously rich imagination and ability to extrapolate relevant, intelligent, and highly entertaining stories from the  merest and scantest of archeological and historical data.   In this novel,  he vividly imagines the people who built Stonehenge well before the time of  Christ.    His characters are always very realistic and well relatable to  21st Century readers.   Whether writing of the sea in his Sharpe series or  dealing with Arthurian material in his Warlord Chronicles, all with grand  stage settings and unforgettable background events, the lives of ordinary  people become as true and relevant as the latest breaking news.   This  present book deals with three brothers as different as brothers can be, but  united in their vision of what the great temple we know as Stonehenge  should be.    Cornwell includes a lot of creative pagan mythology here and  the influence of such scholars as Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung can readily  be discerned.   But don't be misled; this is still an action-packed  page-turner as are all of Cornwell's books.    Great for those exhausting  dog days of August.	2000-07-02

The Wine-Dark Sea  by Patrick O'Brian<br />There are few prose stylists writing today who can compare with Patrick O'Brian for the smooth, evocative and fluid stories which come from his pen.   This book, a  particularly fine example of O'Brian's craft, is part of his Aubrey/Maturin  series of sea-faring novels.    Sailor Jack Aubrey, while a typically  crusty man of the blue briny, is also a well-read and witty contrast and  companion to Doctor Stephen Maturin, an erudite physician with a huge love  of the sea.    Together, the two have had many adventures, but in The  Wine-Dark Sea, they face some of their greatest challenges ever with  remarkable spirit and aplomb.   The story here is great entertainment with  lots of page-turning action, but the lush writing is simply seductive and  so easy to become lost and quite \\"at sea\\" within.   While these are often  consider \\"men's books,\\" I strongly suspect that many women would be  attracted to the strong plots, grand characterization, and fine writing;  there is never the least hint of the crude or the coarse in these highly  literate, but so readable novels.  I have often suggested the works of  Patrick O'Brian to writing students as a model for crisp, fresh, lively  prose and most highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a great  read.	2000-06-29

Gary Paulsen is quite simply a very precious natural resource.   In an era of cloying political correctness and stumblingly effluent multiculturalism,  we've nearly lost a vital component of our literary landscape, the boy's  novel.   In years past, there were the books by committee like the Tom  Swifties and the Hardy Boys and the pulpy adventures from Edgar Burroughs  and Robert E. Howard.   While Paulsen, perhaps best known for his Newbery  honor books HATCHET, THE WINTER ROOM and DOGSONG, retains the delightfully  testosteronic and page-turning intensity, to say nothing of their inherent  maleness, of these past pleasures, he is always not only aware of the power  and ardor of manly and boyish emotion.  This short novel from 1998 reflects  what we've come to expect and love from this author.  Set in the Civil War  and loosely based on documentation from the period, a young boy of fifteen  enlists and is off to experience what he perceives as the \\"glories of war.\\"   Of course, he soon learns otherwise as does the reader through Paulsen's  graphic realism that depicts with the accuracy of a camera lens, but  without the weepy sentimentality of other \\"girlier\\" historical novels.    There are certainly echoes here of Stephen Crane's classic RED BADGE OF  COURAGE and Esther Forbes' JOHNNY TREMAIN, but Paulsen's voice, as ever, is  clearly his own and that of many boys and men.   Gary Paulsen's muscular  prose is past due for full Newbery honors.	2000-06-03

Only the man who turned death into a lovely, little goth-girl and dream into a charmingly brooding demigod could manage to create a character from a fallen star.  This stellar heroine, and no less, her half-elfin  hero-love, are enticingly drawn, resonating glimmeringly with the classic  personnel of fairyland, from Oberon and Titania to Glinda and Rhyming  Thomas.  Indeed, this whole over-much-too-quickly novel thoroughly echoes  the established canon of fairy lore and tales.  Neil Gaiman, he of SANDMAN  and DEATH, to say nothing of NEVERWHERE and GOOD OMENS fame, is quite  simply an extraordinary storyteller, be it in prose or graphic fiction.  There is something here for lovers of both.  Gaiman's prose has always  been at once baroquely ornate, yet deceptively simple and readable.  For  many mainstream fiction readers, the crossover to contemporary fairy tales  seems to often difficult, if not anathema.  Mr. Gaiman helps nicely with  bridging that gap for those open to trying something deliciously offbeat.  STARDUST would serve so very nicely as an introduction to the worlds of  wonder, more real that \\"real,\\" of other latter-day fabulists, such as  Angela Carter, Jane Yolen, Tanith Lee, Patricia McKillip, and those adroit  editors Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling with their captivating collections  of shorter works.	2000-03-22

Here the Grimm's HANSEL AND GRETEL provides her a magical springboard for a short, but pithy essay on the extraordinary strife the  human spirit will endure for the sake of doing what's right.    The witch  here is not inherently evil, but is herself a victim of simple ignorance  and substantial bad advice.   As mentioned elsewhere, this reviewer always  enjoys new and imaginative explanations for all those fairy tale elements  which are as familiar as gingerbread houses and wicked stepmothers, but  never are quite entirely elucidated in the classic tales.   Napoli's take  on the candy house, while entirely logical and appropriate for the story,  is nevertheless a bit bizarre and unsettling, descriptors most apt for this  short novel.   As another reader said, you'll never again see this tale in  quite the same manner.   Napoli is generally considered a young adult  author; this reviewer is not so certain that this would be much help for  those average \\"troubled teen readers.\\"    Still, Napoli's style is like a  thread-dense Egyptian cotton bedsheet for smoothness and comfort, even if,  again like those bedclothes, it feels a bit chilly to the touch.	2000-03-17

In the hands  of less gifted writers, there would be a dangerous tendency toward the  maudlin and the strident; and while this would be disaster enough in an  adult audience novel, it would truly be unforgiveable in a book aimed at  young adults.   Not a problem at all here though; authors Yolen and Coville  know exactly what they are doing and how to precisely say what needs saying  without the least overstatement or soggy sentiment.   As one who teaches  composition, I marvel at these two and their ability to always find just  the right word, phrase, sentence or paragraph; this novel would serve well  as a model of precise and concise writing.    And what a grand story!  Two  typical, but oh-so-slightly outre teens find each other and incipient  romance while waiting for the end of the world on a mountaintop in  Massachusetts.   The characterization is superb as always with Yolen and  Colville.   Ms. Yolen familiarly exercises her virtuoso range from picture  books like the powerful SKY DOGS to the enchanted witchery of BRIAR ROSE to  the witty fun of WIZARD HALL and so much inbetween; while Mr. Coville here  tries his hand (entirely successfully) at a slightly older audience than  his usual, but so very exquisite MY TEACHER IS AN ALIEN and JEREMY  THATCHER, DRAGON HATCHER (this writer's favorite!).   This present book  combines their celestial talents sublimely.   While fans of both will not  be disappointed here, this engrossing page-turner has so much to offer not  only young adults, but their longing-for-a good-read parental units as  well.    Yolen and Coville:  More please!	2000-03-16

As an avid and enthusiastic devotee of fairy tales, whether in their most  traditional and earthy garb or dolled up in modern drag, or even  Disney-fied, this writer has encountered innumerable takes on the  Cinderella story.   This one is particularly precious, because it answers a  lot of formerly grand leap assumptions.   For example, why did an otherwise  spirited young lass tolerate subservience at the hands of her stepfamily  for so very long?  Perhaps she was under a curse.   All of those tales  about a fairy or other magical sort bestowing gifts upon children at birth,  eventually leading to trouble are echoed here.   And what was Cindy's  father's problem?  Talk about absentee daddies!  Turns out, there a reason  for that too.   Levine is a charming writer with a whimsical sense of  humor.   Her characters are well and fully drawn and particularly her  heroine, her prince, and the fairies (there are two major ones here and a  sprinkling of others) do not soon leave the reader after the book is  closed. This will not fail to tantalize and delight fans of Donna Jo  Napoli, Robin McKinley, and even the Harry Potter crowd.   CONFESSIONS OF  AN UGLY STEPSISTER by Gregory McGuire is a similar, but directed at a  slightly more sophisticated audience, but is also tons of fun.	2000-03-12

This short novel, McKillip's essay on the nature of love, is compelling and absolutely coloratura writing.    While always a wordsmistress of the most sensate and delectable turns of phrase, even from her earliest BEASTS  OF ELD days, her prose here is much like the silken cobwebs and flushed  floral beauties she tells of within.   Some have said this little treasure  is thin on plot, but this simply isn't so, although `twould not be overly  difficult to drown in the lush style.  Ms. McKillip borrows classic fairy  tale and ballad themes from sources as diverse, yet diffuse as Christina  Rossetti's GOBLIN MARKET and TAM LIN.   As always she draws marvelously  realized characters and, while love triangles are the maudlinly mundane  stuff of light romance and soap opera, few readers will leave Corbet,  Laurel, and Rois of WINTER ROSE untouched and unmoved.   McKillip is always  uniquely herself, but readers of Robin McKinley, Donna Jo Napoli, A. S.

This, the  first book of this substantial series, introduces characters and concepts,  which, while familiar in all the fun ways without be derivative or mundane,  never fail to amuse, amaze, or even, affright.   Working with the elements  of the great hero story, Jordan tells of a grand journey with lots of  adventure along the way, experienced by a set of characters to whom  everyone can relate.   Jordan is a born storyteller and handily develops  memorable characters including the homebody Loial (an all-too-human  nonhuman Ogier), who intellectual curiosity drives him to adventure.   This  is the story of magical science (or perhaps, scientific magic) gone  disastrously wrong and the resulting implications for not only people, but  environments as well.

Simply astounding that some critics feel this the least of the Preacher story arcs to date!   Writer Ennis is still perfectly comfortable writing this incredible character in fascinating, if decadent situations.   This  time out we get to meet Jesse's delightful and utterly enchanting mother, a  creature inspired by the painting of Wyeth.   Other new enticements include  Cindy, the female deputy sheriff; Lorie, the cyclopean girl with an  unexpected perspective on the world; Skeeter, the cuddly mongrel whose  loyalty and obedience to Jesse proves to be more than merely a life  enhancement; and the entirely despicable Odin Quincannon, whose personal  perversion intrigues, while it disgusts.   Writing such complex characters  at this level of sophistication is no easy feat, but Mr. Ennis does so  masterfully.   Steve Dillon's art perfectly catches the nuances of the  characters and their setting.   This is truly a virtuoso performance and  truly a grand reading experience.   Preacher is not for everyone,  certainly; but if you love a superb story well told and are not offended by  the seamier side of life, there's little better.	2000-01-16

Ms. Thompson is an artist who has cleaned and broken her brushes  as a comic book illustrator.  Of course, this shows in her droll  illustrations for her own books.  If, however, you look long and caringly  enough, you'll find wisps of Rackham, Hogarth, Charles Addams, Edward  Gorey, and even BETTY BOOP in the entrancing brushstrokes illumined here.

Ostrander and Truman, along with Mandrake and Bair, are far from novices and the benefits of their  collective experiences shimmer through this, likely their finest work.  Everyone knows that Superman's adoptive family found the infant Superbaby  in a Kansas cornfield and raised the prodigious progeny in Smallville.    This tale tells how the Kent family comes to Kansas and it is the story of  the American westward expansion.   There are rich characterizations here in  Nathaniel and Jeb Kent, two brothers divided by personal, familial, and  eventually political differences; the lovely half white, half Delaware  native Mary, whose passion and grace sustains Nathaniel Kent through many  trials, as well as the reader; and Jonathan Kent himself, the adoptive  father of Superman, who narrates the saga in a series of letters to his son  the reporter in Metropolis and his bride.   Then there are the cameos; some  historical; some purely from the western comics genre, including Brian  Savage, the Scalphunter; Jonah Hex; John Wilkes Booth, John Wesley Hardin,  the James brothers and so many others.  This delicious tapestry is not only  for comics fans, but also for Western readers (those who love John Jakes or  Dana Fuller Ross, will find much to love here as well) and American history  buffs.  Ostrander did a superb job with the research here.  Simply a  glorious family saga in the full richness of that tradition.	2000-01-05

I've always been fascinated by the unique kind of morality found among the dregs of society.   Middle America has its William Bennett as moral compass; so the messy underside has Jesse Custer (a truly inspired choice  of surname with resonances of General Custer!).   In this, the premier  collection of PREACHER tales, masterly composed and illumined by Garth  Ennis and Steve Dillon, we meet not only Jesse the Preacher, but also his  token adolescent male fantasy eye candy, but not entirely unredeemable  girlfriend, Tulip and Cassidy, the way too cool to be real, but you still  want to be friends vampire.   Ennis is a brilliant character stylist and  blows his creations far beyond what is usually expected (and received) from  the funny books.   There is quite literally tons of violence, profanity,  and sexual situations, so this is not recommended for the very young or the  faint of heart; however, and as unlikely as it may seem, none of that is in  the least bit gratuitous.   Ennis and Dillon skillfully craft their  combination morality and miracle play around, through, and with these  four-color folk and their interactions.  Scary!  Yes!  Some scenes, while  not the goriest ever, are enticingly shivery and linger with the reader  after the book is closed and tucked nicely away on the nightstand.  A great  read.  I feel badly that some readers just won't be able to get past the  vehicle to get to the fun.	2000-01-04

Litcrit, that sad and weary and so often maligned and detested human endeavor, has produced a flicker of luminous hope in Michael Schmidt's latest and probably magnum opus.   Like Samuel Johnson's long-previous work  of the same title, to wit: Schmidt aspires to venerate with his book, this  is not only a joyous adulation of the greatest and grandest poets in  English from the language's emergence out of the melange of Norman French,  vernacular Latin, and myriad Celtic and other influences, but also an  absolutely fascinating, endlessly readable, and even raucous romp through  the history of poetry in English.   As a professor of English, I'm always  reluctant to assign readings in criticism because students, already  recalcitrant or even hostile toward the literature itself, will turn and  walk away, perhaps forever, when faced with the pedantic and pedagogical  masturbation which is way too much litcrit.   Maybe Schmidt's work will  change that; I do intend to use a bit or two in the coming semester.   The  essays are generally fairly brief or, if longer, are sufficiently  well-written to engage even reluctant readers.   Unlike most histories,  Schmidt with an amazingly multicultural, non-canonical insight, includes  American, Australian, Caribbean, female and other minority poets such as  the Countess of Pembroke; Isabella Whitney, Edward Brathwaite; and Derek  Walcott.   Truly an amazing book.	1999-12-30

I have never been much of a Batman fan since the TV show went off back in the late sixties; however, this collection from the late eighties shows a lot of the promise the character has always contained, but seldom realized.    Frank Miller is certainly one of the finest writers to emerge from comics  in the last generation of so, and  this is a fine example of his work.    His conception of Batman and the entire body of Bat-lore is unique, while  remaining respectful, if not cloyingly faithful, to the years of prior  continuity.  This story within is of parallel obsessions: Bruce Wayne's  passionate promise on his parents' grave to rid his city of the criminal  element and James Gordon's equally ardent impulse to do much the same, only  through traditional law enforcement means.  The portrayal of Selina Kyle as  the incipient Catwoman is particularly poignant and gripping as is the  long-suffering portrait of Barbara Gordon, the quintessential cop's wife.    While the art is interesting in a primitive, naive mode, David Mazzuchelli  and Richmond Lewis seem an unfortunate choice of artists for the work that  relaunched the entire Batman franchise.   Perhaps, however, it is a  testament to the strength of Miller's writing, that the art neither  detracts nor distracts from the story.	1999-12-30

Neil Gaiman's portrayal of Death as a sweet Gothette with a sense of humor and a marvelous joie de vivre is far from the usual cloaked figure with scythe.    In Death: The High Cost of Living, she adventures with a somewhat suicidal young man named Sexton, showing him the intrinsic value  of living.   They encounter the darling dyke duo, popstar Foxglove and here  dear domestic and pregnant love Hazel the chef, who provide a glimpse of  the glamorous life and its toll on otherwise loving relationships.    Gaiman's clever turns of plot and stolidly real characterization rivet  interest and unfailingly engage reader attention.   There is so much here  to appeal to a young adult and older teen audience, but the depth of  character and complexity of plot will resound with and delight more mature  audiences.    Longtime comics readers will quickly become Gaiman fans (and  what pleasures await them in his Sandman and Books of Magic tales!) and  those who either have never know or had abandoned the four-color medium  should give it a try.   This and Death: The Time of Your Life will not fail  to please and to distract.	1999-12-29

This collection of Gaiman oeuvre again features the witty and charming Goth-girl, uniquely a people person, called Death.   We also revisit Foxglove and Hazel, the rock star and chef lesbian couple introduced in  prior Death tales, and their son, Alvie.   Indeed, toddling Alvie dies in  this series, but Hazel persuades Death to give him back to her.    Characterization, ever a Gaiman forte, is no less so here.   The principles  all far exceed expectations and by tale's end, seem like folks<br />you know  and would like to know better.   A relatively minor character, Vito is  humorously, yet poignantly portrayed as an underwear model and, while  serving as Foxglove's &quot;beard,&quot; as she struggles between a desire  to publicly come out and the supportive, but cautious advice of her  management, he too is shown in the fullness of humanity.   There are the  usual Gaimanesque plot contortions, which never seem forced or contrived,  but merely the natural evocations of the quirky lives the<br />characters  realistically live.    DC Comics clearly marks this collection as  &quot;suggested for mature readers;&quot; while it certainly isn't for  children, there is much here for older teens and young adults and the  sophisticated plot and characterization will not fail to nail seasoned  readers.	1999-12-29

Retroactive continuity is frequently a buzzword these days in the comics milieu.   While the Justice League of America has been around since the late 1950's, this collection updates their beginnings and first year for  the new century.    Mark Waid, for many, a definitive JLA chronicler and a  master storyteller, enchantingly and with loving respect, reworks early JLA  adventures and lore together with contemporary plotting and  characterization into a grand reading experience for new readers as well as  for longtime fanboys and continuity geeks.    The League here is the Flash,  Green Lantern, Aquaman, Black Canary, and the Martian Manhunter, but there  are tons of guests from the original Doom Patrol, the Blackhawks, the  Challengers of the Unknown, and a pre-beard Green Arrow.   DC's Big Two,  Superman and Batman, also appear briefly.   Traditional League lore such as  the Secret Sanctuary, the JSA, Snapper Carr, Amazo, Despero, and Kanjar Ro  are all present, but cleverly entwined with new, additional concepts such  as the insidious Locus, the original Blue Beetle, Maxwell Lord, and an  incipient and flirtation between the Flash and Black Canary.   Waid is also  an expert of the bon mot and clever conversation:   <br />Flash (speaking of  Green Lantern): &quot;Besides, of course, he's going to get all the  attention.    He's the prettiest.&quot;<br />Black Canary: &quot;Well, you  have me there.   He is  cute, isn't he?&quot;<br />Flash:   &quot;Actually, I  was joking, but I'll take your word for it.&quot;<br />As with so many of  these collections, there is something here for even the newest comics  readers and tons of delight for the eternal fanboys.   Most highly  recommended.	1999-12-29

Indeed, DC Comics introduced this idea in the famous &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; story decades ago, but then came the  equally renown (infamous?) &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in the  mid-eighties and DC's parallel worlds mess was cleaned up, more or less.   But now it's back; this time lightly veiled as an &quot;anti-matter  universe&quot;.   This, the first hardcover JLA graphic novel, is an  enjoyable tale for longtime DC fanboys and will cause little problem for  those less familiar with the JLA and its also decades-long history.   The  villains here will look familiar, being the anti-matter universe (where  everything is the opposite of the regular universe) counterparts of the  JLA's &quot;big guns&quot;: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and  Green Lantern as reflected in Ultraman; Owlman, Superwoman, Johnny Quick,  and Power Ring.   Grant Morrison with his usual mastery portrays the  antithetical characters with wit and a bit more maturity than would be  expected in a monthly four-color comic.   Superwoman, apparently more of a  dominatrix, is supposedly involved with Ultraman, but has Owlman as well on  the side.  Johnny Quick seems to have some sort of drug addiction which  evinces itself in truly bizarre ways as it passes through his Speed Force.   Power Ring, depicted with a very spiffy costume and spiky haircut, seems a  tad schizophrenic and somewhat controlled by, rather than controlling his  magic ring.   Alexander Luthor, a hero in the antimatter universe, is also  portrayed superbly with essentially the same personality as his &quot;Earth  2&quot; (his phrase for the DC Universe best known and home to Superman and  the JLA), but neatly converted from villainy to heroism.   Amazon has a  great price for this sure-to-be a collector's item.   Again, a fun read for  fanboys and first-timers alike.	1999-12-26

While as other reviewers have stated, these three stories unfailingly and unflinchingly touch the heart and celebrate the spirit in ways far too many holiday tales only aspire to, Capote's stories, like his longer finished  works like IN COLD BLOOD, are also pure literary delights.   The characters  of Buddy, Miss Sook, Odd Henderson, and Buddy's New Orleans father are  richly individual and fully realized, yet resonant of some of the most  colorful characters in the vast and lovely muddy swamp of Southern  literature.   Capote has often been reviled as a dissipate, degenerate, and  decadent social butterfly, but these tales show him to hold the highest  moral standards, of such degree that his defamers could never mete.   The  appeal of his work is wide and varied.   There is a bit of the Dickensian  in his characters as well as echoes of Faulkner, Tenessee Williams,  Flannery O'Connoer and his chum, Carson McCullers.  Stylistically, if one  listens carefully, Poe and Melville, even Hawthorne and Cooper, and  especially Capote's beloved Proust ring through and true.   Truly, a  holiday treat.

As a parttime paralegal, I've encountered a substantial cross-section of practicing attorneys and amazingly, Batton Lash has captured two recurrent personalities in Alanna Wolf (of the startling hairstyle --- how does all  of that stay up there! ) and Jeff Byrd (of the droll little barrister  school to which Petrocelli and John Grisham both belong).   In this, the  second volume of their collected cases, these intrepids represent a  supermodel against her agent who brings worlds of new meaning to the  experession &quot;controlling&quot;; then there's the sideshow barker who  claims to have the &quot;real&quot; Dracula on display (after reviving  Dracula, the counselors help him deal with immigration problems and assist  the Frankenstein family in reclaiming their &quot;stolen&quot; property, a  monstrous heirloom) and Sodd, the Thing That's An It, which to longtime  comics fans will remind of other marshland monsters like DC's Swamp Thing,  Marvel's Man-Thing, and, granddaddy of them all, The Heap.   While these  are sophisticated stories (Wolff &amp; Byrd began as a strip in the  NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL), there's lots of droll humor and even some  delightfully on the mark explanations of legal concepts (indeed, I've used  a handful of panels a time or two in paralegal seminars and classes).   Oh,  and I almost forgot my favorite story in this volume in which Alanna and  Jeff attend the ever-macabre bar convention, complete with some very scary  sexual harassment and the snoozingly horrific panel discussion, to say  nothing of the cocktail hour terrors.   Not just for attorneys or comics  aficionados, but for everyone with a taste for the merrily offbeat.	1999-12-17

Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN comics series is categorically a classic in the field.  Certainly, a certain trepidation about other authors mucking about with his uniquely defined characters is not only understandable, but  expected.  Not to worry our continuity-riddled grey matter!   In this, the  second collected volume of THE DREAMING comic, Caitlin Kiernan proves more  than apt to the task.   Here we have Gaiman archetypes like Mervyn, Matthew  the Raven, Eve (yes, THAT Eve, the first one!), the Corinthian (a very  bizarre dream who here deals with his addiction to eyeballs --- no  twelve-step program was ever like this!), and my personal favorite, Lucien  the librarian of dreams.   The stories are all handsomely sophisticated  with even more than a touch of Gaimanesque erudition.  Additionally, while  Ms. Kiernan's style, even semantics and syntax, are mindful of Mr. Gaiman,  much of her prose is solely her own.   As with Gaiman's masterful oeuvre,  this is comics in its finest form.  A grand introduction to those who have  either forgotten or ever known the pleasure of comics.	1999-12-17

Jane Yolen has written many charming and evocative tales of wonder over the years and now with all the well-deserved fuss over J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potters, fans young and old of the genre will love Yolen's 1991  effort, WIZARD'S HALL.  In many ways similar to the Potters, this short,  very quick read with Yolen's usual well-defined and entirely likeable  characters and fast-paced,not overly complex plot, and typical wit and  humor are as ever, right on target.   Thornmallow, his friends, and enemies  are all cut from the same rich fabric as the other grand mages of  literature from Merlin to ubiquitous Potter.    A great break between or  after the Rowling books, without disappointment.  Aimed at preteens (but as  usual with Yolen, with some more advanced vocabulary thrown in --- the  reading teacher in me just has to love an author to actually tries to  expand vocabulary while endlessly entertaining her audience), this should  not be overlooked by older mavens of humourous fantasy.  (There's also some  ethics education going on here, but Yolen is never pedantic, so, sh! don't  tell anybody!)	1999-11-05

Recently, I reread this, the first of the many McCaffrey dragonovels, and it simply is as disarmingly charming and intriguing as it was all those years ago at first reading.  While in the more recent books, there is a  noted maturity and a most gracious depth to the Dragonlady's writing, the  earlier stories enjoy a simplicity and guileless innocence that just isn't  quite the same contemporarily, wonderful as the later books are.   Lessa  and F'lar are quite unforgettable characters and their cuddly reptilian  mounts are none the less.   A delightful and entirely satisfying read.	1999-03-27
