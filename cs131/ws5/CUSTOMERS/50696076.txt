In the spirit of Dorling Kindersley, this new edition of the World Atlas is a masterpiece of presentation. Colorful illustrations and miscellaneous information abound. It has none of the stuffy professional feel to it, but is bright with plenty of white space. The little info tidbits are also interesting for trivia buffs like myself.<br />This is an excellent volume for a family library, as kids and adults alike will find much to like about it.	2000-11-25

Hey, it's called the American Heritage Dictionary for a reason. We happen to be a proud people and the tradition of using American variants of English words date back from the Revolutionary War when our forefathers sought to differentiate us from the Brits.<br />The complaints from the envious English aside, this dictionary is quite a read. Yes, it's a readable dictionary, if you're into dictionary reading that is. Its presentation makes it less of a strain on the eyes.<br />And as ever, there is more American slang and tech lingo here than you'll find anywhere else, which may be good for parents trying to decipher what their children are talking about.<br />All in all, a dictionary for those who are not scholars for a living.	2000-11-25

This book is imaginative, it's alluring, it's fantastical, but it isn't very good. Why NOT? It's like this.<br />Fantasy is another form of fiction, a story told by an author. At the heart of it all is the plot and the characters. With fantasy, the plot and the characters are doubly important as they are the only believable things. A creative setting is great, but one cannot build a story on top of a setting, but must rather build the setting around the story.<br />What Haydon has created is a masterful piece of ingenuity that shows no skill and sagacity. For all its colorful characters and interesting locales, its vitals are not very good. Despite what some might think, it takes more than a good imagination to write fantasy. Imagination is easy, writing is hard.<br />I get the feeling Haydon tries to hard to be creative and not hard enough to be constructive. It shows in this book. Great setting, colorful characters, but abysmal plot, and simplistic childlike dialogue. It might be interesting to read about the characters and their world but it'll get boring if there is no story to drive it forward.<br />Only an average book at best. For truly superb fantasy, read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. It starts with A Game of Thrones.	2000-11-25

If you're looking for a book that can be your primary guide for long time, this is it. Neophytes and experts alike will benefit from its excess of information and excellent illustration.<br />Personally, I had little trouble navigating through this rather sizeable book. Everything from illustrations to maps are clearly laid out in an orderly manner. It is very important to be able to quickly find the information you need at critical moments when birding.<br />I also had few problems toting this book around.

It was and still is a sweet story, one that must be read by every American. It continues to amaze me how well a simple children's story can capture the lifestyle and the spirit of the late 1800s. It is a tale of nothing less than the human experience: hardship and prosperity alike seen through the innocent eyes of a young girl.<br />Try as you may, you'll never be able to resist the charms of this story. Laura Ingalls Wilder will forever live on in your heart as a bright flame, symbolic of everything good in our country, our world, and our entire existence.<br />It is a must read for all children everywhere.

The saga of Laura Ingalls Wilder is an enduring tale that is an essential part of the American experience. A large part of its enthralling attraction is the honest description of the lifestyle of the late 1800s. It's like a window into our past through the eyes of a girl. We see conflict and character, struggle and triumph, sweet and bitter. It is truly something that will make you better for having read it.<br />This is no less than required reading for young children everywhere. While being educational as well as entertaining, it is so heartfelt a story as to be transcendent. And this book is where that story begins.<br />The journey starts here, and what a journey it is, take the first step and buy this book.	2000-11-25

The level of complexity and sophistication has increased somewhat in this third book of the series. I would call Harry Potter neither complex nor sophisticated, but any increase is good. As the readership J.K. Rowling is growing older as she writes, it makes sense for her to let her books grow as well.<br />Even with this book reaching new heights relative to its two predecessors, it's still entirely a children's novel. And it does its job commendably well. The characters and conflicts are mostly simple black and white, lending to an identifiable attribute.<br />The hype grows as strongly and quickly as ever, but that's good. It may convince your kid to read if his or her friends are doing so. And a love for reading is what this is all about.	2000-11-24

The music market in America is primarily hype driven, but in the Beatles' case, that was a good thing. The Beatles' music was honest, catchy, and revolutionary, instantly appealing to the young of the 60s.<br />Now, decades later, we finally get a tome so comprehensive as to be the definite Beatlemaniac's bible. A Beatles neophyte could become a Beatles expert through this one book alone. That's how thorough the content of the book is.<br />The value is also great.

There would be Brooks, no Goodkind, no Jordan, no Feist, no Martin, etc. etc. etc. It takes literature of a high degree to spark such fascination and enthusiasm in readers and writers alike. It took something like the Lord of the Rings.<br />To be sure, The Lord of the Rings is a mythical tale, a legend documented in detail by a faithful historian. It's paradoxically fantastical and yet so real. The characters are archetypical, but that is how they should be, for legends are after all, the beginnings of all fiction. Everything about it screams refinement. It seems like a good tale passed down from generation to generation, with all of the diluting that occurs along the way.<br />Don't get passed by the bandwagon, jump now!

That style has many inherent advantages as well as disadvantages. The intellectual emotion is high but the human emotion is low. This book feels like a dream instead of an experience. It is constantly fading in and out of one's reality. Like a poem, one never gets a grasp upon it. It stays aloof from the reader, teasing us with its soft caresses.<br />That said, it's still a good read, though somewhat different. The melodrama is in abundance, as is lyrical style, but not much raw drama.	2000-11-22

This book is intelligent, well written and organized, and has loveable characters. It may be a bit too much for anyone under 10, but from 10 to 14, this is great reading.<br />True, it is rather dark and dreary, but it's about time. I always considered an ability to enjoy sadness a sign of genius. One can't live in the happy fairy tales forever.<br />This is a great read for fans of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and fans of this series should check Martin out as well. The two are different yet alike, difficult to explain but easy to appreciate.<br />The final judgment?

As the second book of this imaginative and intelligent fantasy series, The Subtle Knife does its job well. As a standalone book, it excels. What's with the paradoxical comparison, you ask? The other two are just so GOOD. <br />I couldn't help but compare this series to Narnia. The usage of young characters in the parallel world archetype was made infamous by C.S. Lewis. Yet, this series is different and I think, better suited to older children.<br />It is certainly more entertaining than most intelligent prose you'll ever find.	2000-11-22

This is the Britney Spears of children's fantasy. The music is bad, the singing is almost decent, but the hype is tremendous. The controversy also brews.<br />Despite the fact that J.K.

However, it is a little on the flat side as a fiction. Its historical/mythical overtones are strong, yet the characters are all too forgettable.<br />This is a book that is poetic but not quite dramatic, full of melodrama that is instantly gratifying but brief and intangible. It might have done well as a poem but as a book, it just doesn't quite cut it.<br />Nevertheless, the intrigue and whirlwind conflicts of war clash brilliantly in this novel. It's still a fun read if not particularly profound.	2000-11-22

These days, parents should do ANYTHING to get their children hooked on reading. This series is not the best in the world but the hype surrounding it could convince your children to read it. It's a simple, easy read that kids will love.<br />From an older perspective, the series can seem simplistic, but this is for children. Even YA might be too high a rating for it. The zany characters and simple evil versus good conflict are perfect for the young audience.<br />After kids have become convinced that reading can be fun, they'll be more likely to grow up and become intelligent people.

In the Serpentwar Saga, Feist loses some of the magical grandeur of the Riftwar Saga. The characters are more &quot;common&quot;, the focus is on a lower scale. While the Riftwar concentrated on superhuman characters fighting demonic forces, the Serpentwar is more focused on mundane warfare.<br />One cannot fault Feist for not being creative, however. He does well in that department. The story is quite interesting, even if the execution is not always up to par. With this book in particular, that polarization will be evident.<br />All in all, a fun read for fantasy beginners. Advanced fans of the genre should check George R.R.

A book focused on commerce? A book with more intrigue than adventure? What happened to our good old Feist?<br />I suppose a change wasn't necessarily a bad idea. I guess Feist needed some way to stretch out the series. Not much happens in this novel, at least not the main storyline. Oh sure, they go kill some Pantathians and encounter a demon but still. The bulk of the book was about Roo's quest to get rich. Like I said, strange.<br />Still, the book was a fun read. Like all of Feist novels, it is good for beginners to the fantasy genre.

Such a magical series like the Riftwar Saga deserves a correspondingly satisfying and climatic conclusion. In A Darkness at Sethanon, Feist writes some of his best battle scenes ever, and the plot thickens with rapidity.<br />A Darkness at Sethanon cannot possibly disappoint someone already hooked by the magic of Magician and Silverthorn. The level of conflict intensifies and the ominous dark forces gather. The heroes of the land brace for the coming storm. Victory must be achieved to ensure the safety of Midkemia.<br />The Riftwar series as a whole gets a resounding conclusion from this last book. This is Feist at his best.	2000-11-18

When a child has outgrown the childhood classics from Disney, this is the place where parents can continue their reading. The recommended ages of 9 to 12 are excellent, as the level of reading comprehension is perfect for the simple, yet magical tales of Redwall Abbey.<br />The stories themselves are of course, simplistic. The characters are archetypical; good and evil, rogues and warriors, cowards and courageous heroes. There is always a happy ending and the obstacles in the heroes' way are not too frightening or depressing. The setting is well designed and imaginative, retaining the talking-animal attraction of earlier childhood fantasies.<br />There is no better fantasy for the pre-teen crowd. Once a child gets to about 13, however, they are much too old to start. Some might continue to read well past that age, but none will want to start to read what they consider &quot;kiddy stories&quot;.	2000-11-18

This was my first fantasy read and since then I have grown out of its simplicity and moved on to deeper reads. However, I still remember this book with much fondness and nostalgia. It is an easy read for teenagers and beginners to fantasy alike. There are plenty of archetypical characters that can be identified with quickly and easily. The pace is smooth and action filled, without so much as a hiccup.<br />The best part about the novels based on the world of Midkemia is the fantasy setting itself. The world of Midkemia and Kelewan have been carefully developed first as roleplaying campaign settings. The forethought shows in the meticulous details of the world. Midkemia is at once fantastical and yet, believable. The economics and the demographics are plausible, and the politics is decent as well.<br />It isn't the best fantasy you can find but it's a good place to start for those new to the genre, and the magic is unequaled.	2000-11-18

I suppose this series is somewhat entertaining if you've never read anything better in your life. The story is hardly new, and the humor doesn't taste so fresh either. Admittedly, the storyline is quick and the dialogue drives it with force. You can't help but like the books because your brain shuts off almost like when you're watching TV.<br />It makes me laugh to read about those who've found truth and revelation in these books. Though I suppose it's not my place to disabuse the believers of their notion that make believe beings actually have the power to end the world. I just read the series for a few laughs and pass time in a frivolous manner. I'm not going to lose my sleep over an apocalypse, that's for sure.<br />Those looking for religious significance be warned, you might be disappointed. This series is by no means poignant, and even less wise. It's an entertaining tale that will make the authors and their publishers a LOT of money. No wonder it's a bestseller; good for the masses, but those with a higher degree of taste might look elsewhere for more profound fiction. Or borrow from a library, like I did.<br />Take it for what it is, and it won't disappoint because the bottom line is that it's entertaining to a high degree.	2000-11-16

Orson Scott Card is both a religious and philosophical man, and he is definitely not afraid to help himself to those areas when writing his novels. This &quot;sequel&quot; to Ender's Game is arguably the best book in the series, incorporating more advanced elements of drama and tragedy than in Ender's Game. It also comes with a healthy dose of religious and philosophical debate, or as some would put it, debacle.<br />I am strongly atheist yet I did not find his usage of religion at all distasteful. He approaches the subject intelligently, objectively, and passionately. And the sometimes meaningless philosophy dialogues only add to the special tangy flavor that is Orson Scott Card.<br />If you read it to enjoy it, you'll love it. Read it to finish it and you'll like it. Read it to find fault with it, and you'll of course end up hating the thing.	2000-11-16

The problem with fantasy authors these days is that when they write, they set out to write good fantasy. When George R.R. Martin writes, he sets out good literature. What he ends up with is what we've all enjoyed these past four years, excellent quality literature that makes you better for having read it.<br />This series is for an emotionally balanced person. That is, one who can appreciate as well as endure the entire spectrum of emotions. One who is not too dependent upon the good feelings and are vulnerable to the bitter ones. For it is a bittersweet story, filled with despair and hope, grief and joy. All of it good to the very last drop.<br />This series is also not for the squeamish little girls in you. Violence is as real and horrid as it should be. Sex is not overlooked either. Some may find fault in the inclusion of these elements but I assure you that they are not for gratuity's sake. They have purpose, to set the tone for the entire series. They are to make you uncomfortable, for comfort dulls the senses.<br />So that you do not get any misconceptions, this series is not entirely bleak or monotonously disturbing. There is much wonder and mystique, and a sense of romance. It is a well balanced series, with a grim serious tone to it. That very tone however, serves to heighten the aura of magic about the whole series.<br />And lastly, while this series is grim and solemn, it won't damage your psyche or make you a cynical and jaded person. Its entertainment value is still quite high, but not at the cost of its intellectual value. It's a fun read for those with sophisticated taste in epic fantasy. Having said that, beginners to the genre will find it hard to read. There are lighter novels and series which are easier to digest and get into. For those who are disillusioned fantasy grognards, this series will turn you into babbling fools again. For those buying book after book from Jordan or Goodkind, you may be ready to graduate to a higher level of fantasy andbroaden your horizons.<br />If all of this has not convinced you yet, consider this. This series is one of the few, if not the only series to have gotten better with each installment. That's hard to say of very many other series...hint hint.	2000-10-21

This book, if it were a dish, would go down well with no complaints from me but I would not return for second helpings. And I would be grateful that it didn't fill me up too much that I would not able to eat anything else.<br />Bill O'Reilly uses a lot of spice to mask a generally simple and uncomplicated book. You might get a few laughs or nod your head in agreement or shake it with indignation but it won't turn you into a conservative. If this book was a dish, it would destroy the venerable notion of &quot;You are what you eat.&quot;<br />My advice is to watch the TV show or borrow this book from the library. It won't make you a better thinker for having read the book because it's just about as deep as his show. You'll probably be more entertained with the TV version anyhow.<br />To those who commend Bill O'Reilly on his courage in writing his views, I say bleh. What does Bill O'Reilly risk in publishing this book? Nothing. He only has to gain from a possible ratings boost to his show.<br />To sum it all up, this book has no new ideas, scant wit and less wisdom. It won't make any changes or contributions to our society, most likely just a lot of money for Bill O'Reilly. Don't read just for reading's sake.

It is generally accepted that these TV and radio talkshow hosts talk better than they write, so these books can't really be judged upon their own merits. While I think this book isn't as &quot;revelating&quot; or &quot;insightful&quot; as many have to be, it still serves a good purpose.<br />The purpose I mention is to preserve this free speech we all hold dear, at least in our constitution. Realistically, only a few things are free and public speech is not one of them. Free speech is a right that is most important when it protects the least liked views and opinions. While the legality of what Elder has to say is not questioned, the appropriateness is still hotly debated. Major social factions oppose these views and the only way Elder gets away with saying these things is because that's his job! If he were a member of the staff of an all-black college and he publicly stated these ideas, guess what would happen?<br />While I have no illusions as to Larry Elder's wisdom or writing skill, I still have to applaud him for publishing a necessity to the health of this nation and its ideology.<br />America is aging, that is, it is lapsing into meaningless tradition and routine, and developing a potentially harmful general &quot;code of conduct.&quot; A constitution is only a constitution...a reflection of the prevalent attitudes in a society. It can be changed...it has been nearly thirty times already. This book would still be good if it served no other purpose but to remind us in which direction the truth lies.	2000-10-21

While many hold this first book to be a slow beginning, I praise this book  for it! It worked very well at setting up the rest of the series. The  adventure elements between The Two Rivers and Caemlyn were especially a  delight and brought back a little nostalgia of classic adventures such Huck  Finn.<br />The pacing in this book is the best of the series in my opinion. It  lacks the characteristic blandness that plagues many of the following  volumes. While there is some non-sense bickering, it won't annoy you as  much as it will later on. This series is definitely an improvement over  Jordan's previous macho, testosterone filled Conan series. As a matter of  fact, we have some downright PMS'd females. JK.<br />IMNSHO, Jordan is right  now tied for second among active Fantasy writers with Robin Hobb. In the  lead is the Great George Rail Road Martin with his A Song of Ice and Fire  series. The first book of which is A Game of Thrones, followed by A Clash  of Kings, and the very-soon-to-be-published A Storm of Swords. If you're  overly annoyed by Jordan's adolescent characters, read this series.	2000-08-12

It  contains none of the bland mid-game maneuvering of books 5 through 8, and  maintains the adventurous romance of book 1. The pace starts off slowly but  concludes in one of the more unforgetable endings in the series. This book  was the most difficult one to read for me because of its ponderously slow  start but the last third is enthralling. After this one however, the series  takes a generally downward trend.<br />If you really enjoy this series, give  George R.R. Martin a try. His current fantasy series, A Song of Ice and  Fires, is the best yet. It starts with A Game of Thrones, followed by A  Clash of Kings, and the soon-to-be-published A Storm of Swords. And unlike  The WoT recently, every book is better than the last. Worth every penny.	2000-08-12

It is inevitable that the second book in a promising series would be compared to its predecessor. And I realize that not every link in the chain  can be as strong as every other link, when humans are concerned that is.  Nevertheless, I never enjoyed an opera with too many recitatives. A Clash  of Kings is good, but the narrative was not as engaging and less  streamlined than A Game of Thrones. Each episode had the same quality if  not better than A Game of Thrones, but the overall picture was fuzzier.  Meaning you'll be absolutely delighted with particular chapters but won't  like the overall book as much as A Game of Thrones.<br />Of course, this is in  comparison to one of the best modern fantasy books available, and A Clash  of Kings still have much less of the abrupt feel than any Wheel of Time  book I've read.	2000-08-05

If you read this series, try not to get too attached to any particular character; you never know when Martin might kill him/her off. In fact, bet  on it. Martin himself had said, perhaps jokingly, that everybody will be  dead by book 5 and book 6 will be all about snow blowing over graves. The  latter is laughable but the former is all too possible.<br />Even though all  is gloom and doom for everyone of the characters, the reader's sense for  hope is sharpened and any little victory or lucky break shall be savored so  much more. And Martin provides enough of these to pull you through the  engrossing narrative, all the while the big picture always looks grimmer  than before.<br />Martin is no Pulitzer winner, and his writing skill is on  the level with that of a good historian. Nevertheless, he succeeds at  creating a believable setting. He never lets the scenery or the sorcery  interfere with this primarily character driven fantasy.<br />The characters  are the main draw in this story. My favorite is Dany, but maybe that's just  because I am a rather hormonal teenager? His world is good but still bland  given the size of the two volumes I've read. A Storm of Swords just came  out in England so I haven't read it yet. The magical aspects were as  ethereal in the first book as they are here on Earth, but they have come  into play in the second book. I have not been overly impressed with them,  but then, neither am I annoyed with them as I am with some overbearing  magic systems in other fantasy series.<br />It would not be a crime to label A  Song of Ice and Fire as a medieval soap opera, albeit more explicit and  violent, after reading the first two books. However, The general direction  Martin is taking is towards slow development of the fantasy aspects. There  are bigger and better things on the horizon.<br />To wrap it up, I must say  that Martin's frank style attracts me. That is how I like it. He is  objective and does not try to interfere with his characters and their  realities.d their  realities.	2000-08-03
