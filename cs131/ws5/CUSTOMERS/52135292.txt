Nothing is left out; all that has been done is a careful updating of language and sentence structure in order to make the text more readable by a modern audience. Clergy and laity in the traditional Anglican churches would do well to have a copy of this text in their possession in order that they may preserve and pass on Mr. Hooker's wisdom and scholarship.	2005-08-30

The double column presentation of the text made reading and study a bit easier. Some of the motor and sensory pathway figures in the 4th edition were excellent--they were well detailed and presented in an appropriate amount of space on the page.   However, this 5th edition is by far an inferior product.  The text is now single column, and worst of all the once large, eye-catching, and detailed figures are too often shoved over into the margin--in many instances the 4th edition illustrations have been replaced by tiny dumbed-down figures.  I cannot recommend this edition to students or instructors.  A 5 for the text, a 1.5 for the presentation and illustrations.	2005-03-03

Today's Protestants have all but completely forgotten that the Reformation was fought around the issues of the Holy Communion and what it meant. Calvin arrived at the most orthodox answer, in keeping with the Bible and the Church Fathers. However, his followers essentially abandoned Calvin's position on the Eucharist and adopted the \\"memorialism\\" of Zwingli (this was observed in the 1860s by the Anglican theologian and Bishop of Winchester Edward Browne). Mathison takes these individuals and their teachings to task, pointing out that of all of the views on the Communion (the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, and Calvin's) only Zwingli's memorialism stands markedly outside of the Christian tradition. I'd like to comment to Mathison that the Anglican tradition has consistently embraced Calvin's Eucharistic doctrine, by such men as Archbishop Cranmer, the Wesleys, and Bishop Charles Gore (not to mention the offical Articles of Religion of the Church of England). Mathison discusses Lutheran teaching and ignores the Anglican Church and her Reformation doctrines entirely, mentioning Cranmer only in passing.	2003-06-20

This is an excellent revision of the RSV (not actually a new translation, but with the RSV hard to come by this one is actually better), with very helpful cross references, book introductions and footnotes on alternate reading of certain words and phrases. The ESV reads very close to the RSV, KJV, and NKJV, so you can listen to one of the other translations being read and follow along in the ESV with ease. Although I have a feeling this Bible was tailored to evangelical protestants (Anglicans, Presbyterians, Baptists, Lutherans), I also feel that conservative Roman Catholics will also enjoy the translation. There are no \\"partisan\\" study notes to sway people one way or another in the reading of a text (such as those seen in so many KJV, NKJV, and NIV \\"study Bibles\\").  The book introductions follow Church tradition very closely.  The topic headings are traditional as well.  As an example, in the ESV the Magnifcat in Luke is entitled \\"the Magnificat,\\" while the RSV dubs it \\"Mary's Song of Praise.\\" I own both the hardcover and a leather edition of the ESV. The hardcover edition makes an excellent study Bible, lays open flat, and has a good type set that reads easily. An excellent Bible for the money.  However, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, for the ESV to be more useful for conservative Anglicans (as well as Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and students of Scripture) a version with the Apocrypha is needed.  I hope that Crossway will be responsive to this need.  The publishers say that this translation is in the tradition of the KJV; both the KJV and the RSV had the Apocrypha.	2003-02-04

The KJV was a translation meant to stop puritanical influences in the Church of England and gained acceptance only after the failure of the puritan revolution), relying quite a bit on the author's own opinions and prejudices.

So many Christians have the impression that our Bible floated down from the clouds.  This book will open the eyes of many--the New Testament Canon wasn't firmly decided upon until nearly three hundred years after the death of Christ (!).  This is an excellent piece of scholarship, doctrine, and church history.  Not only will readers learn about the Bible, they will also learn about some great theologians of the early Church.  A must read for Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans, Evangelicals and everyone else who wants to understand the Bible and the ancient Christian Church.  Inter Varsity Press publishes this book:  I've been very impressed by many of the scholarly books they have recently published on doctrine (several books by N.T.

MacCulloch seeks to present Archbishop Cranmer as a radical protestant with little scholarly interest or knowledge of the early church, and also that the &quot;via media&quot; of Anglicanism that resulted from the English Reformation was contrary to Cranmer's radical protestant beliefs and is a &quot;myth.&quot;  While MacCulloch may have written a biography he failed to examine the source of Cranmer's beliefs and theology.  MacCulloch claims that Cranmer's eucharistic theology stems from the Swiss Reformed tradition:  one had only to read Basil Hall's essay in &quot;Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar&quot; edited by Ayris and Selwyn to see that this is demonstrably false.  Cranmer was heavily influenced by Lutheranism as well as by the &quot;exposition of the most holy and learned fathers and martyrs&quot; of &quot;the holy catholic church of Christ from the beginning&quot; (Cranmer's words) and as such his theology clearly stands in the same line as that of Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes.  This sort of &quot;scholarship&quot; with an obvious ax to grind is perhaps the worst sort.  If you want to know Cranmer's views on the Sacraments (as most Anglicans or scholars of the Reformation do) please read him in his own words in &quot;A Defense of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ&quot; (if you can find a copy in the library) or in &quot;Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar.&quot;	2001-11-16

This book serves as a needed balance to the biography from MacCulloch that paints Cranmer as a rabid protestant with no real interest in the beliefs of the early church.  It also helps to dispel many of the misconceptions about Cranmer's sacramental theology that are widely held by both &quot;anglo-catholic&quot; and puritan &quot;evangelical&quot; alike.  In these essays Cranmer emerges as the chief reformer of a church that he envisioned as one founded on the Scriptures, the ancient Fathers, and right reason.  Rather than being against the concept of a &quot;via media&quot; church (as MacCulloch claims) Cranmer is the very author of it.	2001-11-16

It traces the way in which Cranmer, Hooker, Laud, Taylor, etc., all sought to conform their thinking to the thought of the Church during the first three to four centuries.  This line of reasoning continued up until the 20th century, when we see Archbishops of Canterbury like Temple and Ramsey, theologians in their own right who defended a distinctively Anglican theology.  The author argues that if world Anglicanism is to stay a viable expression of Christianity it must go back to its roots in an appeal to ancient catholicism, rather than adopting every new secular fad that comes along.  While the writing could be clearer in some places, this book is still a wealth of information on the history of the theology of the  Church of England.  I would recommend it highly to traditionalists in the Anglican Communion as well as to the continuing Anglican Churches.	2001-10-25

While this book (in this and previous incarnations) has been hailed as the &quot;bible&quot; of neuroscience, there are some flaws the potential reader should be made aware of.  The first batch of chapters dealing with the machinery of the cell are repetitive in terms of their respective contents.  Some judicious editing would have been nice in this section.  Although the writing style improves in subsequent chapters, those dealing with the molecular biology of the neuron could be a little clearer.  Levitan and Kaczmarek's &quot;The Neuron&quot; could be used to either introduce or supplement these chapters.  The illustrations throughout are a major improvement over the last edition's over-use of black and white stick figures.

The theories of the Shroud being a masterful painting byDaVinci (ignoring the cruel fact that DaVinci was just a few years oldwhen the Shroud first came to Italy--I don't think he was that bright) or a brilliant early &quot;photograph&quot; of a rotting corpse are even more unbelievable then the possible authenticity of the fabric. Wilson clearly documents the history of the Shroud and every scrap of evidence for its existence back to the time of Jesus--criticisms of Wilson in earlier reviews show that these individuals have not read the text.  He also goes to great lengths to demonstrate that carbon dating results can be (and have been shown to be) skewed due to contamination.  The Shroud itself has been backwoven and repaired several times; any chance this could alter the results?  Other criticisms of Christians appreciating the Shroud as a possible relic or image of Jesus show no knowledge of Christian theology.  Please read the book before you attempt to bash it.	1999-09-01

Based on the one star reviews of this book I expected a &quot;creationist rehash.&quot;  As a biologist trained in animal behavor I read nothing of the kind.  Milton's arguments are clear and well argued; he is at his best  at demonstrating the circular and nonexplanatory arguments used to keep  neo-Darwinian &quot;theory&quot; viable.  A previous negative review tells  the reader to go and read a book on Darwin's finches--Milton devotes a full  chapter to the arguments for &quot;speciation&quot; taken from the finch  research.  The finches of the different islands mate with one another and  are not geograpically isolated from one another--while their beaks may  differ in size and shape the finches are no more separate species than a  poodle is a separate species from a bull dog.  Variation within a species  does not prove neo-Darwinism as &quot;the origin of the species.&quot; To  the potential reader and Mr. Milton (if he reads these reviews),  I would  urge a review of the most recent research of Hall on the specificity of  adaptive mutagenesis and a reading of Ted Steels's new book &quot;Lamarck's  Signature&quot; on retrogenes.  Both lines of research are mentioned  briefly by Milton--I believe a third edition incorporating these new  theories and findings is needed.

This book presents the experimental evidence to date as  to how adaptive immune responses may be incorporated into the DNA of the  organism, thus making them heritable material.   If the retrogene mechanism  is at work in the immune system what other roles might it be playing in  evolution? A huge question for our current understanding of evolution.	1999-03-22

I enjoyed this book; it should be read as a companion to  mathematician/neuroscientist Scott's Stairway to the Mind.  Both authors  take the position of naturalistic dualism (Scott based on emergent  properties and nonlinear mathematics) as well as questioning the role of  quantum physics in consciousness (both see it as just another factor which  still doesn't answer the question).  The book provides a welcome comparison  and criticism of different theories.  Although Chalmers is more honest and  humble in his approach than is Dennet, I still believe we are a long ways  away from uncovering the ultimate nature of conscious awareness.

Dr. Stenger stands in a long line of scientists who hold that any opinion  or belief held outside of scientism is irrational and without merit.

He has a noticeable and intense  disdain for the likes of physicists Penrose (who speaks of the Platonic  realm) and Davies (who dares speak of God, if even as a metaphor); such  &quot;mystics&quot; seem to have no place in true science, since they speak  of &quot;purpose.&quot;  It would seem, according to Stenger, that such ill  conceived notions stem from a misinterpreation of quantum facts, and that  the existing laws of science are entirely sufficient in explaining the  universe (those anomolies that science can't reckon with are either  misunderstood or nonexistent).

No.	From a neurobiologist: Dr.  Behe provides a scathing evaluation of the  evidence for evolution.  Most of his detractors take the most offense to  his theistic implications, and indeed this is where his greatest weakness  can be found (although it is intersting to note that atheism in academia  seems laudable in and out of the classroom, while any note of theism is  taken as an intellectual weakness) .  However, many of these detractors  offer up Kauffman's self-organization theories to defend evolution--while  failing to note that this in no way defends the neo-Darwinian sythesis.  If  Behe had kept his critical aim at neo-Darwinism in particular instead of  evolution in general (in considering macroevolution) his work would have  been more convincing.  Any evolutionary biologist with knowledge of the  mechanisms of sensory evolution, adaptive mutations, epigenetic  inheritance, as well as the growing evidence against gradualism (see  Science, vol 267, 1995), can tell you that simple neo-Darwinism isn't the  whole story.  However, we don't need God to come down to fill in the gaps  -- Nature can do that for herself, even  if neo-Darwinian theory can't.   This I believe, makes Nature all the more fascinating.	1998-09-07
