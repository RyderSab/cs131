The contrast between the dialogue and the passages belonging to the author is very remarkable. The humble origin of all four main characters explains their actions. Mercanariness and carnal desire serve as guidelines for the brutish instincts. However, the end of the play, when Abby kills her newborn to prove that her love is above her self-interest elevate the play to the sublime realms.	2005-08-04

He lives away from his parents, with his grandfather and the extended family. His views of the world run contrary to the reality that he sees and therefore he perishes. His death is very dramatic, since he believes in the old legend of a mother-deer, in the existence of a white ship and in turning into a fish.

Welles in a sense that Earth dwellers here fight against strange creatures. Unlike \\"the War of the Worlds\\", however, it is not mentioned anywhere where Xepehuz came from. Nevertheless, if to take into account that the story was written in 1896, it is amazing how the author could foresee all those technological inventions, because here Xepehuz resemble structures with a cybernetic  equipment with a crystal-like structure that can project a lazar and incinerate other objects at a distance.    At the same time, the lack of Xepehuz's sociability is pernicious for humans, which makes the coexistence impossible, and, consequently, the war inevitable. That is why Xepehuz were destined to perish.    There is a reason why the events take place in the remote past, instead of the distant future. It shows that a primitive man was able to comprehend the structure of sophisticated creatures and therefore emerged as a winner in spite of heavy losses.	2005-04-06

It shows the life in all its forms. The last two sentences of the novel give a philosophical description of the role of money and why so many vices are tied with it.     The novel shows how easy it was in those days to take a roller-coaster ride from poverty to richness and back to poverty. It narrates about early days of capitalism, when no antitrust regulations existed. One should also bear in mind that all the utopian talk of Sigizmund Busch about classless society and money becoming obsolete was seen (from the way it is conveyed in the novel) as daydreaming.     The novel walks through such important events of the XIXth century as: the Mexican expedition, building of the Suez Canal, the Austro-Italian War, the Prussian conquest of small duchies and the Paris World Exhibition of 1867. Shortly after all these events France was struck by the infamous Dreyfus Affair and the novel does a good job describing the atmosphere that led to it, because there is hardly a chapter where the main character does not make inflammatory statements about the Jews.     All in all, it is a classic novel, not only about the money, but about the humanity, as well.	2005-04-05
US	42644688	R2BNJZZ6WFDHAT	0140442804	986794591	The Debacle	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A War Classic	The Franko-Prussian War of 1870-71 was one of the most important wars of the XIXth century. It brought the downfall of the Second Empire in France and the unification of all German lands (excluding Austria) under the hegemony of Prussia. The inevitability of the war resulted in strengthening of Prussia after its victory against Austria in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, which gave Prussia some new territories and put it in the head of Northern German Alliance. Prussia became a military power, which threatened the continental hegemony of France and the political prestige of Napoleon III, undermined by failures and setbacks in both foreign and internal policies. France entered the war totally unprepared both diplomatically and militarily. In several weeks her army was crushingly defeated and the emperor himself, with a portion of his army, was taken prisoner. On September 4 in Paris the Monarchy was overthrown and the Republic was proclaimed.  <br /> <br />These events are described in this classic war novel. The emphasis is laid on the plight of solders and ordinary people. Few other war novels succeed at capturing so well the burden that the ordinary people carry at the time of war. Thus, in WAR AND PEACE war scenes are watered down with peace scenes and many subsequent war novels, such as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, are just not as multidimensional. LE DEBACLE/THE DOWNFALL is a real melting pot of heroes and cowards, devotees and traitors, destitutes and looters. All that is seen not only in the conflict of the French against the Prussians, but also during the Paris Commune, to which the last chapters of the novel are devoted.  <br />	2005-01-20

George Sand's novels, however, usually have a happy ending. There are exceptions still; for example those who have read a lot of George Sand would recall that the ending of \\"Indiana\\" is somewhat bittersweet. The ending of  \\"Page d'Amour/Love Episode\\" is also bittersweet in a sense that Helene Grandjean's daughter dies, but Helene marries the man who loves her.     The story is still too trite. Even historians say that Zola, who himself called this novel \\"syrupy\\", wrote it to quiet the critics, who accused him of scavenging dirty themes in \\"l'Assommoir/the Drum Shop\\".  Lastly, it is important to note that after \\"Page d'Amour/Love Episode\\" Zola went on to \\"scavenge\\" another dirty theme in the novel \\"Nana\\".	2004-09-04

In a melodrama there is a polarization of good and evil; both are shown with an exaggerated acuteness and feelings that go along are overdramatized. In \\"Pot-Bouille/Pot Lock\\" the characters are very real and down-to-earth. The novel features sex, adulteries, self-seeking, self-advancement, hypocrisy, religion, greed, fight over inheritance, jealousy, show-boating, children born out of wedlock, etc.  All of that happens among the inhabitants of the same building. The last utterance in the novel (delivered by one of the servants) shows the typical nature of the late XIXth century Parisian building, which is splendidly beautiful on the outside (referring to the beginning of chapter I). A fine-looking housekeeper, who stands on guard of morals, is an embodiment of sanctimony.    The novel is somewhat loosely tied with the sequel story about Octave Mouret \\"Au Bonheur des Dames/the Ladies' Delight\\". Both are masterpieces in their own rights and can be enjoyed independently of one another.	2004-08-07

Visiting the Louvre museum (in chapter III) shows how the lower social classes interprete the centuries-old culture. This very lack of culture is the reason for the alcohol addiction and other vises portrayed in \\"l'Assomoir/the Drum Shop\\". It also explains the underdevelopment of the class-consciousness.       Only as late as chapter X Gervaise starts drinking, but she soon becomes addicted to it, which reflects not only the poor living conditions, but also her ancestry (referring to the novels \\"la fortune des Rougons/the fortune of Rougons\\" and \\"Doctor Pascal\\").       There is a very brief mention (early in the novel) of Gervaise's sister Lisa from the novel \\"La Ventre de Paris/the Underbelly of Paris\\", but Gervaise never gets into any contacts with her; that explains that the social status plays a more important role than the family ties.      There are interesting depictions of Nana, the 'heroine' of the novel with the same title. In chapter V there are some glimpses of Nana as a small girl and chapter XI shows more mature Nana...      Guijet is a somewhat controversial character. He is a lot different from everybody else in a positive way but it is questionable whether sobriety and hard work alone can shelter someone from all the abjective influences; environmental factors also play a big role.	2004-06-19

Its only drawback is in giving a somewhat shallow coverage of every individual area of communication. This should be attributed mainly to the nature of multilingual (in this case qatralingual) dictionaries.

Its scenes recreate very well the atmosphere of the late days of the Second Empire. Jacques Lantier is the main character, but the novel is not at all centered around him or his urge to kill women; only as late as chapter eight he attempts to commit a violent act and it is as late as chapter eleven that he does commit a violent act. The abundance of adultery, police incompetence, two single murders (chapters one and twelve), a multiple murder (chapter ten) both committed purely out of jealousy and an uxoricide committed out of greed all show the living environment and the morale of those days. Definitely, one of the major novels of the Rougon-Macquart series.	2004-04-15

The novel is more about him and his niece than about his musing on the heredity theory. All his scientific talks show no more than just one side of his personality, because showing that a certain physiological or a psychological anomaly passes either directly or indirectly from ascendants to descendants is a purely scientific task. A novel can show no proofs, only examples of such passing. Thus, Angelique Rougon in \\"Le Reve/The Dream\\", Pauline Quenu in \\"La Joie de Vivre/Zest for Life\\" and, in particular Jeanne Grandjean in \\"Une Page d'Amour/A Love Episode\\" clearly inherited a neurotic illness from their great-grand-mother Adelaide Fouque. And three members of the generation below (sons of Maxime Rougon, Nana and Claude Lantier) died in their childhood of various diseases, which shows complete family degeneracy. A more direct passing would be Gervaise Macquart's (\\"l'Assommoir/the Drum Shop\\")addiction to alcohol, which she inherited from her father Antoine, who died of a spontaneous ignition in a drunken stupor. However, there is no explanation either in any of the novels or in the genealogical tree how such phlegmatic and mercenary-minded people as Lisa Quenu and her husband (\\"Le Ventre de Paris/The Underbelly of Paris\\") produced such a joyous, generous and selfless daughter Pauline (\\"La Joie de Vivre/Zest for Life\\") or how Francois and Marthe Mouret, Adelaide Fouque's grandchildren, who die after losing their sanity (\\"La Conquete de Plassans/The Conquest of Plassans\\") and who produced a feeble-minded daughter and a neurotic son, whose disease developed into mysticism (\\"La faute de Abbe Mouret/The Sin of Father Mouret\\"), could along with that produce such an vigorous and business-minded son Octave (\\"Pot-Bouille/Pot Luck\\" and \\"Au Bonheur des Dames/\\"the Ladies' Paradise\\"). What makes it particularly hard to explain the genetic influence is the fact that family members (especially in late Rougon-Macquart novels) interact with each other little if any. Thus, three Lantier brothers seem totally alien to each other and their parents, Angelique Rougon \\"Le Reve/The Dream\\" is brought up under no influence of her mother Sidonie, Helene Grandjean (\\"Une Page d'Amour/A Love Episode\\") never has any contact with her brother Francois and Jean Macquart (\\"La Terre/The Earth\\" and \\"La Debacle/The Downfall\\") with his sisters Lisa and Gervaise. Furthermore, if to look at environment vs. heredity, things turn out to be in favor of the former, because there are characters who undergo a personality change. Thus, Octave Mouret in \\"Au Bonheur des Dames/The Ladies' Paradise\\" is a lot different from Octave in \\"Pot-Boille/Pot Luck\\", Arstide Saccard in \\"L'Argent/The Money\\" from Arstide in \\"La Curee/The Kill\\". Therefore, the heredity theory in Zola's novels is portrayed to a much lesser degree than the history of the French society under Napoleon III.	2004-03-04

However, some 150 years ago, under the reign of Napoleon III, the rural France went through a lot of turmoil. The long-lasting patriarchal traditions were broken away. The period in history, which Zola himself called in the preface to the novel \\"la Fortune des Rougons/the Fortune of Rougons\\" \\"the strange era of madness and shame\\" not only perverted the city-dwellers, but also brutalized the villagers. That is why the novel abounds with scenes of rape, incest, cupidity  and squabbles. There are also very graphic scenes of matricide (part 3, chapter 2), patricide (part 5, chapter 5), filicide (part 5, chapter 2) and sororicide (part 5, chapter 3). Eventually it turned out that villagers can not live in peace not only in the world of the living, but also in the world of the beyond (part 5, chapter 6). If there are other ironic passages of this novel it would be a marital proposal being made on a dunghill (part 4, chapter 6), a spontaneous child delivery (part 3, chapter 5) or a family that sets up and runs a whorehouse tries to bring up an orderly girl. However, laughs and ironies here are muffled by beastly instincts of the characters of this novel, which is the second to \\"la Bete Humaine/the Beast in Man\\" most violent Rougon-Macquart novel. <br />Among other things: here Zola had a great opportunity to create a noble savage, but he did not use it. In fact, in all the Rougon-Macquart novels, even the best characters (not only the members of the Rougon-Macquart family) have something preconceived in them, which prevents them from becoming classical literary figures. One should look for an explanation to that partly Zola's theoretical views, partly in his personal nature and partly in the history of his novels.<br />Jean Macquart produces a rather positive impression. Later, the novel \\"la Debacle/the Downfall\\" will complete a picture of him and show that, unlike many,he fought with fortitude during the war and did not betray his country.	2004-02-14

Secondly, in spite of being published over 20 years ago and never being revised (several stereotype editions have come out), it does an excellent job covering the the basic technical terminology that is still used. It may be outdated in its covering some rapidly growing technical fields such as: electrical engineering, digital technology, information technology, etc. (which is OK, because other reference manuals have made up for this deficiency) but it is comprehensive enough for a dictionary of its type in covering physics, chemistry, geology, civil engineering, space exploration, etc. Furthermore, it is not as cumbersome as the four-volumed polytechnical dictionary published by RUSSO several years ago.  Therefore, the dictionary can serve  technical translators well enough and for the native Russian speakers it is a great way to become familiar with the English technical terminology and vice versa.	2004-01-07

The plot in which a painter first falls in love with a countess, but later is tormented by his love for her daughter, because the daughter bears a physical resemblance of the mother (in her juvenile period the daughter looked absolutely identical to the mother, when the painter's love toward the latter started to grow) gives a lot of material for musing on the topic of love. The title is borrowed from the Bible, where the love is said to be as \\"strong as death\\". Nevertheless, the main idea here seems to be not that people of art tend to fall desperately in love and that their love may take eccentric forms, but that delving into something monotonous allows no room for novelty and, consequently, may destroy creative forces.	2003-12-05

Instead, it is Albine, a niece of an old man, who occupies a once abandoned and then burned down palace, surrounded by survived flourishing gardens and cascades, with whom Serge develops a full-fledged love relationship. Nevertheless, torn between carnal desires and religious prejudices, Serge abandons Albine and the profuse Paradou garden and returns to the church. He ends up being guilty in the death of his beloved. <br />The question is: what is Serge Mouret's fault? Is it in him betraying the postulates of religion or in him abandoning the earthly joys? We see two outlooks on life. The first outlook is renouncing everything earthly in the name the Beyond. The second outlook is the joyous perception of life and admiring the world and the nature in all its diversity. <br />Mouret is torn between the two outlooks and his internal struggle ends with a fault, but not against the religious dogma, rather, against sensuous joys. One must say that there are things in life other than the utopian Paradou. The Artaud village, which it neighbors is populated with savage people. Their brutish instincts contradict the beauty of life. So, which is right? Is it the religion and the Beyond or is it the diverse life, in which brutish and lyrical things coexist? The symbolic end of the novel (Albine's death and Serge Mouret's retarded sister Desiree proclaiming with joy the birth of a calf) convincingly proves the superiority of the material perception of the everyday life over religious superstitions.	2003-09-07

Even when events in his novels or stories took place in the distant past or in the fantastically created future, he wrote about what he had lived through. His renowned novel \\"Demian\\" is very much autobiographical. The story \\"Child's Soul\\" may be the only thing ever written by Hesse, which is more autobiographical than \\"Demian\\". The narrating person in \\"Child's Soul\\" does not have a mental equilibrium. He can not draw a line between good and evil, between love and destruction; his mental state is characterized by fear. Nonetheless, he only sees the \\"chaos\\" and takes its existence into consideration. His future fate is unknown, but there we see a sparkle of hope that he will gain a foot-hold and achieve the state of mental equilibrium. PS: the term \\"chaos\\" was used by Hesse himself in one of his articles. [Rating: 5/5]    KLEIN AND WAGNER: An uxoricide and a filicide escapes from Germany to Italy to find peace for his tormented soul. He finds there death, however. Unlike the narrating person in the story described above, here we know for sure that Klein self-destructs. This story, especially, is laden with philosophical passages. Here (and in the story described bellow, as well) we see how Hesse uses associations; \\"klein\\" is the German adjective that stands for \\"small\\" and Wagner is not only the name of another uxoricide and filicide, but also that of a famous composer, whose music is tied in Klein's imagination with eroticism of his youth. [Rating: 5/5]    KLINGSOR'S LAST SUMMER: a story of a dying painter, who, as we know from the preface, is only forty-two years old. In this case, the name Klingsor comes from one epic poem that dates back to the seventh century. In that poem Klingsor was a magician, which suggest some sort of kinship between the art and the magic. This particular story is somewhat ambiguously written, even Klingsor's death remains ambiguous. One can not say with a certainty whether Klingsorcommitted a suicide, even though the whole mood of this story is imbued with ideas of life's frailty and death's imminence. This ambiguous narration (which Hesse employed in many of his works) does capture the atmosphere in which Klingsor spent his last days (and perhaps most of his life), but it bears a mark of abstractness.

In spite of occasional thriftiness, which is, perhaps, the result of being brought up by her mother Lisa Quenu (\\"La Ventre de Paris/the Underbelly of Paris\\"), she is possessed with boundless generosity. She sacrifices her money and her personal life to care for her extended family. Along with that, she gives money and food to poor children. She suffers from occasional fits of anger, which is something that was, probably, passed down to her by her great-grandmother Adelaide Fouque (\\"la Fortune des Rougons/the Fortune of the Rougons\\"), but still she is in love with life. This zest for life necessitates all the action for the good of mankind. Her craving for knowledge and progress is not realized, however, because she devotes everything to caring for others. <br />Contrasted with Pauline is her cousin Lazare. He is angry at the entire world for not recognizing him. He attributes all his failures to some large conspiracy directed against him by people and circumstances. All his desires for knowledge and action fail.

As it is described in the first Rougon-Macquart novel \\"la Fortune des Rougons/the Fortune of the Rougons\\" Arstide had not been able to predict at the decisive moment the victory of the Empire and therefore decided not to build a political career for himself, but instead to become rich through fraudulent speculations. Aristide Saccard is a character that embodies traits of many associates of Napoleon III. We see some insights into how the city of Paris was changing its appearance late in the XIXth century and what role were associates and supporters of Napoleon III playing in it. We also see that the Second Empire produced not only tenacious and active predators, like most of the Aristide Saccard's encirclement, but also spoiled and coddled parasites. Such are Aristide Saccard's oldest son Maxime and second wife Renee. <br />That is all if viewed independently of the Rougon-Macquart epic. If to view this novel as a part of the Rougon family history, it just makes it more complete. We also learn how Aristide Saccard's sister Sidonie earns her living by exploiting human weaknesses. Aristide Saccard's brother Eugene Rougon is also a character of this novel, though appears very sporadically here. Basically, however, most of the ideas of this novel are better conveyed in the subsequent Rougon-Macquart novels. <br />Last, but not least, the story of Aristide Saccard is far from over; there is a lot more to come in the novel \\"l'Argent/the Money\\".	2003-03-02

IT IS THE FIRST ROUGON-MACQUART NOVEL AND IT PORTRAYS THE RISE OF THE SECOND EMPIRE WITH THE SAME FORCE AS ZOLA'S RENOWN NOVEL \\"LA DEBACLE/THE DOWNFALL\\" (THE NINETHEENTH IN THE ROUGON-MACQUART EPIC) PORTRAYS ITS DEMISE. HAVING SAID THAT, ONE MUST ADD THAT IN THE FRENCH LITERATURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, ZOLA'S ROUGON-MACQUART EPIC IS AS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE FRENCH SOCIETY UNDER NAPOLEON III AS BALZAC'S \\"LA COMEDIE HUMAINE/THE COMEDY OF HUMAN LIFE\\" IS TO UNDERSTANDING THE FRENCH SOCIETY UNDER LOUIS-PHILIPPE, EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER CONSISTS OF 97 NOVELS, WHEREAS THE FORMER CONSISTS OF ONLY 20 AND FURTHERMORE, ONLY 19 NOVELS IN THE ROUGON-MACQUART EPIC DIRECTLY REFLECT THE PERIOD IN HISTORY BETWEEN 1852 AND 1870, BECAUSE ZOLA NEEDED THE NOVEL \\"DOCTOR PASCAL\\" TO EXPRESS HIS VIEWS ON THE HEREDITY THEORY.<br />UNLIKE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE ROUGON-MACQUART NOVELS, IN WHICH EVENTS TAKE PLACE IN PARIS, A SMALL SOUTHERN TOWN CALLED PLASSANS IS CHOSEN AS A SETTING. IN REALITY SUCH TOWN DOES NOT EXIST, IT IS ONLY INTENDED TO RESEMBLE A PLACE CALLED \\"L'AIX\\", WHERE ZOLA SPENT MOST OF HIS CHILDHOOD. <br />IT SHOWS HOW PIERRE ROUGON (THE OLDEST SON OF ADELAIDE FOUQUE) MAKES A CAREER FOR HIMSELF, HIS WIFE AND TWO OF HIS SONS DURING THE COUP D'ETAT. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF HIS RISE, WE WITNESS A TRAGIC FATE OF HIS NEPHEW SILVERE AND SILVERE'S BELOVED MIETTA. THEY DIE YOUNG FOR THEIR IDEALS.<br />THE SUBSEQUENT NOVELS WILL SHOW VARIOUS SIDES OF LIFE UNDER NAPOLEON III. ADELAIDE FOUQUE'S GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN WILL EITHER BE MAIN CHARACTERS OR AT LEAST PLAY A SECONDARY ROLE IN ALL OF THEM. MANY OF THESE CHARACTERS WILL POSSESS INNATE VICES OF DIFFERENT KINDS. FOR EXAMPLE, GERVAISE MACQUART'S ADDICTION TO ALCOHOL IN \\"L'ASSOMOIR/THE DRAM SHOP\\" TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEUROSIS DEVELOPED BY HER SONS CLAUDE (\\"L'OUVRE/THE MASTERPIECE\\") AND JACQUES (\\"LA BETE HUMAINE/THE BEAST IN MAN\\") ARE ALL HEREDETARY. THE SAME GOES FOR THE DEPRAVED NATURE OF GERVAISE'S DAUGHTER NANA IN \\"NANA\\". ADELAIDE FOUQUE'S GRANCHILDREN FRANCOIS MOURET AND MARTA ROUGON (\\"LA CONQUET DES PLASSANS/THE CONQUEST OF PLASSANS\\") DIE AFTER GOING INSANE, LIKE THEIR GRANDMOTHER. <br />WE LEARN FROM THE SECOND CHAPTER OF THIS NOVEL THAT NOT ONLY ADELAIDE FOUQUE HERSELF, BUT HER FATHER AS WELL WAS INSANE. THEREFORE, ADELAIDE FOUQUE IS NOT THE ORIGIN OF THE VICES THAT RUN IN THE FAMILY. NONETHELESS, THE GENEALOGICAL TREE OF THE ROUGON-MACQUART FAMILY INCLUDED IN THE NOVEL \\"DOCTOR PASCAL\\" BEGINS WITH HER.	2002-12-29

A cynical \\"Figaro\\" journal columnist<br />12. A pimp who employs his own wife as a prostitute<br />13. Numerous women who earn their living the same way Nana does<br />The novel is very loosely tied with the Rougon-Macquart family tree. We only know (from chapter II) that both of Nana's parents are already dead and all throughout the novel Nana does not get in any contact with her three half-brothers. Only in chapter X, when Nana entertains her guests, she talks a little about her background. However, to find out where Nana came from, one must read \\"L'Assommoir/the Drum Shop\\".<br />Some think that the novel is exaggerated almost to the point of grotesque. But the truth is that it is not; it gives an honest portrayal of the French society late under Napoleon III. \\"Nana\\" (especially chapter XIV) serves as a great prelude to the novel \\"la Debacle/the Downfall\\", though the two are completely different from one another in theme and the former was published in 1880 and is #9 in the R.-M. cycle, whereas the latter was published in 1892 and is #19 in the R.-M. cycle.	2002-11-27

In the sequence of novels it is preceded by \\"la Terre/the Earth\\" and followed by \\"la Bete Humain/the Beast in Man\\" - two very significant novels in the cycle. Therefore, one may think of \\"le Reve/the Dream\\" as some sort of respite. It is a story of tragic love of Angelique Rougon and the local bishop's son. The novel is well written, but is too imbued with religious theme and too one-dimensional to be ranked as high as other Zola's novels. It is important to point out that contacts between relatives, even though somewhat present in early Rougon-Macquart novels, are completely absent in later ones and \\"le Reve/the Dream\\" is a striking example of that. Early in the novel Angelique is adopted by a couple of church embroiderers. The husband in the family decides to find out something about Angelique's mother prior to taking care of official formalities related to adoption, but after learning that she (Sidonie Rougon from \\"la Cur(e')e/the Kill\\") does shady and precarious things to earn her living, he tells Angelique that her mother is dead. Therefore, Angelique never learned the truth about her family, which makes \\"le Reve/the Dream\\" one of the several novels in the cycle, which is only outwardly tied with the genealogical tree of the Rougon-Macquart family.	2002-11-23

Flaurent is a runaway convict, who lives in his half brother's shop, which is a part of the big Parisian market. Flaurent is a former school teacher, who had had no interest in politics, but once, during the coup d'etat in December of 1851, while walking along the street came under police fire and had his hands smudged in dead woman's blood. That is how he got sentenced to hard labor. There is a sharp contrast between him and most of the other characters in the novel...<br />The novel is somewhat draggy at times and gossips with squabbles take up lots of passages, but one must bear in mind that in the Rougon-Macquart epic Zola was trying to create the broadest possible picture of the French society under Napoleon III. That is why, besides the Parisian market, the epic narrates about: big shops defeating small ones (\\"Au Bonheur des dames/Ladies Paradise\\"), miners (\\"Germinal\\"), the stock exchange (\\"Argent/Money\\"), etc.	2002-10-24

However, because of financial difficulties, the uncle is unable to provide any backing. Denise ends up being hired by the owner of a giant retail store - his name is Octave Mouret and he is one of the thirteen great grandchildren of Adelaide Fouque - which establishes a monopoly on all the products that are intended to meet the needs and the tastes of women. That monopoly brings misery to small establishments, like that of Denise's uncle, which are located around. Nonetheless, Denise is fascinated with the size of the store and its owner. At one time she is terminated, but then hired back ...<br />The novel describes in great details the way the store operates, the way the people who work there live, the way women do their shopping. These digressions tend to slow down the plot development, but they are not harmful to the novel itself, since they provide a great insight into the morals and manners of the upper class and into the early concepts of the modern economic system. The novel was written in 1883 and we can see that even though the economic system that was in place than resembles the one that is in place now, such things as stiff competition, struggle between monopolies and small businesses, conflicts between coworkers and greed for power were much more conspicuous, as it is seen from the novel. One must bear in mind that professional unions were only gaining strength at that time. <br />Also, Octave Mouret is one of the most interesting characters in the Rougon-Macquart cycle. In spite of the fact that his parents (who are cousins to one another) die insane in \\"the Conquest of Passans/la Conquete de Plassans\\", he remains vigorous, jovial and practical. Furthermore, he is one of the very few characters in the cycle who undergoes some sort of personality change, since in this novel he is a lot different from himself in the novel \\"Pot Luck/Pot-Bouille\\", but that is a different story.	2002-10-01

It is considered to be a lyrical prelude to his major novel \\"the Counterfeiters\\", published seven years later. This story is similar to \\"the Counterfeiters\\" in a way that it explores the falsehood that exists in the relationships between people.    The story tells about a rural pastor, who adopts, out of mercy, an orphaned girl, whose condition is further aggravated by the fact that prior to becoming an orphan, she had been living with an elderly and somewhat deaf aunt; therefore, she is not adept in understanding the language that people speak and the connection that exists between words and perceptions. The pastor undertakes the responsibility of educating the blind girl - her name is Gertrude - in accordance with the methods that are used to educate the blind. At the same time, the relationships within the pastor's family grow complex ...     This story is a rebellion against rigours of religious postulates. At one time it enjoyed a great popularity in author's native France and in 1946 its screen version was released. However, the likelihood that the story, the way it is described, could take place indeed is somewhat low. Not only the believability of the plot line is questionable, the emotions seem to be overdramatised. \\"The Counterfeiters\\" does not share these drawbacks, though.	2002-09-16

In spite of its complex structure, the novel is very captivating. It has lots of insights into the structure of the society (most of the chapters are supplemented by a digression, which contains the society's description through rules, regulations or postulates) and at the same time the story is very suspenseful. It is a lot like mystery-type read, because till the very end of the last chapter the story is intense and unpredictable. <br />In addition to that, there is a lot of social satire: it shows how people's emotions are suppressed, how the ruling elite controls the majority, how the society aspires to achieve perfection by making every member of it perform the assigned duties and by not allowing anybody to deviate from the set standards. All of that is because computers and operating machines are on the foreground and everything else (people, in the first place) is reduced to the background.<br />The novel is centered around a rebellion against this super organized and super computerized machine, which goes as far as assigns each individual his or her distinguishing mark (each letter of the alphabet in a descending order represents belonging to a certain social rank ). Without revealing much more, let us end up with saying that the topic of fantastically created worlds of the future has lots of potentials and those potentials are reached in this short novel.	2002-07-23

The development of the main character is too one-dimensional and I find Kamala and Govinda even more uninteresting than Siddhartha himself.<br />What I dislike the most about this novel is that it tends to eclipse everything else written by Hesse. I am looking right now at the Bantham Books edition and I see that it says on the front cover: \\"his most famous novel\\" and on the back it is written that \\"... Herman Hesse' most famous and influential work\\". I find these statements to the utmost misleading, because those who know anything about Hesse are aware of the fact that it was the Glass Bead Game that won him the Nobel Prize. It is his most monumental work and, truly one of the best novels of the 20-th century. However, I am not going to compare it with Siddhartha, because they are too different. Instead it would be easier to compare it with the Steppenwolf by Hesse.<br />Both novels have a clearly defined protagonist. However, Harry Haller from the Steppenwolf seems to be more flesh-made, interesting and easier to identify with than Siddhartha, because the Steppenwolf discusses an individual vs. society, while Siddhartha is centered exclusively around religion. What annoyed me the most in Siddhartha is that every move that he made was influenced by religion. Even his relationship with other people (Govinda, Kamala, his son and others) was dictated by religion. By no means I am trying to blame the author for that or say that it is a bad book; instead, it is the theme itself that imposed those restrictions. In Steppenwolf, even though there is a lot of grotesque, the protagonist is much more part of reality.<br />There is another novel by Hesse that I would rank higher than Siddhartha. It is called Demian. Although, it is a lot different from Siddhartha (completely different time, characters, setting), it is written in a similar vein as Siddhartha (at least, it is possible to tell that the two are written by the same author). I will make it bold to say that its two main characters, Max Demian and Emil Sinclair, are much more interesting to look at than Siddhartha.<br />To sum everything up, Siddhartha is merely a reflection of Hesse's interest in India. In fact, from Hesse's biography it is known that since he settled in Switzerland in 1919, if not to count brief departures to Italy and Germany, India is the only place he ever visited till his death in 1962. If I remember it right, Hesse wrote a few other books on India and the Hinduism, besides Siddhartha, but all of them put together are only a portion of his literary achievementssimilar vein as Siddhartha (at least, it is possible to tell that the two are written by the same author).

Not only the Mysterious Island shares the same characters with the two novels mentioned above, it also tells what is left untold in those novels. Therefore, if you have not read either  20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or Captain Grant's Children prior to reading the Mysterious Island, you may not understand where certain things originate in the Mysterious Island. <br />Luckily, the Mysterious Island and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea are readily available in bookstores and libraries. However, that is not the case with Captain Grant's Children.

It is true that it is not the best novel written by Jules Verne, but it is still interesting. It has a scientific element in it (the idea of a ship-like structure that is about the size of a small island is not too far-fetched), characters  who you can identify with or find interesting, cultural and anthropological insights into various islands in the Pacific Ocean, humor and social satire. In fact, I would rank it higher than most of the books in the bookstores' Science Fiction section.	2002-07-10
