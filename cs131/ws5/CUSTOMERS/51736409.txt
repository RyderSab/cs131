In it, Wise Child- the main charecture- loses her last remaining family and is \\"sold\\" to Juniper, who everyone thinks is a witch. During her time with Juniper, Wise Child learns many things, not just mathematics and english, but the wonderful things in the world and how to embrace all things. I'm not saying this book is all mushy and the \\"we must love all things\\" kind of book, but it really teaches you to see the best in others and in other living things. It does lack some detail, you really have to use your imagintation more... although I never mind doing so, but it does make it harder to see things the same way Ms. Furlong does.  <br />It is a wonderful read, I can only say it is one of the most wonderful and insightful books I have ever read. And that's saying a lot.	2005-06-29

You certainly wrote a wonderful book!<br /><br />I first picked up Eragon because I liked the way the cover looked. I have never regreted that move, as soon as I finished the first chapter I was sold. He has a way of letting you know just enough that you don't get frustrated, but you are still curoius. He makes you feel as though you are there, the chapter in which he first flies was when I truly noticed how I felt I was riding Saphira, instead of Eragon.<br /><br />I will say this book gets a little slow at parts, a few times you just say \\"C'mon! Keep going!\\" But it always picks up quickly again. Mr. Paolini makes the whole book seem real, from the way he describes the snow and the mountains, to what is going on in the story I can only say pick it up, you won't be dissapointed.	2005-06-26

It is also quite funny at times. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fantastic, thrilling, adventurious book, and who likes to become friends with the charectures!	2005-01-08

I fully expect to be hanged, drawn, quartered for this, and possibly stoned too, but nevertheless, I'm going to grit my teeth and say it- I didn't care very much for this book.<br />Yep, I can see it now, the legions of devoted Pullman fans racing down to tar and feather me. But please, before you begin, hear me out.<br />This was not a bad book. It certainly was not the worst I have ever read, but it was by no means the best. I have read worse fantasy, but I have also read much, much better books from the same genre. What didn't I like?<br />Well, first off, the alternate universe thing confused me. Lyra, the heroine, lives in this weird sort of other universe, which is very similar to our own, except that everyone in it has a daemon, a sort of \\"visible soul.\\" The result of this is that Oxford, London, and zeppelins will be mentioned almost in the same sentence as daemons and anbaric lights. This creates a strange, surreal universe, that contains no depth, reality, or believability. There is no sense of an actual living, breathing world, with the result that the characters cease to be real, concrete people, and their adventures become silly and improbable. Now granted, this is fantasy we're talking about here, so the events in the story are not going to be typical things that could happen to anybody anytime. But compare this world with the wonderful Middle Earth of Tolkien's books. Middle Earth is real, it is concrete. It is replete with different cultures, each with their own language, history, mythology, and customs. It is belivable, so that its characters and their adventures are also belivable. When reading Tolkien, I have no problem beliving that the hobbit Frodo is being pursued by evil black horsemen to the house of wise and beautiful elves. When reading Pullman, I cannot bring myself to believe that Lyra is floating in a hot air balloon above a country full of talking bears. It doesn't ring true.<br />Another thing I didn't like was the characters. Lyra started out all right, as a fun loving, spunky tomboy. But she quickly lost her sparkle and faded to an unremarkable character. I ceased to care that much about what happened to her. That was the problem I had with most of the characters. They all had some defining traits, yes, but were not nearly as varied and diverse as in other books. And as for Lord Asriel- he's consistently portrayed as being noble and honorable, with pure and academic motives. yet he conceives a child with a married woman he never weds, murders her husband, conducts hideous experiments on children, betrays his daughter, and kidnaps her friend. What's wrong with this picture?<br />This book was all right. The beginning was very good, and it did hold my interest enough so that I finished it. But even then, by the time I got to the end I was starting to grow bored with the whole thing, read the last pages hurriedly. It gave me a little enjoyment, but I don't feel any pressing need, or really any need at all, to read the sequels. The flatness and unreality of the world and its characters don't encourage me to continue reading this series. My advice to prospective readers? It's all right, but you're much better off with the far superior \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"rted out all right, as a fun loving, spunky tomboy.

Judy Blume has a way of writing that is unlike anything else. In this book Margaret moves to a new town, where she meats 3 very nice girls, who turn out to be good friends except for one problem; these girl are all into growing up, getting their periods, and having thier breasts develope. Margaret feals emabarresed because she is still \\"flat\\" and she doesn't feal like she is going to start her period any time soon. Margaret decides to talk to God about her troubles. She talks to him like a friend and it helps her.<br />One day Margaret is invited to a party, by a boy in her class who really likes her. He invited the whole class, when Margaret and her 3 friends arrive the boy decides to play \\"Spin the bottle\\". When the boys get tired of that game they decide to play \\"2 Minutes in the Closet\\". Margaret doesn't feal ready to kiss any one, but what is she supposed to do?<br />This book is very funny, but I wouldn't recomend it to anyone younger than 10. It deals with a lot of growing up, and puberty. It could scare anyone younger than 10, and make them afrade of growing up. My mom and I have talked about this kind of thing, and this book just helped me to be even more prepared. I think any girl who is nervouse becuase they're still \\"flat\\" or they are afraid of not growing up quickly enough, should read this book, that way they can comfort their fears and be reassured that their body has this under control!	2003-02-10

Forster didn't like people? <br />That's certainly the feeling I got while reading this book. It's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just that, well...you kind of get the feeling that Forster doesn't really care about his characters. Instead of pulling you in and making the characters come alive so that they are real to you, and familiar, and friendly, Forster tells his story as if he were a zookeeper describing to you the behavior of the bonobos. There is an unbreachable glass wall between the reader and the characters that makes it hard to connect with or relate to the story. To make matters worse, Zookeeper Forster only seems to describe the bad behavior of the bonobos. He dwells continuously on the bad traits of his characters. He seems to think nothing of ruthlessly pointing out their faults and foibles, and dwelling on them incessantly. He completely humiliates the characters in the eyes of the readers, thus making even the \\"nice\\" characters, such as Dr. Aziz and Mrs. Moore hard to like. The moment you do begin to like any of the characters, Forster immediately returns to his critical mode, and once again exposes and harps on the faults of the characters, driving you quickly back to your former \\"who cares what happens to Adela Quested?\\" feelings. All this combines to result in a cooling of the reader's interest...at least it did in my case. While the story is interesting, and not completely dull, it is hard to get really caught up in a story where you don't care about any of the characters. While I have read worse books, I have also read books that are much better, with more likeable and realistic characters, and more gripping plots. However, this book is a classic, and provides an excellent and compelling look at race relations in 1920s India, and so I would reccommend it for those reasons. But, on the other hand, you can get a better written and more enjoyable read with essentially the same plot by reading \\"To KillA Mockingbird.\\" You'll like the characters better too.	2002-09-27

My teacher had greatly enjoyed this series, and had infused me with her own enthusiasm, so I picked up this book with high expectations. Boy, was I disappointed. In addition to being very poorly written, and employing terrible grammar, this book was incredibly boring and slow-paced. I don't usually mind a quiet, or slow-developing story, if it is well-written and interesting, but this was neither- it was simply a sleeper. It wasn't that I didn't try- I really did attempt to like the book, and to interest myself in it. However, my efforts were in vain, and as I read I often found myself falling into a stupefied trance, where I would read five to ten pages, and not take in a word. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get this book to interest me. It wasn't only the plot and the bad writing that disappointed me- the characters weren't much either. Bland, boring, monotonous and one-dimensional, it was incredibly hard to distinguish one from the other. The one exception was Will, the main character, who could only be distinguished by his incredibly self-centered attitude, his extreme selfishness, his disgusting self-pity, and his revolting egotism. I wouldn't have minded these traits so much if by the end of the book he had undergone some character development, and perhaps confronted his faults and become a better person. However, this did not happen, and he remained the same unlikeable person from beginning to end. Overall, I would not reccommend this book to any but those who are suffering from extreme insomnia- and even then, a big mug of chamomile tea is better than this book.	2002-07-22

Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great.	2002-07-21

Robert Louis Stevenson was without a doubt one of the greatest historical/adventure novelists that ever lived, and Kidnapped is unquestionably one of his best works. My only regret is that I waited so long to finally read it. It was a new and exciting change from Treasure Island, a book which I love, but have read approximately once every year since the second grade. Finally, longing for a little swashbuckle, and wishing for a way out of my Jim Hawkins rut, I picked up Kidnapped, and was immediately swept off on a thrilling, suspenseful and exhilarating adventure through the Scottish highlands. For days I sat rigid on the edge of my seat, eagerly following the young David Balfour as he was cheated of his inheritance by his wily uncle, kidnapped by pirates, and befriended by a cocky Jacobite outlaw. Breathlessly, I followed him and his companion as they were falsely accused of murder and forced to flee from British troops. Finally, I heaved a sigh of contented disappointment as the story ended, glad at the way things had ended, yet upset that it all had to end and that I would at last have to part from the two heroes of whom I had grown so fond. This is without a doubt a book that I will reread as many times as I have Treasure Island, and I envy the lucky reader who is picking it up for the first time. It is thrilling, exciting, suspenseful, unpredictable, and thoroughly intoxicating. After reading it, my thirst for such dashing adventure was so terrible that I immediately had to run to the library and lay my hands on every adventure novel I could find. I would highly reccommend it to every lover of adventure stories, particularly those with a historical base. I would suggest though that first time readers take a minute to read just a very little bit about the Jacobite rebellions, particularly the one of 1745. It will help greatly to clarify the story, and make it that much more enjoyable. (If indeed, it could get any better than it already is!)	2002-07-21

Thank goodness! Finally I am clear on just what this &quot;whist&quot; game is that everybody in every nineteenth century British novel is always playing! I also understand the gout that troubled all the fashionable baronets, why Lydia Bennet and George Wickham were at first believed to have gone to Gretna Green, why the eldest daughter is never introduced by her first name, and the Chancery Court that plagued &quot;Bleak House.&quot; I have learned the rules of good behavior for ladies, how to pay calls, address my betters, be presented at court, and dozens of other rules, facts and tidbits that have added a new level of depth and enjoyment to my favorite novels. This book is full of fascinating information and no fan of nineteenth century British literature should be without it. Since receiving it for Christmas, I have not read a single novel by Dickens, Austen or the Bronte sisters without having this handy guide within arm's reach. Much of the confusion is gone from &quot;Bleak House,&quot; &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; I enjoy these wonderful novels that much more for this absorbing book, which is so interesting that sometimes, after referencing a particular something, I find it difficult to put down this guide and return to my Dickens. Definitely a must for those who, like me, enjoyed reading &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; but occasionally found themselves baffled by the complex rules of nineteenth century English society.	2002-07-21

I've never read any of Marion Zimmer Bradley's other works- and after trying Firebrand, I don't think I'm likely too. The book was quite a disappointment. It could have been a very interesting story-in fact, parts of it were extremely interesting-but Ms. Bradley let it fall very, very short. I am a girl, and even I thought the plot was a little too feministic. By pulling feminism into a Greek epic, Ms. Bradley gave the story a twentieth century attitude that was all wrong for the story. <br />However, it was not the feminism that made me put down the book before I finished it- it was the constance reappearance of age inappropriate material that finally disgusted me. To concerned parents- either read this book before your child, or with your child! Almost every page is full of inappropriate, very suggestive dialogue, and/or immoral, and inappropriate behavior. It is not as bad as the material contained in some books, but it was more graphically described then I felt comfortable with. I tend to be a very modest person, and extremely sensitive to that kind of thing, so I may be overreacting a bit, but I believe I felt a blush just about every time I turned a page. Finally, unable to stand the improper material, I dropped the book, and went to read some old fairy tales, in order to clear my mind.  I suppose I should have heeded the warnings that flashed at me the instant I began reading the book, and read the story about Leda and Zeus. Being a die-hard fan of Greek mythology, especially of the Trojan War, I immediately noticed the big innaccuracy at the beginning. Zeus did not come to Leda in the form of her husband, he visited her in the form of a swan, after which she laid to eggs, one fathered by her husband, the other by Zeus. I suppose this is a small blip, but take it as a warning of the book to come. Overall, I was exceedingly disappointed in the story. Kassandra is probably one the most captivating characters in the drama of  the Trojan War- I know I have alwaysbeen interested in her. So when I picked up this book, I expected a interesting story, a new twist, a fresh, original look. What I got, was a real time waster.	2001-04-21

Here is a wonderful, heartbreaking story, a story to make you laugh and cry, a jewel of a story to treasure forever, to read again and again. I would recommend this book, this entire series to anyone who wishes for a beautiful, true story. For while the story of Merlin's youth is a fairy tale, in it's fantasy it is truer than the facts in any book- to the spirit at least. I would encourage children to loan it to their parents, and parents to read it with their children. Reading this book is a truly marvelous experience.	2000-11-04

From the very beginning, the story sweeps you up and holds you captive. On the first page, Jane is sure to win you over, and keep you on her side throughout the  entire book. Told in elegant English, the story feels real and the  characters seem to leap out of the pages. When I read Jane Eyre, I felt the  lonely misery of her childhood, endured the sufferings of Lowood School,  and shivered in the dark as strange noises issued from the attic of Mr.  Rochester's house. I too rejoiced at the prospect of marriage to Mr.  Rochester, and was filled with dark despair when the secret of the locked  third story room was revealed. This book is truly a masterpiece that I  would encourage everyone, even teenagers and young adults to read. You  won't regret it if you do.	2000-07-12

The story of the old man, the little girl,  the true prince and the beautiful Odette is told with simple elegance  through the eyes of the wise old grandfather. I read this book out loud  with my friend, and we could have stayed up all night, caught up in the  beautiful, heartbreaking tale of love and life and learning. We laughed and  cried, and sat stiff with suspense. We were filled by turns with sorrow and  joy, despair and hope and sometimes a mixture of them all. Everyone should  read Swan Lake, for this book is truly a treasure, a gem that will shine  brightly for years to come.	2000-07-08
