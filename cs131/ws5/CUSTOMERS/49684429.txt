US	49684429	R2W8JFDJF7X201	0375704531	809033531	The Girl at the Lion d'Or	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Beautifully written and thought provoking.	This story opens with a prologue about three newspaper stories. Two of the stories deal with the demise of two political figures. The third story, very brief, almost lost on the page, deals with an unknown female intruder in the grounds of the prime minister's residence. The newspaper makes the French of the day believe the girl is unimportant, but if Faulks' readers are alert, they will see him peel back the layers to show us how important her insignificance is to France. We are introduced to Anne Louvet, a twenty-something girl with a secrect. She has answered an ad to be a waitress at the Hotel du Lion d'or, and when she meets the various  characters of the novel, we are equisitely and subtlely introduced to the themes that caused the fall of France.  Each character represents something that is amiss in pre-World War II France. In Anne, we come to know the beauty and vulnerability of France; In Hartmann, her married lover, Jewish and wealthy, we see the noblese who makes excuses for deflowering her. In the beginning, he convinces himself that he provides for her because he feels sorry for her, but that is the only way he, as a member of the gentry, can justify to himself that his actions are of a higher calling rather than that of a typical, wayward husband. But Hartmann is not alone. Each of the members of the upper classes, in this novel, are ruthless, wolves-in-sheep's clothing, who can manipulate the weak and convince themselves that they were the victim. At work here, also, is the precursor to the Jewish Final Solution in France. Pay close attention to the characters who interact with Hartmann. The other characters of this novel represent various classes and ways of looking at the world. See if you can identify their role in the shaping of France prior to World War II. Read this novel for it's beautiful, lyrical style, but don't cheat yourself by thinking that is all it is. Faulks is a master of the written word who understands the class system in Europe; itis a subtle yet powerful character in and of itself.	2001-07-10

I should have read this book first, but I stumbled onto Mr. Heck's Burden of Hitler's Legacy in my local library. Mr. Heck was 17 years of age when his country was defeated on March 10, 1945. It took him more 30 years to begin to come to terms with what Hitler did to Germany, Europe, and the millions of people who lost their lives, which includes the 6 million Jews, yes, but also the millions and millions of men, women, AND children who died because of Hitler's determination to be all powerful in the world. There were also those millions who lived on, after the war, who would have to adjust to the results of Hitler's need for power.<br />Mr. Heck shows us that Hitler prepared the children of his &quot;beloved&quot; Germany to fight for his vile beliefs and thought nothing of the impact his hatred had on these kids. One of the saddest things that I thought about as I read this gifted writer's treatise about the Hitler Youth movement was the  waste of this man's talent. He should have been writing all his life. He should have had the FREEDOM to develop the talents he was born with. Read this book and weep, as I did, when I read Mr. Heck's final paragraph in this powerful, true story of the Hitler Youth. For me, what Hitler did to the children of his country, there are no words to describe what I felt. Just writing this review makes me cry.<br />Mr. Heck, if you are still with us, I hope you will continue to write and publish. And I hope you have peace at last.	2001-06-29

Mary Lennox is a pitiful, spoiled little girl whose parents die in an earthquake, and she is sent to her maternal uncle- by marriage to live on his melancholy estate in England. Anger drives Mary, not just because she has lost her parents and her the life she knows, but also because her parents paid no attention to the little girl who was being raised by servants.  When Mary arrives at her uncle's home, she finds more of the same, except that the servants expect her to be more independent. Spoiled, Mary is angry by the loss of control of her world. One day, while exploring the vast grounds of the estate, Mary discovers there is a secret garden with no known key to the door. Mary becomes determined to find a way inside the garden, and when she does she transforms herself and all around her. A lovely story for children and adults.	2001-06-19

However, it still lingers with me after completing it a week ago, so I gave it 5 stars.  Dinah, Jacob's daughter is a fleeting name in the book of Genesis in The Bible. Like most women mentioned in the B, she matters only as a brief catalyst, someone who has been &quot;defiled,&quot; an interesting word since even the Bible indicates she adored her princely lover.  Anita Diamant blow's life into Dinah just as Eve was created from Adam's rib; but with a woman doing the creating, we get a full blown character with real life images. Diamant's Biblical women really breathe, think,  talk, and do interesting things  in this beautifully imagined  sojourn into the desert with Rachel, Leah, Dinah and other women who silently populate the Bible, a man's book, if there ever was one. I would be delighted, if Anita Diamant took every book of the Bible, starting with Eve, and gave life, from a  woman's point of view, to all of the women.	2001-06-08

Bridget Jones Diary was written during that phase when Jane Austen was being revived and emulated with regularity. Modern day Bridget is desperate to be a member of the smug marrieds, but she still retains her singleton status. Embarking on a self- improvement plan, she charts her progress with weightloss, reduction in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and success with the opposite sex. At the end of a year, she notes the results that have come to pass. Meanwhile, she meets Mr. Darcy,<br />Gets involved with her boss, witnesses the upheavel of her parents' relationship, and whines about the condition of life for a young thirty-something who has been eluded by romance.<br />At times I enjoyed this little diary approach to life for singles, but it grow tiresome at times. I kept thinking how sad for these young women to be putting their lives on hold when they could be having such a lovely time with life. They were employed, had a safe environment, and friends. Too bad they didn't learn that the best way to meet someone is to do the things that make you happy. Then you'll meet someone with whom you can relate to.	2001-05-23

Since he isn't yet 18, he is spared  death. But he will go on the rest of his life in bewilderment about what happened to him and the many young Hitler Youth. His book, The Burden of Hitler's Legacy, is his soul searching<br />autobiography that provides more understanding of what happened in Hitler's Germany than anything else I've seen. In addition, it is an eye-opener that demonstrates how vulnerable children are. I have read many books and articles about the holocaust and continue to be shaken by all accounts. This book makes more complete the story of what happened to the children of WWII. While I cannot condone what Mr. Heck did in his youth, as a teacher, mother, and former child, I can certainly understand how it happened. I applaud your courage, Mr. Heck, and the concern you feel for the other children in the Hitler Youth.	2001-05-21

Like many females, I enjoy learning about female historical figures. I want to know as much truth as I can find. The author does exactly that for the reader. This book is a detailed account of the events that triggered Joan d'Arc's dedication to her country and its rightful king. The author traces the history based on documents and other works that have been carefully researched. She provides the reader with the personality traits and beliefs of the time which drove the events that led to Joan's trial and death. Accusations of witchcraft and sorcery were used by church and secular leaders to destroy the young life of a heroic woman because of jealousy, superstition, and shady business  surrounding the church and state. In addition, health and medical issues of the times are revealed that are shocking and entertaining. Read this book to learn about Joan, but also about the way people  lived.

Suddenly, her father disappears and almost as quickly, their mother spirits Anna and older brother, Max, out of Germany to join their father in safety in Switzerland. But now, there is hardly any money, the children and their parents live in a tiny village inn room and must adjust to a new community with unusual customs.

But, as long as their together, Anna doesn't care if they are refugees. How long can they survive moving from place to place, and how long before Hitler moves across Europe?

The Bone People is a book that you eithe love or hate. It is simply a matter of preference for writing style and treatment of subject matter. I personally prefer works that have more structure and direction. Keri Hulmes stream of conciousness &quot;style&quot; seems self-absorbed and limited. It is verbose to the extreme and contains endless lists of words and run on  sentences that appear to be an attempt to hide the fact that very little character development evolves and plot is left out. If this is mysticism, spare me. If this is storytelling, who were the characters and what is the plot? The characters are only shadows that never get fleshed out. The author continuously &quot;drops&quot; hints that never get past first base. I wanted a home run, but the author kept stealing the bases out from under her own feet. Who were these people? In the end, I was glad to see them go because the author did nothing to make me care about them. Dangling bits of information is unfair to the reader and poor writing technique. Finally, the treatment of the themes were selfish and unrealistic. There is no way that &quot;Joe&quot; would be allowed to maintain any connection with Simon after his horrible deeds were discovered by athorities, and I resent the author's attempt to make the reader view Joe as a hero. He is evil. No evil person should be glorified in a novel. Not a person who is a child abuser,  no matter how pitiful the abuser's background. The K.H. character obviously demonstrates that this book is,  at best, fictionalized journal writing that somehow got  published after being thwarted by the mainstream publishers. Sometimes that is good. However, this book needed much more work and the brutal hand of a responsible editor.	2000-12-04

I do not wish to hurt anyone who has suffered from the holocaust by  writing this review, nor do I want  dishonor anyone who was destroyed by  it. I am only making an observation about what happened to this woman named  Stella. Stella was a beautiful blonde girl who reached early maturity  during WWII in Berlin. She was Jewish, but with her blue eyes she could  easily pass for a gentile. When Hitler started his personal war against  Jews, he initiated the most horrible and beastly experience that could  happen to human beings. With his henchmen, and their vicious attacks on  Jews and other peoples, he pushed people into  emotional dungeons, and it  is at these dark, these lowest levels, that we discover what we are really  capable of doing. In his painful memoir of his experiences of the  holocaust, Elie Weisel, shows us in Night, that when the  Nazis tossed tiny  bits of bread to starving Jews, many of them killed for that one morsel of  food, sometimes ending the lives of their loved ones for a chance to put  something in their mouths. For me, this book was about survival. No one  knows what they are capable of unless they are taken to that horrifying  nightmare place of doom, and unless one has been there, there is absolutely  no way of knowing what our choices would be. Many would argue that Stella  did not get to the extremes that occurred in the death camps. But we do  know that she was beaten over and over and over again. And then she was  offered a chance to have it all end by being a &quot;catcher&quot; for the  Nazis. We know that other Jews committed suicide to avoid the beatings and  the offer of becoming a catcher to stay alive. I can only thank God that I  have never had to be in such a situation, because I don't know what I would  do. How could I know? I do know that I have a very strong instinct to live,  and I think that may have been why Stella took the path  that she did. I  believe, that in making that choice, she did lose her &quot;soul.&quot; Ithink that is the only way that a human being could do what she did. For  Stella did not only &quot;catch&quot; Jews for the Nazis, many eyewitnesses  said she seemed to enjoy it. I think for anyone to make that  &quot;choice&quot; you would have to put your entire being into it  in  order to perform those horrible crimes. In the end, I think Stella suffered  far more than if she had allowed herself to die at the hands of the Nazis.  At the age of about 21, she began the life of a person who is hated by  virtually everyone she had ever known and anyone she would ever meet. She  lives her life constantly attempting to convince herself that she didn't do  anything wrong. She lives in total seclusion, with the lights always dim,   year after year with no one to love her, no one to hold her, no one to  console her. And still she survived into old age. Survival was Stella's  strongest urge. It kept her alive to live a lifelong death,  the death of  her humanity, with the destruction of hundreds, perhaps thousands on her  hands. Would I choose survival? In retrospect, had I been a  &quot;Stella,&quot; I can only pray that I would have had the ability to  accept my death at the hands of the Nazis.	2000-09-07

With the men away at war, and England cut off from supplies  from other countries, women were the only &quot;chance&quot; for England  itself to survive. They were essential in the factories and on the farms.  They kept the country going, and in doing so, forged a new way of life for  women. Women realized they were capable human beings. They basked in their  new found abilities and the knowledge that England  needed them for the  same reasons she had needed its men. The war changed the world in many  ways, perhaps most crutially by what it did for women. Whether these  changes were for the good of all people is open to interpretation. But  there is nothing like learning you are a strong and capable person, and for  me, that is what was best portrayed in this story.  I did not care for the  ending, though. I felt it didn't make sense in relation to the  rest of the  story.  It seemed contrived and forced, and that is why I could not give it  more stars.	2000-09-06

The Bob books are the most appealing early reading books for kids currently on the market today.  As a first grade teacher,  and mother of a  grown child, I have used these books for 15 years. They are perfect for  young readers. The children love them. Their small size, gentle story  lines, simple line drawings are all drawing cards for young readers.  Children are small, and they love little things. They are not little  adults; they need stories that are amusing, gentle, and age appropriate.  Great  literature is for later! At the early stages, the reading should be  accessible to developing skills. That is why I always have the Bob books  available for my kids. I want them to love reading.

I teach first grade and also have a grown son; I use (d) the Bob books with all of my children. Many educators advocate big books in our current  educational trends, but if you really want to guarantee a child's  attention, use little books. Most children absolutely adore them!  The Bob  books are special because they really are written on a young child's level.  I always have the &quot;literary&quot; quality  books that are recommended  for today's classroom, but my kids always want the Bob books  or the little  books I make for them. They also prefer the simple words, illustrations  (Bob's are simple line drawings), and themes. Why? Because they are  definitely written for children rather than adults who think that you are  not providing a good education for children unless they have high quality  literature in their hands.  But, I ask you, parents and teachers, how  valuable is it to have a cat named Aristotle or Aristophenes(sp?..who  cares! at this age!) when you can name the characters Sam, or Matt, or  Spot. The point is, reading should be easy to learn, not mind boggling.   Get these Bob books! Get them all! And make up your own, as well. Then you  will have your kids reading.....and just as  important..........loving  it!  What age do  you begin? Before they are born, in my opinion, as long  as you are not &quot;forcing&quot; it on them. If you read to them as early  as their entry into the world, and show that you enjoy it, reading will be  as second nature to your children as anything else that you value.	2000-09-04

Provence is heaven to me.I love the hills, the variety of plant life, and  the exquisite villages with their definitive shuttters and dove cotes. The  fountains bubble with life. The cobbled streets lead to some of the most  fetching homes and buildings in the world. The Provencal people dress their  windows in lace and paint the exterior and interior of their homes in the  colors found in the Provencal landscape: blue, yellow, ochre, greens.  Terracotta roofs provide the most wonderful color and texture to the  landscape. Somehow everything blends wonderfully! The creators of The Most  Beautiful Villages in Provence  capture the essence of this southern region  of France.  The photography vividly presents the viewer with a panorama of   gorgeous scenes: fields of lavender, geraniums in pots leading to a  beautiful door, roof top views that  are breathtaking, undulating paths  that take you to splendid spots, aerial views of villages, an old roman  road and bridge.  A friend of mine, who was born in Provence, gave me this  incredibly beautiful book; the only thing better, she says, is to be there!  I plan to take this book with me to Provence next summer!!

At Home in Mitford is a gentle escape from the stress of  modern life. Set  in the mountains of North Carolina, Mitford is a town, seemingly lost in  another age, asleep while the rest of the world marches on. I read this  book at bedtime and it was a wonderful way to fall asleep. Father Tim is an  Episcapol priest, who at 60, has never been married. His life is  predicatable, a little boring, but  fairly enjoyable. He is loved by his  parish because of  his folksy approach to fulfilling his role as their  priest. He is a familiar, gentle old shoe to the entire community, and he  radiates with pleasure from the town's eccentric and  predictable daily  life. This is a town buzzing with quaint goings-on that bring fuzzy warmth  to an open reader. I read some of the complaints about this book, such as  there is no plot and the characters aren't developed. It's true, the plot  is simplistic and most of the characters the reader only meets on the  surface. But we only need to glimpse these characters as Father Tim does.  They are interesting and  amusing, but they don't all offer the challenges  and  interruptions of Father Tim's life, and they don't need to do so.  There is Barnabas, the dog, Dooley, the neglected and &quot;lost&quot; kid  from the poor, unapproachable ghetto-village up the mountain, and Cynthia,  the novelist-new neighbor to fulfill the story's need for character  development. And of course, there is Father Tim. This story is not one to  receive literary prizes, but it does deliver, in a big way, to the need for  a place where everyone helps one another, where the worst thing that  happens doesn't spill blood, and life is predictable and reassuring and  treasured and it's safe to go jogging at night.	2000-08-23

I read in an interview with Jan Karon that she got her inspiration for At Home in Mitford from the Miss Read Series. And it is  clear that she did.  Miss Read is the head teacher at a village shool in England. She has the  older boys and girls, while Miss Claire has the &quot;babies, &quot;  kindergartners and first graders in American terms.  This story was written  in the 1950's and reflects the times perfectly. All was not perfect in that  era, but it was less complicated. Discipline only needed a cuff on the  fanny ( a little shocking...especially how it came about!), and academic  skills are regimented with drills. But most of the children thrived and  many flourished under the watchful eye of Miss Read. Miss Read is the  precursor for Father Tim in Jan Karon's series;that is as clear as they  come!  The one room school house is divided by a partition, and lunches are  eaten from pails and drinks provided by the teachers: hot chocolate from  the central wood stove that heats the school.  The school is host to Mrs.  Pringle, a crochety old lady who cleans the school and takes  &quot;stabs&quot; at Miss Read's run of the school.  We get to visit Miss  read's cozy cottage from time to time and view other village homes as well.  I enjoyed these excursions into the domestic life of villagers from a not  too distant time gone but not lost.....it lives on between the covers of  all of Miss Read's volumes of country life in a village one comes to  cherish.	2000-08-23

Stone Soup is a classic story brought to life through the pictures by Winslow Pinney Pels.  A young man, a pauper,  spies a house that looks like  plenty of food could be found  there. The old woman who owns the house  tells him to go away, she has no food in the house, no food in the garden.  The young man asks her for a stone. &quot;A stone, what do you want with a   stone,&quot; she curiously asks the pauper. &quot;Ah,&quot; says he, and he  knows he HAS her. As the story unfolds, the young man has the woman adding  more and more ingredients to the stone soup the young man is making.  Completely duped, until possibly the very end, the old woman is the young  man's accomplice in tricking herself into providing the pauper with a  &quot;feast for a king.&quot;  And what will become of the stone, read the  story, and find out!

This atlas answers all  those questions for kids. The animals are presented in their ecosystems. A  photograph represents the animal in their natural environment and discusses  how each species lives and interacts in their environment.

I have enjoyed tofu for about ten years. There are a number of cookbooks at my favorite health food store. This one is fabulous! Tofu has a lot to offer. As a soy product it offers  protein with out the salt, fat,  cholesterol, and additives that are now inherrent in some many other  protein foods.  Tofu also is considered a good choice for women, especially  those over 40 years of age. By combining tofu and yams, some people  believe, women can avoid some of the problems that accompany menopause.  Therefore, it is a good idea for even young women to develop the habit of  including these food items in their daily  diet. Japanese women, who do not  typically take estrogen, do not experience the same problems that western  women have with menopause. These recipes are so wonderful that even those  who turn their noses up at tofu would be pleasantly surprised. I have  served a number of these recipes to family and friends and they had no idea  they were eating tofu until I told them! And my son has always thought it  was disgusting!  Bon appetite'!	2000-07-24

Naipaul took a short turn in the south and then wrote a piece of non-fiction that many readers believed to be a written portrait of the American south. However, I must  express my doubts of the accuracy of this  treatise. When I first read this book, shortly after it was published in  1989, I was impressed by his writing as an art. However, I had already  spent nine years in South Carolina after moving south from Oregon; I was  amazed that someone with his education and knowledge of people,  traveled  through the south in a period of a few months at most, then wrote a book  which he believes to be an accurate and defining piece of non-fiction. I am  a very observant and intelligent person, and after having resided in South  Carolina for 20 years, I am just now really understanding the place  where  I have spent my entire adult life. Most of my friends are  southerners, I  have taught southern children for 15 years, and my own child was born here.  You cannot go into any area of the world and understand it without becoming  a part of it. People, and the south is famous for this, do not reveal who  they are or what they believe, even to neutral strangers, until they think  you are &quot;one of them.&quot;  I have always been enamoured of  India,  but I don't believe Mr. Naipaul would credit me with a  book about India  unless I really knew it. That takes a long time. I enjoy this author's  novels immensely, and this book, for me, is also a work of fiction.	2000-07-21

The unidentified woman, and  the man she refers to as A, only meet for the intermittent adult romp that,  in my view of her revelation, only brings her pain. Her entire existence  for a two-year period is motivated by the time she is able to be with him (  which is rare ) and the opportunity she has to fantasize about him. The  writer culminates the story by saying that she feels luxury is &quot;being  able to live out a passion for a man or a woman. In this case, however, as  it seems in any obsessive relationship, there is only an abundance of pain  and precious, lost time. Some people are real victims of the world  and  their suffering is not chosen. The pain in this book is particularly  melancholy because it didn't have to be. I give this book 5 stars because  it is a beautifully written account of something I never want to  experience. We only have so much time on this earth, and suffering with  obsession is not the kind of passion I would ever want to know. I  understand it, I feel sympathy, I just don't want it.	2000-07-20

This lovely book is quintessential French country. The authors take the reader on a tour of vistas from the Mediterranean Sea to Provence; country homes range from the rugged to the elegant. The text reveals to the reader  the common elements to be found in the variety of homes found in the French  countryside. Vibrant colors  follow paticular painterly selection if one  wants to create the true feel of a French country home. Shutters are  French, not American. Lace is typically at the windows, or for a more grand  effect billowing panels with French pleats, caught and pulled to the side  about 3/4's from the top of the drop. Window boxes brimming with color are  essential for this style, and borders of lavender would make you feel that  you are really there. Terracotta roof tiles would complete the exterior  view. Inside, the walls vary, but they definitely make the statement: I am  France. Terracotta tile floors are very common, but hardwood floors are  fine, too. Mouldings are landmarks, and  they are abundantly visualized in  this volume. Provencal prints, bergere chairs, ladder back dinning and/or  kitchen chairs, flowers---all are shown in French homes. In the kitchen,  pots on display, wall tiles, a baker's rack, a country table, open shelves,  walls that are rubbed with earthy hues make the room inviting and warm---a  gathering place. Dining is wonderful, inside or out. The French love to eat  outside. The bedroom is simple or elegant, but deliberately French. Lace,  panels, sometimes two layers, billowing to the floor, European pillows, and  definitely a bolster and duvet enrich the feeling of a retreat. At least a  touch of toile should be seen. I remember a French friend telling me once,  that one of the most important things a true French person does when  considering something for their home. She said the French don't decorate  like Americans do, try to figure out if an object will work; for the  French, if they like something, they find a place for it.They learn very  early how to put things together. And you can always see it no matter how  much they have to spend. It's just perfect. This beautiful volume is filled  with beautiful pictures to create your own French Country style.	2000-07-18

James Fox takes the reader into the world of 1941's Happy Valley crowd of Nairobi, Kenya to explore the murder of of Jossyln Hay, Earl of Erroll. The Earl, better known as Joss, was a member of the upper-class enclave of  English colonials living in Kenya at the time of WWII. A lady's man, Joss  Hay, like many of the Happy Valley set, ignored the &quot;rules&quot; of  society, and indulged himself  with who ever caught his eye, married or  not. He was found, on the morning of January 24, shot through the head, in  a car near Happy Valley. This account of a true story, resurfaces all the  decadence and indulgence that  is a major force of history of Nairobi's  colonial society.  A suspect was brought to trial, but the case was never  resolved. Mr. Fox, years later, examines the evidence of the trial,  interviews survivors, and escorts the reader through the process of  investigation to discover who really pulled the trigger and why.

Pippi looks at things as obliquely as her braids; she usually sees  the positive side of things, unless she is requested to go to school or  learn the multiplication tables. She has her own ideas about things, and  simply cannot be made to follow the rules, but her way of disobeying is  amusing and quite chathartic for children who ALWAYS have to follow the  rules that adults make. She does not inspire kids to break the rules;she  just makes them laugh with glee at her absurdity. She has *powers*  that  they adore!	2000-07-05

I've tried to think about how I wanted to review this account of a fifteen year old boy's  suffering in several concentration camps during the last six  months of WWII. I was shocked as I have always been since I first  learned about the holocaust when I was about ten years of age. No matter  how many articles, books, or movies that have revealed this experience, I  find it impossible to comprehend the behavior of the the German Gestapo,  SS, and so many soldiers, doctors, and others. In this volume, Mr. Weisel  tells the reader that after months and months of near starvation, some of  the guards throw pieces of bread into one of the &quot;cattle&quot; cars  that holds people that are dying from the cold, starvation, dysentary, etc.  The guards were entertained, and laughed as if watching a slap stick  comedy, while  these tortured people were fighting each other, some to the  death, for a piece of bread to chew. Some of the previous reviewers  commented that they could not fight  other prisoners for food,  let alone a  &quot;loved&quot; one. I am grateful  I've never had to find out what I  would be like if I had been so brutually exploited. I hope that I could  &quot;rise&quot; above it, but there is no way I could ever begin to know  without the experience.  It isn't  something I want to think about. But I  can think about the importance of the people who survived and the  importance of  their writings, the survivors who have chosen to do so. I  have read some reviews of this book which &quot;compare&quot; this account  with others. &quot;This one&quot; was better because of... That one was  more....&quot; I don't know how a reader can compare one person's suffering  in a concentration camp with another. My belief is it is another story that  needs to be shared. They all suffered; they were all brutalized. I  personally don't think one is better than the other. Just true. This  account is extremely vivid. As a mother, I am most grateful that I have  never had to experience such horrors with my child. But brutality is  happening to mothers' children  everyday, right now, as I write.experience such horrors with my child.

Outwitting the Gestapo is the real life experience of one woman's determination, at all costs, to save her husband, her true other half, from execution by the infamous Klaus Barbie, &quot;Butcher of Lyon.&quot; That  is what makes it so compelling. I was drawn to this memoir, written in  diary form, from May 14, 1943 through February 12, 1944, because I had seen  the French film, * Lucie Aubrac *. A gorgeous film, that follows the same  experience as this book, I was left wanting more. I was richly rewarded by  reading this intimate  revelation of the French Resistance and the couple  who are equally committed to each other and the freedom of France. This  story is a vivid portrait of devotion and fortitude. Raymond, Lucie  Aubrac's husband, and the  father of her young son and the child she  carries in her womb, is arrested and sentenced to die. Lucie has been  involved with the resistance since its beginning, but with the advent of  this new ordeal, she masterminds a terrifying attempt to free her beloved  husband. With her &quot;buddies&quot; in the resistance, a plan is  orchestrated that involves the increasingly expanding Lucie to have almost  daily contact with Klaus Barbie. Singlehandedly, she  attempts to convince  this monster to allow a  contact with Raymond, making Barbie believe that  she is an unwed mother who must marry Raymond to give her child a name.  Constantly changing names and domains, Lucie and the other members of the  resistance live with the constant fear of being caught, yet nothing  inteferes with their goals. Their unflinching  resolve is what makes for  true heroism; their  dedication to each other redefines friendship for me.  The film is indeed beautiful, but it is in many ways short-sighted. There  is so much more to this story than is presented on celluloid.  Lucie Aubrac  tells her remarkable story while enveloping her comrades into her heart,  and presents the reader with the depth of her love for Raymond and France.  This book gives a more complete picture of France and the  Resistance, and  of course, the love that many people would want to die for.

This  lovely, thought-provoking volume hallmarks the friendships that women  experience. It enhances one of the values of being a woman beautifully: the  closeness we feel to our women friends. Is there anything else like it?  Being silly, listening, encouraging, empathazing, sharing thoughts that  would abhor men. It makes you really glad to know that so many of us just   love being inside the skin of a woman! This little gem shares quotes from  unidentified women about their friends. Here is a sampling: &quot;The more  we let our girlfriends know how much they are valued, the stronger our  friendships grow.&quot; &quot;The bond that we forged so many years ago is  now unbreakable.&quot; &quot;Every healthy, loving relationship between two   people requires that both individuals be able to tolerate the differences  between them.&quot; &quot;A true friendship is in trouble when you pick and  choose what you reveal.&quot; &quot;All we may need is a friend to share  her strength , and we can become clear-headed again.&quot; &quot;We share  our vulnerabilities with each other and come away stronger.&quot;  &quot;Regardless of culture or time or distance, women bond together  through laughter, dares, and crazy plans.&quot; There, now that I've saved  some of my  favorite quotes, perhaps I can give this volume up to my  friend, Cheryl.	2000-06-27

This wonderful hiking guide does indeed disclose to the reader some almost unknown trails.  I was born and raised in the Portland area and frequently made stops with family or friends while driving Oregon's highways. There  are numerous unmarked trails heretofore quite unknown to the average  person. This volume gives access to a number of those &quot;hidden&quot;  gems.  My all-time favorite Oregon hike is along the trails above Multnomah  falls. If you run them, with the cool air there, you will experience the  all time natural high! The Columbia Gorge is truly a miracle for the Oregon  hiker. I hope you appreciate what you have there! For the most part, I just  get to fantasize by looking at this volume.

This is the equisitely haunting tale of an  impoverished black woman's search for love, meaning, and freedom in pre-civil rights era Florida.  The story opens with the return of Janie to the mud and shack village that she  left with her first husband. Now, after experiencing Florida as a poverty  stricken, dependent wife, Janie recounts to her village friend Pheoby, all  the extremes of life that she has  journeyed since her departure some years   before.  Told in black dialect, this epic self- discovery and testament to  fortitude, spirit, and human  dignity steals the heart of the reader who is  willing to listen to and experience with Janie all the travails that are  heaped upon her in 1930's Florida. Janie's growth becomes the reader's own  discovery of life for a poor black woman with intelligence, need for love,  and pure determination to survive in the face of enormous obstacles of  human and mother nature.  The characters that populate Janie's sojourn are  powerfully described by the author. There are all of her husbands, her  friends, animals, the Florida terrain and weather, and others.  However,  the most mesmerizing character in this eloquent novel is Zora Neale  Hurston's lyrical and hypnotic use of language. It sets the stage of the  tale at the onset of the story and makes you care deeply about Janie.  Gorgeously constructed, each sentence is a thing of  beauty in and of  itself. The rich, &quot;brown&quot; tones are like an unknown music that  resonates  forever in your soul when you leave this incredible volume. It  has a cadence, a poetry like no other. I gave this book 5 stars because  whenever I see this book on my shelf, it reaches out to me, touches me  again and again, without even turning a page, without even opening the  cover. A lasting achievement, one that truly stands the test of time - a  hallmark of American Literature.	2000-06-24

Children love to make things, and the skills they gain from creating are not only physical, but intellectual and emotional as well. In my first grade classroom, I have used this book  extensively. The projects are  appropriately challenging, which is an essential criteria for happiness as  has been documented in the  nonfictional book, Flow, and other psychology   books.

Beautifully photographed pages  accomodate the crafter so that the finished projects are visualized  throughout the volume. This is a great book to be used at home, school,  church, scouts, and anywhere else  where creativity is fostered  Crafting  and artistic skills contribute to the  feeling of contentment in all  people. Confidence is enhanced by the process of doing and finishing  projects. Instead of watching television, get out a craft book like this  one and make things happen !	2000-06-05

She catches the eye of an Englishman, and their passion for each other is powerful. They need each other for financial reasons as well. She must have a husband to claim her  wealth, while he, as the second son, cannot claim his family fortune at  all. The erotic feelings that the couple expresses for each other is only  fleeting. Antoinette becomes &quot;too much&quot; for the 19th century  English gentleman, who has been raised in a society that with holds  passion.Eventually, quickly, he becomes disgusted with his young wife's  need for exhuberant, physical attention.  Anntoinette becomes desperate to  experience the passion that her young husband had initially,  openly and  happily lavished on her. Once an errupting volcano, their relationship  becomes implosive. The young man, who becomes  intolerant of Anoinette,  desperately  avoids her. She becomes hysterical because as his wife, she  has no control of anything in her life: love, ,sexual attention, money, or  home.  The English husband learns of an opportunity to return to England,  and since Antoinette is his wife, he plans to take her with him. But she  would never fit in the oppressive English landscape, so he has her declared  insane, and takes her home to Thornfield, realizing he will never marry  again as long as she lives.  She is locked in a remote wing of his gothic  mansion on the moors of England, and is lost to the world until she  re-emerges as Bertha Mason in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Beautifully  written, Wide Sargasso Sea, was  Jean Rhys's answer to a question many Jane  Eyre readers have had. Who was the mad  woman? Some of the questions I had  also were answered. Who else would Mr. Rochester want but a young, pure  thing who would adore him and revere him. Jane asked only for his spoken  word never any passion.  Jane was accustomed to dishonest and confusing  relationships while she lived at the  orphanage and her aunt's home as a  child.When she arrived at Thornfield, Mr. Rochester was exactly what she  would fall for: a man who possibly could rescue her, but who also would be  dishonest and confusing. Jane Eyre is great literature as is Wide Sargasso  Sea, but neither story has characters who are capable of good  relationships. The film version is equally well done.	2000-06-05

Owl Moon is a beautifully illustrated tale of a  midnight adventure a little girl has with her father one winter night. The father wakens the child, and together they set out, tromping  through the snow to communicate  with an owl. Jane Yolen and illustrator John  Schoenherr created a story  that almost feels like silence on a brisk snowy night. The reader almost  feels the cold, wintry, dry air. Their feet crunch the vast stretches of  snow, while the father and child walk along, protected by the deep, blue  sky, and the trees and other growth that stand out like characters  themselves.  The simplicity of the story is comforting and soothing. The  love between father and child is not stated, but definitely encompasses the   relationship that is delicately detailed in this exquisite story.	2000-06-05

Narrated by nine-year-old Cassie the story paints the harsh life that blacks endured during the days of depression. Cassie's family, however, is buying a piece of land instead  of sharecropping. The white follks attempt to prevent the family from  making the final payments. However, the family has pluck and common sense,  but above all, committment to each other. Throughout the story hardships  are thrown at this family, yet by never giving up, they endure in their  struggles together. I enjoyed this book and learned from it, however, as a  teacher in the South today, I have seen where books like this one can  actually contribute to the &quot;victim&quot; syndrome in some people.  Also, even though these attitudes were predominant before integration,  there have always been  white people who treated black people with respect  and dignity. I have actually seen children turn on white people because of  another form of prejuidice that continues  to be perpetrated  unjustly. We  can not heal our societal wounds this way.	2000-06-04

The photographer has sumputuously captured the essence of Oregon: her unending supply of known and hidden  bodies of water are a wondrous thing that can be found throughout this  stunning state, vividly presented in this outstanding volume.  The Pacific  Ocean is detailed in all its grandeur of cliffs, jutting rocks, and  chilling waters. The undulating coastal beaches offer thousands of  rich  greens, cool, damp browns, ocean blues and whitecap whites in unending  discoveries that take the travelor's breath away at every bend in the road,  every view to be found.  When a travelor heads inland from the coast, there  is the Oregon coastal range to meander through. Off the beaten path are  &quot;lost&quot; creeks and water falls that tumble along as they have for  thousands of years, all but forgotten unless the travelor stops and walks  through the trees, sometimes only a few feet from the highway. Here one may  find rich mosses embracing the rocks and boulders, pebbles, and fallen  trees that border on a creek hurrying somewhere, laughing with the breezes.  So enchanting, one might expect to see fairies or other mystical creatures  presiding over a lost kingdom. The photography and text invites the reader  to imagine these enticing treasures with deserved pride. The creators of  this book take you to the Cascade Range. Don't be surprised to find  deep  crevices with water trickling from above. If you decide to to traverse such  a crevice be wary of the freezing waters that occupy these fissures. The  rocks and boulders will be slippery with wet algae or the thousands of  years of being splashed on from the falling waters. The coolness will  invigorate you as you find  yourself  succumbing to the pleasure these  photographs provide for you. The photography and beautifully written text  will take you away momentarily, but you won't find any real satisfactionuntil you've experienced the reality which is Oregon. When you view this  book, you'll know you've had an overwhelming experience, and everytime you  open its cover you'll feel Oregon calling, calling. calling..............	2000-05-29

I read Travels with Charley after reading most of Steinbeck's novels.  I  enjoyed it so much that I immediately read it again. This work lets the  reader get a glimpse of John Steinbeck, the  American and the man. I put  American first because Steinbeck, I believe, was one of those men who loved  his country so much, that he seemed to consider himself an American above  all else. I enjoy creative works by individuals who have  an unquestionable  love for something. I believe Steinbeck was such a person.   In the early  '60's he is dismayed (but loves) America, and so sets out to rediscover  her. Since he is a shy person, he takes his dog, a large black poodle named  Charlie, with him to help break the ice with people as he travels  around  the country.

I grew up in Oregon and spent most of my  summers on the Oregon Coast. I live in Sourth Carolina now, and when I look at this book, it makes me cry ---every time.  I am not an experienced travelor, but I know  what beauty  is. The Oregon Coast defines  beauty for me. This book presents pictures  that are breathtakingly beautiful.   I remember as a teenager, walking with  my  girlfriends, lost in the Coastal mist, singing our hearts out. I was  too young to appreciate the glorious visions that are there in my beautiful  Oregon, just so abundantly available. When I go to the Oregon Coast,now, I  just fall apart with emotion. Now more than ever, because my father is  buried there, and he loved it SO much. When you look at the pictures of  this book, remember my father, in his grave site on the cliffs, overlooking  the beautiful sea. What a glorious final resting place.  I dedicate this  review to you, Dad. Thanks for showing me all the beauties of Oregon and  our beautiful Pacific Coast. Barra (Remember our Oregon Coast song? I do!)	2000-05-06

There are some things that do ring true in this book about a first year teacher.  However, for the life of me I cannot determine how she kept  her job.  I cannot imagine EVER talking to  a collegue, let alone a superior,  in the manner that Madame Esme' does in this book. This first year teacher  goes overboard on just about everything she approaches. The first example  is her insistence on being called Madame Esme. How ridiculous!  Her number  one priority should have been to demonstrate respect towards everyone she  works with, and I do not mean cowtowing and being weak. But she is just so  obnoxious. The other important goal she should have is to work at having a  successful class experience for all of her students.   The biggest  complaint that I have about this young woman is that her own ego seems to  be more important than the children she is working with. She talks about an  event she prepared and  complains that her peers did not give her the  recognition she deserves.  Somehow, I don't  think ANY amount of  acknowlegement would have made her happy. Like another reviewer wrote, I  also think she is a bore.I don't think I could tolerate being in the same  school with her for more than 10 minutes.  Marva Collins, she ain't!   (isn't)	2000-05-06

I have always been captivated by novels that take on the expat and women who are gutsy enough to be a head of the times and think  for themselves.  Such is the story of Olivia in Heat and Dust.  But Olivia is not a truely  modern woman, in the sense, that she &quot;fallsl&quot; for an  Indian  nawab, and it is this relationship that leads her down a path that is  shaky, exciting, and, ultimately, still makes her rely  totally on the  opposite sex for her very survival. What is so extraordinary about her, is  that she is willing to give up the safety of everything she has ever known  to become the lover of an  Indian with minor royal ties. Olivia's husband  is warned by the English officers  and their wives that if a young English  woman stays in Delhi during the unbearable hot months instead of going to  the mountains for the cooler air, the uninhibited Indian passions could  have a permanent deletorious affect on her. In other words, the prim and  proper white English must be constantly on guard against the wayward  passions of the &quot;darker&quot; people. Fifty years after Olivia has her  downfall, a distant relative, curious about what has happened to Olivia,  becomes deeply involved in researching Olivia's passionate evolution and  disappearance.  This beautiful story, submerged in periodism and heated  love interests, uncovers the nature of two fascinating women.   Not to be  missed by anyone who is attracted to  the raj of the British East Inda  Company. A warm jewe!	2000-05-05

I enjoyed Ashwell's first decorating book, but this &quot;guide&quot; is among my favorite decorating books. I enjoy the wide range of homes she shows. The only drawback is that a few of the little homes  seemed so nice  and perfectly organized--and then the photographs were limited. If the  pictures for these homes were more extensive, I believe I would have given  this book 5 stars. I love the white, off white, and antique white walls.  The rooms have a very pure look to them because of the wall color and a  limited wall decoration, and yet there are delightful splashes of color in  the prints. Ashwell's restrained, yet lovely approach to  decorating is  welcoming and relaxed. I like it a lot.  I'm even starting to enjoy pink!	2000-05-04

This book is an excellent introduction to the horrors of   WWII without illustrating the shocking accounts too graphically.  As an  adult who has done a lot of reading about this terrible time in history, I  found this book to be exquisite and touching.<br />I believe that it is a  topic that should be  introduced at about age twelve, a very critical time  of life for children.

A  young person reading this book should have someone they can talk to about  these terrible  events.	2000-05-04

I really can identify with her practical yet inviting approach to decorating. She definitely has a definite sense of who she is and what she values in life: comfort,  gentleness, family, friends and simple beauty. All of these traits are   demonstrated in how she writes and decorates. Ms. Ashwell, first of all,  wants her home to be a peaceful retreat without the mysticism of some  current trends.  She finds delight in the elegantly simple and breezy  decor.  One of her beliefs that is particularly enjoyable is her love of  things that have known other people: furniture and fabrics that have a  past. What I like most about her decorating is her use of white. To me  there is nothing more enjoyable than clean white walls, white furniture,  and accessories that create a peaceful harmony for unwinding at the end of  a busy day.   I want her next book to be about the little homes that have  the shabby chic decorating. I want to see Rose and Lou's little house (the  flower  arranger)---every room...from every angle. Three cheers for Ms.  Ashwell!	2000-05-04

However, in a society with  rules that carefully and extensively governs what a girl  can learn, she is  left with very few survival  skills.  Scott O'dell skillfully demonstrates   how Karana carefully thinks through the observations she made of the men in  her village, and then teaches herself through trial and error, to master  these essential survival skills.<br />Scott O'Dell was a master story teller,  and this book is my favorite.

It shows a  loving relationship between a little girl and her mother as well as alleviate the mystery of the tooth fairy.  As a young child (I am a first grade teacher with a grown son), I  saw what I believed to be the tooth fairy. I never forgot it, it made such  an  impression on me. Young children love fantasy  and &quot;little&quot;  things, so for most children, I believe this to be an enchanting departure  from the usual fare of books dealing with the fantasy  world adults create  for children. I was surprised to think that another reviewer  would compare  this topic to poaching of ivory. The child &quot;wants&quot; the tooth  fairy to visit. Many children try to stay awake with the hopes of a magical  glimpse of the tooth fairy. This beautifully illustrated book helps to  &quot;answer&quot; the fantasy questions that children want to  explore.   Even when they no longer truely  believe, many children do not admit it, so  they can continue to enjoy the fantasy world. Imagination and fantasy are  wonderful things that indicate high intelligence. We grow up soon enough  and put these thoughts aside for reality. This book is a beautiful treasure  for children and even adults. I love this book!	2000-05-01

Although I didn't care much for the characters in &quot;Devine Secrets,&quot; I admit to being curious about the prehistory of that book. So I read &quot;Little Altars.&quot; What little interest I had in Vivi, the main  character, plummeted to disgust. I  feel that any human being (particularly one who has hired help,etc.) who  has the desire to have children should do everything in their power to  simply do &quot;right&quot; by them. I would have had ten million times the  respect for Vivi had she taken care of her &quot;needs&quot; down at the  local bar, or worse, as opposed to invading her own children's bodies. It  really concerns me when characters in popular literature, who commit crimes  against  children, are treated as sympathetic and redeemable   personalities. In A Map of the World, the author attempts to create a  forgiving character whose criminal neglect results in the death of a child.  In Little Altars, the mother, Vivi, sexually molests her children. In the  sequel, we &quot;learn&quot; why the mother has violated the most important  trust a human being should honor, and we are asked to forgive it. No! This  supposedly bright woman has no excuse! She should have done everything to  avoid such exploitive behavior. She had three friends who, along with  herself, call themselves the Ya Ya girls. It would have made more sense had  she &quot;called&quot; out to these friends for help. (Of course, then the  author would have had to work at creating an interesting story about  a  less disgusting character.) I once read a book about the middle ages ( a  very bleak period) called A Distant Mirror. The author explains that the  overwhelming reason it was such a terrible period of history was due to the  fact that children were simply  chattel to be used at the owners'  discretion. The result :  children who attained adulthood were brutes,  because that was what they knew. Sometime ago, I met a young mother in the  education section in my library. She asked me if I knew of a good book for  raising children. She told me her own mother was very violent in correcting  her. She did not finish high school, and yet, she felt there had to be a  better way of raising children than what she experienced. When I read this  book, my most basic and internal beliefs as a human being, woman, mother,  and friend were offended. I simply don't understand how a woman could give  birth to a child and then hurt it as dramatically as does Vivi. And I could  never befriend someone whose approach to life is so bizarre.  This book  disgusted me !  I would much rather read a book about that poor mother I  met in the library. What a truly enlightened individual she must be! A  final amazing thought about this book and its sequel is the number of grown  women who love them.  Are any of them mothers?	2000-04-29

I have NEVER met anyone like these characters.  And I don't think I live a sheltered  life.   In addition, I read about &quot;Ya, Ya friendship groups&quot; popping up  all over the country. Many of these people were &quot;discovering&quot;  friendships with women for the first time in their lives. How Sad ! To  think this book about drunks, smoking fiends, and (as seen in Little  Altars)child abusers, directed women to cherish the other women in their  lives; and how bizarre to need a ritualistic club to do it in. Personally,  I would rather have experienced more about Sidda's relationship with her  boyfriend. He seemed really wonderful ! Who WAS that guy?	2000-04-29

I love studying them. That was the compelling reason that drew me to this book when I first saw it on the new book shelf at my library. It's rare for me not to finish a book, and I did finish this one. However, I found this book to be one of the most manipulative reads I  have ever encountered. As a teacher and parent, and, above all, a former  child myself, I found the main character to be one of the most menacing  individuals written about. Why? Because she was entrusted with the safety  and well-being of not only her friend's children but also her own. When an  adult has children in their care, the number one priority is to keep them  safe from harm.  She should have taken that child with her upstair, and she  should have had latches on the door to keep all of the children from  leaving the house. Since she had problems with her emotions, which many  people have at one time or another, she should have done something about  it. Yes, it's hard to move to another environment, and I know that from  experience, but she  could have done things to make her life more enjoyable  without spending a cent. I cannot feel sorry for this woman, and I resent  the  author for trying to manipulate me into doing so. I feel sorry for the  people she permanently  hurt: a child, who's life she took; the child's  parents, who will never recover completely; and the members of her own  family. The only powerful thing I see in this story is deserved shame.	2000-04-24

Jerome Kildee is a shy stonecutter who retires to the redwood forest to be alone. He finds,  instead, friendship for the first time in his life.
