Recommended.<br /><br />The Green Dwarf demonstrates that literary achievement owes perhaps as much to experience and craft as to ability.<br /><br />Set in the exotic colonial city of Verdopolis in Africa, The Green Dwarf is awkward on its own as a novella. It's framed at the beginning as a tale within a tale; the recuperating Lord Charles, apparently a renowned literary figure, requests his venerable friend Bud to tell him a story, which turns out to be the story of the green dwarf. There are references near the beginning and end to \\"Captain Tree,\\" who would apparently figure in other juvenilia by the Brontë siblings.<br /><br />A time-worn adage about writing is to \\"write what you know.\\" The Green Dwarf exemplifies the practical reason for this bit of wisdom; the Brontë siblings did not know Africa, so little of Verdopolis resembles a colonial African city or town. Even the descriptions of hills, glens, and forests, save for the occasional mention of a palm, evoke an English or Scottish setting, not an African one. It's also never revealed in which part of the vast African continent Verdopolis lies. The nature of the \\"African Olympic Games,\\" the characters' names, the occasional anachronism, and the plot of a lady in distress lend the Green Dwarf the air of a fairy tale in a fictional setting.<br /><br />Interestingly, Brontë's imagination is perhaps limited by her chronological age and her social and cultural experience and milieu. The piece villain says, \\"Beautiful creature . . . Behold me, fair lady, and know into whose power you have fallen!\\" A more mature or modern writer might hint at something more sinister to follow, as Brontë will later hint at Rochester's depravity and his paternity of his ward Adele, but after this ominous line the kidnapper merely gloats and then leaves to serve his country.<br /><br />The Green Dwarf's beginning and early Napoleonic aside are nonsensical, its language overblown, and its plot awkward (and interrupted by authorial intrusions such as, \\"It may now be as well to connect the broken thread of my rambling narrative before I proceed further.\\"). Brontë's imagination shines through at times, in whimsy, in images, and in words. The ailing Lord Charles is fed a diet that consists of, among other delicacies, \\". . . stewed cockchafers . . . and roasted mice.\\" In his rambles, he suddenly comes upon the green, foam-covered sea, which his \\"excited fancy\\" sees as a plains covered with \\"white flowers and tender spring grass and the thickly clustered masts of vessels . . . transformed into groves of tall, graceful trees, while the smaller craft took the form of cattle reposing in the shade\\"-quite a vision for the recovering poet. And Bertha's comment upon the arrival of Lady Emily answers its own question: \\"But what have you brought such a painted toy as this here for? There's no good in the wind, I think.\\"<br /><br />Brontë foreshadows the significance of the \\"carroty-haired hero of the cart and asses\\" when he defeats Colonel Percy's magnificent steeds and chariot in a race. She also cleverly keeps him a man of mystery: How did he win the race? How did he happen to be at the right place at the right time to find Colonel Percy's servant \\"at a very lonely part of the road\\"? If he is more than human, why does he need Colonel Percy's money to pay for his vices? Or is he a representative?<br /><br />In many ways, The Green Dwarf reads more like a play than a novella. with the awkward authorial intrusions serving as scene breaks. Even the Ashantees and their king Quashie are mere plot devices who enter the scene, breathe wind into the plot's sails, and add nothing to the drama.<br /><br />Work on The Green Dwarf and other juvenilia undoubtedly fired Brontë's continued interest in writing. She achieved success when she left Verdopolis and Africa behind and focused her imagination and her ability to convey it on what she knew and had experienced-the often difficult, lonely, isolated lives of independent, intelligent women in the 19th century, women who, like Jane Eyre, do what they believe is right at the cost of their own happiness.<br /><br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br /><br />In his chronicles of a year spent in a tiny house on Cape Cod's great beach, on a dune between ocean and dunes and marsh, Henry Beston recognises something of which many of us are no longer aware-the cyclical nature of life.<br /><br />Even the beach itself, embattled between land and ocean, wind and wave, is the result of a cycle. Beston vividly describes the many others that take place during his year, for example, the advance and retreat of the varied plant life upon the dunes and the corresponding changes in colour and tone. Even when the dunes seem dead, Beston finds life lurking in the development phase of its cycle; of the insects he says, \\" . . . yet one feels them here, the trillion, trillion tiny eggs in grass and marsh and sand, all faithfully spun from the vibrant flesh of innumerable mothers, all faithfully sealed away, all waiting for the rush of this earth through this space and the resurgence of the sun.\\"<br /><br />The cycle of night and day had been lost to most by 1925, the year of the outermost house, as Beston notes. He says, \\"Primitive people, gathered at a cave mouth round a fire, do not fear night; they fear, rather, the energies and creatures to whom night gives power . . . having delivered ourselves of nocturnal enemies, [we] now have a dislike of night itself.\\" On the beach, however, Beston can experience the \\"poetry of night\\"-beach-combing skunks, frolicking deer, stranded skates and dogfish, and great tempests and storms that ground boats and ships and drown or carry off their crews.<br /><br />Of course, life and death are part of the cycle, eloquently illustrated through tales of shipwrecks (past and present), but perhaps most poignantly shown after a great summer storm, when all that Beston finds of a least tern colony is an eggshell fragment, then, upon further exploration, discovers the song sparrow determinedly sitting on her nest, which is now only inches above the wind-piled sand. Like the Lord, the sea giveth and the sea taketh away, a way of life that is most clear when predators drive in schools of fish to feast on, only to find themselves stranded by the relentless surf.<br /><br />Immersed in all these cycles and rituals-the seasons, day and night, life and death, migration and hibernation- Beston, perhaps unconsciously, creates his own, including not only the practical such as weekly visits to town for supplies, but also the equally necessary-the regular seeking out of the Nauset light and the companionship of the Coast Guardsmen who man it and who patrol the coastline. These human contacts become the ritual of Beston's own human life, when it is not involved in observing the world and the life around him.<br /><br />Beston did not write The Outermost House with a purpose, other than to please his fianc&eacute;e; that is, his intent was not to preach or persuade but to observe and chronicle. At times, the passages ramble accordingly, but at other moments they sing, as when he says of animals, \\"They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.\\"<br /><br />Given the constant flux of the world, where a thriving colony of terns may be replaced by a storm-tossed sand dune in the course of one night, it seems appropriate that the Fo'castle, the outermost house, along with its beach, was reclaimed by the ocean during a winter storm in 1978. Knowing the ocean and the land as he did, Beston may have been surprised that the house survived as long as it did. Beston does not have to resort to preachiness for the outermost house-and its fate-to make a point about our tenuous connection to our frail world and its rhythms. The outermost house is gone.

US	52876068	R1GYNYZNCDXIJI	0767906500	876549271	Neurotica: Jewish Writers on Sex	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The people of the book, in bed	\\"Witness the people of the book, in bed.\\" Thus editor Melvin Jules Bukiet invites the reader into the intimacies of Neurotica: Jewish Writers on Sex. In this collection, everyone from Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth, and Isaac Bashevis Singer to Woody Allen and Erica Jong gets into the act of exploring sex in its many varieties-heterosexual, homosexual, incestuous, paid, humorous, poignant, intellectual, sadistic, masochistic, costumed-always from a distinctive, wry Jewish perspective. Note, though, that you don't have to be interested in erotica to appreciate Neurotica-just in good stories.<br /><br />The anthology begins with a memorable story by Woody Allen, \\"The Whores of Mensa,\\" an over-the-top private eye tale that cleverly and humorously reveals what many of us know but some have yet to discover-that sex is less a function of the nether regions and more one of the mind. This theme is continued and expanded in \\"The Courtship\\" from The Mind-Body Problem\\" by Rebecca Goldstein, in which the narrator says, \\"And I remember too the intensity of my pleasure, which wasn't at all physical . . . my head sang the triumphant thought: I am making love to this man . . . to Noam Himmel, the genius.\\" Unfortunately, \\"The Courtship\\" is marred somewhat by this ending and the tone throughout, which makes it resemble less of a literary work and more of the author's personal fantasy, or what is known in fan fiction as a \\"Mary Sue\\" story.<br /><br />Philip Roth adds imagination to the mix in an excerpt from The Counterlife in which a dentist suggest to his new assistant that they play dentist and assistant. She says, \\"Why is it so exciting when all we're pretending to be is what we are?\\" When his physical deficiencies win over his imagination, he plummets to the world that is, no what could be, which he cannot long survive.<br /><br />No matter the theme, any anthology focused on Jewish writers is bound to include references to Germans, World War II, and the Holocaust. In \\"Jews Have No Business Being Enamored of Germans,\\" Binnie Kirshenbaum's narrator confronts the Jewish self-hatred that could make a Jewish man with a \\"short and convenient view of history\\" prefer and seek out Germans and \\"Aryan intellectualism.\\" Even the narrator's parents have succumbed to  postmodern sense of tolerance or denial. \\"'Oh, none of that concerned us,' my mother waved off the Holocaust and a world war.\\"<br /><br />Michael Lowenthal takes a psychologically richer approach in \\"Infinity of Angles,\\" in which a Jewish homosexual connects with a German, only to find his would-be lover identifies too closely with the persecuted and demands an unusual punishment.<br /><br />While there's some humour in Neurotica, there is also mental illness. The two are combined in \\"Elvis, Axl, and Me\\" by Janice Eidus, who proves that Elvis isn't dead; he lives in The Bronx disguised as a Hasidic Jew. Mental illness appears again in \\"The Quality of Being a Ruby\\" by Cheryl Pearl Sucher, a thoroughly modern tale of a bipolar girl experiencing anxiety neurosis who picks up lovers, drops lithium, experiments with cocaine, and resists the advice of her protective father. \\"For Ruby, the distillation of the illness was 'Rubessence,' the perfect calm of inspired originality, the longed-for union of the desired and the real.\\"<br /><br />One of the best stories is \\"Taibele and Her Demon\\" by Isaac Bashevis Singer, who brings a fairy-tale simplicity to this complex tale of deception and love. As with any collection, there are several stories I didn't like, such as \\"Romancing the Yohrzeit Light\\" by Thane Rosenbaum, who tries too self-consciously to combine the sacred, the profane, and the silly. My favourite story was by Nathan Englander, titled \\"Peep Show.\\" The troubled protagonist asks, \\"What is a boy raised in a world of absolutes to do when he is faced with contradictions?\\" The answer is, \\"You question. That's what you do,\\" according to the nude rabbi his imagination has conjured. Despite the humorous and ludicrous situations in which the protagonist finds himself at the peep show, the tone of the story is strangely eerie in its reference to peep show nostalgia-a little like the tone of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br /><br />Although a few stories are set in places such as France, Germany, Italy, and Israel, most take place in the United States and are by Jewish-American authors. All are from the 20th century, which is disappointing since surely erotica by Jewish writers has been around at least as long as erotica by writers from other traditions. I would like to have seen more representation from other countries and time periods.<br /><br />The location and time period, however, give Neurotica a couple of themes meant to appeal to a broad audience, including assimilation and secularization. In many of these stories, the faith, traditions, and rituals of Judaism are a mystery to the characters, primarily the younger ones. Noam Himmel, the genius, is an atheist ignorant of his cultural past. At one point, his seducer says, \\"You have heard of the Talmud?\\" He says later, \\"Sometimes, especially on insomniac nights, I start worrying that there may be a God, and worse, that he may be Jewish.\\" In \\"Romancing the Yohrzeit Light,\\" Adam doesn't \\"really care to go\\" to that part of the world, and he allows his Swedish lover to extinguish his mother's yohrzeit light. Like Adam, many of the characters actively seek goyim as lovers. Some of the older people speak Yiddish, but the young people do not. Yet, while religious, cultural, and even social bonds may seem to be disintegrating with assimilation after World War II, Neurotica shows that there is still a literary voice that has not been silenced and that remains uniquely Jewish.<br /><br />Diane L.

US	52876068	R2W6JLV31XOK1W	0060629185	426810153	The Reinvention of Work: A New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time	Books	5	23	23	N	Y	Personally appealing, largely impractical	In The Reinvention of Work, Matthew Fox brings together the work of Eastern and Western mystics, ancient, medieval, and modern, to propose a new paradigm for how we work and what we do. Citing Meister Eckhart, Thomas Aquinas, Hildegard von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching, Studs Terkel, Patch Adams, and progressive economists, Fox explores the concept of work and how it can be healthier physically, emotionally, and intellectually, but primarily socially, environmentally, and spiritually.<br /><br />Fox believes that the Enlightenment and the industrial age have left us with a machine-centered, anthropocentric world that focuses on outer work and rewards at the cost of inner work and spirituality, and destroys rather than creates. Real wealth results from preserving the health of the planet, not in the artificiality of money or possessions. The result has been a world often at war, where the gaps between affluent and poor continue to spread, where the environmental health of non-industrialised nations is sacrificed for the comforts of the industrialised, and where the work that is available and that most people have serves machines and leaves the worker stressed, addicted to work, ill, angry and even violent, and unfulfilled intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.<br /><br />Fox cites mystics like Eckhart and Aquinas to show that they understood what is important and that they prophetically understood the traps that man is prone to fall into. He also recounts the stories of people who reinvent themselves through work, who are willing to sacrifice position and possessions to find an avocation that matters, like the man who gives up a high-paying position to become a fireman and who is ecstatic about the meaning it brings to his life.<br /><br />Fox carefully sets up all that is wrong with our modern concept of work and, indeed, life, since so much of who we are, how we feel, and how we live is tied up in what we do for a living, or what we mistakenly call \\"work.\\" His proposed solutions are centered around creation spirituality, which is a \\"creation-centered mysticism that is also prophetic and socially transformative.\\" While creation spirituality is not very clearly defined here-Fox has written several other books about it and refers to them-it appears to center around the idea that creation comes from within and that we create our world, which is part of a greater, interdependent cosmos that continues to undergo creation. For Fox, \\"enlightenment\\" might mean recognising and embracing creation spirituality and our responsibility and role in the ongoing creation of the cosmos-a recognition that begins with inner work and extends outer work, and that redefines wealth and poverty. Fox is quick to point out that this is neither communism nor socialism, both of which suffer from the same destructive values as capitalism.<br /><br />There are many elements involved in creation spirituality, which embraces many aspects of life that have been neglected, distorted, or abused, from education, health care, art, psychology, and sexuality to something he believes is critical yet missing or misused-ritual. In creation spirituality and the reinvention of work, properly conceived and performed ritual is meaningful, bringing people together, bringing out emotions, and acknowledging what has been done in the name of war, destruction, and hate. Ritual can also be playful and energising, for example, circle dances. Whatever the focus, ritual brings us together to share our common joys and sorrows. Ritual heals.<br /><br />Mysticism appeals to me, and Fox's assessments of what's wrong and what could be done to change our course make sense and are supported by the quotes he provides from a  broad array of sources, including psychologists, economists, writers, and artists. The consequences of not changing are clear, but it is equally clear that those consequences have not penetrated to either the masses or their leaders. (Even the rising price of gasoline in 2005 has not inspired any more than cautious apprehension.) We are like smokers who are able to quit our habit only when terminal lung cancer has been diagnosed.<br /><br />To get billions of conditioned consumers (and their consumers-in-training children) to give up their increasingly complex lifestyles, comforts, and amusements in the interest of a healthier, more just world for all and for better personal mental and physical health requires a utopian change that most people will not embrace. As with the Woolgers in their book, The Goddess Within, Fox tries to find a movement in the mid-1990s that has not materialised yet. Generally, people do not choose to change; they are forced to. Perhaps someday, when the gaps have widened too far, and society and our home can no longer support our appetites (and the corresponding waste), we may be ready to listen to Fox and his adherents, at which point they will need to provide practical answers. Who will \\"make ritual\\"? Who will produce the necessities and how? Who will distribute them? How will they be paid, or what will replace a monetary/barter economy? What if there is imbalance between what people want to do and what needs to be done? In practical, everyday terms, what does the reinvention of work look like? And do I want to live long enough to experience the disasters that are likely to be required to bring it about?<br /><br />Eckhart, Aquinas, von Bingen, the Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching-all wise beyond their times.

Recommended.<br /><br />Like Winter's Tale and A Soldier of the Great War, Memoir from Antproof Case is difficult to classify (although Helprin helpfully gives it the subtitle A Novel). It has elements of magical surrealism, but falls short on magic.<br /><br />In this sprawling fictional memoir, Oscar Progresso (not his real name, as though he were a real person) slowly and circumspectly reveals the cause of his pathological aversion to coffee, but first distracts the reader with red herrings like coffee's allegedly toxic chemistry, the over-the-top portrayal of addiction to it, and its amphetamine-like effect on its purported victims.<br /><br />The real cause is tragic but, given the tone of the novel, it's hard to feel deeply for Oscar, the son of poor parents, graduate of Harvard University (and a Swiss mental institution), globe-trotting partner in an investment banking firm, WWII flying ace, and husband of a billionaire. The details of few of his stories are probable-how he killed two men, his life in the mental institution or even as a pilot during the war, the redundancy of the opulence of his life with Constance (how many kitchens is even a mansion likely to have?) or how she came to leave him. Then there is the drawn-out fall from power as an investment banker, from deciding the future of entire nations to being relegated to a carved wooden school desk in an unlit janitor's closet and then to pointlessly shifting gold in the vaults with a class of unquestioning troglodyte humans; the culmination of this work is the most improbably event of all.<br /><br />If there is any doubt about Oscar's sanity, his reaction to being unable to find a larger antproof case should resolve it.<br /><br />There are only two areas in which Oscar seems somewhat trustworthy. The first is the underlying story of his aversion to coffee, the story that is slowly and painstakingly revealed, and the other is his love for his wife's son by another man, the boy he once was for only a short time.<br /><br />I found myself wanting less of the whimsy and surrealism, imaginative and fascinating as it is, and more of the heart and soul that must inspire some of Oscar's interjected and concluding thoughts, for example:<br /><br />\\"Though the world is constructed to serve glory, success, and strength, one loves one's parents and one's children despite their failings and weaknesses-sometimes even more on account of them. In this school, you learn the measure not of power, but of love; not of victory, but of grace; not of triumph, but of forgiveness . . . With it [love, devotion, life as an device for the exercise of faith], your heart, though broken, will be full, and you will stay in the fight unto the very last.\\"<br /><br />As with Winter's Tale and A Soldier of the Great War, the voice is poetic and unique and the characters etched, while the events purposely stretch the credulity of the reader (if not the narrator). Memoir from Antproof Case tries to appeal to both the imagination and the heart, but, like its predecessors, sacrifices the latter for the former. This is unfortunate, because it has the potential to be the most human of the three. Instead of feeling for Oscar Progresso and his losses and lessons, I am left thinking he is a madman and an unreliable narrator who cannot escape the obsession and fantasy he has created and now clings to; my empathy remains uncertain and unclaimed. I cannot even be sure that the one story Oscar tells that rings true really is-the one of his childhood tragedy.<br /><br />Helprin is close to being a great novelist but there is something cold and intellectual in his approach and style that prevents him from breaking through as, for example, Toni Morrison has. Although he has experienced life, it is rarely clear that he has felt it. Like Oscar and some of his previous characters, Helprin seems more observer than participant, which ultimately detracts from the magic and surrealism. Part of what make something magical is a belief that it could be possible in some way or some world; much of Oscar's narrative is possible only in a madman's mind.<br /><br />Memoir from Antproof Case is worth the read, especially for Helprin fans, but it is more fancy appetizer than satisfying main course.<br /><br />Aside: My copy of Memoir from Antproof Case is stained with coffee.<br /><br />Diane L.

In it, Michael Farquhar has collected charming tales of Europe's royal elite at their finest-fornicating, battling, murdering, backstabbing, beheading, inbreeding, prancing, politicking, and going stark raving mad. You'll read about the touching love of Philip the Fair for Joanna the Mad (who's called that for a reason, as you'll see), the familial love of Napoleon for his brothers, and the not-so-familial love of Caligula for his sister.<br /><br />Farquhar's gift is not so much for digging up tales of shame, but for the irreverent sarcasm with which he dishes them out. Of King Frederick William of Prussia: \\"The reply [to his son] was written in the glowing warmth of the third person.\\" \\"Peter the Great was what might be best described as a super-tsar.\\" [Groan.] \\"If Louis XIV was France's Sun King, then his brother, Philippe, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, was its Drag Queen.\\"<br /><br />Sarcasm and bad puns aside, let's get back to the comparison to The National Enquirer. Unless you are truly the type who subscribes to Playboy/Playgirl for the articles, chances are that you read The National Enquirer for the titillating hints of the scandals, improprieties, infidelities, gifts to the Democratic Party, and other acts calculated to provoke moral outrage that today's royal icons, celebrities have virtually trademarked.<br /><br />If you have any common sense (and how would you? Look at what you're reading!), of course you realise that little of The National Enquirer is burdened by the weight of the truth, but it is seasoned just right to tempt your sense of gullibility. (For example, a cover lamenting Cher's \\"heartbreaking disease\\"-surely cancer, or at least diabetes?-led to a story about her deadly adult acne problem.)<br /><br />Farquhar takes much the same approach to his subject. Royal Scandals is replete with \\"reported that\\" qualifiers as well as apocryphal stories.

Not recommended.<br /><br />Master and Commander is the first in a series of Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin novels, this one set in the early 1800s. After meeting Dr. Maturin at a concert by annoying him, Aubrey learns he has been promoted to master and commander (with honorary title of captain) of His Majesty's sloop Sophie. How Aubrey earned this promotion is unclear, as his womanising ways seems to have irritated his commandant and everyone else, although women seem to have played a role in obtaining it.<br /><br />There are several problems with Master and Commander. The first is O'Brian's fixation on his knowledge of sailing and sailing terminology. At one point, he spends pages having a crew member explaining the rigging in painstaking-and painful-detail to Dr. Maturin. There is little purpose to this, as most laymen will find it difficult and tedious to follow, and a knowledgeable person will want to skip it altogether. It adds nothing but volume to the book and proof that O'Brian did his research.<br /><br />O'Brian provides no historical context for the story. England is at war with France and Spain, but even Bonaparte is rarely mentioned. The characters reference naval actions like the battle of the Nile, but these incidents have meaning only to the characters since the reader is never privy to the context or greater strategy.<br /><br />While Aubrey, Dr. Maturin, James Dillon, and the master are interesting characters, most of the rest of the crew is intentionally faceless. The men in key positions, like the bosun, are rarely referred to by name. Even Marshall is known primarily as \\"the master,\\" making the attempt to give him a personality by alluding to him as an apprehensive pederast futile.<br /><br />There is neither much story nor much action here. It takes the first quarter of the novel for Sophie to leave port for the first time under Aubrey's command. The novel's big battle, during which Sophie miraculously defeats a bigger, better-manned ship, is so hurried and poorly recounted that there is no tension or suspense about how the encounter will play out or end. The victory evokes no sense of exhilaration in the reader, so the ensuing letdown (no promotions, no cruise) loses its emotional impact.<br /><br />Even the most intriguing aspect of the novel, the relationships between Aubrey and Dillon, Dillon and Dr. Maturin, and Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, are poorly drawn, partially because the point of view is inconsistent. As a clinician and researcher, Dr. Maturin is the relatively objective observer and link between Aubrey and Dillon. He knows Dillon's secrets (as well as his own) and the thoughtless bias behind Aubrey's anti-Papist rants, but is reduced to expressing his thoughts and feelings of affection, frustration and disgust mainly to his journal, as though he were documenting an illness.<br /><br />Master and Commander has tremendous potential, but O'Brian doesn't have the literary skills or ability to craft a great read. His prose is ordinary at best, and history, drama, suspense, plot, and even characterisation are given short shrift. For more compelling naval adventures set during the same period, read the Horatio Hornblower series, which is much better conceived and written and which is far more evocative.<br /><br />Note: The colours of the movie tie-in edition cover are pastel blue and yellow-a very odd choice, given the subject matter and target audience.<br /><br />Diane L.

Woolger. Not recommended.<br /><br />The Goddess Within is an attempt to explore and explain contemporary psychological issues and social trends through the ancient Greek goddesses Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hera, Persephone, and Demeter. The premise is based on the idea that the whole goddess of more matriarchal times has been divided and wounded, that patriarchal society suffers due to the resulting imbalance, and that we need to restore the balance and the multiple roles and energies of the goddess (and women).<br /><br />One problem with The Goddess Within is reflected in the subtitle. There are no goddesses that shape women's lives; rather, humans shaped the goddesses-including their splintering. At times, the authors seem to forget that distinction, especially when they make such statements as: \\". . . the two goddesses who are, so to speak, expressing their larger grievance through the two women.\\" Perhaps it is simply the two women expressing their own grievances, which they have in common with other women.<br /><br />The most basic problem, however, is the division of everything into the masculine and feminine. Is the earth really female? The moon? Why is the sun male? The authors talk at length about the moon, but never acknowledge that, without the \\"male\\" sun, there would be no nurturing of life on earth. Why is intellect a male attribute? Emotion female? Are these the kind of labels that reveal human psychology or repress a deeper exploration? Since each goddess is held to represent certain traits, are they necessary at all? Can six goddesses represent the \\"feminine\\" in its entirety? Essentially, psychology can be made to fit into any system desired.<br /><br />What is more troubling, however, is the authors' claim that \\"balance\\" is missing in our patriarchal world and their insistence that a matriarchy should replace it. The amount of gratuitous male bashing leaves no doubt about how they truly feel about \\"balance.\\" For example: \\"Growing Athena soon learns to curb her frustration at male stupidity and ineptitude, however\\" and \\"All men have in them heroes, lovers, fathers, leaders, listeners, protectors of one kind or another and it is never too asking too much to make the long overdue sacrifice of the whining little boy that prevents their emergence.\\" The message throughout is that everything wrong with the world, from war to pollution, is due to masculine thinking.<br /><br />The authors also bring a great deal of personal bias to their discussion. They believe that Demeter (motherhood) is undervalued and suggest that mothers be allowed to return to their jobs after being granted five-year leaves-a greater privilege than National Guardsmen have. They don't point out that someone must fill Demeter's shoes involuntarily-perhaps even a type who doesn't want to work extra hours and who would like to experience life, too. (I've done my share of working late so mothers can get to daycare and events on time-my own admitted bias.) They say that families with children are relegated to fast-food restaurants and blue-collar diners, another phenomenon that doesn't fit in with my observations.<br /><br />That leads to another problem-The Goddess Within seems dated. Writing in 1989, the authors discuss \\"movements\\" that the average American today has not heard of-suggesting they are not so much movements as the typical handful of people from each generation who deviate from societal norms. There has been no growing return to rural living; if anything, suburbs continue to expand. There is no growing sensitivity toward the \\"earth goddess\\" among the masses. What the authors label \\"patriarchal values\\"-war, conquest, corporate power, degradation of the earth-are even stronger today. If the question is one of balance of matriarchal and patriarchal values, as the Woolgers define them, the world is as or more out of balancethan ever.<br /><br />The Woolgers, however, do not seem to propose balance, but a return to the matriarchy, where patriarchal Christianity as practiced and rational science (which they tuck in together as odd bedfellows) are subject to the goddess-ignoring the benefits that Christianity and science have given western society and focusing only on the harm they have done. For example, science has brought us nuclear weapons, but it has also contributed cures, treatments, and surgeries for ailments that would have killed millions of us early in life.<br /><br />Rarely do the Woolgers mention the gods-and then it is primarily as consorts to the goddesses (or, in Zeus's case, as the ultimate patriarch). If balance of these values should be the goal of the individual and society, why not The Gods and Goddesses Within: A Guide to the Eternal Myths That Shape Men's and Women's Lives? In their slavish devotion to the feminine (and feminist), the Woolgers devalue the masculine. To them, \\"no matter how much a doting father adores and is adored by his daughter, he is still far from a mother's love of her little girl. He did not bear her in his body; he cannot experience that great mystery.\\" Is this really true? Does every woman who bears children experience it as a \\"great mystery\\"? And what of the great mysteries that men can and do experience? It is this lack of balance and wholeness that undermines the Woolgers' claims.<br /><br />Some women (and men) may find the goddess portraits very useful in assessing themselves and the women in their lives (for example, the Hera mother is easily identifiable) as well as their relationships. The goddess portraits and sidebars are also somewhat useful in the study of Greek and Roman mythology. Beyond that, however, The Goddess Within is little more than trendy, empty, male-bashing feminism  of the worst kind.<br /><br />My goddess scores:<br /><br />Athena (goddess of wisdom)-17<br />Artemis (goddess of the wilds)-29<br />Aphrodite (goddess of love)-22<br />Hera (queen of heaven)-9<br />Persephone (goddess of the underworld)-23<br />Demeter (goddess of life)-1<br /><br />Diane L.

You don't have to imagine it; it's emerged from the rain forest of Africa. In The Hot Zone, Richard Preston covers the filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola, from their effects on victims, how they are spread, and various outbreaks to the horrifying discovery of an Ebola strain right outside the U.S. capital, in Reston, Virginia.<br /><br />To shatter our complacency, Preston begins The Hot Zone by detailing how a French expatriate, \\"Charles Monet,\\" undergoes the transformation from healthy human being to a Marburg virus host undergoing extreme amplification within days. His fate is to \\"crash and bleed out\\"-to throw up the \\"black vomit,\\" go into shock, slough intestinal lining, and lose copious amounts of blood from every orifice. This is a true horror story that Poe could not have imagined-yet it is what happens in 50-90 percent of similar cases. There is not only no cure for the filoviruses Marburg and Ebola, there is no treatment.<br /><br />When the Army and the Centers for Disease Control (inexplicably abbreviated C.D.C.) discover there is an outbreak of an Ebola-like agent in a research monkey holding facility in Reston, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C., a team of virologists, veterinarians, physicians, and technicians go into action to identify and isolate the agent, to euthanize the monkeys, and to kill all life within the building.<br /><br />Preston follows the daily life of Jerry and Nancy Jaax, both Army veterinarians; Dan Dalgard, consulting veterinarian to the company that imported the monkeys from the Philippines; researchers Gene Johnson and Peter Jahrling; intern Tom Geisbert; Colonel C. J. Peters; and others as they develop and execute a strategy for containing the virus (named by co-discoverers Jahrling and Geisbert Ebola Reston) within the monkey facility population and to protect humans from exposure.<br /><br />Preston plays up the melodrama inherent in the story. He shows the ordinary home life of the Jaaxes, feeding their children, picking them up from school events, and taking care of their pets. In contrast, Nancy dons a \\"space suit\\" to work in relatively safety around Level 4 biohazard agents like Marburg and Ebola. Geisbert is a young father who has sacrificed his marriage to his work. Gene Johnson is unable to write about his research and has recurring nightmares about a breech in his gloves. While Army teams are \\"nuking\\" the monkey facility, killing and carving up monkeys that host what was believed to be a virulent, deadly hot agent, children play happily at the day-care center down the hill. These juxtapositions of normal life with scenes of people in space suits in fear for their lives from Ebola are intended to add to the horror. While life goes on, a particularly grisly kind of death is only steps away.<br /><br />I found the attitude of the veterinarians difficult to understand. Dan Dalgard euthanizes monkeys to see if they have simian hemorrhagic fever (SHF). They prove to be healthy. Preston writes, \\"Sacrificing the monkeys had been a difficult, disgusting, disheartening task\\"-a sentiment the other veterinarians echo throughout the book. Dalgard notes, \\". . . the animals were unusually well fleshed (butterballs), young (less than 5 years), and in prime condition.\\" Yet even as he feels the \\"disgust\\" of sacrificing the monkeys, he doesn't question the ethics of working for a company that takes these young, healthy, \\"butterball\\" non-human primates away from their natural habitat and family groups and sells them to researchers at a profit-researchers who will most likely inflict pain and suffering on them in the course of research.<br /><br />Later, to ease the distress of what they are about to do, one of the Army officers tells the young privates sent to assist in killing the monkeys and collecting samples, \\"These animals gave their lives to science.\\" This may be comforting to humans, but misses the mark. Animals don't give their lives to science; their lives are taken from them involuntarily. Five hundred monkeys need not have been euthanized had they not been artificially housed together, amplifying the filovirus's ability to spread.<br /><br />At points, Preston sacrifices science for drama. When he writes, \\"moths and insects\\" and \\"a monkey or perhaps a baboon,\\" one assumes he knows that moths are insects and that baboons are monkeys. He refers to monkey canines as \\"canine fangs\\" or simply \\"fangs\\" to heighten the sense of danger-but zoologists typically would not use \\"fangs\\" in this sense. There are occasionally contradictory statements. In the middle, Ebola is shown to travel through air. By the end, this has become, \\"You have to wonder if Ebola virus can do that or not,\\" Peters notes.<br /><br />The Hot Zone left me with unanswered questions. Why didn't the virus appear during the 30-day quarantine after the monkeys were imported? Why did Hazleton Research Products import more monkeys from the same source, given the likelihood they would be infected? Why was the second outbreak in the monkey house allowed to burn through the population, causing a cruel death to the monkeys? Why did the company, the Army, and the CDC treat the second outbreak so casually (once they realised Ebola Reston did not affect humans), although today the same filovirus strain requires Level 4 biohazard handling, the same as for the deadly Ebola Zaire strain?<br /><br />The Hot Zone is a horrifying, compelling story adequately told. In the wake of 9/11/01, it is also a timely one; today, filoviruses are considered bioterrorism threats (although who would want to handle them?). When you're falling asleep in at night, imagine what else lurks among the life of the rain forest-and consider that the forest may yet have the final word.<br /><br />Diane L.

In the first part, Dr. Redlich describes \\"Hitler's Life from Birth to Death,\\" including such topics as \\"Entry into Politics,\\" \\"Ascent to Power,\\" and \\"Warlord.\\" The second part, \\"Review, Comments, and Interpretations,\\" delves into more detail about the medical and psychological issues brought up in the first section.<br /><br />This first part is the more problematic one. Dr. Redlich is not a historian and is not equipped to present or interpret history, especially history as fraught with the unknowns, distortions, and lies that surround Hitler. For example, he refers to the \\"billy goat story\\" several times. He notes that Hitler was not known to be cruel to animals as a child, except for the \\"dubious\\" billy goat story-a highly unlikely story of questionable origin that no historian would cite as an exception, even with the \\"dubious\\" qualifier.<br /><br />He also discusses Geri Raubal's death but provides no insight into what actually happened or how Hitler reacted to it. He briefly discusses a few innuendoes that Raubal was murdered, but there is nothing here-about a critical moment in Hitler's psychological life-that is not covered more thoroughly and carefully in other books (Ron Rosenbaum's Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil, for example). On the other hand, there is sometimes too much detail about Himmler, Goebbels, et. al, which does not particularly relate to Hitler, his health, his psychology, or his actions. Indeed, much of the first section could have been eliminated as it often provides irrelevant information or biographical detail that is explored better in Hitler biographies and Nazi and WWII histories.<br /><br />In the second part, Dr. Redlich attempts to diagnose Hitler, based on the scant and unreliable information available. He dismisses diagnoses when there is too little evidence or the known symptoms are inconclusive, although given that there is so little information and that neither Hitler nor anyone surrounding him is a reliable source, it is still primarily speculation. Dr. Redlich does conclude that Hitler had Parkinson's syndrome, of unknown etiology, although at one point he mistakenly refers to it as Parkinson's disease. He also provides a plausible explanation for Hitler's headaches.<br /><br />In his discussion of Hitler's psychology, Dr. Redlich covers anxiety, depression, sexuality, and other obvious topics (often inconclusively) as well as such things as his lies and ambivalence. Again, there is nothing conclusive to say; many of these questions are still hotly debated by Hitler scholars (for example, whether he believed or came to believe his own fabrications).<br /><br />The question of cruelty is an interesting one. It's easy to say that Hitler was cruel, given the death, destruction, persecution, and torture he wrought against dissenting Nazi Party members, Gypsies, Jews, and others. This gets short shrift in Dr. Redlich's analysis, because it's not clear that Hitler was cruel in the conventional way many of us might think. Someone who gains pleasure from kicking a dog or witnessing the kicking of a dog is clearly cruel-but generally Hitler did not directly participate in or even witness what was happening in the concentration camps. He kept his distance from it. More discussion of such detached cruelty and distancing, with real-life examples, might be useful.<br /><br />The reader does learn a great deal about the mundane details of Hitler's health (including his ongoing problems with flatulence, which Dr. Redlich does not quite connect to his vegetarian diet), about the doctors who treated him, and about some of the medical practices still used in the 1940s (includingleeches).<br /><br />Dr. Redlich's ultimate diagnosis of Hitler is one that few lay persons would recognize; it is part of the title. Hitler saw morality simplistically in black-and-white terms, he believed he'd been chosen by a higher power to do what he did (and was afraid he would not live long enough to accomplish it), and found a convenient scapegoat (the Jews) around whom to rally his followers. This is a cautionary tale that is especially relevant in today's international political arena.<br /><br />It's important to note that Dr. Redlich's effort could have been more condensed and focused. In addition, he is not a writer and fails to make what are necessary paragraph breaks to large chunks of text with multiple subjects (as does his editor).<br /><br />Given how little is known of Hitler and how much of his own history he falsified, it would have been difficult to have produced a definitive work. Dr. Redlich honestly describes his personal reasons for writing Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet, which ultimately is not a particularly significant contribution to the Hitler literature. Those who wish to try to understand every aspect of Hitler's life (including his flatulence and bad teeth) or who wish to recognize political paranoia wherever it rages may find this a must-read.<br /><br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br /><br />In Egdon Heath, Thomas Hardy creates an otherworld consisting of the elements earth, wind, fire, and water, populated by a witch condemned by a pious woman's spell, a Christian ruled by pagan beliefs, an assortment of other odd characters, and the native of the title whose return precipitates a series of tragic events.<br /><br />The Return of the Native is centered around Eustacia Vye, a beautiful outsider wrenched from the society she craves by orphanhood and exiled to live on Egdon Heath with her maternal grandfather. Spoiled, vain, fickle, and selfish, Eustacia is not a sympathetic heroine. Although she claims to belong to Damon Wildeve (\\"body and soul\\" in one uncensored version), she really belongs to whomever can grant her what she desires and, in her mind, deserves. While Wildeve is a step above the local rabble, Eustacia can never fully commit herself to him. Each time she considers it, she is held back by the thought that even he lacks something and that surely she can do better. \\"He's not great enough for me to give myself to-he does not suffice for my desire! . . . If he had been a Saul or a Bonaparte-ah! But to break my marriage vow for him-it is too poor a luxury!\\"<br /><br />In another place, like the Paris Eustacia longs for, she would have become a mistress or a courtesan-the consort of a powerful man or men. On Egdon Heath, however, there are neither powerful men nor courtesans. There is only Damon, an equally fickle young man who hotly desires that which he cannot have-sometimes Eustacia, sometimes the naïve Thomasin Yeobright. To complicate matters, Thomasin's cousin Clym returns from Paris, where he has a financially rewarding and spiritually stifling career. In Eustacia's eyes (blinded to what she doesn't want to see, just as Clym's sight becomes literally blurred to that which he does want to see), Clym appears to be the ideal replacement for Wildeve.<br /><br />In his introduction to the \\"standard edition,\\" John Paterson, talks about the censorship of The Return of the Native and its anti-Christianity elements. The novel, at least in this form, appears to be more anti-Christian than anti-Christianity. Eustacia, with her beauty; aloof and lonely snobbishness; hold over men such as Wildeve and Clym and boys such as \\"the little slave\\" Johnny Nunsuch and the adolescent Charley; and habit of haunting Rainbarrow at all hours of the night, can easily appear to fit the role of the Egdon Heath witch. Yet it is the churchgoing Susan Nunsuch who falls prey to superstition, believing that Eustacia has afflicted her son with illness. She stabs Eustacia with a needle during one of the young lady's rare church appearances. Ironically, in the end Susan is the witch, fashioning a likeness of Eustacia and practicing a homegrown form of obeah upon it.<br /><br />Susan's male counterpart, the ironically named Christian, is no better. Simple-minded, naïve, and condemned to perpetual bachelorhood, Christian is pious not for love of God but for fear of life. He is ruled by superstition, and it requires little effort for Wildeve to convince him he is lucky and that he should gamble (as it turns out, with money that isn't his, adding theft to his sins).<br /><br />Like Egdon Heath itself (\\"oozing lumps of fleshy fungi . . . like the rotten liver and lungs of some colossal animal\\"), the remainder of its inhabitants-the ones from whom Eustacia wishes to escape-are unflinchingly, unchangingly pagan, with Christian's own reprobate father, Granfer Cantle, setting the example. They avoid inconveniences like church; they gleefully celebrate Guy Fawkes Day with fire and dance; they gossip without undue concern for good or bad. These are the folks from whom Mrs. Yeobright and the stoic pagan Diggory Venn (the reddleman) wish to save Thomasin's reputation-as though it matters to them.<br /><br />These are also the people among whom Eustacia is a queen. When she says, \\"HowI have tried and tried to be a splendid woman and how destiny has been against me!\\" the reader is hard pressed to find Eustacia's efforts to better herself, other than trying to determine which man will best launch her into society. With his Paris connections, Clym is the obvious choice, yet it is Wildeve who turns out to have better prospects-and the will to take advantage of them.<br /><br />Queen among the heathens of the heath, Eustacia is blissfully unaware of the probability that, in the Parisian society she aspires to, she would be one among many and might find herself unable to compete with the elite courtesans, mistresses, and wives of Paris. \\"I was capable of much,\\" she claims. Hardy, however, never makes clear what this \\"much\\" might be exactly, as Eustacia's intelligence, learning, and wit are incompletely and imperfectly portrayed, and one does not make a splash in society based on looks and pride alone. Eustacia hasn't \\"tried and tried\\"; and her youthful, ambitious impatience has led her to miss the clues that Clym is not going to \\"try and try,\\" either. Perhaps she, like Sue in Jude the Obscure, represents the dilemma of the intelligent woman in the 1800s, who can shape her own destiny only through attachment to the right man in a socially acceptable way. When that fails (Eustacia), or if an alternative means is attempted (Sue), tragedy is inevitable.<br /><br />While not Hardy's best, The Return of the Native is a must read for his readers, incorporating a grim yet objective setting, memorable characters, and a tragic plot driven by human failings more so than the destiny at which Eustacia rails.

US	52876068	R347ZELI7CAUL0	014044615X	543411005	The Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Man of mystery with a mission	The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re. Highly recommended.<br /><br />As translator Robin Buss points out in his introduction, many of those who haven't read The Count of Monte Cristo assume it is a children's adventure story, complete with daring prison escape culminating in a simple tale of revenge. There is very little for children in this very adult tale, however. Instead, the rich plot combines intrigue, betrayal, theft, drugs, adultery, presumed infanticide, torture, suicide, poisoning, murder, lesbianism, and unconventional revenge.<br /><br />Although the plot is roughly linear beginning with Edmond Dant&egrave;s' return to Marseille, prenuptial celebration, and false imprisonment and ending with his somewhat qualified triumphant departure from Marseille and France, Dumas uses the technique of interspersing lengthy anecdotes throughout. The story of Cardinal Spada's treasure, the origins of the Roman bandit Luigi Vampa (the least germane to the novel), Bertuccio's tale of his vendetta, and the account of the betrayal and death of Ali Pasha are few of the more significant stories-within-the-novel. While Dumas devotes an entire chapter to bandit Luigi Vampa's background, he cleverly makes only a few references to what will remain the plot's chief mystery-how the youthful, intelligent, and naive sailor Edmond Dant&egrave;s transforms himself into the worldly, jaded, mysterious Renaissance man and Eastern philosopher, the count of Monte Cristo, presumably sustained by his own advice of \\"wait\\" and \\"hope.\\"<br /><br />This novel is not a simple tale of simple revenge. The count does not kill his enemies; he brilliantly uses their vices and weaknesses against them. Caderousse's basic greed is turned against him, while Danglars loses the only thing that has any meaning for him. Fernand is deprived of the one thing that he had that he had never earned-his honour. In the process, he loses the source of his initial transgression, making his fate that much more poignant. The plot against Villefort is so complicated that even Monte Cristo loses control of it, resulting in doubt foreign to his nature and remorse that he will not outlive.<br /><br />This long but generally fast-paced is set primarily in Marseille, Rome, and Paris. It begins with Dant&egrave;s' arrival in Marseille aboard the commercial vessel Pharaon and ends with his departure from Marseille aboard his private yacht, accompanied by the young, beautiful Greek princess Hayd&eacute;e. What gives The Count of Monte Cristo its life, however, are the times in which it is set-the Revolution, the Napoleonic era, the First and Second Restoration, and the Revolution of 1830. Life-and-death politics motivates many of the characters and keeps the plot moving. Dumas also uses real people in minor roles, such as Countess G- (Byron's mistress) and the Roman hotelier Signor Pastrini, which adds to the novel's sense of historical veracity.<br /><br />The most troubling aspect of The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmond Dant&egrave;s himself. His claim to represent a higher justice seems to justify actions and inactions that are as morally reprehensible as those that sent him to prison, for example, his account of how he acquired Ali and his loyalty. Had he not discovered young Morrel's love for Valentine Villefort, she too might have become an innocent victim. As it is, there are at least two other innocents who die, although one clearly would not have been an innocent for long based on his behaviour in the novel. One wonders of Dant&egrave;s' two father figures, his own flower-loving father and fellow prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, would have approved of the count.<br /><br />The translation appears to be good, with a few slips into contemporary English idioms that sound out of place. In his introduction, Buss states that the later Danglars and Fernand have become unrecognizable and that Fernand in particular has been transformed \\"from the brave and honest Spaniard with asharp sense of honour . . . to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been dedicated to a series of betrayals.\\" There is never anything honest or honourable about Fernand; his very betrayal of Edmond is merely the first we know of in his lifelong pattern.<br /><br />What seems extreme and somewhat unrealistic about Fernand is his transformation from an uneducated Catalan fisherman into a \\"Parisian aristocrat,\\" hobnobbing with statesmen, the wealthy, and the noteworthy of society. This, however, is the result of the milieu that the novel inhabits. During these post-Revolution, post-Napoleonic years, Fernand could rise socially through his military and political accomplishments just as Danglars does through his financial acumen. Danglars is careful to note that the difference between them is that Fernand insists upon his title, while Danglars is openly indifferent to and dismissive of his; his viewpoint is the more aristocratic.<br /><br />Countess G- is quick to point out that there is no old family name of Monte Cristo and that the count, like many other contemporaries, has purchased his title. It serves mainly to obscure his identity, nationality, and background and to add to the aura of mystery his persona and Eastern knowledge create. What is most telling is that his entr&eacute;e into Parisian society is based primarily on his great wealth, not his name. Dumas reinforces this point with Andrea Cavalcanti, another mystery man of unknown name and reputed fortune.<br /><br />I have read The Man in the Iron Mask and The Three Musketeers series, both of which surprised me with their dark aspects (the character and fate of Lady de Winter, for example) and which little resembled the adventure stories distilled from them for children and for film. When I overheard a college student who was reading The Count of Monte Cristo on the bus tell a friend that she couldn't put it down, I was inspired to read it. I couldn't put it down, either, with its nearly seamless plot, dark protagonist, human villains, turbulent historical setting, and larger-than-life sense of mystery. At 1,078 pages, it's imposing, but don't cheat yourself by settling for an abridged version. You'll want to pick up every nuance.<br /><br />Diane L.

H. Lawrence. Edited by John Worthen with an introduction and notes by Brian Finney. Recommended.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In The Prussian Officer and Other Stories, D. H. Lawrence explores in short story form the themes that dominate many of his best-known novels. \\"The Daughters of the Vicar,\\" for example, echoes both Women in Love and Sons and Lovers, where one relationship is out of balance and the other shows some promise, and where a son is in near-complete subjection to his mother-even after her death. The question left unanswered at the end of \\"Daughters\\" is whether collier Alfred Durant will be any more successful at forming a lasting relationship with Louisa than artist Paul Morel was. The answer would seem to be \\"yes\\" since he and Louisa are to be married soon-although in the other stories, marriage does not mean a meaningful or lasting relationship has been achieved. It's up to reader speculation whether they will end up like the couple in \\"The White Stocking\\" or the couple in \\"The Odour of Chrysanthemums.\\"<br /><br />Lawrence's world is focused on dominance and subjection, whether sexual, social, or economic, and the resulting imbalances. For all their social loftiness, the vicar's family is as poor or poorer than the uneducated colliers whom coal mining (ironically) elevates economically if not socially. As in the mines, there is a going down and coming up of the classes, with the declining rural gentry no better off than the rising class of miners and their managers. Lawrence experienced the mixing of these disparate groups in his own family, with his educated and domineering mother and his ignorant and brutal father. It's not difficult to find the origins of Elizabeth and Walter Bates in \\"The Odour of Chrysanthemums.\\" In this story, Lawrence overtly articulates the alienation the wife feels from her husband, once death has given her the objective distance to realise it.<br /><br />While compelling, this story demonstrates what I believe is Lawrence's predominant weakness-a heavy handedness of the author's voice in the narration of thought. Across all the stories (and the novels), his characters have similar thoughts and reactions, often expressed in similar terms that seem unlikely and unnatural for those particular characters. In many cases, you could lift entire sentences and even passages with little revision and transplant them seamlessly into any of his other stories or novels. While most critics, better informed than I about Lawrence's social and cultural milieu and his artistic intent, understand this as part of his \\"metaphysic,\\" I find it artificial and tiresome. Reading so many stories together in a compressed time period highlights their similarities in theme, tone, and point of view.<br /><br />As an example, this passage sounds less like the voice of the wife of a dead collier and than that of Lawrence himself: \\"There were the children-but the children belonged to life. This dead man had nothing to do with them. He and she were only channels through which life had flowed to issue in the children.\\" At a certain level, many of Lawrence's characters have no voice that is recognizable as their own-only as his. They are in subjugation to his dominance, which burdens and overwhelms this collection.<br /><br />Two stories that stand out are set in the military: \\"The Prussian Officer\\" (originally \\"Honour and Arms\\") and \\"The Thorn in the Flesh.\\" In the former, a young orderly revenges himself on his rigid and sexually sadistic captain, then dies blindly to restore the balance. In the latter, the runaway soldier and his country servant girlfriend find spiritual elevation and detachment from their mundane concerns in their sexual unification. They are free to face the repercussions of their respective transgressionswith indifference. \\"A Fragment of Stained Glass\\" is memorable for its medieval setting, sadism, and eeriness, but is flawed by a particularly weak ending that adds nothing and detracts from the tale's previous tone.<br /><br />The Prussian Officer and Other Stories is a must for anyone interested in Lawrence and his development. Most of these stories are unforgettable, partly because of their symbolism and partly because they integrate pieces of Lawrence's overarching metaphysic. As a side note, my favourite Lawrence story-indeed, one of my favourite short stories by any author-is not part of this collection: the haunting \\"The Rocking-Horse Winner.\\"<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />6 September 2004.<br /><br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br /><br /> In The Devil in the White City, Erik Larson has turned what could be a dry retelling of the facts into a suspenseful story of creation, destruction, and insanity, focusing on architect Daniel Hudson Burnham, serial killer H. H. Holmes, and disturbed young man Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast. How will Burnham complete the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition on time? In the midst of the world's fair excitement, will anyone ever notice Holmes' grisly career choice? What will Prendergast do and what does he have to do with the fair?<br /><br /> In the format of chapters that roughly alternate, Larson exposes the characters of these individuals: the ambition and drive of Burnham, the amoral charm and bloodthirsty quest for psychological power of Holmes, and the obsessive insanity of Prendergast. While these stories are know to history, Larson is able to imbue them with suspense, showing the critical points at which the world's fair nearly failed and the many obstacles that continually arose to obstruct it, the care with which Holmes planned his career and chose his victims, and Prendergast's growing fascination with Chicago Mayor Carter Henry Harrison.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Larson begins several strands that lead nowhere. After Burnham's partner, John Root, dies, Larson hints that the opium addiction of Burnham's new partner, Charles Atwood, will cause problems later, but never alludes to it again.<br /><br /> Larson also spends a great deal of effort on everything that impedes Frederick Law Olmsted's implementation of the world's fair landscape architecture plan, from temporary infrastructure such as rails to paths rutted after heavy rains. Despite extensive quoting of Olmsted's concerns beyond the fair's opening, Larson never reveals whether Olmsted's plan was completed or, if not, the extent to which it was completed. At the end, while he describes Olmsted's decline into dementia in great detail, I found myself wondering what the results were of Olmsted's work on the world's fair and not finding even a hint of an answer.<br /><br /> Another area that Larson builds on is Chicago's desire to \\"out-Eiffel\\" Alexandre Gustave Eiffel and his Eiffel Tower. The result is the Ferris Wheel, which attracts thousands of visitors and makes $200,000 in profits. It's never clear, however, whether the contemporary world perceived that Burnham and Ferris had succeeded in their quest.<br /><br /> In his conclusion, Larson omits some interesting details and gets others wrong. He mentions that the Palace of Fine Arts was transformed into a permanent building, home to the Museum of Science and Industry, but fail to mention that it was designed by Burnham's opium-addicted partner, Charles Atwood. Indeed, Atwood is mentioned only twice. While noting that Olmsted's lagoons and Wooded Island survive in Jackson Park today, he doesn't allude to the other remnant of the fair that graces the park-a replica of the Statue of the Republic, fondly known as \\"Big Mary.\\" His portrayal of Wooded Island as a \\"wild and tangled place\\" is only partially accurate. At the request of area nature lovers, the Chicago Park District stopped managing some areas, which are becoming \\"wild and tangled.\\" Visitors who cross the bridge, however, first behold a mowed lawn, while the Japanese garden is carefully, planted, pruned, and maintained-a fact that would surprise readers who go by Larson's description. Larson also talks about Burnham's contribution's to Michigan Avenue, Chicago's \\"Miracle Mile.\\" The area is, of course, known more commonly as the \\"Magnificent Mile,\\" a phrase coined in 1947 by real estate developer Arthur Rubloff that is more suited to Burnham's lofty aspirations. (\\"Miracle Mile\\" appears to be a recent marketing invention that most likely refers to the miracle it would take not to spend any money at the avenue's many upscale shopsand restaurants.)<br /><br /> Larson captures the era of rapid change and how a new type of American criminal, the antisocial serial killer, could take advantage of the time's evolving mores and seeming indifference to mysterious disappearances. Burnham is incompletely portrayed; while he is shown to be a great architectural project manager who helped change the American idea of what a city could be, the reader is left with no sense of Burnham's own architectural vision and style. Louis Sullivan's criticism of the fair as relying on the past seems unfair based on Larson's version of the exposition was built; even had he wanted to be innovative, Burnham and his architects simply ran out of time. What would the exposition have looked like if Burnham had had another year?<br /><br /> Early visitors to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition felt a sense that the fair was incomplete, especially since the unfinished Ferris Wheel silently attested this impression. Careful readers will feel the same way about The Devil in the White City.<br /><br /> Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Lieutenant Hornblower, set in the early 1800s during the Napoleonic Wars, is the second book chronologically in the 11-part Horatio Hornblower series. Forester is a master of combining exciting plots, recognizable characters, realistic naval and period information, and interesting historical detail. As you read Lieutenant Hornblower, you will see how even modern science fiction television and films, from Star Trek to Star Wars, owe a debt to Forester's story-telling technique.<br />This time, Hornblower is seen from the perspective of a more senior lieutenant, Bush, as they serve aboard Renown. Bush, himself a decisive, strong, if unimaginative, leader, finds himself redefining and expanding his concepts of leadership and command as he observes Hornblower's interactions with his junior and senior officers. Hornblower subtly guides them to the actions and decisions that he wants from them without overstepping the top-down chain-of-command structure of the 1800s British navy, in which the captain enjoys the omnipotence granted by the king over crew and officers alike. Hornblower's approach even anticipates today's most current thinking about the nature of corporate leadership.<br />As a character, Hornblower can be too perfect. His suggestions and his actions are always on target and successful, and it is he who saves Renown and her mission time and again. Even when he makes a rare mistake, for example, overheating the shot so that it will no longer fit in the cannons, the error does not affect the outcome of the venture.<br />Forester tries to humanize Hornblower, whom Bush notices carefully hiding his emotions and frailties-even hunger and poverty-lest anyone perceive his weakness. Interestingly, Hornblower survives the paranoia of a mad captain, the indecisiveness and incompetence of an inept first lieutenant, harrowing sea and land battles with the Spanish, and delicate diplomatic maneuverings with the Spanish and with the highest levels of naval representatives, only to succumb to an unattractive but smitten woman.<br />Throughout the novel, there is one recurring question that Hornblower avoids answering. Bush asks it, as does Buckland, the lackluster first lieutenant. Depending on how you perceive the underlying situation-and what you believe the real answer to be-you could see it as a positive reflection on Hornblower's character, or a disturbing aspect of it. Forester deliberately raises this point repeatedly; it adds mystery and a human dimension to a character who could otherwise have become a stock hero, always correct and always victorious (at least in war and politics).<br />If you're like me and love sea adventure, Lieutenant Hornblower is a must-read. Forester is able to explain the workings of a sailing vessel and the machines of war without sounding overly technical, mechanical, or tedious. He portrays the harsh discipline of the British navy so well that you will understand why sailors rapidly disappeared when the press gang was spotted; there was little question of patriotism, only one of self-preservation. Forester also plants in the imagination the horrors of war, where even lieutenants can be cut in two by cannonballs or tormented by mad captains, where decks become slippery with the blood and guts and limbs of the fallen.<br />Lieutenant Hornblower is an exciting, fast-paced read that may convince you to investigate the rest of the series.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />Only 23 when she wrote The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers captures the restless energy of adolescence and the loneliness and isolation of those who choose not to fit into their world-Mick Kelly, an artistic teenager whose titles and graffiti reveal a darker side to her personality; Jake Blount, an itinerant socialist; Benedict Mady Copeland, a consumptive black physician; and Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Caf&eacute;. Linking this disparate group of outsiders is the ironically named John Singer, a man who cannot talk (or sing). They are drawn to him, as lonely people are to someone they believe will listen and understand. They never step out of themselves to discover that Singer listens, but he doesn't understand, nor do they realise that he, too, is lonely and isolated-or why.<br />Just as these four impose their concept of Singer upon him, he has his own idol-his companion of 10 years, Spiros Antonapoulos. While Singer's lonely friends project upon him the character of a wise, knowing, understanding man, Singer in turn imposes a similar personality on Antonapoulos. His life revolves around his rare visits to the asylum to which Antonapoulos is eventually taken. As the reader's awareness of Antonapoulos as a childish, greedy, and lazy man grows, so grows Singer's faith in him as gentle and wise. As a fellow mute, Antonapoulos is all Singer has, so he both idealises and idolises him-in the same way that Mick, Blount, Copeland, and, to a lesser extent, Brannon idealise and idolise Singer.<br />Rarely do any of the four interact, except when Blount and Dr. Copeland engage in a circular argument about how best to help their peoples-victims of capitalism in Blount's case, blacks in Dr. Copeland's. These two groups have much in common, but just as Blount and Dr. Copeland remain in bitter conflict, so do their peoples-a conflict which is alluded to throughout and which culminates in a brawl at the carnival grounds where Jake works. Dr. Copeland and Jake never find common ground, nor do the poor white laborers and oppressed blacks they wish to enlighten. Dr. Copeland's self-sacrificing but hopeless dedication and Jake's self-destructive brutality could be seen as representing their time and place, the 1930s South.<br />Sexual ambiguity pervades the novel. It is never clear whether Singer and Antonapoulos are lovers, although it seems like that that is what lies behind Singer's uncritical devotion. Even when Antonapoulos's selfish, greedy, irrational behaviour drives away a third mute, Singer is merely disappointed at the loss of a potential friend-as long as he has Antonapoulos, he is content. After Antonapoulos leaves, \\". . . in the spring a change came over Singer . . . his body was very restless . . . unable to work off a new feeling of energy.\\"<br />This sexual energy is shared by Mick, who is always restless. This isolates her even more from the rest of her family: her father, a disabled carpenter trying half-heartedly to make a living; her mother, for whom Mick acts as a substitute parent for her younger brothers Bubber (George) and Ralph; her older brother Bill, once close to her and now distant; and her older sisters Hazel and Etta, who have been forced from adolescence into adulthood through work and their own conventional interest in celebrity. (One could speculate about the nature of the \\"diseased ovary\\" Etta develops.)<br />Mick lives in an \\"inside room,\\" where she finds peace in music and in her perceptions of her friendship with Singer. Later, after her sexual initiation, she finds herself slyly manipulated into taking a job by her apparently solicitous family; at this point, she notices that, while the \\"inside room\\" is still important, she has less time and energy for it. McCullers exposition of Mick's transition from inventive childhood to dulling adulthood is subtle and is one of the best aspects of the novel.<br />Of the four, Brannon is the most enigmatic.

Not recommended.<br /><br />In The Book of the Courtesans, Susan Griffin tries to capture the magic that made courtesans some of the most noteworthy and notorious women of their times. According to Griffin, a courtesan would need to have several virtues to succeed, including: timing, beauty, cheek, brilliance, gaiety, grace, and charm. Mixed with these virtues are seven \\"erotic stations\\": flirtation, suggestion, arousal, seduction, rapture, satiety, and afterglow.<br /><br />Griffin uses biographies to illustrate how various courtesans exhibited these virtues, for example, courtesan and poet Veronica Franco's beginnings and career are covered under the chapter on \\"Brilliance.\\" Griffin, who earlier separated the concept of courtesan from those of mistress and prostitute, runs into trouble, for many of her plentiful examples do not fit her definition of courtesans. For example, she talks at great length about Mme. de Pompadour (mistress to Louis XV), Marion Davies (mistress to William Randolph Hearst), and \\"Klondike Kate\\" (gold rush saloon dancer). The point of naming these virtues is lost if a courtesan cannot be found who exemplified them.<br /><br />Griffin's information is untrustworthy. She states that Jeanne du Barry's father was a monk as though this is an accepted historical fact. Most biographical information on du Barry, however, states that her father is unknown but could have been a cleric. There are numerous instances of this kind of misleading information throughout. She talks of a suggestive sculpture in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay based upon a body cast of courtesan Apollonie Sabatier, but art sources say this story is unconfirmed and originated from a rumour circulated at the salon where the sculpture debuted. It is difficult to separate Griffin's blithe statements from the established facts.<br /><br />The author doesn't stop there, however. She engages in flights of fancy that sound poetic but have little basis in fact or reality. As a child, Mogador and her mother lived in fear of one of her mother's former lovers. She escaped him twice, and, according to Griffin, \\"the exhilaration of these two escapes must have livened her [dance] steps\\" later in life. How the terror of running from being beaten and brutalised as a child could lead to \\"exhilaration\\" while dancing is clear only to Griffin. She uses \\"exuberance\\" in a similar context.<br /><br />In addition, Griffin stretches metaphors past their limits, to the point where they are ludicrous rather than apt or poetic. For example, \\"even while destiny was robbing C&eacute;leste [Mogador] of any sense of safety, like the careening rise and fall of the polka, it also conspired to tempt her with something grander than simple security.\\" She says Marie Dorval \\"nearly asphyxiated herself for each performance,\\" which seems comparable to being a \\"little pregnant.\\" She states that, like the other poor people of Paris, Mogador saw the melodramatic events of her own life reflected [on stage]\\" and that \\"even today a pulse can be felt to vibrate back and forth between the stage and the audience.\\" What is lost here is that the members of today's audiences are unlikely ever to have been poor in the same sense as Mogador.<br /><br />Courtesans is replete with these kinds of disconnects. When discussing beauty, Griffin gives an example of a canyon, then claims that beauty \\"needs\\" to be enhanced-but fails to explain why or how one can enhance the natural beauty of a canyon. In other words, she demonstrates the opposite of her point-beauty does not need to be enhanced, and her concept of beauty is phony and ephemeral. She also says Blanche d'Antigny, at age 10, hid in the attic because of a \\"desperate longing\\" to stay in the \\"beautiful countryside.\\" The obvious never occurs to Griffin-that small children are rarely eager to leave the only stable home they have ever known, even an ugly one.<br /><br />Another leap of logic occurs later when Griffin says, \\"Many men would have been threatened by such potency in a lover.\\" Perhaps this is generally true, but Griffin seems oblivious to the fact that \\"many men\\" aren't Louis XV, king of France. His sense of security about du Barry's \\"potency\\" is hardly remarkable, since he is the primary source of it.<br /><br />Mostly, Griffin idealises the courtesan's career, and much of Courtesans seems to reflect her personal regret that this lifestyle opportunity belongs to history. She quotes Veronica Franco as writing, \\"You can do nothing worse in this life . . . than to force the body into such servitude . . . to give oneself in prey to so many, to risk being despoiled, robbed or killed . . . what fate could be worse?\\" Franco's advice is quite clear-except to Griffin, who says, \\"In fact, the impassioned tone of her letter does not contradict the passionate defense she made of courtesanry [where?], but instead outlines the perils courtesans faced . . .\\" \\"What fate could be worse?\\" than subjecting one's will and body completely to others seems a very specific condemnation of the lifestyle, but not to Griffin. We can't expect anything more of the author who peppers this \\"history\\" with page after page of fiction and who says, \\"But that is why fiction exists-so we may see the undocumented moments that would otherwise pass out of history, and thus out of our understanding, unwitnessed.\\" In other words, don't file The Book of the Courtesans under \\"History/Women's History,\\" as the cover suggests. Shelve it under \\"Susan Griffin's idealist imagination.\\" Better yet, consider reading a different book altogether. Grandes Horizontales by Virginia Rounding has been recommended as an alternative.<br /><br />As an aside, there is no index, which also detracts from any value this book may have had as a reference.<br /><br />Diane L.

The &quot;Brothers&quot; of the title are Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton (one vignette examines their famous duel), George Washington, Benjamin Franklin (who is skimmed over, partly because of his age and lack of highest-level participation in the new government and partly, one suspects, because Ellis openly holds him in low regard), James Madison, John (and Abigail) Adams, and Thomas Jefferson.<br />Ellis is a highly biased historian and, as a result, can be a sloppy one. He fares best with Hamilton and Burr, showing Hamilton's concerns about Burr's character at a crucial time when character mattered because so much was at stake.<br />Any attempt at objectivity ends with Hamilton and Burr, however. For Ellis, George Washington is the sole reason we are here today. While outlining his physical flaws, Ellis believes that Washington had a prescient idea of what the nation needed, including a strong leader like himself-a leader who could write to the Cherokee &quot;in this path I wish all the Indian nations to walk&quot; (referring to his advice to them to stop fighting white expansion and to adopt white economics and culture). Ellis avoids any reference to what would happen when many of the Cherokee did exactly what Washington told them to do-the infamous Trail of Tears. For all of Ellis's belief in Washington's prophetic abilities and insight, he deliberately leaves out that which does not fit with his view of history-the fact that the Indians, whether compliant Cherokee or defiant Comanche, were going to suffer similar fates, whether they took Washington's advice or not.<br />Later, when listing the Founding Brothers' individual faults, the worst Ellis can say of Washington is that he was not well read, did not write well, and was a poor speller. He also notes that Washington was more of an actor than a leader, failing to acknowledge that leadership is largely a matter of acting out the role and performing for the public.<br />Ellis is similarly protective of John Adams, whose presidency is remembered as a bad one because that is what Jefferson wanted. Ellis points out that Adams's best decision-to send a peace delegation to France-was made while Abigail was sick in Quincy, while his worst choices-support of the Alien and Sedition Acts-were made under her direct influence. When he says that Adams did well when all the votes were counted, despite &quot;bad luck, poor timing, and the highly focused political strategy of his Republican enemies,&quot; Ellis disingenuously blames circumstance, Abigail, and Jefferson for Adams's failings. Ellis can gloss over the evidence, but he cannot explain away Adams's personal choice to support bad legislation. He, not Abigail or Jefferson, was responsible for his own actions and his own presidency.<br />This is not the case with Jefferson's presidency. While it is barely mentioned (it merits part of a paragraph on page 212), Ellis says that Jefferson's first term &quot;would go down as one of the most brilliantly successful in American history.&quot; This passive statement implies that this success had nothing to do with Jefferson or his actions, but just happens to be how history had recorded it. Ellis hurries on to state that his second term &quot;proved to be a series of domestic tribulations and foreign policy failures.&quot; Ellis leaves the reader with the impression that Adams is not to blame for his mistakes and that Jefferson can take credit only for his failures.<br />While Ellis's view of Jefferson as a conniving, borderline psychotic may explain Jefferson's behavior and pattern of denial, it does so partly because Ellis contorts the evidenceto lead to his conclusion rather than letting the evidence lead him to the conclusion. At one point, he states that Adams must surely have seen an exchange of letters between Abigail and Jefferson and that &quot;we can be reasonably sure that Abigail was speaking for her husband as well as herself and goes on to elaborate that the &quot;Adams team&quot; was charging Jefferson with two serious offenses. One page later, Ellis contradicts himself when he says, &quot;Although Jefferson probably presumed that Abigail was sharing their correspondence with her husband, Adams himself never saw the letters until several months later.&quot; He quotes Adams as writing, &quot;The whole of the correspondence was begun and conducted without my Knowledge or Suspicion.&quot;<br />Later, Ellis reads Jefferson's mind, asserting that his use of the &quot;collective we&quot; in a letter was &quot;inadvertent acknowledgment of the coordinated campaign of the Republican party.&quot; How Ellis draws this conclusion is unclear; Jefferson uses &quot;we&quot; three times in the sentence. There is nothing &quot;inadvertent&quot; about Jefferson's statement; he is telling Adams outright the collective Republican leadership's perception of his role.<br />Ellis has come up with an interesting interpretation of Washington as indispensable; Jefferson as treacherous, traitorous, and seemingly disturbed; and Adams between the two-a fiery but decent man, hamstrung by Washington's aura and reputation and by Jefferson's disingenuous deviousness. Jefferson's version of history, which Ellis believes was consciously created, has won. The underlying problem is that, given the level of contortions, distortions, and outright mind reading it requires for Ellis to come to this point, his version of history is as suspect as that of the Thomas Jefferson he portrays.<br />If you want to learn about the aftermath of the American Revolution and the relationships of its leaders, read Founding Brothers-but read it critically and with an awareness that Ellis is guiding you not to where the evidence leads, but where he directs it to lead. It's interesting, entertaining, and thought provoking-but then so is historical fiction.

As Marian tells him, \\"That's why we need you. You're a pessimist and a good planner.\\" While McKinley states that she tried to be \\"historically unembarrassing,\\" on occasion language fails her, as when one character mentions what Robin is \\"going through,\\" as though they are stock characters in a daytime drama.<br />The Robin Hood Legend fascinates different people of different personalities, time periods, locations, and preferences for different reasons. For example, young boys may like the bravado of a fearless hero, while young girls may adore his courage and the romance implicit in the tale. Those who have felt oppressed (if only by an unlikable boss) may appreciate his initiative and his flouting of authority. To yet others, the outlaw band that steals from the rich and gives to the poor may serve as affirmation of justice in an unjust world. Others may simply enjoy the fantasy elements that many tales set in medieval times seem to have. For myself, I like the idea of an outdoor life, in the deep, truly untouched forest, away from the noise, crowding, stresses, and obligations of modern life.<br />That said, McKinley's Robin Hood is none of the above. He becomes an outlaw accidentally and outlaw leader and legend only through the persuasive skills and stubbornness of Marian and Much. Physically, he is average. He is a good fletcher, an average fighter, and a poor archer. While his followers (like the reader, drawn to a character who doesn't exist) boldly seek adventure and Norman purses, Robin is hesitant and fretful. He stays awake at night, watchful, worrying about practicalities such as feeding and sheltering the growing ban, ensuring their Greentree haven deep in the heart of Sherwood is protected, and seeing to it that there are enough privy holes dug for the group's needs. McKinley reduces Robin to what he really may have been at one time-a real human (or combination of humans) who, like a rock collects snow as it rolls downhill, has collected a variety of improbable elements as he passes through time. McKinley melts the snow until Robin could have been a real person-even if he was not. McKinley clearly feels this has appeal to modern sensibilities. She may be right, since this is a popular youth book. Perhaps, however, part of its popularity is due to the accessibility of its language to modern youth, for whom Pyle's work is stilted and awkward.<br />Unfortunately, McKinley manages to rush through her plot while making it drag. While she elaborates about why the Chief Forester hates Robin, which indirectly leads to his crime, McKinley provides no context for the Norman oppression of the Saxons; it suddenly appears as a reason for Robin to lead a band of outlaws, but is not supported other than through a few tales of high taxes and lost holdings. In other words, the reader feels the villainy of the Chief Forester, the sheriff, and other select Normans, but not the cruelty of the people as a whole-yet the outlaws are fixated upon it. The reader is never brought in emotionally. The sheriff's role is never defined; American readers will likely think he is simply a law enforcer rather than the king's administrator (shire-reeve). Although the sheriff \\"is a cruel and greedy fool and lout,\\" it is never clear who appointed him-the absent and negligent Richard Lionheart or the Regent, vaguely alluded to a few times. It's also not clear where Lionheart is-fighting the Saracens in Palestine or, as mentioned at one point, imprisoned in Germany.<br />Meanwhile, the plot plods along, with effort expended to build up a sense of danger around Marian relationship with Beatrix (a relation?) that falls flat and abruptly disappears. A gratuitous romance is introduced between members of the band for no apparent reason. Halfway through the novel, theperspective shifts inexplicably from that of Robin, Marian, and Much to that of Little John and Cecil-a shift necessary in one or two chapters to move the plot, but which detracts from the investment the reader has made in Robin and Marian.<br />One wonders how McKinley chose names for some of the lesser outlaws-are they hers, or do they come from previous retellings? While some (Rafe, Cecil) are English, others (Eva and Simon-Hebrew, Humphrey and Matilda-German, Marjorie-Greek, Sibyl (Cybill)-Latin, and the male Jocelin-French (female!) have non-English origins, which seems unlikely, nor have I encountered them in my medieval readings. Like the continual feminist approach, the names are so out of place that they detract from the sense of realism-as do the many wounds that never turn gangrenous and are well on their way to healing within a week.<br />Most of all, The Outlaws of Sherwood lacks suspense, perhaps because the plot is weak and disjointed. McKinley wastes opportunities, as with Marian and Beatrix as well as Robin's uncertainty about the unknown Cecil. When Robin commits a crime particularly embarrassing to the sheriff, that official finally shows interest. After a climactic battle with Guy of Gisbourne told in anticlimactic detail (even Tuck feels time is endless) and a tedious focus on the weeklong aftermath (during which the sheriff is mysteriously absent), The Outlaws of Sherwood finally drags to an anticlimactic end, with Lionheart droning about fealty, the king's whim, reward, and punishment and doling out judgments. Despite the attempt to make Robin realistic, he and Sherwood are even less alive and less vibrant than in the improbably legend.

Hanawalt. Not recommended.<br />University of Minnesota history professor Barbara Hanawalt uses an array of primary sources, from court cases and Hustings Wills to contemporary books of advice, to show how typical children grew up in London during the 14th and 15th centuries, from an abbreviated childhood to early marriages and lengthy apprenticeships. Between chapters full of facts taken from her sources, she interjects composite fictions, from a schoolboy's drowning to a case of marriage-related blackmail.<br />Hanawalt covers such topics as living conditions, sanitation, family and social networks, apprentice and servant contracts, relationships between apprentices and masters and servants and masters, orphans, wards, marriage, and birth. She also tries to define how an individual moved from one stage of life to another, with an apprentice or servant contract marking the transition from childhood to adolescence and the end of apprentice or a marriage marking the end of adolescence.<br />Although Hanawalt provides an excellent overview of how young people moved through life and the different expectations of males and females, there is little life in these pages beyond the facts, despite the fictional interjections (one of which turns the mythical &quot;Robin Hood&quot; into an urban blackmailer!). One comes away with a sense of a very ordered society, where citizens' orphans are under the protection of the city through the mayor and chancellor and the guilds regulate dress, behaviour, and other potential expressions of individuality. There is little detail, here, however, beyond the bare facts to show how children spent their days, how they felt about their parents and society, and what they aspired to. There is more about the contractual nature of apprenticeship and servanthood than about the day-to-day life of an apprentice, leaving the reader feeling that there are critical pieces missing about what &quot;growing up&quot; meant to the medieval mind. In many cases, Hanawalt will draw broad conclusions about how a particular situation might be treated based on only one or two records, although they may not be representative.<br />Hanawalt occasionally makes odd or even ludicrous statements or comments. For example, she says, &quot;Ratus ratus, a scientific name with a redundant ring&quot; unnecessarily, as this adds nothing of interest. Not only that, but the scientific name is Rattus rattus, and, although Hanawalt calls it the &quot;common house rat,&quot; it's more typically known as the black rat. On p. 42, she says, &quot;Growing up in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century London could not have been the same experience as growing up in more modern London.&quot; This statement is so laughably self-evident even to a non-historian, non-Londoner such as myself that one wonders what Hanawalt was thinking to include it. Later, she talks about &quot;pox, sweating sickness, flux . . .&quot; without defining what was meant by those terms. (Is &quot;sweating sickness&quot; a generic term for unspecified fevers, is it a specific fever, or is it something entirely different?) She asserts that &quot;females have a biological advantage in surviving disease&quot; but does not provide the basis for this claim or cite a source for it. (I am curious as to what this advantage is.)<br />Some of Hanawalt's examples do not seem related to the point. She says that &quot;a visit to a physician might have been more of a hazard than a help,&quot; then cites a case where &quot;the child was not cured.&quot; Logically, the supporting example should have illustrated how a physician's treatment actually harmed the patient. She notes that &quot;prostitutes, female servants, and singlewomen were at risk for conceiving illegitimate children.&quot; What is a &quot;singlewoman&quot;? Perhaps this term has a specific medieval meaning, but without a definition, it sounds like she is saying unmarried women were at risk of having illegitimate children. At one point, she notes that &quot;cases of forced prostitution of vulnerable young teenage girls can be multiplied in the record sources, but the repetition of such sad cases become depressing.&quot; Does the reader need to be told this? And, since Hanawalt declares in the introduction that she has &quot;a basic optimism about human nature that comes through,&quot; her viewpoint is admittedly skewed.<br />Undoubtedly, Hanawalt has done her research and made a contribution to our understanding of the workings of London law and society as they affected children and adolescents (however defined).

After all, given the clash of Native peoples with Europeans, Europeans with each other, a revolution and the founding of a republic, a bloody civil war, two world wars, the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, and hundreds of years of racial tensions, American history is inherently dramatic. Moreover, studies have shown that minority students who perform well in math, sciences, and other subjects consistently underperform in American history. By examining the contents of a dozen representative textbooks, Loewen discovers what's wrong with American history as taught-it truly is boring, bland, and, in many cases, consists of lies and half-truths. Almost worse, it is written in a simplistic, declarative style more evocative of grade-school primers than of the college-level works many high school students will soon face.<br />The simplest example Loewen offers is that of Helen Keller, whose touching story of overcoming disability becomes the entire story of her life, as most of us know it. Like Tom Sawyer, she is stuck in perpetual adolescence in our minds. The real Keller, however, grew up and became an outspoken advocate for the working class and the poor. In fact, she became a radical socialist. As a symbol, Keller is two dimensional, almost like a character in a moving TV movie. As a real person, Keller is also a whole person, sharing why she empathizes with the lower classes, showing courage in supporting the NAACP in the 1920s, and even revealing embarrassing lapses in judgment, like her gushing support of the Russian Revolution.<br />The example of Keller, paired with what the history textbooks leave out about Woodrow Wilson (his racism and imperialism, and, I would guess, his feud with progressives like Theodore Roosevelt) are minor compared to what follows. There's the &quot;discovery&quot; and &quot;exploration&quot; of America, with the pertinent question of a land settled for centuries can be either &quot;discovered&quot; or &quot;explored.&quot; There's also the largely ignored question of other possible forays into the &quot;new&quot; world by peoples ranging from Scandanavia to Africa. American history texts treat history as a sacred text and each explorer as an archetype, ignoring Columbus's avaricious and vicious behaviour toward the Arawaks. One explorer is portrayed overlooking his &quot;discovery&quot; while wearing full armor-when, in reality, he and his party had been left with nothing but rags.<br />Lies covers a great deal of territory, from Columbus to the whitewashing of even recent history, like the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. History texts make several egregious errors: They tell blatant untruths. They perpetuate popular myths (e.g., the first Thanksgiving). They lie by omission. They leave false impressions (e.g., the civil rights movement had no causal relationship to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965). They avoid negative images even from primary sources (e.g., the disgust Columbus's contemporaries felt about his treatment of the Indians). They fail to portray whole people (e.g., Lincoln and Douglas are carefully edited). They distort events and attitudes (e.g., Reconstruction). They avoid conflict and controversy at all costs. Fundamentally, they shun anything that would put history, people, and movements into context. They fail to make critical connections (like that between the civil rights movement and the Civil Rights Act). They therefore fail to do what intellectual inquiry should: engage students and require them to examine information and draw conclusions about its credibility and cause and effect. Instead, students memorise (badly) the archetypes and the myths built around them without thinking about their likelihood-or improbability. And, without being asked to engage themselves with the material or the people who make history, it's no wonder students can't remember anything and that they see history is irrelevant today.<br />How have history textbooks reached this point? The fault lies with everyone from absent and indifferent authors, publishers who need to sell books, interest groups, states that prefer myth to reality, review boards that their own agendas, and, of course, each of us who learned this myths and believes them as untouchable as A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Popular culture perpetuates them. Of course, there are the teachers who are overburdened with administrative and disciplinary tasks rather than teaching. Loewen also notes that, while math and sciences are generally taught by people with degrees in these areas, history is so low priority that it often falls to a coach, who must justify his or her sports role by holding a teaching position, whether they are qualified or not.<br />Loewen proposes a number of correctives. For example, he suggests teaching fewer topics. Is it necessary to memorise every European explorer who &quot;discovered&quot; something, or would it be more relevant to show the impact that Columbus's expeditions had, not only on the Americas, but on the cultures, economies, and futures of Europe, Africa, and the Islamic world? Rather than regurgitating facts, students can learn the skills of criticism-how to examine the credibility of primary and secondary sources based on the writer or speaker's viewpoint and agenda and how to put information into its broader context.<br />History as it happened is why we are where we are today. Rather than distort it into &quot;feel-good&quot; nationalism, we need to learn what it has to teach us to engage with it. I recommend this to anyone with a serious interest in American history and in the current sad state of American history education.<br />Diane L.

US	52876068	R1ZYVFQ587CUS3	0452264464	675572194	Beloved (Plume Contemporary Fiction)	Books	5	12	15	N	N	One of the great novels of the 20th century	Beloved by Toni Morrison. Highly recommended.<br />In 275 gripping and unsettling pages, Toni Morrison encapsulates the late 19th century black experience through the story of Sweet Home, a small Kentucky farm, and one of its former slaves, Sethe, who has found an uneasy freedom north of an arbitrary line that does not exist on any natural map.<br />To empathize the universality of experience, Sethe's mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, notes wryly, &quot;Not a house in the country ain't packed to its rafters with some dead Negro's grief.&quot; Later, Beloved, living in freedom in Ohio, will experience vivid ancestral memories aboard a slave ship-the memories of generations before her. These are contrasted to Sethe's &quot;terrible memory,&quot; where she recalls the beauty of the sycamores better than the dead men hanging from them. This may explain the persistence of the dead baby's ghost haunting Sethe's house at 124 Bluestone Road-the need to remind Sethe of everything she cannot forget.<br />From the forced bestiality of the Sweet Home men to Sethe's anguish about how teacher's nephews stole her milk as though she were a cow, the theme of animals prevails throughout Beloved. Later, it is revealed that Sethe experienced an epiphany when she discovers teacher and nephews dividing her on paper into human and animal traits.<br />Her companion, Paul D, has witnessed the difference between an animal and himself. Once imprisoned underground, once forced to wear a bit like a horse, Paul D walks past a rooster whose egg he had helped break open during hatching. &quot;Mister, he looked so . . . free . . . Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. But wasn't allowed to be and stay what I was . . . wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D again, living or dead . . . I was something else and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.&quot;<br />Ultimately, Beloved is revisionist history that makes the connection between racism and slavery-a connection that often seems missing from the whitewashed history we are taught. The Sweet Home farm represents this version of history. The male slaves are encouraged to think of themselves as men and are even allowed to carry guns, while Sethe is permitted her choice of partners and to keep her children. In this version of history, no one is beaten or restrained. Sweet Home's slaves, while not free, represent what we like to think-that slaves were well treated, that families were allowed to stay intact, and that somehow, antithetical to our declared values, black slaves in the United States were better off than free blacks in &quot;primitive&quot; Africa.<br />While Alex Haley's genealogical epic Roots dramatically depicted the reality of slavery-the brutal amputation of runaway Kunta Kinte's foot, his beatings, the rape of slaves by white masters-Morrison takes a different approach. The reader learns the story of Sweet Home-both before and after teacher arrives-through the gradual unfurling of Sethe and Paul D's &quot;rememories,&quot; both thought and spoken. In other words, in Beloved the former slaves aren't just shown and depicted; they speak for themselves and they tell their own version of slavery directly. The advent of teacher (a symbol of education and civilisation) marks the transition from the relative idyll of Sweet Home to slavery as practiced, where Sethe is brutalised, her husband is reduced to shock, Sixo is hunted down like an animal and killed for asserting his manhood through song (which may explain Paul D's singing by the time he and Sethe find each other again), and any sense of rights or autonomy is proved to be an illusion. It's not necessary to witness Sethe being beaten for telling her mistress how her milk was stolen; the branching tree on her back will tell the story for the rest of her life.<br />Sweet Home under teacher is slavery as it was, where slave owners who behave like animals convince themselves that it is the slaves who are part human, part animal, and where slavery is motivated by racism. Throughout, there is Beloved, rightly perceived by Denver as &quot;more,&quot; who is sacrificed to be spared what everyone knows, &quot;that anybody white could take your whole self for anything that came to mind. Dirty you so bad you couldn't like yourself any  more. Dirty you so bad you forgot who you were and couldn't think it up.&quot; Through her action, Sethe deprives Beloved of her own choices, thus enslaving her. And so Beloved returns to deny Sethe her own will.<br />Morrison may be accused of racism, but there is no feasible way to deny her characters their feelings after what they have heard, witnessed, and experienced. They cannot feel otherwise. Characters like Amy, the uneducated (unlike teacher) &quot;whitegirl&quot; who helps Sethe deliver Denver, and the sheriff who is kind toward Sethe despite her action, prove that there can be humanity among even a people who may seem otherwise inhumane.<br />Beloved is beautifully written and structured, poetic in tone, and compelling to read. It is also timeless and will most likely stand as one of the great novels of the 20th century.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 22 February 2004.l, and where slavery is motivated by racism.

In August, the Amistad and the Africans were seized off Long Island. These events set off a judicial, legislative, and diplomatic battle that would not be completely resolved until the Civil War ended slavery in the United States. Mutiny on the Amistad looks at the laws, issues, and people involved in this landmark case.<br />The key questions are: Who has jurisdiction over the case? Are the Africans legally slaves? If so, who has the rights to them? Are they \\"salvage,\\" like the Amistad?  Will the case worsen the relations with Spain and strengthen Great Britain's claims in Cuba? Will it become the catalyst the abolitionists need to give them and their cause credibility with the northern public? And how will Martin Van Buren's administration deal with such a controversial case in a re-election year?<br />While the case attracted the attention of abolitionists like Arthur and Lewis Tappan and John Quincy Adams; the administration of Martin Van Buren and even those of some of his successors; and several governments, including those of Spain and Great Britain, Jones's repetitive treatment of the story robs it of much of its drama. For example, he makes the declarative statement that the Van Buren administration's focus was solely on re-election and ensuring the Amistad case did not interfere with that objective more than a dozen times. Some of the primary source quotes do not seem well selected to expand upon the contemporary view; in too many cases, quotes consist of one or two words, such as \\"gross injustice,\\" that are too out of context or are such common expressions that they become meaningless. The best quotes come, not from the case or the participants, but from the various southern, northern, and abolitionist publications; these headlines reveal contemporary perceptions, beliefs, and biases. As for the participants, the only voice that seems to express any passion is that of John Quincy Adams, who is clearly emotional about the abolitionist cause.<br />In the meantime, the voices of Joseph Cinqu&eacute; and the rest of the Africans-the subjects of the entire controversy-are heard only rarely, primarily through letters to the abolitionists complaining about the poor conditions they are subjected to in prison. It is not clear if this is because their testimony was generally deemed irrelevant (they seldom speak for themselves) or if their feelings and thoughts are poorly documented because of the language and literacy barriers they initially face. Jones does try to interject them periodically, but during the long passages in which they are missing the reader feels as though the case has become an exercise in legal argument without victims.<br />Ultimately, it is not clear what the Amistad case accomplished. For many in the north, Cinqu&eacute; and the other Africans are objects of both curiosity and sympathy, but it is not apparent that the Amistad case significantly advanced the cause of abolition-in itself an irony since Cinqu&eacute; and company were never legally slaves (one point that the courts and even the district attorney agree upon). Jones asserts that the case raised public awareness of the conflict between natural law (such as man's right to freedom and to kill to obtain it) and positive law (such as that enabling slavery and preventing slaves from rebelling). The scope of Jones's research and quotations, save those from newspapers, does not support this; there is little presented to show that the case was discussed every day in ballrooms, parlors, and bars or that the general public's perception was permanently altered. What is clear, however, is the racism that is prevalent throughout. Even some of theabolitionists, most of whom are spiritual leaders who find slavery an abomination against God, do not consider Africans their equals.<br />The facts of the case are all here, along with much of the background. Some of the conclusions seem incomplete. Throughout, one gets the impression this could have been a shorter, more succinct, and, more importantly, a more dramatic and tightly argued book had Jones or his editor cut the repetitions, redundancies, and minutiae and focused on a more cohesive discussion of the relevant specifics of the case and its effects on the public, the U.S. government, and policy. As it is, in Jones's hands this case appears less interesting and less important historically than it probably was, and even the source of all this, Cinqu&eacute; and his comrades, lose their three-dimensionality-their humanity, as it were. If you are interested in the Amistad case and in the story of the abolitionist movement, this is probably a must-read-but don't stop here.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br /><br />Explaining Hitler is a misleading title, for the focus is primarily on the Jewish academic community's attempts to explain Hitler-to put it in grossly oversimplified terms, this is somewhat like the prey explaining the motivations of the predator. The result is that, while Hitler remains a mystery, the academic and personal biases of the explainers are revealed. To each person's theories and comments Rosenbaum adds his own analysis, finding the flaws with precision.<br /><br />Hitler explanation ranges from the deeply personal (abusive father, infection by a Jewish prostitute, mother's painful death under the care of a Jewish physician) to the inevitable influence of historical forces (post-war inflation, depression). Rosenbaum discusses the personal in depth, including Hitler's rumored Jewish ancestor and bizarre relationship with his half-niece Geli Raubal, the convolutions each theory takes, and the lack of facts or reliable information to support any of them. For example, Rosenbaum astutely points out the only real \\"proof\\" of the abusive father is Hitler's own assertion and sarcastically suggests that there is reason not to trust Hitler's word. One argument that immediately comes to mind that Rosenbaum only briefly alludes to later is that millions of people have abusive fathers, bad experiences with individual members of ethnic and other groups, and so forth, yet do not turn into war criminals responsible for the deaths of millions. In short, these theories might explain Hitler's anti-Semitism, but not the results.<br /><br />What is disturbing about so many of these explanations (some of which are advocated by such noted people as Simon Wiesenthal, who favors the Jewish prostitute theory), and more sophisticated ones that appear later in the book, such as George Steiner's, is their insistence that a Jew or a group of Jews is responsible. In these theories, a Jewish ancestor, a Jewish prostitute, an Eastern Jew with a different appearance, or the Jewish \\"blackmail of transcendence\\" and \\"addiction to the ideal\\" is responsible for Hitler-implying Hitler is not responsible at all. Although the egotistical and monomaniacal Claude Lanzmann, maker of the documentary Shoah, is too self-centered and angry to clearly articulate the basis for his belief that Hitler explanation is inherently \\"obscene,\\" it could be because so much \\"explanation\\" has found a way to point a finger at the Jews, directly or indirectly, while minimizing Hitler. Perhaps for that reason, Lanzmann is interested only in how the Holocaust was accomplished, not with the motivations of Hitler or his followers. The major flaw is that Lanzmann has missed the point by dictating that his rule of \\"There is no why\\" must apply to all other individuals-and the irony of that.<br /><br />As Rosenbaum repeatedly points out, no explanations for Hitler are acceptable that excuse him-that look to a bad experience with a Jew rather than to, for example, the influence of anti-Semitism surrounding him in Austria and Germany. Again, however, it can be said that anti-Semitic influence has surrounded many people (as Rosenbaum notes, pre-war France was more anti-Semitic than either Austria or Germany) who have not killed, let alone killed millions.<br /><br />Rosenbaum's approach is excellent, pairing individuals with complementary or opposing viewpoints, e.g., Lanzmann and Dr. Micheels, the theologian Emil Fackenheim and the atheist historian Yehuda Bauer in \\"The Temptation to Blame God.\\" Even revisionist David Irving is given a chapter. Rosenbaum saves what seems to be his preference for the last chapter-Lucy Dawidowicz's belief that Hitler decided on The Final Solution as early as 1918, based on what he said and did not say over time, and on the \\"laughter\\" that is transferred from the Jewish victims to the Nazi victors. While this does not explain the origins of Hitler's evil, it pinpoints the time frame and removes the notion that he was ambivalent or experienced a sense of moral ambiguity. Dawidowicz's Hitler knows early on what he wants to do and lets insiders in on the \\"joke\\" he finds it to be. Presented in this way, Dawidowicz does seem to have come closest to the truth about Hitler. After all, how can one capable of ambivalence ultimately kill millions?<br /><br />To me, one critical question is not why or how any one man became evil or chose an evil course of action, for the explanation could simply be that the capacity for evil in an individual may be higher than most of us are capable of realising or accepting. That is, everyday evil like John Wayne Gacy's is accomplished in isolation and is therefore limited in scope. The intent and the desired scope given opportunity remain unknowns. The more frightening question is why and how so many chose to follow Hitler. I do not necessarily mean the German people, per se, but the thousands of bureaucrats, managers, and soldiers who physically carried out The Final Solution, knowing exactly what this entailed and what it signified. Hitler seized the opportunity offered by the political and social situation to institutionalize his personal evil. A single man may envision and desire genocide, but it takes followers and believers to carry it out. Explaining Hitler (or Stalin or Genghis Khan) is not enough to explain the scope of this particular human evil. Without followers, there are no leaders. And without followers, millions of Jews (and Cambodians and Indians and so forth) could not have died.

Recommended.<br />Originally self-published, The Woman Who Lives in the Earth is the type of work that likely would not have been published otherwise, as it is odd and lacks in popular or market appeal. The setting is a drought-stricken world (pre- or post-Apocalyptic Earth?) inhabited by people whose minds have dried up and cracked along with the land on which they live. The smaller the collective mind of Henrytown, the longer the drought lasts.<br />Outside the town, uninfluenced but not untouched by its poisons, live a farm family: Aesa, Ada, and their daughter Sarah, soon joined by great-grandmother Lilly, ironically driven from her own home elsewhere by flooding. Even as their well is dying, they hold out hope that the world will right itself and that balance will be restored.<br />The town is represented by the hairless Lizard Woman, whose McCarthyesque role is to seek evil and explanation in others. She is assisted in her pursuit by Kreel (authority), Greyling Eyes (terror), and Henkel (documentation). To these shriveled people, it must be the different that is causing the drought-the girl, Sarah, who saves a fox from the cruelty of the town children (appearing to bring it back to life, surely an act of evil!).<br />Sarah, who has been endowed with intelligence, imagination, and sensitivity by her great-grandmother Lilly, becomes the focus of fear for the townspeople and, unknown to them, their source of hope. She meets what appears to be a fox, Marishan Borisan, whose questions and riddles guide Sarah toward insight about the self and who enables her to experience the existence of other things-and gain empathy with them. The fox prepares her for her role. When Lizard Woman and the Triumvirate overhear Sarah describing the fox's riddle about an egg to Lilly, they hear it as something completely different:<br />One part was fed with a spoon<br />One part was filled with fear<br />And the last was blind and . . . had . . . no . . . mind.<br />The Woman Who Lives in the Earth is a fable of those who reach out in fear and those who look within and then reach out in curiosity and hope. Without the latter, the former would dry and die or immolate themselves. Although Sarah is a child, this is not a children's story; the consequences for those who come to deny her as evil and to accept her for the child she is are quick, harsh, and irrevocable. The Woman Who Lives in the Earth is a mystical, magical illustration of Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous inaugural quotation, &quot;. . . the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,&quot; for &quot;the weaver who lives in my soul weaves a story that is hidden beneath all your thoughts and dreams.&quot; This is an alien tale whose fantastic elements may in time seem all too real.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />I was unaware that Edith Wharton, known for such insightful novels as The Age of Innocence, The House of Mirth, and Ethan Frome (as well as the popular movies these novels inspired), had indulged in writing ghost stories other than &quot;Afterward&quot; until I found this collection. In Ghost Stories, Wharton reveals her mastery of the psychology of horror-where ghosts terrify through their oblique influence on the human mind and emotion-and where these human foibles create their own horrors.<br />Wharton's ghosts take many forms-from the loyal retainer in &quot;The Lady's Maid's Bell&quot; to the loyal retainers of a different sort in &quot;Kerfol&quot;; from the guilt behind &quot;The Eyes&quot; to the guilt recognised &quot;Afterward&quot;; from the mysterious &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; to the ghostly and ghastly &quot;Miss Mary Pask.&quot; Some of these visitations are not seen, or, in the case of &quot;Kerfol,&quot; even heard. They fulfill various functions: To protect the secrets of the past, to bring the secrets of the past to light, to warn the present about the future, and to remind the living of the dead.<br />Like the best ghost story writers, Wharton begins each tale with a scenario that seems ordinary enough. Early on, she drops subtle clues that build from a feeling that something is somewhat amiss up to a sense of fractured reality that shatters one's assumptions. Wharton masterfully creates ironic twists (&quot;Miss Mary Pask&quot;), innocent victims (the wife in &quot;Afterward&quot;), and nontraditional ghosts (&quot;The Eyes,&quot; &quot;Kerfol&quot;). In many cases, the reader is one step ahead of the narrator or protagonist (Hitchcock's definition of suspense), creating a delicious sense of inevitable, unavoidable doom.<br />If you are looking for the gore and thrills of today's tale of horror, you will not find them in Wharton's work. If, on the other hand, you appreciate the subtle, growing sense of terror that M. R. James insinuates into The Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, you'll discover the same feeling of the fine line between this world and another that can manifest itself at any time and in any way when the need arises. These are stories to be read, savored, and read again-alone, of course.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 28 December 2003.ing sense of terror that M. R.

The Gies use a number of primary and secondary sources, the latter of which reveal how the historian's view of the medieval village has changed in the 20th and 21st centuries and how flexible historians must be in interpreting the evidence.<br />Researched and written for the layperson, Life in a Medieval Village is more accurately about life in an English medieval village, with most of the detail coming from the records of Aethelintone/Aethelington/Adelintune/Aylington (Elton) in Huntingdon, one of Ramsey Abbey's manors. The Gies provide a history of the village concept and its definition; its role in the manorial system (contrasted to the seigneurial system); a description of its people, physical structure, buildings, administration and administrators, judicial system, family and spiritual life, and work; and the background behind its decline.<br />The world of Elton and similar villages is not found in movies or novels. Social and economic statuses are not always clear cut, economic upward mobility is possible primarily through acquisition of land, and even the distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;unfree&quot; is not distinct. Life revolves around the manor and the villeins' and cotters' obligations to the mostly absent lord and the manor, which come in the form of work, rents, fees, taxes, and fines. The administrative structure of the manor is somewhat like that of a modern corporation, with the lord as CEO of multiple manors (and primary consumer of goods) who &quot;wanted the certainty of rents and dues from his tenants, the efficient operation of his demesne, and good prices for wool and grain.&quot; His steward, or seneschal, serves as senior executive, while the bailiff, reeve, beadle, woodward, and others are the manor's day-to-day managers and supervisors.<br />As the villagers acquire surnames (from where they live, what they do, the offices they hold, and personal characteristics), patterns emerge from the records. Some families become dominant economically and politically (e.g., holding many offices such as reeve or juror many times); others decline; while yet others show a propensity for violence and petty crimes. Such infractions are punished primarily with fines rather than corporal punishment; the stocks and hanging are resorted to only in the most egregious cases. The judicial system is often compassionate (or at least practical); many fines for minor trespasses are lowered or forgiven by the court because &quot;she is poor.&quot; When laws are broken, a jury hears the case, but the entire village decides.<br />The Gies also provide an excellent overview of the passing of the medieval village, which began with a sustained famine and the Black Death. The labor-intensive manorial system simply could not survive the depletion of workers, the increase in expenses, the onerous taxes brought on by wars, and, perhaps more importantly, the sense of change and discontent that began to pervade the villein class.<br />The challenge for the Gies as authors is to take the minimal material available (ranging from books about estate management written for lords and stewards to court and ecclesiastical records) and to bring the village to life from these records. What emerges are people who live in fragile houses; are rarely well fed from a nutritional perspective and whose food supply is always in doubt; work hard and are not above trying to wheedle out of work; who drink and fight and are sometimes brutal; fornicate (primarily a woman's crime but not a particularly reviled one); vandalize; commit petty crimes against the lord and their neighbors; and in short live lives of struggle every day without the expectation or vision of change in the future.<br />The Gies focus on Elton, with supplemental material from other English villages, so the reader who is interested in village life on the continent will need to explore other works to flesh out the picture. Because the mostly illiterate villagers themselves left few personal records, it is up to the thoughtful reader to discern the village's character and personality and to conceive of what day-to-day life must have been, based on the little that is known-to put oneself into the worn shoes of the working villein and to imagine his or her thoughts, feelings, and aspirations.

US	52876068	R2JJOO0U0LH1NW	0394555090	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Power and charm	Theodore Rex by Edmund Morris. Highly recommended.<br />Theodore Rex (from the dubbing given Theodore Roosevelt by author Henry James) is the second part of a trilogy-in-progress by Edmund Morris but is easily read on its own as coverage of Roosevelt's presidential terms. This installment covers Roosevelt's life from the day of McKinley's assassination and his swearing-in to seven years, one hundred sixty-nine days later, when he departs Washington, D.C., by train and \\"did not show himself [at Baltimore], as if to emphasize to a small, wistful crowd that he was no longer public property.\\"<br />Roosevelt's partial and whole terms are set during a time of unsettling transition-rapid developments in military technologies and abilities, influx of immigrants from Slavs to Japanese, growing global trade and interdependencies, spreading racial violence, uncontrolled combinations and trusts and corporate greed, and an increased awareness of the mismanagement of and need to conserve natural resources. In Theodore Rex, reflecting the logistics of Congress and the waning powers of a president not returning to office, the shorter first term covers more pages than the full second term.<br />During his presidency, Roosevelt adds the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, begins the Panama Canal after nudging Panamanian independence, supports the liberation of Cuba, resolves a Moroccan crisis, prevents a German-Venezuelan war and all that would imply, settles the Russo-Japanese conflict and wins the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, balances capital (much to its chagrin) and labor, rebuilds the U.S. Navy and solidifies the U.S. as a world diplomatic and military leader, and preserves an unprecedented amount of land (including five national parks, thirteen national forests, and fifteen national monuments-the Grand Canyon and Muir Woods among them).<br />Morris shows, through personal and family writings, the letters of friends and enemies, speeches, newspaper accounts, commentary (especially that of \\"Mr. Dooley\\"-Finley Peter Dunne), and other contemporary sources Roosevelt's intelligence, erudition, strength of will, personal conviction of righteousness, foresight, and uncanny ability to manipulate everyone from the media to senators and diplomats. He is a man who knows what he wants, that what he wants is right, and how to make what he wants happen. His determination and conviction lead to greatly expanded executive power-which in his mind is not incompatible or inconsistent with democracy. He has his weaknesses, too-most notably, an utter lack of understanding of business, finance, and the markets.<br />Although Roosevelt achieves much that directly benefits the public (such as settling the United Mine Workers strike and passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906) and earns popular support bordering on adulation, neither he nor his wisdom is perfect. Morris darkly hints that Roosevelt's enemies may have found their privacy compromised, for examples, senators who find their correspondence has already been opened by the Secret Service, although he later casts doubt on Roosevelt's involvement. More importantly, he discusses the Brownsville (Texas) incident at length, which reveals what can happen when democracy is subverted and power is abused. Roosevelt orders three entire companies of black soldiers-including at least one career soldier with whom he had served in Cuba-dishonorably discharged and banned from the military for life based on an incident that may have been fabricated by resentful white townspeople. Morris writes, \\"Brownsville had been proof to many, and perhaps even a warning to himself, of the truth of Lord Acton's famous dictum.\\"<br />Morris succeeds in bringing not only Theodore Roosevelt and his compelling personality to life, but those of many others as well: wife Edith Kermit Roosevelt; daughter Alice; son Quentin; House Speaker Joseph Cannon; United Mine Workers president John Mitchell; Cabinet members such as John Hay, Philander Chase Knox, Elihu Root, and George Cortelyou; long-time nemesis Mark Hanna; successor William Howard Taft (\\"who must have been a very pink and white baby,\\" according to Kate Carew); and confidantes such as Captain Archie Butt.<br />Theodore Rex is not limited to political life, however. Roosevelt is portrayed not only as a writer, reader, hunter/sportsman, adventurer, hiker, swimmer, and athlete. He is shown as a difficult father to Alice (who resents his silence about her own mother, the late Alice Hathaway Roosevelt), didactic disciplinarian to Quentin (along with his \\"White House Gang\\" of friends), and favourite uncle to broods of Roosevelt clan children at his Sagamore Hill summer retreat in Oyster Bay, New York. Even in his family relations, however, Roosevelt is always mindful of his image and that of his progressive platform, hence, his \\"posterity letters\\"-seemingly personal letters to family and friends, often signed with his full name, he uses to document his viewpoints for posterity.<br />Morris is clearly passionate about Roosevelt, and it shows in the life he brings to events that are more than one hundred years old. Whether you are interested in American history, the U.S. presidency and its holders, turn-of-the-century events, or Theodore Roosevelt himself, Theodore Rex is not to be missed for its honest portrayal of a complex man in changing times and for the light it throws on today's political climate and workings.

Highly recommended.<br />Miss Lonelyhearts, set on the East Coast in New York City, and The Day of the Locust, set on the West Coast in Hollywood, are the two grim but brilliant gems of Nathanael West's too-brief writing career.<br />In Miss Lonelyhearts, the title character-who has no other name to either the reader or the book's characters-is an advice columnist subsumed by the countless letters of despair he reads every day. His editor is named Shrike, appropriately, for the species of bird that impale their victims on thorns. While he seeks escape from \\"Desperate, Broken-hearted, Sick-of-it-all, Disillusioned-with-tubercular-husband\\": in the idealism of Religion, Art, Sex, and Nature, Shrike is always there to puncture his every attempt.<br />Miss Lonelyhearts' trouble precedes his career, however. During his college years, he tries to participate in a ritual sacrifice of a symbolic lamb (Religion) that is transformed into a cruel butchery and finally into a mercy killing. Later, Miss Lonelyhearts returns again and again to the image and idea of Christ, \\"the answer,\\" whose figure he has removed from its cross and nailed to the wall at the foot of his bed (taking over the sacrifice from Romans and history and making it his own).<br />For sex, he tries (unsuccessfully) to subdue the \\"virginity\\" of Shrike's wife (named Mary); takes on the offering of \\"an admirer,\\" Fay Doyle, \\"unhappily married [sacrificed] to a cripple\\"; and finally sacrifices the real virginity of Betty, whose order and sureness were \\"based on the power to limit experience arbitrarily.\\" Until she encounters him, she is not a candidate for a Miss Lonelyhearts column, but he and his \\"sickness\\" make her likely to become one. Throughout, Shrike is there to tell him, \\"Soul of Miss L., glorify me. Body of Miss L., save me . . .\\" In the end, Miss Lonelyhearts finds humility and calls on Christ, not in his illness, \\"but in the shape of his joy.\\" When he is happy \\"and the rock had been thoroughly tested and been found perfect,\\" when he gives up his humanity for Christ-like beatitude and detachment, he sacrifices himself.<br />In The Day of the Locust, set designer Tod Hackett has entered the world of Hollywood, where nothing is real, where even everyday clothes consist of personality-altering costumes (\\"the man in the Norfolk jacket and Tyrolean hat was returning, not from a mountain, but an insurance office\\"). Here, the slopes of the canyon are lined with \\"Mexican ranch houses, Samoan huts, Mediterranean villas, Egyptian and Japanese temples, Swiss chalets, Tudor cottages, and every possible combination of these styles.\\" Two types of people populate this set: the \\"masquerades\\" and those who \\"had come to California to die,\\" whose \\"eyes filled with hatred.\\"<br />Tod himself leads an unreal life as an unwanted extra in the love life of Faye [fairy-unreal] Greener, daughter of Harry Greener, who manages to make his own death seem no more than an act-and not always a good one.<br />After Harry's death, Tod and Faye's lives connect through two men who can be considered \\"masquerades\\": Earl the cowboy with his two-dimensional face and Miguel the Mexican, as well as Homer Simpson, a man who thinks he has come to California to recover his health and who doesn't realise he has come here to die.<br />Faye teases Earl, lusts after Miguel, and holds Tod at bay while living with Homer in a nonsexual business arrangement designed to keep her clothed, fed, and living well until she gets her big acting break, which, like all else in Hollywood, is an act and an illusion).<br />As Homer falls for Faye, she resents both his simplicity and his sincerity. Only when Homer finds her with Miguel (after mistaking her moaning for sickness) does he realise the truth of what Tod has told him: \\"She's a whore!\\" Like the Hollywood she wants to be part of, she is empty and bored-an illusion that cannot last. Even when Earl fights Miguelover her, the conflict is less real than that between two of Miguel's cocks, during which the weaker bird dies a harrowing, bloody, and genuine death that evokes compassion and sympathy than Harry's final act.<br />Throughout, Tod sees the masses finally turning to apocalyptic violence, which he portrays in his painting-in-progress, \\"The Burning of Los Angeles.\\" Faye, naked and smiling, chased by the mob, is a bird released and in flight.<br />The violence comes, however, when a nearly catatonic Homer attempts to leave this never-never land and to return to Wayneville, Iowa, on a night when the crowd has gathered for a movie premiere. Finding himself under attack by a bored neighbor child, he finally strikes back in a murderous rage, giving the crowd the impetus it seeks.<br />It is not \\"The Burning of Los Angeles,\\" but rather a fusion of Art, Sex, Religion, and Violence. Here, West returns to Miss Lonelyhearts and the attempted ideals of Art, Sex, and Religion ending in violence; he says of the womb: \\"Better by far than Religion or Art or the South Sea Islands\\"-an exact parallel to the idealist scenarios Shrike creates for Miss Lonelyhearts, only to puncture them with the fury of his cold, emotional violence.<br />Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust are short, beautifully crafted masterpieces in which nothing is wasted. West captures Hollywood perfectly, where, in 1939, there were already New Age cults like that of the \\"raw-foodists\\": \\"We eat only raw [vegetables]. Death comes from eating dead things.\\" In today's world, where millions turn to the Dear Abby columns and to Oprah, and where the cult of the celebrity is built on movies featuring easy sex and special-effects violence, Nathanael West might feel right at home-in time and place.<br />Diane L.

Davidson and Ada Norris. Highly recommended.<br />Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Simmons Bonnin), a South Dakota Sioux (through her mother; her father was white) born in 1876, the year of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, was an educator, musician, writer, and activist. She served as the secretary and treasurer of the Society of American Indians (SAI) and as editor of SAI's American Indian Magazine.<br />This collection of Zitkala-Sa's work includes background information about the author; a chronology of contemporary events; selections from &quot;Old Indian Legends&quot; (retellings of oral story traditions); &quot;American Indian Stories&quot;; selections from American Indian Magazine; and some of her poetry, pamphlets, essays, and speeches.<br />&quot;Old Indian Legends&quot; introduces Sioux traditions, including Iktomi (a trickster who often takes the form of a spider), Iya the glutton (able to consume whole villages), and the characters of the Sioux world-coyotes, ducks, the terrifying Red Eagle and the stranger who slays it, turtles, toads, mice, bears, badgers, and more. While at first these traditions and stories may strike the outsider as different and alien, to some extent they can evoke some European fairy tale traditions (which also may seem alien to modern sensibilities). Some of the most charming, like &quot;Dance in a Buffalo Skull,&quot; are written in human terms but have no human characters. &quot;Dance,&quot; with its &quot;two balls of fire&quot; growing &quot;larger and brighter&quot; and building of suspense, is an excellent short horror story as well.<br />The editors note that Zitkala-Sa &quot;makes significant changes to the traditional tales in order to address key political and social issues . . . specifically, land infringement, challenges to tribal sovereignty, and the effects of missionary boarding schools on Yankton or Sioux culture more generally.&quot; Careful in her use of her second language, English, Zitkala-Sa makes a telling transposition in her preface to &quot;Old Indian Legends&quot;; the Indian is the &quot;little black-haired aborigine,&quot; while the European-American is the &quot;blue-eyed little patriot.&quot; Can the people who subjugate and destroy the original natives of the land be anything more than &quot;little&quot; patriots? How great can their patriotism be? The answer is implicit, but Zitkala-Sa believed the old Indian legends belong as much to him simply because of &quot;our near kinship with the rest of humanity&quot; and because &quot;After all, he [the Indian] seems at heart much like other peoples.&quot;<br />Several of &quot;American Indian Stories&quot; (which established Zitkala-Sa's literary reputation) are mostly autobiographical. Some describe her representative experience at a Quaker boarding school in Wabash, Indiana. In these, Zitkala-Sa masterfully makes the reader feel how shocking and horrifying our comfortable culture was to children who grew up in a different-but comfortable-culture, beginning with the cutting of her hair. There are the &quot;loud, metallic voice&quot; of the bell and the &quot;annoying clatter of shoes on bare floors.&quot; There is always a &quot;clash of harsh noises&quot;-but mostly there is the &quot;murmuring of an unknown tongue.&quot; Zitkala-Sa and others are lured to the school by the promise of &quot;red apples&quot;-a clear reference to Genesis. She refers to her own culture for her revenge on the devil.<br />The most poignant tale, one that is frequently anthologized, is &quot;The Widespread Enigma Concerning Blue-Star Woman,&quot; in which a woman must obtain rights she never would have needed but for white man's law through the trickery of two Indian men who have learned dishonesty in the white men's schools. &quot;A Warrior's Daughter,&quot; also often anthologized, tells of an Indian woman who takes action and therefore fate into her own hands-Zitkala-Sa's prescription for women and for her people.<br />&quot;Selections from American Indian Magazine&quot; and &quot;Poetry, Pamphlets, Essays, and Speeches&quot; are largely exhortations and expositions of Zitkala-Sa's viewpoint. In &quot;The Red Man's America,&quot; she satirizes &quot;My Country, 'tis of Thee&quot; to reflect the Indian's disenfranchisement-a favourite theme. Although her advocacy of Indian citizenship was not shared by all Indians (for example, the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy), Zitkala-Sa felt that, without that right in their own country, Indians would continue to languish unnecessarily as wards of the state, without power or basic rights in a democratic land. Other topics include warnings against the use of peyote; the bravery of Indian soldiers during WWI as well as the place that bravery should have earned the Indian in American society and the brotherhood of man; the need for Indians to become educated and to learn English (her own painful school experience notwithstanding); and the Black Hills claim and similar injustices, such as theft of Ute grazing land, the laws against Indian dance, and the lost treaties of the California Indians. To Zitkala-Sa, Indians were not on an even playing field with whites and, until they took action to educate themselves, secure their rights, and obtain the power of legislative and legal representation, they would continue to be helpless to manage their future.<br />I recommend that you read Zitkala-Sa together with On the Rez, Ian Frazier's description of today's life on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Together, they tell a tragic tale of the past 130 years that does not bode well for the &quot;brotherhood of man.&quot;<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />If you are looking for structure and pat solutions to contemporary Native American problems, you won't find them in On the Rez by Ian Frazier. Like the reservation life and stories it reveals, On the Rez is rambling and spontaneous.<br />Frazier uses his sometimes problematic friendship with Le War Lance, a Sioux from Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota whom he meets in New York City, to explore Pine Ridge life today along with past and present injustices. Le seems to have no home, no permanent job, no wife, and no children. He does have family on the reservation-as well as a bottomless taste for inexpensive beer. Frazier recounts their many days spent together, whether it's watching TV while drinking beer, driving around the reservation looking for people, or facing a propane leak and potential explosion-and death. Frazier is genuinely fond of Le, but not of his drinking, and he repeatedly says how much easier it is to be around Le and his brother Floyd John once Floyd John undergoes rehab and gives up drinking. Alcoholism, diabetes, fatal car accidents, and more are part of day-to-day life on Pine Ridge.<br />Frazier also devotes several chapters to the life of SuAnne Big Crow, an Indian high school basketball star who led Pine Ridge's Lady Thorpes basketball team to a state championship and traveled to Europe and Australia as part of an Indian all-star team before her death in a car accident. SuAnne serves as a uniting force between Indians and their often-prejudiced white neighbors, between the lingering Red Cloud and Crazy Bull factions, and between American Indian Movement (AIM) traditionalists and \\"goon\\" progressives on the reservation. Through her athletic feats, fame, and sheer force of personality, she becomes bigger than life.<br />Between describing the day-to-day adventures he has with Le, Floyd John, and their family and friends and SuAnne's career and influence, Frazier turns to history in a broad sense to put life on the rez in perspective. He discusses the rivalry between Red Cloud and Crazy Horse (which lives today); the conflict between AIM, led by Dennis Banks and Russell Means, and then-tribal chief Dick Wilson and his \\"goons\\" (which Wilson turned into \\"Guardians of the Oglala Nation\\"); and the U.S. government's still-unresolved theft of the Black Hills from the Sioux. He covers topics as wide ranging as Iroquois history and Mohawks as high-rise construction workers to the storied past of famous Indian bars. He covers the rise of Indian casinos and their current status in legislative limbo.<br />While many Americans comfort themselves for the wrongs perpetrated against Indians-from physical violence and culture destruction to land theft-with the idea that the white man rescued the Indian from primitivism and stagnation, Frazier points out Native contributions to Europeans, such as a host of agricultural riches (failing to mention the medicinal wonders being mined in South America by ethnobotanists such as Dr. Mark Plotkin).<br />More importantly, Indians passed on to settlers seeking escape from European political, religious, and economic tyranny their \\"all-around skepticism about who and who was not great\\" along with some basic principles of democracy. Today, however, Frazier says, \\"The freedom that inhered in Powhatan, that Red Cloud carried with him from the plains to Washington as easily as air-freedom to be and to say, regardless of disapproval-has become a luxury most of us can't afford.\\" The Indian influence could not prevent the reinvention of Europe-\\"early American was European culture reset in an Indian frame.\\" Frazier quote Thomas Jefferson: \\"It will be said, that great societies cannot exist without government. The savages, therefore, break them into small ones.\\" Where Frazier errs is in being too broad-while the free-ranging Sioux of the plains valued individual freedom, less nomadic groups such as Powhatan's and the tribes of the Iroquoisconfederacy placed more emphasis on leadership. Powhatan's freedom was that of a leader, while Red Cloud's was that of a Sioux.<br />Today, there is Le War Lance, representing Trickster-cunning, dishonest, unpredictable, selfish, manipulative-a freedom-loving survivor. There is, or was until her death, the Indian hero SuAnne Big Crow, to whom nearly every inner-city and suburban teenager and adult alike can look-sports legend, academic star, role model for peers, and point of unity among a disparate people, even today through \\"Happytown, USA\\"-the SuAnne Big Crow Health and Recreation Center founded in her memory by her mother, Chick Big Crow.<br />Then there are the rest of the Sioux-struggling with poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, disease, and a host of social ills that cannot be fixed through this program or that legislation. They, like Le, are survivors.<br />I recommend that you read On the Rez in conjunction with American Indian Stories, Legends, and Other Writings by Zitkala-Sa and edited with an introduction and notes by Cathy N.

Not recommended.<br />In A Virtuous Woman, Kaye Gibbons tells the story of the daughter of Southern gentry, Ruby Pitt Woodrow Stokes; her tenant farmer second husband, Jack Stokes; and those who affect their lives mostBurr, his wife Tiny Fran, her delinquent son Roland, and their daughter June.<br />Gibbons uses a technique of alternating chapters, with the first written by Jack, the next by Ruby, and so on, until the last chapter. Chapter sixteen is written in the third person omniscient, with characters' thoughts sprinkled throughout in italics. This method is effective in the beginning, where Jack talks about his reaction to the news that Ruby has been diagnosed with lung cancer and her silent, selfish request for a cigarette, while next she talks about her response to his reaction and her own motivation. Further into the plot, however, this method loses its impact as the reminiscences become more random and less structured.<br />Although the idea of alternating chapters, most flashbacks except Jack's chapters toward the end, lends itself to a more dynamic approach to time, Gibbons keeps it virtually linear, from Ruby's youth and disastrous first marriage to a drunken, controlling migrant worker named John Woodrow and his death to her marriage to Jack, the notable events of their lives, Ruby's death, and Jack's life after Ruby.<br />Although A Virtuous Woman is well written and in a few instances somewhat insightful. The characters often seem to lack interest or depth; some, like Woodrow, Tiny Fran, and Roland, are little more than stock rural characters (no-good man, no-good teenaged girl, no-good bastard). They appear primarily to fulfill a standard a role and have little interestthey exist only to explain such things as Ruby's path toward Jack and the Stokes's unusual interest in Burr and Tiny Fran's daughter June. When Woodrow is critically injured in a drunken brawl, the wives of the other migrant workers feel Ruby should \\"stand by her man\\" no matter what, which also seems to perpetuate a type rather than offer any real insight.<br />Above all, A Virtuous Woman feels forced and unnatural. It is out of character for a barely literate man like Jack Stokes to document his memories, including quoted conversations, in such detail and with such care. This would have been a stronger story if presented as an oral history rather than a written one.<br />The unlikely love story and marriage of Jack Stokes and Ruby Pitt Woodrow Stokes has potential, as do the characters. Unfortunately, Gibbons does not have the depth as an author to uncover it.<br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Discovered in France after D. H. Lawrence's death and never finalized by the author, The Virgin and the Gipsy is the fairy tale-like story of Yvette Saywell, a 19-year-old rector's daughter chafing against the moral \\"life unbelievers\\" that make up her family.<br />Although the \\"virgin\\" of the title, Yvette is no demure maiden. She is temperamental, strong willed, and aware of her father's \\"degrading unbelief, the worm which was his heart's core\\"-just as her fallen mother was. She enjoys being contrary and openly contemptuous of her middle-class, overtly moral, covertly disturbed family. Her every exposure to life leaves her harder; \\"She lost her illusions in the collapse of her sympathies.\\" She loathes the rectory \\"with a loathing that consumed her life.\\"<br />The most hated person in the Saywell family is the rector's ancient, blind mother, called \\"The Mater\\" or \\"Granny.\\" Yvette hates her. Her sister Lucille hates her. Their aunt Cissie hates her. She is compared to a toad, a reptile, a fungus. Like the toad that snaps its jaws on all the bees exiting the hive and devouring all life around it, The Mater, who gave literal life to the family, absorbs the entire family's energy and life force. The gardener smashes the toad with a stone in oblique foreshadowing of The Mater's fate.<br />Yvette is keenly aware of her status as a \\"moral unbeliever\\" (like her mother, who ran off with young man when Lucille and Yvette were children) and her virgin power. When she finds herself in the company of a virile gipsy man and his \\"lonely, predative glance,\\" she finds herself in his virile power, \\"gone in his will.\\"<br />The gipsy represents her \\"free-born will,\\" which separates her from the rest of the Saywells. He is an outsider, \\"on an old, old war-path against such as herself . . . Yes, if she belonged to any side, and to any clan, it was to his.\\" Under the influence of the absent mother, an adulterous couple she encounters, and the defiant gipsy who \\"endures in opposition,\\" Yvette is forced into a confrontation with her sneering father-a confrontation that brings out his hidden evil and self-righteousness.<br />The Virgin and the Gipsy is an odd novel, much of it written in the style of an adult fairy tale. \\"The Mater could be a variation of \\"The Wicked Queen,\\" while \\"She-who-was-Cynthia,\\" the \\"white snowflower\\" of a myth or tale, blooming in perpetuity, could be the prodigal Princess whose transformation into a degraded nettle threatens the self-satisfied and lethal stability of the Saywells. The deluge that puts an end to this uncomfortable status quo is at first mysterious in origin, purging the world as it does on a clear, sunny, rainless day. The gipsy could be the Prince or the traveler, come from afar and finally fulfilling his role in the tale as rescuer-literally and figuratively.<br />Lawrence was known for rewriting and editing many times over, and clearly The Virgin and Gipsy lacks his revision. Yet its themes of female sexuality, male power over it, the immorality of conventional morality, and the sacredness of vitality that are explored in depth in Lady Chatterley's Lover and Women in Love, are here presented in a beautifully distilled form-perhaps more haunting for its very simplicity.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />Coincidentally, I happened to read this collection of Victorian short stories focused on love relationships concurrently with a book of Victorian erotic short stories and George Eliot's Middlemarch (set earlier in the 19th century). Although there are occasional hints of the erotic or sexual in many of the love stories, most of them are about love and romance disconnected from the physical-love with all the proprieties. It's almost as if the Victorian erotica fills in the missing pieces in the love stories that would be private and not observable (those things the characters truly think and feel but which is unacceptable to reveal or acknowledge in public, along with the erotic).<br />The love stories are, for the most part, about acceptable if not always successful relationships, whereas the erotica is largely about questionable or illicit relationships. Middlemarch made an interesting companion, since at least one of the key relationships, Dorothea and Causaubon, appear to experience neither love nor Eros. In the end, both the love stories and the erotica may seem unbalanced because each seems incomplete-as though one can have love or sex, but not both. Is the balance as difficult to achieve in life as it is in literature?<br />Flint's collection is outstanding in its scope, including stories by authors who are not well known to today's average reader as well as stories by such authors as Anthony Trollope, Henry James, Wilkie Collins, Thomas Hardy, Somerset Maugham, Rudyard Kipling, and Oscar Wilde. The stories include young love, middle-aged love (a welcome change from today's focus on youth), deception, fantasy, fairy tale, class issues, religious differences, urban and rural life, changing mores, rejection and pain, and the proper and improper. There is even a touch of silliness in W. S. Gilbert's \\"An Elixir of Love\\" and a surprise ending in Ellen T. Fowler's \\"An Old Wife's Tale.\\"<br />The settings range from urban London to rural villages; from rough coastal areas (Anthony Trollope's \\"Malachi's Cove\\") to mythical locales ( Christiana Rossetti's \\"Hero,\\" Laurence Housman's \\"The Story of the Herons\\"); from hints of the supernatural (Wilkie's \\"The Captain's Last Love\\" and Amelia B. Edwards' \\"Salome\\") to other worlds (Olive Schreiner's \\"In a Far-Off World\\"); from the urban (A. St. John Adcock's \\"Bob Harris's Deputy\\") to the bucolic (James' \\"A Day of Days\\"); from the familiar (stories set in the United Kingdom) to the exotic (Ernest Dowson's \\"The Statute of Limitations,\\" Kipling's \\"Georgie Porgie,\\" Flora Annie Steel's \\"Uma Himavutee\\"). The one thing all the stories have in common is love-happy love, unrequited love, frustrated love, deceptive love, miserable love, tragic love-love and what passes for love in its complex facets.<br />Despite the subject matter, there is little that is sickly sweet in this collection. Love is not always touching or uplifting; sometimes it is deeply bitter. Most of the stories are memorable; some are unforgettable (Lucy Clifford's \\"The End of Her Journey,\\" Hubert Crackenthorpe's \\"A Conflict of Egoisms\\"). No matter how you feel about love, you are sure to find a beautifully written story here that will resonate with your experiences.<br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />In his introduction to The Reef, Louis Auchincloss notes that modern readers may not appreciate a moral climate in which a woman opposes her stepson's engagement to a girl who has had an affair with the man the woman is about to marry. The Reef, however, is as concerned with morality as with class.<br />On his way to France to see his beloved, the widowed Anna Leath, George Darrow receives a telegram telling him not to come \\"till thirtieth\\" due to \\"unexpected obstacle.\\" As time passes and he doesn't receive an explanation for the delay, he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation. At one point, he imagines the umbrellas and elbows of his fellow travelers saying, \\"She doesn't want you, doesn't want you, doesn't want you.\\"<br />As he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to London or to press forward, he encounters Sophy Viner, a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended. She is on her way to Paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career. Darrow, who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer, finds himself manipulating Sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison. He is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty.<br />A year later, Anna Leath eagerly anticipates Darrow's arrival, for they are to be married and begin an overseas stint as part of his diplomatic career. She is also excited because her stepson, Owen Leath, wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic, old-fashioned grandmother; he wants to marry Anna's daughter's governess, who is none other than Sophy Viner.<br />Darrow and Sophy's secret is safe with one another, yet Darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant Anna wants him to support Owen's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities. He tries to convince Sophy that Owen is not right for her. \\"You'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours,\\" she says \\"not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact.\\" Darrow's lack of feeling and poor conduct make Sophy an undesirable wife for Owen. She is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions.<br />Auchincloss calls Sophy a \\"fallen woman\\" in the context of the times, but this is too simplistic. The real issue with Sophy, both before and after Anna finds out about her relationship with Darrow, is her class and lack of social background. After all, in The House of Mirth, extramarital liaisons are commonplace, understood, and accepted if they are discreet and do not upset the social balance. Within the correct parameters, such affairs become a comfortable topic of gossip and speculation.<br />Once Anna has finally divined that there has been something between Darrow and Sophy beyond the casual acquaintance previously admitted, he acknowledges it by saying simply, \\"She has given me up.\\" This does not refer to Sophy's feelings, but to her expectations. Sophy has learned that, in the world she inhabits, the Darrows seek temporary solace from the Sophys, but permanence and stability from the Annas.<br />The issue that Anna keeps returning to is not that Darrow has deeper feelings for Sophy, but that Sophy has been there before, whether it is to the theatre with Darrow or in Darrow's arms--. True, the liaison happened while he was on his way to Anna and she is bothered by that, but it does not dwell so much in her thoughts as that the kiss he places on her neck has also landed on Sophy's-and that Sophy has been even more intimate with him than she has. Anna asks Darrow, \\"Do such things happen to men often?\\" (phrased passively, as though Darrow had been the pursued rather than the pursuer). \\"I don't know what happens to other men. Such a thing never happened to me . . .\\" The \\"thing\\" here is not the physical aspect of the relationship. Even the \\"fine\\" Anna knows that he has indulged because one of his relationships, with a mutual acquaintance named Kitty, drove her away from him in their youth. The fact is that this relationship is outside their social sphere and reflects a lack of discretion that may make him an unsuitable husband and stepparent.<br />Sophy, with her finely tuned perceptions, her delicacy, her generosity, and her genuine feelings (Darrow assures Anna that she is no adventuress, which Anna wants her to be), does not deserve her fate. She goes off to India to return to the service of Mrs. Murrett. In one of the weaknesses of The Reef, Anna's encounter with Sophy's fat, frowsy, common sister and her equally common lover, Jimmy Brance, puts the noble Sophy in her proper place for both Anna and the reader.<br />The Reef is in shallower waters than The House of Mirth or The Age of Innocence, and its structure is weakened by a forced reliance on dialogue. A large part of the final third consists of various characters talking to Anna in her room, coming and going what may as well be a revolving door. Sophy's fate further weakens the drama. Yet, who but Wharton could write, \\"Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and fears\\"? Such elegant prose and insights alone distinguish The Reef.<br />(As an aside, it would be interesting if, in the same fashion Jean Rhys gave Bertha Mason from Jane Eyre \\"a life,\\" a writer were to do the same for Sophy, whose viewpoint is never shown.)<br />Diane L.

US	52876068	R15NKMRS7NXBS8	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	3	10	11	N	N	A not-so-beautiful heart	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash by Sylvia Nasar. Recommended.<br />The prologue to Sylvia Nasar's biography of Nobel Laureate John Nash, Jr., summarizes the mathematical marvel's life thus: genius, madness, reawakening.<br />Nash, who was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize for Economics in a controversy that would ultimately change the nature of the prize, is the child of mostly unremarkable parents. His father, John, Sr., held a middle-manager position with the Appalachian Power Company inspecting power lines, while his mother, Virginia, was a \\"public-school thinker.\\" Despite his mother's efforts to push him, he remains socially isolated, without any close friends. In the fourth grade, he begins to demonstrate the original approach to problems that will become his hallmark as a genius. Interestingly enough, it will be an extensive network of friends and peers that helps to ensure Nash's place in academic and Nobel history.<br />Nash may have a \\"beautiful mind\\" with a unique way of looking at difficult problems, but Nasar does not portray him as a likeable man in his pre-mental illness heyday. Lacking in social skills and graces but not in ego, he is a class snob. Like many boys and young men, he plays pranks-but many of his have pathological undertones. Some cause serious physical pain and embarrassment. Others have the potential to cause death (one person recounts how a Nash prank might have resulted in electrocution of the victim). As a student and young academic, he delights in one-upmanship and in the humiliation of less-gifted men. In a recurring theme, he will flirt romantically with other bright young men. Much is forgiven Nash by his mentors and peers, however, because of his unquestioned mathematical gifts and because such behavior (at least, to some extent) is expected of great mathematical minds.<br />At the peak of his career, Nash succumbs to what is diagnosed as schizophrenia, which Nasar implies may have been the result of stress brought about by concerns about being drafted and Nash's insistence on tackling near-impossible problems and the resulting frustrations. Whatever the cause, Nash becomes delusional, thinking aliens are speaking to him through The New York Times and feeling a compelling need to renounce his U.S. citizenship and to become a world citizen. For the next 30 years, Nash-and his genius-will be lost to the world, which, if it thinks of him at all, thinks him dead.<br />It is only a few years before he is nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics (for his contributions to game theory) that Nash will slowly emerge from his illness. During this time, much of the mathematics community, including friends and rivals who were uncomfortable with his illness, rally behind him. Through most of his adult life, his wife, Alicia, is there to take care of him-even after marriage, divorce, and remarriage.<br />To write A Beautiful Mind, Nasar read and interviewed dozens of mathematicians, physicists, economists, and other academics as well as psychiatrists and mental health experts, making the book more than just a biography of John Nash, Jr. It is also an insightful overview of the tightly knit mathematics worlds of Princeton, MIT, and RAND Corporation during the 1940s and 1950s. Nash's treatment at several private and public mental health institutions is revealing and sometimes horrifying, especially when he is treated with insulin shock therapy. The political climate-the draft for the Korean conflict, anti-Semitism, McCarthyism and its chilling effect on American academia, and the arms and space races with the Soviets-are all vivid parts of Nash's story.<br />It is probably in the nature of biography that the author cannot be entirely subjective toward his or her subject; after all, he or she must have enough passion about that subject to research and write hundreds of pages about it. Nasar is clearly a fan of Nash's; she often excuses or glosses over his youthfulbad behaviour, his capacious ego, his poor treatment of those he considers inferior (including his girlfriend Eleanor and their son John David Stier), and his obsessive competitiveness. She describes him repeatedly as \\"handsome\\" with an \\"Olympian body\\" and \\"finely modeled\\" or \\"chiseled\\" features. (The photos included show Nash to have an average face and body.)<br />Nasar speeds through the 1970s and 1980s, no doubt because they were uneventful for the \\"Phantom of Fine Hall.\\" This leaves the reader to wonder what Nash's official position was at Princeton (he tells a visitor he shouldn't go into the faculty club). At this time, he appears to have had an office and is tolerated by students and staff alike.<br />I am always interested in genius, especially genius derailed by an enigmatic mental illness such as schizophrenia. A question (not to be answered) might be: Is Nash a genius despite schizophrenia, or is the schizophrenia an inherent part of what makes him a genius? Are the two conditions distinct, or are they inseparable? At any rate, while Nash may not have what I would consider a \\"beautiful mind,\\" it is certainly a gifted-and cursed-one.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />Ethan Frome is a powerful story about powerless people. The title character is held in thrall by his parents, his land, his poverty, and his lifeless and loveless marriage. His wife, Zenobia (Zeena), cannot escape the confines of her narrow mind; her imaginary illnesses and the status they give her in a small village like the aptly named Starkfield, Massachusetts; and the meanness of her own life (symbolised by her attachment to her pickle dish and her refusal to use it, even for visits by the minister). Finally, there is Mattie Silver, the relative who has come to help care for Zeena and the house and who has nowhere to go. Interestingly, the three prisoners are related; Zeena is referred to as a cousin of Ethan's, while Mattie is Zeena's cousin. Zeena is, literally and figuratively, the central figure who connects them all and who keeps Ethan and Mattie apart.<br />From his youth, Ethan's impulsive, reactive nature leads him into trouble. When Zeena helps him out with the care of his mother, who dies and leaves him alone and lonely, \\"before he knew what he was doing, he had asked her [Zeena] to stay there with him.\\" It is soon thereafter that he discovers that his loneliness gave him selective vision and that Zeena is more than a good nurse; she's an excellent hypochondriac. When someone asks him if he lacks money, \\"'Not a bit,' Ethan's pride retorted before his reason had time to intervene.\\"<br />Ethan is hindered from all he desires, whether it's his technical education, his potential career as an engineer, or the arms of Mattie Silver, by his prevailing sense of duty and honor. Although he feels trapped on his land and in a farming life with which he is not happy because he has had a succession of people for whom to care-first, his father, then his mother, then Zeena-Ethan tells Mattie, \\"I want to be there when you're sick and when you're lonesome.\\" Later, his last thought before unconsciousness will be about his responsibility to his horse: \\"I ought to be getting him his feed . . .\\" He struggles constantly with his need to be free of Zeena and his obligation to take care of her.<br />Zeena and Mattie are contrasted throughout; Zeena's lashless lids are nothing like Mattie's fully lashed lids, which Ethan observes \\"sinking slowly when anything charmed or moved her.\\" Her laughter is seen \\"sparkling through her lashes.\\" While Zeena is thin and hard, Ethan sees Mattie (in Zeena's overnight absence) as \\"taller, fuller, more womanly in shape and motion\\" than when she is under Zeena's watchful eye. Light, which brings out the sharp hollows of Zeena's face as in a horror film, \\"threw a lustrous fleck on [Mattie's] lips, edged her eyes with velvet shade, and laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her brows.\\" Is this Mattie as she really is, or is this Mattie as Ethan's loneliness and imagination needs her to be.<br />Around Mattie, Ethan is often overcome by the strength of his emotions. When she serves him dinner, with the cat lying drowsily by the stove in a carefully drawn domestic scene, \\"Ethan was suffocated with the sense of well-being.\\" This sense of being overcome recurs throughout their encounters. He doubts that he inspires such a glow. \\"Could it be his coming that gave her such a kindled face?\\" He is jealous of every man Mattie encounters, particularly the wealthy Irish grocer's son, Denis Eady.<br />Whether Wharton is writing of society New York or rural New England, such an illicit romance cannot succeed, and Ethan's fails spectacularly-leaving behind people who are emotional and physical wrecks. Zeena is transformed into reluctant caregiver, while Mattie is transformed into yet another part of the trap that keeps Ethan on the farm, impoverished financially, intellectually, and emotionally. His emotions about his fate and that of his would-be lover are never revealed other than through an indescribable look that haunts those who witness it. In life, all are more dead than the Fromes in the graveyard. Ethan Frome is the literary embodiment of Wharton's quote, \\"Life is the saddest thing, next to death.\\"<br />Ethan Frome's framework is awkward; a narrator from outside Starkfield manages to get into Ethan's home and learn the whole story, which then is improbably told in great detail in third-person omniscient. This detracts only slightly from the novel's wintry, claustrophobic atmosphere and evocative powers. In her introduction, Wharton calls the reader \\"sophisticated\\" and the people of whom she writes \\"simple\\"-as stark as the New England backdrop. Yet Ethan Frome, for all his \\"simplicity,\\" is a rich, fully realised person as memorable as Newland Archer (The Age of Innocence)-and as tragic as Lily Bart (The House of Mirth).<br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Surprisingly, Madame Bovary begins with a look at the painful childhood of the seemingly dull and plodding man who will become the title character's longsuffering husband, Charles Bovary. The novel commences with a mysterious &quot;we&quot;-the identity of the narrator who tells the story of Bovary's ignominious entry into school is not known-but then changes to third-person omniscient. Charles is a conscientious, yet average, student, whose school, career, lodgings, and even first wife are selected by his mother. His marriage to Emma Bovary, the daughter of an apparently prosperous farmer, is the first major decision he makes for himself about his life and borders on an act of rebellion. That this act of independence should have such tragic consequences only adds to their effect.<br />Like many of her class, Emma is a romantic dreamer-but one who expects others to make those dreams into reality. Within a short time of her wedding, perhaps even on the day after, &quot;the bride made not the slightest sign that could be taken to betray anything at all.&quot; For Charles Bovary, however, marriage to Emma-following as it does on the heels of his first marriage to a thin, complaining huissier's widow whose financial assets prove to be negligible-seems to be the culmination of happiness. &quot;He was happy now, without a care in the world.&quot; Every moment spent with her, each of her gestures, &quot;and many other things in which it had never occurred to him to look for pleasure-such now formed the steady current of his happiness.&quot;<br />When her marriage proves to be a plunge into a provincial life devoid of the romance promised by books, arts, and a naïve imagination, Madame Bovary blames her average, unambitious husband, Flaubert writes, &quot;. . . following formulas she believed efficacious, she kept trying to experience love . . . Having thus failed to produce the slightest spark of love in herself, and since she was incapable of understanding what she didn't experience, or of recognizing anything that wasn't expressed in conventional terms, she reached the conclusion that Charles's desire for her was nothing very extraordinary.&quot; With that inescapable conclusion in mind, Emma is free to find &quot;love&quot; elsewhere-for example, in a recurring fantasy about a count who dances with her at an aristocrat's party; with the worldly Rodolphe Boulanger for whom she is little more than another in a string of mistresses; and for the young student-clerk L&eacute;on Dupuis for whom she is a brilliant, sympathetic flower among the colorless bourgeoisie.<br />Although Steegmuller mentions in the &quot;Translator's Introduction,&quot; &quot;Flaubert's supposed conception of his heroine as a character too sublime for this world,&quot; Emma is neither sublime nor sympathetic. Rather than seek happiness within or to improve herself, or to appreciate the value of even her uninspiring husband, she blames others for the monotony of her life and its lack of excitement and passion. She cannot find consolation in her daughter (&quot;she wanted a son&quot;), and neglects and even mistreats her. She tries to bolster herself through Charles's position, at the cost of a young man's leg. The village abb&eacute;, Bournisien, is oblivious to her emotional turmoil and pain and advises her to &quot;drink a cup of tea&quot; as a remedy. His nemesis Homais, a pseudoscientific pharmacist who is the archetype for the petit bourgeoisie, drowns out all around him with his droning theories and ideas, including Madame Bovary and his hapless assistant Justin. There are no kindred spirits for Emma in either Tostes or Yonville l'Abbaye.<br />As her actions lead her into a downward emotional and financial spiral, Emma finds nothing around her to which to turn and no one to help, except if she is willing to prostitute herself. Her life, built on her dreams and her sacrifice of others, is doomed. By the end of the novel, she has been reduced to little more than a scheming adulteress and petty debtor. Ironically, her husband's passion and grief for her bring out the personal nobility to which she was purposely blind. He has always had that to which she aspired.<br />Although Emma Bovary is certainly impossible to forget, equally memorable are all the novel's supporting characters, from Tuvache and his lathe and the lovesick Justin to Homais, whose banality throughout may be summed up by his award of the cross of the Legion of Honor. This last is a suitable ending for this study of the patterns of provincial life.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 13 June 2003.ams and her sacrifice of others, is doomed.

US	52876068	R22ZKFU3EEDEYH	0374518653	314257140	The Collected Stories of Colette	Books	5	44	46	N	N	A full life	The Collected Stories of Colette by Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, ed., and with an introduction by, Robert Phelps. Highly recommended.<br />According to the introduction, this collection represents 100 stories taken from a dozen volumes published during Colette's lifetime. They are categorised as \\"Early Stories,\\" Backstage at the Music Hall,\\" \\"Varieties of Human Nature,\\" and \\"Love.\\" Some, like the Clouk/Ch&eacute;ri stories, appear to be fiction, while many, like \\"The Rainy Moon\\" and \\"Bella-Vista,\\" seem to be taken straight from Colette's varied life and acquaintances.<br />Whether writing fiction or chronicling fact, whether writing in the third-person omniscient or in the first person, Colette herself is always a character-rarely as an influencer, that is, one whose actions or choices drive the plot. Colette's preferred role is as observer-and it is one for which she is well suited.<br />An inveterate sensualist and a former music-hall performer, Colette integrates her characters (real and fictional) with everything around them-their clothes (costumes), their abodes, dressing rooms, and haunts (sets), and their neighborhoods and towns (theatres). Much of Colette's writing, no matter how mundane the surface subject, is about art-the art of living and, notably, the art of loving. In \\"My Goddaughter,\\" the subject tells her godmother how she injured herself with scissors and a curling iron and recounts her mother's reaction. \\"She said that I had ruined her daughter for her! She said, 'What have you done with my beautiful hair which I tended so patiently? . . . And that cheek, who gave you permission to spoil it! . . . I've taken years, I've spent my days and nights, trembling over this masterpiece. . . .\\"<br />Colette is attuned to everything, every sense, every nuance. \\"A faint fragrance did indeed bring to my nostrils the memory of various scents which are at their strongest in autumn.\\" (\\"Gibriche\\") \\". . . set in a bracelet, which slithered between her fingers like a cold and supple snake.\\" (\\"The Bracelet\\") \\" . . . the supper of rare fruits, an[d]of ice water sparkling in the thin glasses, as intoxicating as champagne . . .\\" (\\"Florie\\") \\"Peroxided hair, light-colored eyes, white teeth, something about her of an appetizing but slightly vulgar young washerwoman.\\" (\\"Gitanette\\")<br />Colette does not pretend to be an objective observer of human behaviour; she does not hesitate to express to the reader her weariness with certain individuals or situations, and her stories of her vain, pretentious, overbearing friend Valentine reveal her jaded and waning affection. She knows this woman so well that she sees her almost as Valentine sees herself-a drama queen acting out stories, roles, and games without depth of feeling for them. \\"What Must We Look Like?\\" becomes Valentine's driving philosophy, to which Colette responds with \\"a mild, a kindly pity.\\" In \\"The Hard Worker,\\" Colette says, \\"I can see she does not hate him, but I cannot see she loves him either.\\" What Colette sees-and does not see-is to be respected.<br />Some stories, such as \\"The Sick Child,\\" are vivid and imaginative and reveal Colette's amazing ability to think and dream like a gifted child. \\"The Advice,\\" with its mundane beginning and premise and twisted, horrifying ending would enhance any collection of gothic or mystery tales. Other stories, like \\"Gibriche,\\"  several of the other music-hall stories, and \\"Bella-Vista,\\" tackle topics that even today remain controversial. \\"Bella-Vista,\\" in which Colette's moods seem to wane with every familiarity achieved with her hostesses, offers an ending that is heavily foreshadowed throughout but is surprising and gruesome nonetheless.<br />Most of the stories, whether fiction or nonfiction, seem to come from life in one way or another. The quantity of stories and the quality of the collection reveal the incredible scope of experience of Colette, the dry, often weary yet obsessive observer, interpreter, and chronicler of human nature. As Judith Thurman says in her introduction to Colette's work, The Pure and the Impure, \\"This great ode to emptiness was written by a woman who felt full.\\" As well she should.<br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Sons and Lovers is said to be the most autobiographical of D. H. Lawrence's novels; according to the introduction by Benjamin DeMott, some critics have found it too flatly so. Like the protagonist Paul Morel, Lawrence was born to a coal miner and a woman who has married beneath her class, and his older brother died young, DeMott notes. Many other details coincide as well.<br />Unlike some of Lawrence's other works, such as Women in Love, in which Lawrence explores lofty themes in a philosophical and often grim tone, Sons and Lovers is as down to earth as Paul's rough, violent, yet congenial father Walter. Despite his many apparent and iterated flaws, Walter Morel is shown as a whole person rather than a fictional creation, with a gentle, content, industrious side, at least when he's sober. Perhaps his \\"smallness\\" is a function of where he is and who he is expected to be rather than who he could be. He's so tied to his lot in life, the mining life, that it never occurs to him that his more gifted sons could aspire to more. That they achieve more is a source of both pride and derision for Walter Morel. Although Walter is a background character (to both reader and to the Morel family), it is he, \\"an outsider,\\" who forges the bond between Gertrude Morel and her sons, first William, then Paul.<br />Gertrude Morel is not the first woman to try to live her life through her children, but her hold over her sons dooms their relationships with other women to failure and leaves them deeply unsatisfied and unhappy. Her motivations may be questionable, but she is sometimes right. William's fianc&eacute;e Lily would have cost him dearly, emotionally and financially, had he lived to marry her, and Mrs. Morel sees her own mistake of a marriage in his future. Although she makes her beliefs known, she seems willing to let William make his decision and suffer the consequences.<br />Having learned from the experience with William, Mrs. Morel takes a different approach with Paul, who seems to be her last, best hope for justifying her own life. Her relationship with Paul becomes overtly sexual. When they go out together, they behave like lovers on a date. \\"He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.\\" When Paul tells his mother that he doesn't love Miriam (how can he?), she \\"kissed him in a long, fervent kiss. 'My boy!' she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love. Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.\\"<br />It would be too easy to attribute all this to an Oedipal complex, but it is more complicated, as life is. Paul serves as Mrs. Morel's alter ego, pseudo-lover, and breadwinner. Everything she did not or cannot have must be Paul's. She is savvy enough to know who is a threat to her hold and who is not. She recognises in Miriam a woman much like herself-intelligent, thwarted, let down by men, hungry for a kindred spirit or soul mate. Paul, too, is aware of this and hates Miriam for it-and for the fact he does, indeed, love her, making him unfaithful to the woman to whom he owes his fidelity. There are spiritual overtones as well, as the religious Miriam tries to sacrifice herself for Paul, whom she sees as a \\"Walter Scott hero.\\" This sacrifice repels Paul ever further.<br />Mrs. Morel rightly perceives that Clara Dawes is not a threat to her-she is fascinating, attractive, enigmatic, and sensual, but she lacks the ability to be more to Paul than a diversion from Miriam, Mom, and himself. Knowing that nothing of importance will come of this affair, Mrs. Morel even encourages it. It cannot divert Paul from her, and it fails as a result.<br />In the end, the only intimacy Paul is capable of is with his mother. She has come between him and his own consciousness-and he has allowed her. Everything is filtered through her. How she has achieved this is not always clear, as she uses more than rhetoric and conscious effort to mold Paul. When he wishes her dead, there is hopethat then he would begin to live. \\"Mother!\\" he whimpered. \\"Mother!\\" Then: \\"He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her.\\" With the past buried, there may be a future for him. Only Lawrence knew as he wrote this most human of his novels...then he would begin to live. \\"Mother!\\" he whimpered. \\"Mother!\\" Then: \\"He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her.\\" With the past buried, there may be a future for him.

Recommended.<br />Willa Cather is known as the chronicler of the American prairie and frontier, having written such novels as O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, and Death Comes from the Archbishop. My &Aacute;ntonia is also set in the prairie midwest, Nebraska, where the Jim Burden finds himself living with his paternal grandparents after the death of his parents in Virginia and where &Aacute;ntonia Shimerda and her family find themselves in search of a better life than that offered by their native Bohemia. The tale, or series of tales, are told by lawyer Jim Burden as his remembrances of &Aacute;ntonia. Tellingly, when he hands over his manuscript to a journalist who also knew &Aacute;ntonia, he adds the \\"My\\" in front of her name, which \\"seemed to satisfy him.\\"<br />My &Aacute;ntonia is an episodic novel, and &Aacute;ntonia herself is often absent from the story. In many ways, she did not seem to me to be a clearly defined, real character or even a part of the novel named for her, but more of a symbol of the westward expansion and growth of America.<br />&Aacute;ntonia-daughter, sister, lover, wife, mother-seems to be an everywoman. She is sensual and maternal, intelligent and hard working, naïve and shrewd. While narrator Jim Burden finds her attractive and desirable, their relationship never extends beyond friendship. This is an interesting point, since the framing narrator does not find much to praise in the woman Jim Burden marries, whom he describes in oddly masculine terms: \\"handsome, energetic, executive, but to me she seems unimpressionable and temperamentally incapable of enthusiasm.\\" She may be Mrs. Burden but she is not my &Aacute;ntonia.<br />&Aacute;ntonia's family, the Shimerdas, are a reminder that, despite snobbery on the part of long-settled families, there is no American who didn't originate elsewhere. One character says, \\"So it's Norwegians now, is it? I thought this was Americy.\\" Americy, poor and wealthy, rural and urban, is a society built not around a common history, past, or ethnic background, but around the land. For &Aacute;ntonia's father, Mr. Shimerda, the bleak land of winter cannot replace the richness of the camaraderie of his Bohemian friends at home. Even the Bohemians in the new country cannot compensate for the loss-they are, after all, now Americans. Fittingly, Mr. Shimerda rests at a crossroads, where man marks where the four directions meet.<br />Small-town America is no less provincial than its European prototype. In Blackhawk, &Aacute;ntonia and the other \\"country girls\\" bring what the new country needs to grow as Jefferson envisioned: youth, enthusiasm, and unfettered sensuality that threatens the newly settled middle class.<br />As in other Cather novels, most notably The Song of the Lark, no matter how fond characters may be of their rural roots, opportunity in America lies elsewhere-for Jim Burden, as a lawyer working for a western railway and living in New York, far removed from Blackhawk and his life on his grandparents' farm. &Aacute;ntonia, however, after a disastrous sojourn in Denver, finds herself back in the country, doing what many American women had done before and have done since-raising the future generations the new country needs. While Jim contributes to industrial growth, &Aacute;ntonia is Earth Mother, producing the future. There may be a feminist dig here; Cather and her characters are well aware that, for now, the nature of opportunities for men and women are worlds apart, as is the nature of what they can accomplish. Indeed, the topic troubles Burden as he watches the activities of the country girls. In the end, he marries the woman the framing narrator does not like while &Aacute;ntonia the sensualist seems spiritually free in her earthy existence.<br />My &Aacute;ntonia is the story of America-written by those like Jim Burden, but also written by Norwegians, Swedes, Bohemians-and Africans, as Cather works in the story of the blind piano and his \\"instrument,\\" a double entendre for his piano and his sensuality. To understand America and her story, you must understand Jim, &Aacute;ntonia, &Aacute;ntonia's grasping brother and mother-and Mr. Shimerda, too.

Recommended.<br />In this poetic novel by poet Michael Ondaatje, the author explores the past and present (the closing days of World War II) lives of young Canadian nurse Hana, her English patient, her family friend and accomplished thief David Caravaggio, and Indian sapper Kirpal Singh (nicknamed Kip).<br />Hana, who has lost her father and her lover during the war, has been desensitised and traumatised-only 19, she has held cigarettes to the lips of armless boys and moved patients only to find that they are already being consumed by worms. When the Italian villa-turned-hospital where she works is abandoned toward the end of the conflict, she insists on remaining behind with the one patient who cannot be moved-an enigmatic English patient whose skin is burned black from a plane crash in North Africa and who does not seem to remember who he is. The only clue he carries is The Histories of Herodotus, which he uses as a commonplace book.<br />Caravaggio, thief turned intelligence agent, has lost the practical use of his hands when he is caught stealing by the Italians and loses his thumbs as a physically and emotionally brutal punishment. A morphine addict, Caravaggio cannot rest until he knows all the secrets-those of Hana's heart but especially those of the mysterious Englishman.<br />Like the others, Kip belongs nowhere to no one. Estranged from his family by his nontraditional beliefs and pursuits, he is also a man without a country-an Indian sapper in an English army that does not welcome foreigners, especially Indians. A loner by nature and by circumstances, Kip finds respite if not meaning in Hana's arms.<br />For a professed amnesiac, the English patient remembers great detail, from his post-accident discovery in the desert by Bedouins and their subsequent treatment of his injuries to his earlier life as a member of a 1930s group of explorers seeking to answer such riddles as how Cambyses and his army could attempt to cross a desert-unless there were a Zerzura to be found. Of equal or greater importance to his exploration reminiscences are his memories of his hot affair with a fellow explorer's wife that burns itself out in tragedy.<br />The long passages in which the English patient slowly unravels (but never admits to) the mystery of his identity and past are intriguing, spellbinding, revealing, and poetic. Those with any curiosity will find themselves wanting to read more about not only 1930s European expeditions into the desert, but about the desert itself-where dozens of different types of winds inspire the Bedouins to don them with dozens of beautiful names descriptive of their moods.<br />On the other hand, Caravaggio, who feels safest revealing nothing, pieces together his own knowledge with the clues dropped by the English patient to come up with a plausible theory about his identity, actions, and movements during the war-but not his motivations. Even as his name and his past are gradually unveiled, his character remains elusive-perhaps explaining why Hana is in love with the living remains of a dead man.<br />Hana and Kip, and their relationship, are the least interesting elements of the novel. Hana's character functions as the center around which the others meet. As a sapper, Kip's duty of disarming bombs becomes virtually his sole focus in life. When he learns of the ultimate bomb, the ultimate weapon that even he cannot disarm, and who it is used against, he in his ignorance confronts the English patient-a moment of irony. The villa, an island surrounded by a sea of turmoil and change, is not so remote that the \\"death of civilisation\\" cannot reach it.<br />The best of The English Patient reminded me at times of Mark Helprin (Winter's Tale, A Soldier of the Great War) in tone and evocations. While not a great novel, it is certainly an interesting, thought-provoking, and worthwhile diversion.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 21 May 2003.ross a desert-unless there were a Zerzura to be found.

US	52876068	R1ANT74PAHMWPP	0452274893	34033607	American Gothic Tales (William Abrahams)	Books	4	20	20	N	N	The dark side of the American psyche	American Gothic Stories ed. and with an introduction by Joyce Carol Oates. Highly recommended.<br />In this 1996 anthology, noted American author Joyce Carol Oates collects American tales of horror and/or the supernatural, from an excerpt from Wieland, or the Transformation (1798) by Charles Brockden Brown, to \\"Subsoil\\" (1994) by Nicholson Baker, so that the 50 stories here represent nearly 200 years of the darker side of the American psyche.<br />The stories, arranged in chronological order, show some clear trends. In early stories, by Brown, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and even Edgar Allan Poe, religion plays a prominent role. Interestingly, God and his creation are seen as at odds with one another. For example, in Hawthorne's \\"Young Goodman Brown,\\" the forest and the darkness are where Satan meets humanity. \\"The Tartarus of Maids,\\" an industrial creation of Herman Melville's, is set in a remote rural location, contrasted to another Melville story (not included here), \\"The Paradise of Bachelors,\\" set in a London gentlemen's club. Perhaps this conviction that nature is a place of mystery, evil, and fear, explains the early (and current) American drive to conquer it.<br />Another theme is denial of responsibility for one's own terrible actions. When called to account for committing some of the most heinous crimes possible, Wieland's defense is inarguable: He has proved his faith in God by doing that which God desired of him. (Unlike Wieland, the reader will recognise that the \\"shrill voice\\" expressing God's bloody will from behind a \\"fiery stream\\" is more likely that of the fallen angel Lucifer.)<br />A second example is the famous Poe story, \\"The Black Cat,\\" in which the narrator, noted from infancy for his \\"docility and humanity,\\" becomes a cold-blooded maimer and killer of that which he loves most. To what does he attribute his violence and subsequent fall in fortunes? Not to himself, but to the \\"Fiend Intemperance,\\" saying, \\"for what disease is like Alcohol!\\" While Poe, a self-medicating alcoholic and bipolar sufferer, seems to have had an early understanding that alcoholism is not a moral deficiency but a disease, his narrator's choice of scapegoat does not explain the obvious: Most alcoholics do not maim and murder.<br />In \\"The Yellow Wallpaper,\\" Charlotte Perkins Gilman also beats the medical establishment in recognising a pathological condition rather than a purely emotional one: Postpartum depression. Gilman gets her digs in at the predominantly male medical profession-the narrator's own husband, who makes every misstep conceivable in his attempts to \\"help\\" her, is a physician. Feminism and the gothic meet.<br />As the collection progresses in time, the stores become less religious and psychotic in tone, and some, such as \\"Snow\\" by John Crowley and \\"The Girl Who Loved Animals\\" by Bruce McAllister, are more science fiction than gothic. \\"Exchange Value\\" by Charles Johnson translates the tradition of psychological horror into inner-city terms. \\"Replacements\\" by Lisa Tuttle is telling commentary on the battle of the sexes; a literal vampire is preferable as an object of affection, attention, and obsession to the emotional vampire the human male of the story represents.<br />Other highlights include \\"The Veldt\\" by Ray Bradbury, which combines gothic sensibilities with science fiction; the unforgettable \\"Cat in Glass\\" by Nancy Etchemendy, in which the narrator's implausible reality is the only one that makes sense; and \\"In the Icebound Hothouse\\" by William Goyen, where erotic elements predominate.<br />A personal favourite, \\"The Lovely House\\" by Shirley Jackson, succeeds in evoking the surrealism of that most tangible and ordinary of places-a home.<br />In some cases, I wish Oates selected more obscure works of equal quality by the same author; for example, I wonder if there are any H. P. Lovecraft short-story alternatives to the oft-anthologised \\"The Outsider.\\" Still, it is innovative of Oates to include \\"The Enormous Radio\\" byJohn Cheever, who is not traditionally seen as a gothic writer-although \\"The Swimmer\\" might have been an even better choice.<br />With the exception of a handful of selections (most notably Oates' own \\"The Temple,\\" which is unoriginal and uninteresting), this is a rich, diverse collection. In the end, it does leave one wondering, What exactly is gothic? As helpful as some of the information Oates provides in the introduction may be, she offers few if any insights into the nature or history of the American gothic or the authors whose works are found here.<br />One quibble: I would like to have seen each story's year of publication included at its end, as is the case with many anthologies. Although the authors' birth and death dates are part of the contents page, some dates are mentioned in the introduction, and there is a permissions page with copyright dates, there is neither a comprehensive nor an elegant way for the interested reader to place each tale in its historical context-a serious deficiency in an otherwise excellent collection.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jean Rhys, troubled by the one-dimensional Bertha Mason in Brontë's classic Jane Eyre, or perhaps seeing an opportunity to take the depiction of Creoles out of the hands of English writers, decided to \\"write her a life.\\" The result is Wide Sargasso Sea, in which the Bertha Mason of Jane Eyre (Antoinette Cosway in Wide Sargasso Sea) finally steps out of the realm of caricature and becomes both human being and symbol. In the Norton Critical Edition edited by Judith L. Raiskin, several commentators expound on their views of what that symbolism means from a Caribbean, British, and feminist perspective.<br /><br />First, I have noticed that several reviewers mistakenly assume Antoinette is of mixed race (the modern assumption about what Creole means). In the context of the time, however, Creole meant a person of English or European descent living in the Caribbean. Rhys makes this even clearer with terms such as \\"white Creole\\" and \\"white cockroach.\\" This is an important distinction because it, combined with her French ancestry and poverty, sets Antoinette apart from the wealthy English and from the former slaves on the islands who are of African descent. That theme of having no home, no society, nowhere to go, and, essentially, being nonexistent, is integral to the storyline-and fits in perfectly with Bertha's role in Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Another important point is that Antoinette's mother (as well as her nurse) is from Martinique, a French island at a time when the French and the British were in bitter conflict. This makes Antoinette even more alienated from the societies in which she dwells but of which she is not a part. It's interesting to note that some of the academic commentators mistakenly attribute her mother's birthplace and the origins of the nurse Christophine (one calls her a Haitian, no doubt because of that island's strong associations with obeah) and even get Christophine's name wrong.<br /><br />Although there are parallels between Antoinette and Jane, between Antoinette and the Black child Tia, and even between Antoinette and her carefully unnamed husband (Rochester), this is a brilliant novel that does not depend on the reader's knowledge of Jane Eyre; like Antoinette herself, it stands alone. There are also many cycles throughout the book, including Antoinette's repeated dream. Antoinette's lack of identity is reinforced by Rochester's invocation of a principle of obeah; he calls her Bertha, a name that is not hers (this also emphasizes the predominance of an English identity over that evoked by the French name Antoinette). There are the clear dichotomies between Rochester and his England, where he is a disenfranchised second son, and Antoinette and her Caribbean, where she belongs neither to the wealthy whites or the freed slaves.<br /><br />Wide Sargasso Sea invokes the Bible several times. Rochester's father and older brother betray him to Antoinette's stepfather Mason for 30,000 pounds, alluding to the 30 pieces of silver that Judas Iscariot takes from the Romans for betraying Christ. There are numerous references to a rooster or cock crowing at key moments, as the cock did after Peter had denied Christ three times. The Christian allusions are intermixed with the presence of obeah throughout-just as the Christian faith and obeah beliefs from Africa became intermingled in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Reality and dream are equally inseparable. \\"Is England like a dream? . . . She said this place London is like a cold dark dream sometimes. I want to wake up.\\" The unnamed husband (Rochester) retorts, \\"Well, that is precisely how your beautiful island seems to me, quite unreal and like a dream.\\" Their erotic life is no less a dream. \\"I watched her die many times . . . Only the sun was there to keep us company. We shut him out. . . . It was at night that I felt danger and would try to forget it and push it away.\\"<br /><br />Rhys, saddled with the pre-determined ending of Jane Eyre, manipulates its foreshadowing and symbolism brilliantly. Rochester says, \\"I would give my eyes never to have seen this abominable place.\\" Obeah woman Christophine responds, \\"You choose what you give, eh?\\" In a return to the beginning, Antoinette, determined mad by an equally mad Rochester, burns down Thornfield Hall, just as her own childhood home was burnt by the freed slaves who held her and her mother in such contempt (\\"white cockroach\\").<br /><br />There are seemingly endless layers of meaning within the slight 112 pages of Wide Sargasso Sea, about ethnic and national identities, about imperialistic and patriarchical repression, about madness, and about the relative relationship between reality and dream. Ultimately, Antoinette reclaims her identity and reality through a dream-and with her death.

Not recommended.<br />Earlier in 2002, I had read Victorian Love Stories: An Oxford Anthology edited by Kate Flint, a wonderful, imaginative anthology that covers the gamut of love, from earnest and longing to the impulsive and painful, from gritty realism to the fantastic and the supernatural. I had had Nothing But You for a while, and it seemed natural to read it as a follow-up to the Victorian anthology. This proved to be a mistake;  the contrast between the two highlights the shallowness of the New Yorker stories.<br />There are a few gems, such as \\"Marito in Citt&agrave;\\" by John Cheever, \\"The Diver\\" by V. S. Pritchett, \\"Eyes of a Blue Dog\\" with Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magic surrealism, \\"The Kugelmass Episode\\" with Woody Allen's characteristic offbeat humour and angst, and \\"Here Come the Maples\\" with a touch of irony by John Updike. One story by a lesser-known writer, \\"In the Gloaming\\" by Alice Elliott Dark, stands out for beautifully conveying the tragedy of loss and alienation, not through death, but through the chains and barriers that life erects to prevent insight and truer love between the mother and son and between them and the distant, unloving father. Impending death finally begins to break down those barriers and reveal the humanity of mother and son to one another.<br />For the most part, however, these highlights are overwhelmed by the blandness of the rest of the selections. Somehow, this collection about \\"love\\" seems to miss many of love's elements-affection, depth of feeling, passion (depth of emotion of any kind), perception, dedication. Instead, many of the stories read as pointless, plodding, surface tellings of things that happen, with an amazing attention to mundane and unrelated detail, and revolve around featureless, interchangeable characters with no depth and no interest. \\"The Nice Restaurant\\" by Mary Gaitskill, with its generic yuppie characters Evan and Laurel, their meaningless relationship, and endless detail such as \\"Evan picked at his pork-chop bone. He downed his glass of wine\\" and \\"Laurel shifted in her chair\\" that is meant to convey the flat emotions of these flat people contrasts badly with the underlying passions and conflicts subtly portrayed in Lucy Clifford's \\"The End of Her Journey\\" and Hubert Crackenthorpe's \\"A Conflict of Egoisms\\" from the Victorian anthology. Later, the same cardboard characters, with different names, will appear in \\"Ocean Avenue\\" by Michael Chabon, where, nine yawning pages of yuppie angst over coffee later, the predictable happens.<br />How modern authors have reduced one of humanity's deepest, most elemental, and disturbing emotions into a painfully superficial detailing of everyday functions is, perhaps, a reflection of modern love and life. I would like not to think so, however. I would like to think that we are still capable of passion, even cartoon characters like Evan and Laurel and Chabon's California counterparts, Lazar and Suzette.<br />At the end of the Victorian collection, I felt elated, disturbed, empathic, inspired, and despairing.

Highly recommended.<br />John Cheever has long had a reputation as the quintessential American writer of the 20th century, and this collection, which he edited, is illustration of why he is a favourite of the American literati.<br />Cheever's stories are populated by mostly mundane people in mundane settings-the corporate executive and rising stars who go home every night to an affluent suburb like Shady Hill, with its unforgettable recurring cast of characters (the Beardens, the Farquarson, the Parminters) who live on such unforgettable streets as Alewives Lane; the New York City elevator operator whose life consists of going up and down all day and whose mind and imagination never leave their comfortable paths; other apartment building workers, half of whose lives are spent on the fringe of luxury and the other half in grimy poverty; the thoughtless affluent who cannot conceive of any other life; the downwardly mobile who have no choice but to lower their level of existence closer to that of their former servants and who cannot seem to grasp that things will never be what they once were; the social outcasts, like Mrs. Hewing, who is \\"kind of immoral\\"; the former duchesses and other members of the old European elite who wear their rags with grace while their estate homes crumble around them; the expatriates who fit in neither where they come from nor where they live; and the travelers who find tragedy awaits at the end of the trip with the death of their child-or even the beginning of the journey of their doomed marriage.<br />What sets the stories and the characters-and Cheever-apart is the surreal nature of so much of what happens in the course of these vignettes. Instead of addressing an addiction like alcoholism directly, Cheever tells of an ordinary woman who cannot stop listening to her neighbours as their lives, their arguments, their loves, and their passions are voiced over a new radio her husband has bought for her in \\"The Enormous Radio.\\" The birth and course of the affliction are seamlessly revealed through Irene Westcott's inability to withdraw from vicariously living through her neighbours' conversations. \\"The Five-Forty-Eight\\" reveals how an ordinary event-sexual relations between executive and assistant-can lead to the humiliation of a confident, secure man, who finds himself falling into the filth, while the disturbed and wronged ex-assistant is finally free of the demons he helped to feed while ignorant of their existence. In \\"The Swimmer,\\" which takes place on a Sunday where the recurring refrain is, \\"I drank too much\\" can be heard at every home, Neddy Merrill decides to go home from a party by swimming across the county through all the pools in between his host's home and his own-a novel idea taken to its surreal level as the weather and the trees change, and Neddy finds himself lost in a world where he knows what has become of himself but not how or why.<br />The world of John Cheever is primarily male; the vast majority of the stories are told by a man in the first person. The women whom they encounter range from their tired wives to their enigmatic lovers-and, in the case of the third of \\"Three Stories,\\" an enigmatic wife. Sex is central to many of the tales; the happily and the miserably married are in many cases equally open to sexual adventure and excitement if occasionally afraid of the consequences. It is the rare protagonist who would voice the thoughts of one incidental character: \\"After sixteen years, I still bite her shoulders. She makes me feel like Hannibal crossing the Alps.\\" (\\"The Country Husband\\")<br />It is fascinating to watch Cheever's subjects and style evolve from the 1920s and '30s to the 1960s-from an era of elevator men, fedoras, ubiquitous cigarettes, Martinis (with a capital \\"M\\"), and \\"affairs\\" to a time when \\"Artemis, the Honest Well Digger\\" can refer to the sexual act by its most unacceptable term and be whisked off to Washington, D.C., for making the mistake of falling in love in the U.S.S.R.<br />The surfaces here are untroubled, but the depths roil with repressed thoughts and emotions that are typical of Shady Hill and its ilk-but are neither acknowledged nor acceptable. Nearly everyone, whether they live in New York, Shady Hill, or Rome, is desperately seeking something-love, sex, passion, something-anything-to lift them above the towers of the city skyline where they work and the chimneys of the suburban trap they cannot-and really do not wish to-escape. An empty life is still a life of social acceptability.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />It seems that it's nearly impossible to talk about Middlemarch without mentioning its breadth and scope. The irony is that the entire novel takes place within the confines of this small community and within the sometimes-small minds of its various citizens.<br />Although a vast number of characters populate Middlemarch and its environs, each who speaks has a distinctive voice, yet does not fall into being mere type only. The horse dealer sounds like a horse dealer-but one with a particular background and perspective. The setting itself represents every type of town, suburb, village, or neighborhood where you'll find the complacent, the critical, the aspiring, the intellectual, the earthy, the wealthy, the poor, and the worker in between. As with many English novels, the setting, in this case Middlemarch, becomes as much a central character as any other, whether it's Dorothea or Lydgate.<br />The tapestry Eliot weaves is complex; one character's actions can affect the lives of others he or she may rarely meet, while the unknown behavior and works of Bulstrode in his youth decades ago eventually touch nearly all.<br />How the characters come together is sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle. Dorothy's interest in Causabon, although a puzzle to her friends and family, is painted in broad strokes to the reader; her later interest in Will Ladislaw, grows somewhat more delicately if based in the same altruistic roots. Mary Garth and Fred Vincy have, in their way, come together in their childhoods; they are still struggling with mutually agreeable terms that will allow both to acknowledge the love and affection that are already there. Lydgate and Rosamond are both more of a puzzle and less of one-a case of two opposed personalities with opposing views, opposing goals, and opposing personalities drawn together by that most capricious of matchmakers, proximity and circumstance, to form a union that will frustrate both and satisfy neither.<br />Against the background of these four sometimes difficult relationships (Dorothea and Causabon with its lack of love or eros, Dorothea and Will with the barriers set by Causabon's will and that of the Middlemarch society who frown on Will and Dorothea's association with him, Fred and Mary with her imposed restrictions to set him on the correct course in life before she can make a commitment to him, and Lydgate and Rosamond with their diametrical oppositions) is the long, happy marriage of Nicholas Bulstrode and his Vincy wife Harriet. Unlike the others, there are no visible barriers to their happiness, and they are happy as a couple-except for the events in Bulstrode's past that haunt him in the back of his mind and then at the front with the appearance of Raffles. The marriage survives the ensuing scandal, but the individuals-Nicholas and Harriet-become poor shadow of their former selves.<br />It is in a town like Middlemarch that a woman like Dorothea will find it impossible to find approbation for her plans and Bulstrode will find the antagonism of those who have come to terms with their own worldly desires. It is in a town like Middlemarch that merely the raving words of a delirium tremens-afflicted Raffles can upset the respectable work of a respectable lifetime. The downfall of Bulstrode validates the town and its modernizing secular culture.<br />Middlemarch is a novel of insight into personality, motivations, social behaviours, and history. In the end, even the happiest characters have failed at most if not all of their youthful aspirations and have become variations on the Middlemarch theme-husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, day-to-day toilers rather than dreamers and achievers. Middlemarch is Everytown, where you will find an example or two of Everyone-and their dreams or lack thereof.<br />If you intend to glean the utmost from it, begin with an annotated, critical edition; while Eliot enjoyed a high enough level of erudition to reference the current events of 1830s England along with mythology, religion, quotations, and developments in science and medicine, most of us today cannot begin to follow them without assistance. Knowledge of these references will enrich the rich text of a rich mind.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />He's egotistical, erudite, ejaculatory (literally), and explosive. He's \\"emptily verbose\\" (Merriam-Webster's definition number 3 for \\"gassy\\"). He's also that-gassy, a man with a flux. He's Ignatius J. Reilly, a monster of a man with a master's degree, a faulty pyloric valve, a love for Boethius and The Consolation of Philosophy, a hatred for modern life, a passion against anything to do with sex (at least sex involving a second person), and a distinctly lower-class New Orleans lifestyle. He's also a man about whom his own pet phrase could apply: \\"Do I believe what I am seeing?\\"<br />Set in the New Orleans of the 1960s, A Confederacy of Dunces begins with an incident with an overzealously inept policeman that leads Ignatius, one of the most unforgettable characters of American fiction, into a world with which he is unfamiliar and ill-equipped-work. As a result, he encounters a cornucopia of characters-from the cynical female owner of the laughably named \\"Night of Joy\\" to the wizened owner of the equally ill-named \\"Paradise Hotdogs\\"-who are as unforgettable as Our Hero. The most memorable is undoubtedly the generically named Jones, who, behind his dark glasses and his cloud of cigarette smoke, manages to see the world, its people, and the ironies of situation all too clearly. There are also Ignatius's wine-loving mother, his irascible neighbor, and \\"Myrna Minx\\"-the closest Ignatius has ever had to a girlfriend.<br />Ignatius, taken away from his magnum opus (written on a series of Big Chief tablets strewn everywhere in his room in his mother's house) and the modern movies he so likes to deride, touts the value of The Consolation of Philosophy and bemoans the work of Fortuna while attempting to leave nothing to chance. To feed his laziness and lack of desire to work, he works hard at being sly, devious, and manipulative. He carefully plans and plots his efforts from the perspective of a man who has little perception of human nature; the results are hilariously unexpected-the whims of Fortuna. In the end, Ignatius's life, such as it is, will never be the same thanks to his forced interaction with the outside world.<br />A Confederacy of Dunces will make you laugh out loud and, at the same time, you will probably detect an undertone of sadness, even hopelessness. As Walker Percy notes in his introduction, perhaps this is due to the knowledge that author Toole committed suicide. But perhaps it is equally due to the absurdity of modern life that the adventures of the larger-than-life Ignatius reveal at every turn.<br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Bill Bryson is known for his wry humour, and this is my first experience of it. Bryson gets it into his head to walk the famous Appalachian Trail. He is joined in this venture by Stephen Katz, an alcoholic, troubled, overweight friend who's an unlikely candidate as a hiker/mountain man but who, with his many foibles, adds a much-needed personal touch.<br />Bryson covers a lot of territory-literally and figuratively. He talks briefly about the birth and history of the trail, hazards that range from bears and lethal viruses to unforgiving weather and deranged murderers, the decline of forest species, acid rain, the maps developed of the trail, its disputed length, the shelters along the way, the Forest Service's love affair with road building, the National Park Service's love affair with inefficiency and mismanagement, the people they meet on the trail and off the trail in small towns and tourist trap cities, pack weight, food, and how what you do is walk. We also learn a great deal about Katz that make him both likeable and not at all likeable. I suspect he is someone who is interesting and funny to read about, but who is infuriating in real life. His nonchalance when Bryson is convinced there are bears nearby is a high point.<br />Bryson is charming, witty, aggravating, and snobbish. If you can see the humorous side of bureaucracy, small-town and rural America, and what was once known as Yuppiedom, you will appreciate his running commentary on  The downside of the book is that it hits an anticlimax shy of 2/3 through and never recovers. Perhaps this is symbolic of how walking the trail is.<br />This is not an Appalachian Trail \\"how-to\\" book, nor is it for the serious hiker or nature lover who expects to find out vicariously what it's like to hike the trail.

Highly recommended.<br />Rainy Mountain, a &quot;single knoll [that] rises out of the plain in Oklahoma,&quot; is an old landmark for the Kiowa people. It is a land of bitter cold, searing heat, summer drought, and &quot;great green and yellow grasshoppers.&quot; It is a land of loneliness, where the Kiowa were drawn after a long journey from the northwest through many types of lands.<br />The Way to Rainy Mountain is about the journey-in myth, in drawings by Momaday's father Al, in reminiscences, and in historical snippets. All reveal aspects of Kiowa culture, life, philosophy, outlook, spirituality, and sense of self-the beauty and the desolation, how the introduction of the horse revolutionized Kiowa life, the story of Tai-me, and the richness of the word and the past. It is a literal journey as well; Momaday, in Yellowstone, writes, &quot;The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.&quot;<br />This is a small gem of a book, beautifully written, illustrated, and designed. It has moments of insight, beauty, and sadness, as the ending of the Sun Dance, telling as the sun is at the heart of the Kiowa's soul-a soul that survives in every word and drawing of The Way to Rainy Mountain.<br />Diane L.

Scott Momaday's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel begins with his Tano protagonist, Abel, \\"alone and running,\\" yet \\"he seemed almost to be standing still, very little and alone.\\" He may leave to fight the white man's war in Europe. He may seek solace in the arms of a white woman or two. He may be sent to prison for a crime that he sees as a necessity. He may end up attempting to work in the industrial world. Yet Abel cannot run from the seemingly boundless, stark land or the traditions with which his spirit is bound. The land, as enigmatic as he is, is there at the beginning and there at the end. It is the constant in his life from and to which he runs. In biblical terms, it is the alpha and omega of his being.<br />I first learned of House Made of Dawn from an excerpt in American Indian Literature: An Anthology (revised) edited and introduced by Alan R. Velie, in which Abel encounters the \\"white man,\\" an albino Native who, although he appears only briefly in the novel, is one of modern literature's most compelling characters. Without saying a word, he emanates a vague menace with every look and motion. \\"Above the open mouth, the nearly sightless eyes followed the old man [Abel's grandfather] out of the cornfield, and the barren lids fluttered helplessly behind the colored glass.\\" You will never forget the white man. \\"A man kills such an enemy if he can.\\" The white man sets the tone for the rest of the novel.<br />Nor will you forget Abel's struggles, with his heritage and its expectations, with alcoholism, with his own body, with his own desires, his inability to find his place at home or in the modern white world, and with his emotional and physical pain.<br />There is the dichotomy of the prevalent Catholic faith, which finds itself oddly interwoven with Native belief in strange ways, as in the feast of Santiago held in Abel's town. The conflict comes to a head in Tosamah, Priest of the Sun, who reveals that \\"In the beginning was the Word\\" is all that we need to know of the essential Truth. But by adding and dividing and multiplying the Word, the white man subtracts the Truth-the Truth that eludes Abel. Tosamah says of his grandmother, \\"She had learned that in words and in language, and there only, she could have whole and consummate being.\\"<br />House Made of Dawn is much like the life and land it portrays-mysterious and unyielding.

Aron, Ph.D. Highly recommended.There is no end to the ways in which human personality types can be categorised. According to Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D., one of these categories, comprising about 15&#8211;20 percent of humanity, is the \\"highly sensitive person.\\" HSPs are individuals whose threshold for overarousal, physical or emotional, is lower than that of non-HSPs, although it falls along a scale. HSPs may be labeled \\"shy\\" or \\"avoidant\\" in school or society, when in fact they are really just trying to avoid the stress of overarousal. Aron is quick to point out that, while most HSPs are introverts, many are indeed extroverts. HSPs do not necessarily have better hearing, sense of smell, vision, etc., but their brains seem to process such incoming information at a different level. To a non-HSP, a rock concert or a casino is a loud, fun, exciting place to be. For an HSP, it is a loud, overwhelming, exhausting one that may require hours of aloneness and quiet to overcome the overarousal. According to Aron, the concept of the HSP is not mere psychobabble, but based on both psychological and physiological studies.<br />In American culture, and indeed in most Western cultures, HSP traits are generally seen as negative (hence, words like \\"shy,\\" \\"withdrawn,\\" \\"avoidant,\\" \\"inhibited\\").

Recommended.<br />Colette believed The Pure and the Impure was her best work. I can't judge, not having read anything of hers but a few short stories, but this collection of her observations about human attitudes toward relationships and sexuality is insightful and timeless. It is also difficult and obscure at times, perhaps because of the translation and because there is no real structure to such a collection.<br />Thanks to her milieu, her position in it, and her willingness to seek the story, Colette could draw upon the most interesting people of her time-the givers and the takers. From the older woman who publicly fakes an orgasm while self-pleasuring in an opium house to gladden the heart of her young, sickly lover to the rou&eacute; who exclaims of women, &quot;They allow us to be their master in the sex act, but never their equal. That is what I cannot forgive them&quot; to the circle of prominent women who learn the ways of sex from servants, dress as men, and love horses (she calls the most notable of these women &quot;La Chevali&egrave;re) to the &quot;happy,&quot; alcoholic, lesbian poet Ren&eacute;e Vivien to the gay men with whom she seems most comfortable, Colette covers a spectrum of sexuality and combinations-including those men and women who play their heterosexual and homosexual relations against one another.<br />&quot;I'm devoted to that boy, with all my heart,&quot; the older woman tells Colette, a stranger to her. &quot;But what is the heart, madame? It's worth less than people think. It's quite accommodating. It accepts anything. You give it whatever you have, it's not very particular. But the body . . . Ha! That's something else, again.&quot; Thurman believes this sums up Colette's view precisely, the heart as a slave to the body.<br />Although Colette apparently wanted to remain an impartial observer, she cannot mask her own feelings and biases. One senses that she could not quite see a woman-woman partnership as &quot;whole,&quot; as passionate, as capable of being the source of tragedy in the same way as other types of relationships. (Anaïs Nin will also hint at something similar in her diaries, at the &quot;incompleteness&quot; of female/female love.) &quot;What woman would not blush to seek out her amie only for sensual pleasure? In no way is it passion that fosters the devotion of two women, but rather a feeling of kinship.&quot; She is fascinated by the story of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby, the &quot;Ladies of Llangollen,&quot; who elope and spend several decades living together. During this time, Butler will keep an extensive journal about her life with &quot;My Beloved,&quot; while, to Colette's consternation and fascination, Ponsonby remains a silent partner. Colette so romanticizes the Ladies that she says they run off together as &quot;young girls,&quot; when in fact Butler was 39 and Ponsonby in her 20s. While there is all kind of detail about their living arrangements, from gardening, sewing, hosting an array of distinguished visitors, and sharing a bedroom and bed, there is nothing known of their emotional or sexual intimacies other than their obvious devotion to one another. They remain a happy, content enigma to Colette and to the present day.<br />The book concludes on a more personal note-about jealousy, &quot;the only suffering that we endure without ever becoming used to it.&quot; She maintains that &quot;a man never belongs to us&quot; and hints at the unique and not unfriendly relationship two female rivals may have-even rivals who wish to kill one another. When one rival tells Colette all the things that had prevented her from killing Colette in Rambouillet (missed train, stalled car, etc.), Colette says, &quot;I was not in Rambouillet.&quot; The relationship between her and her rival becomes more interesting, more revealing, more important, and moreaffectionate than with the man over whom they duel.<br />Colette suffered what many turn-of-the-century female intellectuals must have-a society's fear of &quot;masculine&quot; women who are too intelligent, too outspoken, too knowing. When she offers to travel with the rou&eacute; (apparently as a friend), he says in seriousness, &quot;I only like to travel with women,&quot; which, a moment later, is softened by, &quot;You, a woman? Why, try as you will . . .&quot; Even today, there are women who have experienced this.<br />&quot;This is a sad book,&quot; Colette said. &quot;It doesn't warm itself at the fire of love, because the flesh doesn't cheer up its ardent servants.&quot; Thurman adds, &quot;This great ode to emptiness was written by a woman who felt full.&quot;<br />The Pure and the Impure is a must read for anyone who enjoys Colette's other writings; it is the most autobiographical of her works.

Highly recommended.<br />It's difficult to believe how much Kazuo Ishiguro packed into this short (by today's standards), highly praised novel -- a lifetime of work and relationships, the realization of inescapable regret, and the hope it is not too late to join the rest of humanity.<br />Stevens is a butler for an English house that is no longer great, nor is it owned by the family for which it is named. His postwar employer is, instead, an American named Farraday; as a stranger will point out to him later, &quot;An American? Well, they're the only ones can afford it now.&quot; Farraday &quot;affords&quot; Darlington Hall by shutting much of the house down and using a reduced staff, which Stevens can understand, as the staff that would be available would not be up to his own high standards. When he receives a sad, lonely letter from Darlington's former housekeeper, Miss Kenton (now Mrs. Benn), and later is told by Farraday that he can borrow his employer's car for a vacation on the road, he weighs the opportunity and decides to take it for &quot;professional reasons&quot; -- to see if he can lure back the highly qualified Miss Kenton to her former position. During the brief journey, he spends much of his time contemplating what &quot;dignity&quot; in his profession means -- and whether he lived up to it. After a plethora of recollections about the late Lord Darlington during the prewar years and after his meeting with Miss Kenton, Stevens comes to two great understandings: he did not serve a great man as he thought he had, and, in doing so, he had missed a chance for love and fulfillment. His devotion to Lord Darlington has betrayed him, personally and professionally. &quot;I can't even say I made my own mistakes,&quot; he laments. &quot;Really -- one has to say -- what dignity is there in that?&quot;<br />This revelation does not come quickly or easily to either Stevens or the reader. Each anecdote that Stevens recalls to illustrate a point he wishes to make to himself -- the definition of dignity, how he upheld dignity by serving his employer while his own father lay dying -- subtly reveals how much he has shut himself down emotionally in order to serve. With each story, it becomes clearer that Lord Darlingon is an easily manipulated man, out of his league in world politics but insistent on playing the role of peacemaker -- even when it is no longer appropriate or wise. When his friendship with a woman leads him to firing two Jewish maids, it foreshadows his attempts to influence the British government into appeasing Hitler and the Nazis at any cost. He goes so far as to say that the U.K. should perhaps follow Germany's lead. &quot;Germany and Italy have set their houses in order by acting . . . See what strong leadership can do if it's allowed to act. None of this universal suffrage nonsense.&quot; Stevens unwittingly proves Lord Darlington's point for him -- he trusts Lord Darlington's judgment as blindly as any German trusted Hitler's, believing that &quot;people like him&quot; are too ignorant to make the decisions that must be made and following the great man contentedly -- and thus making a bad decision.<br />When it comes to Miss Kenton, here too his perception is kept in check by his need for professionalism and dignity. His repeated emphasis on their &quot;professional&quot; relationship and his desire to reconnect with her as a &quot;professional&quot; only highlight the extent to which he will go to suppress his real feelings -- and the very real possibilities that existed.<br />In life and love, Stevens realises he has been avoiding both. In the end, however, there is hope. After sending Miss Kenton home, back to her husband, Stevens turns to &quot;bantering&quot;; that is, engaging with people without resorting to pre-programmed professional phrases --in short, truly interacting with his fellow humans. &quot;After all, when one thinks about it, it is not such a foolishthing to indulge in -- particularly if it is the case that in bantering lies the key to human warmth.&quot; Indeed it does.<br />One doesn't have to be a butler in service to others to use the remains of his or her own day to look back and appraise where one went wrong and where there is still room for hope.

In a Dark Wood Wandering: A Novel of the Middle Ages by Hella Haasse. Highly recommended.<br />This historical novel has its own interesting history. It was written by a Dutch author virtually unknown in the United States, then an English translation was begun by a postal employee who spoke no Dutch. After his death, it was lost for decades in a closet. The final English translation was completed more than 40 years after the novel was written by a Chicago editor who also spoke no Dutch-but who did have the opportunity to get the author's approval.<br />In a Dark Wood Wandering: A Novel of the Middle Ages is the fictionalized account of the life of medieval poet and statesman Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, son of Louis d'Orl&eacute;ans and Valentine Visconti, nephew of Charles VI, known as the Mad King or the Well Beloved. The plot is historically accurate and linear, beginning with the time of Charles' birth (although not focusing on it) and using that occasion to fill in the historical and character blanks for the novice to French medieval history. Unlike other reviewers, I found the first 100+ pages a fascinating setting of the stage, during which the author succinctly conveys the familial, personal, and political relationships of France's houses, primarily Burgundy and Orl&eacute;ans.<br />Although it is clear from the outset that Philippe the Bold of Burgundy is the nemesis of a united France and Louis Orl&eacute;ans (his nephew, brother to Charles VI, and father of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans) is his less selfishly motivated, more trustworthy counterpart, the novel does not fall into the trap of black-and-white villains and heroes. Burgundy and his successors are not evil personified; they are men who know how to look out for their own power. Louis and Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, both flawed in their occasional lack of will and indecisiveness, in their own way look after themselves, but also attempt to keep France's greater interests in mind. The most poignant moment early on is a conversation between Louis and his insane brother during one of his rare moments of lucidity-and the ensuing reversion of power to Burgundy.<br />Charles is born into not only all the internal conflicts within France and the ongoing battles with England, but into a war he must wage lifelong with himself-the conflict between his poet's soul and his inherited role as a statesman and leader of the House of Orl&eacute;ans. A scholar at heart, he must lead his house against Burgundy and his men against the English at Agincourt, where he is captured. Held prisoner for 25 years in England, Charles uses the time to become one of the leading poets of the Middle Ages, yearning for ideals of love, peace, and beauty-the very things that have escaped him all of his predestined life. He will not find them upon his return to France, as he is once more swallowed by leviathan internal and external conflicts and the need for his skills as a negotiator/arbiter. He is, as he says in one poem, &quot;all rusted over with nonchaloir [nonchalance].&quot; Finally, he promises he will &quot;not disavow the deepest desires of [his] heart&quot; and &quot;no longer give [himself] up to the sin of unhappiness&quot;-a promise his position, his role, and the demands of political reality never allow him to fulfill.<br />The novel features an array of complex characters and their relationships and interactions, a compelling plot, a fascinating time in the history of England and France, and a spectacular background portrayed in brilliant colours as in a tapestry. Best of all, the novel is meticulously researched and as historically accurate as any fiction can be. Partway through the book, I realised that this novel could, if handled correctly, make a near-perfect epic movie.<br />In a Dark Wood Wandering has inspired me to look into the life and poetry of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, the history of Louis d'Orl&eacute;ans and Charles VI, incidental characters such as François Villon and AgnesSorel, and so much more.

Not recommended.<br /><br />Female coming of age. Female desire and sexuality. Feminism. Promiscuities: The Secret Struggle for Womanhood attempts to address these issues in the context of Naomi Wolf's own coming of age in the 1970s. The problem with this approach is that it is too personal (a weakness Wolf admits early on) to offer either much insight or value. The best it can do is provoke clearer thinking in the reader than Wolf is capable of.<br /><br />The stories are provided by Wolf and her circle of friends, who are for the most part middle-class, urban, and Caucasian. Much of Wolf's discussion focuses on her childhood/adolescence in San Francisco and her exposure to that city's counterculture ideas and sex industry-something that may resonate with women of similar backgrounds, but not with this lower middle-class, East Coast, small-town girl whose exposure to the sex industry came at the end of adolescence, not during childhood. (Unlike Wolf, I and my peers didn't walk past strip clubs every day, see genital fetishes sold in local stores, or know about \\"sex workers\\" before hitting double digits.)<br /><br />Wolf describes in detail such things as her procurement of birth control in preparation for the planned loss of her virginity to a \\"sweet guy.\\" She would have you believe she was thinking about when a girl becomes a woman, what makes a girl a woman, the ritual of becoming a woman, and the adult attitude toward teenage sex at this tender age while making this well-thought-out decision. According to her description of the event, which feels meaningless to her because of the way society disregards it, there is no teenage impulsiveness or passion involved-again, something that does not resonate.<br /><br />Wolf's primary point is that we were taught to believe, falsely, that females control sexual relations because males have uncontrollable desires, while we do not. Her exception to this teaching is, of course, valid. She hypothesizes that not only do females have tremendous desire, but that we are capable of a higher level of more prolonged desire and that we are nothing short of sexual deities. She illustrates this with a \\"history of the clitoris\\" (in which it is forgotten and rediscovered over the millennia) and of the extensiveness and sensitivity of the female sexual skin. She cites ancient wisdom that is no longer in practice or understood about male/female sexuality and relations; they understood sexual relations in a way we do not. Along the way, she occasionally makes valid points, for example, that all too often, parents of the 1960s and '70s abdicated their adult roles to pursue their own pleasures and that there is no real transition from girlhood to womanhood.<br /><br />In the end, however, her points rely too much on the personal anecdotes and on selected sources, that is, sources skewed toward her viewpoint. This is not an objective analysis of legitimate issues and theories, but an agenda that has little substance behind it. Wolf does manage to successfully illustrate the muddiness of sexual attitudes with the muddiness of her own thought. She is a barely adequate writer because she is neither a clear nor a deep thinker. Promiscuities is no more than pop feminism that adds little to what has already been written upon the subject other than Wolf's own narrow perspective and need to be more sexually charged than men-a need that her passionless relationships and anecdotes belie.<br /><br />If you really want insight into female desire and sexuality and what it means to become a woman, there are surely much more universal, fundamental, and emotionally and intellectually integral truths available than the weak mental ramblings offered here.<br /><br />Diane L.

Recommended.<br />Henry and June (from The Journal of Love) by Anaïs Nin is a portion of the writer's famous journal from October 1931 until October 1932&#8212;the year in which she met Henry and June Miller and fell for Henry's sensuality and June's mystery, a year of writing, lies, deceit, sexual awakening, introspection, psychoanalysis, and \\"love.\\"<br />Nin is an evocative, poetic writer, if not a particularly substantive one. Henry and June, edited from her journal to focus on Miller and his wife, is beautifully written but, in the end, is devoid of meaning to anyone other than the participants. She obscures the truth of how much she writes. If the journal is accurate, then Nin had mastered deception&#8212;she lies to her husband, to June, to Henry, to her psychoanalyst, to her lover/cousin Eduardo, to virtually everyone she knows, all seemingly in an attempt to hide herself from them, and perhaps from herself. She writes frequently of costumes, makeup, jewelry, nail polish and how one can put them on to create a new self. It quickly becomes clear that, despite the introspection of the journal, despite the psychoanalysis, despite her complete focus on herself and how she relates to those people in her life, Nin is no more self-aware by the end of the year than she was when she met Miller, and the reader can't be too sure, either, of where Nin ends and where the self-deception begins. When the obvious is pointed out to her&#8212;that she is still trying to find the \\"love\\" that she didn't get from her father&#8212;Nin accepts it at first, but denies it as she talks more and more to herself. And while she may grasp that her father's abandonment was harmful to her, she finds it easy to mistreat her husband, whom she portrays as psychologically simple and refers to as a \\"child\\" without relating how he might feel to how she felt about her father. She seems incapable of grasping the importance of another person's feelings, no matter who that other person might be.<br />Nin writes of spending entire days and nights with Miller, of going from him to Hugo, her banker husband, with no suspicion on Hugo's part. Hugo is jealous of Miller, although she repeatedly tells her journal she doesn't know why he would be. She writes of not wanting to hurt the soft, weak, emotional Eduardo, but continues her sexual relationship with him until he is bound to be crushed by her sudden decision to end it. She tells Eduardo about Henry, Henry about Hugo, and her psychoanalyst about all of them. She writes of having sex with three men in one day, ending with \\"What does that make me?\\" She does not want to know the potential answer to that question. She wants \\"experience\\" at any cost. She does not want to be hurt, but she hurts others freely. She believes she has deep insight into others, but does not understand at more than a superficial level what their thoughts and feelings may be. Much of what she attributes to the elusive, mysterious June are the shifting sands of her own personality.<br />Not having read Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, the book he was writing during the year of his relationship with Nin, it's difficult for me to say how accurate Nin's portrayal of him is. At times, she feels pity for him, for his weak eyes, for the mind-numbing work he does to support himself. At others, she describes him as \\"monstrous.\\" The sketch of Miller is less one of the man himself than of Nin's infatuation with her own perceptions. At one moment he is the ultimate sensualist; the next, he becomes a gentle romantic. She also enjoys him largely for his worship of her as a writer and as a lover. The relationship is less about the dynamics of their interactions than about her ego and her relationship with herself. Miller is never much more than a two-dimensional, ever-changing character&#8212;Henry Miller according to Anaïs Nin. While Nin's journal is certainly more thoughtful than those of most people, ultimately, it lacks the insight and depth that another writer could have brought to such an intense relationship. At the end, Nin and Miller are still strangers to the reader who has spent hours over dinner and in bedrooms with them. Perhaps it is Nin's amorality that gets in the way of any true intimacy.<br />Nin has somehow become a model of a woman's sexual awakening and awareness, perhaps because of the perceived candor of her journal and her desires for the depths and heights of sexual experience. It is as though such desires for such experiences are what should define a woman&#8212;a notion that may work for some women, but certainly not all who are sexually awakened in their own ways.<br />Henry and June is self-indulgent and even occasionally adolescent in its focus, obssessions, and attitudes. Perhaps because I find so little to relate to in Nin, I found her cold, uninteresting, and annoying&#8212;perhaps because I don't like to be deceived. On the other hand, this will be a fascinating read for anyone who is deeply interested in Nin or Miller or anyone, like me, who would like to free themselves to speak freely in their own journals.<br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br /><br />A classic novel made famous by a recent movie, The Age of Innocence is the story of a society man, Newland Archer, caught between two very different women. On the one hand is May Welland, the virginal Diana of New York society, whose seeming frankness and innocence discourage and oppress him: \\"Untrained human nature was not frank and innocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive guile.\\" All this is \\"supposed to be what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might exercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow.\\" Her counterpart is her cousin Countess Ellen Olenska, vaguely exotic, vaguely dangerous, forbidden-primarily because she is not the \\"artificial product\\" of society, but a genuine, sensual woman whose independent way of thinking is enough to tacitly and then overtly banish her from the very company that Newland's life is built around. She is \\"different,\\" as Archer will later discuss with one of his children. No one else would say, \\"Why not make one's own fashions?\\" thus giving a voice to what Archer himself deep down believes but can't put into practice.<br /><br />Ironically, it is May who first forces him and Ellen together, against his will, in her efforts to be kind to her cousin, who has just returned from Europe. As he sees more of \\"poor Ellen,\\" estranged from her emotionally abusive husband and seemingly vulnerable to the wiles of the wealthy outsider scoundrel Julius Beaufort, he finds himself returning again and again to her until he realises he is in love with her-long after the reader has reached that conclusion. He resolves the dilemma by rushing his marriage to May, which makes it that much worse. Thus ensues a delicate balance between the life he has chosen with May, with whom he now realises he has no emotional bond, and the life he would choose if he were more sure of himself, more sure that being true to oneself is more important than being true to one's system.<br /><br />Nearly every character is memorable-from the massive Mrs. Manson Mingott, May and Ellen's grandmother who is old enough and skilled enough to intuit all and manipulate all; to the womanizing Lawrence Lefferts, whose behavior is acceptable because he knows how to play the game, how things are \\"done\\"; to the frigid bastions of society, the van der Luydens; to May's mother, who cannot be exposed in any way to \\"unpleasantness\\"; to Archer's virginal sister Janey, who lives life vicariously through gossip and guesswork.<br /><br />Many scenes and locations are equally vivid: Beaufort's lavish house and party; the contrast of the van der Luydens' dinner party; Archer and May's conventional and stifling honeymoon, more sporty than romantic or passionate; Archer's pursuit of May in Florida and his following Ellen to the Blenkers' and then to Boston; a revealing ride with Ellen in May's brougham; Mrs. Mingott's house in the middle of \\"nowhere,\\" where she rules like a queen and where the politics are only slightly less complicated than those of Elizabeth I's court-all unforgettable places and scenes.<br /><br />In less intelligent or skilled hands, the plot could have become mere melodrama, but Wharton knows how her society worked, who inhabited it, what it forgave, and what it could not pardon. Affairs are pardonable; treachery, real or perceived, to the framework of what holds these people together is not. In the end, May saves Archer from himself-and dooms him to her kind of life by doing so. When he gives up all his dreams, he looks into May's \\"blue eyes, wet with tears.\\" She knows what he does not and remains cold as the moon that the goddess Diana rules.<br /><br />It could be said that May and Ellen represent two sides of Newland Archer-both are people he is afraid to become. If he is like May, he experiences death of the mind, death of the soul, death of the emotions, becoming what he is expected to be to keep the foundations that society is built upon steady, strong, and standing. (It is no coincidence that a theme in Wharton's The House of Mirth is the vulnerability of that house to the influx of modern ways.) If he becomes like Ellen, he will lose everything that he has built his own foundations on. In the end, he is neither, nor is he himself. His tragedy is not that much less than that of The House of Mirth's Lily Bart, both victims of a society they need but cannot survive.<br /><br />Diane L.

Highly recommended.<br />In Trail of Tears, John Ehle (who is, as far as I can tell, non-Native) sketches the people and events that led to the infamous Trail of Tears, the removal of the Cherokee Nation to &quot;Indian Territory&quot; (primarily Arkansas and Oklahoma) where they would &quot;never&quot; be bothered by whites again. The focus is on the &quot;Treaty Party,&quot; consisting of Ridge, his son John Ridge, and his nephews Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie, along with Moravian, Methodist, and other missionaries sent to convert the Cherokees to Christianity and who are caught up in Cherokee/state/federal politics.<br />Ehle's bias is evident in the title; the &quot;rise&quot; of the Cherokees is the effort, not wholly embraced by the Nation, of adapting to European-American culture, language, religion, and even livelihood (e.g., Cherokee hunting is uncivilized, whereas the adoption of American farming is preferable). The story begins with some background and the birth of a Cherokee man named Ridge not too long before the American Revolutionary War. The white impact has already begun to be felt, as one of Ridge's forebears is white, and he and his family are driven into the wilds by the war.<br />After the war ends, the new Americans have one craving-land and more land. A gold strike in Georgia adds to the fever. The Cherokee, along with the Choctaw, Creek, and other southern tribes, are perceived as &quot;wasting&quot; land that their white counterparts should be entitled to. From this point on, it is clear that the Juggernaut of American expansionism and greed will displace the Native peoples. The question is only how and when.<br />Meanwhile, Ridge, who will not convert to Christianity but who wholeheartedly adopts many white ways for himself and his children, becomes not only a wealthy plantation owner but a leader of the Cherokee Nation. His son becomes an attorney, while Boudinot becomes the first editor of the Cherokee newspaper, The Phoenix. Both young men marry white New Englanders they meet while at school. Ridge and his family and allies are the first to see the writing on the wall-that the Cherokees will be removed; it is a matter of whether it is &quot;voluntarily&quot; on their own terms in their own time or involuntarily.<br />The principal chief of the Cherokee, a Cherokee-Scot named John Ross, is portrayed as a man in a state of denial. It is never clear how he thought the Cherokee could overcome the overwhelming tide of white intrusion without bloodshed and without losing. He and his followers blame the Ridge faction for selling the Cherokee out when they sign the Treaty of 1835 that puts the seal on the removal. They feel that they can continue to &quot;negotiate,&quot; not realising that Andrew Jackson has set the tone and the terms-and that the federal government under his leadership has loaded the die. Ehle is no John Ross fan; when the inevitable finally happens and the Cherokee are removed, Ross sends them via the lengthy, dangerous, time-consuming land route, resulting in hundreds if not thousands of deaths (the number remains unknown), while Ross and his family use the quicker, less treacherous water routes.<br />There are several dichotomies in this history-the Upper Towns vs. the Lower Towns; the full-bloods vs. those with white ancestors/family; the uneducated (mostly full-bloods, according to Ehle) vs. the educated (John Ridge, Boudinot); the federal government vs. state government (a dichotomy that would be resolved violently through the Civil War). A forest/mountain vs. town dichotomy is also evident. In any case, anything that speaks of the way the Cherokee used to be is seen as &quot;primitive,&quot; while Cherokee adoption of white ways is lauded by their neighbors. In fact, this is seen as the heart of the problem; the Cherokee people are pliable, are willing to adapt, are willing to live like the whites-and in the end are treated no better than their Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole counterparts. Ehle includes much contemporary commentary on this particular irony.<br />This book has been said to be controversial because it shows the wealthier Cherokees, like Ridge, John Ridge, and John Ross as owning African slaves. The Cherokees tried to marry their own ways with that of the European-Americans; they had always had slaves, usually captives from other tribes. But it is clear that the majority of Cherokees were poor, did not own plantations, and did not exploit slaves.<br />Trail of Tears is an excellent snapshot of a particular situation and will be eye opening to those who are not familiar with the story of the southern tribes and their interactions with the burgeoning American population. Ehle includes a wealth of primary sources, such as letters, journal excerpts, military orders, and the like, that serve to enrich the story. This history lesson is told in a story/fiction format enhanced by contemporary writings that keep it interesting, lively, and personal. Ehle's biases are clear but do not detract from this book as a history of a moment in time when the fate of a nation was decided. This is an excellent supplement to any broader history of the Trail of Tears.<br />Diane L. Schirf, 29 April 2001.nd are treated no better than their Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole counterparts.

The sadness, tragedy, ugliness, and despair are laid on so thickly as to become improbable in combination. Bad things do happen to good people, but in McCourt's world, the worst always happens. When the family moves, it is to the worst house on the lane, next to the only outhouse. When it rains, their house is the one that floods. When he develops conjunctivitis, it is permanent (he still has it years later). When other kids' alcoholic fathers go to England during the war to earn money, his is the only one who drinks his pay away and loses the job. Nothing is ever halfway for McCourt. If there is a tragedy to tell, it will be the most tragic conceivable.<br />There are inconsistencies, such as time frames that make no sense, as well as improbabilities, like his grandmother making several walking round trips of over a mile, all in one night, months before her death. There is also the issue of whether McCourt could possibly recall such detail (as his lengthy story about the IRA refusing to helping his father out and why) during his very early years without any context. It would be as though you were four years old and heard your father talking about the New Deal, and you remembered everything about it even though you had no idea at the time what all the acronyms represented. Oddly, while McCourt goes into great detail about his early childhood, his timeline becomes increasingly compressed as he approaches adolescence. There is much less detail, and whole months are passed by just at a time when a person would be more likely to remember more -- and to be experiencing more. It almost feels like he grew tired of the tale (and fabricating it) and was in a rush to get to the end. Or perhaps, having gone through a sleazy conception, rats, fleas, sewage, open sores, tuberculosis, vomited blood, corporeal punishment,<br />prolonged hunger, his mother's prostitution, etc., etc., etc. (no horror goes untouched), he simply ran out of material.<br />So, from early on, I viewed Angela's Ashes as a work of fiction in which none of the characters is likeable. While many would say the father is the worst, as he is a hard-core alcoholic who cannot and will not support his family, I found him to be far more sympathetic a person than his mother as portrayed. When sober, the father often shows his sons small signs of affection and empathy, but Angela herself is nearly always cold, distant, and unsympathetic toward her children. She is always more focused on herself than on them. I'm not sure how many people could write about their own mothers as dispassionately as McCourt does. If she had one good quality, McCourt is careful not to present it.<br />As a child, McCourt seems relatively balanced, likeable, and ethical, wanting to do the right thing, but adolescence seems to turn him into a different person. He lies, he steals, he takes advantage of people -- and the only guilt he seems to feel is that imposed by the Catholic Church. There is never a sense, even when he achieves adulthood, that he has any deep thoughts about who he is, what he is doing, and how he affects others. Even his agonizing over his belief that he is responsible for a consumptive girl's descent into Hell because he had sex with her is tainted by the selfishness of his focus.<br />In the end, I must concur with an author acquaintance who said, &quot;Angela's Ashes? 'tis as phony as the photo on the cover.&quot;<br />But it is certainly well written and compelling, if you happen to have a large grain of salt handy.

H. Lawrence is a sequel, but knowledge of The Rainbow is not necessary to appreciate the second novel. The title is somewhat misleading, as it is really about women and men, men and women, and men and men-and it's not always clear with what they are in love. It is the tale of two teachers, sisters Gudrun and Ursula Brangwen, the son of the local mine owner, Gerald Crich, and school inspector Rupert Birkin.<br />Their complex relationships start to take shape the day of Gerald's sister's wedding, as Gudrun and Gerald and Ursula and Rupert are drawn together, often despite themselves. The Gudrun/Gerald relationship becomes a series of conflicts that are won only temporarily and that lead to more conflicts and then temporary reprieves of tenderness and sex. His emotional conflicts with Gudrun are mirrored in Gerald's dealings with animals; he brutally forces his mare to stay at a railroad crossing despite her terror until blood is drawn and until the cars have passed. Later, when his sister's rabbit resists being picked up so he can be sketched, Gerald punches him in the head so he will submit instantly. His blind will must triumph in all. The only time that he and Gudrun seem to find an equilibrium is when they balance each other by accepting but not gravitating toward each other. It becomes a tenuous relatonship at best and a dangerous one at worst. Gerald is incapable of love, as is his brooding mother.<br />Meanwhile, Ursula finds herself in a different kind of battle, with Rupert and his self-contemptous philosophies about relationships, death, and the will. His vision of love, if he even believes it exists, is of two planets circling one another in perfect equilibrium. He did not find that with his former lover Hermione, who does not satisfy his physical desires and who does not calibrate with his spiritual needs. At the end of the novel, he reinforces what he has said all along-his love will always have a missing component and be incomplete without it. As a side note, Rupert seems to be Lawrence's own mouthpiece, reflecting many of his own views.<br />As with Lady Chatterley's lover, the setting for Women in Love becomes a character-the grimy village, the sordid town, the sullen miners and their wives provide a backdrop of inevitable modernization and dehumanization that counterbalances the individual stories. As mining is mechanized to death, so is the human soul. The will either accepts the inevitable crush of the modern world or fights it to the death. The weakest part of Women in Love may be when the setting changes, that is, when the couples decide to leave all that England has become and to take their relationships and their futures to the Alps, where they find art truly does imitate life with its mechanism. The novel seems to lose a little of its footing at this point, giving in to its tendency to become an intellectual exercise in the arts rather than a human story in a regimented world.<br />Women in Love starts out slowly, as a lengthy series of vignettes and conversations that seem unlikely or unrealistic, but develops a crescendo as the battles begin. In the end, despite dramatic events and drastic changes, the conundrums remain, and even Ursula's persistence and will cannot eliminate them now, let alone forever. Women in Love is about destruction and regeneration in an endless cycle and the human under the surface that we are not entirely aware of and cannot express.ithout it.

US	52876068	R3DIGA381875YP	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	4	55	68	N	N	Worthy of Arthur	The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley is a retelling of Arthurian legend through the eyes of the women surrounding Arthur. This sounds simple enough, but before this one is over, you'll need a scorecard to remember who is kin to whom and how. Once you figure that out, you'll want to learn more about the effects of inbreeding, since there is plenty of it here.<br />Viviane is Lady of the Lake and of Avalon, a mystical island that only those with the Sight can find in the Mists; to those not gifted, it is merely an island with a Christian church and monastery. Taliesen is the Merlin of Britain, the messenger of the [Druid] gods. Viviane's half-sister and Taliesen's daughter, Igraine, is married off to Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, and in due course gives birth to a daughter, Morgaine. She also is foster mother to her younger sister (half-sister) Morgause, a teenage girl who has the combined gift of great ambition and little conscience and who will play a key role later. The young Igraine resents deeply how Viviane manipulates her, first into marriage with the much-older Gorlois. Later, Viviane's prediction, which Igraine also resents, that Igraine will fall for Uther Pendragon, comes true. Uther becomes High King after the death of Ambrosius, Gorlois rebels against him, and Igraine conceives Uther's son, Gwydion, or Arthur, the night before Gorlois' death. Arthur, as we know, is fated to become The Once and Future King in the Matter of Britain.<br />The story is not so much about Arthur or Morgaine as about the struggle between paganism and the rise of Christianity, with Arthur as Christian king and Morgaine as pagan priestess. Arthur is installed in a pagan ceremony that leaves Morgaine pregnant with his only son, Mordred -- who in this rendering never plays quite the key role assigned him in other Arthurian tales. The plot points pretty much follow the tradition -- Arthur marries Guinevere, who has an affair with Lancelot, who ends up married to Elaine. Meanwhile, Viviane is killed, leaving a void in the office of the Lady of the Lake -- an office that will be filled, more or less, by another daughter of Taliesen.<br />Bradley's sympathies toward the pagans (the feminine) are evident as Morgaine takes over Viviane's mission of trying to turn Arthur and Britain away from Christianity (the masculine) and back toward the Goddess. As the tale progresses, however, Morgaine becomes an increasingly ruthless and unsympathetic figure, while Arthur appears to be doing what is expedient for Britain; he even manages to make peace with and convert several Saxon kings. Morgaine is too single-minded and fanatical to listen to the counsel of the Druid who becomes Merlin after Taliesen's death, Kevin, and eventually punishes him for his &quot;betrayal&quot; of the Goddess.<br />In the end, Arthur may die, but his legacy was already set, as many had already told Morgaine. She leaves her own legacy -- a trail of the murders and the deaths of nearly everyone important to her, including two of her lovers and Lancelot's daughter. Only at the very end does she realise she has lost; Christianity has won. Perhaps this was the way the Goddess wished it, after all, although the price she pays to learn this is very high indeed. She also learns that she has always had the love of a great man, the man who was son, brother, and lover to her -- Arthur, King of the Britons.<br />The Mists of Avalon is a worthy addition to the Arthurian cycle, especially since it takes into account what must have been a very real struggle between the old pagans of Britain and the new Christianity of Rome. The plot is intricate and imaginative, the characters are well drawn (if erratic), there are a few moments of subtlety and beautifully written prose, and there is enough fantasy to make one wonder if there really is a supernatural intervention throughout. Even the lost continent of Atlantis is worked into the tale. Highly recommended for Arthurians and fans of science fiction/fantasy. But don't forget that scorecard.tion/fantasy.

It is Clifford's hometown Tevershall and the surrounding coal district. His home Wragby stands where the great Nottingham Forest of legend once dominated the landscape. Now it is coal -- mines, colliers, colliers' shanties, colliers' towns, and, most of all, money and ennui. It is dead, as seen through the eyes of Mellors and Connie -- dead, lifeless, and grim, slowly sucking away at what is left of humanity and of human tenderness. The only idyllic place is the remnant of the Forest where Mellors is gamekeeper, and even it reeks of the smell of coal and of money and of the folly of money. The colliers and those who command them, the Cliffords, are soulless, dead, and, tellingly, impotent in the most important ways.<br />D. H. Lawrence has a unique voice and tells this tale in a unique way, albeit heavy-handedly in places. His characters' sermon-like conversations are sometimes hard to swallow as realistic. But the frustrations and the spiritlessness of the people are real enough and save the novel from becoming too much of an intellectual exercise or a diatribe. I found myself wishing for the more subtle touch of a Victor Hugo in Les Miserables, another novel in which a human story is told against a larger setting, or even of a Tolstoy, but this is more of a story-in-a-box -- a limited box. Recommended if you can suspend belief a bit; if you are looking for a good story rather than a great one; and if you are looking not for puerile pleasure in Lawrence's liberal smattering of &quot;naughty&quot; words, but for a place to begin start asking the questions. There are no answers here, but there is the foundation for a beginning.	2000-12-28
