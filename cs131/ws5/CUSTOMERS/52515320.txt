It does have a good set of reference photos, particularly for the historian and modeller, as the Prinz Eugen had somewhat of a distinguished career being a partner to the Bismarck and a A-bomb Test bed for the USA.  It does lack good line drawings and interior detail for the Class which I would expect for the price.	2001-10-20

A relevant language considering Kohl served on U-boats and a gifted artist, and Rossler a historian. I won't go into the history of the whole u-boat war as this book doesn't, read the two volume history of the U-Boat war by Blair Clay Jr. for true insight. <br />This volume covers a basic history, but unlike the usual volumes, does not contain the technical data one would expect and has a somewhat melencoly presentation of a great weapon that was never given it's opportunity to shine as a comerce raider against unarmed merchantmen. A great deal of time and photos are dedicated to bomb damage to construction yards and unfinished u-boats by US and UK bombers. <br />The line drawings are as usual excellent, and one is somewhat disappointed by the lack of overall expertise in presentation we expect from this wonderful series. In all, a good buy as a collectable, but if you are not, get a cheaper option.	2001-08-21

Downs (Conway's History of the Ship)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Sailing history written by its' participants	The majestic age of sail, the large tall ships bearing up to seven masts in the later 1800's to the second world war is an age that everyone with an interest in the sea loves. Great ships that plied the world with coal, wool, tea and timber in direct competition with the steam ship. Unlike the warships such as the victory of Constituion they required small crews as the evolution of the industrial age saw the use of 'Donkey engines' to lift the enormous sails in minutes in comparison to days by manual labour. How do I know this? I bought this wonderful book. <br />Unlike the rest of the series, it is written by men of sail, not hostorians, and even the traditional line drawings are explained. When you peruse this book you can hear Greenhill and Manning argueing with each other about the way it was back &quot;then&quot;. <br />The book contains the history of the tall ship as a cargo carrier, the history of this ship as well as line drawings and photos that would make Beken of Cowles drool.<br />A wonderful coffee table book even though it was never meant to be one.	2001-07-26

The Bellona was famous for the sinking of a French vessel of similar proportions in its' first engagement. The Bellona then went on to serve for 54 years, a considerable service history keeping in mind most ships lasted about 20.<br />The book itself covers (as usual) the history of this vessel and its' type, and has great photos of Models in the National Maritime Museum in the UK. The line drawings are aimed at the scratch builder, so good is it's detail. If you have seen any of Lavery's works you know to expect only the best. The rigging and running rigging is all set out as well, but strangely, no belaying plan, which I would haev expected in a book so detailed.  Hard to find and well worth having.	2001-07-21

There are numerous photos and some history, but you buy a book like this for the line drawings, which, as usual are unsurpassed. <br />Almost impossible to get, there are a lot of cheaper alternatives, but it's like investing in a Rolls in comparision to a mass produced Hyundai.	2001-07-18

Not that most people would be particularly interested in the every single detail of this particular type of torpedo boat, it's just really well written. By far the most passionate of this series.<br />This type of boat was mass produced both in kit form in the US and in the UK. It was a coastal defender and also a long range rescue boat for downed airmen in WWII. The complete history of the boat, as well as the fate of every vessel. Excellent photos and line drawings that are the signature of this series. Every major variant and perfect for a scratch modeller.	2001-07-18

The Hood was the pride of the Royal Navy, and like the Titanic, unsinkable. Until it was sunk by the by the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen. Why, because the deck armour was too thin. Anyway, this book was a revolution in detail, published first in 1982. It tells the story of the ship, then has many photos, and as the benchmark for the series has wonderful line drawings of every aspect of the vessel. <br />A collectors item that is worth hundreds in first edition, but the new revised editions are somewhat more reasonable.   <br />Sensational.	2001-07-10

The vessels carried two huge mortars, and, as Tomahawk cruise missiles are used today, the bomb vessel was used in the fleet for specific purpose. As it typical with this series, it depicts a famous ship, and in this, Goodwin is lavish in his history (he is really surpassed by no one in regards to British naval history apart from LAVERY). Excellent photos of a model from the National Maritime Museum and line drawing details that are really wonderful and very comprehensive. All the frames and beam are depicted, planking, masts, rigging and sail usage. This is a wooden ship, scratch modeller's, dream.	2001-07-08

Over 500 of this class were built for the US and Royal navies. Lots of Photos of the different variants but the drawings are unfortunately no where near as detailed as some of the others in this series.

Whilst no records really exist of this vessel it is somewhat of a generalisation in its' line drawings.  When you compare this to the fantastic details Marquardt goes into with `Endeavour' and `Beagle', particularly in respect of rigging, as such I find this book quite disappointing. Lavery does do good research and his history is impeccable, I still would have liked to have seen more detail in his drawings.	2001-07-05

Based on the A type submarine class that served the Royal Navy for nearly 40 years, The Submarine alliance goes into incredible detail. If you have ever seen inside a submarine it is an amazing jumble of pipe, wires and gauges encapsulated in a tiny cylinder.  This book depicts how it all works and is more like an engineers manual than the typical Anatomy of the ship book. Every system is drawn in detail, from the ballast tanks, how the pipes go through the ship, to the gauges that control them. Even the batteries are drawn in cutaway. This is the most intricate of this series in have seen.	2001-07-05

The detail again for this series is outstanding, even down to the sidearms worn by the sailors. <br />I think the thing that really got to me about this one was a true italian touch, with the amount of detail given by the ships designers to accomodation, particularly to the officers.<br />Wonderful work yet again. like any of this series, they are all collectable items	2001-06-28

I have looked high and low for a book of this quality, and it was worth the price. It also contains a comprehensive list of the ship models held by the National Maritme Museum in Greenwich, UK, and the purpose and history of ship models through out the ages.   In particular, it gives the ship modeller a fresh perspective on different types of models you can achieve, and how striking effects can be achieved with half models, frames, dioramas, cross sections, single cannon pieces and other unique items.<br />Remember, Great Britain was the dominant navy in the age of sail, and their museums hold the best records of those ages. Add this to your wish list, and if you can afford it, buy it and display it for all to see.	2001-04-17

New to the hobby, DO NOT BOTHER!<br />This spiral bound collection of vague descriptions, terrible photos and worse presentation (I think it has been photcopied not printed)has been compiled by some of the greatest modellers of all time.

Whilst it has a few nice pictures, it is just that, a picture book, and not for the serious enthuiast. It consists of many frequently published photos and a few artist's renditions to fill up space.<br />From the first truely famous British warship, the Mary Rose, to the HMS Victory, graduating to steel vessels, Dreadnoughts and to great battleships such as the Yamato and the American Iowa class ships; It only provides a brief Synopsis of a bygone era.	2001-03-24

Somewhat different to most other publications, this 300+ page, 40cm x 40 cm tome covers most aspects of rigs around the world for the period metioned. The beauty of Marquardt's works is his artwork. <br />Every imaginable 19th Centruy rig is presented and diagrams displayed, but do not be fooled, it is not a picture book and mainly consists of text, but well woth finding and owning.<br />Of similar vein, if you can purchase one of his Anatomy of the Ship series, you can see how painstking Marquardt's works are. <br />Are their more user friendly books around for the modeller? Yes, but one can invest in an artwork such as this book or one can read a paperback.	2001-03-13

As a westerner, the biggest mistake would be to call their brutality evil, it was their way. <br />TAIKO explains the mindset of the Japanese Samuri class that condoned the slaughter of so many POW's in WWII. Brutality ruled, and it was a man's world. The survival of the fittest and strict rules of war. This was fine in the 15th century, but the Samurai class carried it to the twentith and thank god they were crushed.<br />It is worth the read for that understanding alone.	2001-02-03

The largest of the Anatomy of the ship series, the detail is mindboggling. The immense vessel truely depicts the stupidity of war, that large brute force will win the day. <br />The scale of this ship, and the detail in this book is nothing but intimidating. This is almost twice the size of the great US battleships, and to even contemplate building a model, do not even waste your money unless you had this works, and even then, when you see the amount of diagrams in this book, it will either put you off as you may not think you can do it justice, or you will spend at least a year trying to get it close to detail.	2001-01-24

I am going to embark on making the HM bark Endeavour next, and this resource has every detail I imagined. In particular, I was interested in the lashing of small boats to the deck, and it even had a wealth of information on that. <br />Everything makes sense, even Ray Parkin's wonderful works on the Endeavour is not as detailed. In some respects Marquardt and Parkin contradict each other, even though they used the same reference, but both are well read and their arguements good for their interpretations, the ship is gone, and no-one will ever know. It is lying in the mud in an American river.<br />Very hard to find, but well worth tracking down. As of 2001, this 'Victory' has been re-released as has 'Yamato' in this series, and they are also both well worth owning. This makes the trifecta.	2001-01-16

The author has done this by pictures alone. Page by page, step by step, rope by rope, a revolution in this type of instruction. Every page depicts a new, full page diagram on the rigging of ships.<br />As far as this type of genre goes, I am yet to see a publication that can match this, and as such the new bench mark, instead of the usual tome of exhaustive text for people who have lived on boats their entire life.<br />I have given it four stars as it is based on only one British ship. I can understand and appreciate the author's brilliance in his ability to filter down such a complex subject, but for the price, I would have liked to see a greater variance of ships and an inclusion of small boats, but this does not lessen nor detract from this books quality.	2001-01-08

It really only brushes over each subject. What it really needs is a step by step example, be it photos or diagrams, as I am yet to find an author that really does it well. You purchace a book on techniques, you expect it to be step by step, with demonstrations, not generalisations.<br />It has good photos of wonderfully made models, but it is about planking, not showcasing a mate's work. It is a difficult subject, that could have been done so much better. Why not show differing clamps, homemade and commerical, the ways to bend the planks not a paragraph of description, demonstrate how to do the dowels, not a paragraph, that is why people buy these books, to learn.	2000-10-19

I loved his last 2 books, and keeping in line with a thinking plot, he has included some legal argument, but aiming at action and detail. It is so nice to see an American author who can get away from jingoism and stick to a plot. <br />Well worked caracters without padding like Clancy, action without patriotism like so many others, including the most realistic and transparent views on the views of American/Israeli political relations that can be intelligently and maturely couched without being anti-semetic.<br />Once again, HUSTON has a workable idea, the ability of the US to declare war on an individual or an organisation, not just a nation state. Everyone is effected by terrorism, even if it is higher petrol prices, and as is shown time and again, the US, whilst it has the world's greatest military, is hamstrug by a political inability to commit to the destruction of terrorism in the name of religion.<br />I wonder, if it was not for oil in arabia, would the west really care? Authors would have to find a new bad guy, like multi national corporations, but no, they pay for elections and politicians.	2000-10-14

Other links from my reviews will take you to far better books for the hobbiest.<br />It took three months for the good people at Amazon to track this down, and I think a far more honest review may have saved my purchacing it.

The beautiful sepia  colours of his art and majestic sailing ships of the bygone era are not  done justice by the tiny reproductions in this work, considering its' cost.  <br />At 8&quot; x 5&quot; it is almost too small to be a coffee table book.  <br />Anyway, the book displays the famous yachts of the era from the 1880's  to pre-WWII with small dialogs before each chapter to explain the stage and  history of sailing at Cowes in each era, from the turn of the century  (1800-1900), pre-WWI, Post WWI, pre WWII.

Not much in the way of  written explanation, but covers every aspect of the sailing ship, from keel  to sails.  I would have liked to have seen more colour plates of the  wonderful B&amp;W photos it contains.  I believe that it is aimed at the  intermediate model maker, so don't buy it if you expect this to teach you  how to make model ships, but merely as a companion. It is a dictionary of  ships diagrams, well worth owning and adding to the collection, with other  works such as 'The Ship Model Builders Assistant', 'The 100 gun ship  Victory', 'Anatomy of Nelsons Ships, and 'Ship Modelling Simplified'.	2000-08-16

His hand drawn pictures in these works were made whilst in  Custody under threat of execution if seized.<br />Before the war, PARKIN was a  professional sailor, after the war he studied as a classical artist, and  worked on the wharfs of Melbourne as a tally clerk.<br />This description  meets his works, his love of the sea, his artwork throughout the works, his  beautiful descriptions, and his exacting detail.<br />The first novel is of a  shipwreck survivor, it doesn't show it, but he is the hero portrait, it is  a TRUE story. The second is a diary of his captivity on the Burma railway,  and the third of his captivity in Japan, including the dropping of the  A-Bomb. 'He states that a newspaper dropped in by air to Japan when he was  first released has three momentous events, atomic weapons, jet propulsion  and ball point pens'.<br />His works are not bitter, if anything appreciative  of having lived a life less fortunate. Very Australian in it's style and  language, it is as moving as any of the recognized greats. I will not wax  lyrical about its style further, the editorials above do so far more  eloquently than I could.	2000-08-09

Yes, it is basically a dictionary, but if you are after a good reference, get the 'Ship model builders assistant', or go  the whole hog, 'Anatomy of Nelson's ships'. It contains little in the way  of diagrams, and is very limited in its variance of ships.	2000-08-02
US	52515320	R2UYMYJEDT5TOR	0870210777	793792831	The Anatomy of Nelson's Ships	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Wonderful Reference	If you are passionate about modeling ships, or merely an afficianado of ships of a bygone era, this is the grandaddy of reference books. <br />First published in 1950, and written before the modern kits and tools available  today, it surely slakes the thirst for knowledge that those of us that love  the tall ships.<br />Yes, it mainly visits the HMS Victory, but its' detail  were the primary reference for McKay's 'Anatomy of the ship - the 100 gun  ship Victory', owning first editions of both now, one could never give them  away.<br />If you are like me, you will spend countless hours lost in this  book.     <br />It starts with the basics of how a ship is built from the keel  up, with many photos and diagrams of how to lay a keel, frames, planking  and decking, not so much a modelers reference, but an explanation why. It  goes upward to the best detail I have ever seen of masts and yards,  enlarged enough to see how to scratch build them.<br />It has numerous photos,  drawings, and pull out diagrams of every aspect of the Victory, but it is  standard reference for the tall ship.<br />I would not say if this is the only  book you ever buy on ships, buy this, it is not that type of coffee table  book. It is one for those who appreciate the knowledge and the craft, and  to proudly put amongst your collection, and never give away.	2000-07-31

I think this is what Robert Crowley was trying to achieve with 'What If?'. Every turning point of history is here, including the personalities and maps, and Durschmied's journalistic style makes it easy reading, avoiding  the historian's intellectual snobery.  From Troy to Vietnam, he gives  plausable alternatives, and identifies the crux of each battle without  pages of rambling. As a journalist, he encapsulates the moment, this is  what makes this book so facinating to the layperson. One for every history  buffs collection.	2000-07-21

One of those moments in life when you have the opportunity to purchace a masterpiece. re-released in 1999, it comes in two large books, one full of large plans in a folder, all  deserving of framing.  The log of this vessel is included in the second  part, from its' inception, construction, crew and history of the journey  that mapped the east coast of Australia. If you ever wanted to make a  wooden ship model of a truly amazing vessel in a time of adventure  equivilant to any Wilbur Smith, this is all you will need. It could never  be surpassed, as the author is obviously one of those men who is truely  dedicated to his art. The anatomy of the ship series should be so good!	2000-07-21

When it comes to plastic ship modeling, this is the most comprehensive  title available.  It covers the basics from the keel up. It instructs on  the use of photo etch materials and the scratchbuilt replacement of most  parts of model ships.<br />It gives painting techniques as well as dioramas.  It really is the quintessential reference for ship modelers.	2000-07-09

Read the other reviews for the story, I can recommend this book on the following provisos; A) You want something different  B) you don't want to have to concentrate on plot  C)  You accept the inplausable  D) you get value for money (that it is long  enough to have you reading it for a number of days, not a flimsy 200  pages)<br />Read it and enjoy the further development of COBB's characters.	2000-06-13

Books	3	0	3	N	N	Get to the point	Whilst interesting, it fails to expand on possibilites and rambles on about &quot;what really did happen&quot; (ie; true history). I see here the potential for a true masterpiece that fails to follow through. Personally,  I would have liked to see future projections, not a rehash of history as it  did happen.	2000-06-02

Approximately 50% of the book is a sycophantic promo for special forces, including deafeningly wooden dialogue, and the other  half has a good plot (mind you it has been done before by Dimicurio). If  you are an avid fan, wait for the soft cover, because you'll feel  disgruntled paying full freight for this for an author that has been rushed  by his publisher. 2.5 stars	2000-06-01

Probably only of interest to us down here, but it does contain some truisms that was America in the 1950's. The book is written from transcripts and reports that were only recently released from  the Secrecy Act (ie: 25 years after). No great surprises, but it does show  the level of paranoia shown in Australia that was sweeping the country in  refection from the USA's MaCarthism in the 50's. It also shows how the US  and UK intelligence agencies did not trust us because of leaks.  Interestingly enough, they were later revealed to have come from the UK's  MI6 'advisers' given to us. <br />Twenty years on, we can look back at how  gullible we were, and how we were too isolated to take any great part in  the northern hemisphere's cold war.	2000-05-27

He speaks for a nation that allowed itself to be  subjected to such barbarity, and only to become resigned to it because of  the generations the reign of terror it covered.<br />To a police officer in a  democrocy, to hear that such barbartiy took place (no, not isolated  incidents)on a scale so vast (16,000,000) persons imprisoned) as slave  labour is so hard to imagine. I do not think anyone could have conveyed  its' truth so powerfully.<br />If you read one book of intelect in you life,  let it be this	2000-05-26

As a writing style this is fine, but this time he stopped about half way, (with no indication of sequel). <br />One buys a techno for escapism, so I won't comment on inplausibilities, it is not the point of reading his books. <br />If young Eric reads Amazon.com reviews,  please give your loyal readers an indication of what is next (PS, what  happened to Australia, we get your books here as  well).<br />greg_lester@hotmail.com	2000-05-03

But history books examine personalities not hardware like Bergerud. It is nice to see (once again) an unbiased view of the South pacific and its' war. For a lover of  detail I love to see an American that is prepared to critisize yet praise  his nation. No rambling monolgue of the Clancy biography series, just facts  and history.	2000-02-09
