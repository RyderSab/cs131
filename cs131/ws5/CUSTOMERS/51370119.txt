Anyone with enough savvy can get someone to output money for  some product or service that they don't really want or need.

I began answering that voice by purchasing this book.<br />Three  years later, I can look back, satisfied that many negative attributes and  influences I used to carry with me have been extirpated from my being.  While I am nowhere near my final destination of the road to achievment, I'm  simply a lot better than I was before.<br />There are an unlimited number of  tools available for those who seek personal and professional development.
