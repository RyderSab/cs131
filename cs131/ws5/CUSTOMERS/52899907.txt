The publisher is Publishamerica, with a website at [...]  For the life of me I could not figure the company out, although admittedly I only spent a half hour browsing their website.  They solemnly proclaim that they are not a vanity press or POD for authors' to finance their own printing but I remain suspicious.  The cost was $19.95 eligible for free shipping from Amazon, all in all a bit steep.  The book is a standard trade soft cover with 198 pages, with stories actually beginning on page 13.  The cover is an atmospheric red and black photo of some woods, what I guess are in fact the real Gretchen's Wood.  I would call it nondescript, neither detracting from nor enhancing the book.  There are 11 stories here.  Either they are newly published or else they have been extensively revised for this book, as is explained in the useful author's introduction.  Production qualities seem standard.  I do not know if the book was edited by anyone.  There are a fair number of minor typos, more than I am used to seeing in such a book, but nothing severely egregious like HP Lovecraft Institute.  I think this has to do wtih how Publishamerica works with its authors.  These were not a major distraction.<br /><br />The only thing I ever read by Ran Cartwright was his story about Azathoth in issue #1 of Dreaing in R'lyeh.  It did not move me at all when I read it a year ago and I only found out about it again as the magazine was mentioned in the brief bio on the backcover (albeit as Dreaming of R'lyeh).  I went back to it today to confirm my impressions after slogging through this book.<br /><br />I really don't get these books with the intent of panning them.  I want to like all the mythos stories I read.  Alas sometimes it does not happen.  I guess a tipoff about what you are getting into is the fact that 4 stories use the word horror in the title, a direct nod to HPL's The Dunwich Horror.  All the old mythos tropes are trotted out here: people don't laugh, they cackle.  In the first several stories whippoorwills are prominently mentioned.  Shrill piping echoes everywhere.  Everyone and their brother seems familiar with mythosian books and entities.  Copies of musty old tomes abound.  Everyone seems to not just lose touch with reality but to go stark raving insane with the greatest of ease.  And they all are studying obscure cults.  Just about every tale features a chanted Ia Ia.  (To prospective authors I just say get your ia ias out!).  Well, I suppose that's OK; I think most fledgling mythos authors start out with heavily tributory stories before branching off on their own paths.  And I still enjoy a good standard mythos story.<br /><br />The biggest difficulty I had was that I was not impressed with the prose.  Read a story here, then pull out Horrors Beyond and reread \\"One Way Conversation.\\"  The differences are stark.  In Gretchen's Wood the characters are paper thin, undistinctive and ultimately forgettable.  Their motivations and actions were contrived or incomprehensible.  They did not relate to one another in any believable way.  Frankly I don't think giving them surnames, or in some cases middle names, was necessary.  It sure didn't lend depth to the story.  Not much here ventured off very standard mythos plotting.  There are a few new mythos entities introduced, which many authors like to do but doesn't do much for me.  I really only liked three things about this collection.  First, the rich detail about Columbiana County added much needed depth to the book.  Obviously Mr. Cartwright knows this area well.  Second, the best parts of each story was generally the action sequence near the end.  The build up, however, was in general arduous and uninvolving.  In fact \\"Black Horror of Dungannon\\" was a disorganized mess, but the final shoggoth attack was a decent read.  Third, in my opinion the best story was reasonably good, \\"Dreaming in Darkness.\\"  The most direct antecedent to \\"Dreaming in Darkness\\" was \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" by HPL.  Of everything in the collection, this story had the most clever plot, the best characterizations and the best dramatic tension.<br /><br />So I can't really recommend this book.  I kept setting it aside and only managed it in drips and drabs.  On the other hand it is vastly preferable to A Darkness Inbred or Nightmare's Disciple, and maybe falls close to Island Life or Other Nations on my ratings scale.  I can think of some fans who would like it: those readers who are new to the mythos and still have a very strong preference for conventional knockoffs that don't cover new territory and don't stray from the usual plot tricks.  You know most of us were at that point at one time or another.  Some fans won't even consider a story mythos if it does not contain these elements.  Those of you who will get a book for one decent story might do so for \\"Dreaming in Darkness.\\"  This is why I still don't completely deride Cthulhu and the Coeds, which contains \\"The Scrimshaw Museum\\".  And some fanatics need to buy everything, which is, I guess, why I got it.  As usual I would be interested to read differing opinions.The most direct antecedent to \\"Dreaming in Darkness\\" was \\"The Whisperer in Darkness\\" by HPL.

US	52899907	R2H99CNXJOD299	0974878995	426928207	Tales Out of Dunwich	Books	5	35	39	N	N	Come revisit with your old friends, the Whateleys...	Tales Out of Dunwich is a newly released book from Hippocampus Press.  \\"Dunwich Dreams, Dunwich Screams\\" by Eddie Bertin is newly published with this book.  Otherwise the remaining stories have all been released before.  I have a pretty extensive library of mythos books and anthologies, but not of periodicals, and almost all of these stories were new to me.  \\"Acute Spiritual Fear\\" by Robert Price was in the 2003 collection Disciples of Cthulhu II from Chaosium and \\"The Black Brat of Dunwich\\" was in Stanley Sargent's 2002 The Taint of Lovecraft from Mythos Books.  Tales Out of Dunwich is a handsome trade paperback and costs $20.00.  Although not discounted you can get it from Amazon where it is eligible for free shipping if you buy $25.00 worth of merchandise, but for downgraded shipping.  Production qualities seem first rate.  The page count is a generous 302...but this includes 9 pages of title page, table of contents, dedication and acknowledgements, and Robert Price's 4 page introduction.  Yes, the editing and introduction are by the ubiquitous Robert Price.  He nicely lays out the premise of the collection, which is to build on the previous Dunwich Cycle on the Chaosium label, with stories related to, inspired by or set around HPL's \\"The Dunwich Horror.\\"  Price being Price there is an overly erudite and, well, irrelevant discussion of the editing and authorship of the Bible. Ehhh, maybe not so irrelevant when we get to his own story he chose for this anthology.  What I mean by overly erudite is that Price spends what seems to me an inordinate amount of time doing serious literary analysis on trifles.  I remember in the movie The Kids Are Alright Roger Daltry telling a reporter something like \\"Rock and roll can't stand up to all that inspecting and detecting.  So shut up.\\"  Or more to the point, I like to paraphrase a Shoe cartoon, where Shoe is talking to the Perfessor.  This is only as accurate as my foggy memory allows.<br /><br />Shoe: Whatcha reading Perfessor?  Some science fiction junk?<br /><br />Perfessor (suddenly incensed):  Junk?!  Science fiction is not junk!  These authors are highly original and imaginative!  This is not junk!  This is philosophy, heavy, mind-expanding philosophy!<br /><br />Shoe: So what's it called?<br /><br />Perfessor: The Feast of the Khroobles.  It's about a giant meatloaf that eats Toledo.<br /><br />What I really would have liked, but only got from Bertin, are authors' notes about the stories.  The cover art, by Phillip Fuller, shows a very bosomy brunette, dressed in Goth chick dominatrix outfit, with a come hither look, holding an ancient leather bound tome, no doubt the Necronomicon, with an ancient gabled house concealed mistily in the background.  Need I say it has nothing at all to do with any of the stories?  It sure isn't a picture of (deformed, albino) long suffering Lavinia Whateley.  In fact it looks like the teen dream of a bespectacled loser who reads horror and fantasy, and comes uncomfortably close to the sort of picture that would have made the book fly off the shelf into my hands several decades ago before I started compulsively acquiring mythos titles.  Maybe that's the point...<br /><br />Spoilers may follow, so don't read any more if that will bother you.  I will also level some harsh criticism at some of the stories, but let me say at the outset that I highly enjoyed this collection.<br /><br />Harper Williams: \\"The Thing in the Woods\\"  This novel (novella? What's the difference anyway?) comprises the bulk of the book.  Per Price this was one of Lovecraft's direct antecedents for \\"the Dunwich Horror\\" in terms of setting, prose and the plot device of two mysterious brothers and their odd mother.  As such it is of historical interest to the mythos fan but is not a mythos title at all.  It is quite a find but only really necessary to the mythos completist.  It fits in perfectly with Hippocampus' publication goals, which is to rediscover and disseminate books that were in HPL's library.  Visit [...] for more details.  The mysterious monster here is actually a lycanthrope, with nary a tentacle in sight.  Two things stand out.  First of all Williams was better at prose (but not cosmic concept) than Lovecraft, with more interesting and developed characters, and better dialogue.  The story was well paced with tension well developed, even if it wasn't very scary.  The second is that Williams' 1924 racism is particularly virulent and spiteful, making Lovecraft's own tendencies seem positively genteel.  The politest phrase used for blacks was a racist epithet.  Other more vicious epithets appear.  And the depiction of the one black character is quite derisive.  This was so matter of fact in the text that it was positively jarring and will no doubt make many modern readers squirm.  I am including this comment in my review because it might give some readers second thoughts about buying the book.<br /><br />Jack Williamson: \\"The Mark of the Monster\\"  This story is from 1937, is non mythos, is not set in Dunwich and has perhaps a tenuous connection to HPL, perhaps.  Or perhaps none at all.  It could have easily been deleted, as it was also the least accomplished prose in the book.<br /><br />Nancy A. Collins -  \\"The Thing from Lover's Lane\\"  I am unfamiliar with Collins' work.  Maybe someone could fill me in about whether she has any other mythos titles to her credit.  This was a story tangentially related to Dunwich, set in the Misty Valley as opposed to the Miskatonic.  Dunwich is mentioned in passing as a similar setting where weird things happen.  Definitely this is a mythos title where a girl is impregnated by an outr&eacute; being, namely an avatar of Shub Niggurath (not the more Dunwichian Yog Sothoth).  Interestingly in this story Shub Niggurath avatar is depicted as a male goat creature, instead of the more usual female.  The prose was well crafted and the story enjoyable.<br /><br />Robert M. Price: \\"Acute Spiritual Fear\\"  Price is well known to mythos fans.  Usually I don't like Price's writing but this is perhaps his best story, with a great premise.  At good ole Miskatonic University there is a cult that views Wilbur Whateley as the second coming.  After all he had a supernatural father and was despised of men.  Of course they are not too interested in the common good...The prose is quite good, the plotting deft and overall was top notch.<br /><br />Stanley C. Sargent: \\"Black Brat of Dunwich\\"  Stanley Sargent has many published mythos stories.  A lot of Sargent's earliest mythos stuff seems pastiche-esque to me.  This particular story, however, was very good.  It was an original take on \\"The Dunwich Horror,\\" casting poor old Wilbur as well meaning and misunderstood, and Armitage as a crazy evil coot, all as related years after the horror by Wilbur's now elderly tutor.  As in most of Sargent's fiction there is a strong homoerotic element.  Sometimes in Sargent's stories this particular theme is shoehorned unnaturally into the story, just because he wants it there in a very 80s kind of in your face gesture.  But is \\"Black Brat of Dunwich\\" it is a more organic element of the story and may explain the tutor's long standing loyalty to the Whateleys.  However it bugged me that this tutor was trying to get the interest of a young teen Whateley (granted 7 feet tall, inhuman, alien, goat like with extra eyes and tentacles, but the tutor seemed to think he was just human).  The illustration of this scene in The Taint of Lovecraft makes it look even more explicit.  This is not the first such image from Sargent.  For example consider the sheriff's brief mental image in \\"The Paladin of Worms\\" from Ancient Exhumation +2, which was quite gratuitous to the story.<br /><br />Brian McNaughton: \\"The Dunwich Lodger\\"  McNaughton wrote the excellent collection The Throne of Bones, ghoulish instead of Lovecraftian.  He had an accomplished hand at prose and evocative imagery.  This was a terrific little story of eldritch goings on in a seedy family in a seedy motel in Dunwich.  There is a good ghoulish denouement.<br /><br />Richard A. Lupoff: \\"The Doom that Came to Dunwich\\"  Lupoff is a well published author of horror and science fiction.  He has several mythos titles to his credit, and I'm sure these are due to be compiled in the upcoming Terrors from Elder Signs Press.  His story \\"Dingbats\\" in Horrors Beyond was not mythos.  In this particular tale an undecayed Whateley (only a Lovecraft fan will understand the reference!) returns to Dunwich years after the horror to find that those crazy locals are still trying to draw Yog Sothoth's attention.  I really liked this story.<br /><br />Don D'Ammassa: \\"The Dunwich Gate\\"  Don D'Ammassa is also widely published.  For example, his excellent story \\"Dominion\\" appeared in New Mythos Legends, the 1999 collection from Marietta Publishing.  A traveler accidentally ends up in Dunwich, and falls into the middle of the ongoing conflict between those who want Yog Sothoth's gate opened and those who desire to keep it closed.  Another excellent story.<br /><br />Gerard E. Giannattasio:  \\"The N-Scale Horror\\"  This is my first encounter with Gerard Giannattasio's fiction.  I want him to do more mythos fiction!  Especially like this highly original and highly enjoyable work.  A young man into model railroading makes a scale model of the Miskatonic Valley Railway.  It includes a scale model of the Whateley estate....<br /><br />Eddy C. Bertin: \\"Dunwich Dreams, Dunwich Screams\\"  Eddy Bertin is a new name to me.  This is his homage piece to Lovecraft, with HPL's fiction mentioned in the text explicitly as fiction (usually a plot device I don't like).  It is set in the original Dunwich in England, and is a story within a story about a tourist paying homage to HPL's Dunwich's namesake village, and the fate of the original Dunwich centuries before when it fell into the sea.  Some of the story is fiction centered on Dagon and some of it actually happened to the real Dunwich way back when.  One of the main characters in the flashback is named Sarah Lovecraft, although it is not explicitly stated whether she is an ancestor of HPL.  Maybe it was just another part of the tribute.  I look forward to more of Mr. Bertin's fiction.<br /><br />That's about it!  For the mythos fan there are many good stories here, making the purchase worthwhile.  However the racism by Williams (Hippocampus is trying to preserve historical influences on Lovecraft himself, and, for what it's worth, this was one of them) and brief allusion to adults and teens by Sargent may prompt some readers to pass this title by.

I read to them every night.  Previously they had very much enjoyed the other Dimwood books and so when we saw a new Poppy book we naturally got it.<br /><br />While I have liked Avi's other works, this book was something very special and is clearly my favorite of all the Dimwood books.  The characters should all be familiar to Avis's many fans who have been following his Dimwood Forest adventures.  Poppy is happily settled with Rye and her 11 children in Mr. Ocax's old tree stump next to Ereth's log.  But all is not idyllic.  Somehow or other middle age has snuck up on Poppy.  She has a teenaged son named for Rye's brother, Ragweed.  To distinguish him from the original Ragweed they call him Ragweed Junior, or Junior for short.  And Junior is just a little more than Poppy can handle.  He seems distant, surly, rebellious; she has lost touch with him.  His conversation is full of phrases and idiom that he has heard about in stories about the original Ragweed.  He has a new best friend, a skunk named Mephitis (what a clever name!).  Junior has colored his fur with soot to look like a miniature skunk and has Mephitis spray him with stink so he, well, stinks.  Even Uncle Ereth can't talk sense into him.  Poppy and Rye are completely baffled.  Into this impasse steps Lilly, Poppy's sister, who comes with an urgent message that Poppy's father, Lungwort, is ill and their old home, Gray House, is being threatened by a bulldozer.  Will Poppy go adventuring once more, to return home and confront her old fears (her father) and face a new one (the bulldozer)?  Of course, or we would not have had a story.  She and Lilly depart, and she decides to take Junior to try to reconnect with him.  Well Junior demands that Mephitis be allowed to go and Ereth decides he needs to follow to protect Poppy.<br /><br />The stage is now set for wild adventures, including a confrontation with a bear and the climactic encounter with the bulldozer.  And throughout Avi weaves his magic with touches both clever and poignant about parents and children, and what is the meaning of a family.  Do you want something other than what you have?  Maybe someone is envying you.  Perhaps understanding skips across generations.  Maybe you can come home again and then return to the new home you made on your own.  My sons were thoroughly charmed, thrilled by the adventure, amused by Junior's fur colors and gasping with laughter at Ereth's swearing.  And in some ways this was a gentler book than previous Dimwood adventures.  There were no scary death scenes here.  May I add that as usual the generous number of Brian Floca's illustrations were a joy?<br /><br />This is a wonderful book for young and old.vi weaves his magic with touches both clever and poignant about parents and children, and what is the meaning of a family.

As usual Mythos Books advertising is pitiful, as I just sort of stumbled across it.  It is a very nice quality trade paperback.  At Amazon it is $13.60, eligible for free shipping if you buy $25 worth of books, although with slower delivery.  The cover has a handsome noir type painting of Legrasse with a superimposed femme fatale looking type.  It is by Ben Fogletto, who was, I think, the artist for Mr. Henderson's occult detectives book.  There is an even more noirish sketch of a world weary Legrasse on the frontispiece by Erica Henderson.  Alas there is no other interior art by her, which would have been very welcome.  Page count is a generous 217.  In the back are advertisements for a number of books, including the forthcoming Black Sutra by DeBill (big yawn factor on the cover art) and Unholy Dimensions by Jeffrey Thomas (pretty cool looking cover).  The book's contents consist of HPL's \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", the classic which of course introduced us to John Raymond Legrasse, and 6 additional stories by Mr. Henderson, who brings Inspector Legrasse to life for us.  All stories are listed as copyright 2005, which evinces some sloppiness on the part of Mythos Books.  For example, \\"To Cast Out Fear\\" appeared in Eldritch Blue (was that released in 2003?) and \\"Patiently Waiting\\" was in The Occult Detectives of CJ Henderson from 2003.  I do not know if the rest of these stories already saw print elsewhere somewhen.  The introduction is by Bob Price, and is only mildly annoying.<br /><br />Of course Mr. Henderson's mythos credentials are impressive and I have certainly read numerous stories of his.  Although it is unwise to peg an author, it is safe to say that noir type supernatural detectives are a favored genre of the author, as evidenced by his Teddy London series, his occult detectives book and his Anton Zarnak stories.  With such highly honed skills, Henderson's stories almost always deliver the goods.  The premise of this book is to flesh out Inspector Legrasse as a character.  This is fertile ground for a mythos author.  After all, what did HPL provide to us beyond a name?  He gave us a sketchy first adventure but HPL just wasn't an action writer or a character writer.  He gives us a brief glimpse of the horror in the swamp.  The situation was just begging for someone to come fill in the gaps.  Thankfully, the talented CJ Henderson picked up the challenge.  All of these stories (except, perhaps, the last, \\"Nothing to Fear but Dust\\" which benfits from knowing the series background) may be read independently.  I am presuming, given the problematic copyright listing, that they were written over a number of years and appeared here and there before until compiled for this collection.  Where was I.....?  OK, there is an overall arc to the story collection leading up to Legrasse's ultimate confrontation with the Cthulhu cult.  Characters introduced in one story will show up in subsequent ones.  As Legrasse struggles to make sense of what happened in his first Cthulhoid encounter he becomes more and more detached from the normal course of human affairs.  He is a somewhat tragic figure, setting himself to fight monstrous evil but completely out of the public view, unknown and disregarded by the people he is saving.  It takes all of his reserves of character to maintain his equilibrium as he finds out more and more about Cthulhu, the Great Old Ones and mankind's place in the universe.  But he perseveres, knowing in his heart that humanity is worth preserving, that people of good will must set themselves against this horror at whatever cost, even if it only delays the inevitable.  Along the way he makes friends with Anton Zarnak and develops a small circle of devoted followers.  All stories are highly crafted and enjoyable in a way different from HPL's magnificent \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\".  HPL provides the cosmic sweep and Henderson the human dimension.  Approach this book in the spirit of the noir types detective stories of the 20s and 30s and you will be very satisfied.  Don't look too hard at how a few men can mow down a charging mob of Deep Ones with handguns, or at how sketchy the secondary characters are, or how untrained men, including the elderly, the out of condition and the morbidly obese, can navigate across the terrain of the Himalayas.  Such quibbles will only spoil your enjoyment and are beside the point anyway.<br /><br />So in summary, The Tales of Inspector Legrasse is a fine book, practically self recommending.  It will offer many enjoyable hours of reading to any mythos fan.  Based on this my next book will be The Occult Detective of CJ Henderson.dimension.

I never read his other novel, Skin Medicine.  He has written two short stories I saw recently, \\"The Eyes of Howard Curlix\\" (from Horrors Beyond) and \\"The Chattering of Tiny Teeth\\" (from Warfear).  Both were well crafted and enjoyable.  The limited edition hardcover of Hive is sold out (I was lucky enough to get a copy) but the trade paperback is available for only $10.85, and eligible for free shipping if the total order is more than $25.  My copy was rather more expensive, but it is a high quality hardback that upholds the high standards set by Elder Signs, and I imagine the paperback is good quality as well.  Page count was 269.  I must mention that the cover art by Dave Carson is phenomenally gorgeous, a shoggoth-like creature arising from the icy depths in an ancient ruined city.  However I would mildly contend whether it represented any actual scene from the book or was more just a terrific Lovecraftian painting.  Editing was tight with minimal typos (especially compared to the disastrous HP Lovecraft Institute).<br /><br />This book is billed as a sequel to \\"At the Mountains of Madness.\\"<br /><br />Sequel: n.<br />1. Something that follows; a continuation.<br />2. A literary, dramatic, or cinematic work whose narrative continues that of a preexisting work.<br />3. A result or consequence.<br />In the sense that it is set in the same environment of the Pabodie expedition, it is a sequel...relying on definition #1.  But I would dispute the aptness of definition #2.  I'll come back to that.  Be advised that some spoilers may follow.<br /><br />The plot is set in the modern era at a scientific research station in Antarctica.  The cast is a collection of scientists, technicians and other misfits who are spending the Antarctic winter doing research, basically cut off from the rest of the world and living in a small oasis in the midst of a harsh and unforgiving landscape.  Some of them are investigating areas previously searched by the Pabodie expedition in ATMOM and the unearth some frozen/mummified Old One cadavers...or are they really cadavers?<br /><br />I really really wanted to like this book.  And I did like the basic conception of the plot and how it was carried out.  Otherwise I had some difficulties with it.  This may read a little like stream of consciousness, alas.  First of all, although Curran used the same setting as ATMOM, and the machinations of the Old Ones were central to the story, it wasn't really a sequel.  I haven't read ATMOM in a few years, but as I recall were not the shoggoths ascendant in the ruins of the Old Ones' city?  Shoggoths did not make an appearance in the book.  But that's OK.  I think we would all rather an author followed his own muse and not just slap together another Lovecraftian pastiche.<br /><br />Part of my indelible response to any Antarctic horror story is informed by John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" (no, he's not a relative, the John Carpenter I'm related to is a commercial artist).  I think this movie is brilliant: frightening, creepy, hysterically funny in parts, with great acting performances and very very Lovecraftian sensibility.  I view it as the best ever Lovecraftian film.  And so I can't help but look for similarities, and I can't help but find them.  Curran himself makes a tributary mention of \\"The Thing\\" near the end of his text.  Having seen this and Alien, I must say there were no highly original plot twists in Hive to sustain tension.  But on the other hand, as it is set in the same frame of reference as ATMOM we already knew about the bogeymen, so I wasn't put off by this either.<br /><br />And now we come to my greatest issue with Hive, the writing itself.  The prose just did not knock my socks off.  I should note that the idiom made no effort to mimic HPL's prose (which is not a bad thing!).  ATMOM is one of my all time favorite HPL works and it was only about a hundred pages or so.  Word count in ATMOM runs about 41,000 and we know that HPL did not use the most economical prose.  Hive was just too long.  For the most part I think the mythos has been best served by the short story.  The mythos type novels that have really grabbed me have been few: Radiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk by Goodfellow, Rules of Engagement by Tynes and Balak by Rainey.  Most of the others have not been as good for whatever reason.  In Hive I often felt the whole book should have been edited down to novella length to remove excess verbiage.  For example, there were often, for me, excessive adjectives in oddly structured usage.  Back when I was a teen I actually read about 5 or 6 John Norman Gor novels, you know, the ones before he degenerated into soft core bondage porn, and he would structure sentences like *and too, to me it seemed bold* instead of the more direct *it seemed bold to me*.  Of course Yoda type sentence structure (beautifully lampooned in George Lucas in Love) is even more annoying.  I'm getting off track, there was nothing that bad here, but if something is red, blue and green I'd rather say that than it was red and blue and green.  Doing so once is for effect, more is for affectation.  And bloody vexing when if goes on page after page.  Using 4 to 6 adjectives to describe things in the same sentence also just bogs things down.  Also I think the author just tried a little too hard.  The descriptions are arduous, effortful, and for me did not evoke the intended horror, otherness whatever.  I found the characters lacked life and were frankly not distinctive enough for me to try to keep them straight, or care about their fates.  And the dialogue just didn't ring true, profanity for effect but just sort of falling flat like, well, profanity for effect.  When I compare that to Radiant Dawn where the characters jump off the page, develop and become people I cared about, and where the dialogue bristles, sparkles, keeping me reading at a break neck pace...Hive suffers by comparison.  I set it down a few times and read some other books in between attempts at finishing it.  On the other hand I did not punt on it like I did Nightmare's Disciple and A Darkness Inbred.<br /><br />So a mixed bag here.  The book in paperback is very reasonable priced, eligible for free shipping.  And it was a noble effort.  I did care about the plot and wanted to see where Curran ended the story, and I did think the ending was satisfying (if anticipated by \\"the Thing\\" again).  I'll give it 3 stars.  I await other opinions with interest.  I certainly will not shy away from Curran's future mythos offerings.hich is not a bad thing!).

Lovecraft Institute	Books	2	0	1	N	Y	Mythos trappings without being the genuine article	I read this book in a desultory fashion while on a cross country drive.  Here follow my impressions.The HP Lovecraft Institute is by David Bischoff who is apparently widely published, although I've never read anything by him.  He has written several other novels with similar titles like JRR Tolkein University.  This book is a publication from Wildside Press, an Alan Rogers book (so I guess he was the editor?), with a publication date of 2002.  List price is $34.95, no discounts noted.  I forget how long ago I got my copy, or how much I paid for it.  I can't figure out who did the cover art, a sort of picture of HPL in an octopus like body, rather drab.  Page count was 386.  Physically it is a handsome book but the editing was remarkably poor.  Typos abounded, with misspellings, word subsitutions and characters changing names in mid page.  This reflects the fact that the editor should have demanded a few more rewrites.<br /><br />I'll be brief and will not describe the plot in detail.  This may spoil it somewhat for those who care.  Basically this is a case where an evil sorcerer type has used an arcane power source to prolong his life.  By means of blood sacrifice, now that the stars are right, he intends to open a gate to allow Nyarlathotep access to our plane.  Sounds very Lovecraftian.  Didn't read that way.  This novel was fraught with problems.  In fact the genre seems much more suited to the short story, although recently I did enjoy Balak and the work of Cody Goodfellow.  HPL Institute read more like a Stephen King wannabe than an HPL knock off.  This sorcerer type has killed his brother years before, and enslaved his niece, making her a vampire (not very mythos).  Of course there is a disillusioned minister with a son who has nascent telepathy and telekinesis powers, an oversexed teen girl, and the brother has been resurrected somehow as a skeleton named Mr. Bones who communicates with an innocent young girl, making his home in her closet....I could go on. Stock King situations and characters, unscary gore verging on the schlocky, unsexy sex verging on softcore porn, paper thin charcters who do not relate to one another in a believable way (particularly when the son catches the dad in hanky panky with a high school girl he has some interest in), weak dialogue, a confused jumble of subgenres, less than compelling prose.  Well I liked a few of the brief vignettes but mostly this was forgettable.  No sense at all of the cosmicism of HPL which I really like.  I also need to mention that HPL made an appearance as someone the sorcerer type told all to, and who then wrote up this truth as fiction and who was then offed by the sorcerer.  I really dislike this plot device, where HPL is mentioned as having written fiction that was actually true.<br /><br />With everything else I guess the most unforgivable fault for me was that it was boring.  I kept looking wistfully at other books in my stack, but forced myself to finish based on the price paid.  If the prose had sparkle I still could have recommended this book.  As it was, at the price, I suggest borrowing it from the library instead of paying cash if you really want to read it.  You miss nothing if you give it a miss.  I certainly was relieved to be done with it.  On the other hand it was much better than stuff like Horror Between the Sheets.ng situations and characters, unscary gore verging on the schlocky, unsexy sex verging on softcore porn, paper thin charcters who do not relate to one another in a believable way (particularly when the son catches the dad in hanky panky with a high school girl he has some interest in), weak dialogue, a confused jumble of subgenres, less than compelling prose.

US	52899907	R1SUYKVEKPSZV4	0971152004	954066029	The Gardens of Lucullus	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Rome comes to life in vivid S&S mythos saga	The Gardens of Lucullus, by Richard Tierney and Glenn Rahman, is a trade paperback published by Sidecar Preservation Society in 2001.  It lists for $15.95.  I was able to find a copy with diligent scouring of the internet; my copy was signed by the<br />authors.  It is a handsome production.  There is a nice painting of a Roman court on the front; unfortunately I couldn't figure out who did it.  The book was printed \\"xerographically.\\"  Page count was 275.  Although it is a good production I am not so sure about the long term durability of the materials.  My copy must have been sitting on Shockline's shelves since the original printing and I found a very faint beginning of yellowing around the edges; the same thing is happening to my copy of Dead But Dreaming.  The introduction is by the ubiquitous Robert Price.  Mostly it is OK, although as usual he managed to really irritate me, this time by writing that this novel is \\"much better than it needs to be.\\"  What, Bob?  Are the authors a pair of hacks, or will the fans lap up any old junk?  (...well, *I* will, but that doesn't mean we *all* will...)<br /><br />Moving on, this is a Simon of Gitta book.  I have a copy of Chaosium's The Scroll of Thoth by Tierney somewhere, although I only ever read a few of the stories in it.  There is a character who is a Hibernian gladiator, Rufus Hibernicus.  I think he is the creation of Glenn Rahman, and the two authors must have collaborated to bring their characters together in imperial Rome.<br /><br />The novel reads like a superior Sword and Sorcery work, with obvious antecedents in Robert E. Howard.  What is different is the setting, in ancient Rome during the rule of Claudius and Messalina.  The historical detail and accuracy are very rich and really add to the attractiveness of this novel.  (At least, I think the detail is accurate.  My vague understanding of ancient Rome comes from movies like The Robe, 5 years of high school Latin and watching I, Claudius...).  The city comes alive under the authors' pens.  The saga is fast paced with some nice action sequences and some magical duels.  Best of all is the scheming, plotting and intriguing, which are well thought out.  In the end, of course, for all the involving historical tapestry, this is a S&S novel, so there is a certain lack of depth and a bit of deus ex machina in the plotting, and particularly the ending.<br /><br />So how does this appeal to the Cthulhu mythos fan?  Well, it turns out that Messalina and some crafty Vestals are acutally priestesses of Magna Mater, and Magna Mater is actually an entity from beyond our space/dimension.  She has many names, one of which is Shupnikkurat.  Her idol is represented as a black male goat head with the torso of a termite queen.  She/it is using human servitors to open a way for her/it or her/its spawn to cross into our world.  At one point Simon is matching wits with her servitors and invokes Nodens.  So Nodens confronts Shub Niggurath; how much more mythos can it be?  This is where the deus ex machina comes in; the only story where an HPL protagonist was able to be rescued from an outre entity with an incantation was The Dunwich Horror.  However this sort of thing happens all the time in Conan-esque stories.  These eldritch things transcend gender, but Shub Niggurath is almost always represented as a female (I actually found Neil Gaiman's I, Cthulhu, to be the coolest concept of how Great Old Ones reproduce, speaking of gender) so using this as a manifestation of the Magna Mater was perfectly justified.  So the plot is basically Messalina and her cronies using magic to control Claudius, while trying to invoke the Magna Mater's entry into our world.  Fortuitously for the world, Simon and Rufus get drawn into the plot, and Simon has sufficient training in sorcery to recognize the dangers.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend to all fans of the REH tradition.  If you like Conan I can't imagine you won't like The Gardens of Lucullus.  It is an attractive book, well written, well plotted and thoroughly researched, attractively priced.  However, I must say it is a light, frothy confection.  Those of you who are fans of HPL instead and prefer a stronger brew can safely pass it by.  It did not have the same sense of otherness or horror, the realization by the protagonist (or reader) of the insignificance of humans, the brooding influence of malevolent or indifferent aliens that characterizes the mythos for me.  The use of entities with mythosian names, while not inappropirate,  struck me as incidental.  Tierney and Rahman could easily have substituted any other malevolent Roman, Greek, Egyptian, whatever spirit as the focal point, and would have lost nothing.<br /><br />Well worth the money if you can track it down.ive book, well written, well plotted and thoroughly researched, attractively priced.

Well I could not resist the allure of a collection of stories from Cthulhu Sex magazine. Mainly based on the title.  I mean, there had to be at least a few mythos stories in there, right?  And when I got Cthulhu and the Coeds, it had a bunch of dogs, but a fine gem \\"The Scrimshaw Museum\\" that made me happy, so the same had to hold true for Horror Between the Sheets, right?<br /><br />Wrooooongggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!<br /><br />I really should have listened to mythos fans who were more cautionary.  This book was $12.95, alas another kick in the teeth when considering the worth of the collection.  Page count was 163, a little less than, for example, Lost Worlds of Space and Time, but then the cost is a few dollars less.  Production qualities are about the same as other trade paperbacks, meaning I am concerned that it won't hold up well compared to paperbacks of yore.  I was wondering if there was some way to tell if it was POD although with this process some books are very finely wrought, like Eldritch Blue.  Lost Worlds of Space and Time, however, seems a cut lower.  Horror Between the Sheets may be a click lower still.  If I am right, and these are POD type books.  The cover art by Michael Amorel was OK, showing some tentacles reaching through some sea weedy depths, in crimson light.  OK, I liked it well enough, no wow factor like Cthulhu 2000 or Horrors Beyond.  The editors were Michael Amorel, Oliver Baer and Benjamin Wretlind, three persons I never heard of and won't be seeking out fiction by.<br /><br />Right from the get go I have to say that I was terribly disappointed.  Why the bleep do they call it Cthulhu Sex when it has nothing to do with Lovecraft except if you contort tangential associations enormously.  Also the writing was generally mediocre compared to that seen in recent mythos anthologies like Dreaming in R'lyeh, Eldritch Blue, Lost Worlds of Space and Time or Horrors Beyond.  The list seems to be a generous sampling of items, but just about every other work was<br /><br />a tedious poem, which were even less readable than the prose.  Here is the contents list.  A lot of the stories were made worse by the arch, too hip for words, you have to be in on the joke kind of (feeble attempt at) humor that pervaded the anthology from the introduction onward.  Body orifices and gore do not horror make, and certainly don't make it mythos.<br /><br />Introduction by Michael Amorel<br /><br />The Noseeums by Jeremy Russell<br /><br />The Titterer in the Twilight by Mark McLaughlin<br /><br />Erato's Sister by David Annandale<br /><br />Siren by David Galef<br /><br />Go Team by Kenneth Brady<br /><br />Cthulhu Sex (ahem!) -a poem- by Katherine Morel<br /><br />Beyond by Brian Knight & Durant Haire<br /><br />Elegy in a Graveyard by Lynne den Hartog<br /><br />A Slice of Life by Arthur Cullipher<br /><br />de sade begs to differ by MorrisoN<br /><br />Romancing the Worm by Sue D'Nimm<br /><br />Thaw by David Ethan Levit<br /><br />Skin by Joi A.

The poems are best left to your imagination.<br /><br />Noseeums is actually pretty good conventional story, maybe the best in the book, about a man in an asylum who sees entities that eat the souls of humans when they die, and so is hiding out.  His wife doesn't believe him, but he gives her a taste of what he sees.  This would not have been out of place in Horrors Beyond.<br /><br />Erato's Sister was by David Annandale.  This is distressing because Mr. Annandale wrote what may be the finest mythos tale of the modern era, Final Draft in Dead But Dreaming.  I find that story has astonishing prose and power.  And now he comes up with this awful gory ghouly sex bilge fest.<br /><br />Go Team had some (not mythos related) tentacles. Story wasn't very good, about demons taking over the far west and a cheerleader who saves the day, sort of.<br /><br />Beyond was actually OK, a private eye and a grizzled cop investigate a cult that is occult, having a malevolent thing leader from another world/dimension.  Some hard-boiled stuff.  Not great, but in comparison actually was readable.<br /><br />Slice of Life was a twisted retelling of Hansel and Gretel.  The thing had tentacles on its face.  Non-mythos tentacles.<br /><br />Romancing the Worm could not decide if it was weird western fiction or humor.  I think one or the other would have been better.  The very modern idiom didn't help with the confusion.  An Indian on the verge of manhood has to have relations with the tribe medicine woman and discovers a dark secret of the tribe.  I both liked and disliked this story.  Maybe if all the \\"poems\\" hadn't put me in a bad mood I would be more favorably inclined toward it.<br /><br />Skin was terrible, teen slasher piercing rebellion, boring and tedious.<br /><br />The Reaching Wall is where a popular teen goes off her rocker and imagines the bathroom wallpaper vines are trying to get her.<br /><br />Conventional horror.  OK but forgettable.<br /><br />The Masterpiece was short (thank goodness); a sculptor creates a statue that eats her boyfriend's essence.  There have been similar mythos stories.  This effort was pedestrian and predictable but readable.<br /><br />The Phone Company showed some predictable plotting as some geek types discover something unpleasant about the real workings of the phone company.  If this had been written as a straight up horror story it could have worked.  The humor part fell flat.<br /><br />He was hardly readable, nothing like the HPL story.<br /><br />Two Loves was schizophrenic, with some conventional suspense in the first part and a virtually unreadable morass in the second part.<br /><br />The Pear was a S&M story.  Interesting slant about the<br /><br />beauracratization of torture.  Really quite predictable, however.<br /><br />So in summary, nothing to interest the HPL reader who is looking for mythos related or inspired fiction.

I think The Barrens and HPL were both in Cthulhu 2000, and Meryphillia was in McNaughton's The Throne of Bones, being a story that is one of a series<br /><br />llinked together to form the title novella.  It is rather pricey<br /><br />particularly if you already own Cthulu 2000, hence the 3 star rating.<br /><br />The premise was that these stories were written, not necessarily to make a mythos collection, but for each author to show some way that Lovecraft influenced or affected him.  Robert Bloch's opening introduction is an affectionate description of Lovecraft's place in American horror.  At the end of each story an author's note describes how they were affected by Lovecraft.  As a consequence of this premise the stories are a kind of mixed bag of subgenres, some mythosian if not overtly invoking Cthulhu et al, some touching on themes central to Lovecraft of looking beyond the veil of reality (like the anthology Horrors Beyond), some not particularly having anything to do with Lovecraft.<br /><br />By and large I enjoyed them all.<br /><br />Minor spoilers may follow.<br /><br />A Secret of the Heart by Mort Castle - A man achieves immortality by bargaining with outre powers.  He relates the biography of his younger days and how he managed to live so long.  The theme of contacting other entities to achieve power or somesuch is very HPLish, but of course not original to or confined to HPL's worlds.  Decent enough read.<br /><br />The Other Man by Ray Garton - A man suspects his wife is leaving her body at night for the astral plane to meet another man's soul.  He follows and discovers a terrible being living in this astral world that devours souls.  The love triangle stuff is not really something seen in HPL, but the creature lying in wait in the extrasensory plane, while not a named entity, is very like a mythos being.  Again a decent read.<br /><br />Will by Graham Masterton - ....OK if you read this it will spoil the story!!!<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />Did you ever wonder where Will Shakespeare get his powers of<br /><br />inspiration?  Well he also used a contact with the Great Old Ones, Yog Sothoth to make a Faustian bargain.  The residual of his contact with Yog Sothoth maystill be found crawling in the muck in the ruins of the old Globe Theater, waiting to ensnare pesky archeologists.  Yet another decent read.  Haven't been blown away by any of these stories yet!<br /><br />Big \\"C\\" by Brian Lumley - The Big C refers to cancer, that develops in an astronaut and sort of takes on a life of its own after exposure to alien influences, grows huge and, um, malignant, and sets up housekeeping on earth.  Reminded me a lot of the working premise behind Cody Goodfellow's Radiant Dawn, although predating it by a decade.  Very Lovecraftian in sensibility altthough not involving conventional mythos entities.  This was a great and creepy story I had never seen before.<br /><br />Ugly by Gary Brandner - So so, about a man who's wife is cheating on him and is a hellion, so he devotes himself to a little lizard in a lump of plastic he finds as a curio at a swapmeet.  Results are predictable.  This I found to be pedestrian and not Lovecraftian at all.<br /><br />The Blade and the Claw by Hugh B. Cave - A nicely creepy voodoo novel of possession, although not very HPLish.  I thought it was an engaging read however.<br /><br />Soul Keeper by Joseph Citro - More like Misery, or even Psycho, than like anything by HPL.  A not so nice man is injured in a car wreck and is held prisoner by some nutcase.  Decent read but not much to do with HPL.<br /><br />The Papers of Helmut Hecker by Chet Williamson - This was a tribute story, sort of like HPL below.  So Lovecraft is still alive in the soul of a cat and another author acquires the cat and starts staying up at night, eating ice cream, using too many polysyllabic words etc.  OK concept, fair execution.  I generally dislike stories where HPL is a character<br /><br />Meryphillia by Brian McNaughton - Not Lovecraftian at all but VERY enjoyable.  I highly recommend everyone get a copy of McNaughton's Throne of Bones and read this story in its proper sequence with the rest of his ghoul stories.<br /><br />Lord of the Land by Gene Wolfe - Kind of HPLish as a man investigates the truth behind ancient legends in the old west.  Kind of like The Thing with an alien entity stuck here on earth for just needs somewhere to live (some host to live inside).  Well written as you might imagine.<br /><br />HPL by Gahan Wilson - Well known to mythos fans, HPL still lives in this tribute by the incomparable artist/cartoonist Gahan Wilson.  And he does!...in Wilson's imagination and memories as spelled out in the very nice author's note.  And I just contradicted myslef about disliking stories where HPL is a character!<br /><br />The Order of Things Unknown by Ed Gorman - only Lovecraftian in the sense that possession stories are one device HPL liked to use.  An ancient entity uses people to murder each other for sacrifices or somesuch.  Well written and enjoyable.<br /><br />The Barrens by F. Paul Wilson - To my mind, the best story in the book, very Lovecraftian in sensibility, vividly written.  In a remote forest in New Jersey an ex student from Miskatonic University strives to look beyond our perceptions of reality.<br /><br />So that about does it!  Expensive but decent page count, with stories that mostly had at least faint echoes of things Lovecraftian and were mostly decent reads.  Some real stunners, and the one klunker wasn't even that bad.  I guess if you already have Cthulhu 2000 and a Lumley collection with The Big \\"C\\", then you don't miss the most mythosish stories by passing this by.  In that case you also need to get The<br /><br />Throne of Bones by McNaughton.  But I also think anyone who gets this anthology will be able to idle away some pleasant hours reading.  Maybe not a ringing endorsement but I don't regret spending the money...I guess that's sort of a backhanded compliment too....your call!ater, waiting to ensnare pesky archeologists.

US	52899907	R2ZMXSFXSRR16B	1930846258	161946683	The Atrocity Archives	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Another winner from Stross	The Atrocity Archives by Charles Stross is a production from Golden Gryphon Press.  Cost is less than $18.00 with the usual shipping charges.  The book is in its second printing but 1st editions may still be found for those of you who care about such things.  It is a beautiful hardcover; all of Golden Gryphon's books have great production qualities.  I have a copy of<br />Eternal Lovecraft and it has similar appeaing features.  Binding is cloth with a nice slip cover with art by Steve Montiglio.  The painting depicts some arcane appearing machine creating a gate into another world, very well done and very appropriate to the subject of the book.<br /><br />There is an introduction by Kevin MacLeod and a detailed author's note at the end, both of which are enormously informative and as entertaining to read as the books iself.  The book in fact contains a novel, The Atrocity Archives, and a novella, The Concrete Jungle, which carries on with the same characters from The Atrocity Archives.  AA was originally serialized in a UK SF magazine, and was reprinted here; I am<br />not sure, but I think it may have been expanded some for the novel version.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know him, Charles Stross has written, in my opinion, one of the best mythos stories ever, A Colder War.  This story is available to read free online on his website and also in his story collection Toast.  I believe it will also appear in The Cthulhuian Singularity whenever that worthy collection sees the light of print. Now I am struggling to come up with comparisons here, the story is that good.  It sort of fits in with Cody Goodfellow's Radiant Dawn, or even more, the Delta Green fiction, where the Lovecraftian truth of the<br />universe is known by the governments of the nations and they try both desperately to conceal it from their citizens, and use this horrible knowledge as a weapon.  The soviets have a handful of shoggoths and the means to free Cthulhu, and the US has access to some extradimensional gates. I find the story wildly original, marvelously written, absolutely true to Lovecraft and also carrying a perfect sense of horror.  So it was with great anticipation that I turned to The Atrocity Archives.<br /><br />Some spoliers may follow.<br /><br />First, I really enjoyed reading this book and can recommed it without hesitation.  But I am having a very hard time deciding what the heck it is that I am recommending!  I read the novel and novella before the introduction or the author's note, and came to a conclusion that although this work lives and breathes in Lovecratft's worlds it is not really a mythos novel at all, not the way A Colder War is.  The author's note just confirmed my suspicions!  Most interesting is that Stross had not read Tim Power's Declare or any Delta Green before finishing AA, so it is entirely his own conception.<br /><br />Briefly, all the mythos entities etc are real, intelligent and malignant alien entities that exist in alternate universes (ah, the old multiverse concept!), who may have access to our universe if the proper ritual is performed.  It turns out that there is a scientific and mathematical basis for this ability to open gates , and it has been sytematized, and this knowledge is a closely held givernmental secret.  All the occultism has now become much more mundane.  I'll quote an example; \\"In the case of the great circuit of Al-Hazred, the terminator was originally a black goat, sacrificed at midnight with a silver knife<br />touched only by virgins, but these days we just use a fifty microfarad capacitor.\\"  Being a computer geek helps you create/understand/master the mathematical circuits you need.  Mundane, yes, but the danger to the summoner remains, particularly if you are trying to summon or manipulate a more intelligent alien entity.  In fact the AA refers to the record of The Holocaust, where the Nazis tried to use an enormous<br />blood sacrifice of millions to open the gates to supernatural aid that would have won the war for them (similar in concept but greater in scale than DG's Karotechia).  But nowadays everything is run by a labyrinthine, unnavigable and intractable civil service beauracracy.  And so this novel really is more a cloak and dagger spy novel, where the trappings are not so much James Bond gadgets as ancient geases, sarificial gates and hands of glory as standard issue occult weapons. Honestly, there is no Lovecraftian feel at all!  Anyone who seems to be stumbling onto the science or ritual necessary to manipulate reality this way is the forcibly recruited by the government for national<br />security reasons.<br /><br />The hero is Bob Howard, a hacker/computer geek turned field agent, who goes spook hunting to track down what seems to be the remnants of a cell devoted to the nazi dream of opening a gate so the ice giants, some malignant entity can come through and finish the war properly for once and all.  Someone a bit like Q issues him some occult gear, he never goes anywhere without a laptop or palmpilot, he rooms with some computer geeks who are busy creating nameless gates in the basement apparently for the heck of it, he basically has a small cubicle to call his own and supervisors who are quite petty.  All in all superbly written and great fun.  He meets a British expatriate named Dominique<br />who is of course strikingly pretty, a brilliant mathematician, a<br />computer geek and who falls for him.  Of all the characters she was the least successful, partly because in spite of all these qualities attributed to her she never rose above the level of window dressing, the damsel in distress who needed to be rescued.  High tech, low tech, extradimensional tech, this book was a corking good read.  But read it with mindset that it is a spy novel and you catch the flavor better.  I liked the novella The Concrete Jungle equally well.  I certainly hope Mr. Stross continues Bob Howard's adventures in future books!concept but greater in scale than DG's Karotechia).

US	52899907	R1OTHRA6URD5OZ	1887797092	777318466	Delta Green: Alien Intelligence	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Superb Delta Green book	Note: mild spoilers are included.<br /><br />Not to keep anyone in suspense (not that anyone was in suspense), I really liked this story collection.  It may be hard to come by so if you really want this title (and you should!) just be diligent.<br /><br />One overall impression: this was a relatively new genre, outside of RPG for the DG crew.  I found The Rules of Engagement and the first few stories of Dark Theaters to be superior.  I have not read the original source book but it did not lessen my enjoyment of the stories.<br /><br />John Tynes - The Dark Above:  There were certain things<br /><br />about this story I thought were too over the top, particularly the lead man going ballistic when he smelled a fish-like odor from a woman.  Also I don't know if Forrest was a character from the source book, because you just had to accept his hardened attitude toward the deep ones half breeds.  What I mean was this emotional aspect of character development wasn't as well realized as the rest of the story.  Too bad, because the actual substance of the story and its imagery were terrific.<br /><br />Dennis Detwiller - Drowning in Sand&#8221: A great read!<br /><br />Ray Winniger - Pnomus: Another great read!!  Both of these stories epitomize the best of modern, creative mythos fiction.<br /><br />Bruce Baugh - Climbing the South Mountain: An OK conventional brain robbing mythos type story in poem form.  I'm not<br /><br />too into mythos poetry.  The very end of the narrators's poem and the memo from Delta Green were the best parts for me.<br /><br />Greg Stolze - Potential Recruit: Yet another great read, this time about trying to infiltrate cult with darker connections than suspected.<br /><br />Adam Scott Glancy - An Item of Mutual Interest: Perhaps<br /><br />the most coventional type mythos story in the book.  Enjoyable but nothing special.<br /><br />Bob Kruger - Identity Crisis: Did not knock my socks off.  Maybe it tried to cover a little too much ground and would have<br /><br />worked better as a short novel.  Still a very agreeable read.<br /><br />Blair Reynolds - Operation Looking Glass: A fast paced roller coaster ride to ice the cake of this nifty anthology.<br /><br />My complaints are perhaps too cantankerous.  This collections beats out any of the Chaosium collections (except maybe The Hastur Cycle) for consistent overall quality.  Those anthologies have too much chaff with the wheat.  It tops most of the Fedogan and Bremer collections too (except Cthulhu 2000, the first place I saw Black Man With A Horn).<br /><br />Essential reading for the modern Cthulhu mythos reader.ground and would have  <br />worked better as a short novel.

US	52899907	RIIGWPD9KU4EG	0974029750	100883485	Eldritch Blue: Love & Sex in the Cthulhu Mythos	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Exellent new addition to the mythos library	Eldritch Blue is a publication of Lindisfarne press.  It is a POD book.  My overall impression is quite favorable.  The production qualities are very high.  It is a good quality trade paperback, that should be very durable and provide many years of rereading pleasure.  It is somewhat pricier than a comparable Chaosium anthology, currenty at $21.00, but then it has more good stories than the typical Chaosium offering.<br /><br />In some respects, it is a better concept than the Chaosium series, as there is no attempt made to offer a comprehensive picture of the development of a particular aspect of the Cthulhu mythos.  This leads to the inclusion of really poorly written stories in the Chaosium anthologies, just because they may be hypothetically important in getting a picture of the larger concept.  (The dreadful goat leg stories in the Shub Niggurath Cycle spring to mind).  Eldritch Blue is more concerned with gathering together a selection of stories exploring the issues of love and sex in Lovecraftian fiction.  I can't recall the page number in Eldritch Blue but for the money it was a generous sampling of stories.  The other thing to note, is the overall quality of the stories was better than a typical Chaosium anthology, if not as high as Dead But Dreaming or Cthulhu 2000.<br /><br />The artwork was by Susan McAdam.  The cover was a very striking work, and I think very mch emphasized the theme of sex and horror quite well.  The interior artwork was enjoyable, although not all as successful.  I particularly liked the illustrations for Mail Order Bride, Seduced and The Obsession of Percival Carstairs.  Overall the art matched the mood of the story and enhanced the experience, adding to the enjoyability of the book.<br /><br />For the most part the editing was good, with only a few annoying typos.  One was partcularly glaring to the rheumatologist in me, in Stacked Actors, but I don't know if it was the editor or the author responsible for misspelling Raynaud's disease.  And mislabeling it, when what was meant was Raynaud's phenomenon.  Oh, well, no one else would notice.<br /><br />Do I have several gripes?  You bet!  First of all, Bob Price always finds a way to drive me crazy!  The silly title of his introduction did not sit well with me.<br /><br />I also found the editor's notes after each story to be near excruciating.  They show what I think is a basic wrong-headed view of what Lovecraftian fiction is all about.  I'll give an example later, as best as my memory allows.  On the other hand, they appear after each work so they are not spoilers, and you can easily skip them.  The biographical notes at the end were good.<br /><br />And as usual, some of these stories are in other anthologies in my collection and some I have read online, leading to duplication.  This will always be an issue for the dedicated HPL mythos fan.<br /><br />Moving on to individual stories (****spoilers may follow****):<br /><br />Promethes:  Where Walks Istasha, by James Ambuehl - well, I'm not a big fan of mythos poetry....<br /><br />The Tale of Toad Loop, by Stanley C. Sargent - An OK mythos fiction work.  Nothing special but not out of place and worth the read, if not a reread.<br /><br />Goat-Mother, by Pierre Comtois - I found this story to be one of the jewels of the anthology.  It was well written, tightly plotted, refreshingly different and had excellent horror elements.  I look forward to more stories by Mr. Comtois!  Now this is where I had some heartburn with the editor's notes.  First of all, I would rate this story as one of the 3 best centering around the Tcho Tcho people I have ever read.  The other 2 were Black Man With A Horn by TED Klein, and a novella by Arinn Dembo in the Delta Green: Dark Theaters anthology.  All 3 are marveous stories.  All 3 works have completely different takes on the Tcho Tcho.  And that's OK!  Nothing about Yog-Sothothery has to be internally consistent.  I guess I use the term Mythos out of conveniencebecause it is shorter to type, but it is not really a unified mythos cycle, where there are rigid rules of interpretation.  Vagueness, lack of precision, whatever you call it, allows enormous room for creative authors to develop new ideas on familiar themes for us fans.  And for pity's sake, Lovecraftian fiction has no need whatever to correspond with the scientific strictures of our natural world.  Who cares about the details of reproduction of these noxious creatures that Pierre Comtois created, and where they fit in with earth biology phylogenetically?  The scenes were delightfully creepy and allowed the reader's imagination to run wild.  My only word of caution to Mr. Comtois is that there was no need for an italicized ending.  The horror was self evident and did not need the emphasis.  Bravo!<br /><br />Beast of Love, by Tracy and James Ambuehl - Now if anyone knows how to dispose of a mythos protagonist it is James Ambuehl!  This was a typically fun Ambuehl read, and I look forward to his upcoming new stories in the Lindisfarne series.<br /><br />The Spawn of Y'lagh, by Randall Larson - This didn't do much for me.  It was a very conventional mythos tale, not particularly well written.  On the other hand it wasn't dreadfully bad, and it did not detract from the anthology.<br /><br />Mail Order Bride, by Ann K. Schwader - This is a brilliant story, about intermarriage with the Deep Ones from an entirely original angle.  The prose and characterizations were acute.  Any gripe?  Well this story is already in Strange Stars and Alien Shadows, so it commits the sin of duplication, but in a tale this fine, we'll consider it venial instead of mortal.  I wish Ms. Schwader would hurry up and write some more new mythos stories<br /><br />Family Recipe, by Charles Garofalo - A tightly written story, again about the Deep Ones intermingling with humans, with another original twist.  It was a very fun read, although I like other stories here better.  I would like to read more by Mr. Garofalo.<br /><br />Cat's-Paw, by E. P. Berglund - An excellent Shub Niggurath story, with well-drawn characters and enjoyable prose.  It held up the high standards of the anthology.<br /><br />The Faces at Pine Dunes, by Ramsey Campbell - Ramsay Campbell - what can I say- it was a wonderful story.  I just wish Mr. Campbell would write some new mythos stuff.  Also, it is reprinted from other anthologies.<br /><br />Dagon's Mistress, by Neil Riebe - This story was only fair, with a conventional mythos plot that had an unusually upbeat turn.  Mainly the prose didn't grab me, and the ending didn't ring true for a mythos collection.<br /><br />The Thing on the Doorstep, by H. P. Lovecraft - Of course, one of HPL's best, so marvelous.  However, I counted and I have 6.23 zillion other copies in collections I already own.  Reduplicate duplication doubled.<br /><br />The Prodigies of Monkfield Cabot, by Michael Minnis - An interesting take on The Thing on the Doorstep, being a prequel rather than a sequel.  It was good, although the plot twists and prose did not sparkle as much as the best stories in here.  Nonetheless, not out of place, and better than many stories in Chaosium anthologies.  I will certainly get all the collections Lindisfarne publishes of Mr. Minnis' work.<br /><br />Seduced, by Ronald Shiflet - Brilliant.  Just brilliant.  Plot, prose, characterization, all superb.  One of the very best Shub Niggurath stories I have ever read.  Bravo, Mr. Shiflet.  I will run, not walk, to buy his collections on this label.<br /><br />Stacked Actors, by Peter A. Worthy - Now this story gave me a bit of heartburn.  I am a fan of Stross and of Delta Green, so I like the subgenre, but this just didn't do it for me.  Per the author summaries I know Mr. Worthy is living in Scotland, but I don't know where he is originally from.  However, there was no reason to believe this as a story occurring in England.  None of the idiom rang true for me; it all seemed very American.  Furthermore, the story was way too in medias res.  It seemed over half the story was filling us in on background, instead of giving us exposition of the current plot.  It also had a very lifted-from-an RPG-scenario feel in a way the best Delta Green does not.  Maybe there was too much risk of DG overlap if set in the US?  At any rate, if we visit these characters again I hope the emphasis is on the current story, with more attention to plotting and characterization than to setting the stage.<br /><br />Have You Found Him, by Jean Ann Donnel - A well-written fragment, but too short to really grab me.<br /><br />The Violet Princess, by Stephen Mark Rainey - A wonderful story by Mr. Rainey, as we all expect.  The prose just captured the isolation and frustrated longing of the protagonist beautifully.  And I loved the ending.<br /><br />What Sort of Man, by Walter C. DeBill, Jr. - Another excellent story in an excellent collection, about a man whose family trades with aliens from Carcosa to acquire unusual antiques for their business.  Anything I write might give away the plot, so I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />The Obsession of Percival Cairstairs, by Charles Black - OK conventional mythos story, predictable but not unenjoyable.  Commits the sin of the italicized ending trying to add punch where better prose would have helped more. Not a bad story, certainly would have found a place in a Chaosium anthology.<br /><br />A Mate For the Mutilator, by Robert M. Price - Price's fiction doesn't really grab me.  I liked the plot idea, but the characters were not well developed, and the prose didn't match the best in the anthology. OK, not bad, just not the best I have ever read.<br /><br />To Cast Out Fear, C. J. Henderson - An OK Anton Zardak story - not my favorite subgenre, but written about the level of Lin Carter, so a plus for fans.<br /><br />The Surrogate, by Kevin L. O'Brien - Well, I wished I liked it better.  Mr. O'Brien knows how to compile an anthology but his writing does not move me.  First of all the prose wasn't that great.  For example, would any prostitute, even in the Mile High City, ever refer to herself as a doxy?  The characters were bland and undeveloped, so it was hard to care what happened to them.  I also could not for the life of me figure out why the mother or the prostitute liked her son at all.  There was no patina of horror to shade the whole story as is usually required for good mythos fiction, and there was nothing stated or implied that would show if the creature was controlling their minds to make them do its bidding.  The prostitute at least should have been utterly numb with fear.  And, frankly, Jim Ambuehl would have had her get eaten in a respectable mythos story ending creepfest.<br /><br />So, I had a highly favorable impression of Eldritch Blue.  A handsome production packed with new stories, for the most part extremely well written, with the best soaring to the highest heights of mythos fiction.  Any fan would be well advised to spend their hard earned Cthulhu bucks on it.-drawn characters and enjoyable prose.  It held up the high standards of the anthology.     The Faces at Pine Dunes, by Ramsey Campbell - Ramsay Campbell - what can I say- it was a wonderful story.  I just wish Mr. Campbell would write some new mythos stuff.  Also, it is reprinted from other anthologies.    Dagon's Mistress, by Neil Riebe - This story was only fair, with a conventional mythos plot that had an unusually upbeat turn.  Mainly the prose didn't grab me, and the ending didn't ring true for a mythos collection.     The Thing on the Doorstep, by H. P. Lovecraft - Of course, one of HPL's best, so marvelous.  However, I counted and I have 6.23 zillion other copies in collections I already own.  Reduplicate duplication doubled.     The Prodigies of Monkfield Cabot, by Michael Minnis - An interesting take on The Thing on the Doorstep, being a prequel rather than a sequel.  It was good, although the plot twists and prose did not sparkle as much as the best stories in here.  Nonetheless, not out of place, and better than many stories in Chaosium anthologies.  I will certainly get all the collections Lindisfarne publishes of Mr. Minnis' work.     Seduced, by Ronald Shiflet - Brilliant.  Just brilliant.  Plot, prose, characterization, all superb.  One of the very best Shub Niggurath stories I have ever read.  Bravo, Mr. Shiflet.  I will run, not walk, to buy his collections on this label.     Stacked Actors, by Peter A. Worthy - Now this story gave me a bit of heartburn.  I am a fan of Stross and of Delta Green, so I like the subgenre, but this just didn't do it for me.  Per the author summaries I know Mr. Worthy is living in Scotland, but I don't know where he is originally from.  However, there was no reason to believe this as a story occurring in England.  None of the idiom rang true for me; it all seemed very American.  Furthermore, the story was way too in medias res.  It seemed over half the story was filling us in on background, instead of giving us exposition of the current plot.  It also had a very lifted-from-an RPG-scenario feel in a way the best Delta Green does not.  Maybe there was too much risk of DG overlap if set in the US?  At any rate, if we visit these characters again I hope the emphasis is on the current story, with more attention to plotting and characterization than to setting the stage.     Have You Found Him, by Jean Ann Donnel - A well-written fragment, but too short to really grab me.     The Violet Princess, by Stephen Mark Rainey - A wonderful story by Mr. Rainey, as we all expect.  The prose just captured the isolation and frustrated longing of the protagonist beautifully.  And I loved the ending.     What Sort of Man, by Walter C. DeBill, Jr. - Another excellent story in an excellent collection, about a man whose family trades with aliens from Carcosa to acquire unusual antiques for their business.  Anything I write might give away the plot, so I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed it.     The Obsession of Percival Cairstairs, by Charles Black - OK conventional mythos story, predictable but not unenjoyable.  Commits the sin of the italicized ending trying to add punch where better prose would have helped more. Not a bad story, certainly would have found a place in a Chaosium anthology.     A Mate For the Mutilator, by Robert M. Price - Price's fiction doesn't really grab me.  I liked the plot idea, but the characters were not well developed, and the prose didn't match the best in the anthology. OK, not bad, just not the best I have ever read.     To Cast Out Fear, C. J. Henderson - An OK Anton Zardak story - not my favorite subgenre, but written about the level of Lin Carter, so a plus for fans.     The Surrogate, by Kevin L. O'Brien - Well, I wished I liked it better.  Mr. O'Brien knows how to compile an anthology but his writing does not move me.  First of all the prose wasn't that great.  For example, would any prostitute, even in the Mile High City, ever refer to herself as a doxy?  The characters were bland and undeveloped, so it was hard to care what happened to them.  I also could not for the life of me figure out why the mother or the prostitute liked her son at all.  There was no patina of horror to shade the whole story as is usually required for good mythos fiction, and there was nothing stated or implied that would show if the creature was controlling their minds to make them do its bidding.  The prostitute at least should have been utterly numb with fear.  And, frankly, Jim Ambuehl would have had her get eaten in a respectable mythos story ending creepfest.     So, I had a highly favorable impression of Eldritch Blue.  A handsome production packed with new stories, for the most part extremely well written, with the best soaring to the highest heights of mythos fiction.  Any fan would be well advised to spend their hard earned Cthulhu bucks on it.	2005-06-06
US	52899907	RKDQJI0CZGXEU	0975922920	964521215	Horrors Beyond: Tales of Terrifying Realities	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Excellent outre horror	Horrors Beyond was published just this year by Elder Signs Press.  I got the hard cover and it has very high production qualities.  It is cloth bound, with a handsome slip cover.  There is a gorgeous cover painting by Dave Carson, filled with creepy visions of skull like things, images suggestive of the movie Alien and a Cthulhoid tentacled creature.  Page count is 281.  The slipcover has excerpts from a few stories.  There are minibios of the authors at the end of the book.  Otherwise there is no introduction or editor's notes.  The collection was edited by William Jones, who edits the Book of Dark Wisdom.  I subscribe but I am not otherwise familiar with his work.  So far I have to say that Elder Signs is a class act.  I like the production qualities of my trade paperback Ancient Exhumations +2, and the craftsmanship used in the magazine The of Book of Dark Wisdom.  Based on these I preordered The Hive and I am eager to get it.  The also have an upcoming anthology by Lupoff with at least some mythos stories.<br /><br />Horrors Beyond contains 18 stories.  All of them are newly published in this anthology, except Experiencing the Other by Ann K. Schwader.  Here are the contents:<br /><br />\\"The Eyes of Howard Curlix\\" by Tim Curran<br />\\"His Wonders in the Deep\\" by William Mitchell<br />\\"The Breach\\" by Lee Clark Zumpe<br />\\"Experiencing the Other\\" by Ann K. Schwader<br />\\"The Candle Room\\" by James S. Dorr<br />\\"A Little Color in Your Cheeks\\" by Mike Minnis<br />\\"One Way Conversation\\" by Brian M. Sammons<br />\\"After the War\\" by Tony Campbell<br />\\"The Blind\\" by Gerard Houarner<br />\\"The Hades Project\\" by John Sunseri<br />\\"A Form of Hospice\\" by Richard Gavin<br />\\"The Prototype\\" by Ron Shiflet<br />\\"False Containment\\" by David Conyers<br />\\"Dingbats\\" by Richard A. Lupoff<br />\\"The Orion Man\\" by Doug Goodman<br />\\"Vuuduu\\" by C.J. Henderson<br />\\"Cahokia\\" by Cody Goodfellow<br />\\"The Name of the Enemy\\" by William Jones<br /><br />A very impressive author list!  The inclusion of works by such fine writers is another measure of the care taken with publishing this book.  The premise of the collection is to write about what may be occurring just beyond sight of our experience, between or beyond the edges of reality, hidden in shadows or sneaking through the cracks between dimensions.  Although not specifically a mythos collection this theme is central to Lovecraft's world (yes, I know that HPL is not the only writer who wrote along these lines, but I'm a fan of mythos fiction), and many of the stories directly use mythos ideas or are inspired by or informed by Lovecraft.  As a consequence this collection is of direct interest to fans of mythos fiction.<br /><br />The short version of my opinion is that this is a terrific book and all mythos fans should read it!<br /><br />Minor to major spoilers about the individual stories may follow.<br /><br />\\"The Eyes of Howard Curlix\\" by Tim Curran  - I have read one other story by Tim Curran, \\"The Chattering of Tiny Teeth\\" in Warfear, a delightfully creepy exploration of ghouls residing in No Man's Land during WWI.  This new story concerns a tabloid journalist who interviews a scientist who has found a way to perceive the worlds that we cannot perceive because our vision is limited to a small fraction of the electromagnetic  spectrum, and how our perception of what dwells there allows it to perceive us.  This was a very well written tale, a great way to kick off the anthology.  No mythosian entities but an overt nod to Abdul Alhazred.<br /><br />\\"His Wonders in the Deep\\" by William Mitchell  - This is the first story by William Mitchell that I have read.  In this story a bereaved doctor attempts to resurrect his wife and family lost at sea.  Not directly mythosian, but entities lurk around the fringes who attempt to use human fear to make a passage into our universe.  Well written, enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"The Breach\\" by Lee Clark Zumpe  - I am not familiar with any other work by Mr. Zumpe.  Inthis tale, a scientist attempts, alas successfully, to establish contact with universes that exist parallel to our own.  The results are less than happy for all concerned.  Based on this story I would like the 0pportunity to read more of Mr. Zumpe's work.<br /><br />\\"Experiencing the Other\\" by Ann K. Schwader - This is the only story to be previously published.  I first read it in Strange Stars and Alien Shadows.  It is a sequel to another story of hers, \\"Twenty Mile.\\"  For me this was the biggest misfire of the anthology.  The story is good enough, but it is so clearly a sequel to \\"Twenty Mile\\" that I don't think it stands alone all that well.  Furthermore, \\"Twenty Mile\\" was uncommonly fine, and \\"Experiencing the Other\\" suffers a bit by comparison.  Maybe someone who never read her other stories would have a different opinion, I dunno.<br /><br />\\"The Candle Room\\" by James S. Dorr - Another author new to me, although I may seek out his collections in the future.  This story was also about contacting other life forms that want to come through to our world.  While enjoyable I did not like it as much as some of the others contained in the anthology.  I'm not sure why; the writing just did not grab me that much.<br /><br />\\"A Little Color in Your Cheeks\\" by Mike Minnis  - Mr. Minnis is known to mythos fans for \\"The Prodigies of Monkfield Cabot\\" from Eldritch Blue (an OK prequel to \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\"), \\"Salt Air\\" (a superb Yellow Sign story in the superb anthology Dead But Dreaming) and more recently \\"The Butcher of Vyones\\" (one of the very beststories in the excellent CAS tribute anthology, Lost Worlds of Space and Time).  Mike Minnis has been a very busy boy lately and we are all the richer for it.  The story in Horrors Beyond is a sequel to \\"The Colour Out of Space.\\"  The first few pages were taken up by what was basically a synopsis of the Lovecraft story, already well known to all us fanatics.  So this part dragged for me.  The remainder was a wonderfully creepy depiction of a backwoods type who lives (for now) on the shore of the new Arkham reservoir.  The inevitable comparison is \\"The Colour Out of Time\\" by Michael Shea (which ran on a bit too long for my taste), although we (semi) eagerly await \\"The Colour Out of Darkness\\" by John Pelan.<br /><br />\\"One Way Conversation\\" by Brian M. Sammons - Utterly superb!  This story alone was worth the price of the anthology.  Surely it is one of the finest Hounds of Tindalos stories ever.  I would love to get better acquainted with Mr. Sammons' fiction.<br /><br />\\"After the War\\" by Tony Campbell - Another author new to me.  I would rate this story as OK, nothing special but enjoyable, from the straight up scifi 'humans vs muties' genre.<br /><br />\\"The Blind\\" by Gerard Houarner - I don't recall reading any of Mr. Houarner's stuff before, but he is widely published so maybe I have.  This was not a mythos story per se but it was certainly written with the central theme of the anthology in mind, and as such has at least echoes of Lovecraft.  A junkie wants to escape her current reality or gain some insight into what is really real, and finds some aliens who will do this if they can rummage around in her experiences.  I thought this was a very effective piece of writing.<br /><br />\\"The Hades Project\\" by John Sunseri - A new author to me.  This story was another very effective piece of writing, about an outr&eacute; entity who has altered the memory of everyone on earth as it prepares to hunker down here for a feast, except that of our protagonist.  Not overtly mythos but a good nod in that direction.<br /><br />\\"A Form of Hospice\\" by Richard Gavin - Mr. Gavin has a collection out from Rainfall but I have never read his work before.  Based on this story I think I will look up Charnel Wine from Rainfall Books.  A man with cancer tried to heal himself with dreams under the guidance of a new age type.  Alas, the healing is a sort of Faustian bargain with outr&eacute; entities who want to take up residence.  As with many stories this is not directly mythos in that it does not deal with named entities, but it certainly is a comfortable read for HPL fans.  It was a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />\\"The Prototype\\" by Ron Shiflet - Mr. Shiflet is well to fans of HPL derived fiction.  I thought his story \\"Seduced' in Eldritch Blue was brilliant.  He has a story in a recent issue of The Book of Dark Wisdom that I haven't gotten around to reading yet.  And I guess we all have to wait to find out what happens to Lindisfarne Press to see if we see more of his stories in print.  \\"The Prototype\\" is a more straight up scifi look at some alien types distributing TVs that are actually means of egress into our world.  I could easily visualize this as an episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  One of my favorite aspects of Ron's writing is the way the characters jump off the page.  Non mythos but enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"False Containment\\" by David Conyers - Mr. Conyers wrote a story that appeared in issue II of Dreaming in R'lyeh.  That story was \\"A Shared Romance\\" which was an absolutely wonderful Australian Yig story, the gem of the issue and worthy of wider dissemination.  Well David Conyers does it again.  \\"False Containment\\" is marvelous, maybe the best story in the book.  His take on the various properties of shoggoths results in a similar result to Cody Goodfellow in Ravenous Dusk or \\"Big C\\" by Lumley in Lovecraft's Legacy.  It is kind of cool to see how different authors thinking through a Lovecraftian creation can come up independently with a similar result.  I also like how Conyers thinks through what I call the Yog Sothoth problem, where this entity is contemporary with all time and is not limited by 3 spatial dimensions.  How would you interact with a creature like that?  This was addressed to a degree by AA Attanasio in \\"Glimpses\\" but Conyers' take is more like \\"As I See It\\" by Greg Stolze in Delta Green: Dark Theaters.  All in all a very impressive effort!  I hope that Mr. Conyers is planning a great deal more mythos fiction.<br /><br />\\"Dingbats\\" by Richard A. Lupoff - Lupoff is widely published but heck if I can recall reading anything by him before.  An OK scifi space story with echoes of many Star Trek episodes where an entity can manipulate your mind to fulfill your fantasy worlds.<br /><br />\\"The Orion Man\\" by Doug Goodman - Doug Goodman was new to me.  \\"The Orion Man\\" was a nicely creepy story of a man who seems to be the only one who can see the truth of alien presences on earth, with certain constellation tattoos having special significance.  Not really mythos but I liked it.<br /><br />\\"Vuuduu\\" by C.J. Henderson - Of course CJ Henderson has impeccable mythos credentials, is widely published and is active on ahc.  I pretty much have enjoyed everything I have read by CJ Henderson and I keep promising myself I will read his collection of occult detective stories that is sitting on my bookshelf.  \\"Vuuduu\\" reminds me of a story I read maybe 30 years ago; I forget both title and author, but someone inadvertently stumbled on a sonic frequency that put the listener into<br />a perfect state of contentment, so they didn't want to move or do anything.  Of course this was then used to take over the world.  Similarly but more topical for the early 21st century, Vuuduu is a music program that allows you to pirate any song.  Of course pretty soon everyone (but our protagonist) is listening to Vuuduu created tapes.  The end however has a nice twist on this sort of story.  Tightly written as you might expect but not really mythos.<br /><br />\\"Cahokia\\" by Cody Goodfellow - If you don't recognize the name Cody Goodfellow it means you haven't read Radiant Dawn and that means you are cheating yourself out of one whale of a read, an absolute knock out.  The companion novel Ravenous Dusk was slightly more problematic but was also a page turner.  In \\"Cahokia\\" we find out what happened to all those civilizations, like the Cahokia mound builders, that vanished without a trace.  More pure scifi, with faintest echoes of Lovecraft, but an absorbing read.<br /><br />\\"The Name of the Enemy\\" by William Jones - William Jones edits The Book of Dark Wisdom and edited this book, so thank you Mr. Jones!  Keep the good work up!  My impression of this book was more pure scifi, not particularly horror nor mythos.  How do you fight an unbeatable enemy?  A nifty read to finish out a great anthology.<br /><br />So in summary, this is a terrific collection.  I only mention what I construed as non mythos to allow the reader to decide if this is what they are looking for.  None of these stories were bad, most were excellent and at least 2 reached the heights of the finest mythos stories available.  The trade paperback price is very reasonable and I can't imagine any HPL fan not loving this book.  No need to wait, order it now!ans.  It was a very enjoyable read.     \\"The Prototype\\" by Ron Shiflet - Mr. Shiflet is well to fans of HPL derived fiction.  I thought his story \\"Seduced' in Eldritch Blue was brilliant.

US	52899907	R1COX4CD4ICR5S	0965590178	221617508	Eternal Lovecraft: The Persistence of Hpl in Popular Culture	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Great production values from Golden Gryphon	While I was at a meeting in St. Louis I came across this collection by Golden Gryphon Press.  Publication date was 1998.  It was expensive but $17.93 is very reasonable for high quality hardcover.<br /><br />First, the production values are high quality with a nice hardcover binding.  The dustjacket has a wonderful painting by Nicholas Jainschigg, that depicts a glowing eye stranger walking away as some entity, perhaps Yog Sothoth, enters our dimension in the clouds.  It is perhaps a little flimsy, already getting a few small tears in the edges, but then I was carrying it everywhere.  The interior has some photographs of HPL.  I hadn't seen them before, but maybe they are famous ones.<br /><br />The editor was Jim Turner.  Yes, the Jim Turner.  No, I don't know who the heck he is either.  At any rate, his introduction is a nice scholarly essay mainly about The Shadow Out of Time.  At the end he describes the 3 sections he divided the stories into, ones in HPL settings or where HPL appears, ones where there is a more or less overt influence by Lovecraft, and ones that may imply a Lovecraftian cosmic view.  The last is similar to the more recent excellent anthology Horrors Beyond.  Yeah yeah (I thought as I was reading) let's get to the stories.  This was a compilation of previously published stories, and as such there is overlap with other anthologies (grumble).  By and large, Mr. Turner has selected very high quality stories and I am sorry to write that he stated that this would be his last Lovecraftian collection.<br /><br />On to the contents, is alphabetical order, not necessarily as they appear in the book:<br /><br />***There may be some spoilers below***<br /><br />Weird Tales by Fred Chappell: Actually a subsubgenre I find incredibly tedious is one where HPL makes an appearance.  It does less for me even than stories where the characters talk about HPL's works that supposedly depict fiction.  At any rate, this one did not do much for me.<br /><br />The Land of the Reflected Ones by Nancy A. Collins: I could swear I had read this before but I don't know where.  Not to worry, it is a finely crafted and creepy story about the dangers involved in casting spells from a musty tome when you don't really know what you are doing.  Very enjoyable and made me wish Ms. Collins has written more mythos stuff for me to discover.<br /><br />Sensible City by Harlan Ellison: Nice, creepy, ghoulish, but no definite Lovecraftian allusions that I can recall.  Nonetheless it reads well and does not sit out of place in such a collection.<br /><br />Ralph Wollstonecraft Hedge: A Memoir by Ron Goulart: Lame attempt at humor.  A low point.<br /><br />Crouch End by Stephen King:  Whatever anyone says, Mr. King deserves his accolades.  This is a terrific tale, moody, atmospheric, tensions mounting beautifully and plain scarey.  It concerns a couple who wander into a neighborhood in London that ends up being very far away from where they thought they were going.  A masterpiece.<br /><br />The Events at Poroth Farm by T. E. D. Klein:  This is only the second story by TED Klein that I have read.  You can argue whether it is truely mythos or not, with no overt appearance by any of our familiar entities/creatures, but you cannot argue that it is another finely wrought story.  Very creepy and tense.  A professor whiles away a summer in a small farmstead and encounters an unnatural and unwelcome visitor.<br /><br />A Bit of the Dark World by Fritz Leiber:  This did not have specific Lovecraftian connotations, but it did have an appropriately Lovecraftian feel, as the darkness becomes an entity, or conceals one, in an isolated California house in the mountains.  Like some others in the book, it did not feel out of place in a mythos collection, although it could have been included in a general science fiction or modern horror collection.  It was nice to read a story by Leiber, who was a true artist.<br /><br />The Shadow at the Bottom of the World by Thomas Ligotti: Creepy and effective, not overtly Lovecraftian by name, but certainly not out of place.  I guess on several of these stories you could say they felt like a mythos/Lovecraft indebted story while not making outright mention of mythos specific trappings.  I was glad to read it.<br /><br />The Turret by Richard A. Lupoff:  Hmph!  I already have Made in Goatswood!  I guess all editors should consult me to see if their contents will overlap my library!  Anyway, an excellent Severn Valley story.<br /><br />The Golden Keeper by Ian R. MacLeod:  This was quite a find.  A very good mythos novella set in the 3rd century AD, as a Roman official looks for golden treasure in a remote part of Egypt.  Does he find riches?  You decide...<br /><br />Her Misbegotten Son by Alan Rodgers:  Double hmph!!  I have the collection Miskatonic University, although I haven't read it yet. This story is well written and has some very creepy moments.  However the ending was atypically (for goings on at Arkham) happy, and one does not nromally expect Nyarlathotep to be banished by holy water.<br /><br />The Ocean and all Its Devices by William Browning Spencer:  A very mood moody story of the sea and some of its less pleasant inhabitants.<br /><br />Daoine Domhain by Peter Tremayne:  Triple hmph!!!  I think this story is in Shadows Over Innsmouth, but I don't have my copy handy.  Moving on, this story is a highly polished jewel, an absolutely wonderful story of the Deep Ones.  The writing is very moody, setting the atmosphere beautifully.  I loved it.  I hope Mr. Tremayne has written, or plans to write more mythos.<br /><br />Black as the Pit, from Pole to Pole by Steven Utley and Howard Waldrop: It is a well written story about Frankenstein's monster finding worlds inside the earth, following the events in Mary Shelley's classic novel.  The only reason it belongs in a Lovecraft collection is because of his encounter with The Great Race.  The story didn't interest me too much, although it was well done.<br /><br />The Giant Rat of Sumatra by Paula Volsky: Sherlock Holmes meets the mythos.  The story was a fair read, put in the shade by the many high quality stories included.  I haven't yet read Shadows Over Baker Street so I don't know if this story is in there.<br /><br />To Mars and Providence by Don Webb:  Like I said, I don't care for stories where HPL is a protagonist.<br /><br />The Perseids by Robert Charles Wilson: You can argue whether this belongs in a LOvecraftian collection.  It was well written and had some creepy overtones, but could easily have been left out.<br /><br />The Other Dead Man by Gene Wolfe: Science fiction horror that easily fits into a Lovecraft collection and easily can be excluded, like Leiber's story.  Wolfe is a great writer so it's a fun read, but there are no specific mythos references.<br /><br />So my final thought is that there are some magnificent mythos stories here, ones that I was previously unfamiliar with.  Based on this I hgihly recommend Eternal Lovecraft.  The overlap with other collections is minimal.  A fair number of stories had appropriate feel, even without specific overtones, and a number could have been left out.  There were only a few dogs, always a risk with a mythos collection.<br /><br />I am happy to have it in my library.ut of place.  I guess on several of these stories you could say they felt like a mythos/Lovecraft indebted story while not making outright mention of mythos specific trappings.  I was glad to read it.     The Turret by Richard A. Lupoff:  Hmph!  I already have Made in Goatswood!  I guess all editors should consult me to see if their contents will overlap my library!

However the ending was atypically (for goings on at Arkham) happy, and one does not nromally expect Nyarlathotep to be banished by holy water.     The Ocean and all Its Devices by William Browning Spencer:  A very mood moody story of the sea and some of its less pleasant inhabitants.     Daoine Domhain by Peter Tremayne:  Triple hmph!!!  I think this story is in Shadows Over Innsmouth, but I don't have my copy handy.  Moving on, this story is a highly polished jewel, an absolutely wonderful story of the Deep Ones.  The writing is very moody, setting the atmosphere beautifully.  I loved it.  I hope Mr. Tremayne has written, or plans to write more mythos.     Black as the Pit, from Pole to Pole by Steven Utley and Howard Waldrop: It is a well written story about Frankenstein's monster finding worlds inside the earth, following the events in Mary Shelley's classic novel.  The only reason it belongs in a Lovecraft collection is because of his encounter with The Great Race.  The story didn't interest me too much, although it was well done.     The Giant Rat of Sumatra by Paula Volsky: Sherlock Holmes meets the mythos.  The story was a fair read, putin the shade by the many high quality stories included.  I haven't yet read Shadows Over Baker Street so I don't know if this story is in there.     To Mars and Providence by Don Webb:  Like I said, I don't care for stories where HPL is a protagonist.     The Perseids by Robert Charles Wilson: You can argue whether this belongs in a LOvecraftian collection.  It was well written and had some creepy overtones, but could easily have been left out.     The Other Dead Man by Gene Wolfe: Science fiction horror that easily fits into a Lovecraft collection and easily can be excluded, like Leiber's story.  Wolfe is a great writer so it's a fun read, but there are no specific mythos references.     So my final thought is that there are some magnificent mythos stories here, ones that I was previously unfamiliar with.  Based on this I hgihly recommend Eternal Lovecraft.  The overlap with other collections is minimal.  A fair number of stories had appropriate feel, even without specific overtones, and a number could have been left out.  There were only a few dogs, always a risk with a mythos collection.     I am happy to have it in my library.	2005-06-06

I have the LSU Press edition from 2002.  It is a standard 5.5\\" x 8.5\\" trade paperback with 177 pages, seemingly substantial, but the font is larger than usual with trade paperbacks so it actually reads fairly quickly.  Production values are high; there is a cover illustration by Dave Ross showing a half man with a scaly lower body from behind, held captive in chains in some sort of ancient temple.  Evocative but no wow factor; there is no interior art (too bad, it might have relieved the tedium).  List price is $15.95.  This book was manufactured according to some standard on book longevity (again too bad, it will take that much longer to crumble away).<br /><br />Spoilers may follow, but who cares?<br /><br />I tend to buy and read almost anything mythos associated so of course I lapped it up.  Just after the title page there is a page devoted to Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.  Very auspicious!  Unfortunately that was also the highlight.<br /><br />I really did not like this book even a little bit and I have been trying to figure out why.  Sometimes mythos books fall apart because the prose is poor, like Other Nations, or the prose, plot and characterizations all stink, like Island Life, or because the book has really nothing to do with the mythos and instead has to do with schlocky gross out horror, like A Darkness Inbred.  This novel clearly was living and breathing in the world of the mythos, had a clearly thought out plot and had prose that was highly polished.  So what was the problem?<br /><br />First of all, I couldn't stand any of the characters, particularly the protagonist,  I was more concerned about Thomas Covenant than Peter Leland, and I wanted Thomas Covenant to meet an unseemly early end.  Second, it was dull, tedious, boring, a chore to read.  There was precious little forward momentum here.  Finally, although highly crafted, the prose was almost entirely devoted to Peter's tortuous and disinteresting introspection.  Also there was no awesomeness of a mythos entity or any sense of terror at all.  He was mostly pathetic and worth only the reader's disdain.<br /><br />In a typical (mercifully only 10-15 pages) mythos story, a protagonist goes to an ancient mansion/estate/farm and falls under the influence of some evil dabbler in mythos books, or their own dabbling in mythos books, who then loses control over their free will and gets used for or comes to unseemly ends.  The reader mainly sees it as either their journal entries or from a birds eye third person viewpoint.  This novel rather originally places you in the mind of the victim protagonist who doesn't have any understanding of what is going on, who knows nothing of the mythos.  He only catches glimpses but does not understand them or what the evil sorceror type is doing.  The mythos happenings are never made explicitly clear.  This *could* have been so cool.  So Peter gradually loses his will and his life to the vaguely fishoid appearing Mina, with his wife an innocent bystander victim along the way.  Nice premise, a slow disappointing slog to drag yourself through.<br /><br />Not recommended to anyone at all anywhere anytime.  Go reread Balak or something good instead.ly devoted to Peter's tortuous and disinteresting introspection.  Also there was no awesomeness of a mythos entity or any sense of terror at all.

US	52899907	R3HWDCOELYAAP1	4902075113	558628361	Night Voices, Night Journeys	Books	5	12	14	N	Y	Marvelous and original	In summary, Night Journeys, Nights Voices, subtitled Lairs of the Hidden Gods volume one, is urgently recommended to all serious mythos aficionados.<br /><br />Parenthetically, this book is part of a veritable avalanche of great new mythos and related books that have been popping up on my doorstep. Just in the last few months we have had Horrors Beyond and Lost Worlds of Space and Time, with Tales Out of Dunwich and The Tsathoggua Cycle soon to follow, not to mention the upcoming Arkham anthology, The Dagon Cycle, The Yig Cycle, The Cthulhuian Singularity, Unholy Dimensions and The Black Sutra.  Most of the stories in these will be new to me, even the reprints!  It's a golden age, I tell you.<br /><br />Night Voices, Night Journeys is a publication of Kurodahan Press, and is, I believe, POD.  The best way to order it is from Amazon, where it is $20 plus shipping.  The page count is a VERY generous 363.  However, 14 pages are taken up by introductions by Asamatsu Ken and Robert Price, and each story has its own title page and brief introduction, also by Robert Price.  And from page 289 onward the material is factual discussion of mythos manga and Lovecraftian fiction in Japan, with brief notes about the authors and translators at the end of the book.  Production qualities are good.  My copy had one printing error on page 301 where a crease led to a flaw in the typesetting, but the print was still readable.  The cover has a lovely painting by Yamada Akihiro of a Japanese sea demon hidden amidst flowering plants.  This is really quite different than the art style I am used to seeing on mythos books from the western world.  I found it quite striking; most mythos novels<br /><br />illustrations do not depict horror concealed in exquisite beauty.  This book was written a number of years previously for the Japanese horror market and I guess the success (or perhaps the quality) was sufficient to prompt an English language version.  Hence the anthology was edited by Asamatsu Ken, a Japanese author and HPL fan rather than one of the usual mythos crew here in the west.  For such a book to succeed in the west it is extraordinarily important to have an excellent translation, one that can not just change the words into English but can also portray the atmosphere the author was trying to convey, that can appropriately bring off the rhythm of the dialogue and use of slang, puns or other word play.  In many ways the translation is an expression of the interpretation of these intangibles by the interpreter, and the work in some ways becomes their own.  I know from reading The Iliad that two translators can derive entirely different language out of the same source work.  I confess I have only ever read a few works of fiction written by Japanese authors before (one book Miyamoto Musashi was from my days taking karate), so I don't have a great deal of experience in this forum.  The success of this book in the US will stand or fall with the quality of the translation as much as with the stories themselves.  Happily these seem to be superb translations.  The stories read seamlessly, naturally, allowing us to readily enter the author's worlds.  For once I have no complaints about the introductions by Price, which were thoughtful, well written and informative.  I would follow his advice, however, and not read the individual story introductions until after you have read the work in question, to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />In some ways this book is both frustrating and tantalizing.  These are new stories, written specifically for this anthology, much like with Horrors Beyond or Dead But Dreaming.  This means there are other works already extant in Japan that we know nothing about.  Here is an untapped mythos resource that I will only ever see as it is translated.  In a way that means I'll probably only see the cream of the crop, but I can't help wondering about jewels known only to Japanese fans. And it makes me wonder about mythos fiction from other countries.  We have many stories from the US and the UK, and now we are seeing some Australian fiction.  What about India or China, or any African nations?  Heck what about Russia or non English speaking Europe??  One thing HPL fans do is write their own mythos contributions.  This has kept the mythos alive and squirming over the years.  The tradition dates back to the days HPL first ever wrote a story and his friends leaped over themselves creating new entities and tomes.  As we only see fiction written by English speakers we are missing out!!  And this cuts both ways.  I would imagine very little mythos fiction beyond the hoary classics is translated into Japanese so the revisionist view of Derleth is not extant in Japan.  In fact it is HPL, the Lovecraft circle and Derleth, with of course whatever mythos heritage is native to Japan, that forms the basis of the Japanese mythos fiction here.  I wonder what Asamatsu Ken would think of the stories in Eldritch Blue or Dead But Dreaming.<br /><br />Fortunately for us English speaking fans this is the first volume of a projected 4 volume series.  I fervently hope that they sell well so we do, in fact, get to see all 4 volumes.<br /><br />Here are the contents:<br /><br />ASAMATSU Ken - Foreword: \\"Recollections of Tentacles\\"<br /><br />ASAMATSU Ken \\"The Plague of St. James Infirmary\\" translated by R.

When I relate my impressions of a story I like to place it in context with other related stories I have read.  For reasons alluded to above I cannot do that here; all my very old Derleth paperbacks and books by other Lovecraft Circle authors are hidden away in boxes somewhere.  I relied on Price's introductions to place each story in context, but only after I read it.  I must also say that the tenor of the anthology was intangibly different than other anthologies I have read recently, perhaps relating to the Japanese approach?  There was a sort of surreal, almost dreamy feel to many of the stories, even when they were graphic.  In some ways the horror was more detached.

Mr. Asamatsu uses a Japanese word \\"yoki\\" to good effect here; I doubt it translates well but it is rendered as gruesome feeling.  Yoki suffuses the pages, no doubt as the author intended.  Dreamlike, ghastly and compelling come to mind when reflecting on this story.  This is the one work where I did detect a bit of lecturing to Americans.  I mean the few paragraphs on the bottom of page 62-63, where American hypocrisy and lack of insight is paraded into the narrative.  This is, of course, old hat.  It was the only time I ever discerned anything like that, and I only bring it up for the sake of even handedness.<br /><br />*********spoiler follows!!!***********<br /><br />One very cool thing about this story was weaving into it some true historical figures and a venerable mythos fiction character of Henry Kuttner.  I never would have known about the latter except for Mr. Price's introduction as it has been ages since I read the Book of Iod.  Now we know the truth about Elliott Ness and Al Capone.  I wonder if the Japanese character Hasegawa Kaitaro is similarly a real person adapted for this novella.<br /><br />YAMADA Masaki\\"The Import of Tremors\\" - Oh what a good yarn this was, about some unspeakable entity trying to acquire a new host in the twilight of WWII.  I knew some of the history without prompting, like the Kobe earthquake, but I did not realize that Kobe was fire bombed like Tokyo was.<br /><br />KAMINO Okina \\"27 May 1945\\" translated by Steven P. VENTI - I would gather that the time of the military collapse in Japan in mid 1945 is used to good effect by horror writers in Japan.  This time is related to the American assault on Okinawa, and uses it as a smokescreen to a confrontation between Hastur and Cthulhu, very Derlethian!!  Also very well written!<br /><br />INOUE Masahiko \\"Night Voices, Night Journeys\\" - Surreal, beautifully written, this story gives the anthology its name.  Some night journeys are eternal.<br /><br />MURATA Motoi \\"Sacrifice\\" - In this story a yuppie-type's wife gets caught up in a cult that may use her as a sacrifice to a soil god.  Robert Price was right on the money when he compared it to the movie(and novel) The Wicker Man.  I was a bit bemused because that is what I came up with myself before I read his remarks.  Any way, this was perhaps the weakest story here, not bad just not as powerful as the others were for me.<br /><br />MAKINO Osamu \\"Necrophallus\\" - Oh my, wonderful!  For me this is the best story contained in the anthology.  And Horror Between the Sheets purports to be about mythos sex.  Hah! Makino's work was visionary!  \\"Necrophallus\\" probably outdoes anything in<br /><br />Eldritch Blue for combining sex and true mythosian horror.<br /><br />SHIBATA Yoshiki \\"Love for Who Speaks\\" - This is a marvelous tale of what are essentially The Deep Ones.  They call to their own.  A superb close to the superb fiction in Night Voices, Night Journeys.<br /><br />The rest of the book is nonfiction.<br /><br />Need I say that I thought this was a masterful collection?<br /><br />Congratulations to Mr. Asamatsu and his authors.

US	52899907	R2LAR9L1E7TMF7	1587152630	17740146	Balak	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Excellent mythos novel	Balak is a novel by Stephen Mark Rainey published in 2000 by Wildside Press.  I've had my copy sitting around forever; cover price is $16.95 US.  The cover painting is a stylized image<br />vaguely suggestive of a sinister entity, very effective.  I couldn't figure out who the artist was, even after looking through the entire book.  Production qualities are good.  Again, however, my copy is already showing some yellowing from aging.  Of course I don't keep my books in plastic wrap, but this still seems a bit early for this effect, although it is not as severe as The Gardens of Lucullus (2001), which is not as bad as Dead But Dreaming (2002).  Interestingly, Dagon by Chappell in the LSU Press edition has a little blurb on the title page about the book meeting standards from some sort of book longevity society; more power to 'em.  Page count is 236, a nice substantial book.<br /><br />Briefly, this is an excellent novel and is highly recommeded to all fans of mythos fiction, all the more so because it is a novel in a genre that better lends itself to the format of a short story.  This is what all us fans expect of Stephen Mark Rainey, well known for his many stories in various anthologies.<br /><br />Now spoilers will follow - you have been warned.<br /><br />First of all, I had picked this novel up a few years ago, and could not get into it.  The reason was that the protagonist, Claire Challis, had a 4 yr old son kidnapped.  I'm a father of 2 young boys and while I don't find generally horror fiction revolving around children personally offensive or off putting, the description that he was allowed to run away from his mommy, a responsible parent, in a busy grocery store in big city struck<br />me as absolutely grossly unbelievable (OK, this from a guy who is reading about giant alien entities....).  Any parent in this day and age knows you chase them down, give them a stern warning and the second time they either end up in the cart where you ignore their squalling, or else you march them out of the store, abandoning your shopping for the time being....Look, I'm just telling you why I set it aside for a few years.<br /><br />Well, Balak eventually worked its way back up to the top of my stack.  The title relates to Rainey's very clever use of Biblical scripture to create a character, Balak, an ancient priest of a terrible ancient being, Golgolith, who is now represented as one of the Old Ones.  Over the years Golgolith has granted power to Balak, who has done the same to his subordinates, through blood sacrifices that often involve<br />kidnapping of children.  Balak is no longer anything resembling human. His main servitors are a human pastor named Lazar and a freaky part human Nyle.<br /><br />A good prequel to this book would be The Music of Erich Zann.  In fact in the author's note in Rainey's collection of stories The Last Trumpet he describes an interest in the ability of music to change spiritual awareness or cause a heightening of perception.  This theme is threaded into Balak as well.<br /><br />A very appealing feature of Rainey's work is the well crafted prose and meticulous plotting.  Claire overhears a neighbor's child being kidnapped, it turns out, by Lazar, the pastor of the Church of the Seven Stars, where Balak has the real temple to Golgolith.  When she gets involved this sets events in motion that end up swallowing Claire, her boyfriend Mike Selby, his sister Nancy and eventually police detective Trotter.  Balak and Lazar set their intent on using Claire as the blood sacrifice who will allow Balak to finally open up a gate for Golgolith to enter our dimension.<br /><br />One thing about mythos fiction, even though it is horror, after all these years it is well, not very scary.  I remember being about 14, up late at night reading Winged Death, when a huge black wasp flew into my bedroom from a window, went straight to the light fixture and disappeared inside it never to be located again.  That made me jump!!  Rainey had one particular passage where Nancy and Claire are having dinner while examining a figurine of Golgoltih, and while Claire steps out of the room, suddenly Nancy and the figurine vanish, as she is captured by the malevolent forces from the church.  This gave me a real<br />frisson of excitement in a way mythos fiction has not for a long time.<br /><br />Events move along as first Claire and then Mike fall into the clutches of the Church of the Seven Stars, while Trotter looks for them.  The final several chapters are the culmination as Lazar, Nyle and Balak attempt the ritual that will open the gate for Golgolith.  The pace picks up as the book races to its exciting conclusion.  There are some nicely creepy desciptions of non human entities and torments ednured by the protagonists.  Here is where I have a little bit of a bone to pick with the story.  I can see where the police start destroying the 7<br />pointed internally lit up stars around the church, incidentally at first and then more deliberately as they begin to understand their implications.  It was totally internally consistent. I can also appreciate the way this works to obviate the ability of Balak to perform his ritual or even to banish the supernatural entities they have on church premises.  What I thought was a little too pat was how the principal bad guys fell on one another to destroy themselves so abruptly, clearing the way to the survival of the protagonists.  I could easily understand how Lazar was a pawn to be discarded to a terrible fate, but the demise of Nyle and the Sultan Tuskachimaqqua were just a bit too easy, contrived, I dunno.  The abandonment of even dedicated human servitors actually is true to mythos form and so I can see how Golgolith is either indifferent to the fate of Balak or was sadistically planning to cast him aside the entire millenia he was Golgoltih's chief minion on earth.  I guess it was the timing seeming too much at the service of the story to allow<br />Mike and Claire to get away that left me ever so slightly disgruntled.  A minor issue with a very good novel!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much I zipped right through the narrative in a few too-brief hours.  It is highly recommended to all fans of mythos fiction.  I will now turn my attention to The Last Trumpet, another book that I never got started on for some reason.  Based on this book and my enjoyment of practically everything Rainey has written, I have ordered The Lebo Coven, although I don't hink it is going to be a mythos tale.re having dinner while examining a figurine of Golgoltih, and while Claire steps out of the room, suddenly Nancy and the figurine vanish, as she is captured by the malevolent forces from the church.

US	52899907	R2DCV2PXAYUPBM	1840680873	486146000	The Starry Wisdom: A Tribute To H.P. Lovecraft	Books	1	9	18	N	Y	Overrated	I picked this up and read it a month or two ago.  It was originally published in 1995 by Creation Books, and I got a reprinted edition.  Likely it is familiar to most long time mythos fans.  The cost is less than $14.00, plus shipping.  Based on what I thought about it they should have paid me a similar amount to take it off their hands. Production qualities are good.<br /><br />Mostly it was a terrible mish mash of poorly written drivel.  The bulk of it was so bad that it tainted the rest for me.  For some reason the authors seem to think that using various words for body orifices is cutting edge.<br /><br />The only reason I can think of for anyone to buy it is the graphic version of Call of Cthulhu by John Coulthart.  And even this was maddening!  The artwork was exquisite, but it was presented in very cramped panels.  Enalarging this work to a few pictures or even one picture per page would have been worth every extra penny I had to pay.  As it was, the 2 page depiction or R'lyeh could not be laid out to really enjoy without breaking the spine of the book.  The fantastic details were lost in the tiny panels.  What a disappointment!  Maybe someday someone will reprint Mr. Coulthart's work in a more convivial form.<br /><br />Other than that I can honest to goodness think of no reason that I want to reread any of it.  Maybe I will try the Lumley and Campbell works again some day.  They were lost in the haze.  Price's story about Shub Niggurath was better than his usual product and is also available in the Shub Niggurath Cycle.<br /><br />Spend your Cthulhu bucks elsewhere, gang	2005-06-06

It was a rollicking good read.  Before I had found it I didn't know anything about Delta Green, as my RPG days are way behind me.  Now I am finding a whole sub genre of modern technothriller mythos action horror.  So far I have been blown away by Stross' story A Colder War, Goodfellow's novel Radiant Dawn and now Tynes' The Rules Of Engagement.  And it's not even the subject matter that's so good, it's the terrific writing that makes these such<br /><br />fun.  In all of them, the prose crackles particularly the dialogue, the plot whips along and the characters have depth and believability. And I also like the way in ROE that they don't specifically mention any monsters by name.  I don't think there was an 'Ia' in the whole book.  When Tynes describes the horrific encounter in the jungles of Cambodia as a flashback, the terror felt by the survivor is palpable.<br /><br />Verdict: rave review!<br /><br />Oh yes, there is one disturbing and unnecessary reference to a<br /><br />character named Matthew Carpenter who gets gunned down.  But other than that...	2005-06-06

I found it as big a let down as<br /><br />Nightmare's Disciple.  So far I have only managed to get about half way through and may just let it lapse into permanently unread status.<br /><br />For those who haven't read it some spoilers follow, but only mild ones as I don't have the gumption for a complete review of a book I disliked, and also because, well, I still don't know how it ends.<br /><br />My first complaint is that the novel is puported to be a Cthulhu<br /><br />mythos novel and, well, dammit, it isn't!  Nyarlathotep is invoked as the source of an evil breeding program but there is nothing Lovecraftian about it!  Similar to Nightmare's Disciple the name of an entity does not the mythos make.  For me the mythos is all about atmosphere, a sense of otherness, dawning of terror beyond imagining lurking at the fringes of the world, comprehension that the understood natural order of the universe isn't the reality, a sudden sense of the trivial status of humanity in the universe.  The inbred clan is inbred and deformed before they ever discover the floating coffin, they are<br /><br />evil before corrupted by contact with an alien entity.  Frankly there is nothing about the story that required using a mythos name except maybe marketing.<br /><br />Some other beefs: the characters are completely disinteresting.  There is nothing about them that makes you care one way or another, or even makes you bother trying to keep their names straight.<br /><br />I would say this is a schlocky gorefest kind of novel, but one without a captivating plot, characters with depth, particularly catchy prose or Lovecraftian atmophere. Now please, I don't mind gore if it has a point.  And well done prose that makes me shiver with disgust is always appreciated.  For example, Throne of Bones, the novella that gives this story collection its name, had pages of grotesque imagery of ghoulish feasting and sex.  It wasn't horrific, but a well thought out unpredictable plot, inventive prose and fun characters made it a fine read.  And it is not a Lovecraftish story.  Alas, for me, A Darkness Inbred did not deliver the goods.<br /><br />Not a mythos novel by a longshot.  What do you think makes a story Lovecraftian?houlish feasting and sex.

US	52899907	R19NJH4YDERWM0	068985756X	989051254	The Evil Elves (Moongobble & Me)	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Excellent for younger readers	Bruce Coville has once again written a story quite suitable for young fantasy fans.  I read to my 5 and 6 year old sons and they always enjoy the magical follies of the less than competent magicians.  The scary parts in the Moongobble series are not really scary, which is a plus, compared to Spiderwick where menacing goblins kill pets and dwarves, and some characters die.  The very young boy, Edward, being the hero makes it all the more interesting for children.  Also the language is much gentler than in Spiderwick.  (...)  As aways, the drawings added to the appeal as did the handsome production values with a volume sized perfectly for small readers' hands.  After the happy ending there is a great picture with all the kids' favorite characters, plus the opening for additional books even after Moongobble has fulfilled his Mighty Tasks.  May we hope for more, Mr. Coville?	2004-12-13

As I read it to them, they laughed out loud at Moongobble's magical failures and particularly his curses, \\"Dad rat monkey fat!\\"  There are many engaging illustrations, although I always wish for more in a book like this.  Particularly recommended to younger readers who aren't yet ready for Spiderwick.  Can't wait for the Evil Elves!	2004-11-29

There is a trend for kids' book series to have small handsome volumes with clever illustration, like Spiderwick and Lemony Snicket.  I had to edit out some disagreeable words in Spiderwick, and have decided to forego the Series of Unfortunate Events until they are older.  And some of Bruce Coville's books like the Magic Shop series don't really make comfortable reading for very young kids.  This is what makes Moongobble such a joy.  Following the example of Spiderwick these are nifty little hardback volumes filled with winning illustrations.  The stories are aimed at younger readers and my boys (beginning readers both) like to flip through the books themselves.  In The Dragon of Doom, my boys really got a kick out of Moongobble accidentally turning everything into cheese.  They also liked the talking toad.	2004-11-29

It really gives the flavor of market day in an Irish village.  What makes it so much better is the touching story of Tess' 7 year ol friend, Wee Boy, who has not grown since age 4.  He looks into a rabbit hutch and sadly wonders if he will be able to live in such a tiny house himself when he is grown up.  Tess feels sorry for him and takes him to a Fortune Teller, even though her mother told her people are only told what they want to hear.  Wee Boy's spirits soar after he hears his fortune and he and Tess spend the rest of the magical day together.  In fine Market Day fashion they make a deal to meet again next Market Day.  A delightful read for young and old!	2003-07-17
US	52899907	R2GC6YZIQEEEPN	067974830X	23862310	Nathan Bedford Forrest: A Biography	Books	2	25	32	N	Y	Frustrating	I agree with the other reviewers about the content.  General Forrest is a fascinating figure who must have been fearsome in battle.  He seems larger than life in many ways, most of them not at all admirable.  What is  frustrating and makes this book difficult to recommend is the almost  complete absence of maps.  Most of the described campaigns become  impossible to follow and read like so much word salad.  I resorted to  scouring my Civil War library for maps from other texts but other readers  might not be so lucky.  I don't understand why an editor would allow the  absence of maps so essential to enjoying a work like this.	2000-07-04

My 10 month old loves this book because when you squeeze the binding on just the right spot, the tiger on the cover opens his mouth and chomps his teeth.

I did not enjoy it as much as Sword's other works, for two reasons.  First, the maps were poor and not well situated throughout the text.  Often events were  described and the locations were not on any of the overall regional maps.  It was also difficult to find the relevant map so an index would have been  helpful.  Considering the main audience for this work is composed of Civil  War buffs, detailed and covenient maps should have been a top priority.  Second, I think there was some mild hyperbole used throughout, with verbs  chosen to unnecessarily sharpen the conflict between fueding generals.  Other than these points I thought this book was a wonderful exposition of  the siege of Chattanooga.  After reading it I will have to visit Missionary  Ridge all over again.  I highly recommend Sword's other books to the Civil  War enthusiast.	1999-05-06
US	52899907	R3MGP4HYTEFBRO	1854093746	534874307	The Armies of U.S. Grant	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	Useful but not essential	I purchased this book based on the strength of the last work by Arnold I read, Grant Wins The War.  Whereas that book was rich in detail and thoroughly covered all aspects of the Vicksburg campaign, this book was  more superficial.  I would not recommend it to anyone as a first reference  for any of Grant's battles.  Each campaign gets only the most superficial  coverage in terms of strategy, tactics and events during the fighting.  Shiloh merits only a few pages, for example.  The western theater battles  receive more detail than the eastern theater.  Arnold is a bit too  apologetic for Grant's leadership when he moved to the Army of the Potomac.  However I did find this work very useful for the rich and detailed  coverage of items of interest: tactics and training, weaponry, recruiting,  army organization, the soldiers' life, supply and the like.  Most books  about the Civil War years which I have read so far (more than 20 books)  were not so thorough on these points as Arnold.  So I found this book a  useful adjunct to Grant Wins The War.  I recommend that book as essential  reading to everyone, whereas The Armies of US Grant is more a supplement to  the Civil War aficianado.	1999-04-28

What a mistake!  It isn't about anything.  There is no plot!  There is no story!  The  characters are paper thin and there is no reason to care about any of them.  You will be glad to learn, however, that the author apparently spends a  good deal of time at state agricultural conferences.  I found nothing to  like but I guess I'm just one of the city slickers she rather lamely pokes  fun at...	1999-01-06

James Arnold includes quotations from journals, letters and newspapers to add to the immediacy of his writing.  The campaign for Vicksburg is laid out in detail, making the action easy to follow, but his style is never dull or tedious.  And it is not just a narrative.  There is lucid analysis of the strategies and actions of each of the major generals and political figures.  I found the approach very even handed in its praise and criticism.  I read this book over the course of 2 days because it was so absorbing (particularly since I live in Mississippi and I read during the time of the Battle of Champion Hill).  Arnold's arguement that this was the decisive battle in the war is cogently argued, although I suppose it will be controversial, as everything about the civil war is.	1998-05-20

I was bowled over by the first book and found each of the subsequent two volumes to be progressively more lame.  I fervently hope that does not happen here because this is the best science fiction book I've read in the last year or two.  Although Otherland has a rather ponderous length, it did not read like a long book.  The characters and situations were enormously inventive.  Unlike another recent novel about virtual reality, Snow Crash, Williams' characters are lifelike; you care about them.  They evolve and grow, and when they get hurt, you feel for them.  I don't know how accurate any of the snippets of Bushman culture are, but they added additional richness to an already deep tapestry.  One feature I particularly enjoyed was how Williams' brought all his disparate characters together; the plot lines converged seamlessly.  I am eager to see the next volume!	1998-01-19
US	52899907	R1808STYY22QBD	0553562614	445913	Snow Crash	Books	2	1	3	N	Y	Good start, weak finish	I mainly read fantasy with occasional forays into scifi.  I ordered this book on the strength of the acclaim from other readers.  For the first several chapters I really enjoyed the read, with the biting satire and ultra hip characters.  But the book  lost steam mid way through, and was a bit of a chore to finish.  Frankly the lectures on the nature of religion and verbal viruses were incredibly dull.  It ruined the momentum created by the fast paced beginning.  Also the humor virtually (pun intended) disappeared at the same time.  I kept anticipating another amusing vignette but it never happened.  As in many science fiction or fantasy hack jobs, the characters never rose above their stereotypic introductions.  My advice is to check it out in your local library.  When you get to the section involving the Librarian, if you still like it, then fork over the bucks for your own copy.  Me, I'm rereading Hyperion.	1998-01-19
