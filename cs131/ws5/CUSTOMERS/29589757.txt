Great book, although a prequel to Killer Angels Jeff Shaara captures his fathers ability to feel out these people who we see so two dimensional in history book's, although fiction, the thoughts and views can't be to far off.  I felt Lee's struggles, Chamberlains doubts and Jackson's faith as if I was each of them.  Gods and Generals is a good first book for Jeff and I am sure his stories will continue to improve.  Now I am reading The last full measure and am pleased.   Read Gods and Generals, the Civil War was never more alive.	2005-07-28

I can not say more about this book than has previously been said in other reviews.  I love history and a friend recommended it.  I waited almost a year and I am very sorry to not have read it sooner.  INCREDIBLE.  The characters are brought to life.  You see the battle through their eyes, the pain, the doubt, shame and joy.  The battle is non-fiction, the characters are non-fiction.  Michael Shaara just ficionalizes there thoughts.  With the exception of reading the Red Badge of Courage in High School, I have not read anything else about the civil war.  This book has hooked me.  I have begun Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara, the son.  I am hooked.  Read it. <br />	2005-07-15

Mr. St Aubyn has done his research.  This book is an excellent look into both the political and personal life of the long lived Prince of Wales and shortly King Edward VII.  He was mistakenly compared to George IV as a pleasure seeking playboy, which he apparently enjoyed his position in life but once he was King he set the stage of an era.  The Edwardian era.  He was underemployed by his mother who truly was a Hanover and kept her heir as her predecessors did, far from the throne and duties of the monarchy.  He and his wife provided a loving environment for their family and gave the people a royal to be proud of.  Highly recommend this book.	2005-07-06

Focuses primarily on the 7 Secretary Class cutters but tell some on all that served in the Atlantic.  His narrative is sprinkled with input of many survivors.  Those words make it real.  You feel the wet, tired and cold that they do and the fear and numbness of war in the convoys.  A great read.

Growing up in Eastern Washington, Foley was a familiar name but now I know why.  Great story of his life.  Mr. Biggs tells his tale, plus educates about the House of Representatives and the internal structure and processes.  Along the way are stories and brief interjections by Speaker Foley.  I learned a lot about Tom Foley, the House of Representatives and the process of legislation from this book.  Sometimes it is tough to get through parts because there is so much political process and information to digest but I enjoyed it.  Worth the read.	2005-06-15

The father of weather forecasts and explorer of South America.  Robert FitzRoy will be remembered by me.  This book tells us about a great British aristocrat who gave more than he took.  I love Patrick O'Brian and this could have been his but it is real story about a real person.  FitzRoy was a remarkable man who history has pushed back to the shadows and labeled Darwin's Captain.  FitzRoy, whose family is descended from Charles II, becomes a beloved British Man-o-war Captain, explorer, politician and eventual Vice Admiral.  Mr. Gribbin gives us a picture of one of the last explorers and scientific innovators who charts South America, tries to support native rights in New Zealand and gives the world weather forecasting, yet is forgotten.  His end did not justify his life.  He was an amazing man who deserved more. He was faithful to his family, his country and religion.  A good man and a great read.	2005-06-15

I read a Hard back copy from the local library and could not believe it.  I loved this bio.  I have read many other biographies and books on the Stuart and Hanover Dynasties of Britain but most were from Charles II and the pretenders and George III through Victoria.  George I seems to be remembered as the British King who really didn't care; He took his time accepting the throne, refused to learn English, ran away to Hanover every chance he got and only wanted English money proven by the South Sea Bubble scandal.  This book gives us more.  A lot more.  It shows the who and why, it dispels the stories I have listed above and gives us the man, flesh, blood and emotions.  He becomes a real and more understood human than just an uncaring figure from history.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great read.  I didn't want to put it down.  It flows easy and gives enough detail and background to keep you moving through history and his life without bogging you down.  All those, Jacobites included :) who do not know George I outside of the usual should read this book.  I can't say enough about it.	2005-06-15

Although it talks of Cumberland, he is but one of the many people viewed in this book.  Mr. Speck gives us the events and political actions of the rebellion of 45 and the culmination of &quot;the forty-five&quot; at Culloden.  It main focus is to show that the rebellion was not widely supported at all.  That the highland army massed about the Young Pretender was relatively large; they represented a small minority when compared to greater Scotland.  Mr. Speck shows that the Rebellion although feared was not supported and with any amount of resistance by George II and his administration it would have crumbled anyway.  Many modern historians seem to romanticize the Young Pretender and his run through Scotland but we see more of the follies he lead and the fluff created by time.  We also see that due to the &quot;Aggressive&quot; prosecution of the battle of Culloden the Jacobite rebellion all but ended and another rebellion never occurred.  Good book.  A bit tedious at times but nice to see a new point of view on an old and very important event in the history of Great Britain and especially Scotland and the Jacobites.	2003-11-04

It was great.  Mr. Reid tells all the background stories of all the players and then explains the movements as the battle unfolds.  We see into the characters of not only Prince Charles but of Adjutant General O'Sullivan, Lord George Murray, the Duke of Perth and other Jacobite Commanders.  The clans and their stories are touched on as is the French units and their histories. I learned of the battles of Falkirk and Prestopans and the Jacobites treatment of retreating soldiers helps to pave the way for their retribution at Culloden.  I also learned of the different regiments of the Government forces and there commanders under General Wade, the Duke of Cumberland and General Hawley.  Just a great book which helps you understand everything from the regimental colors on the British uniform to how each step of the battle unfolded.  Highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand Battle of Culloden and the events, which led up to it.  I think a person should read this book and then step into the highly detailed story by John Prebble called Culloden.	2003-10-25

Bonnie Prince Charlie.  This books starts with his coming of age in Rome and his father's (the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;) early failure to regain the throne for the Stuart Dynasty and his settling into a comfortable court in exile.  This biography gives good insight into his reasoning and struggles with the Scottish army through out the campaign of the &quot;Forty-Five&quot; Jacobite rebellion and subsequent defeat at Culloden.  The story does not end there.  We follow Prince Charles through his 3-month journey through Scotland and escape back to the continent.  His trials to continue the Jacobite cause and eventual settling down into a court of exile like his father.  A good story told from a more Jacobite view, but nice to see that some attention is paid to his life after Culloden.	2003-10-22

Since I began reading books about the Hanovers I have been greatly interested in the different traits of each of the predominant members of the family.  Yet many traits seem to carry on through the generations.  Two brothers, one loved by his parents and the other loathed.  One a politician and one a general.  One small and skinny and the other large and even larger.  14 years apart, yet both died at 44. This book let me see for the first time, Frederick, Prince of Wales.  He was in opposition against his father as in each generation.  He was a spoiled youth, but he had some interesting ideas about monarchy.  One could only imagine if he had taken the throne instead of his son.  His beliefs in the crown passed through Bute in a diluted form would have made the revolutionary era in America very different.  The possibility of splitting the British and Hanover crowns between his son's and even an American Peerage and possible 3 kingdom.  It is an interesting dream in the land of what-ifs.  Definitely some one I will read more on.  <BR>   Then we have another view of William &quot;the Butcher&quot; Cumberland.  I liked this view because Mr. Marples shows more of his personnel side.  His gambling and his mistresses show through.  It shows once again that he was a dedicated son and loyal subject to his king.  The horrors of Culloden and the destruction of the Highland ways were tragic, but for Cumberland to bear the brunt of this and be remembered as &quot;the Butcher&quot; is unfortunate.  He was 25 and following orders of his king and the advice of his peers and generals.  The Highland way was dying out in a more modern world and the Jacobites were once again taking advantage of there loyalties and since of duty to reclaim the throne.  William had to close the door and end the Jacobite threat once and for all.  The result was tragic, but in that time if you were told to stop the rebellion once and for all and close the door for further incidents, what would you do??? Atough question.  Cumberland was a man of duty and loyal to his father and nephew.  His early death is also tragic in that he could also have helped George III more and changed the Revolutionary era.  Great book and a great view of two often forgotten Hanovers.	2003-10-16

Labeled the butcher by Jacobites, William, Duke of Cumberland is remembered mainly for his command of the British army which defeated Charles Stuart, the young pretender at Culloden.  This book show's he was more than a butcher.  He was a devoted son, and friend to his father, George II.  He was the first Hanover Prince born in England.  He was a brilliant General and dedicated to his troops.  William even came to the aid of his nephew George III and helped set up a new government when most men would have just stayed in retirement.

There are numerous books on Queen Victoria and the Era she heralded, but there is little on King William IV, son of George III, younger brother and heir of George IV and previous monarch of his niece Queen Victoria.  King William saw England through only 7 years but in that seven years he saw a lot of changes in parliament and help begin restoring the faith of the British in their monarchy that was lost during the reign of George IV.  Mr. Ziegler does a wonderful job of showing William's private life and the trials he endured from his time in the Navy, to life with Mrs. Jordan and their 10 children, to his finding proper wife and becoming King.

I have been reading books on the Hanoverian dynasty in Britain.  This book is one of the few that gives the other side of the story of the Duke of Clarence (William IV).  It is also the only book that gives us a little insight into the 10 Fitzclarences (William's children by Dora).  William would have been a happy father and husband to Dora if it was for the fact his 2 older brothers would have produced an heir, but once the Princess of Whales died in childbirth, royal duty kicked in and William had to marry and follow the rules, (i.e. Acts of Parliament).  Dora was a strong woman and survived hard times in the spot light.  I would say leaving here was King William's greatest folly.  In my opinion, a love like that would be worth much more than a crown.  He had brothers with heirs that could carry on the dynasty (and ultimately did, Duke of Kent's Victoria).  Any student of Georgian Britain or the Hanoverian Dynasty, should read this book.	2003-07-30

Being American I was taught the typical view of \\"Crazy, tyrannical King George III\\", who forced the American colonies to rebel.  After reading this biography I have a new respect for George III.  He was a good and honest man in the things he tried to do.  He was sheltered and Royal so his view of the world was a little different than others.  He did his best for his nation and his family.  Maybe a little controlling in the fact of his Royal Marriage Act and how his son's had so many mistresses and natural children or the fact that his daughters, if they married at all they did it late in life.  This book makes me believe he probably would have been a happier man if he were just a country gentleman and/or farmer.  After reading this bio I do not believe he can be said to lack for love of his family or his country.  Parliament had more to do with the American Revolution than George III.  May more people read and see the good man George III tried to be, both in family life and as a national leader.	2003-07-19
