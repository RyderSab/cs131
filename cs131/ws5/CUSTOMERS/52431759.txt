This has to be the best book I have ever read and strongly suggest everyone read this to gain some outstanding skills and education about business and life...it is an absolute winner! Everyone after reading this book, will walk away with dozens of practical ideas that can be easily incorporated and practically implemented. It is information written in simple language that can be adopted by every business person. I'll be recommending it to all my friends whether self-employed or looking to forge a career for themselves. Through his common sense ideas and simple teachings, who knows how many lives Brian Sher will change for the better and the amount of success that will flow as a result.	2005-01-12

This book sometimes reminds me of \\"Who moved my cheese?\\" by Spencer Johnson and Kenneth H. Blanchard or even \\"7 spiritual laws of success\\" by Deepak Chopra. But this book is different. \\"The Art of Possibility\\" does not offer a quick path to wealth. The authors show us that inspiration does come from every-day events. The book invites you to see life from a different perspective, if you wish so. This book is certainly a great start to freeing up one's brain and thinking process. I highly recommend \\"The Art of Possibility\\" to anybody seriously seeking to release their full potential from the control of our human conditioning. This is really a wise book about transforming yourself and others.  <br />	2004-12-21

The authors speak some serious truths about advertising and how it is misused and overused and about public relations and how it is under-used. Here is the book's essential idea: advertising can't buy you a brand identity, and if you try to spend your way to it, you will just be throwing your money away. The book explains why and along the way you pick up how to build a brand, what advertising is designed for, and learn a lot about ad agencies and how they believe that their job begins and ends at being creative without regard to whether the ad agency's product makes the client money. It supplies the reader an ample supply of helpful hypotheses, graphs, stats, and insight, into the world of Advertising and PR. I found this book to be both educational and helpful. It's a fun read, and if it doesn't make you sit back and take a long look at your own strategic thinking, maybe you should read it again. <br />	2004-12-19

It explains everything so clearly that even as dumb person as me can kind of understand it. This is just about the best non-fiction book I have ever read, and Bill Bryson is one of the best authors working in the field today. I found this book eminently readable - at once entertaining and informative. It is fascinating and a good way to observe life from a new set of perspectives. I'm sure, Bill Bryson wrote this book because he didn't think science should be boring. And in this book, it isn't. It is quite enough humorous. Enjoy the book.	2004-03-04

I have read a lot of financial books. Most of them are good, a few not so good. Some are not worth the paper they were printed on. I want to evidence, that Dave Bach has written an excellent book on how to get your financial house in order. In The Automatic Millionaire, Bach's keystone principle is to pay yourself first. This is not original at all. Stanley and Danko talk about this in The Millionaire Next Door. Givens taught this in More Wealth Without Risk and George Clason is perhaps the best known for teaching this in The Richest Man in Babylon. Robert Kiyosaki repeats this idea in every book of his Rich Dad's series. Once again, it's not news. But how many people really do it?<br />I thought I'd give you one piece of advice, and it might be the best piece of investment advice you'll ever hear. There aren't very many easy ways to get rich. As someone once said, \\"Real money is easy to come by; it just takes a lifetime of work.\\" But the miracle of compound interest is one of them. Over the last 75 years, the US stock market has averaged an 8% annual return. If you put $100 each month into a mutual fund, which mirrors the broad market, and started doing that in your twenties or early thirties, and the market averages the same rate of return, you would have a million dollars after forty years. You can do this with a deduction from your savings account each month so that it's automatic. When the market is up and over-valued, your $100 buys fewer shares. When the market is down and under-valued, it buys more shares. Over the long term, you optimize your purchase price for stocks and further increase your return. Over the last 25 years, the US market has actually returned almost 12%, so this would work even faster. This is a great and simple automatic way to invest. Unfortunately, too many even very knowledgeable investors don't pay attention to this one little investing trick.<br />The Automatic Millionaire is an excellent book to teach how to reduce debt and accumulate wealth. I really like the idea of automating finances as much as possible. Dave Bach has numerous suggestions in his books that seems very helpful. I especially liked the way the author lists practical \\"Action Steps\\" at the end of each chapter. This book is an easy read. The Automatic Millionaire makes your personal financial planning simple. You have both the time and the money to make your dreams reality. And then you automate it, and with peace of mind, you can move on to the things in life that you really enjoy. Thank you Dave for sharing.	2004-03-04

Energy is a basic aspect of existence that is not well understood in relation to individual and corporate performance. To realize your energy you must point on the idea &quot;We become what we think.&quot; Only in developing, supporting, and applying your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual &quot;muscles&quot;, you become &quot;fully engaged.&quot; This is the only way of programming your mental computer. <br />Your life isn't a persistent marathon, it's rather a series of sprints. To be successful, you need to balance recovery time with actual sprinting. The greatest players developed rituals to help relax themselves in the short time between points. The less successful players didn't have rituals to help them recover between points. Their heart rates remained high between points, and they couldn't seem to calm their stress.<br />After reading just the first chapters, I found Loehr and Schwartz to be full of wonderful knowledge. The reading alone caused my energy to increase. This book will give you real tools to manage effectively your energy. With simple explanations and stories that every reader can relate to. So everybody should read this book. You'll be amazed at all the unproductive thinking habits you have developed. <br />I highly recommend it to those who wants to improve the quality of their professional and personal lives.<br />Alexander Petrochenkov	2003-06-12

He walks a fine line and his sound advice should be followed to the letter. <BR>This book has good information and is very good for people with limited marketing experience and ideas.

Peter Hupalo is a consultant and frequent columnist on money and entrepreneurship matters. With clear and convincing data to support him, Mr. Hupalo debunks many of the myths Wall Street pushes on the investing public. Author demonstrates the futility of trying to \\"beat the market\\", whether through stock picking and market timing or by following mutual funds that have shown high levels of performance in the past. After he makes a convincing case for trying to meet, rather than beat the market. Thus, Mr. Hupalo advocates investing in a diversified basket of mutual funds. The chapter on investing during retirement is particularly insightful. <br />Whether or not one ultimately agrees with Mr. Hupalo's point of view, \\"Becoming An Investor: Building Wealth By Investing In Stocks, Bonds, And Mutual Funds\\" is a book, which deserves attention. Anyone wishing to base his/her investment decisions on solid methodology needs to read this book. You will have a much clearer understanding of markets, and your investment decisions will be firmly rooted in proven soil.<br />I highly recommend this book for everyone.<br />Alexander Petrochenkov	2003-01-15

I have just finished Dr Elder's new book, &quot;Come Into My Trading Room&quot; and have enjoyed it very much too. There are several new ideas in the new book. A lot of the material in this book was presented in &quot;Trading for a Living&quot;. It is the best book that combined the 3Ms -- Mind, Method and Money Management -- required for successful traders. It expands on the methods presented in &quot;Trading for a Living&quot; and makes the triple screen concept very clear. <br />I think the great difference between this book and other trading books is Dr Elder's background as a psychiatrist. He provides valuable insights into understanding the human element of market behavior, and the individual trader that makes his work unique. Dr Elder shares his own, successful trading strategy in a clear, concise, and easy to understand style. He does a great job showing some of his successful trades. I'm sure this is one of the finest books on developing trading skills. It is not only fun and easy to read but it is profitable. It pays back.	2002-12-19

But the end chapter \\"The Holy Grail Of Publishing\\" about the valuation of a copyright and intellectual property - is just perfect. I never read something similar. The chapter \\"Just-In-Time Inventory: How Many Copies Should You Print\\" is also very interesting and substantial. It gives Mr. Hupalo as an author of two other perfect books \\"Thinking Like an Entrepreneur\\" and \\"Becoming An Investor\\".<br />As a writer I'm trying to decide whether I want to self-publish or go through the more traditional publishing channels. Mr. Hupalo book has answered the myriad of questions I had, and given me specific detailed recommendations how to proceed with my manuscript. If I do choose to self-publish or to start and run my own publishing company, I know this book will become my constant companion.

That's right! All Kiyosaki's books repeat the same general theme a lot of times. But this is a secret of his doubtless success: the hypnotic shaman repetition serves for deep adaptation of his simple ideas. And the simplicity of his suggested message is making these books both powerful, and popular. <br />Kiyosaki's receipt to become wealthy is very simple. To be collected into a short list of ideas, it is just a half page long.<br />--- There are a lot of ways to earn money. But to become wealthy you cannot work for money. You must have the money work for you. <BR>--- To force money to work for you, you have to be a business owner, who owns assets than make a cash flow, or an investor, who invests in those assets. Your Cashflow Qudrants are (B) and (I).<BR>--- Become financially literate. Have a basic understanding of how assets create income, and liabilities create expenses. Then, simply collect assets.<BR>--- Once financially literate, hire the best advisors who can help you to play the game. Don't penny pinch on financial advice; good advisors will pay for themselves.<BR>--- Don't let the government needlessly take your money by taxes. First earn cash then spend. Start a corporation and legally pay taxes after expenses. Earn, spend then tax.<BR>--- Start small and learn from your mistakes. Learn, learn and learn. \\"The only difference between a rich person and a poor person is what they do in their spare time.\\" - said Kiyosaki. <BR>--- Become a sophisticated investors who is willing to take educated risks. \\"True investors make more money in bad markets.\\" - said Kiyosaki.<BR>--- Don't take on debt that will not take care of itself. If you take risk, make sure you get paid for it, just like banks do. <br />This is good reading for anyone willing to change the way he/she thinks about money and success so that financial freedom can be achieved. I find Kiyosaki's explanations to be helpful and clear.	2002-10-17

He is Russian origin and today he is well-known in Russia after his Moscow course of lectures on short-term investment in 1996. This book is translated into Russian and was published twice in Moscow ... <br />The first half of the book is pure psychology. The stock market in fact is a reflection of the human psychology. As the author points out, so many people who are educated think that because they are \\"school smart\\" that they must be able to master the financial markets just as well. It's the psychology and the mentality that goes into it. The author likens a typical losing trader (in other words, most traders!) to an alcoholic in denial. Traders are addicted to losing money. They get such a thrill from trading that they don't care if they win or lose. <br />The second half (Trading for a Living) is the core of the book. It is various trading strategies and technical information. If you're an experienced trader, you'll recognize most of it. The rule is simple: \\"buy low, sell high\\" or \\"short high, cover low\\". I think the author did an excellent job of covering a wide variety of strategies and trading tools. If you are new to trading, it may confuse the daylights out of you. <br />This book is a must have for anyone venturing into online trading. Dr. Elder lays out the three essentials of becoming a successful trader: Mind, Method and Money Management. <br />1. Mind: The psychological aspect of trading. Tells you to observe your own emotions as you trade. <BR><BR>2. Method: Technical analysis. Almost every major indicator is discussed here. <BR><BR>3. Money Management: Gives you some tips on how much to risk.<br />I have found a lot more detail in this book than in any other I've read so far. It is very enlightning. I give the book five stars. It is really good. If you don't mind the high price, buy it. It pays. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it to those traders who wants to improve the quality of their lives.<br />Alexander Petrochenkov	2002-10-17

Books	5	5	8	N	N	Toggle Your Mind Into Riches	This is a hypnotic book on mindsets. This is a work of art. This is a very dull book. And at the same time this is the best book by Robert Kiyosaki I've read. His method to form an idea is a continuous repeating. He repeats, and repeats again a lot of times. Like a musical composition of minimalism style. Like a Bolero by Maurice Ravel. Again and again. Repeat and repeat.<br />In his third book \\"Rich Dad's Guide to Investing\\", Kiyosaki tells how he got started in his investment journey, starting with nothing, and in fact with a negative net worth. I still like his style of writing and message.<br />Most of us, having read his first two books, would have wondered if we could have embarked on our journey to become financially independent without much resource at hand. In this book, Kiyosaki shows how anyone can get started and how it does not take money to make money. He teaches how time is more important than money. How investing in one's self and getting an education and experience precedes excessive cash. How having a plan is more important than being in a hurry to make money.	2002-10-17

Mr. Fridson explores the histories the ultra-successful as actions of extraordinary businessmen operating in the ordinary economy.<br />Mr. Fridson is a Merrill Lynch Managing Director. An important caution for the individuals in the investment field: author points out and proves that to accumulate billions just by investments is not possible. He proves that to achieve billions in the investment field, one must acquire a substantial stake in a company and control the management and the direction of the company as a whole. This is precisely what Warren Buffet has accomplished, in despite of the common myth that he is just an investor.<br />If you have intention to try to get billions for the first step read this book.

I read the book and incorporated its basic message into my daily life. Especially important is calculation of the value of saved money: a dollar (or Russian ruble) saved is one that has escaped taxes and the demands of living.

And it's rare that a movie follows the plot of a novel so  closely.<br />It is difficult to write something about a story that is so well  known, basically by its adaptation for the screen, which has been buried  under a heap of Academy Awards.

The FBI's chief of Behavioral  Science has called on her to help solve a serial murder case. She must  interview Dr. Hannibal (&quot;the Cannibal&quot;) Lector, a psychiatrist  jailed for killing and eating various patients, to get inside the mind of  Buffalo Bill, a serial killer on the loose. Starling becomes close to  Lector who helps her discover how to find Buffalo Bill, and how to find  closure in her personal life.<br />\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is simply a  superb, electrifying book. What a writer Thomas Harris is and what a  character the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector is.

If you haven't seen the movie yet, read  the novel first, then see the characters brought to life brilliantly by  Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.

But do you know how to make your money work for you -- to  manage it, keep more of it, make it grow and protect it so you can enjoy  it? There's plenty of financial information available -- magazines, books,  newspapers, radio, television and the Internet. There are hundreds of  financial companies trying to sell you their products and services. The  problem isn't finding enough information, it's finding too much. <br />I've  checked out many books on basic financial advice and the &quot;100  Questions You Should Ask About Your Personal Finances: And the Answers You  Need to Help You Save, Invest, and Grow Your Money&quot; by Ilyce Glink is  one of the best of the bunch.

Books	5	16	19	N	N	Truly Great and Remarkable	In his 1st book &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; (RDPD), Robert Kiyosaki addressed the drastic differences in mindsets between the Rich and the  Poor. The world change. And we have to change with it. Most people, I am  sorry to see, are way behind. &quot;Graduate from school, then graduate  from university, get a good job, buy a big home, on and on&quot;. This  &quot;poor&quot; formula will not work anymore. Buy this book and simply  get updated to the new financial world. The book is long enough (over 200  pgs), and I found myself getting impatient at times. But after reading it  all the way through, I find myself planning to read it again. I would  advise anyone buying this book to sit down after reading it and think over  your life and then start making a financial plan for your new rich life. Be  patient with this book and after reading it through, read it again and take  notes, and by all means take action. It is worth reading again and  again.<br />I give it 5 big stars because RDPD just make good sense. Sure, for  some (specifically, those that are already financially literate) Kiyosaki's  points are too simplistic (assets vs. liabilities, buy assets instead of  &quot;doodads&quot;), but for the majority of people seeped in credit card  debt, this making us virtually slaves to our employers and to the  government, his book provides excellent guidance for getting out of the Rat  Race, and starting to take charge of our personal way of life.<br />I liked  the ideas in this book, they excited me and made me tell all my family and  friends about it. My wife is not reading English. So, during our evening  walks I told her the RDPD chapter by chapter. And she was listening it with  great attention and was really excited with the financial ideas of Robert  Kiyosaki. I think, RDPD is the must reading for a lot of people all over  the world, and particularly for everybody in ex-communist countries. This  should be required high school reading material.<br />If you're notrich then  read this! The book is truly inspirational. Kiyosaki explains exactly how  you need to think. &quot;The more control you have over the way you achieve  your income, the more control you have over your life.&quot; Thanks,  Robert, your RDPD is really good reading!	2000-08-16

It is evident that he uses  computers, not just teaches them. Great book, easy to read, easy to use,  and well worth the minimal investment.	2000-05-12

It examines the current state of the magazine publishing industry in the USA  -- social, technological, economic, etc. <br />This book contains everything  you need to know to gain a solid working knowlege of the magazine industry.  But it is for professionals, not for startups. Maybe it reads like a  textbook for students than for someone looking for starting an independent  zine or cheap newsletter. But this book means big business and recomends  that you shouldn't try making a magazine unless you have half a million  dollars or so. Maybe it sounds not too inspirational for startups but it is  honest. <br />Five years I'm working in this industry in Russia. And I can  tell you that this book is written in an interesting manner and this is an  excellent introduction to professional magazine publishing.	2000-05-10

Most of the tips given by the author are not a commonsense at all. There's a lot of things I simply didn't know. What I didn't like in this book was  Mr.  Perlstein's tendency to engage in endless, ethnically rich lyrical  deviations about his grandma tales and his rather extended...family.  But the 'Solo Success' is well-written, entertaining, and packed with  practical tips and useful ideas. So I hope to return to the book now and  then. This book is a good inspiration for everyone who plans to work solo...	2000-05-10

Ask anyonewho works on their zine -- it's a passion. This is true and I wouldlike to confirm these words from the first page of the Make A Zine! <br />20 years ago, when I was young and the Soviet Union was still struggling for communism, I co-published with my friends a jazz zine. It was real SAMIZDAT -- an illegal self-published independent zine. We printed it on the electric type writer with print out of 50 copies or so. It was dangerous but it was passion. Today I am working for a popular computer magazine -- and it is just a good job, not more.<br />This book is destined to be the starting point of an independent magazine self-publishing. You will find the answers to virtually any question you have regarding how to self-publish zine or e-zine. And it's fun to read even if you don't want to publish. <br />Bill Brent gives the best introduction to layout, typography, stats, and design I've ever seen. But he also pays too much attention to his sex zines. In appendix of the book there is a good directory of stores and zine distributors (esp. sex-positive), but valuable in the USA only. <br />Now, in the time of the e-zine explosion, veteran and novice zine editors alike are discovering the joys of paperless publishing. With Internet pulishing everyone is absolutelly independent and free, and there are no expensive print or postage bills. <br />So, make your zines, ladies and genlemen. And I believe computers &amp; Internet someday destroy any ...totalitarian state.	2000-04-28

But, unfortunately, I found it very  basic. I think that this book is best for people who are just beginning to  explore natural health. <br />Buy this book if you want the real facts of  nutrition. But I was really hoping for more. So I guess I would recommend  the book, but not highly, because it's just too intellectual and not a  practical enough guide. <br />What is especially cool is that Dr. Andrew Weil  invites his readers to visit his website and share our experiences on his  program. Are you ready? Sure, I don't.	2000-04-24

This book also gives a nice rational on why it's OK to throw away items and you don't feel like you wasted money. <br />And also this is a perfectly organized book -- it tells you how to get the room  clean and then how to maintain. The real-life examples are nice so that you  don't feel like you are the only person who lets their stuff overwhelm  them. <br />I would recommend the book for everybody.	2000-04-24

So many books published in the last years introduce or exploit a new buzzword, have three pages of interesting content, and then go on for another 300 pages of  filler. As a result, I've become reluctant to read business books published  recently. <br />But 'Working Solo' goes beyond buzzwords. Over the next few  years Terri Lonier's book and her ideas will be an extremely valuable  resource in efforts of many people searching freedom and financial success  with their own home business.<br />This book is a gem. Going solo--in a  company with your home PC--has never been such an attractive workplace  option as it is right now. Computers plus communications creating a new  fruitfull environment for personal business of every men/women. 'Working  Solo' is the perfect guide for the new breed of entrepreneurs who will  create the new products, markets, and services for the 21st century.  <br />Thank you for the new path to the personal freedom and success, Terri!	2000-04-20

Huff gives you practical advice on how to work from home and take care of your family. But if you were a degreed professional prior to being a mom, this is not the book for you. But according to the book, you  should pursue a home business in candlemaking or crafts. But this is the  2000's, not the 1950's, Priscilla! Many of young professionals are educated  in far different arenas than were portrayed here! And I also agree with a  reader from Illinois: If you already have the credentials to run your own  home health agency, you don't need this book to suggest it. And if you  don't this suggestion is worthless. <br />Take my advice, ladies, do not buy  this book. There are a lot of the generic home-based business books; with  the careers outlined in them, you might actually have the opportunity to  make a great home business.	2000-03-02
