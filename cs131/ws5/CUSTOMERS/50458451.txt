US	50458451	R32VUK1XYP2GFT	1593080379	272128361	Notes from Underground, The Double and Other Stories (B&N Classics)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Deeply inciteful into the human conscious and a great sampling of this author	What makes this a promising edition is the notes and introduction, in addition to the great stories by Russian writer Dosteovsky. Dubbed a writer whose works include the element of socialism and psychology, this handy book is a great sampling of some of his shorter stories and novellas.  <br /> <br />Psychological and symbolic in nature, one of the stories, \\"The Double\\" is the story of a man who literally believes that he has a double, a man who looks like him and bears the same name of Golyadkin. Therefore, our protagonist becomes Golyadkin senior, and the antagonist, the \\"malevolent\\" side of the twin, is Golyadkin junior. Golyadkin becomes aware that this twin of his is methodically ruining his life by scarring his reputation with peers and making his own name become synonymous with shame. The story itself is a study in duality and shame of individuals-Golyadkin senior becomes obsessed with correcting all the wrongs that his lower twin creates and tries to become the highly thought of individual that he once was. His downfall, and lowering place in society, is as much physical to him as it is metaphorical to us the readers. While the story takes a little patience to begin to appreciate and understand, the overall impact is impressive.  <br /> <br />Also included within this edition are other stories from Dostoevsky, such as \\"Notes from Underground\\", \\"White Nights\\", \\"The Meek One\\", and \\"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man.\\" Also included is both a brief introduction to all the stories, as well as a timeline and information about the author.This is recommended, specifically for the reason that you get a great sampling of this author for a relatively cheap price. My only small qualm with the book is the very small print; hence 4 stars instead of 5.  <br />	2005-07-14
US	50458451	RC2062KYERCIT	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Unique story, but hardly merits a deeply philosophical badge of honor	As far as books go, I found that this is an interesting read, at least the premise of a young boy trying to stay alive while on board with a tiger certainly seemed intriguing. Like many others, and hopefully I won't belabor the point, I just didn't get the whole idea that somehow this story that the author tells has some majestically religious message of faith. I enjoy spiritual books and love novels the same, but the link just didn't fit in this story. Maybe I just didn't get it, but the high praise others have given to the book kind of made me a little shocked at this notion. <br /> <br />This book does have its uniqueness and personable feel to it, but some parts lack depth. I certainly liked the way the young boy's story comes into being, as well as much of the background about him and his family, but some of the other parts of the writing were unfulfilling. It is a bit detailed in some of the parts, such as the scenes where Pi is learning how to fish, and killing other animals in the sea for survival, but some of these parts are overly graphic. Moreover, the shocking details of Pi's eating habits, as well as the deaths of several of the animals on board the boat were a little excessive. <br /> <br />This read is definitely one in which you must stretch your logic as far as it goes, or at least try to take things as being symbolic in nature. The part with the blind man on the boat, as well as the events on the island that is \\"killing\\" animals seem a bit outlandish. **(Warning: Spoiler)** Later, when the author is being questioned by the two men, and makes up this fantastically detailed and gruesome story involving his parents and the man on the boat, are we to believe that the entire story he tells is only just a symbolic part of the story, and that it was all made up? Sure, it could have been symbolic, but for a writer to tell an entire story for 300 plus pages and then make up another story is as bad as an author ending a story with someone waking up from a dream. The two stories being linked by one of the men seems interesting, but I just felt like this ending could have been so much more. The questioning at the end seems a little strange also, as well as some of Pi's remarks and questions (for instance, what is up with him asking if he can have chocolate cookies repeatedly?) It really seems as though the author was making a concentrated effort to just finish the book abruptly. <br /> <br />Truth be told, I actually found the early part with Piscine learning about religion and faith, and practicing several religions, and his role in his father's zoo to be one of the more refreshing parts of the novel, but this is quickly abandoned about one-third of the way in after the boating accident.  <br /> <br />Overall, this novel is a quick, easy read, and unique in its own right and premise. However, there were too many parts that leave the story as a larger fable than a spiritual and insightful read.  <br />	2005-07-07

After one of his classmates \\"dies\\", he is given a strange gift from the mysterious janitor at his school-a metal glove. What he doesn't know is that this glove is going to open up a world full of bigger mysteries and adventures for him. After this happens, life is definitely not boring anymore.  <br /> <br />There are many questions that Jason wants answered, and as he progresses through the story he finds out that the question \\"Who Am I?\\" is sometimes a more difficult question to answer than one might believe.  <br /> <br />This book is definitely great for a younger reader who is interested in books that cover the spectrum of fantasy and science-fiction. It also seems to fit into the category of the \\"reluctant\\" reader because it is a story that captures a good deal of imagination.  I actually ended up buying the unabridged audio cassette for this book because I wanted to use this for one of the classes that I teach. The narration of the book on the cassette is done fairly accurately, but it is the same person reading the entire book, meaning all the parts, male or female, and at times the reader does not seem to change his voice to \\"become\\" other characters.  <br /> <br />Overall, it is a fairly simple story, but it is a quick easy read, and it should interest most teenage readers who might not be interested in the classics. Those who want a little more depth to a story (and a little more believability in a story) might want to pass, however.  <br /> <br />Rating: 3  stars  <br />	2005-07-02

At times, Larson bogs you down with too much less-than-important information.  I think one reviewer mentioned the abundance of names thrown at you when you are trying to keep track of some of the main ones who are involved in the World Fair's proceedings. <br /> <br /> Historically, however, this book is quite reflective and informative, and interesting in that regard. For instance, the fact that the Fair's inspiration was drawn from the building of the Eiffel Tower was an interesting factoid. This is where Burnham, the main architect for the fair, drew most of his inspiration in trying to \\"out Eiffel Eiffel.\\"  Also, the stories about the Daniel Burnham's drive to keep the fair's progress going, as well as the pressures to make it to the building deadline were quite revealing and informative.  There are many times that Larson gives you an abundance of visuals about the fair and its magnificence and then relates it to interests and fads of the time. He also gives you tidbits of information about other developments going on during this time (for instance, the facts about a man named Ferris building the first Ferris Wheel and its impact on the fair), and he really is able to paint a picture of the Fair's quality. Larson has a natural way of being able to combine the development and progression of the fair with the story of serial killer H. H. Holmes, using Chicago's urban boom as one of the significant factors.  <br /> <br /> Larson tries to be as honest and detailed about his research about Chicago's World Fair and the people who made it happen as possible (which he presents in the afterward), and takes these facts to tell some historically accurate details about Holmes, who was menacingly lurking unnoticed and anonymous behind the hoopla surrounding the World Fair. Still, he is able to make this a creatively unique work, and keep the stories interesting for the most part.  <br /> <br />If you are into historically-based reads, then this is a great book for leisurely reading, especially summer type reading. If you aren't into much non-fiction, then it might be a little more challenging, yet unique, work to get through.  <br />	2005-06-30

Through your exploits and conquests the great deeds of chivalry still pervade our consciousness. Don Quixote, you, who suffer the occurrences of malignant and frequent enchanters, whose sole objective is to persecute you, still remain wholeheartedly the one who exists and lives for the greater good of honor and for your beautiful lady, Dulcinea. Do endeavor to continue this great history, and sally forth with your loyal and droll squire Sancho Panza to conquer the evils that flourish within our world!<br /><br />Miguel Cervantes' Don Quixote has been dubbed many things: 1) the greatest book in the Modern English language, 2) a bitter satire aimed at dispelling the superfluous books on the theme of chivalry and romance,  3) an adventure tale with master and servant going forth into the world in search of conquests. It would be accurate to say this work is all these and then some.<br /><br />We may or may not think only of the \\"windmill\\" scene when the book Don Quixote is mentioned, but this is only one part of a book so rich in characters, details, adventures, and prose that, even though it a rather lengthy \\"classic,\\" it is hard to put down. Perhaps this is because Cervantes does an excellent job of intertwining comedy and adventure, illusion and reality, satire and seriousness, in the knight's exploits. The book delves into the notion that chivalry and honor can be a form of madness.<br /><br />The differences between Don Quixote and his loyal squire, Sancho, are quite apparent. Sancho, although labeled simple and dense, transforms in some respects from the beginning to the book's second part. Although he keeps his realistic view of the world, he is able to acquire the role of governor (at least in his mind), and he begins to come to a better understanding of Don Quixote's view of knight errantry. Don Quixote, meanwhile, lives in an idealistic world for most of the book, and believes that forces outside his control (such as enchanters, evil, etc) are the reason for their many disasters and ordeals. He truly believes that an ideal world will exist if he follows the rules of knight-errantry. Even when he feels he is beaten, he continually strives to do pick himself up: \\"I risked everything for adventure; I did my best, and was overthrown, and though it cost me my honor, I did not lose, nor could I lose my integrity, and I can still fulfill my promise.\\" (pg 1000)<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the novel was the adventures with the Duke and the Duchess. They concoct such an extravagant illusion to get Don Quixote and Sancho to believe in their roles of honor and worth, presenting Don Quixote excessive illusions to confirm his greatness and Sancho with his long-awaited role of governorship. However, along the way to doing this, there seems to be a feeling that the duke and the duchess are seemingly the \\"crazy\\" ones because of the depth to which they go to keep this illusion alive. The importance that Don Quixote and Sancho exert is depicted during the Duke and Duchess' games because there is a sense that they never want the adventure to end also, even if it is just a gag, and so they become almost equals in certain respects to the knight and his squire.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable and fun tale, one that will have you laughing out loud sometimes. Entertaining, funny, and wonderfully written, Don Quixote is one of the best classics out there, and , although quite lengthy, it is a book that can be picked up after a while and continued because each chapter is another story.control (such as enchanters, evil, etc) are the reason for their many disasters and ordeals.

US	50458451	R2H2776M2U23CG	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	The Dark Side of Human Nature	Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of English boy who get marooned on an island after their plane crashes during war time. None of the adults survive so they are left there to survive on their own. One of the boys, Ralph, is quickly chosen as the chief leader of the group over the book's antagonist, Jack. At one point, while exploring the island, the kids see something they believe is a beast. Later, Jack, Roger and Ralph see something that they believe is a beast, and so, there becomes an emphasis to find out exactly what it is. The fear of the \\"beast\\" is probably one of the main issues in Golding's work, because it creates the breakdown of their ability to work towards rescue. Eventually Ralph's authority over the others diminishes, and he cannot control the malevolent tendencies of Jack, who, impatient with Ralph's ideas, eventually breaks off and forms his own \\"tribe.\\" Two of the boys, Piggy and Simon, stay loyal to Ralph while one by one the others leave Ralph's group. While Piggy is intelligent and Simon is individualistic they both have trouble enforcing leadership, and so Ralph's cause to keep the fire going becomes less and less important to the others.  Jack's group gets more and more brutal and rebellious, hunting pigs and using clay to look the role of a tribe. Chaos and disorder ensue, and the brutality of individuals without rules surfaces.<br /><br />While this story is more symbolic than anything else, what was refreshing was Golding's ability to create well-rounded characters. Each of the main characters (Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Samneric, Roger) are depicted effectively both from the dialogue and writing style. Golding is not the type of author that is just going to come out and tell you something about a character or situation; many times you have to make up your own judgment and inferences about motives and dig for some type of meaning.<br /><br />What also makes this book powerful is the several poignant issues it brings up. First of all, Golding examines the issue of what it would be like to have to survive in a situation where you are surrounded by peers, where laws are not part of the society. He seems to be making a pessimistic inference about how we operate when we let chaos or fear control ourselves, rather than being rational and objective towards common goals. Some of us may have at one point thought of the idea of being stranded somewhere and how we would react: this book addresses that idea and the difficulties that arise when one or more people rebel against individuals. On the surface this book may just seem like a story about kids not getting along, but in an allegorical and symbolic sense, there is something much deeper taking root which displays the darker side of human nature in individuals.<br /><br />I found that this book was more meaningful and enjoyable the second time I read it. I admittedly wasn't that much into it the first time, but the parts that we a bit unclear made more sense the next time I tried reading. If you can get past some of the British slang and keep pushing yourself, the book's second half is well worth it, especially Simon's experience with the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"rst of all, Golding examines the issue of what it would be like to have to survive in a situation where you are surrounded by peers, where laws are not part of the society.

It is a continuation of the story of Roland of Gilead and his three counterparts, who are along for a futuristic apocalyptic type of journey as they search in quest for the Dark Tower. Although I did not read the first three book of this series, I believe there is enough intro in the first one hundred pages of so to \\"catch\\" a reader up to speed with what happened in the previous book. This is probably why I tend to disagree with those who viewed this part of the book as \\"boring\\" or a \\"waste.\\" From there, we go into a flashback love story with Roland.<br /><br /> While Wizard and Glass might be praised as a great fantasy and western science fiction, there were some aspects of King's novel that I felt were less than appealing.  The deeply-rooted psychological angles that King explores in previous works, such as Carrie, Misery and The Shining are not present. Perhaps this is why the characters come off a little more one dimensional (one example could be Jonas), being quite cut and dry and less interesting than say Jack Torrance in The Shining.<br /><br />Still, King's capability to interweave characters and plot into such a unique and creative setting certainly merits praise. The first part of the book is a prologue and introduction into the series, and then there is about a 400 or so page flashback of Roland's love affair with Susan Delgado, and the subsequent trouble that arises for him and his group of men. Despite the length of the book, it is a page-turner and the action does flow relatively quickly. The last part of the book, the characters returning to the present and be presented with countless allusions to The Wizard of Oz, was quite exceptional.<br /><br />Although this book was not my cup of tea, I think any King fan would be impressed with it, and I certainly can give it kudos for trying to be different.	2005-04-14

For instance, there is approximately a 30 page description of the interior cathedral of Notre Dame and the surrounding areas. While this introduces us to some of the background of Paris' settings, it is a bit cumbersome to get through. Overall, however, Hugo's ability to bring characters-their faults, personalities, weaknesses, and human emotions-to life certainly makes this a great work of fiction.  <br /> <br />The main characters within the novel are Quasimodo, a deformed hunchback with only one eye: many of the people associate him with evil because of his deformities, yet he represents both good characteristics as well. Claude Frollo is the archbishop who looks over and cares for Quasimodo at the Norte Dame cathedral. Frollo is a tragic character mainly because of his fall from grace, from good to bad because of his own desires and his own resistance into temptation, he slowly fades and loses grip with humanity and goodness. Esmeralda is a gypsy dancer that captivates the attention of many of the people in the city, both for good and sinister reasons. She owns a goat, Dhali, and her and her pet become an issue to the people who view gypsies as being evil, especially because of her goat's ability to do \\"magic\\" tricks. Lastly, there is Phoebus, a man who Esmeralda becomes enchanted with after he saves her from peril. Although handsome, he is more materialistic and shallow.  <br /> <br /> For the most part the story was compelling, and the pace of the story really picks up towards the end of the novel. If you go into the novel expecting it to be like the films that have attempted to portray the story of Quasimodo, you may be surprised and/or disappointed. Hugo's knack is to write a novel with great emotion and to depict a true vision of human tendencies and behaviors, yet this novel is definitely somber in tone and many of the events in the book are different from the popular films. While some may question the coincidences within the novel's plot, this is a work that is magnified and becomes essentially bigger when you take all of its parts and put them together.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

Now, years later, I sat down and read it again, and had so much more of an appreciation for the book and the depth at which John Steinbeck was getting to in his portrayal of the Joads' trip to California in search of the American Dream.<br /><br />The story has both allegorical as well as literal elements to it. Set during the depression in the 1930s, it is the tale of the migrant farm workers from Oklahoma who leave the South for a chance at better job opportunities and life in the West. Specifically, we follow the path of the Joad family in their journey, and they use a rickety old truck that can barely fit the entire family to head westward. There are some from the community who refuse to go because of their principles, namely Grandpa Joad, who holds strongly to his belief that leaving Oklahoma is admitting defeat. Tom Joad, who recently got out of jail, and Jim Casy, a former preacher, join the family on their way west. Along the way, the Joads have several mishaps and disasters, and the family tries to stay together and maintain their hope that once they get there, everything will work out for the better.<br /><br />One of the more interesting characters in the novel is that of Jim Casy. He continually tells the family that he is no preacher when they want him to recite some type of prayer for them, yet, despite his protests, his role to the family and significance in the book is critical to their faith, as he represents a \\"moral\\" voice in the book. He is also responsible for the transformation of Tom Joad, the book's protagonist, who slowly begins to look at life from different viewpoints after meeting the preacher, and, by the end of the book, has changed his outlook.<br /><br />Among one of the great aspect of the novel is Steinbeck's descriptions of 1930s California. Some may think that this is tedious to read in a novel, as we have many chapters sole devoted to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written. In effect, it really paints a picture of what life was like for many who made the trip west, and their difficulties along the way.<br /><br />Not only is the novel a testament to the situation of the migrants in the 30s, but it depicts and indirectly criticizes man's inhumanity towards others in times of need. This is represented in the plight of the Joads, who represent a microcosm of a family in need during this time. These families get shuffled around from place to place, and try to keep their dignity and hopes up despite the lack of compassion from some of the landowners.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you have to read this in high school and don't like it, try it again a few years later down the line. There is also a movie version of this book, with Henry Fonda, from the 1940s, an excellent film that is quite faithful to the book.to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written.

It is a murder mystery, thriller, romance and a partial history. <br />  <br />Rebecca Lopez and her family are conversos, Jews who practice their religion secretly and help others escape persecution. She meets and becomes romantically involved with Will Shakespeare, a struggling playwright who is trying to put together the pieces of his best friend's murder. While Will longs to find the clues to discover Harry's killer, Rebecca longs for the excitement of being an independent person who can love the one she truly is attached to. Rebecca's father, who is Queen Elizabeth's physician,  leads a secret mission to help Jews escape out of Spain.  <br /> <br /> <br />While Faye Kellerman's novel is quite unique, intertwining historical and fictional elements, it came across as being a bit too trashy. There are many times Kellerman goes into great detail when describing something graphic or less than appealing (honestly, do we need a one page description about Queen Elizabeth's old wrinkled skin or health problems). The sex scenes are quite frequent and overdone throughout the novel, and there is a good deal of profanity (I didn't know they used the \\"f\\" word so often during Elizabethan times). Perhaps these sections of the novel could have been less blatant and repulsive, as they seemed to diminish much of the quality of the plot.  <br /> <br /> <br />While the novel irked me on certain levels, there were also aspects I found refreshing. Kellerman's ability to bring forth all of the Shakespearean and Elizabethan background, all the while telling a murder mystery, was remarkable and not an easy task to accomplish. She is able to take many aspects of Shakespeare's life and insert them into her character Will Shakespeare, making many of the connections accurate. As one reviewer noted, it reminded me a lot of how the movie \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" was done, adding fictional elements with historical elements based on Shakespeare's life.Much of the feel of the novel is Elizabethan, and the descriptions and background for the London area definitely give the novel its credibility.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is an entertaining read, based mostly on the plot and historical quality. However,  I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone.  <br /> <br />3 Stars.  <br />	2004-12-21

Eventually, through a bit of trickery, Helen is able to win over by accomplishing his list of &quot;demands&quot; in a letter that he sent.<br />Some of the questions that one may ask while reading this book: Why would Helen want to bother with trying to persuade Bertram to love her, since he is hardly worth it? Clearly, Helen, the heroine in this story, is a noble character, but often her judgment in the play is something to be questioned. Another question to be considered is what makes a couple compatible, especially those that seem to be mismatches? This is a comedy that thrives on a social mismatch between the classes. A more poignant fact is that Helen is a faithful person to her words, while Bertram has no redeeming quality that makes him worthy of her (Bertram hardly becomes a sympathetic character mainly because he never changes from the beginning to the end of the play).<br />Overall, it is a decent read. But I think that \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" is a better comedy, mainly because there is a stronger sense of character development in Petruchio and Kate.	2004-07-06

Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation\\" is a work with an endless amount of statistics, facts, opinions, interviews, commentary and issues that go far beyond the fast food technology-labor, health care, obesity, international relations, and poverty are among some of the many other concerns that surface. Perhaps it is best just to talk about what I felt were the weaknesses and then strengths of the book and go from there. <br />Weaknesses<BR>1) One weakness is the \\"anti-Republican\\" agenda that seems to be pushed by Schlosser. He argues in the books epilogue that he writes this book without any agenda to go after Republicans, yet he is constantly finding reasons why Republicans in the Senate are responsibly (directly or indirectly) for the problems in the slaughter houses, heath care for these workers, etc. <br />2) At times Schlosser seems to insinuate that we have no choice in our ultimate \\"doom\\" of eating fast food. He speaks as though we are mere naïve individuals who cannot distinguish what is wrong with fast food, that somehow McDonalds and other fast food establishments represent some Big Brother that brainwashes us into believing their ideologies of fast food. Given that America is the land of the free, and free thinkers, I hardly believe this to be true. <br />3) Schlosser tends to be overdramatic about this picture of fast food as an &quot;evil monster&quot; that is eating away (pun intended) our morals as humans and destroying our fabric of society. Fast food has its bad chinks in the armor, sure, but we cannot believe that all owners and leaders of fast food companies are immoral individuals, as there are plenty who are just trying to make a living and have worked their way up honestly. He seems to argue in a way that makes everything so \\"apocalyptic\\" and \\"doomsdayish,\\" and at times becomes too preachy. <BR> <BR>Strengths<BR>1) The stories of theslaughterhouses abuses and practices were very powerful and chilling, and they really drove home his point. It really puts into perspective where the beef we eat is coming from. We get into what exactly our Big Mac and extra large fries are made of, and how they get made, processed, packaged and sold to restaurants. <br />2) The laws that fast food companies break daily, such as overworking minors, underpaying employees, and having new employees use new, dangerous machinery are many effective arguments brought forth. For instance, he mention how the Fair Labor Standards Act is often abused and neglected when \\"kids\\" work fast food shifts. <br />3) Schlosser illustrates an interesting picture of how fast food has become popular and embraced by the general public in the past half century. He details the origins of KFC and McDonalds, for instance, and depicts how the fast food got on the map of America and continued its expansion at an alarming rate. He chooses Colorado Springs as his focal point, and this city represents a good location to select given its high population growth over the past two decades. <br />4) Perhaps the strongest evidence for his cause, Schlosser presents individual cases of workers and employees who have experienced some form of injustice. The poignant story of Kenny Dobbins, who worked at the Monfort slaughterhouse for 16 years only to get injured repeatedly, slighted, ignored and then finally fired from his company without receiving any medical benefits or pensions was shocking and repulsive, yet powerful in sending home his message of how big business sometimes has too much power over individuals. <br />5) Finally, the individual cases of food poisoning from bad or tainted meat are heart wrenching. The stories of children who died from the Jack in the Box \\"E. coli\\" meat contamination about 10 years ago make anyone concerned about the effects of eating fast food. <br />Although there is both good and bad points about this book, I think the overall effect was quite powerful. This is one work that I found hard to put down.  Like it or hate it, this is a significant book mainly because it brings to the forefront major issues and trends about our culture that should be pushed to the surface of conversation. <br />4 stars	2004-07-01
US	50458451	R1WWVMMANN3GDQ	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Drama combined with Mystery	Lehane's &quot;Mystic River&quot; is quite unique in that it is an intelligent thriller that knows how to build its characters and story. Unlike some of others who read the book, I couldn't readily identify Kate's killer, suspicion and mystery swaying back and forth throughout the novel as pieces began to be revealed (but then again, maybe I'm a bit dense).  While it was a decent book in terms of its characters, structure, and its basic themes, there was something about the ending that seemed rushed. At the same time, I felt like it was the second half of the story that gave it it's strength, mainly because the story's incongruities begin to come into focus and the complexity of the characters is revealed. While the book was strong at most points, the &quot;language&quot; got a little tiresome and seemed to diminish what was a complex and well-written drama and mystery.<br />The one thing I can say about Dennis Lehane is that he knows how to create characters. Unlike the characters in many &quot;bestsellers&quot;, these characters are not cardboard and have more than one dimension to them. He builds characters mainly through the thoughts and interactions of other, minor characters. We learn much about what kind of person Dave is from the thoughts and feelings of his wife, for example. The mere fact that she is uncertain exactly if he is guilty or not in the murder of Jimmy's daughter depicts the mysteriousness surrounding Dave and that decision he made long ago to get in the car.  Lehane also did a great job characterizing Jimmy Marcus. Jimmy comes across as a man who lives in both good and evil; he has a mental toughness to problems and conflict, but it can be rattled when his problems become too personal. The one aspect that unites all three of these one childhood friends is not only the incident with the abduction at the beginning of the novel, but that there is both good, evil and mystery in each of them. They each have a secret that remains untold to the others, and it's the time spent apart and the lack of communication with those around them that have created this uneven and confusing world.<br />The book did have its irritations that made me occasionally roll my eyes and sigh out loud. Some of the dialogue and situations were a bit hokey. Whitey, who seemed to be the stereotypical cop, got on my nerves mainly because his dialogue and intuition acted as a less-than-tolerable prototype to the mystery genre. His actions were typical and some of his lines were laughable. That and the aforementioned language issue, using the &quot;f&quot; word far too often, were the only notable issues I had with what I would otherwise call a &quot;page turner.&quot;<br />Overall, it is a book I would highly recommend. While it is a great suspense, it build most of its premise on being a drama with serious life issues, and, for this reason, its story can be best described as a &quot;bummer.&quot; Still, its redeeming value is that it is a complex and interesting mystery.s, and it's the time spent apart and the lack of communication with those around them that have created this uneven and confusing world. <br />The book did have its irritations that made me occasionally roll my eyes and sigh out loud.

US	50458451	R1QIGAV4GINVTY	0743253973	586746552	A Separate Peace	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Issues of Adolescence	A Separate Peace explores the issue of adolescence from the perspective of an all boy's school set in New England in the 1940s.<br />Gene, the protagonist, is friends with Phineaus, an outgoing and athletic guy. Although they are friends, there are differences that come between them, and this is what sets the story in motion. When the story begins, Gene is coming back to Devon, the school where a tragic accident happened that would forever change his life. We flashback to the story at hand, with Gene returning to the tree and place where everything changed.<br />Although Gene does admire Phineus (Finny), there is a certain amount of envy that he has. Gene, who is the intellectual type, wants to succeed in his studies and feels that Finny is out to \\"destroy\\" this. Finny is the type who does not have to be insecure about himself, and Gene sometimes misinterprets this.<br />One reviewer mentioned that this is a novel that uses stream of consciousness as a tool for its development, which I also agree with. This is not a novel with a lot of \\"action\\" per se, but its strength is particularly built from characterization of Gene and Finny's relationship at Devon. As the reader, we are only given Gene's perspective, and so we have to decide on our own how much truth there is to what Gene believes.<br />Many issues of adolescence are touched on. Jealousy, envy, conformity/ non-conformity and the issue of whether to participate and be part of the war are all felt by those who attend Devon, and Gene and Finny are at the core of this issue mainly because they are opposites with the exact same physical abilities up until Finny's accident. Knowles uses these tools to make a commentary on how a single perspective can change an adolescent's entire world, and then shows how an individual can use this to finally move on to adulthood by overcoming these.	2004-05-29
US	50458451	R2W1NJ1P135430	0064407314	610990578	Monster	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Search for Identity	Written as a screen play, Monster is a unique look at a youth's loss of innocence and the justice system all in one. Steve Harmon, the protagonist, is on trial for his part in the murder of a convenient store owner. Although he is involved in the case, the reader is not sure to what extent he was a part of the crime, as there are other suspects. <br />The other main suspect on trial is James King. Unlike Steve, King is lacking youth and innocence. Steve's active interest in filmography gives him the idea to tell this story as though it is a movie. As he goes through the court proceedings, we learn bits and pieces of the case as told through Steve's perspective. There are a series of flashbacks in which scenes from the events leading up to the crime are shown. <br />We get to hear the entire trial as it progresses, the opening statements, the evidence, the witnesses for both sides, and the closing arguments. Steve's search for identity while incarcerated is the constant theme of the book, and Myers does an excellent job taking us through a series of character point-of-views and scenes that are pivotal to the case through Steve's eyes. <br />Perhaps Steve Harmon's journey is such a difficult one because we get the sense that his lawyer has some doubt about his innocence. The significance of the title, Monster, is apparent in how people sometimes prejudge a person without knowing what they are really about. This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to read about the delimmas of court proceedings, and a minor's search for himself. This is a great book, especially for young adults.	2004-05-16

It does not use difficult vocabulary or attempt to give you an in-depth plot description, but what it does it synthesize a person's account of heaven into five chapters. A creative concept for a novel, it achieves its point mainly through its simplicity.  <br />What is the point? Well, the point revealed will be different for each individual. My perception of the novel, in it essence, is that the past effects our future and that we, in some odd or unique way, are all connected with those around us whether we realize it or not. Ultimately, all events and people have an essential role in our lives, and that there is something better out there for us if we can address our issues in life.  <br />Eddie, the book's protagonist, is a maintenance worker for an amusement park and gets into an accident that claims his life. He can't remember all the details of his last moments, but we follow Eddie into heaven where he, one by one, encounters five people from his past. These people were not necessarily the closest ones to him in life, but they all played a significant role in his being here. Within each of these people there is a message revealed that Eddie uncovers, a lesson about life and the relationships that he had in life. There is a progression from the first to the fifth person, and Eddie becomes closer to Heaven as he understands more and more with each story. <br />The difficult aspect of such a book is in expressing a message or lesson without becoming a lecture. Albom teeters on this edge, but I think he does a commendable job in keeping the situations and people involved in Eddie's life the focal point of the novel, as well as the descriptions and sensations that Eddie feels on his journey to Heaven. He tells the story, and lets the reader decide. For this reason some will like it, and others will want to put it down after a few pages. Personally, I thought it was a uniquely inspiring story and would recommend it to anyone.	2004-04-07

The good aspect of this is that it is quite easy to find your spot and, then pick up where you left off, if you happen to stop reading in the middle of a chapter. The negative aspect of short tracks is that it is difficult to skip around to particular chapters without \\"guessing\\" where a chapter might end (because there is no insert to tell which chapters are contained in each disc).<br />Overall, Dick Hill does a superb job of reading in this unabridged version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Hill's voice personifies Huck's narrative, and he keeps the Southern flavor of Twain's novel intact. What makes this reading particularly great is that Hill has a great ability to not only take on Huck, but other characters as well. Hill changes his voice for other characters such as Tom Sawyer, Jim, the Duke and the king, Pap and others.  For this reason, this CD is a great tool for the reluctant readers in classes, and serves as a great supplement for the study of this novel.<br />I have found that buying audios to classic to be a gamble because you never really know what you are getting, but this is one of the best I've gotten.	2004-03-09

Leroux's story is a scattering of many different types fit together in a novel: it has romance, horror, suspense, mystery and is (loosely) historically based on events which took place at Paris' Majestic Opera House. The book is historically based on a tragic and mysterious death of an opera singer at Paris' Majestic Opera House. Leroux did some research in preparing to write this novel, and some tidbits of background into this event are in the book's introduction. <br />The novel's story has three central characters-Christine Daae, the beautiful opera singer, the Vicomte de Chagny (Raoul), who is in love with Christine from her childhood, and lastly, the Phantom (Erik), who is horribly disfigured and obsessed with music and Christine. <br />Reminiscent of a murder mystery, the novel's story is centered on the mystery of an Opera ghost that has caused havoc in one of the popular Paris Opera houses. After several murders, the Opera Ghost has ordered demands from the co-managers of the Opera House in the form of a letter, which many take to be a joke. However, after several more bizarre incidents, including an incident in which the chandelier falls on a guest during a show, many of those involved in the business of the house begin to suspect that something must be behind this. Eventually Erik, the Opera Ghost, becomes obsessed with Christine and imprisons her in many ways. <br />Leroux's writing is refreshing. It reminded me a bit of a work written in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes mysteries, yet there is a definite supernatural elements included to give it a dark, mysterious feel as well. Leroux is able to lay out the story, make the characters well rounded and believable, and then intertwine all the unusual events in a neat conclusion. This is a well written and, for the most part, overlooked work. Fortunately, eventually someone decided to make a movie about this book in the 1920s, and since that time, the book has been give at least a little of the recognition that it deserves. <br />Recommended also: The Hound of the Baskervilles	2004-01-01
US	50458451	R22YXWDULFYOP2	0553272535	88900905	Night	Books	5	1	2	N	N	One of the most powerful books I have ever read	Elie Wiesel's narrative is similar to The Diary of Anne Frank, as it takes you into the world of the Nazi prison camps that consumed Germany during the early 1940s. Wiesel's illustrates the tragedy that the prison had on him as a youth in just the first day:<br />\\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed.\\"<br />Wiesel's novel, which is pretty much an autobiography, captures the brutality and horrors of the Holocaust in a Nazi death camp. I found that Night was one of those books very tough to put down because it is a powerful read and the descriptions were brutally honest. It was gripping, and you feel the pain that the narrator feels as he and his father try to maintain hope while trying to survive the trials of a concentration camp when he is constantly being surrounded by death.<br />This was one of those books that made me think deeply about the situation of the Holocaust, the tragedy it caused and how those who suffered should never be forgotten. The narrator's main struggle is not only a physical struggle to survive, but also a psychological and spiritual one as well. He wavers in his faith in God because of the realities of horror he experiences and sees, but he uses his faith to also make it through each day. That, and the thought of staying with his father, keeps him going despite hunger and emotional and physical abuse: \\"I had no right to let myself die. What would he do without me? I was his only support.\\"<br />One reviewer, Gary, made a comment about this book's style being irrelevant to critique because of the deeply troubling and significant subject matter of the book. I agree wholeheartedly.<br />Night is a book that people should be exposed to because it paints a perspective on history that stays with the reader.<br />Also recommended: The Diary of Anne Frank	2003-12-28

For one, the writing was so superfluous in description that it became a slight annoyance to me. Boyle doesn't just tell you a point and be done with it; you literally have it shoved in your face time and time again. He spends page after page just getting to a minute point. There is an overabundance of similes and metaphors, and the writing comes across as \\"showy\\" occasionally.  In addition, there were many unlikely coincidences inserted into the plot, such as the two families coming in contact with each other repeatedly that made the climactic finish a bit predictable.<br /> The most irritating part was usage of profanity and vulgarity for seemingly unnecessary purposes and at the most unusual times. Reading particular parts that contained profane and crude descriptions made me wonder mainly because it absolutely served no purpose. Not only that, but it doubtlessly made much of the descriptions incongruous alongside the poetic and illustrative adjectives used in the same sentences. I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue and explanations. This could have been easily edited, and it would have made for stronger illustration of a scene or idea. <br />Despite the irritations, The Tortilla Curtain gains most of its strength from its distinctive message about the confrontation of two vastly different cultures.<BR> <BR>This book underscores the whole illegal immigration issue by pitting together a liberal Southern Californian family with an immigrant couple who have to try to scrape by for their basic necessities. The readers get to see the harsh realities from the point of view of Candido and America, a couple who come to California for a taste of a better life. Facing the reality of living like \\"animals\\", their story sets the tone for a deep message about a current problem we face. If one steps back and views this book from a point of symbolism, keeping in mind the essentialtheme, it serves as an allegory and commentary on injustices faced by many cultures in today's America.	2003-12-20

Among the authors included are Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, William Faulkner, D. H. Lawrence, and Shirley Jackson. <br />One of my favorites in the book was &quot;The Lottery&quot;, by Shirley Jackson. Jackson has a great knack for bringing out the bizarre when a small town gets together annually to hold a lottery. Each citizen gets to draw a slip of paper. However, there is a twist to this lottery. <br />Another great story was &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; by Poe. Poe is able to bring forth the truly dark and gothic style in his writing. This story tells of a man who is obsessed and enraged by an old man's eye. This tale examines the inner mind of an &quot;unreliable&quot; narrator, so we percieve the true story based on what he has told us. <br />Other notable stories include Hemingway's &quot;A Clean, Well-lighted Place&quot;, Faulkner's &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot;, and part of Kafka's novel &quot;Metamorphosis.&quot;<br />This book is great for leisurely type reading and also serves as a sampling from some of the more prominent recent literary figures. Recommended for those who enjoy the modern writer. Because it is a paperback it is resourceful and easy to carry around.	2003-12-10

But, it hardly deserves the accolades and the attention it is getting. Controversial? Yes.<br />A masterfully crafted work of art? No. There are many \\"movie\\" type action sequences and convenient escapes by our protagonists; it becomes a bit cliched to the reader after a certain point.<br /> This, for the most part, was a slow read that was tough to get through because of its lack of depth. The only deep part of the book is the seemingly endless \\"facts\\" that are discussed about Da Vinci, the church, the Holy Grail and this  amazing code that has seemingly no end to it. The characters are constantly trying to solve the code, but the process of bringing these facts to play is absurd.  And these \\"facts\\" are really not real facts (only facts for the sake of the book).<br />Much of the dialogue, combined with stereotyped good guy/ bad guy situations,  make for a mediocre story. The protagonists manage to just get by the bumbling police, who manage to blow several key opportunities to get them. It would not have been surprising to hear the police captain scream \\"Don't blow this case\\" to a lowly, but eager rookie officer who wanted in on the chance to nab our heroes.  The characters are either evil and corrupt, or good and benevolent; it is as simple as black and white.<br />If there is an aspect that should be applauded it is Brown's ability to take many aspects of history (as factious as they are) and attempt to intertwine them into the plot of a story.  But, these attempts fail because they beg too many convenient coincidences, and the authenticity of the characters is seriously lacking as a result.<br />This book will probably end up being some major motion picture in a few years, with big stars and a big budget.<br />As far as being a unique work of fiction, this fails.ig stars and a big budget. <br />As far as being a unique work of fiction, this fails.	2003-11-27

Although this is not an in-depth summarization of all Shakespeare's works, The Everything Shakespeare Book gives the reader the gist of sonnets, background, and individual play summaries. For the price, this is beneficial resource for anyone who wants a little information about Shakespeare and the Elizabethan periods. For instance, there is a discussion on the significance of the sonnets and speculation about whom they were written for. There are also some generalities about travel, costumes, entertainment, theatre opposition and rivals of Shakespeare during this time period. <br />There are a few problems with the book.<BR>Some of the details are a bit vague and some of the \\"essentials\\" are relatively unessential (Rubie should have called this section \\"tidbits\\" instead).  There is a section on Shakespearean words and their present day definitions (aye means \\"yes\\", etc), but it would have been more effective to include tougher Shakespeare words. <br />The most significant part is the play summaries and character lists (from these plays).  Although this section is not complete in thoroughly characterizing any one play, they are certainly useful for a reader just wanting a quick summary of the work. After each play description, there is a quick caption that discusses elements such as where and when the play was first performed and how it ranks among other plays, as well as a brief commentary about the play. Finally, the section finishes with a list of popular quotes within each drama. <br />Overall, this is recommended for anyone wanting to brush up on a little Shakespeare or wanting some insight into this time period.	2003-07-31

He becomes one with Nature, meeting a family of bears in the area,  and renames himself \\"Bear's Brother\\" because he feels a closeness to one of the bears in the family. Eventually he is taken to the white man's world and put through a school, but finds school tiresome and boring. After trying to return to his place, he is once again found and brought back. Consequently, he begins to live in a world that he does not want to adopt, and forms a bitterness that carries into his adulthood. <br />At the very core of this novel is the effort to return to one's origin. Tom Black Bull takes on several names (Bear's Brother, Devil Tom Black), and this signifies his lack of identity. He ultimately finds his identity only through the trials of controlling people and an abusive world. He takes his anger out when he becomes a bronco rider, attempting to abolish his memories with rebellious riding and attitude toward people. <br />This book has a simple narrative, but the message is certainly deeper than it looks. The euphoric revelation for the individual is finding out who he is and what is significant in life's journey. This is what Tom must discover through the many setbacks.

US	50458451	RHDPHLKEM917A	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Timeless novel about life's lessons	To Kill A Mockingbird makes its mark mostly through illustrating small southern life in Alabama and exposing the reader to the prejudices that pervade not only the 1930s but the times we live in.  The story is told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch (also known as Scout), and, as a child of only eight, she shares (in looking back) her ideas of family life and the rich history of Maycomb. <br />Harper Lees depiction of 1930s South racial prejudice is a powerful one. Atticus Finch is clearly the hero of the novel,  defending a black man on trial for raping a white woman.  A widowed father, he teaches Jem (his son) and Scout lessons in life, one of the most paramount being to walk in anothers shoes to understand life from their viewpoint. Jem and Scout take many of these lessons in stride and try to impress upon themselves being civilized and respectful all of society. <br />Another aspect of the novel is the mystery surrounding Boo Radley and his spooky house.  Boo Radley represents all the bad rumors of the Maycomb community, and yet, most of these are unjustifiable. Scout, Jem and their friend Dill are obsessed with discovering exactly who Boo is. <br />Although the novel is primarily small town in nature, the themes encompass everything we deal with today as a society, namely discrimination and prejudice. Through the trial of Tom Robinson, we see Atticus worthy of great respect for standing up to the ideas of a narrowed-minded community. The Finch family also must deal with the man whose daughter is the alleged victim in the case, Bob Ewell. (Bob Ewell represents the ignorance of a small town). <br />Perhaps what makes the book timeless is not only its theme in the general sense, but the final speech by Atticus during the closing arguments. This oration is built up over a long trial, and it is worthy of the time it takes to get there. (Although, I think Gregory Peck made this scene come to life more in the movie). <br />A reader may frown atthe many tidbits of detail given to establishing the Southern way of life, especially in the initial chapters, but the book progresses to a point where the reader wants to know the fate of Tom Robinson, Atticus and the rest of the Finches. This book is a classic because it delves into modern topics, a central issues that certainly we all must come to terms with: discrimination and lack of equality.	2003-07-24
US	50458451	R2UJSZ4RQOANZK	1576906264	299717534	A Guide for Using To Kill a Mockingbird in the Classroom (Literature Unit (Teacher Created Materials))	Books	4	37	38	N	Y	Excellent Resource Guide for the Price	I thought that this guide was definitely worth the money that was paid for it. The teacher created materials guide for To Kill a Mockingbird includes a table of contents which divides the novel into 6 different sections (for example, Section 1 includes Chapters 1 through 5 in the book). There are  pre-reading activities to generate interest in the book (themes such as justice and prejudice, as well as a brief biography of Harper Lee) as well as a few ideas for teachers after the novel is finished (there is a list of research topics for this time period that is helpful for teachers who want to generate some related topics). <br />Vocabulary lists for each of the novel sections and a few vocabulary activity ideas are also included (examples: part of speech chart for vocabulary words, word puzzles, etc). I found this section extremely beneficial because it saves so much time to already have a list of difficult words generated for the students. <br />Each section has study questions for each of the 6 sections (it is actually listed as the Quiz section). Although some of the questions are a bit general (example, List three important events from this section), overall the questions fit quite well within the scope of the novel and can be used as a tool for checking comprehension. <br />There are several other neat ideas that can be used directly or adapted by the teacher into another activity. For instance, there is a section on Urban Myths and Myths, which ties into the character of Boo Radley. There are questions for conducting an interview of \\"The Great Depression\\" that could be used as a take-home assignment for a student. There are ideas for Southern Cooking (if that's your thing) and a section on understanding similes and metaphors (which are quite frequent in the book). Also, there is a characterization chart for four of the main characters (Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill) as well as a section that discusses the ideas of theme and examples of racial hatred and discrimination. <br />Overall, although only 48 pages in length, I felt this was an excellent buy. It is very organized and quite helpful for a teacher needing extra resource material for a novel.	2003-07-21

He is an African tribe man who is hard-hearted and stern towards his family because he wants to become something great in life (although some may view him as a chavanist). The tribe's rituals are followed with grave tradition, and Okonkwo seeks for ways to better his personal status (although not a literal translation, one's fate is referred to as \\"chi\\", meaning \\"personal God.\\")<br />The story is divided into 3 major sections. The first section deals with mainly Okonkwo's family and tribal background; we get a first hand look at their beliefs in marriage and status of tribal leaders. The 2nd part shifts into Okonkwo's removal from his village, and his eventual progression back into his society. Finally, the most compelling part of the tale, the third section  highlights Okonkwo's orientation back into his village as well as  his and other tribes' encounters with the new community which has brought Christianity into the region; subsequently, there is a clash of power between African religion and culture and the Christian believers. <br />Several points may make this book less than appealing. <BR>One of the more exasperating aspects of reading this type of novel is getting acclimated to the Ibo vocabulary and expressions (although in this version, there is a glossary included in the back index). There are relatively trite topics included, such as a chapter on the process of harvesting yams, but my belief is that these chapters are mainly to get the reader accustomed to the values and background of African tribal life. It is necessary to read this book with a certain degree of respect for different cultures and the rituals they share. <br />Although it moved a little too slow at the beginning, the  eventual story of Okonkwo's rise and fall becomes more intriguing as the reader moves on. Not only is Achebe's novel a commentary on the ills of clashing religions and cultures, but the reverence placed on position and status in individual tribal communities. This is an excellent read for those who want to get a sense of tribal life or religion in African cultures. For those who just want a leisurely read, it may take some patience getting into this novel.	2003-07-04
US	50458451	R3NIYOEL5JRIJ3	0671039164	29336337	Antony and Cleopatra (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Mediocre work from The Bard	Of Shakespeare's plays, this seems to be one that delves very little into the motivations of characters. The three main characters (Caesar, Antony, and Cleopatra) seemingly just &quot;ask&quot; around about the others rather than taking any action. Antony's anger against Caesar, when he finally does take action and go against him in war, does not seem that justified because we aren't given much in the way of grounds for his anger.<br /><br />Maybe my opinion is a little biased because I didn't prefer the plot of this play over the likes of such plays as &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, or &quot;King Lear&quot;,  but I just felt as though Antony was more an unlikable individual than a tragic hero. He cheats on two wives, and, as a reader, it is hard to ever feel sorry for him.  Cleopatra's character is one-dimensional also; she seems to just lay around and ponder what life is about and ask around about Antony to her many servants.<br /><br />Of all the characters, I think that Enobarbus (also called Domitius) was the most compelling, because he narrates to the audience (via asides and discussions with minor characters) insight into the state of Antony's downfall. Through him much of the psychology of Antony is divulged. An instance of this is when he sucessfully predicts that Antony will not keep his faithfullness to his second wife.<br />Although I think this is lesser of the Shakespeare works, I certainly felt it is still a 3 simply because Shakespeare has a way of painting a picture elloquently of how society works. This play illustrates the underlying themes of politics, revenge and adultery, all issues that prevade our world today. So, in many respects, although this was written in the 1500s, it is still a piece of literature that contains modern problems.	2003-06-23
US	50458451	R2I23YLHOSVSN4	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Blinded by Ambition, Gatsby a Tragic Figure	Jay Gatsby is a tragic figure blinded by his own ambitions to rekindle romance with Daisy, a woman from his past. The story is told through the eyes of Nick Carroway, who sees from all perspectives the world of the rich: the hollowness of the Buchanons, the &quot;mask&quot; that Gatsby must wear to attain his goals, the many &quot;acquaintences&quot; of the Gatsby parties who only attend his parties because it serves their own purpose of having a good time.<br />At the heart core of this tale is the question of how far one must go to follow the aquistion of a dream, whether realistic or not. Nick admires Gatsby's determination, but he sees the dangers of Gatsby continuing to follow his dream. However, what Nick learns from Gatsby is the most essential part of the book.<br />This is one of those books that starts off relatively slow, but picks up as we move on. It is set in the mid 1920s and has a few flashback references to Gatsby's former affair with Daisy. Overall I would recommend reading this book if you have never done so. I will admit that I was assigned this book in high school, but never even finished it. When I reread it a few years later, I was pleasantly surprised. I think what you should take from a book like The Great Gatsby is what it says about not only life in the 1920s, but the times we live in now.	2003-06-22
US	50458451	RMUHU1WLZOAS1	067172262X	43217624	Hamlet	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Hamlet : Folger Library edition	Hamlet is, by far, the most complex of Shakespeare's many plays. Many of the themes covered are love vs hate, action vs non-action, revenge, and jealousy. Hamlet discovers that \\"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" when he encounters the ghost of his father, the King, who has recently been killed in battle. From here, Hamlet goes on a search for the discovery of what happened to his father. However, Hamlet not only uncovers secrets of the past, but also the depths of his own being. <br />The Folger Edition of Hamlet is a great edition to buy, especially for those who are studying this play in high school or college, because it is relatively cheap in price and is very \\"reader-friendly\\" with side notes and footnotes that accompany each page of each scene. So, even if you aren't a Shakespeare lover or if Shakespeare is just a little intimidating (we all know how this feels), this version at least allows you to get the gist of what is going on. Also, there are summaries of each scene within each act, to let you know in layman's terms what is taking place. I highly recommend this edition.	2003-06-22
US	50458451	R1YQTD8SE0E6FI	0140386645	374123609	The Westing Game	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Great "Who Done It?" Murder Puzzle	A fun book all around. It is a murder mystery with a twist. There are really 2 mysteries: who killed Sam Westing and what is the hidden message from the list of clues. Sam Westing's will calls together 8 pairs of heirs who must solve the mystery of Westing's death. As expected, many of the individuals are paired with someone they do not like or identify with. <br />One of the difficult aspects of this novel is keeping track of the 16 major characters who are working together. There are 3 or  4 major families, and a few scattered individuals.  However, it is great how Raskin is able to intertwine all the complexities of each character and still keep the plot moving rather quickly. We learn, as the story progresses, the events of the past that individuals are trying to keep secret for various motives. With each secret revealed, the Westing Game gets closer to being solved.   <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone, but especially for the young adult. This is one of the rare books that allows you, as a reader, to also try to solve the mystery with the characters. And remember,  \\"it's not what you know, but what you don't know, that counts.\\"	2003-06-22

I hear many of you say that much of her other stuff is much better, so perhaps I will take a chance and read her other mysteries. <BR>As for \\"Traitor to Memory\\" I just felt it should have packed a bigger punch, particularly at the end, for a book well exceeding 1000 pages. After reading, I honestly had to go back and make sure that really was the ending. <BR>Another annoyance, at least for me, was the unnecessary trashy lesbian and love scenes. (Spare me this, there are many other trashy novels in the romance section at Barnes and Nobles).These appeared to be put in just for the sake of putting them in; who knows, maybe part of this book was suppose to be a soap opera.It did little for the characterization and could have been deleted from the book.This book could have been edited further and been written effectively in say 600 or so pages. <BR>Still, I did enjoy reading much of this book. You probably wouldn't figure that, since I'm giving it 2 stars. There was a great deal of intrigue and, unlike many others, I did like the journal entries that got us into the mind of Gideon. I just suggest that if you buy this book, that you will have to have some patience in getting through it. Although I felt it read rather quickly, getting through 1000 or more pages will take some time, especially with some of the \\"nonsense\\" included within the book.	2003-06-10
US	50458451	R3IXCAP15ABMQ1	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Simple, but not too bad. Nothing phony at all.	I can see why people wouldn't like this book and all. Really. I can. But, me, on the other hand, liked this book and all. It was a riot. A real riot....<br />People may not like this book because it obviously has very simple language at points and, as a reader, we are never given the point-of-view of other characters. However, I felt the simplicity of the novel gives it it's effect. Holden takes the world as being simple, yet there are many complex issues he must deal with.He is searching for his identity and the reason that most people are &quot;phonies&quot; is because he still hasn't completely figured out the world. Personally I felt as though the book couldn't have been written from any other point of view than 1st person and still achieved it's effect. I read the book rather quickly because it is as if someone is sitting there telling you their life story...well, in a way, Holden is. I recommend this book to anyone because it is original and definitely not boring. It is a book that many relate to, because it deals with the teenage world that we've all been a part of. <br />I still don't think this book is anything better than 3 stars because it is rather simplistic in nature. However, I can understand why people consider it a classic.	2003-06-10
US	50458451	R123OKDUMH2V4W	0316569321	613460974	White Oleander	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Mixed emotions	Well, I will say that I do feel a great deal of mixed emotions after reading this novel. You may be a bit tired of similes and metaphors after reading the book, but let me add one more: reading this book is a painful shot in the arm that you can't wait to be over and done with. You feel a little relief and realize that it was necessary, but, my gosh, did it have to be so painful.<BR> The book is sad and dreary, but I did find Astrid to be an intriguing character that one could actually \\"pull\\" for while reading. (Although, we already know that nothing good is going to come. Astrid always forewarns us of upcoming danger each time it is about to happen). Her self-discovery through the various foster homes in Los Angeles and the picture she paints with each episode is a life lesson. But, like others who have reviewed have noted, this does seem to be a stereotyped portrayel of ruthless and mean-spirited foster parents who always betray Astrid either physically, emotionally or psychologically. (Are foster homes really that bad?) <BR>I felt a lack of compassion for Ingrid. Ingrid was quite annoying, with her \\"I'm better than the world\\" attitude about everything, her artistic and poetic expressions to justify murder and self-centeredness. I wished Astrid would have just told her to \\"shut up\\" and walked out of her life, but it never happened.<BR>I realize there is a lesson to be learned, and I know the book's main focus is self-discovery and survival, but it was quite a long journey. And a sad one.	2003-06-08
US	50458451	RB0LFTQ90Q8FP	0140445277	569503661	The Brothers Karamazov (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Complex novel that examines human themes	Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov is one of the best novels I've ever read. I had to read this book for one of my literature classes in college, and first looked at the 900 odd pages with disdain like many who were \\"required\\" to read something would. Although this is not a novel that one immediately gets into, the depth of the novel becomes a gripping event to witness.<br />The detail of the four brothers and the Karamazov family is well constructed and outlined in the beginning chapters. As we move on, what makes the novel a great work is the mystery that we must uncover about the death of Fyodor Karamazov and what roles the 4 brothers played in it. Also, the debate over good and evil is constantly addressed through Aloysha, the \\"good\\" son,  (one of the Karamazov brothers and probably considered the main character)in his questions to his brother and his asking for advice from the elders and priests. What makes the work impressive is that although the four brothers are different in personality, there is a parallel between them in that they must deal with their father's \\"foolishness\\" and are all involved in the his death.<br />This novel, although long in duration, is quite impressive in expressing many outlets and themes. Good vs evil, family relationships, conflicts between life and death, murder, and faith to others are among some of the major subjects in this novel. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book that deals with the aspect of the human experience and what we all endure spiritually-- conflicts of life.	2002-07-17

The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way. <BR>This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read. <BR>The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed. <BR>I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations.	2002-07-15

It is written in the tradition of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, with a young Will Tweedy narrating his adventures and family life. I love the humor within this book, as Will Tweedy is always looking towards his grandpa for advice and how to live. He experiences many of the hardships, both sorrow and loss of love ones, in finding himself. <BR>This book does have elements of racism and deals with the death of family members. I think that Burns was making a statement about how people felt about levels of society in the South and how this is an unnecessary and unjustified way to think. Much of this novel is about finding oneself in youth, and understanding how and why family must stick together. It has a good balance of both humor and sadness.	2002-07-15
US	50458451	R179NZS5WRDWH3	0684801221	737092002	The Old Man and The Sea	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Not the best of Hemingway's novels, but still a good book	I am giving this book a 3 stars, but I consider this on the more \\"positive\\" side of the 3 then the negative. I believe that \\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" is not one of Hemingway's best works, however there are many aspects of this novel and themes covered that make this a significant novel. I teach this novel and find many students complaining about the lack of action. This book's main point, or moral, is the theme of struggling against the obstacles in life. What many do not realize is that much of the book is symbolic, with characters (Santiago, Manolin, the fish) representing allegorical figures of society. It might help to first look online for some reviews of this novel before plunging into the book if you are unsure about giving this novel a try. As usual, Hemingway uses simple structure in his narration. However, the book's structure is like this for a reason, and there are variable changes in structure and point of view as you read. The bottom line is that a reader might want to know a little about the symbolism and themes presented before beginning reading this novel.	2002-07-03
US	50458451	R1J8VHE2WSY61V	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A worthy novel	What I liked about A Farewell to Arms is that Hemingway, as so often in his writing, is able to bring characters alive through the use of varied sentence structure and dialogue. There are some periods of the novel where it tends to drag; however, most of the plot and descriptions are enough to get over the &quot;slow&quot; periods of the novel. Hemingway, as he often does in his novels, explores the theme of masculinity through the actions of the male characters, most specifically Lt. Henry.<br />I found that what makes this novel a classic is the richness of Hemingway's characterization: how well his characters are developed. The reality of war is brought to life in Hemingway's words, and we see Henry's struggle to maintain a positive outlook on life and love while the horror of war is displayed.<br />I felt this was a good novel for someone with an appreciation for Hemingway's novels; others may choose to begin by reading one of Hemingway's short stories before working up to this novel. At any rate, I hope you enjoy it.	2002-06-18
