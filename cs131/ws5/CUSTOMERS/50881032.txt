I bought this book because I grew up in Brooklyn and thought the author did a terrific job of getting the locale and the residents down right. However, the writing was laborious to me, all the different/relationships. It ook forever to get \\"into\\" the action, even if you knew what was coming. I was so tired in Part I that I skipped Pt. 2 and moved right into Pts. 3&4 ands never missed the plot. I think the ending was interesting, although convoluted. Pepper seems to be overreaching is putting out her story. Maybe she should stay in Cobble Hill and just write a period piece or a morality fable about the yuppies. Stright out that would work on its own.	2005-06-27

Now, how about following up on Bucks County - Bubbles never got to the Blass Bass Inn as Stiletto promised in Bubbles Abroad. I've never seen another good, funny novel from Eastern PA.

As a health care professional, I am also interested in reasonble critiques of the health care system. I agree with O'Brien that the complexity of the system revolves around economic issues as well. However, it is with premises that I disagree. Many (most?) physicians do not study to practice medicine primarily to \\"make money\\" or with solely financial goals. I say that because, if financial goals predominate, one goes to business school and gets an MBA, becomes a stockbroker, etc. It is quicker, cheaper (and probably easier) to get an MBA than an MD. (I personally have studied in both fields.)I do actually think that many good, honest physicians are to a large extent motivated by \\"helping people\\", science/technology, even just by social status. Honestly, this is true of many physicians I know. I believe that, once economists took a look at the health care field (broader than the \\"medical field\\"), they imposed a financial lens which they believe motivated (some? many?) physicians to seek the \\"lucrative\\" area of medicine.  <br /> <br />The issue is the financing of health care, not the technicalities of health care itself. It is a \\"straw man\\" discussion to argue that physicians caused the economic problems (and therefore \\"they must be controlled\\"). Yes, some physicians caused problems (especially the entrepenuerially interested physicians, more closely allied to the business mentality themselves). But this self-serving argument, and the system itself has genuinely alienated the (many) decent physicians who really want to do well for their patients. Sure, physicians want to make \\"a good income\\", largely because of the time and expense of a medical education; but it is too narrow to think that is the sole (or even predominant) motive.  <br /> <br />I would like to agree more with O'Brien as the author, but I also believe he presents a one-sided argument. The situation of health care (as a right? a social service? a commodity?)is an economic (political) policy question, not a question of \\"blaming\\" physicians and their cultural system.	2005-01-17

Almost a Lucy Ricardo type. I've read all her books and totally enjoy them and the quirky corner of Pennsylvania, where the stories are located. <br /> <br />However, this one, \\"Ablaze\\" never set off the fire for me. First of all, this part of Pennsylvania is rather depressing - and economically depressed - (I've visited there) so its a little hard to make light of. I read half the book and put it aside for a few months before I could get into it again. But now I am totally confused with so many characters, subplots - like is Strohmeyer and/or Bubbles in a manic state or something? I felt the writing was just rushing one from one detail to another character to whatever was next. A little Lithium here, please!! Still, I love Bubbles and will stick with her no matter what, though I wish she's get out of Slagville. How about a little visit south to Bucks County for some relief?	2004-11-24

I really enjoyed Desert Heat - the Southwest location, the rodeo setting, the \\"intellectual\\" addition of Patience's PhD dissertation, the mini-mysteries of Tyler, Charlie and Lucky and, of course the total sexiness of Dallas. HOWEVER the ending was abominable....the heroine who works so hard to get her PhD gives up her career immediately to be with her lover - and - what is WORSE Kat Martin provides an alternate ending (of Dallas switching his career to become a vet and stay with PJ in Boston) which is rejected!!!!! How retro can you be???? It really ruined the book for me and turned it into such a cliche in the last few pages, which was unnecessary!!! Does Kat Martins \\"audience\\" require this self-effacing behavior? I myself have a PhD (and I love good romance novels) and I was totally turned on to Dallas BUT I would never just give my work up like that. In fact I'd find it sexy that a man like Dallas would offer himself to me so that we both could prosper! So sad. Yes, I am \\"losing Patience.\\"	2004-11-17

As a psychologist with 20+ years experience, I am less than enamored with Peter Levine's work, and here's why:  <br /> I realize lately that through many &quot;brief therapy&quot; approaches, both therapists and clients are looking for quick answers to rather complex problems. Those of us who have traditionally done longer term therapy already knew that it wasn't so easy. We also knew - or at least should know if we want to offer hope - that humans have an innate drive toward health, in spite of &quot;trauma.&quot; When Levine points out the complexity of trauma, even as an em-bodied experience, he takes a &quot;radical&quot; approach - but really nothing new. Now many therapists and clients are &quot;discovering&quot; the baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. I give Levine credit for re-opening our eyes, but, frankly, this in not new material. Real growth producing therapy is a broad endeavor, not a six session &quot;technique&quot;....	2004-07-28

I picked up the book because the topics of archeology, Maryland and Robert's popularity were intriguing. After 50 pages, I just speed-read the book to get the plot (mostly about an adoption/kidnapping, which was not what I expected). I found I could skip page upon page and still get the story (which maybe could be witten in 10 or 15 pages). I know Roberts is popular, but this book was like a worn-out, unnecessary, mediocre, lukewarm &quot;romance&quot; with potenitally semi-serious plot (archeology, land disputes, legal-medical issues around adoption) which drown amidst the &quot;need&quot; for romance. Also Roberts tries to sound too &quot;hip&quot; citing rock groups, etc. I felt like this book was really pandering to the readers. So, guess what, I don't recommend it!	2004-05-01

As a psychologist in NYC (born in Brooklyn!!) I have worked with this issue over and over again. NY attracts the bright and ambitious, but many have moved here from bluer collars in New England, the South, the Midwest, in search of career advancement. I have seen them in therapy, when somehow a depression sets in during the midst of a &quot;successful&quot; career. Lubrano deserves praise for bringing this issue &quot;out of the closet&quot; and shows respect for the struggles of the bright achiever, doing it mostly on their own. I wonder why so many of the (upper) &quot;middle class&quot; have more contempt than admiration for this achievement<BR>Some Problems: In comparing blue/white collar, Lubrano jumps from &quot;middle class/white collar&quot; to &quot;upper-middle/upper class&quot; too often. Although he makes a good distinction between &quot;blue-collar&quot; and &quot;others&quot;, many &quot;white -collars (middle-middle)&quot; are nowhere as priviledged as he claims. Ivy League to me is &quot;upper-middle&quot;, most sons of major CEO's, governors of states, etc. are &quot;upper&quot;. While I totally agree with Lubrano's concepts, he often jumps a step (or 2 or 3) between his roots and the classes he describes. Also, I think the analysis could be a bit sharper, and the book a bit better organized, less repetitious.<BR>Nevertheless, Thank You!!!	2004-02-25

I have to admit, this book does have a good premise and some good practical exercises - <br />however - I could hardly relate to Ms. Carpenter and her assorted group of colleagues, all of whom seem rather &quot;priviliged&quot; in their varied media/outdoors/CEO status. You could hardly imagine these case studies really &quot;suffered&quot; with career problems; they all seemed rather &quot;connected&quot; (power brokered), monied and probably from families that eased the way for them to start off. The Chapters book was rather self-serving of Carpenter, who &quot;discovered&quot; a new career of writing/coaching (albiet with a ghost writer/collaborator). I was soooooo turned off by this book (like &quot;oh, my my maid just quit, how bad can it get??&quot;). I am a well educated professional myself but have none of the luxury and &quot;connections&quot; Carpenter seems to have. As a quite &quot;elitist&quot; book, I suggest it only if you went to an Ivy League school and/or were &quot;born into&quot; money.

First of all, I was interested in the odd quirk of a linguist studying dialect and would have actually liked more details on this. The title suggested the &quot;language&quot; issue would be discussed, however, it really wasn't developed much more than as a plot device. This book was one of those mysteries that just keeps introducing more and more characters (and potential suspects) which confuses the plot terribly - even in the later chapters new characters appeared. I didn't find the immigrant isses as compelling as they may have been and were (in some ways) tangential to the story. Perhaps the book may be a fair &quot;local color&quot;-Southern-small-town story, etc. but it failed as a tightly written mystery.	2001-02-25

Do you have to Be Rich/Want to Be Rich to be a  &quot;Bo?&quot; Are we just aging 60's-70's (80's?) professionals? I'd like  a more serious approach to these questions, a &quot;sequel&quot; to what  Brooks began. It reflects some significant questions about values, personal  choices, media influences, etc. that deserve more serious discussion.	2000-06-16

Too much technical legal mumbojumbo about corporate shells and confusing ethnic semi-criminals. If I didn't care about the Southwest setting, I never would have finished it. I do like her down-to-earth protagonist,  Matty , but that's about it. I was mixed about Frieder's first book, and  this was worse. Just because frider is herself an attorney doesn't mean the  aveagre reader is can follow or is interested in legal details. My advice  is, skip it.	2000-06-12

It does not so much &quot;talk&quot; about space and place, but rather gives the reader a thoughtful experience of the subjectivities and meanings of space.  For example, Bachelard presents poetic interpretations of enclosures,  inside/outside, and other spatial phenomemon while applying it to such  entities as the nest, the shell, the corner, the drawer, etc. A work to  savor, slowly.	2000-06-03

The subtitle itself says it is a NOVEL about  M.Laveau (not a biography). It is its own novelistic, spell-weaving,  story-telling atmospheric quality that offers the book's gifts, not its  historiograpic accuracy. Ms.Parker Rhodes displays a high craft of language  and narrative that still haunts me.	2000-06-01

I did buy it, and when I read it to her (it has rather sophisticated vocabulary for young readers) I  loved it too. It's an interesting, graphic format, kind of  &quot;postmodern&quot; and fun!	2000-05-15

I don't mean intellectually complex, but rather there were a few plots going on at once, plus so many characters I couldn't remember who was  who and after a while didn't even care. It was like the author just kept on  making up more and more people that were possible suspects or in some way  involved in the murders. I don't recommend this book.	2000-04-14

I picked it up recently while on vacation and was taken by what a visually attractive book it is - beautiful graphics, high quality paper, conducive to  &quot;inner peace&quot; even before reading the text. I was surprised at  the low cost considering the high quality production. I just enjoy holding  and looking at it. But beyond that, the book is well organized and contains  many fruitful exercizes, is well written and inspirational. I recommend it!	2000-04-13

I understand that the disturbing nature of the work is the point of the book, but it was too depressing (and,as another reviewer noted, gratuitously so), that, rather than become engrossed, I became turned off and disappointed. I respect Ms.  Silko's reputation, and am generally interested in Native American issues,  but the Almanac's approach was too depressing/despressed to evoke my  empathy or even interest.	2000-04-07

I think the revisions in this 2nd edition complicate the work too much and make it less targeted and clear. I'd still recommend the first Kiersey version.	2000-04-07

The maps alone are worth it. Meinig represents the underpublicized geographic view of history, giving a different and needed perspective in American studies. All three of his works in this  series are excellent. Following on his earlier work in historical  geography, Meinig's position shows how regions, rather than political  divisions of &quot;states&quot; contribute to our nation's development, as  well as showing how the &quot;state&quot; concept applies. This  book,focusing on Western expansion, Civil War, sectionalism, etc. further  represents the important geographic influences in development of the  &quot;United&quot; States of America. This book should be of interest to  any general reader wanting a serious and unique view of socio-historical  studies.	2000-04-06

Relationship and relational variables are underrepresented. Or  course, MCO's require this more specified approach, but  books (and series)  such as the &quot;Complete&quot; Treatment Planner reduce our professional  work to an easier-than-it-really-is perspective, and as a result, devalue  professional experience as well as client/patient contibutions and  collaborations in psychotherapy. While I appreciate the author's attempts  to simplify a rather complex undertaking, is is disturbing to see  psychotherapy presented almost like auto mechanics. I understand that  Jonqsma and Peterson fill a need but the format and construction of this  book leave me wondering about the human side of the psychotherapy endeavor.	2000-04-06

Like the authors, I don't believe that &quot;behavior mod&quot; is the way to go with lots of kids - it treats them like machines...the behavioral model was originally  designed in experiments with animals, and takes any &quot;human&quot;  quality out.          I also have a daughter who is having some behavior  problems, and the book's approach works better with her than more  &quot;traditional&quot; programs. I give the authors a lot of credit for  going beyond the status quo in thinking how to work with a child.	2000-02-25
