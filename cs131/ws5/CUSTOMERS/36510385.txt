I am not a fanatic who reaches for my crysknife at every inconsistency, but I miss Frank Herbert's world. The elder Herbert had the ability to make readers despise heroes, while House Corrino's characters...all the heroes are magnificent and flawless, the villains are blockheads. <br />Many sections of the book made me laugh (although sometimes this was when the book was supposed to be deep and meaningful), but other sections were remarkably dull. I found myself skipping whole chapters to follow the plotlines I thought were interesting, and forcing myself to go back and read. In fact, most of the early part of the book was read out of duty.<br />I thought the earlier prequels in the trilogy more interesting. I really enjoyed House Atreides, and House Harkonnen was all right, too. But House Corrino is dull.	2003-12-01

He thinks he finds this person in Elizabeth Lackersteen, but slowly realizes how shallow and arrogant she really is.<br />It addresses issues like race and assimilation well, and has interesting characters, but I felt detached and bored while reading it. The plot is rather outlandish, and the ending was predictable, though the book has a lot of irony and even laugh-out-loud moments.<br />An OK book, but I expected more from Orwell.	2003-11-10

She is determined to rid her beautiful land of the Sasanach(English invaders).<br />To unite Ireland, Magheen forsakes true love and marries into a powerful Sean-Ghall(foreigners who have accepted the Irish ways) family. This brings her much sorrow, especially when King Henry does his last act of treachery...<br />I thought Magheen was too stereotypical a heroine, a little too perfect.

Reading this book, you watch their transition into adulthood, the loss of innocence and the pain that comes with it. The stories are all very different. There is the story of a girl who tries to buy back all the clothes of her mother's her father gave away when her mother died. There is the story of a hardworking, honest boy, and his cousin, who flees when the going gets rough, but comes back for the glory.

Hiroshima No Pika(Hiroshima's Flash) is mostly focused on a child, Mii, and, as we all know, the bombing of Hiroshima in WWII.<br />The detailed descriptions of people dying all around make this book perhaps not one suited for young audiences. The semi-abstract and disturbing pictures further add to this effect.<br />Many of the reviews dis this book, claiming that it is \\"one-sided\\", and does not tell about some of the horrid things the Japanese did in WWII. Hiroshima No Pika is not about those things---it's purpose is to provide us with a glimpse of what happened that day, the fear, the confusion, and the lingering effects of the radiation.

This book helps to chop that image a little more down to size: it portrays Oskar as rather hedonistic, unfaithful to his wife(one girlfriend, an affair with his secretary, the list goes on...). But, being disturbed by his regime's ways, he actually decided to do something about it, namely, set up a haven for Jews, under the disguise of an armaments factory. And it just so happened that he was really rich, so he could pay off all the necessary bribes, and had a lot of connections, or he would have landed in a prison or concentration camp himself long ago. It tells his story from a much more human perspective. <br />Schindler's List also attempts to delve into the psyches of various people in various positions, from the noble people who sacrificed themselves to the civilians who mocked and hated the Jews. It also zeroes in on specific incidents that are not so important in the big scheme of things, but are crucial in the life of an individual. <br />Schindler's list also does a good job of exploring the face of evil, and how \\"All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing\\"---Edmund Burke	2003-01-27

At the beginning of the book, Simon crashes his car into the Liberty Tree, where Jessup Wildemere was hung. Was it an accident caused by the frogs all over the road, or a suicide attempt? No one believes it was a suicide attempt, after all, Simon is a \\"good boy\\".<br />Either way, Simon lies in a coma, and his family and the cheating ring to which he, as the hacker, is key, nervously watch as Simon clings to life. <br />His family includes his sister and his father. His mother died a while back---since then, his sister has begun smoking marijuana to ease the pain, while Simon has kept it all inside, though he sometimes thinks he sees her ghost. <br />The cheating ring is composed of 3 other people, including Devin, a girl Simon's secretly in love with, and the reason he even decided to help them get test answers off the school database. Unfortunately, Devin is the girlfriend of another one of the people in the cheating ring.<br />The cheating ring is under suspicion, and police come to Simon's house and take away his computer for investigation.<br />Meanwhile, Simon, in a coma, experiences an out-of-body experience, during which he talks with Jessup Wildermere. Simon finds out that Jessup is not unlike him, in love with someone who doesn't love him back. Simon finds out what truly happened to Jessup, and is shocked by what he finds.<br />This book was very touching, a little spooky, and a great peek into the mind of a troubled social outcast and goody-goody.

The children and mother move in with the children's paternal grandmother, an independent woman who lives far from the civilized bustle of New York the kids are used to.<br />Much of the book is about how the kids adjust to country life. Despite how Lou initially looks down upon the people who live there, she slowly comes to...well, she strikes up friendships with some of them. Then the farm their grandmother owns is threatened...<br />Throughout this, the kids have to deal with their mother, who is always there, but never really THERE.<br />This is the kind of book that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Many people, after reading Tom Sawyer, seem to think of Huck as Tom's little sidekick. This book shows that Huck is very much his own man. After hanging around on the streets for most of his life, Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Eventually, Huck is kidnapped by his own father, a drunk and negligent man. Huck escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped after overhearing that his owners were planning to sell him.<br />As Jim and Huck float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who at first was very much against aiding Jim's escape, slowly comes to realize that slaves are people.<br />Huck's comments about how Jim seems to be just like him or any other white person are not dumb or rascist, they are part of Huck's relearning, and breaking of the stereotypes he has grown up with.<br />That is not to say this book is only an exploration of serious matters. It has Mark Twain's usual jokes and funny sequences, during which Huck fakes his own death, Huck and Jim cross-dress,<br />Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid, and Huck and Jim rescue each other many, many times and become friends, something that Huck didn't think was possible.	2002-12-30

The same people who play violent video games and listen to violent music would love this play(I know, I know, I'm stereotyping, but more young adults do this than seventy-year-olds). In King Lear, people's eyes are gouged out and other people are impaled on swords.<br />At the beginning, King Lear decides to step down from the throne and divide the kingdom amongst his three daughters, Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. First, he asks each of them how much she loves him. Goneril and Regan suck up grandly to their father, but Cordelia says that her love cannot be described, and says nothing. King Lear disowns Cordelia, who then flees to the king of France, who says that, despite the fact that she is disowned, he wants to marry her.<br />As soon as Cordelia leaves, Goneril and Regan betray their father, who leaves, saddened that the two daughters he thought loved him turned against him.<br />Meanwhile, the Earl of Gloucester is also tricked by his \\"bad\\" son Edmund into thinking that his \\"good\\" son Edgar is \\"bad\\", and Gloucester tries to kill Edgar. Eventually, Edgar is the one who leads the earl after Lear's daughter gouges his eyes out.<br />Shakespeare is the original soap-opera writer, but usually, there is a theme or themes to his stories, in this case, don't trust heresy and flattery.<br />Of course, all of this results in tragedy: most the \\"bad guys\\" and the \\"good guys\\" end up dying...King Lear dies, heartbroken, after Cordelia is executed.	2002-12-30

Young Paul Atreides must move to this thirsty planet when it is given his father, Duke Leto Atreides, after the Harkonnens, rivals of the Atreides, are kicked off. Through treachery and deceit, the Harkonnen manage to oust the Atreides once again, by killing Duke Leto. Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, barely manage to escape into the desert, where they are taken in by the Fremen. <BR>   Along the way, Paul discovers his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach, a legendary being who has the power to see through time and space.

In this book, Iris Chang recounts the story of the Rape of Nanking, the main incident that drives a wedge of enmity between the Japanese and Chinese to this day. When Japanese soldiers descended on Nanking, they slaughtered, in cold blood, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. The book was so \\"to the point\\" in its horror(pictures of piles of bodies and severed heads included) that it made me want to throw up. I think the book did a good job in describing an event that very few people in the West know of. It is just right in the amount of disgust and types of emotions it evokes in people. However, it could have been more exciting, vivid, and explored some segments more deeply. Totally too gruesome for children, but the rest of us owe it to ourselves to read it, and attempt to prevent such things from happening later.<br />In response for all those people who ask why Chang doesn't give us a lecture on the atrocity of A-bombs or other incidents against humanity, her story was not about the Holocaust, or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We cannot deny that these were horrendous as well, but we must also, when faced with the evidence, deal with the fact that the Japanese did in fact do this, and put aside for a moment whether or not Chang is biased. By arguing about the number of people who were killed or whether Chang is being unfair, we are only muting the voices of the victims. The most important thing is to realize that one isolated event cannot be used to judge an entire nation, nor should it be forgotten.	2002-11-17

Most of the sharecroppers are black families who plant on white land, then have to pay the white owners more of their earnings than is fair. Cassie's family is lucky, they own their own plot of land, and she has never really thought about being black, or white. Until she is publicly humiliated by a white girl, riders come in the night, looking to hurt and kill blacks accused of crimes they didnt' commit, and a boy named TJ Avery is sentenced to jail for life, accused of murdering a man...<br />This is one of those books that you wish wasn't dubbed as a childrens' book, so more adults would have the chance to enjoy it.	2002-11-03

The parents are unwilling to believe this, and protect the brother, even to the extent of sacrificing an innocent person's life, and the main character, Paul's, eyesight. But Tangerine is a strange town where buried truths are laid bare...	2002-11-03

The main character is one such fireman, his job to burn books(from where the book gets it's title---fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns), and doesn't think twice about it. But gradually, he meets people he finds perplexing, a girl who talks about rain tasting like wine, a woman who stays with her books until she is burned alive. His life is transformed when he hides a book, and opens it...<BR>Very engaging, but at times, so deep it makes your head spin.	2002-11-03

Interesting how democratic America had its roots in such unfairness, and how, despite how much civilization has progressed, the strong still often team up against the weak, and people aren't willing to stand up for the truth.<BR>It takes place during a time of suspicion, the Salem Witch trials. A girl named Abigail is given the power to decide who is a witch(and should therefore die), and who isn't. She uses this power to get revenge on the wife of the man she loves. Little does she know that, eventually, this man is killed, as are many other good people in the village.	2002-11-03

It is sad and engulfing, with snippets of irony, that gets the message across with the help of bright pictures.	2002-11-03

The Woman in White is definitely not one of them. Sure, it is, in the style of other Victorian-esque novels, rather frilly and verbose, but it is immensely better than the cheap one-layer mystery movies of the present-day. One of the things that makes it interesting is that it is told from many points of view, and delves deep into each character. It is about impersonation and greed, and features a character that is noble-looking but cruel, a character that is ugly but smart(unlike many antagonists that seem to be equipped with both beauty, brains, and an ability to find clues that are scarcely there), a character that is beautiful but stale, and a drawing tutor that just happened to wander into all of this when, one day, he unknowingly helped a lady clad all in white escape from a mental institution in the middle of the night.	2002-11-03

Sonny is...sensitive, but not necessarily weak, afraid, but not afraid to admit it, and dispels all myths that teenagers are simple-minded creatures. Another great coming-of-age type story!	2002-11-03

It was much more than a fairy tale, though, it was deep, serious, and gave you enough details to draw your own conclusions, without making any conclusions of its own. The book starts out fine and dandy---animals overthrowing their human masters. But certain groups among the animals(the pigs), begin taking over, assuming superiority over the other animals and becoming the very human masters they all despised in the first place. Throughout the book, the pigs twist the law to their own ends, manipulating the ignorant and trusting nature of the other animals. The book offers an interesting peek into what might actually happen if the anarchists had their way, and how even the most \\"fair\\" of situations, and \\"fairest\\" of people, are fallible, and eventually become corrupt. Though it is a satire against Communism, the events in the book could happen to any government.	2002-11-03

He makes it his goal to detect the frauds in life. This book chronicles his adventures with nuns, roomates, prostitutes, and people of all sorts after he leaves Pencey Prep, a school he claims is full of phonies.<BR>I thought it did not seem to have much of a point, though it poignantly explored the relationships Holden had with some of the other characters, especially his sister, Phoebe...	2002-11-03
US	36510385	R3CKF2TAACG1LI	0671722719	43217624	Julius Caesar (The New Folger Library Shakespeare)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Intense	Shakespeare gives a whole new face to history, transforming Caesar's assassination into a conspiracy, in which the conspirators have some reluctancy to join in. Brutus, for example, is deeply tormented, as Caesar is his friend and trusts him, but he is manipulated by Cassius, who makes Brutus believe that his duty to the people of Rome should be greater than friendship, and that the Romans want Caesar dead. The book is an exploration into the human psyche, and changing characters. I find it interesting that, though the play is called \\"Julius Caesar\\", its central character is Brutus, who has to deal with the guilt of betrayal versus what he feels is a duty to the people versus his love of Caesar. Intense, breathtaking, dramatic.	2002-11-03

The narrator, LaVaughn, gets a job babysitting for Jolly, an unmarried, teenage mother of two children. LaVaughn has to decide whether or not to leave for a better job, and comes face-to-face with a reality she has henceforth been shielded from. It is so real, and it took me awhile to find it in the library---it was always checked out.	2002-11-03

It was a simple, normal, coming-of-age, feeling-out-human-relationships-and-what-the-world-has-to-offer story, set in a time of turmoil. Tomi, age 13, who has previously tried to avoid, as much as possible, his Japanese ancestry and just become a normal American kid(playing baseball; speaking only English; has a best friend who is kimpatsu, or blond), he must face the prejudice against him, and cherish Japanese culture and the things it has to offer. Though it is sad, it is a feelgood book, and written exactly like a thirteen year old would have said it.	2002-11-03

You can just imagine them, riding away in the gray mists of morning...<BR>The characters are well-developed and thought out, and the plot is intense, but thoughtful and moody.	2002-11-03

It just goes to show,never judge a book by its cover. I didn't find it particularly horrid, but it was rather stale, contained too much unnecessary sex, and the only word I can find to describe it is...adequate. It wasn't really great like I would have expected it to be, but, then again, it did have a lot to live up to (all the prestigious awards and the thrilling mysticism of the Trojan War and mythology), so I gave it the benefit of doubt. Minus the fantastical elements, the sex, the historical context, it is good, a book about sibling rivalry and human relationships.	2002-11-03

We attempted to use the Bene Gesserit to force kids away from drinking fountains, turn our eyes the deep blue of the spice addiction, and were constantly discussing what it would be like to be on a planet where it never rains(partially since we live in Oregon, where it seems like it's ALWAYS raining).<BR>Dune is complex, a skillfully created tapestry, each thread a different character or situation to follow to the end, not just chopped off abruptly at some point like in poorly written books or ideas. Warning: may cause health hazards to people who are looking for a &quot;simple book&quot;.	2002-10-20

Though it deals with very real issues, it also deals with reality, and whether consciousness is a dream, and dreams are reality, and whether the two are so dependent upon one another that it is impossible to be only one. That we are all Awake and Dreaming.<BR>The person at the center of the story is Theo, who is being raised by a single mother who is much like a child herself. Clean clothes and good food are not things Theo knows much about. <BR>The setting is British Columbia, Canada, not an often written about place, and the book itself is just beautiful.	2002-10-20

This is a typical fantasy book, and then again it is not. <BR>It is about a disenchanted guy, Ben Holiday, living the city life, trying to get over his wife's death. One day, he stumbles upon an advertisement in a catalogue: \\"MAGIC KINGDOM FOR SALE\\". Amused at first at the ridiculousness, Ben is slowly drawn in by the fairy-tale-like idea of knights in shining armor and wizards and castles. <br />Unfortunately, life as the king of a magic kingdom is not all it is cracked up to be, as Ben soon discovers. He begins to despair when most of the kingdom's subjects are distrustful and refuse to help him, and his only followers are a group of misfits. Things only become worse when a demon lord challenges Ben to a duel he cannot possibly hope to win without help.<br />This is a very good book, about human relationships, and how courageous even ordinary people can be.	2002-10-20

However, that is not to say that this book was bad. It has plenty of humor(something that's hard to find in books where people get killed), and an amazing heroine. It is, though, farflung and a bit confusing.	2002-10-20

The beginning is kind of slow-paced, but it gets a lot better. Dicey's Song is not for those who like only adventure stories, and find books that actually delve into the character's personality \\"boring\\". I normally don't like sentimental books myself, but Dicey's Song is much more than that. It's uplifting and upsetting, happy and sad, just as the heroine is a contradictory character, struggling with love, family, tragedy,life, and everything in between.	2002-10-20
