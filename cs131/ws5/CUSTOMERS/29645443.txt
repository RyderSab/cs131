There are so many things but I would have to say how utterly romantic it is--and I am not even talking about the sizzling sex. The way Sax and Jude look into each other's eyes, the way the color of their eyes change depending on their moods, the way their body language speaks volumes filling in where the dialogue leaves off, and the way I get so caught up in the action that I don't even realize that the world around me exists. Radclyffe is adept at creating a complete picture while allowing the reader's imagination to fill in the rest. It is a fine balance between telling too much and too little. I think Rad gets it just right. I have a couple of references but I don't want to cite text and include spoilers. You will have to trust me on this.<br /><br />I am so drawn to these characters that I want to<br /><br />be with them, be like them, live their lives...<br /><br />Have you ever seen a person grinning from ear to ear on a treadmill going almost four miles per hour, oblivious to the sweat pouring down her neck and into her eyes, and all the noise of an active family all around her? Well that was me when I was reading \\"Passion's Bright Fury.\\" And I thought I couldn't put \\"Safe Harbor\\" down.<br /><br />\\"Passion's Bright Fury\\" is a five plus star read and should not under any circumstances be missed.	2005-10-04
US	29645443	R15TYGS9D8BP02	1933110139	947535878	Safe Harbor	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Review of "Safe Harbor" by Cheri Rosenberg	Award-winning writer Radclyffe lists among her bestselling novels \\"Safe Harbor,\\" in which Reese Conlon leaves a military career to become Provincetown's new Deputy Sheriff. Once there, she finds herself fighting homophobia, which is directed at P-Town's local youth. While upholding the law, Reese also discovers truths about herself when she meets and falls in love with Dr. Victoria (Tory) King.<br /><br />\\"Safe Harbor\\" has a character driven plot and presents a diverse well-defined supporting cast with each having an integral contribution to the story. The main character, Reese, is easy to fall in love with. An extremely private person, she has everyone curious to know more about her. \\"She's handsome, strong, sensitive, tender, and deeply passionate. And devoted-can't beat that,\\" according to her creator Radclyffe; Reese turns more than a few heads. Comparable to a knight in shining armor, she is hard-working, decent, and honest. Reese upholds the law and takes her oath `to serve and protect' very seriously. Her boss, Sheriff Nelson Parker, and other locals are in awe of this admirable woman.<br /><br />Sheriff Parker has a lot more than crime to deal with when he learns his daughter Brianna is gay. Radclyffe does a commendable job of describing the anguish he feels as he works his way, hopefully, toward acceptance.<br /><br />Reese meets Dr. King while out on patrol to check on a break in at the East End Health Clinic. Tory has an \\"unanticipated visceral reaction\\" (p. 21) to the precise, professional, and truly stunning sheriff. Having endured a bad breakup and an accident that dashed her Olympic hopes to bits, Tory is leery of a gorgeous, self-assured woman, and she's unnerved that she's so taken with Reese. Trying not to fall for Reese's charm is a daunting task-especially when Reese says things like, \\"I saw you this morning-kayaking out on the bay. You were so much a part of the sea that you didn't even disturb the rhythm of the waves\\" (p. 31). Tory endears the reader with her professional manner while adeptly healing the sick in her care. Dr. King is a respected physician who puts other's needs before her own. In hopes of avoiding further heartache, she adamantly tries to deny love. Can she learn to trust Reese and more importantly, can she trust her own feelings?<br /><br />Brianna (Bri) Parker, the sheriff's gay daughter, is a tough, troubled, and frightened youth who becomes the target of gay bashing. Although strong, Bri is no match for her attacker. Reese helps Brianna overcome obstacles that she and other gay teens face. Surprisingly, even the \\"gay Mecca\\" of P-town has its share of hatred. Reese helps not only Bri, but all the other gay kids in her jurisdiction to fight against homophobia.<br /><br />Tory's sister, Cath, acts as Tory's conscience, playing devil's advocate as she wrestles with her heart and mind. When Tory thinks, \\"[Reese] has no idea what she's doing-she hasn't a clue to the effect she has on any lesbian with a heartbeat\\" (p. 111), in fact, Reese has no idea what she does to straight women and men either. Cath may be a straight, married, mother of two, but she empathizes with her sister and can fully appreciate how Tory feels about Reese.<br /><br />\\"Safe Harbor\\" is a love story, a coming out story, and crime drama all rolled into one. When Reese was young, her mother Kate left home to be with her lover, Jean. She reconnects with her mother not knowing what to expect. She also must deal with her father's reaction to the news that she's gay.<br /><br />Caring deeply about an author's characters, yearning to find out what happens next, feeling like you're a part of the action, and hating for it to end, is what great novels are all about. \\"Safe Harbor\\" by Radclyffe is such a novel. From the beginning, Radclyffe uses mystery and foreshadowing to keep the reader interested, and there is never a dull moment. The fabulous setting is the perfect backdrop and makes the reader long for a trip to Provincetown,with its \\"Mardi Gras energy\\" (p. 90).<br /><br />A great story, memorable characters, fresh dialogue, important issues, scenic descriptions, an engaging plot and meticulous editing makes \\"Safe Harbor\\" a five star novel that can be enjoyed by both a gay and straight audience. I highly recommend \\"Safe Harbor\\" and anything penned by award winning novelist Radclyffe, whose recent accolades include two 2005 Golden Crown Literary Awards for \\"Fated Love\\" and \\"Justice in the Shadows.\\"ip to Provincetown, with its \\"Mardi Gras energy\\" (p. 90). <br /> <br />A great story, memorable characters, fresh dialogue, important issues, scenic descriptions, an engaging plot and meticulous editing makes \\"Safe Harbor\\" a five star novel that can be enjoyed by both a gay and straight audience.

The anthology is contemporary, yet timeless, not only about sex, but also about love, longing, lust, surprises, chance meetings, planned meetings, fulfilling wild fantasies, and trust. Radclyffe is a masterful storyteller devising subtle plots, interesting settings, and developing believable characters, which don't get in the way of the hot sex scenes.<br /><br />Radclyffe paints her characters using just enough brushstrokes to give the reader a whole portrait. When one lover states, \\"She had the hands of a magician, the mouth of a saint, and she could read me as if I were a billboard lighting up the night in Times Square\\" [p. 134], it's easy to imagine how much she appreciates her lover.<br /><br />\\"Full Service Station\\" made me laugh out loud when the main character was so horny she thought, \\"The waitress in the diner, a friendly gem of a woman about one year older than God, made my pulse trip. Hell, even inanimate objects such as trees and fireplugs were beginning to appeal\\" [p. 14]. The scene became funnier as it went on but you'll have to read the book to see what I mean. This is a mere sampling of Radclyffe's humor sprinkled throughout the text.<br /><br />\\"Runway Blues\\" was great! Who hasn't fantasized about meeting a stranger at an airport after the trials and tribulations of trying to fly somewhere on a holiday weekend? Or maybe you've been to the Red Light District in Holland as in \\"A Woman in the Shadows,\\" or longed for a massage as in \\"Four Star Accommodations,\\" or perhaps a luxurious bath as in \\"Hart's Desire.\\" If you've ever gone toy shopping in a sex shop, you'll love \\"Happy, Happy Birthday, Baby.\\" Contemplating a piercing? You have to read \\"Pleasure Points!\\" All of the twenty-five stories are diversified enough to keep you interested, and are sexy enough to keep you hot.<br /><br />The build-up, humor, and satisfaction are evident and incredible; Radclyffe gives her readers the pay-off they long for and have come to expect. Trust me when I say that you are going to need a fan, cold shower, partner, or whatever floats your boat, to quell the fire you'll feel while reading \\"Change of Pace: Erotic Interludes.\\" Three of my favorite stories are the \\"Clinical Trials - Phase One: Calibrations,\\" \\"Clinical Trials -  Phase Two: Video,\\" and \\"Clinical Trials - Phase Three: Assist Mode,\\" but I highly recommend you read all of Radclyffe's \\"Change of Pace: Erotic Interludes\\" and choose your own favorite.

Brandy gives sex \\"lessons\\" to the curious and primarily straight women who frequent Club Sandzibel. After one of her morning stretch classes, Brandy gives a quick lesson to a guest named Paige, but soon tires of such dalliances. \\"... the allure of straight-but-looking-for-thrills Paiges had paled along the way\\" (p. 4). During breaks and time off, Brandy hangs out, and ultimately falls in love with her best friend Tess, a fellow instructor who sleeps around-with men! Will Brandy ever find her true love?<br /><br />The tropical setting for \\"All the Wrong Places\\" makes you feel like packing up and heading for a vacation to the alluring paradise, especially when the Ladies on Vacation Enterprises (LOVE), a large group of lesbians, heads for some fun in the sun. Brandy cannot believe her luck when she discovers Club Sandzibel will be host to the members of LOVE for a whole week. One of the guests happens to be the famous lesbian comedienne, Celine Griffin. When Celine shows an interest in Brandy, it's her dream come true and the fantasy of a lifetime fulfilled. Will a tryst with Celine be enough to satisfy Brandy over the long run?<br /><br />Kallmaker frequently had me laughing out loud, for instance, when Brandy thinks,  \\"...I didn't think I could ask her to do that for me through some sort of cling plastic wrap...I mean, it's just not what most people think of when they're glad they've got Glad\\" (p. 56). When I wasn't laughing, I was engrossed in the plot. It was easy to root for Brandy's success at finding love and resolving her issues with her homophobic family, while at the same time enjoying some hot sex scenes. The most notable performance is between Brandy and Celine, (you may want to read this one twice!), but the romps between Brandy and Tess were equally sexy and even more appealing because of love. Kallmaker's style is clear, crisp, believable, and fun.<br /><br />Karin Kallmaker is a prolific writer who is not only a crowd pleaser, but in my opinion, a great storyteller. You can read \\"All the Wrong Places\\" in one sitting, but you'll want to savor each delectable detail. Kallmaker deserves her numerous accolades, and I'm sure her loyal fans will just love this one as well. \\"All the Wrong Places\\" is recommended for both serious fans of erotica and romance as well as anyone who enjoys good, hot storytelling.aling because of love.

She is the author of twenty (and counting) published novels. Her writing is posted on-line, included in anthologies, and is available in other venues. Not surprisingly, \\"Justice in the Shadows\\" is a 2005 Golden Crown Literary Society award finalist.<br /><br />In the latest Justice book, two cops have been assassinated, a young girl is dead, and an innocent woman lies in a coma, all the result of a child pornography ring. Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) Detective Sergeant Rebecca Frye wants to find out who is behind the murders of her partner Jeff Cruz, Officer Jimmy Hogan, a young prostitute, and the attempted murder of J.T. Sloan...that is until Clark Avery, the Justice Department Investigator, pulls the plug on the investigation. Something reeks of an inside job and Rebecca Frye will not rest until justice is done; she does not intend to add the unsolved case to the dead pile. Captain Henry gives the okay for Frye to head her own secret task force to see what she can uncover.<br /><br />Rebecca puts together a team of unlikely candidates including her new partner, Detective William Watts, internet sleuth J.T. Sloan, and Sloan's business associate Jason McBride. Other members of her team include rookie cop, Dellon Mitchell; young prostitute and certified informant, Sandy; and Rebecca's lover, PPD psychiatrist Dr. Catherine Rawlings. With a great cast of characters, the reader can't help but root for each one. Sloan's lover, Michael Lassiter, lies in a coma after she becomes a mistaken target meant for Sloan...who will go to any lengths to avenge her attackers.<br /><br />Radclyffe is a master at combining intense police drama and mystery along with an in-depth look at three loving and fulfilling lesbian relationships. She keeps the reader interested, excited, and guessing; it's hard to put the book down. As always, Radclyffe's work has compelling narrative, enough conflict and drama to sustain the story, unforgettable characters, natural sounding and credible dialogue. In addition, her writing is a perfect example of how sex does not get in the way of the plot; the sex scenes move the plot along and add depth to her characters. The author shows us the tough exterior of Rebecca when she is commanding her team, then contrasts that with her tender side when she makes love to her soul mate, Catherine. The same can be said about the budding relationship between Mitchell and Sandy. Mitchell is a hotheaded young cop, while Sandy is a street wise, smart mouthed kid. The growth of these two characters is particularly captivating.<br /><br />As in all good series, several major story lines are resolved, while a few loose threads remain to keep us on edge for the next book in this series. I'm looking forward to the continuing adventures when \\"Justice Served\\" comes out June 2005. I recommend Radclyffe's \\"Justice in the Shadows\\" to anyone who enjoys intense crime stories with lots of intrigue, and with hot sex thrown in for good measure.

With a fast-paced gripping plot, memorable characters, both good and evil, action that doesn't stop, and scenes and dialogue that ring true for the underworld society of the porn industry, the story captures the reader from the very first page until the last.<br /><br />Brett Higgins is twenty-three, smart, and a college graduate employed in a job she finds fun and challenging. Brett's boss Rick DeSilva, the mogul of porn, owns an adult theater, an escort service, and a pornography distribution service with adult bookstores, phone sex service, and other similar enterprises; Brett is his first lieutenant. She works as his general manager and is the head of the advertising/marketing department. Brett may be on the wrong side of the law at times, but this reviewer likes and roots for the tough, sweet, and sensitive sides of the multi-faceted character. Brett does what she has to do to survive, as honestly as she can, and she goes to any length to keep those she loves safe.<br /><br />Frankie Lorenzini works closely with Rick and Brett as \\"security\\"-he watches their backs. The trio, Rick, Brett, and Frankie, are not only business associates; they are like family to one another.<br /><br />Brett has a woman in her life whom she loves and protects, an exquisite exotic dancer, Storm. Brett cares deeply for Storm but has never totally committed to her-then she meets Allison Sullivan. Allie is only seventeen, cute, pretty, and just coming out when she first lays eyes on Brett.<br /><br />Allie is attracted to Brett's dark, mysterious, and driven side. In addition, Allie feels that Brett is refreshingly different from her ex-girlfriend, Kirsten-a cheating control freak who took her for granted-which draws her to Brett even more. Kirsten doesn't accept the breakup as final and she tries to win Allie back, albeit dishonestly. Brett wonders if Allie is her soul mate. Can opposites attract and stay attracted? Allie is from a loving family on the right side of the tracks; Brett is from the wrong side. Can they remain a couple against all odds? Brett loves both Storm and Allie; she is hard-pressed to choose between them. Allie, on the other hand, knows exactly what she wants and hopes it lasts a lifetime. What will Brett decide-will it be Brett's decision to make? When people start ending up dead, some who are close to Brett, the police are not the only ones investigating the murders. Brett wants to find out too.<br /><br />Therese Szymanski is a master at devising plots that keep you guessing and then surprise you with their answers. She delivers rich imaginative text that is refreshingly real, to the point, and she paints vivid pictures that set the mood. The action sequences reflect the detail and flourish of Szymanski's award-winning playwright talents, as do the sizzling sex scenes. To say that they stimulate certain juices to flow is an understatement.<br /><br />\\"When the Dancing Stops\\" will enthrall readers who enjoy mysteries laced with sex, love, jealousy, greed, murder, and intrigue. There's no telling who will survive this rollercoaster ride. Once you read the first Brett Higgins Mystery, you will be eager to read the entire series just to see what Szymanski comes up with next.

Readers who enjoy action, adventure, intrigue, and a delightfully budding romance will find Hunter's Pursuit every bit as thrilling as Terminator. But instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Baldwin gives us Katarzyna Demetrious, alias Hunter-a mean, lean fighting machine! Hunter is a memorable and appealing heroine even though she is a trained killer, hired gun, and bounty hunter. The tables are turned however, when she learns there's a contract out on her. She's no longer the hunter. She is now the hunted.<br /><br />Hunter is holed up in her secluded bunker a few miles south of the Lake Superior shoreline. Usually a loner, she never allows intimacy to cloud her judgment. On one of her first outings from the safe house, Hunter witnesses a car accident and is torn whether or not to get involved. She prefers not to risk being found as she's close to retirement and is looking forward to a normal, quiet existence.<br /><br />Against her better judgment, she opts to save the victim, and takes the young woman back to her bunker. Although she suspects the mystery woman may be after the bounty on her head, Hunter can't ignore her feelings for the beautiful \\"patient.\\" Throughout the story, the longing and sexual tension between Kat and Jake is palpable and positively entrancing. Suffering amnesia from the accident, they decide to call the mystery woman, Jake. Uncharacteristically, Hunter tells Jake her real nickname (that few people know), Kat.<br /><br />Falling in love, intending to stay alive, and keeping her friend safe, has the usually restrained and cautious Hunter distracted. She's fearful of revealing too much of her clandestine life. As Jake tries to learn more about Kat's past, she asks, \\"So, you're a paramedic chef who plays a mean cello when she's not saving damsels in distress?\\" [p. 54] While Hunter is thinking about her growing affections for her captive, she's concerned with surviving the hardships of a treacherous Michigan blizzard, and, at the same time, fighting off would be assassins.<br /><br />Clever surprises and suspenseful drama resonate on each page setting the wheels in motion for an exciting ride. Action sequences fire rapidly in succession leaving the reader breathless. The total effect will have you riveted to Kim Baldwin's book. Once you pick up \\"Hunter's Pursuit,\\" there is no putting it down.

In the continuing saga about the amateur detective, wedding guests start acting weird after ingesting gourmet food catered by her company. WHO poisoned the food, WHAT did they use, WHERE was it executed, WHEN did they do it, and WHY... are the questions Jane wants to figure out. Never mind that the police have started their investigation. Jane could be found culpable, and wants to clear her company's name. Even if the wedding hadn't been for her friends, Nick and Lauren Clifford, and Nick hadn't ended up in critical condition from a drug-induced dive into an empty pool, Jane still would have had to solve the mystery. It's not surprising that she enlists the help of her trusty sidekick, Cordelia Thorn, if for nothing other than comic relief. Jane and Cordelia are just hysterical together and they make a perfect crime solving team.<br /><br />The fact that Cordelia, the creative director of a repertory theater, is a bit pre-occupied when her sister, Octavia, literally drops her kid in her aunt's lap and takes off for stardom, doesn't stop the dependable Cordelia from helping her best friend Jane. Cordelia is hardly the mother hen type and her life is disrupted beyond compare by the addition of niece Hattie. Ellen Hart depicts the toddler so convincingly that this reviewer almost got up on more than one occasion to prepare a \\"kid friendly\\" snack, but was reminded that she was just a fictitious character.<br /><br />Hart is not only a master mystery writer, but her storytelling is as delectable as restaurateur Jane Lawless's culinary treats. \\"An Intimate Ghost\\" is appetizing, fulfilling, and deliciously funny with Jane's deadpan humor and Cordelia's catchy comebacks.

This time they are going back to high school. . .as students. The interwoven elements of the plot, a writing style that Szymanski is known for, keep the reader guessing, and glued to the pages. The main theme is evident, but there is much more to discover under the surface in this fast-paced, action-packed, high school sting.<br /><br />Something sinister lurks in a small Michigan town outside St. Louis at Alma High School. A dedicated teacher at the school, Leisa Kraft, is duly worried about her students. Leisa hopes to find out what is going on before someone gets hurt. . .or worse. She enlists the help of her friend Madeline; together they come up with a brilliant plan. Leisa and Madeline ask Brett, who made her money in organized crime but is no longer in the biz, and Allison, a ex-cop who has experience as a detective, to pose as high school students in order to solve the mysterious change in the students. Brett and Allie are reluctant to get involved at first but they relent. Madeline and Leisa convince Brett and Allie to go undercover as brother and sister.<br /><br />Brett does a very convincing imitation of a delinquent teenage boy and Allie joins the cheerleading squad. Once enrolled in the school Brett and Allie fit right in-but can a thirty-three year old and twenty-seven year old really pull off the charade and discover the truth about what is going down in Alma High?<br /><br />Brett Higgins was twenty-three when she met her lover Allison Sullivan, who was seventeen at the time. Brett and Allie have a wonderful relationship. Allie has no problem when Brett flirts with other women since the bottom line is that Brett is hers-all hers. But for how long and under what circumstances can even Brett's resolve to be faithful withstand the test?<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"When Evil Changes Face\\" to anyone who enjoys good mysteries, juicy love stories, and hot steamy sex. It is fun revisiting high school (from an adult's perspective) with all the raging hormones, turf battles, sports, dramas, and teenage angst. The story is more than just erotica with its multi-faceted plot and complex characters; it keeps the reader guessing all along. The author does an amazing job of tying up the loose ends while setting the stage for the fifth Brett Higgins' Motor City Thrillers, \\"When Good Girls Go Bad.\\"<br /><br />You will not want to miss all six books in the Motor City Thriller series. The sixth title, \\"When the Corpse Lies (2004),\\" is the latest addition to the collection. Check out Therese Szymanski's other selections as well including, \\"Once Upon a Dyke: New Exploits of Fairy Tale Lesbians (2004),\\" which has been nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in 2005. \\"When Evil Changes Face\\" is a worthwhile read and rates five stars.<br />I highly recommend \\"When Evil Changes Face\\" to anyone who enjoys good mysteries, juicy love stories, and hot steamy sex.

US	29645443	R3T9MOUEIZKEJB	1930928440	386495914	Under The Gun	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Review of "Under the Gun" by Cheri Rosenberg	In the second gripping police drama in Lori L. Lake's Gun series, \\"Under the Gun\\" delightfully picks up where \\"Gun Shy\\" left off and sets the stage for the third novel, \\"Have Gun We'll Travel.\\" Once you make the acquaintance of Officer Desiree (Dez) Reilly and her partner and lover Rookie Officer Jaylynn (Jay) Savage, you won't be able to get enough of this dynamic duo. The two cops are as different as night and day in appearance and personality. Always the macho cop, Dez, affectionately referred to as \\"tall, dark, and dangerous,\\" maintains a tough impenetrable shell and demeanor to hide her fears. \\"[Jaylynn] liked the fact that there was a defensive fortress around her taciturn partner, but that the tall cop had let her find the few chinks in the armor so that she had free access to come and go as she pleased\\" (p. 378). Dez contains her emotions until the breaking point, while Jay is not embarrassed or afraid to show her feelings. \\"It occurred to [Dez] that one major thing she liked about Jaylynn was how alive she was. She took on life with zest, whether she was investigating a crime, talking on the phone, eating something tasty, making love, or crying at a sad movie\\" (p. 271).<br /><br />\\"Under the Gun\\" begins with Dez seemingly happy and hopelessly in love with Jay, the vivacious, light-haired bundle of energy, but at the same time, she is petrified of losing her, which is making her miserable. Jay is proving to be an excellent officer, but her impulsive streak has Dez worried, since Jay repeatedly ends up in harm's way. It's understandable that the introspective Dez, who withdraws and equates letting her guard down with being weak, is afraid of losing the one person who understands her, tolerates her moodiness, and who adds meaning, love, and joy to her life. Lake explores their evolving relationship with rich detail while Dez goes through the biggest transformation of all.<br /><br />Dez is so adept at concealing her inner turmoil that even she is not aware she's doing it. Having suffered serious traumatic events in her life including the loss of her beloved father, also a police officer, and her partner and close friend Officer Ryan Michaelson, Dez snaps and ends up suspended with her only alternatives being to see  psychiatrist Marie Montague, or be kicked off the force. Reluctantly, the skeptical secretive Dez works with Marie. Can Marie save Dez from self-destructing, and going to a very lonely and isolated place where she denies her heart's desire for fear of loss and rejection? Will the astute psychiatrist help Dez learn to bridge the gap in all of her severed relationships, including the ones with her mother Collette and her brother Patrick?<br /><br />Can Marie help Dez believe Luella, Dez's landlady and chief nurturer, who tells her, \\"You can't hold onto someone so tight that you choke the life out of them\\" [p. 280]. Luella tries to convince Dez that loving and losing someone is painful, but avoiding love to avoid pain is not the answer. She also tells her surrogate daughter, \\"You are a strong person, Desiree Reilly, and you deserve to love and be loved. But you have to make a choice to take the chance\\" [p. 280].<br /><br />Lori L. Lake's completely satisfying action/romance novel will engage a full range of emotions that will leave the reader wanting more. No stone is left unturned as all the loose ends are tied up. The psychological journey of the characters' growth and development, particularly Dez's, is just as intriguing as the crime drama, murder investigation, and police work. Every character, no matter how small their role, has a place and reason for being in the story. Lake does not rush through her narrative, but with the perfect pace, 490 pages go by in a blink.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Under the Gun\\" for the strong characterization, loveable characters, and absorbing plot. Anyone who enjoys a realistic look at police procedurals, romance, and psychological drama, will love following the story of Dez and Jay. Lake paints a vivid picture that allows the reader to jump into the story and become a part of Dez's world. It is not surprising that the sequel, \\"Have Gun We'll Travel,\\" is a finalist for a Golden Crown Literary Society 2006 Goldie Award. \\"Under the Gun\\" is a page-turner; read it and you will see what I mean.t allows the reader to jump into the story and become a part of Dez's world.

Being given an assignment that United States Secret Service Agent Cameron Roberts felt was beneath her she retorts to her superior officer, \\"I'm an investigator, not a goddamned baby-sitter.\\" She is after all, a senior agent with ten years of impeccable service and should have a say what her next job should be. Once the headstrong woman is resigned to the fact that she has no choice but to be the next Agent in Charge of protecting the safety of an equally strong-willed woman, who happens to be the daughter of the President of the United States, Commander Cameron Roberts is willing to put her life on the line for those in her care and lets nothing stand in her way in \\"Above All, Honor\\" by Radclyffe.<br /><br />Cameron Roberts thinks she's getting an easy job until she meets the stunning, willful, elusive, caged bird, Blair Allison Powell. Cameron's predecessor tells her that, \\"She's an angry animal in a cage, and you're the new zookeeper.\\" He also informs Cam that the \\"high-profile subject\\" has a \\"problematic lifestyle.\\" Blair's mission is to elude those who are hired to protect her in order to maintain some sense of freedom. Cameron's mission is to protect her while maintaining her privacy-if possible.<br /><br />The USSS Agent in charge before Cam steps in and gives the President's daughter an apropos code name: Egret. According to the New Merriam-Webster Dictionary, an Egret is \\"any of various herons that bear long plumes during the breeding season.\\" Blair barhops from one seedy place to another and most of the time she goes unnoticed. Who would expect the respectable first daughter to be frequenting bohemian gay bars? When on official White House business, Blair is quite the fancy diplomat. She rightfully yearns for a private life, which is virtually impossible, and until Cam Roberts comes along, nobody has any sympathy for her. She is not only trying to escape her life in a birdcage, but she has some painful memories of the past that have her haunted as well.<br /><br />Cam demands respect from those under her command and she gets it. She's shrewd, smart, has integrity, and strong work ethics-all of which result in glowing performance records. She has sharp gut instincts, amazing self-control, and is an expert at undercover work. Cam does not tolerate homophobia on her team. More to her credit, she has no qualms accepting the resignation of any officer who has a problem with the fact that Blair is gay. Cameron Roberts is an admirable hero worth emulating.<br /><br />Radclyffe's reference to \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" did not escape notice when Cam's report from her last assignment held all of her merits and facts without any of the story behind it. They noted the fact that her female partner was killed in action during the last sting, but it was not up for discussion that the partner had also been Cam's lover. Even though there were rumors that Cam was gay, they didn't ask and she didn't tell.<br /><br />Cam works hard to ignore Blair's advances. While Blair tries hard not to allow Cam to get under her skin. Is it possible for Cam and Blair to find love? According to Radclyffe, the essence of the entire Honor series is \\"the conflict between private and public lives, the balance between duty and love, and the incredible power of passion between strong-willed but sensitive people.\\"<br /><br />\\"Above All, Honor\\" is the first in the series of Honor books. After reading \\"Above All, Honor,\\" there is no doubt in my mind that I must read all of the sequels: \\"Honor Bound,\\" \\"Love and Honor,\\" and \\"Honor Guards.\\" I found \\"Above All, Honor\\" to be extremely fast reading, exciting, titillating, and realistic-especially the technically correct medical scene that one would expect from a surgeon. She equally and adeptly captures the essence of the secret service/police drama in her finely researched work. Radclyffe is a very talented, prolific, award-winning author who creates a believable and interesting story that will make you happy to become a \\"part of the team.\\"<br /><br />One of the things I like best about Radclyffe's writing is that even though she creates sexual tension and longing between the two main characters, at least she gives us tidbits-juicy ones I might add-along the way to quench our desire. The build-up is beautifully done and quite delightfully explicit, as is the climatic ending. A truly satisfying experience for all.<br /><br />I couldn't praise or rave about \\"Above All, Honor\\" any more than I am. It is a five plus star action/adventure/love story that will leave you breathless and hungry for more.happy to become a \\"part of the team.\\"  <br /> <br />One of the things I like best about Radclyffe's writing is that even though she creates sexual tension and longing between the two main characters, at least she gives us tidbits-juicy ones I might add-along the way to quench our desire.

Halfhill writes, \\"Jan sat on one side of a well-worn sofa that faced a large multi-pane window. Cheerful sunlight shot prisms through the waxy glass illuminating a galaxy of dust particles floating in the heavy Victorian style room. He sensed the d&eacute;cor was meant to make clients fell comfortable-instead, it made him feel as if he were in a confessional box at Saint Dominic's Academy.\\" (p. 6)<br /><br />In \\"Scimitar,\\" Jan Phillips is more powerful at twenty-nine and certainly less naïve than the eighteen-year-old underprivileged lost boy who first entered the world of the elusive Tim Morris. The story continues. . . Jan is a successful attorney in the late Tim's prominent law firm, The Templars of Law. Jan is seeking absolution from the guilt, pain, and emptiness he feels because of Tim's unexpected death. Tim left his vast wealth to Jan, and, by default, he has become the North American master of the Mundus Society-a clandestine organization that operates outside the realm of international law. What Jan really misses is Tim's love and companionship.<br /><br />Having been bought and paid for by Tim, Jan wonders what his life would have been like had he led a normal life, and had been free to choose his own destiny. What would have happened if Tim hadn't gotten him involved in Mundus, if Jan hadn't fallen in love with him, and Tim hadn't died leaving him with an overwhelming legacy?<br /><br />\\"Jan recalled a line from the Bible that defined this sense of loss perfectly-the years that the locust hath eaten. But of course the relationship ended and the days and months without Tim were forever snatched back into a void where he could never follow.\\" [p. 136]. In this eloquent description, Halfhill shows the deep sadness Jan feels whenever he remembers Tim. Jan even keeps the St. Roi apartments just as Tim left them as a tribute to his lover's memory.<br /><br />The flashbacks are not the main attraction of Scimitar, but rather serve to enrich the complicated plot involving the Mundus Society. Jan is thrown into Project Scimitar in his first official business when escapees of the African Slave Trade show up asking for his help. Jan would like to send them on their way, but he can't help but feel that he must somehow assist the two youths, apparently from Cirque Afrique, who show up in the middle of the night, on his doorstep-naked. His involvement becomes imperative when one of them carries the international emblem of the Mundus Society, with the official seal of the African Chapter. Unsure exactly how to proceed, Jan enlists the help of Tim's friends and contacts, including a physician, Max Atwater. This is the first step as Jan becomes more involved in the dangerous world of Sudanese slave traders.<br /><br />Sonia Santos has replaced her mother and now runs the household at St. Roi; Jan and Sonia represent the next generation to inhabit the apartment surrounded by its surreptitious world. Han, his bodyguard, Joachim Nusbaum, and Daniel, Jan's cousin, have joined the team for Project Scimitar.<br /><br />Even though the author leaves some of the characters' plots unresolved, it serves to entice the reader to read the next novel in the series. There is some question about what happened to Kevin, the kidnapped, mutilated missionary's boy. And what happened to Jan's love interest, Michael? These unresolved issues loom in the air and add to the intrigue, and beguile the reader to read Sons, when it becomes available.<br /><br />Michael Halfhill has firmly established himself as a writer who allows the reader to use his or her imagination. Halfhill's descriptions include, \\"Makeshift markets filled with vendors peddling every imaginable ware crowded the cobblestone alleys that led into the heart of the city.\\" [p. 179] This, and many other examples of the writing style of Michael Halfhill, conjure up vivid images whereby the reader need not go far into the recesses of their brain to imagine the scene. Yet the author does not spoon-feed the story, he simply makes the reader hungry for more.  The humor and intrigue of Michael Halfhill's novel, interwoven with his impressive narrative and action-filled plot twists, earn \\"Scimitar\\" five stars.many other examples of the writing style of Michael Halfhill, conjure up vivid images whereby the reader need not go far into the recesses of their brain to imagine the scene.

US	29645443	R1ENIN1TY6UO5U	0758206178	361062878	The Trouble Boy	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Review of "The Trouble Boy" by Cheri	Tom Dolby has accurately captured the essence of what makes twenty-something preppy gay men on the Upper East Side of Manhattan tick in his refreshing and honest novel \\"The Trouble Boy.\\" A native of San Francisco, Toby Griffin is a privileged Yale graduate who majored in film studies. Toby confides, \\"After a sexless four years at boarding school, I was ready to sleep with every available gay undergrad in the tristate area.\\" [p. 3] Having had his fill of meaningless one-night stands he is more mature now at twenty-two, and is looking for the one guy that he can spend the rest of his life with. He moves to the Big Apple with dreams of fame, fortune, and a long-term relationship. His accomplished wealthy parents-his mother is a famous fashion designer and his father made his fortune at a firm specializing in biotechnology-have given him one year to prove himself in NYC, if not he has to go back home and work in his father's business. Talk about pressure...Toby's parents succeeded in their careers while still in their twenties and expect no less from their progeny.<br /><br />\\"The Trouble Boy\\" begins with Toby meeting Jamie Weissman who introduces him to the guys who become his friends in Manhattan. A Princeton graduate, Jamie is an investment banker, hardly the type of guy Toby would assume was gay. Jamie introduces himself to Toby at the type of party \\"...where people don't talk to anyone they don't know already.\\" [p. 1]. Jamie tells Toby about a job opening for a freelance writer at a web site called CityStyle.com. Toby becomes their nightlife editor and reviews nightclubs and interviews rent boys. The job has its perks including many opportunities for sex, drugs, and alcohol. Even after landing a job, Toby never loses sight of his dream to become a famous screenwriter despite his parents' desire for him to get a \\"real job\\" and have a respectable career. Toby is determined to succeed and when one job ends, he lands a more lucrative position as the personal assistant to an unscrupulous film magnate, Cameron Cole. Toby feels taking the job could be just the contact he needs to break into the movie business.<br /><br />While Jamie lusts after Toby, Toby lusts after a series of boys, from a co-worker Donovon, to a whole cast of characters including Subway Boy, Loft Boy, Army Guy, and others. The fantasies of domestic bliss Toby conjures up as he sees a potential mate, is an endearing quality of the ever-hopeful young man. The reader hopes Toby can find true love, but first he has to get his life together and clean up his act. Will he succeed in business and in love?<br /><br />When I wasn't laughing out loud, I was grinning from ear to ear at Dolby's wit, humor, and candor. Even in the face of inner turmoil and catastrophic events, Toby maintains his sense of humor which gets him through sticky situations. Toby is portrayed warts and all, or more accurately, pimples and all. He is not always a very nice person, but he is likeable even though the reader can't help but notice his shallow, egotistical, juvenile side. Toby makes mistakes but at least he has a conscience making him all the more human and believable. Hopefully, Toby can be saved from being the Trouble Boy and from making poor choices.<br /><br />Dolby intimately tells Toby's story in the first person, except when he switches to the third person in chapter three as Toby has a flashback of his freshman year at college. What at first seemed jarring proved to be a well thought out tactic that emphasizes Toby's feelings that \\"it happened to another person, another Toby Griffin.\\" [p. 40]. Who hasn't felt, or wished, that certain life events had happened to someone else?<br /><br />With the gay Mecca Upper East Side of Manhattan lingo perfected in Tom Dolby's debut novel, \\"The Trouble Boy,\\" it's hard to imagine not being there along with the characters. Vivid descriptions, catchy phrases, irresistible jargon all add to the charm of this fast-paced gay boy romp. \\"The Trouble Boy\\" is reminiscent of William J. Mann's \\"The Men from the Boys\\" in that Toby is like so many gay boys-he's desperate not to end up living alone. He goes from one anonymous sexual encounter to another searching for love and a permanent relationship, most of the time for the wrong reasons and in the wrong places. Dolby's insightful observations are wonderful. One example is when Toby admits, \\"Unlike those who had discovered a loss of libido on antidepressants, my libido was as strong as ever, which made the situation worse. I felt like an injured athlete who could only cheer his team on from the sidelines.\\" [p. 37]. The metaphor was great as Toby describes the sexual side effects of Paxil.<br /><br />While \\"The Trouble Boy\\" is classified as gay fiction, straight readers will be able to relate to Toby's dreams and aspirations quite well. This fun but troubling journey into the gay world should not be bound by genre. \\"The Trouble Boy\\" is engrossing, believable, and funny. The dialogue rings true, and the pace is quick. It could easily be turned into a screenplay and major motion picture. I give \\"The Trouble Boy\\" five stars and look forward to the sequel.Trouble Boy\\" is reminiscent of William J.

Elmore's \\"Imperceptible DANGER,\\" we meet world-renowned photographer Tristin Dobbs who thinks nothing of taking risks in her professional life; she even photographs sharks at close range. The thirty-three year old is adept at surviving in the wild and taking on dangerous assignments to further her career, but when it comes to matters of the heart, Tristin is much more cautious. She is attractive to both men and women and according to those who know her; she could have her pick of dates. If that's true, then why is she single?<br /><br />Tristin's sister Lauren is the owner of the \\"Wilderness Escape,\\" which sponsor organized guided camping trips. Out of the goodness of her heart, Tristin agrees to go on the fourteen-day excursion to take professional photographs for Lauren's next brochure. She could think of better ways to spend her vacation than with a bunch of city girls \\"who think spending a couple weeks in the woods is going to miraculously change their lives forever...\\" (p. 2-3) until she meets the lovely lawyer Danielle Eason.<br /><br />Danielle is breathtaking, \\"...her eyes sparkling with unparalleled beauty.\\" (p. 11) A novice camper with perhaps other things on her mind than back packing, Danielle has brought a suitcase along for a hiking adventure. Tristin, the more experienced camper, decides to help Danielle and is immediately taken with the girl's radiance. She allows Danielle to share her backpack and sleeping bag. They become instant friends and partners for the remainder of the trip. Tristin falls in love with the beautiful secretive stranger thus beginning a tempestuous affair.<br /><br />During the cookouts, camping, and hiking, Elmore introduces and develops each character using dialogue that is lively and believable. The setting is adequately described, \\"The rays of sunlight that managed to weave their way through the thick greenery created a kaleidoscope effect on the forest floor.\\" (p. 56), as the campers explore, get to know one another, and the reader learns about them. The lead tour guide, Kate Kirkland, an earth mother type, acts as a mentor and protector of all the girls, especially, Tristin. It is fun meeting all the girls and sharing their adventure. All is well until accidents begin to happen and Tristin suspects someone is sabotaging their campsite-but who is doing it and why?<br /><br />D. C. Elmore throws in lots of plot twists to keep you guessing along with humor, drama, and sex to keep you engrossed in this romance/action/adventure novel. I laughed out loud when, \\"[Tristin] had managed to alleviate the puffiness earlier in the morning thanks to the twenty-minute treatment of a makeshift ice pack using ice cubes, a washcloth, and duct tape.\\"(p. 2) Whoever heard of using duct tape as part of a beauty regimen?

Common Sons is the first novel in the remarkable Common Threads in the Life series by accomplished author Ronald L. Donaghe. It takes place on the Reece farm in the middle of a New Mexican desert, near the Florida Mountains in a small town called Common. Joel Reece is a courageous seventeen year old who is not afraid to fight for what he believes. Joel discovers the name for what he is and learns first hand about hatred and discrimination. Homosexuality was believed to be \\"a neurotic distortion of the total personality...\\" by ignorant psychiatrists at that time. Rather than deny his true nature and try to make it disappear, the admirable young man stands proud in 1965 when the social climate for gays was far less tolerant.<br /><br />Joel, far from being neurotic and certainly not fitting any of the stereotypical characteristics of the \\"gay\\" male, is a farmer's son aspiring to follow in his father's footsteps. He falls in love with Tom Allen, a preacher's boy, after the unlikely pair became close friends and share an unplanned public kiss. Rumors that Joel and Tom are queer begin to destroy the boys' reputations.<br /><br />All we know about Joel at the beginning of Common Sons is, \\"Joel woke up disturbed.\\" Donaghe captures the reader's attention immediately with the four-word paragraph, and holds the reader's interest for 376 pages. It doesn't take long to find out what makes Joel tick. The calm and steadfast young man is not only smart beyond his years, but he knows exactly what he wants; he wants Tom in his life-forever.<br /><br />Tom, a year ahead of Joel in school, has just graduated. His father has already picked out a college for him to attend, since the strict preacher doesn't allow his son to participate in any decision making-not even concerning his own future. Tom and Joel meet after Mr. Allen takes the job as preacher for the fundamentalist Church of Christ in Common. Tom, believing in his church's teachings, lives in fear of his father's wrath. Tom is aware of his homosexuality. \\"...drumming in his head were passages from the Bible he knew by heart,\\" \\"\\"Sins of the flesh,\\" \\"reprobate mind,\\" \\"unnatural lusts.\\"\\" He fights long and hard to change, but after he meets and falls in love with Joel, he begins to question his father, the Bible, and his own self-loathing. Joel teaches him the true meaning of love, self-respect, and friendship.<br /><br />Once the boys decide that they want to be together, they have to fight Mr. and Mrs. Allen, who cannot accept Tom's homosexuality. They refuse to have any further dealings with him unless he repents for his \\"hideous\\" sins. Luckily, Joel's parents are nothing like Tom's parents. Even though the Reeces are not that happy about the situation, they have an open mind and wouldn't consider disowning their son.<br /><br />Douglas Reece, Joel's father, is one of my favorite characters. He is a strong man with high standards, morals, and through his fine example, he teaches Joel to respect himself. Douglas does not allow the church's unyielding doctrines to guide his beliefs. One memorable lesson that Douglas teaches Joel is, \\"Never show disrespect to people, son, and you won't do anything to be ashamed of. If you want something from somebody, and they aren't willing to part with it, that's their decision and your tough luck.\\" Douglas is respected in his community and does not allow prejudice to stand in the way of how he feels about his son. Unlike the Allens, the Reeces hold their heads high in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Joel and Tom are also up against Kenneth Stroud (notice how his name rhymes with shroud) the town's bad boy who has had it in for Joel since they were kids. Kenneth comes from a poor family with an alcoholic, wife-beating father, who feels the world ought to pay for his bad luck. He and another villain, Paul Romaine, one of the church's disciples, set out to publicly humiliate and destroy Joel and Tom.<br /><br />Ronald L. Donaghe develops his characters sowell that you either want to be Joel or you<br /><br />want to meet him. Joel and Tom are excellent role models of a committed, faithful, and loving couple who should be envied, not despised. What I love most about Common Sons, and the sequels The Blind Season and The Salvation Mongers, is the author's ability to get inside the characters' heads so completely. Donaghe even humanizes the villains, which makes their evil deeds all the more horrible. Along with character development, picturesque descriptions of the New Mexican landscape, and depictions of the rampant homophobia that existed at the time, Donaghe also manages to teach many lessons of tolerance. Common Sons is a wonderful journey of two boys' lives, and the reader feels privileged to share it with them. Donaghe's style, honesty, and wit make his books, both fiction and non-fiction, very hard to put down.

US	29645443	R2X6IG34C23OJG	0595304907	569495167	Bought and Paid For: A Jan Phillips Novel	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Review of Bought and Paid For by Cheri	Bought and Paid For by Michael Halfhill is about a boy on the cusp of his eighteenth birthday. Jan Phillips has recently completed high school at Saint Dominic's Academy under the tutelage of Father Sobinski, and his impoverished mother wants him to get a job. Joy Phillips has six mouths to feed and feels it's time her eldest son pulls his own weight. Having been given an ultimatum, Jan goes out in search of work, but comes up empty handed.<br /><br />Jan first hears about the \\"Tenderloin District\\" in Philadelphia from a friend who confides in him that he goes there and makes money by having sex with old men. Having been sheltered by his mother and Father Sobinski his whole life, Jan is repulsed when his friend suggests that with his good looks he could make a fortune.<br /><br />With his mentor Father Sobinski relocated to Rome, and his mother kicking him out of the nest, Jan sees no alternative than to try to make money the way his friend suggested. Jan sets off in search of work. He leaves his row house in Kensington, and takes the bus to the \\"Mary-Go-Round\\" in Center City where sex can be bought.<br /><br />The extremely wealthy, handsome, and charismatic Tim Morris, notices and takes an interest in the beautiful blond boy, who he dubs Goldilocks. Tim keeps an eye on Jan from his penthouse window, which conveniently overlooks the Tenderloin District. Tim notices that Jan hasn't made any money so decides to meet the boy.<br /><br />After listening to Jan's story and impressing the poor boy with his wealth, Tim makes him a business proposition. \\"Your mother needs money and she has you, I have money and I want you. It would be a simple exchange.\\" Should Jan try to convince his mother to sell him, her own son? Jan is not yet aware of his own sexuality, having lived his life in a social-sexual vacuum. \\"Jan has been taught all his life that...he would be damned for being queer.\\"<br /><br />Bought and Paid For is multi-dimensional fiction at its best. There is the romantic layer that details the love that develops between Jan, who falls in love with his moody mentor Tim. Jan is a complex character who is not just another pretty boy--he's smart too. As the story unfolds, you learn why Tim behaves the way he does and why he finds love and intimacy so scary.<br /><br />A truly wonderful character is Mrs. Santos, Tim's trustworthy housekeeper, confidant, and friend. She does more than cook delectable meals and run the household, she has a wisdom that gets Tim though his emotional rough spots. Mrs. Santos becomes a surrogate mother to Jan once he moves in with Tim.<br /><br />Another layer deals with the espionage aspect of the story as the characters find themselves in sticky and dangerous situations. The reader discovers that Tim is grooming Jan for clandestine international activities of the Mundus Society-but for what purpose? You have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Michael Halfhill is a talented storyteller. In Bought and Paid For, using third person narration, Halfhill captures the reader from the minute the first word is read. The intriguing, suspenseful, and sometimes disturbing story of Jan Phillips and Tim Morris goes way beyond an older man falling for a much younger, impressionable boy. Finding out what Tim really wants from Jan is part of what keeps the reader engrossed in the story. The other part is living vicariously through Jan as Tim teaches him about a world he has only read about in books.<br /><br />Aside from any moral judgments about this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it and was enamored with Jan and Tim. Some may be offended by the age difference and circumstances leading to Tim's capture of Jan's heart, but others might see the relationship as that of two consenting adults who fall in love. Halfhill makes us root for the characters despite what's deemed morally unacceptable. Bought and Paid For has everything from romance, love, sex, religion, politics, prostitution, family, society, and morality issuesto international intrigue. I give my highest praise and five stars plus for the first effort by Michael Halfhill. I eagerly await the sequel Scimitar., and morality issues to international intrigue.

Once the headstrong woman is resigned to the fact that she has no choice but to be the next Agent in Charge of protecting the safety of an equally strong-willed woman, who happens to be the daughter of the President of the United States, Commander Cameron Roberts is willing to put her life on the line for those in her care and lets nothing stand in her way in Above All, Honor by Radclyffe.<br /><br />Cameron Roberts thinks she's getting an easy job until she meets the stunning, willful, elusive, caged bird, Blair Allison Powell. Cameron's predecessor tells her that, \\"She's an angry animal in a cage, and you're the new zookeeper.\\" He also informs Cam that the \\"high-profile subject\\" has a \\"problematic lifestyle.\\" Blair's mission is to elude those who are hired to protect her in order to maintain some sense of freedom. Cameron's mission is to protect her while maintaining her privacy-if possible.<br /><br />The USSS Agent in charge before Cam steps in and gives the President's daughter an apropos code name: Egret. According to the New Merriam-Webster Dictionary, an Egret is \\"any of various herons that bear long plumes during the breeding season.\\" Blair barhops from one seedy place to another and most of the time she goes unnoticed. Who would expect the respectable first daughter to be frequenting bohemian gay bars? When on official White House business, Blair is quite the fancy diplomat. She rightfully yearns for a private life, which is virtually impossible, and until Cam Roberts comes along, nobody has any sympathy for her. She is not only trying to escape her life in a birdcage, but she has some painful memories of the past that have her haunted as well.<br /><br />Cam demands respect from those under her command and she gets it. She's shrewd, smart, has integrity, and strong work ethics-all of which result in glowing performance records. She has sharp gut instincts, amazing self-control, and is an expert at undercover work. Cam does not tolerate homophobia on her team. More to her credit, she has no qualms accepting the resignation of any officer who has a problem with the fact that Blair is gay. Cameron Roberts is an admirable hero worth emulating.<br /><br />Radclyffe's reference to \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" did not escape notice when Cam's report from her last assignment held all of her merits and facts without any of the story behind it. They noted the fact that her female partner was killed in action during the last sting, but it was not up for discussion that the partner had also been Cam's lover. Even though there were rumors that Cam was gay, they didn't ask and she didn't tell.<br /><br />Cam works hard to ignore Blair's advances. While Blair tries hard not to allow Cam to get under her skin. Is it possible for Cam and Blair to find love? According to Radclyffe, the essence of the entire Honor series is \\"the conflict between private and public lives, the balance between duty and love, and the incredible power of passion between strong-willed but sensitive people.\\"<br /><br />Above All, Honor is the first in the series of Honor books. After reading Above All, Honor, there is no doubt in my mind that I must read all of the sequels: Honor Bound, Love and Honor, and Honor Guards. I found Above All, Honor to be extremely fast reading, exciting, titillating, and realistic-especially the technically correct medical scene that one would expect from a surgeon. She equally and adeptly captures the essence of the secret service/police drama in her finely researched work. Radclyffe is a very talented, prolific, award-winning author who creates a believable and interesting story that will make you happy to become a \\"part ofthe team.\\"<br /><br />One of the things I like best about Radclyffe's writing is that even though she creates sexual tension and longing between the two main characters, at least she gives us tidbits-juicy ones I might add-along the way to quench our desire. The build-up is beautifully done and quite delightfully explicit, as is the climatic ending. A truly satisfying experience for all.<br /><br />I couldn't praise or rave about Above All, Honor any more than I am. It is a five plus star action/adventure/love story that will leave you breathless and hungry for more.<br /><br />[...]bout Radclyffe's writing is that even though she creates sexual tension and longing between the two main characters, at least she gives us tidbits-juicy ones I might add-along the way to quench our desire.

The two dads are not without a support system, what with Tom's mom, Donna, Taylor's best friend, Gen, Wayne, and other assorted friends who are more like family-Tom and Taylor have plenty of help with child rearing. Like a neo-Rockwell, Barriger paints a portrait of the perfect American family-even if there are two fathers, rather than a mother and a father.<br /><br />Two years after \\"Finding Peace,\\" Taylor's law practice is booming. He has passed the Mayor's torch to Gen in order to have more time for his family. Everything is comfy-cozy at the McEwan-Connolly household...which naturally means Tom wants to add more tumult to the mix when the opportunity presents itself to expand the business. All hell brakes loose when Stuart DiNardo, a local real estate developer, wants to usurp Gen from her position as Mayor in order to further his financial position. What would have been a quiet summer for Tom and Taylor turns into chaos. Will they be able to beat DiNardo and keep him from ruining their quaint hometown? Will Gen remain Mayor and stop the money-grubbing monster from overbuilding Pine Creek for his own profit? How will Tom and Taylor manage their increasingly hectic lives?<br /><br />Find out the answers to these questions and more when you read Finding Hope. Once again, Barriger delights his readers with crisp, clear, and catchy dialogue. He captures his audience with humor, drama, and romance as he weaves an endearing tale with twists and turns, and plenty of surprises.<br /><br />While it is not essential to read \\"Finding Faith\\" and \\"Finding Peace\\" before embarking on \\"Finding Hope,\\" I highly recommend it for full enjoyment. \\"Finding Hope\\" is a winner as it continues to follow the lives of favorite characters Tom, Taylor, Wayne, Eric, and Gen, on their journey through life.

The setting is Northeast Valley College, a small liberal arts college in New England.<br /><br />Andi is a serious, studious, shy, and cautious second year graduate assistant for the English Department. She has had her heart badly broken in the past so she's very reluctant to repeat history. CJ is the modest captain and star basketball player who's quite the celebrity, and is frequently written up in the school's paper. She's outgoing, fun loving, and willing to take risks both on the court and in life. She has a voracious appetite for life...and food, but she's not just another \\"dumb jock.\\" A history major, CJ has a lot on her plate, including finishing her senior course load, basketball championships, and deciding what to do with her future. She gives one hundred percent to everything she does from winning a basketball game to winning the love of her life. Opposites attract as graduate assistant and student meet by chance at a mandatory donor reception for the college. Sparks fly.<br /><br />Andi offers CJ help on a research project she is having trouble with, and CJ takes the English teacher up on her offer. She visits Andi during her office hours, which marks the beginning of a possible relationship. The women clearly enjoy each other's company and quickly develop a deep friendship and affection for one another. Are they destined to be lovers or just friends? Andi ponders the dilemma of CJ being a student, even though she isn't her student. She also doesn't want to risk getting hurt again. What if the object of Andi's desire is within her reach, but she is too afraid to risk her heart? What if CJ's \\"the one,\\" but Andi has so much at stake, both professionally and personally, that it almost paralyzes her?

Catherine, a truly extraordinary woman and purveyor of herbs, spices, and fine linens, is a well-known and respected member of the Spice Vendor's Guild.

Catherine and Lydia are aware of their love for each other, but both are too afraid to reveal their hearts' desire.

Moore's debut novel, \\"Dancing in the Arms of Orion.\\" He has more to deal with than just deciding what he is going to do in the future-he also has to acclimate to a new school, make new friends, and come to terms with being gay. We meet him during the summer his family plans to move to Whaler's Cove in the historic Towne of Ulm.<br /><br />At first, Daniel is apprehensive about the move, but his newfound friends and possible love interests quickly alleviates that feeling. Ever the optimist, Daniel makes the best of every situation and even likes his new school. He particularly likes Whaler's Cove when he spots the boy of his dreams-a lifeguard at the town pool-and discovers they are neighbors.<br /><br />Daniel's senior year turns out to be chockfull of highs and lows, first times, and new experiences as Daniel comes to terms with being gay, helps friends in need, and matures into a fine young man. He forms a fast and lasting friendship with his neighbor, Cristal, and the two help each other through tough situations. They are both way more mature than their years. All of Moore's characters are noteworthy and add to the story about a group of friends who manage to make it through unscathed on their way to adulthood.<br /><br />Moore writes a charming coming of age novel about a wonderful boy any mother would love to call her son. He not only gets along well with his parents and adorable younger sister Melissa, but he even cleans his own room and does his own laundry. He is a mother's dream come true. Daniel also has a terrific relationship with his father that he cherishes. He is wise enough to know he risks destroying what they have if his father cannot accept that he's gay.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Dancing in the Arms of Orion\\" to impressionable teenagers because I think it deals with prevalent gay/straight teen issues realistically, honestly, and offers sound advice and solutions. Parents of teenagers would benefit from it as they deal with raising their children in today's world. Adults who enjoy reliving their youth through reading will enjoy this book too. This book offers something for everyone. Moore successfully tells Daniel's story in the first person and ends up making the reader feel that much closer to him. Daniel is a person anyone would be happy to call a friend. This entertaining story of love, family, and friendship is uplifting.

According to Lake, \\"the experiences are not just lesbian-related, though they certainly are lesbian-themed. Anyone who has had any sort of mother/daughter relationship will surely feel for so many of the characters. Lots of angst, regret, and grief in the book - but also some unexpected humor. It was an interesting thing to put together.\\" I agree with Lake and I can tell what a labor of love this project was for her. Her time and effort paid off in producing a well-written, insightful collection of literature.<br /><br />Everyone craves unconditional love and acceptance by the person who nurtured them- regardless of sexual orientation. The anthology encompasses thoughts of daughters and mothers; it spans a few generations to give different points of view. Katherine V. Forrest asks, \\"Does the need for a mother ever leave?\\" Perhaps not. Forrest continues, \\"Among women, our deeper friendships contain, along with love and warmth, elements of nurturing, protectiveness, guiding, mentorship, and wound-binding.\\" Women need each other on many different levels, and the fortunate ones have at least one woman in their lives-be it their mother, lover, or friend-who fulfills this need. \\"The Milk of Human Kindness\\" depicts many aspects of the human condition.<br /><br />Lori L. Lake's fiction, \\"The Bright Side,\\" shows how a mother's criticisms can deeply affect her daughter. In this story we see a mother who is so critical of her daughter she compliments her on her weight loss even though it is due to chemotherapy for breast cancer! In addition, she is disappointed that her daughter is gay and throws it in her daughter's face-even during a family crisis. This is not to say that we don't love our critical mothers, but our mothers' unfavorable comments often hurt the worst.<br /><br />In \\"Train Tracks,\\" fiction by Cameron Abbott, a simple question between sisters discussing their ailing, possibly dying mother, \\"Has she asked for me?\\" evokes emotions of a daughter who against all odds still yearns for unconditional love by a mother who never accepted her.<br /><br />\\"The Tuesday Before Thanksgiving,\\" fiction by Georgia Beers, is about a mother with preconceived notions and prejudice regarding her daughter's sexuality. By the time she accepts her, she reads in the paper, \\"President Bush says \\"No\\" to gay unions,\\" and her heart aches for her daughter. Her tune changes from, \\"My daughter is a lesbian,\\" to, \\"My daughter is happy.\\"<br /><br />The memoir by Carrie Carr, \\"Hiding in Plain Sight\\" is about one woman's journey from self-hatred and despair to self-love and happiness. Carr shares a hard-earned and important revelation when she writes, \\"Sometimes, the only person you are hiding from is yourself,\\" when she was sure that coming out would ruin her life. She was fortunate to gain the love and support of her family and find a loving partner. She learned a very valuable lesson and by sharing her story, she taught a lesson as well.<br /><br />Karin Kallmaker's witty and insightful memoir, \\"Dangling Earrings,\\" tells how her mother taught her the importance of what others think. Nice girls don't wear flashy earrings. She in turn wants to teach her children  \\"...how they feel about themselves, on the inside, is more important than the opinions of strangers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grandmother's Cup,\\" fiction by Lois Cloarec Hart, shows how a mother/daughter's love is as irreplaceable as an antique cup. It is precious and should be cherished.<br /><br />\\"Mother Memoir: A Coming Out Story\\" by Ellen Hart is heart-warming. Hart writes, \\"I understand now that love was the bridge over which we met and talked, and finally, where we healed the wounds of our differences.\\" Brilliantly put.<br /><br />Jean Stewart writes a memoir titled, \\"World Without End,\\" that you won't soon forget. \\"World Without End\\" tells about painful memories of child abuse by her father and how her mother stood by silently and didn't intervene. Stewart writes, \\"I became the sacrifice my mother made to my father's anger.\\" Stewart's father could not accept his daughter and while her mother could, she would not jeopardize her marriage to save her daughter from her father's wrath. Stewart gets past the physical and psychological pain she endured from her parents by finding love in her life. She writes, \\"Finding love does that; it gives you the strength and good will to reach out and reconnect, even with people who have hurt you.\\"<br /><br />Radclyffe shows how \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" can be as damaging as disclosing the truth. She ends up with an even stronger relationship with her mother because her mother asked-and she told. It touched me when her mother confronted her about being a lesbian and she answered truthfully, thereby creating an even stronger bond with her mother. \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell or...The Day My Mother Broke the Silence\\" is an inspiring memoir/essay by Radclyffe.<br /><br />Lake has stated, \\"When it comes right down to it, sexuality may be fluid, but the themes of life that all human beings must deal with are universal. I mean, really--it's a failure of imagination for people not to \\"get\\" the full range of human sexuality! And to my way of thinking, it's not SEX that matters, it's the relationships.\\" Therefore, why shouldn't mothers, fathers, and ultimately society, accept their daughters?<br /><br />\\"The Milk of Human Kindness\\" is about the most important relationship of all-our first real relationship that means the difference between life and death-the relationship we have with our mothers. Each author has added her own personal touch and writing style. It was enlightening and enjoyable to read each story as a separate entity and be able to relate to them all. I strongly feel that \\"The Milk of Human Kindness\\" should be included on the syllabus of every Human Sexuality and Women in Literature course; it should be required reading along with Betty Freidan and Simone de Beavoir. You will be tempted to check out the other works of each author after reading their stories. The Contributor Bibliography at the back of the book offers an easy reference for the authors' published works. Don't miss this five plus star collection. Lake has entertained the thought of putting together an anthology of stories written by lesbian authors about their relationships with their fathers. I hope it comes to fruition. I commend and thank each and every contributor, and wish I could cite every line written that affected me in some way, but I would have to write a book to include all of my thoughts.

US	29645443	R2I7EJMBQ52Y5U	1930928432	957788757	Gun Shy	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Review of Gun Shy by Cheri	Officer Desiree \\"Dez\\" Reilly is a veteran cop extraordinaire with the St. Paul Police Department in Lori L. Lake's police action/drama Gun Shy. This reticent Amazon beauty with long black hair, smooth ivory skin, electric blue eyes, and a muscular build is an adept daredevil at police work, but she is extremely cautious (gun shy) when it comes to matters of the heart. While Dez is on the job, she rescues and meets a \\"whirling bundle of energy,\\" Jaylynn \\"Jay\\" Savage, a sharp pre-law student. Jaylynn could not be more different from Dez in stature, appearance, and personality. Jay is a talkative, vivacious, shorthaired, curvaceous blonde, who wears her heart on her sleeve. Dez is in complete control of her emotions...most of the time. Jaylynn falls in love with the tall, mysterious cop, her \\"hero,\\" at first sight.<br /><br />Carefully guarding her emotions, Dez is very careful whom she trusts. Estranged from her mother, her father gone, her mentor avoiding her since he found out she was gay, and feeling like a loser at love, she keeps her distance from others to protect herself from any further pain and sorrow. She has also been living with a thick black cloud over her head because of a shooting that left her partner and close friend, Ryan Michaelson, a married father of two young children, dead. Dez deals with his death the only way she knows how-by shutting down her emotions and refusing psychological treatment. The department can make her see a shrink, but they can't make her accept help.<br /><br />After assisting an officer apprehend the men who broke into her house, witnessing police work first hand, and meeting the woman of her dreams, Jaylynn decides to apply for the Police Academy rather than apply to law school as planned. She feels she can always go back to it after she sees what police work is all about. The rookie excels at the academy and lands a rotation with the veteran cop, who actually requests to be Jaylynn's Field Training Officer.  The two women ride together as teacher/student and work extremely well together. They form a friendship in the process, but much to Dez's chagrin, Jaylynn wants more than a working relationship. Jay feels that she has finally found her soul mate even though Dez can be a moody, tough nut to crack. Meanwhile, Dez, scared to death of commitment, pushes the rookie away. Everyone who knows the two, from Luella Williams, Dez's landlady, cook, uniform washer, and surrogate mother, to Jaylynn's best friend and housemate, Sara, can tell there is electricity in the air between the two cops.<br /><br />Gun Shy is an exciting look at police work through the eyes of police officers who also happen to be lesbians. Lori L. Lake has set a fine precedent with her endearing, witty, action packed story that has plenty of police activity, longing, and romance. It brings to mind one of my favorite TV shows, Cagney and Lacey, a classic 1980's hit about two straight female cops. Gun Shy would be a great model for a contemporary version-two female officers, Reilly and Savage, who not only fight crime, but also have the hots for each other. It would be a big hit too.<br /><br />Before reading Gun Shy, Ricochet in Time was my favorite book by Lori L. Lake. Her heroines are real, believable, and interesting. What I like most about Lake's writing is that I identify with the characters, even though I lead a different lifestyle. She uses phrases and expressions that I use in daily life. Curling up in bed with a Lake novel is like pulling an all-nighter...laughing, sharing, and gabbing with an old friend. Lake has a way of making the reader fall in love with her characters and really care about them. The reader longs for Dez and Jay to become lovers.  I also like how Lake uses the contrary features of her characters to emphasize a point. For example, the dichotomy of Dez: she has white skin and black hair; she is a lion on the outside, and a lamb on the inside; she often comes across as cold hearted on the outside, but she's a warm toasty marshmallow on the inside. Dez is the epitome of the tough cop when she informs Jaylynn that cops don't cry. Jaylynn teaches her that sometimes cops need to cry in order to heal, and that it's ok.<br /><br />Luella is another great character who is funny, sassy, and provides Dez with more than an affordable place to live-she looks out for her, and treats her like a daughter. She can also whip up a complete hot meal in twenty minutes. Luella is Lake's idea of a \\"fantasy woman-my own personal chef.\\"  If I had a landlady, I'd want her to be just like Luella. Dez reciprocates by doing yard work and repairs around the house, but more ironically, by allowing the older woman to boss her around, when it seems that Dez only takes orders from senior officers. Dez keeps her heart under lock and key, but not with Luella. You can't help but love the reserved cop, especially when you're privy to her vulnerable side. I'm straight and I fell in love with Dez, so I can certainly understand why Jaylynn feels the way she does. Will Dez unlock her heart for Jay? You'll have to read this book to find out.<br /><br />To say that I enjoyed Gun Shy is an understatement; I loved it. Lori Lake has repeatedly proven herself a noteworthy writer, who I feel will soon find herself in the mainstream market. Currently, she is working on a third book in the Gun series, Have Gun We'll Travel, plus a series of non-gay themed mystery novels. Under the Gun is the sequel to Gun Shy, and I recommend not missing either selection. With an unlimited supply of ideas for novels floating around in her head, Lake's fans will have plenty to read for years to come.rted on the outside, but she's a warm toasty marshmallow on the inside.

US	29645443	R1HRPM0WLE2PDT	0595298060	317116219	The Summer of My Discontent: A Better Place II	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Review of The Summer of My Discontent by Cheri	For those readers who are keeping up with the Gay Youth Chronicles, we're back in Verona, Indiana, in the summer of 1981. All living together on the Selby Farm are our old friends Ethan, Nathan, Brendan, Casper, Ethan's Uncle Jack, and Jack's second wife, Ardelene, who happens to be Casper's grandma. The Summer of My Discontent is the much-awaited sequel to Mark A. Roeder's, A Better Place.<br /><br />We meet a few new characters, including Dane, a troubled runaway looking for love and sex in all the wrong places. He chooses friends unwisely, and makes some bad choices while trying to find his place in the world. Dane takes up company and moves in with a male prostitute, Austin, then ends up working for a grave robber, Boothe, in order to put food in his stomach. He thinks his new life is better than living at home with his parents, and having them find out his big, dark secret. Dane fantasizes about having a real boyfriend, someone to love who will return his love, but he wants to have sex so is willing to go to any measure to get it. The problem is that he chooses the wrong boys to mess with. Dane is only sixteen years old and has a lot of growing up to do. Can he do that on his own in Verona?<br /><br />Ethan and Nathan are as in love as ever and they help Uncle Jack on the farm. Each boy is thankful for the other, and for all they have together. Boyfriends, Brendan and Casper, feel fortunate for having stumbled upon the Selby farm. They leave their hometown, Kentucky, and land jobs on the farm. As a result they become a part of a loving \\"family.\\" Life is good until a drought hits the farm, threatening its economic stability. The family draws closer together as they try to figure out a way to avoid financial ruin.<br /><br />Ethan is willing to forgo his hopes and dreams of being Verona High's champion wrestler in order to help Uncle Jack farm the land. Brendan longs to be the new Verona High quarterback-a position he was very proud of in his old high school, before he was outed. In A Better Place, Brendan had been sent to the Cloverdale Center, a place designed to convert gay youths and make them straight. It is also a place for juvenile delinquents, which is ironic since Brendan was a good student, an incredible athlete, and a good person. His only \\"crime\\" was being gay, and his parents simply could not accept that fact. He escapes that horrific place, and takes Casper with him to seek a better place. Casper must escape because of his neglectful father and abusive brother. Brendan and Casper run for their lives, and, as luck would have it, they are given a second chance at happiness. In The Summer of My Discontent, Brendan is so thankful to be away from Cloverdale and his parents, he is willing to forgo his beloved football in order to help save the farm and secure his new home. With the four boys pulling together, along with Uncle Jack, they hope to save what is near and dear to them. Nathan and Casper get jobs outside the home to bring in a little extra cash, while Ethan and Brendan work the farm. Meanwhile, Casper's brother, Jason, is at the Cloverdale Center, serving time for killing their father, and trying to kill Casper, too. He writes Casper and tries to make amends for his past misdeeds. Is he redeemable, or is he just trying to manipulate Casper all over again?<br /><br />Ethan's best friends, Jon and Brandon, lend a hand before the new school term begins. Ethan and Nathan make no secret about their relationship, but Brendan and Casper are not out about theirs. It's not that they want to hide who they are, but they are starting at a new school, and have yet to feel their way around. At Verona High, Brendan will have to prove himself as a jock all over again. Casper was shy and introverted at his old school...now he has a second chance to make friends. It should be an interesting, if not exciting year for all the boys, especially when Uncle Jack insists that Ethan and Brendan not give up sports to work the farm.Both boys couldn't be happier...even though it means school and practice all day, and then coming home to farm work and homework. They don't even mind working weekends.<br /><br />Mark Roeder once again tells a riveting tale with our favorite heroes, along with some new villains. The Gay Youth Chronicles could easily be TV's next Dawson's Creek. I can absolutely see Roeder's series of books as a hit TV series that would delight, entertain, and teach a few lessons along the way. We need more gay youth oriented TV programming so gay kids don't have to feel like they are alone in the world, and straight kids might learn to be more tolerant. The Summer of My Discontent is fast-paced and fun. It appeals to all audiences and tells a great story. Mark Roeder never ceases to amaze me. He offers advice and hope for troubled youth who are having difficulties dealing with discrimination, fear, raging hormones, and insecurity. There is a common theme in Roeder's Gay Youth Chronicles. He offers hope that someday a world where being gay is not only accepted by society, but that being gay is not a big deal. He also shows that acceptance of being gay is the way to enjoy life to the fullest and achieve true happiness. Another common theme is that when love and friendship precede sex, intimacy will be much more meaningful and satisfying. Roeder does more than tell interesting stories; he teaches lessons in morality as his characters-his heroes-are honest, loving people who care about one another, and help those less fortunate. Ethan, Brendan, Nathan, and Casper are fine upstanding young men worth emulating.  Dane, Jason, Austin, and Boothe are deviant characters that could either show redemption or suffer the consequences of their unacceptable behavior. Learning from one's mistakes, and not repeating them, is what life is all about. I give The Summer of My Discontent five stars. Whenever I pick up a book by Mark A. Roeder, I know I am in for a great time.he farm. Both boys couldn't be happier...even though it means school and practice all day, and then coming home to farm work and homework.

US	29645443	R2XC3SZHJBWV0E	0671027212	725696403	Frontiers	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Review of Frontiers by Cheri	Frontiers, by Michael Jensen, is an historical novel filled with adventure, suspense, steamy sex, beautifully described scenery, note-worthy characters to both love and hate...all woven together to tell a rich and interesting story. A riveting tale, Frontiers is told in the first person through the eyes of John Chapman, a young man with a strong sense of moral values, an endearing love of animals, and, despite all the hardships he has endured, compassion for his fellow man.<br /><br />Using colorful language, Jensen paints a realistic picture of how difficult life was in the late 1700's for a sensitive young gay man, who has had so much grief and tumult in his life, that he wants nothing more than to settle down. Barely escaping death, Chapman runs for his life. He escapes the men who killed his lover; there was zero tolerance for \\"sodomites\\" in 1797. In his haste to avoid being killed or flogged, Chapman escapes without money, supplies, or a horse. Starving, and near frozen to death, he is rescued by Daniel McQuay, who offers him food and shelter, but not necessarily out of the goodness of his heart. Chapman manages to survive the long, cold winter, sharing a cabin with McQuay, but he senses something is not kosher with this moody, alcoholic man. As soon as he's able to escape, Chapman is on the run again.<br /><br />History repeats itself. He is rescued from starvation and death, this time by a kind Indian woman, Gwennie. She deposits him in a new settlement, Franklin. Being welcomed into this new settlement represents a brand new beginning for Chapman.<br /><br />Frontiers takes place at a time when settlers were stealing land, left and right, from Native Americans. John feels compassion for the \\"Indians,\\" and feels the other settlers wouldn't be any happier knowing he preferred men, sexually, than they would if they knew he had an Indian friend. He is indebted to Gwennie for saving him and giving him a real chance at happiness, and hopefully, permanence in his life<br /><br />Jensen uses flashbacks of John's youth to recall events in his life. I thought this was an excellent touch. It allows the reader to understand John, and helps define his personality. We see why John becomes a wanderer-running away from problems instead of facing them head-on. John is tired of running; he just wants to settle down, be left alone and live his life as he sees fit. He is perfectly willing to give up personal relationships with men in order to avoid further trouble in his life.<br /><br />Then he meets Palmer, a young man who shows interest in something more than simple friendship. John cannot deny a strong attraction to Palmer, and once again attempts to escape from his natural instincts. Can he avoid temptation or will he give in to love and desire? You simply must read this book.<br /><br />What I liked best about Frontiers, was how it grabbed me, enticing me to keep reading...I could not put the book down. The sexual tension in the beginning, between John and Daniel, was only appeased by reading further into the story. Jensen relieved the pressure so eloquently and completely, that the first love scene was not just memorable, it was HOT! I was pleasantly surprised when there were more erotic scenes further along in the story. Frontiers had me on the edge of my seat on more than one occasion and I couldn't read quickly enough to get to the outcome.<br /><br />My only criticism, but I take it back now that I've finished the book, is that the first half of the book was peppered with so many metaphors and similes, that I actually started counting them. They're distracting, but by the second half of the book, I forgot all about them. Not that the similes weren't good; it made me wonder if that was the way people spoke in the 1700's, or if Jensen got carried away. (The author has since told me that more colorful language was used at the time the novel is set in.) Don't get me wrong about the first half, despite my mentioning the similes; Frontiers is incredible and exciting, with elements of fear, longing, hardship, and danger. The whole book is great, and if you like suspense and romance set in historic times, I cannot recommend enough that you should not miss this gem of a novel. I could easily see Frontiers as a new generation major motion picture, in the Gay/Western genre. Move over John Wayne-here comes John Chapman, Palmer, Gwennie and their story of how the west was won.my mentioning the similes; Frontiers is incredible and exciting, with elements of fear, longing, hardship, and danger.

US	29645443	R1VIFXBPJNY0WG	1932300171	760721217	Ricochet In Time	Books	5	9	13	N	N	I loved this book	Award winning, best-selling author, Lori L. Lake, tells a riveting story in her acclaimed novel, Ricochet in Time. Lake's novel hits a raw nerve in its depiction of prejudice, homophobia, and gay bashing at its ugliest. It is a story of how tragedy and despair can lead to hope and love as a brave woman, Dani, with the help of newfound friends, fights back. The main theme of Ricochet in Time is, \\"What goes around comes around...you send love out into the world, and it comes back to you. You send out hatred and hell-fire, and it behaves just like a boomerang. It ricochets right back and hits you in the heart (p. 198).\\" One door closes for Dani, will another one open?<br /><br />Danielle Corbett (Dani) and her new girlfriend, Margaret Lee O'Donnell (Meg), lives are changed forever because they stopped at a bar along the road. They had been traveling by motorcycle in hot, humid weather, and after two hours they needed a break; they stopped to get a Coke. If only they hadn't, things would have been so different. The mere sight of these women provoked the locals, who took offense at having two \\"queers\\" in their establishment. One bigoted low-life forces them to leave. He doesn't think \\"perverted dykes\\" have the right to be in his presence. Dani and Meg leave, but not without a fight. Thus, begins the masterful storytelling Lake is best known for.<br /><br />Left for dead by their basher, hikers witness the accident and rescue Dani. Hurt, alone, with little money, and no place to go, Dani's impulse is to run. She has always run away from her troubles. The only thing keeping her from running this time is her medical condition. Dani has to heal first-physically and mentally. She has to come to terms with Meg's death, figure out where she is going to live, and what she is going to do with her life. After her mother's death, Dani and her brother were raised by a homophobic, abusive, and alcoholic father. Growing up under harsh circumstances, she developed a tough outer shell, but inside she is a sensitive, caring woman who only wants to love and be loved.<br /><br />Hospitalized at a very vulnerable and lonely time in her life, Dani meets a physical therapist, Grace Beaumont, who is interested in Dani for reasons she doesn't reveal. Grace's great-aunts, Estelline, and her partner, Ruth, take Dani into their home and hearts. They feed her starving body, as well as her mind and soul. What started out as Ruth's desire to get the story of the bashing for The Purple Paper, and to help the gay community fight prejudice and hate crimes, ends up to be so much more. Dani becomes an important part of Grace, Estelline, and Ruth's lives. The women become very special to Dani too.<br /><br />The heart-warming, committed, and loving relationship between Estelline and Ruth sets a perfect example of two soul mates who remain together through thick and thin; they have weathered many storms and have become stronger because of it. The older women are role models for the younger women. Can Dani and Grace achieve what these two women have?<br /><br /> Ricochet in Time grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go. The story flows so naturally that you don't feel like you're reading a book. You are there, living through the circumstances along with the characters, who come to life on every page. Lori L. Lake is a masterful storyteller. What I love most about Lake's novels is how much I care about the characters and what happens to them. Even with Dani's rough-around-the-edges exterior, you can't help but love her. She comes across as a strong woman who can fend for herself against all odds, but this is her coping mechanism. Through Grace's eyes, you see the good more clearly and you find yourself rooting for more than friendship between Dani and Grace. Lake writes with such clarity and imagery that her description of the pain Dani suffers from the accident is palpable. The author, insightfully and eloquently, went inside her characters' heads, making the story that much more believable. You know exactly what and how the characters are feeling at any given time.<br /><br />I highly recommend Lake's debut novel, Ricochet in Time. This talented author of the best-selling novels, Stepping Out: Short Stories, Different Dress, Under the Gun, Gun Shy, and Ricochet in Time, is \\"considered one of the best authors of modern lesbian fiction,\\" according to Lavender Magazine, \\" but her work-part action, part drama, and part romance-gleefully defies categorization.\\" I couldn't agree more.' heads, making the story that much more believable.

How about marital bliss with a marriage license? If only it were available to Taylor and Tom; perhaps then, Taylor would have a proper word to assign to his relationship with Tom. Taylor goes through the usual terms of endearment, i.e., partner, lover, boyfriend, significant other, spouse, etc., but he longs to be legally bound to, and have a permanent title for, the man he loves. In Andrew Barriger's sequel to Finding Faith, we find Taylor and Tom setting up a home and life together in Finding Peace.<br /><br />For those who have read Finding Faith, which is not a pre-requisite to reading Finding Peace, you already know and love Taylor and Tom. For those who haven't read Barriger's first book, it won't take long to get to know these two extraordinary men, who met by chance, fell in love, and went through all sorts of trials and tribulations before ending up a loving, committed couple. Taylor, an attorney, relocated from the city, leaving behind a cheating ex-boyfriend, to live with his friend, Gen, in a small, quaint town. Moving led to greater happiness than he ever thought possible---he met Tom.<br /><br />In Finding Peace, Taylor has opened a law firm in town, and, he's still helping Tom at the bakery. Additionally, Taylor has become the town's first gay mayor, openly accepted by his constituents. Talk about needing a 48 hour day! Tom is teaching at a local High School, and still works at the bakery. He loves the bakery and has no intention of leaving: it is the place where he first laid eyes on Taylor. Tom and Taylor manage to have some quality time together, but unfortunately, not enough. As if their hectic lives aren't busy enough, events occur which put further demands on their leisure time together. Can a relationship withstand the stresses of careers and business, even though they possess a strong commitment?<br /><br />In Finding Peace, Barriger introduces us to many new and interesting characters we would be happy to call friends and family. Wayne is a troubled youth from a dysfunctional, abusive family who Tom hires to help at the bakery, allowing him more free time with Taylor. Taylor is skeptical at first, to entrust the care of the bakery to a gay young man with such a troubled past. Taylor worries about appearances. What would the townspeople think about two gay men hiring a gay teenager? Tom convinces Taylor to give Wayne a chance. They take Wayne under their wings and quickly become father figures to the high school senior. Wayne is a bright, sensitive young man who works hard and wants to make something of his life even though he was dealt a tough hand. What he finds with Taylor and Tom is more than just friendship-he finds the love and family he never knew.<br /><br />The plot unfolds as Taylor and Tom decide to invite both their families for the Thanksgiving holiday. The two sets of parents, who never met, have Taylor anxious with anticipation. Tom is much more laid back and tries to convince Taylor not to worry. Tom's sister, Mandy, asks if it's okay to invite her college friend, Eric, who has nowhere to spend the holiday. When Eric meets Wayne, sparks fly, and the plot thickens.<br /><br />Emmy is Wayne's school friend and co-worker at the bakery. Emmy and Wayne have a strong bond; she helps Wayne deal with the stormy relationship with his family. She's also there to help him come to terms with his sexuality. While Taylor and Tom are Wayne's father figures, Emmy is Wayne's peer.<br /><br />Bryce, Taylor's straight, married, younger brother, is another character worth noting. He adds a refreshing element to the novel with his unconditional acceptance and support of his brother's sexuality. According to the author, \\"He's sort of a man's man who doesn't care that his brother is gay.\\" While Taylor's parents are the kind of people \\"who meddle and then get distracted by something and disappear,\\" Tom's parents are more traditional and provided him with a solid upbringing. Tom and his mom are close and she approves of Tom's choice of a mate.<br /><br />There are other characters who add to the story but you'll have to read Finding Peace for yourself to find out who they are and how they affect the world of Taylor and Tom.<br /><br />Plot twists and turns-not to be revealed here-make for an engrossing and entertaining read. Barriger accomplishes this feat with wit and charm. He turns adversity into something propitious, tragedy into triumph, and even manages to redeem some despicable characters. By the giving of yourself to others, you reap rewards that far surpass what you gave. Andrew Barriger is currently working on the sequel to Finding Peace, tentatively titled, Finding Hope.

US	29645443	R218C07SBNENSG	1857029402	128201608	Brokeback Mountain	Books	5	158	162	N	Y	Review of Brokeback Mountain by Cheri	Annie Proulx, a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist, packs a tremendous amount of information and incredible prose in 58 short pages. Brokeback Mountain is a heart-wrenching, gritty novella about two tough ranch hands who meet on a job, and, inexplicably, fall in love. These stoic, impecunious, high-school dropouts, who live rough lives, are desperately in need of work. Both Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist sign up with Farm and Ranch Employment and end up herding for the same sheep operation on Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Ennis is engaged to be married when he meets Jack and does not consider himself queer. Neither does Jack. The two men embark on an intimacy that they feel is their own business, as long as it isn't hurting anybody else. It's just sex between two, lonely, horny, guys and it means nothing. When the summer is over and they part, Ennis feels horrible about leaving Jack. If, what they had together meant nothing, then why can't Ennis shake the bad feeling separation brings?<br /><br />Ennis and Jack lose track of each other for four years and are reunited as married men with children. The love affair picks up where it left off during that summer on Brokeback Mountain. They share a forbidden love, sweeter than each man has with his wife, but, actions against conventional relationships could prove to be deadly. Cowboys, even tough ones, who admitted to being gay, were often tortured and murdered. Jack wants to have a life with Ennis and start up a ranch with him. Ennis is neither ready nor willing to give up his heterosexual lifestyle, even if he does love Jack<br /><br />The detail with which Proulx describes the setting puts the reader in the mountains of Wyoming, surrounded by meadows, sheep, coyotes, and the expansive sky. You can smell the horses, campfire, beer, and cigarettes as Ennis and Jack sit around at night trading stories and getting to know each other. You can feel the exhaustion of the back-breaking work of tending sheep. Proulx delights the reader with accounts of every feeling, scent, and action. The dialect is precise and the text is never tedious or boring; it simply enriches the story as vitamins enrich food. With narration like this, the reader knows exactly what is going on and is transported into every nuance of the story.<br /><br />Annie Proulx is in the same class as John Steinbeck and Mark Twain, in my humble opinion. I cannot stress enough how well written this book is, or what a gut wrenching story it is but I can stress how highly I recommend reading this book. My only complaint is that it is too short.  Do not miss reading Brokeback Mountain. Soon, it will be made into a major motion picture, which I hope will be true to the book.<br />.ery feeling, scent, and action.

He is a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist, who is willing to put his personal safety on the line for the perfect picture to illustrate a story. When Peter sets his mind to something, he will go to any extent to achieve his goal.Next, we meet Craig Walters, a flight attendant, a theater major in college, who never realized his dream of being a big star. Working for the airlines has its perquisites: he has good benefits and gets to travel. He may not be as rich and famous as his best friend, Peter, but he makes a living. Peter was not always rich. In fact, he knows all too well what it feels like to be hungry so he anonymously donates money to food banks and soup kitchens. He is a true philanthropist in every sense of the word. Peter and Craig met in college and have been friends for twenty years. They were roommates and even dated for a while but, while Craig lives as an openly gay man, Peter remains in the closet. Peter felt that coming out of the closet would hurt their careers, so he kept his door tightly shut, even though Craig did not. Peter denied his intense feelings for Craig while the two men remained close friends and lived in apartments right next to each other.When Peter wants to relocate he finally professes his love for Craig and asks him to go with him. Peter discloses his homosexuality publicly and they become a couple once again. Peter is not subtle at work and he is not subtle in his personal life. He feels guilty for the years of denying who he is, especially for not helping his gay community fight for its rights. Peter decides to help his community in a very big way.Peter was oblivious to the discrimination gays faced; gay sub-culture was foreign to him. Craig has to fill Peter in on everything, as if Peter has been living on the moon, instead of here in the USA. Some of Craig's explanations to Peter make the reader wonder how any well-informed citizen would not know certain basic facts. You do not have to be gay to find such explanations tedious but, to anyone in need of lessons on being gay, it could be helpful.Almost Paradise is a story about one man's quest to make a difference in the lives of GLBT people everywhere. Peter orchestrates a migration to Hawaii that eventually leads to his seeking public office. He hopes to change laws enjoyed only by heterosexuals. If elected, he promises, and I quote, &quot;These rights would include the right to marry, to adopt children, freedom from discrimination in housing and employment, and all state sponsored tax rights offered to married heterosexual couples.&quot; If he wins the governorship, he will not only fight for gay rights but he will represent all his constituents whether they are gay or straight. He will govern for the good of all. For the first time in his life, Peter is not afraid to use his celebrity to further his cause. Patt Gavin writes an interesting, timely story about gays rallying together for a cause in order to make some positive changes in the legislation concerning gay rights and marriage. While the story may seem far-fetched at times, it is the privilege of an author of fiction to take such liberties. He hits upon a good idea for accomplishing their goals.

Donaghe before and during his tour in the United States Air Force during the last years of the Vietnam War.<br />My Year offers a different perspective of what it was like to be in the military during a war which the American people were not particularly proud. On top of that, he tells what it meant to be gay in an extremely homophobic environment. Donaghe does an amazing job of enlightening the clueless public.<br />This is his own account of getting married to suppress his homosexuality only to realize the enormity of his mistake. Donaghe is seduced by an older, divorced mother of two who knew he was gay before she married him. She was convinced the right woman could \\"cure\\" his homosexual proclivity. Being disillusioned by the gay scene at the time, he acquiesced. He then joined the air force to get away from his wife and marital duties. Later, he used his sexual orientation to escape the service.<br />Donaghe provides us with an eye-opening, honest and graphic depiction of the potentially dangerous assignments enforced by the Pentagon on the men and women of the military. He was assigned a job after basic training working long, grueling, tedious hours in a lab. This lab's only purpose was to test tens of thousands of urine samples per day for the presence of drugs. These \\"important\\" tasks were being performed at the same time men were being killed and maimed in combat. The conditions of the lab were horrendous with noxious fumes and carcinogenic chemicals. A daily working environment such as this may not kill instantly like a bullet but who knows what the long term affects on health are?<br />This book deals not only with coming out to the military but of coming full circle towards accepting and loving oneself as an out and proud gay man. It is a story about finding love--the love that is meant to be--and not necessarily manufactured to fit in with societal mores.<br />Donaghe is often funny and makes this an enjoyable read, but most of all, he teaches us to be truthful to ourselves and not let others define our self worth. Only by being proud of who we are can we achieve our greatest contribution to society. It also offers hope that maybe someday GLBT people will be welcome in the military and receive the same rights and privileges as heterosexuals and not be persecuted for who they are and who they love. Ronald Donaghe was very fortunate he was granted an honorable discharge, although without distinction. He was not treated as poorly as many other homosexuals in the military at that time--men and women whose only crime was wanting to serve their country. By writing this book he hopes to educate people so that discrimination will finally cease to exist. Don't miss this honest and open account of a man who strives to make a difference. A man who has learned from his mistakes and has shared what he has learned with others. A man who has  positively influenced the lives of those who are fortunate to  know him and to the many others who read this well-written, heartfelt biography.etal mores.<br />Donaghe is often funny and makes this an enjoyable read, but most of all, he teaches us to be truthful to ourselves and not let others define our self worth.

The fact that he is down-to-earth and non-pretentious makes him sweet and loveable. It does not hurt that he is nice to look at and has a good sense of humor, too. Taylor has everything going for him.  He is on top of the world until he arrives home to find his lover of two years in the arms of another man?laying on his pillow no less!<br /><br />Taylor's defense mechanism is to run. He ends up on the doorstep of his best friend and confidant, Genevieve (Gen) Pouissant. Gen invites Taylor to move in with her until he gets his life back together. Taylor takes to living in her charming, friendly small town and soon grows to love it, especially when he gets a crush on a cute baker and post-grad student named Tom McEwan. Taylor and Tom become fast friends and each longs to take it a step further, but neither one has the nerve to make the first move.<br /><br />Taylor is not one to care whether or not anyone knows he is gay, but he does not want to jeopardize a possible relationship with Tom. It could be that Tom does not want to be outed in their small town. The more time they spend together, the more Taylor wants Tom to be part of his life.If only he could tell him.<br /><br />Taylor decides to buy his own house in town and enlists the help of a realtor named Faith Roberts. Faith wants more from Taylor than a commission. She is after this handsome, Jaguar-driving bachelor and is relentless in her efforts to win his favor.<br /><br />Meanwhile, well-meaning friends introduce Taylor to Neil Gardener, a wealthy, self-confident, super model type of guy, who is not only out, but he is more than interested in Taylor. Neil makes it hard for Taylor to resist him, complicating his feelings for Tom.<br /><br />Andrew Barriger's debut novel, Finding Faith, is fast-paced, fun to read, and thoroughly enjoyable. I love Barriger's use of language, his delectable desserts, loveable characters, and suspenseful story, not in a murder mystery sort of way, but in the who will Taylor end up with? sort of way.

How desperate would you be if you were denied the freedom to love, to be with the person of your dreams? The one person who makes you feel complete. This is portrayed in the all too familiar story of boy meets boy, boy falls in love with boy, and boy has to choose between boy and family. Latter Days the book, written from the screenplay, is a replica of the movie except for a few minor details. C. Jay Cox wrote the screenplay. The book, adapted by T. Fabris, won the Audience Award as the Outstanding First Narrative Feature, Los Angeles Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.<br />Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss), a 19 year-old Morman, has never been away from home. He is called to serve as a missionary for his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His assignment is in Hollywood, California where he will spend two years. He makes the pilgrimage from Pocatello, Idaho to California, full of hope and promise that he will make his church and family proud. He studies the Bible and its teachings diligently. He loves the church and the feeling of belonging, but there is one big problem--he is gay. He falls in love with another boy, Christian. His church insists Aaron repent for his sins and forever deny who he is. Living as a homosexual is not an option. The church forces Aaron to choose between Christian and his religion.<br />Christian Markelli (Wes Ramsey) is a vivacious, gorgeous, party animal. His claim to fame is his ability to get straight boys to have sex with him. He works as a waiter and bus boy at Lila's Restaurant-so does his roommate and best friend, Julie. His other friends are co-workers, Andrew and Traci. When Aaron and three other young Mormons move into Christian and Julie's apartment complex, Andrew, Traci, Julie and Chris make a $50 bet to see if Chris can get one of the missionaries to sleep with him. Chris and Julie bet he could do it; Andrew and Traci bet he could not. Christian had no idea that he was going to fall in love with Aaron, or that Aaron would return his love.<br />Julie (Rebekah Jordan) is an aspiring singer. Through a connection, she gets Clive Davis to listen to her demo album. Chris and Julie are more than roommates; they support and love one another like family.<br />Andrew (Khary Payton), the bartender at Lila's, has wisdom beyond his years because he has been HIV positive from a very young age. He convinces Christian to volunteer to help deliver food to housebound AIDS victims. Chris takes him up on his offer after Aaron tells him he is shallow and compares him to a \\"marshmallow peep\\"-a perfect analogy. Chris wants to prove to Aaron that he is not just a pretty face who only cares about getting laid.<br />Traci (Amber Benson) is an aspiring actress whose parents are not too crazy about her career choice.<br />Lila (Jacqueline Bisset) owns Lila's Restaurant and is the epitome of culture, grace, and poise. She is a mother figure to Christian and Aaron when their own parents are not willing to fulfill their roles. One of her best lines to Aaron is, \\"Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals. I am definitely not joining.\\" Aaron was there for Lila in her time of need and Lila returns the favor to Aaron. They were each others' angel.<br /> Aaron is kicked out of the missionary program and sent home after getting caught kissing Christian. Christian does not want to let him go that easily and tries to get him back.<br />The set design is amazing and meaningful, as we see when Aaron returns home.  His father is disappointed and his mother is cold. By contrast, the house is colorful and bright; even the kitchen cabinets are cheery. The house was decorated before Aaron shamed his family by admitting he is gay-designed when Aaron showed promise and potential to follow his father's example and become a church leader. The cheerful design makes Aaron's mother seem that much harsher by comparison.<br />I loved Latter Days, the movie and the book, for many reasons but most of all for the important story it tells and the lesson it teaches. The lesson being that love comes in all forms and no person or church should have the right to condemn love between two people of the same sex. Many tragedies and near disasters could be avoided.heerful design makes Aaron's mother seem that much harsher by comparison.<br />I loved Latter Days, the movie and the book, for many reasons but most of all for the important story it tells and the lesson it teaches.

Donaghe is a wonderful collection of essays that are filled with love, hope, despair, some anger, adventure, realizations, relationships, and the importance of a family's love and support. It may be a thin book to the naked eye, but it is thick in content, wit, wisdom, and humor. This small book is so full of what life is all about, what is really important, that you are happy to be along for the ride, picking up bits of advice that may apply to your own life, as you go along.<br />Donaghe takes us on an adventure from the depths of despair, over the break up of a fourteen year old relationship with a man he thought he would spend the rest of his life with, to the renewal of hope that, time, experience, strong family ties, and connections with other people--even strangers, brings. \\"Letters in Search of Love\\" is an open and honest account of a young man's feelings and experiences during a difficult time in his life.<br />This true story makes the reader feel privileged to be allowed into the private mind of the writer while coming to the realization that we are not as unique as we thought. We often share the same feelings, emotions, and thoughts, and because of this, we need each other, and there is a strong connection to one another.<br />In response to the pain, sorrow, and possibly even depression, Donaghe posts a letter in a rural gay magazine, RFD, in hopes of finding love or at least to connect with other people with similar circumstances. The responses he receives all help him through his healing and he summarizes some of them from the most poignant to the most absurd. Most importantly he shows that it is through human contact that one can heal thy soul, and be able to move on, and hopefully find love again.<br />As an adult, he went back home to live with his parents and to help them in their failing health--only to be healed himself by their unconditional love and understanding. He does not regret for a moment this dark period in his life since he was able to \\"rediscover\\" his parents and appreciate all they had unselfishly, sacrificed and done for him, and his five siblings, even helping friends, extended family, and strangers alike. They were excellent role models who helped shape the person Ronald Donaghe is today.<br />My favorite essay is, \\"The Healing Place\\" because it is a beautiful tribute to his parents and shows his roots. Any parent would be proud to call Ron Donaghe their son, and his words and actions are the best thank you they could receive, for raising him right.<br />Donaghe's essays show a kind and intelligent man who may not be wealthy in worldly possessions, at this stage of his life, but is wealthy in what is most important in life, and that is love, caring, compassion, and appreciation for nature and the simple pleasures in life. This is a man whose belief in equality for all human beings regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation, is best expressed in his essay, \\"The Old Man and St. Louis\\", when he compares the plight of gays to that of the Negro slaves. It was an excellent analogy--worth reading and thinking about. In this essay he describes his employment by a sick old man, as his chauffeur, driving him from New Mexico to Missouri, for his last trip to visit his family.<br />Other essays in this book include: \\"My Sister and I\\", about his loving relationship with one of his sisters; \\"AIDS in Paradise\\", about his adventure working on a goat farm where he was able to strip down all the conventions of modern living and get back to the bare bones of nature, gaining both inner and outer strength; and \\"Deming, New Mexico\\", where the reader gets to happily share Donaghe's joy and excitement of having his first book published, and coming out of the closet to his hometown. Best of all, the people in Deming didn't make too much of a fuss about his being gay, and they celebrated his book, even if they weren't thrilled with the gay theme. Ifit bothered them to know he is gay, they didn't let on. He learned he would always have a place to come home to.<br />\\"Letters in Search of Love\\" just reaffirms my love for the fiction and non-fiction written by one of my favorite authors, Ronald L. Donaghe. He teaches many valuable lessons and even though he posted on his website that you could read this book without purchasing it, I recommend buying this book at any price.

Donaghe, is the next installment of \\"The Common Threads in the Life series\\", following \\"Common Sons\\" and \\"The Blind Season\\". This book ties in characters from its predecessors and will be included in the much awaited forth book in the series entitled, \\"The Gathering\\".<br />Donaghe does not disappoint the reader with his creative style and wit, and while I would not consider it an \\"enjoyable\\" book, unless the reader enjoys human cruelty, it is an account worth writing and reading about. Most people would agree that it is not pleasurable to read about the Holocaust, however, we still must remember it so that hopefully, we can learn from it. Trying to make gay people straight is atrocious and inhumane.<br />The setting is the Lion's Mouth Christian Church Ranch in the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico, in 1998.  We learn about what goes on there through the journals of Kelly O'Kelly, who loses his lover, William, to suicide after attending the retreat to cleanse his soul of homosexuality. William, having failed to become straight after all he went through, loses all hope to be \\"normal\\" and he takes his own life.<br />Kelly goes to this ranch where crack-pot ministers teach people to repress their natural inclinations, and deny their homosexuality, in order to become \\"saved\\". Kelly poses as a recruit in order to find out first hand (and expose) the truth about the Lion's Mouth Christian Ranch (LMCR) which purports to \\"cure\\" homosexuality through prayer and discipline. Can a person be delivered from living life as a homosexual, to become truly heterosexual? According to this ministry, \\"All things are possible through Christ\\".  Their teachings also include condoning celibacy over same-sex love.<br />Kelly maintains a record of the daily steps toward salvation which include, inhumane treatment, semi-starvation, isolation, lack of privacy, hard work in often intolerable conditions, constant prayer, ridicule, spirit-breaking, reinforcing self-hatred, and boot camp like tactics to brainwash their victims.<br />As you read Kelly's daily log you can not believe this could happen in real life, however, as Donaghe states in the beginning of his novel, the story is based on truth and actual events. Pretty scary stuff!<br />Reading about atrocities imposed on the young men is not meant to be pleasant but is meant to educate against the evils lurking in our society disguised as religion, family values, morality, and political agendas.<br />Is rape and death also part of the ex-gay ministry? Will Kelly make it through \\"eighteen steps to salvation\\", unharmed emotionally and physically?  And will he be able to expose the LMCR for what it is and save others from denying their true identity and suppressing their innate, God-given desires?  It is interesting to read how each of the recruits handles the retreat's regimes depending on their differing degrees of self-hatred, willingness to change, and commitment to the teachings. Read this book and find out.<br />The author's commentary in the after word is reason enough for reading this book. Donaghe makes many valid points and offers powerful arguments against anti-gay beliefs and legislation.  His discussions include, \\"The Salvation Mongers 2000-The Real Thing\\", \\"Treatment Options and Attitudes Toward Homosexuality\\" and \\"The Dark Side of the EX-Gay Ministries\\".  The fact that these ex-gay ministries exist today is mind boggling and that people willingly subject themselves to the poison and brainwashing in desperate hope of a \\"cure\\", as if wanting to be straight bad enough is something they can achieve, is truly sad.<br />Don't miss this book if for no other reason than it is the bridge between \\"The Blind Season\\" and the much awaited book, \\"The Gathering\\", which promises to bring Joel, Tom and the family back together again in Common, New Mexico, as the year 2000 approaches. According to Donaghe, \\"Kelly is going to play a major role in \\"The Gathering\\" as the conscience for all those gays who try to get `cured' by subjecting themselves to the ex-gay programs\\".cience for all those gays who try to get `cured' by subjecting themselves to the ex-gay programs\\".	2004-04-12

Roeder, is an engrossing tale of two boys from different worlds who fall in love. Readers may already be familiar with Roeder's other books in the \\"Gay Youth Chronicles\\" series. These include, \\"Ancient Prejudice\\", \\"The Soccer Field is Empty\\" and \\"Someone is Watching\\", to name a few.<br />It is sad that young boys are taunted and shamed into keeping their true identities securely hidden. What could Brendan, a beautiful, incredibly popular, seventeen year old boy, captain of the football team, and an A student, have to fear when he seems to have the world on a plate? The truth is that he is gay and if anyone finds out, his life as he knows it, will be over. Could such fear of discovery be worth taking your own life, or even thinking about it?<br />And what does Casper have to fear? He is fifteen, motherless, poor, lonely, and tormented by his brother, neglected by his alcoholic father, and bullied at school. He never gets sufficient food to eat, has a sparse wardrobe, and often sleeps outdoors to escape his abusive brother. He hasn't even admitted to himself that he likes boys. What would happen to him if people suspected he was gay too?<br />Brendan and Casper make an unlikely couple, the rich boy who has everything, and the poor boy that has nothing, but they hook up. Their relationship is a bit stormy at first but Casper learns to trust Brendan, comes to terms with his homosexuality, and is able to return Brendan's love.<br />Roeder gives us an amazing portrayal of the fear, self-loathing, and other problems these boys experience because of their sexual orientation. He captures the boys' emotions so deeply that the reader's own heart breaks for them and for all boys like them. It is disgraceful that they are made to feel perverted, abnormal, and inferior because much of society has deemed homosexuality immoral.<br />It makes any accepting human being want to fix society, to change the puritanical idea that same sex love is wrong, to pass legislation that makes same sex marriage legal, and accept that it is diversity that makes our country great. We should all be free to love who we want without fear of discrimination, hatred, and prejudice.<br />Anyone who has ever been teased or tormented appreciates the emotional toll it takes on self confidence and self esteem. It is depressing to hear Casper describe himself as \\"poor, unpopular, weak, puny, and pathetic,\\" while the reader sees a sweet, loveable, bright, and undernourished boy. Brendan's love for Casper makes him even more desirable.<br />Roeder shows, parents who can not accept their children's sexual orientation and love them unconditionally, parents who do not protect their children, and a society that allows places like Cloverdale, a mental institution that uses physical, chemical (drugs), and psychological means to \\"cure\\" people of their homosexuality. There can be no equality and freedom until people accept that nothing can (or should) be done to make gay people straight.<br />This story offers hope that a better place, away from fear, hatred, intolerance, and discrimination, does exist and at the same time, tells a heartwarming, exciting, and enjoyable story. I love Mark Roeder's books and hope he continues to share his talent with us for years to come.pass legislation that makes same sex marriage legal, and accept that it is diversity that makes our country great.

US	29645443	R2UJN7AL867H97	0964109964	315138860	The Front Runner: A Novel	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Review of The Front Runner by Cheri	\\"The Front Runner\\", by Patricia Nell Warren, is the critically acclaimed, best selling novel, touted as being, \\"the most celebrated gay love story ever\\" and rightly so. This is not including the fact that it has been in print from 1974-2001, in several languages, and by mainstream publishers. The 20th Anniversary Edition of this novel shows the impressive print history.<br />Becoming aware of this book more than 20 years after it came out is a mixed blessing. One, I don't have to wait 20 years for the sequel, Harlan's Race, and, two, I get to enjoy it now. My expectations of this book, with all the hype, have been greatly exceeded. For anyone who is new to gay fiction this is a book that is NOT to be missed.<br />Patricia Nell Warren wrote an amazing, timeless, authentic, and accurate portrayal of gay life in the 70's, including all the feelings and struggles for equal rights, at that time, many of which are still prevalent today. Gay men are unable to comprehend how a woman could so perfectly capture their feelings and lifestyle to produce a believable, wonderfully written, piece of fiction. As a woman, I am proud of what she has achieved.<br />\\"The Front Runner\\" is about a track coach, Harlan, who has had more than his share of discrimination and heartache because he is gay, so remains virtually closeted in order to maintain some sort of normalcy in his life...and protect his job at Prescott College. He is an ex-Marine who has been through it all, including marriage, loss of his coaching position at Penn State, and hustling to pay alimony, to name a few. By the time he gets to coach at Prescott, he is very careful not to jeopardize his position there, even if it means not allowing love in his life. For him coaching and running is what life is all about and he doesn't like the thought of losing it again.<br />Billy is a beautiful runner who comes to Prescott with two of his friends after they were kicked off a prestigious college team when it was discovered they were gay. Not to give up running, Billy, Vince, and Jacques, go to Prescott hoping to be accepted by the incredibly gifted coach, who is also gay. These boys are talented runners, with Olympic dreams, and they hope Harlan can get them there.<br />The plot thickens when Harlan suppresses his love and intense yearning for Billy, only to discover that Billy loves him too. Harlan finally succumbs to his love and he and Billy form a special but potentially dangerous bond that could jeopardize both their careers.<br />It is wonderful to read how Billy changes Harlan's life and makes Harlan's deep seated unhappiness dissolve. Love has a healing power like no other human emotion. The difference in the age between coach and student is insignificant as they are both consenting adults. Billy is the more mature one at times, especially in how he accepts his sexual orientation and deals with discrimination. Harlan is Billy's mentor, friend, and lover. There is a harmonious balance between these two characters.  What could be wrong or unnatural about two men being deeply in love?<br />Ms. Warren's opinions resonate throughout this novel and she makes many valid points about gay rights. One of the things that struck me as interesting is how society can oppose legalizing gay unions when it is promiscuity and noncommittal relationships that are so undesirable to the glue that supposedly holds this country together. Loose behavior is not exclusive to the gay community. I feel that with equal rights and legal bonds for gay couples, there would be far less \\"immoral\\" behavior, however, there's no denying the fact that plenty of legally wed heterosexual couples cheat on their spouses.<br />After reading this book, I will never look at running or the Olympics the same way again. \\"The Front Runner\\" depicts the numerous roadblocks gay athletes have to endure in order to compete in a hostile, homophobic world. When watching a race it is hard to think about politics, sexual orientation, or asinine rules governed by ignorant, inflexible, bigots. Races should be about the athletic ability alone in deciding who gets the gold. How any good can come out of evil is the cornerstone of this novel. One has to wonder why it takes a tragedy to open up people's eyes to the absurdity of hatred.<br />I am very passionate about recommending this book to those who have not yet read it and I strongly recommend a reread for those of you who enjoyed \\"The Front Runner\\" and possibly were helped by it 20 years ago. Patricia Nell Warren is easily one of the best writers of gay fiction and I am looking forward to reading more of her works. .sinine rules governed by ignorant, inflexible, bigots.

Donaghe, is the first book in the series: \\"The Continuing Journals of Will Barnett\\".  It is a sweet story; you can't help falling in love with Will and caring about him.  Plus, the positive impact Uncle Sean has on Will is also worth noting and admiring. You hate for the book to end!  Fortunately it doesn't have to, with two sequels already in print, \\"Lance\\" and \\"All Over Him\\".<br />The story begins when Will is 14 years old and gets an idea to keep a journal.  Will is compelled to write down his feelings when his Uncle Sean comes to live with his family after being discharged from the army.  Will falls in love with his uncle the moment he lays eyes on him.  He thinks Uncle Sean is \\"pretty\\" and he longs to kiss his lips.  Loving Uncle Sean stirs up emotions and desires Will didn't know he possessed.  He is naïve and totally unaware there could be any danger in loving, not only another boy, but a man, who also happens to be his uncle.<br />Will and Sean form a special bond.  Sean tries to impart words of wisdom about love and what it means to be gay.  He also impresses upon Will the importance of saving himself for the one he loves and not having sex with the first boy he meets.  Innocently, Will doesn't understand why he and Sean can`t be boyfriends, so Sean leaves Will with some pearls of wisdom that he will only understand once he matures.  The physical attraction between uncle and nephew is so palpable you feel sure Sean will inappropriately give Will what he so desperately wants. The fact that Sean understands his nephew's feelings and doesn't take advantage of him reaffirms our faith in morality and decency.<br />Unfortunately, Will's parents are afraid of Sean's influence on their son and question the nature of their relationship since they suspect Sean is gay.  So, what is a totally innocent and healthy relationship between the two is misconstrued by Will's parents to be something perverse.  The tension between Sean and Will's father causes Sean to move away much to Will's dismay further adding to the boy's loneliness.<br />When  Will meets Lance, a troubled boy close to his own age, he falls in love.  When you finish the last page of \\"Uncle Sean\\" you better have \\"Lance\\", the sequel, handy because you won't be able to wait to find out what happens to Will, Lance, Sean and the rest of the family.<br />Ronald L. Donaghe enriches this story with beautiful descriptions of the southern New Mexican landscape, the intricacies of family life, and the workings of a farm.  The dialect in the beginning of the book, as the younger Will writes, sets the mood and makes Will more real.  You get to watch him grow, fall in love, deal with loss, and take up life's responsibilities.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book for its honesty, intensity of feelings and the raw emotions it provokes in all of us as we relive our own experiences with our first crush while dealing with raging hormones and mixed up feelings.  Donaghe is a talented writer and a great storyteller.  \\"Uncle Sean\\" keeps you engrossed from beginning to end.

Roeder is the book for you if you are in the mood for a fast-paced, exciting, love story about an ordinary boy, Ralph, and his obsession for a famous rock star, Jordan. Ralph lives on a farm in Indiana and he is madly, passionately, and deeply in love with the lead singer and keyboardist of the rock group, Phantom. Jordan is a talented rock star who loves his music, cares about his fans and feels blessed that he gets to do what he loves best, writing and performing his music. He is also a lonely boy with a secret. Jordan loves his life but sometimes he wishes he could live a normal life like other boys his age.<br />Who hasn't fantasized about meeting a favorite star? And what could be better than not only meeting him but getting to spend time with him as well? Not many of us have realized our dreams of meeting our idols, but it is fun to read about and imagine it happening to us. Mark Roeder is so good at putting readers in the character's shoes.<br />Not only is this book a page turner, as you want to find out what happens to Ralph and Jordan, but it offers an inside look of how a rock band lives while on tour. It is the star's version of traveling from city to city, endless scheduling of press conferences, photo shoots and autograph signing. It is not as glamorous as it seems to the hoards of screaming fans.<br />Roeder also tells the story through a fan's perspective and takes us along for the ride. It is an exciting ride for those who have had dreams of being famous themselves or of meeting their favorite star. I have had some pretty serious crushes in my life on actors I thought were amazing and I wanted desperately to meet. So when Ralph does meet Jordan after the Phantom concert, I had no trouble knowing exactly how he felt.<br />This book is much more than a love story; it is a self-help book for members of the gay community who suffer from low self esteem and self doubt because of the negative opinions of much of society.<br />Roeder hopes to teach our youth to love and accept themselves.  He cites excellent examples of famous gays who have contributed greatly to society, so that they may feel better about themselves. The many gay people who have used their fame to make a difference in this world by coming out has significantly helped other gays feel better about themselves.<br />The time has come for heterosexuals to give homosexuals the credit they deserve and to treat them with the same respect and afford them the same rights as straight people. Roeder said it best when he wrote, \\"Without the gay population, Western culture would not exist as we know it\\".<br />Read \\"Do You Know That I Love You?\\" You will be glad you did as Roeder has more than a few surprises for his fans. I have read many books I felt would make a good move but trust me when I say this book would make a great movie. Get me Harvey Weinstien of Miramax on the phone.ociety.<br />Roeder hopes to teach our youth to love and accept themselves.

US	29645443	RQIQNKXRZG5QF	1932300163	58539947	Stepping Out: Short Stories	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Review of "Stepping Out: Short Stories" by Cheri	Lori L. Lake has written an insightful collection of short stories in her latest book, \\"Stepping Out: Short Stories\\". If you are not familiar with her other best-selling books, \\"Different Dress\\", \\"Under the Gun\\", \\"Gun Shy\\", and \\"Ricochet In Time\\", \\"Stepping Out,\\" will have certainly whet your appetite.<br />Each story brings forth interesting characters and situations you long to know more about. Lori Lake can easily have fourteen more novels to write and the reader is left hoping that is her intention.<br />It is much more difficult to write a short story than a novel because the writer has limited time and space to expand upon the characters and story line. There is little time to develop the plot - it has to be there and be there quick. Lori Lake does an excellent job with this task.<br />Each of the short stories is timeless and authentic in its portrayal of real people and their lives. I appreciate how Lake mentions the feelings of elderly parents about having their independence interfered with, even from well meaning children, as in, \\"The Bright Side\\". This is a point that hits home for any baby boomer currently worrying about who will take care of their aging parents. And more importantly, how will they get their parents to accept their help? In this story we also see a mother who is so critical of her daughter she compliments her on her weight loss even though it is due to chemotherapy for breast cancer! This is in addition to her disappointment that her daughter is gay and throwing it in her daughter's face even during a family crisis. Anyone who has a critical mother and most of us do in one way or another can relate to this story. This is not to say that we don't love our mothers, but our mothers' unfavorable comments can hurt the worst.<br />\\"Afraid of the Dark\\", is about a mother and daughter who get lost while driving to an American Quilt Exhibit and end up stuck in a bad neighborhood. The author so perfectly shows the ignorance and potentially dangerous side of prejudice. It is a sad story about a mother who can't get past her prejudices enough to love or trust people who are different from her. The daughter, Marin, allows herself to be set up for the verbal abuse her mother consistently dishes out while secretly hoping her mother will change and accept her for who she is and accept people for who they are and not based on race, religion, or sexual orientation. Unfortunately, this is not a new story with racial profiling and homophobia ridiculously ingrained in our society so that even many parents have trouble accepting their own children. Like Marin, we hope this will change in our lifetime.<br />I also enjoyed, \\"Busybody\\" because it is so true that you cannot judge a book by its cover. What we perceive in a person may not be what is really there. In fact you may be pleasantly surprised with what you find if you open up your heart.<br />Each story brings forth a wisdom that we all should possess as we go through life. Lake reminds us of society's short-sightedness to allow discrimination of overweight or obese people while glorifying anorexic models and actresses and paying them millions. It is no wonder that most girls have distorted body images and that eating disorders are prevalent.<br /> \\"My Lifesaving Journal\\" is about a girl who dreams of being a hero because she has a low opinion of herself. She is fat and feels unworthy of love - even life. Isn't it about time society learns that a person's size is not what matters; it is what is inside that counts? It is about time we moved away from being so beauty and weight conscious and concentrate on being happy and healthy by exercising, eating right, and feeling good about ourselves.<br />The father who writes to his daughter in \\"A Letter from Father\\", pleading forgiveness for any homophobia he may have possessed in the past while hoping to regain her presence in his life, is heartwarming. These are just a few examples of what you may find in this book. Something positive can be said about each story but I prefer you read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions and choose the ones that hold the most meaning for you. Each reader will find something that they can relate to or learn from in this fine collection of short stories. I highly recommend this book and will add it to my collection of favorite authors.ing positive can be said about each story but I prefer you read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions and choose the ones that hold the most meaning for you.
