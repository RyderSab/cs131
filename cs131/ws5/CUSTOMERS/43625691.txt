US	43625691	R9MWT3HFDA4ZE	0821776436	118369600	Let It Snow	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Great Christmas romances	Although Fern Michaels is obviously the author the editors are hoping will lure readers to this book, I brought it because of Marcia Evanick.  I stumbled across her first two books about the residents of Misty Harbor, Maine and thoroughly enjoyed them and have been anxiously her next book.  I have to say, that I was not the least bit disappointed in her story and I thoroughly enjoyed the other three stories as well.<br />In A Misty Harbor Christmas, Olivia Hamilton comes back to Misty Harbor for her grandmother's funeral.  When she inherits her grandmother's house where she spent summers as a child, she decides to sell it because her life is in California.  As a child, Olivia had a huge crush on Ethan Wycliffe, her grandmother's neighbor.  Ethan still lives in Misty Harbor and still lives next door to grandma's house.  When he and Olivia start spending time together, Ethan hopes there's still some of that crush left over because he's sure developing one for Olivia.<br />In All I Want for Christmas by Holly Chamberlin, all Abby Walker wants is to find a normal man fall in love with and have a family.  While her life takes some pretty comic turns, you keep rooting for her to connect with the handsome stranger that she keeps running into (and I mean that literally).   <br />Merry, Merry by Fern Michaels is a reprint from the mid-90's.  Andi Evans is trying to keep her veterinary practice afloat and hold onto her family's land.  Cosmetic tycoon Peter King thinks Andi's land is the perfect site for his new factory and is determined to buy it.  The two butt heads aplenty on their way to romance.<br />Christmas Eve by Virginia Henley is also a reprint from the mid-90's.  Feminist real estate agent Eve Barlow is sent to show a remote Michigan log home to hunky firefighter Clint Kelly on December 23rd.  Clint has no use for feminists and he and Eve butt heads aplenty.  When Eve gets mad at Clint while they are looking over the log home's grounds, she ends up falling throughthe ice on the small pond.  Clint saves her and takes her into the house to warm up.  The two get snowed in but is able to see Eve's vulnerability beneath her feminist fa√ßade and finds her very attractive.  When the two get snowed in for several days, they quickly discover that maybe their differences aren't quite so insurmountable.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I will definitely look for the upcoming works by Marcia Evanick and Holly Chamberlin.	2003-11-15

I really enjoyed the three stories and had they been independent books would have loved them, probably given them 4 stars.  BUT, they were put together in a trilogy  and by the third story I was so distracted by the editing, or lack there of, that I couldn't enjoy what was happening with the characters.  I want to say that I'm not usually very picky about editing but this was just to glaring.  These three stories were supposed to all happen the same 2-3 week Christmas period.    When Faith's children were introduced in the first story, they were 5 and 8, in the other two stories they were 6 and 9.  A dinner invitation in the second story that Ann Elise didn't want to accept in the second story so Faith accepted it, in the third story they had Ann Elise making a big deal about how she accepted a surprise invitation for all of them to the country club.  If you can look past the editing, I think you'll enjoy this book.  If bad editing drives you up the wall, skip this one.	2003-11-14

In actually, Kayla is a very smart accountant who has inherited her aunt's etiquette business, Charmed.  The police received a lead that Charmed is a front for a prostitution ring.  Detective Kane McDermott is sent to investigate.  Kane poses as a traveling salesman who needs pointers for a big dinner with his boss.  He convinces Kayla to go out to dinner with him hoping he can trap her.  It doesn't take long for Kane to realize that Kayla is innocent but he is so attracted to her that he can't cut the evening short.  The two end up spending the night together.  The next morning when Kayla goes back to her business, there is a thug waiting for her who demands to know where the \\"money and books\\" are.  When Kayla's sister comes in the front, the thug runs out the back.  The sisters call the police to report what happened and guess who shows up...Kane.  Kane is now convinced that there had been a prostitution ring run out of Charmed before Kayla inherited the business and that her life is in danger.  When his boss won't authorize protection for Kayla, he takes leave and guards her himself.<br />This was a very good book.  I sat down and read it in one evening.  The relationship between Kayla and Kane was very touching to see develop.	2003-11-05

She did great!<br />This book concentrates on Jim Randall, Chad and Megan's son.  When he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend, he comes to her assistance against a renegade militia group.  The latest in the Randall series has a little more action than the other books in the series but the characters have the same strength and the story is very well developed.  If you're a fan of the Randall series of books, be sure to not miss this one.	2003-11-05

Books	3	8	8	N	N	A disappointment	This is one of the introductory books in Harlequin's new Flipside line that promises to be \\"fun, witty, unexpected\\".  I liked the premise of the book:  Corrine decides to teach her two timing boyfriend a lesson by dumping him and then going on a two week vacation so he can see what life is like without her and beg her to come back to him.  Corrine's best friend Matthew is in love with Corrine so he show up on her vacation determined to win over her heart before she goes back to the sleazebag.  Matthew is a great character and could win over any woman.  There were some amusing scenes when Matthew and Corrine were trying to get together and everything went wrong.  The problem I had with this book is that I didn't like Corrine.  She was to self-centered and I couldn't see any reason that Matthew would love her.  She was very condescending toward Matthew for most of the book.  The book is OK but I can't highly recommend it.	2003-11-05

At 18, Jodie loses her parents in an accident while they are on vacation.  Margie's big brother, Alex, steps in to help Jodie.  Since then, Jodie has been spending vacations and holidays with Margie and Alex.  Jodie has a huge crush on Alex but tries to hide it, but does a very poor job of it.  Alex is aware of Jodie's crush and tries to discourage it.  When Jodie overhears Alex telling Margie that's he tired of Jodie always being around, Jodie finally decides to distance herself from Margie and Alex.  As soon as Alex realizes that Jodie is distancing herself from him, he tires to win her back.<br />I'm not a big Diane Palmer fan.  At times I feel her heroes are cruel, especially in her older work.  I thought I'd give Ms. Palmer's book another try because this one looked interesting.  At the beginning of the book, Alex was a very harsh to Jodie but then more than made up for it later in the book.  I'm glad I gave it a try.  The change in Jodie during the course of the book was wonderful.	2003-11-05

I know, a lot of marriages fail these days and nobody moves four states away, but Belinda didn't even get the marriage certificate signed!  So far, the start over is not going to well.  Belinda has no couch, only one lonely living room chair and a TV that only gets reception when it's raining.  The closest male relationship she's made since moving to Atlanta is with the voice of the helicopter traffic reporter she listens to on the way to and from work.  Could things get any bleaker?  What do you think?<br />When asked to join a car pool with three other women from Archer Furniture, Belinda accepts.   On her first day in the car pool, Belinda is recruited to drive in the nightmare Atlanta traffic.  Running tight for a very important meeting, Belinda is worried about not making it to work on time.  When she takes her eyes off the road for a second, she promptly plows into a police cruiser (oops) driven by Lieutenant Wade Alexander (aka Lieutenant Goodbody).  The wreck flattens a tire, breaks out a headlight and does major body damage, including breaking the latch on her trunk.  When she finally makes it to work, Belinda's boss, Margo, is on the warpath and dresses Belinda down within earshot of her co-workers.  Belinda snaps and tells Margo that if she's going to be treated like that she needs a raise.  Margo corners Belinda in private and lets her know that she was impressed with Belinda's backbone and if Belinda will help her push through a merger with another company, Margo will make her CFO of the company.  Belinda knows going along with this deal is wrong because she suspects some creative accounting but is too tempted by the promotion.  Margo is a real witch and has alienated just about everyone who knows her.  When her dead body ends up in the trunk of Belinda car, Belinda and her car pool buddies find themselves having to prove their innocence.<br />The characters in this book are great.  The car pool buddies are wonderful.   There's a good dose of the humor that I love in Ms. Bond's books along with a little more mystery.  You got to read this one.	2003-11-05

Since most of the models have come in costume, when a very sexy telephone repairman walks through the door, Swan thinks he's another model with stage freight and helps him to shed his clothes.  Only when the pants come down and he's not wearing a pair of her underwear (or any underwear for that matter) does she realize this is really a telephone repairman.  The story only gets better from there.<br />The repairman is actually Rob Gaines an FBI agent who is trying to gather information in a five million dollar embezzlement case.  Swan of course is an innocent dupe in the whole embezzlement.  The loan officer who gave Swan and her partner a loan to keep their business afloat, hid a cashiers check in an organizer he gave Swan as a gift.  Rather than go to jail, Swan agrees to let her three-store fashion tour be used to smoke out the loan officer's accomplice.  The only problem is that without the loan (which was also fake), there is no money to pay models for the tour.  Swan convinces her assistant Gerard, Rob and Rob's partner Joe to model for her.  The resulting fashion show is a riot.<br />The sexual tension between Swan and Rob sizzles.  Comic relief is provided by Rob's partner Joe and Swan's assistant Gerard.	2003-09-20

Twenty-six years ago, Caleb and Carol Crawford separated.  During this time, Caleb had an affair.  He told Carol about the affair and she forgave him but he did not tell her that the affair resulted in a son.  Now all these years later, a very pregnant young woman, Georgie Brown, turns up at the Crawford's front door.  Georgie is pregnant by Caleb's illegitimate son, Cal.  Before the two could marry, Cal and his mother are killed in an auto accident.  Now, with barely a minimum wage job and no insurance, Georgie is hoping for assistance from Cal's father.  Although she is furious with her husband for lying to her all these years, the very big-hearted Carol Crawford takes Georgie into her home until after her baby is born.  Georgie sees the problems she is causing to Caleb and Carol and tries several times to leave.<br />This is a well written story about mistakes people make in their marriages and a couple who tries very hard to overcome the hurt caused by these mistakes instead of just giving up.  I think this is one of Christenberry's finest books.  Caleb is flawed but he is a good man struggling to keep his pride in tact and save his marriage.  Carol and Georgie are kind, generous women who are dedicated to family.  The romance that blossoms between Georgie and Rick, Carol and Caleb's son, is heartwarming.  If you're a Christenberry fan, you'll love this book, if not, you'll become one.	2003-09-18

As soon as she graduated high school, Emma headed to Washington, DC for college and later her career.  She has however remained close to her family via phone calls and occasional visits.  When her kid brother calls her begging her to come home because their father is acting strangely, Emma doesn't believe it's as bad as he says.  Two days later, Emma gets a call in the middle of the night that her father is dead.<br />When Emma returns home, she finds her mother in denial about her husband's death and refusing to get out of bed, her middle brother is trying to dull his problems with drugs and her youngest brother mad because Emma did not come home when he asked her to.  Although the coroner rules the death an accident, Emma suspects it's suicide based on her brother's phone call.  Matters get further complicated when her father's will is read and it's discovered that he not only spent all the family money but has heavily mortgaged the house and the family diner.  Emma asks her childhood friend, Matt Atkins, who is now chief of police, to help her find out what really happened to her father so she can have closure.  In order to save her family, Emma quits her DC job and stays in Winter Cove to run the diner.<br />This was a very interesting story.  Woods did a good job of developing her characters.  I felt the anguish of the characters as they came to grips with the suicide of their father/husband.  Matt was a great male lead.  Emma was a very strong female lead but her obsession with having to return to DC, even when she realized she liked being back in Winter Cove, was irritating after awhile.  Overall, this book is worth reading.	2003-09-18

The girls knew Eric would resist the matchmaking forcing Tessa and Eric to spend a lot of time together.  What the girls didn't know is that Tessa and Eric had slept together before she left town years ago and the two parted on very bad terms.<br />This book was great.  Tessa and Eric are both strong characters.  The supporting cast is very well developed.  I really felt I got to know the whole quirky cast.	2003-09-10

On her way to cry on her mother's shoulder, Christy is abducted by mob goons and told if she doesn't do one \\"favor\\" for the mob, she and her mother and sisters will be killed.  Christy is to take a suitcase to Ocracoke Island, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and wait for instructions.<br />Luke Rand has been tracking the Philadelphia mob for years and has had an eye on Christy since she started getting friendly with DePalma.  With a sealed indictment about to handed down against DePalma, DePalma disappears and Luke follows Christy to Ocracoke Island thinking that DePalma will show up to pick up his fiance.  <br />After delivering the suitcase as instructed at 1:00 in the morning, Christy is hurrying home along the beach when her sixth sense tells her she's being followed by someone wanting to do her evil.  As she runs to get away from whoever is following her, she trips over a woman who is barely alive.  Christy runs screaming for her cottage and runs smack into Luke who is exiting her house after planting a bug.

The longer Luke is around Christy, he slowly comes to realize that she is being forced to aid the mob and he begins to fall in love with her.<br />This is a great book.  The romance between Luke and Christy was fun to watch develop.  The two story lines about the mob and possible serial killer were interesting.  I can usually figure out who the bad guy is pretty early in this type of story but I have to admit, I was blown away when the killer was revealed.	2003-08-29

I'd just like to tell you that the characters are very well developed.  Emma is a very believable character, she could be your best freind who has been going through rough times.

She hadn't counted on her uncle putting her in a masked tigress outfit and sending her into the ring when one of the female wrestlers didn't show up.  World champion wrestler Black Jack Hudson wanted out of wrestling, not a new female partner.  He's sure he can scare off the timid woman in the tiger outfit but from their first match together when the tigress hits him over the head by mistake (she was aiming for his opponent) and knocks him out, Jack is fascinated by his partner.  The problem is, Jack is also fascinated by the boss' uptight niece Frankie.<br />I'm not a pro wrestling fan but I liked this book a lot.  It was interesting to watch the two sides of Frankie's personality.  Jack was a very sexy and sympathetic hero who had real depth.  There were a lot of funny scenes in the book, as you can image with this unique setting.  Don't let the pro wrestling venue scare you off.  This book is very good.	2003-08-28

That book was so great that I had to track down Luc and Sylvie's story, The Love Potion.<br />Sylvie Fontaine grew up in a family of wealthy, overachieving, Creole women.  It was not an easy childhood for a painfully shy girl.  Luc LeDeux grew up in an abusive, poor, Cajun household.  Since childhood, Luc perceived Sylvie as a snob and Sylvie perceived Luc as the baddest boy in town.<br />As an adult, Sylvie works as a chemist.  She's currently working on a love potion, which she packages in jellybeans.  Luc is now a lawyer who is helping a group of shrimp fishermen, led by his brother Rene, fight a big oil company (which Luc's father is a major shareholder for).  Luc brings a water sample to Sylvie's lab and asks that she analyze it for petroleum contamination.  While Sylvie's back is turned, Luc eats about half of the love potion jellybeans.  When a reporter overhears part of a conversation between Sylvie and Luc and then pries the rest out of Sylvie's best friend, he goes front page with the story.  Sylvie and Luc start running when bullets start flying.  Luc tries desperately to fight the affects of the love potion, but why is Sylvie feeling just as attracted when she didn't take any of the love potion?<br />This is a great story.  There is plenty of romance and action and a good dose of Luc's hilarious family.  I'm glad I tracked it down.	2003-07-20

Sam came after Archie to try to persuade his father to go home.  Soon, Lilli and Sam set out on their own road trip to find Lillian and Archie.  A couple of pairs of sinister gangsters are thrown in to spice things up.<br />This book provided two romances to follow, between Lilli and Sam and between Lillian and Archie.  It was nice that the elder characters romance was hotter than the younger couples for a change. The murderer was easy to figure out early in the story but that's ok because this is a romance not a mystery.  The mystery was used as an excuse to get the two main couples alone together in tight spaces for long periods of time and to put Lilli into perilous situations.

At 16, her parents were killed in an auto accident.  After their deaths, they were accused of stealing money from the church.  The \\"good\\" people of the town that Hope had always considered her friends turned their backs on her.  Hope and her two sisters and foster brother were ripped away from each other and sent to different parts of the country to live with no word where the others were.  Seven year's later; Hope's biggest goal in life is to find her brother and sisters.  Hope has forsaken a personal life to work long hours as a operator at an answering service and go to school so she can get a high paying job when she graduates and find her family.<br />Zach Givens was born wealthy.  Early in life he learned a hard lesson about people only befriending him for his money.  Although he could live off his family wealth, Zach is dedicated to the family business, Givens Enterprises.  He is somewhat of a corporate raider who is ruthless.  Zach is also a technophobe.  When his secretary goes on an extended vacation, she sets Zach up with the only answering service left in Boston, the same one Hope works at.<br />From her dealings with the wealthy townspeople who turned their backs on her, Hope has preconceived notions about rich people so she assumes Zach Givens is an arrogant jerk.  When the caller ID at the answering service reveals that the Givens residence is calling to pick up messages, Hope assumes she is talking to the butler, Griswold, because the great Mr. Givens would never stoop to picking up his own messages.  Zach is however on the other end of the phone.  Although initially offended by Hopes rude comments about himself, he quickly warms to her sexy voice and charming manner so he lets her keep thinking he's Griswold.  Hope really cares about the people who call into the answering service and her goodness comes through.  When Hope brings Zach/Griswold chicken soup when he's sick and the two see each other for the first time, Zach knows he has to have Hope for his own.<br />I thought the story was very interesting and well written.  Zach was a good romantic hero even though he was a bit to overbearing at times for my taste.  Hope was the perfect heroine of the story, she was not overly pretty like so many romantic heroines but because of her personality she was the most beautiful woman Zach had ever known.  With the relationship between the two main characters starting out just talking over the phone, they were able to develop a relationship based on the inner person before looks got involved.	2003-06-27

During her brief time at the party, Carlie catches the eye of Bren's brother-in-law, the devastatingly handsome Tyler Ramsay.  Although he's seen her many times, Tyler does not recognize Carlie with her dark wig, colored contact lenses and veil.  Tyler follows the mysterious harem girl to the pool house where they make hot (and I mean really hot) love.  When Tyler dozes off, Carlie sneaks off determined that Tyler would never know it was her.<br />When Carlie stops by Bren's to square up details of Bren's husband, Jason, helping with an after school recreation program, she learns that Jason had something come up and his brother Tyler is going help Carlie instead.  Carlie is determined to keep Tyler at arms length so he won't recognize her as the mysterious harem girl.  Although he's never given Carlie more than a passing glance in the past, working closely with her on the after school program, he quickly learns that she is unlike any other woman he's ever met.  Instead of throwing herself at him, she seems to want to keep him at a distance.  He also discovers that she is smart and funny.  Soon, he's less determined to find his harem girl and more determined to get Carlie to want to spend more time with him. <br />I really liked this book.  Carlie was a very sympathic heroine.  Her ex-husband did a major mind job on her and totally destroyed her self-confidence to the point that she had to hide who she really was behind her old maid clothes or the harem girl costume.  Although rich, handsome and able to attack any woman he wants (and plenty he doesn't), Tyler is bored and dissatisfied until he gets to know Carlie better.

When C.J. goes into labor at her desk one night chasing down leads and Warrick is the only one there to deliver the baby, their relationship begins to shift.  Although both Warrick and C.J. had entertained romantic thoughts about the other in the past, neither had acted upon them.  Now, as they are thrown more and more together, the sparks get hotter and hotter and harder and harder to ignore.<br />The characters were very good.  I liked the serial killer story behind the romance.  Well worth reading.	2003-05-27

Regina Foxworth is a reporter who feels someone is out to get her but the police keep telling her that the series of strange incidents that have been happening to her lately are just coincidence.  Not convinced, Regina asks Riley to teach her self-defense.  Riley immediately falls for Regina and is determined to protect her.  <br />Lori Foster has a knack for writing heroes who are strong, dependable and incredibly sexy and Riley definitely fits the bill.  Regina is very frou-frou but still a likeable character.  Riley's group of buddies are great, I cannot wait for Harris and Butch's stories.  Foster writes buddy scenes better than anyone.  There is a lot of humor in this book, especially with the guard dog that Regina buys (it reminded me a lot of Jennifer Cruise's dogs).	2003-05-27

Mabel, Florence and the gang are up to their old matchmaking tricks.<br />When her cousin died, Suzanne McCoy, a big city girl, became guardian of two small children and a ranch in Cactus, Texas.  Suzanne is determined to keep the ranch afloat so the children will have their inheritance when they grow up.  When she overhears the ranch foreman and hired hands discussing how they had already stolen from the ranch and were planning on taking more, Suzanne's temper flares to the point she gives them all fifteen minutes to get off the ranch.  Knowing nothing about running a ranch, Suzanne seeks advice from the residence of Cactus, Texas.  Everyone she talks to tells her the same thing; the person to talk to is Ryan Walker.  Mabel Baxter goes so far as to tell her the solution is for her to marry Ryan.<br />Ryan Walker's wife left him three years ago after giving birth to their daughter, Beth.  Now that Beth is getting bigger, Ryan can no longer carry her everywhere he goes so he has to take her into town everyday to a sitter.  When the sitter is offered a better paying job, Ryan decides he needs to hire a housekeeper.  In step the meddling matchmakers.  They convince everyone to go along with their plan to get Suzanne and Ryan hitched so there are no hired hands or housekeepers around to be hired.  Suzanne thinks it would be a good trade for her to be Ryan's housekeeper and he and his staff work her ranch but Ryan is worried that Suzanne will marry some other guy and he'd just be back in the same boat.  Ryan is convinced that a marriage of convenience is what would work best so he convinces Suzanne.  When Ryan's ex-wife comes back and tries to take Beth, Ryan and Suzanne join forces and soon they become a family.<br />The story moved along very nicely.  Ryan and Suzanne were both great characters who are trying to do the best they can for the children in their lives.  I liked the way the children were portrayed in this book.  They were fairly main characters in the book and they were believable and very sweet.  The speed with which the \\"matchmakers\\" decided on a pairing of Ryan and Suzanne was totally unbelievable but it did not detract from the story, it just allowed more time for the development of the relationship between the main characters.	2003-05-16

In need of money to buy out another antique shop, Amos agreed to pick up `special' shipments of antiques in San Francisco and hold specially marked items for individuals who give him a secret password.  Amos has tried to quit this business but the people he's working for have threatened his life if he tries to get out.  <br />Lynne Montgomery owns a travel agency and has set up a special tour of the California Gold Rush Country for a group of schoolteachers.  Lynne is acting as the tour guide and has a friendship with most of the teachers.  On the way to the rendezvous point, Lynne develops van trouble and stops at a gas station along the highway.  While the van is being worked on, she and her friend Betsy go into a Ledbetter Antiques, which is being manned by Amos' niece.  Betsy buys a lamp like one her grandmother used to own.  When Amos returns to the shop, he's frantic.  The lamp was being held for his special buyer.  Before Amos can locate Lynne and Betsy and get the lamp back, the buyer shows up and insists on going with Amos.  Amos goes chasing after Lynn and Betsy, sometimes with the disreputable people he works with, in order to get the lamp back.<br />There were only two mysteries about this book:  what was in the lamp, and why I kept reading it.  This book was very slow.   The back of the book states \\"they love roughing it at the Murmuring Pines Campground-until a mysterious accident leaves the campground's owner near death.  When it becomes clear that someone is bent on making this Lynne's final tour, she must dig up some clues and catch the culprit\\".   The accident doesn't happen until page 75, Lynne doesn't realize that the string of bad luck the group is having is related to the accident and that it's connected to the lamp until page 277 (although this fact is not kept from the reader) and she never does go searching for clues.  The book spent way to much time going into each characters' background which wasn't necessary for the story and read more like a travel guide/history lesson for Gold Rush Country than a mystery.	2003-05-06

She is also determined to heal Lucas' soul so they can have a life together.  Lucas fights very hard to keep his distance from Maggie but quickly learns that she is much more than the surface image everyone sees.  He finds it harder and harder to resist her charms. <br />Sheri Whitefeather  had done a good job of entwining Lucas and Maggie's romance with the mystery of what's happening in Altaria but it's her characters that really set her book apart.  Being the 12th book in the Connelly series, this book does not dwell as much on developing the Connelly clan but on the people in Lucas' life.  Lucas' mother is a very sympathetic character who is still struggling to deal with her daughter's murder all those years ago.  I especially liked the bodyguard that Lucas got for Maggie.  He's one of the most entertaining characters in the book.	2003-04-22

When I finally read it, I was disappointed because I don't feel that it's up to Christenberry's standards.  <br />Nick Avery is a rich, handsome, sexy businessman.  He's been married to Andrea for six months.  During their marriage, Nick works later and later trying to avoid having to talk with Andrea.  Although he lavishes her with things, he only comes home to sleep with her.  After six months, Andrea realizes she doesn't really know Nick.  She does know, however, that he never wants to be a father.  Having grown up an orphan in foster homes, Andrea wants children more than anything.  When she finds out she's pregnant, she leaves Nick rather than have her child grow up with a father that doesn't love it.  <br />Nick and Andrea both rush to see Nick's Aunt Bess during a terrible storm.  Aunt Bess turns out not to be at home and Nick and Andrea get stuck together for several days.  During this time, Nick keeps asking why Andrea won't come back to him.  He accuses her of all sorts of dastardly deeds.  For her part, Andrea won't just tell Nick she's pregnant.  It takes way to long to resolve things, the last 10 pages of the book, and get to rebuilding the relationship.	2003-04-11

Dev offers again to buy her out if money becomes a problem and for the first time Amanda says she'll consider it depending on what she learns from Child Services about custody.

Prior to the start of Faking It, Clea seduces Davy's financial manager into helping her steal it back along with the $2 million Davy made investing it.  Determined to find Clea's bank codes so he can get his money back, Davy breaks into Clea's room to access her lap top computer.<br />Tilda Goodnight is a semi-famous mural artist who comes from a long line of art forgers.  During her youth, Tilda painted six pictures she signed Scarlet, short for Scarlet Hodge.  The only trouble is Scarlet Hodge is supposed to be the daughter of famous folk artist Homer Hodge but Scarlet only existed in the imagination of Tilda's father.  While watching the Goodnight family art gallery one day, Tilda's niece sells a Scarlet that the rest of the family didn't know still exists to Clea Lewis.  Tilda is afraid that if anyone gets to close a look at this Scarlet, they will discover it is a fraud because it's content is not consistent with the rest of the Scarlets and then people will start looking into the other art work they purchased from Goodnight Gallery.  To save her family's reputation and livelihood, Tilda breaks into Clea Lewis's room to steal back the Scarlet.<br />The minute Tilda and Davy meet up in Clea's closet and share a passionate kiss, we are treated to a great story as Tilda and Davy set out to retrieve all six Scarlets.

There's Tilda's sister Eve who is a straight-laced schoolteacher by day who has a second personality, slutty Louise that only comes out on Wednesday thru Sunday nights.  The love of Eve's life is her ex-husband Andrew who came out of the closet a couple of years back.  Eve and Andrew's daughter Nadine dates boys based on what career they can help her try on for size.  Tilda's mother Gwen spends her days doing crossword puzzles and dreaming of running away to someplace sunny while listening to golden oldies on the jukebox.  Oh, I almost forgot, there's also a sexy hit man, an FBI agent, a lovesick accountant, a master thief, an albino artist and we meet Davy's father Michael who taught Davy everything he knows about the con game.<br />I highly recommend you read Faking It.  You won't be disappointed.	2003-04-10

Sam had two hunky guys vying for her affection.  Sam goes through designer outfits faster than Stephanie goes through cars.  It was very funny and action packed.  Sam kept finding herself in all kinds of messes she had to get herself out of.  Gabe was a wonderful character who helped Sam learn what she needed to survive.	2003-04-02

In the dark, Callie and Dominic confess their desires and insecurities to each other and then Dominic takes Callie on sensual ride through her fantasies.<br />The first two stories in this book are fantastic and well worth buying the book.

The intertwining plot lines of the kidnapping of Zach's sister and<BR>her fianc and the Colombian out for revenge against Zach were well written and kept my attention.  The main characters, Zach and Lilly, were both likable enough although Zach was to quick jump to conclusions (just because Lilly was renting a room from his sister, Zach assumed she was a con artist out to swindle his sister out of her inheritance).  Lilly was a strong female lead who knew she could correct Zach's misassumption if she wanted<BR>to but she had the self confidence to let him think what he wanted to.  The extent that Lilly went to not to swear did wear a little thin after awhile and is probably my only real complaint with the book.  When the two finally got together, as with all of Susan Andersen's books, the relationship sizzled.  Overall, a good book, well worth the read.	2003-03-01
