Robin could have said no to Keefer about robbing the grocery store she was working at.  She could have concentrated on the co-workers who were kind to her.  It was wrong of Teal to take the SUV when her dad said no.  She shouldn't have even thought about the shoplifting game.  Instead of taking without paying WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE MORE MONEY!!!!  That is what I had read from a young lady in the Parade section of Sunday's paper of the Quad City Times.  Here are some ways you can go about getting what you want:  you can do some chores for somebody else or you can try to get a job in the community.  I am sorry that Phoebe didn't have her aunt and her uncle listen to her when she needed their help.  She could have worked more with her teacher.  Running away wasn't the answer.  She could have told her teacher on the following Monday what had happened.  I am sure he would have believed her when she said she acted in self defense when Ashley and his cronies attacked her.	2004-06-02

Cinnamon did a beautiful job performing on stage.  I think she deserved to get the last laugh on the girls who resented her for taking the lead role.  Ice got what she wanted a chance to be herself.  She made friends with a piano player.  Rose was grieved when her dad died.  She felt better about herself when she helped Evan get out and meet people.  Honey liked to play the violin which her uncle Peter taught her to play.  She enjoyed having a good relationship with Chandler.	2004-05-24

I feel tempted to hide whenever the pressure is too much.  I didn't blame Grace for  mistrusting her fellow students in the private high school Winston enrolled her in.  Jackie was too wrapped up in the wealth she married into.  I believe Jackie needed a very rude awakening when Grace told her that Kirby assaulted her (G).  I believe Grace found strength in loving her son Linden.  Unfortunately Jackie wouldn't let her (G) be the mom she (G) wanted to be to Linden.  I am sure that made her feel more upset.	2004-03-31

Kenneth told Melody that he and his dad Nelson tried to help her mom Haille make good choices.  Kenneth was disappointed that Haille didn't listen to him.  I am sure even Samuel wanted Haille to be successful too.  Jacob and Olivia had no right to be blaming Melody for their problems with Haille.  I was glad when Melody stood up to Jacob and Olivia.  Somebody had to.  Jacob and Olivia was stressing everybody around them out.  Cary needed every hug Melody gave him.  It must have made Cary feel better when he knew he didn't have to face his problems alone.  When I read about Melody, her character reminded me of a college buddy I have who is a Scott County sheriff's deputy.  I hope if my buddy is reading this, he will consider talking with me about the books of my favorite author VC Andrews.  Those books could help him with his work while he's questioning others. I could use more time meeting with people like Melody.  People like Melody help people who are in most need of help.	2004-02-28

Star and Rodney were lucky to move in with their grandma.  I was glad she fell in love with Steve.  I believe Star should have told her grandma about Steve's problems while he was alive.  That way Steve's life would have been saved.  Star took it very hard when Steve died.  Yet her grandma didn't panic when she found out when her own granddaughter needed help.	2004-02-05

As for Stuart, his big loss when he didn't come around after all things came out.  I was glad when Dr. Marlowe got custody of Cat.  I hope to hear a story about Cat's college adventures.	2004-02-01

Heaven wanted to have a good relationship with Luke, whom she had known as her dad when she was little.  Shortly after she got reacquainted with Drake Heaven discovered this ugly fact:  Tony had forbidden Luke to have any contact with her. I would be very angry if somebody told anybody I wanted to hear from not to ever speak to me at all.  What's worse was Tony assaulted Heaven again.  Fanny did stoop low to try to turn Drake against Heaven.  The truth eventually came out when it came to the hearing about Drake's custody.  Fanny needed to learn the hard way that a relationship shouldn't be started with lies.  I believe that Heaven is a more competent guardian for Drake than Fanny would be.	2004-01-29

What helps her is that she is willing to give people a chance.  It was shocking that Howard assaults Cat after she trusts him.	2003-12-27

The kids had to rely on their creativity to make something out of nothing.  When you have nothing, all you can do is to make something out of nothing.  As for Corinne, I was totally disgusted with her.  She could have stood up for her kids and herself at some point if she had any gumption to do anything.  For instance she could have looked up her childhood buddies and asked them for help to get the kids away from the attic and into school ASAP.  Cory had a right to live.  He didn't deserve to be poisoned at all.  Neither did the other children.  Chris, Jr. was very smart.  He helped Cathy save her hair when Olivia put tar in it.  He even made a wooden key.  That is how Chris, Cathy and Carrie got out of the attic.	2003-11-10

She is wise because she always takes time to listen to everybody around her.  Summer even wants to help Harley get into college.  Austin gives Summer wise counsel to help herself before she helps anybody else.  I believe he means to say, &quot;When oxygen masks drop put yours on first before you help anybody else with his or her mask.&quot;  I heard that statement quoted by Eustace Cutler, the mom of Temple Grandin.

Cindy was scared to death of Bart when he threatened her.  Cindy needed to be reminded that she could trust Chris and Cathy and Jory.

It was worse when she discovered she couldn't walk.  It hadn't helped matters that the nurse assigned to her was apathetic.  To top it all off, Tony isolated her from Luke Jr. and everybody else in her life.  I was glad when Annie met her birth dad Troy.  It was quite a shock for Annie that Tony by mistake thought that she was Leigh.  In a way Leigh was practically with Annie in spirit.	2003-07-15

In fact, I had written an anonymous review at one time on one of the other VC Andrews's books in the past year. Can anybody guess which book it was? In fact can anybody guess who I am? I don't think it is fair that people with disabilities are forbidden to marry on account of what their limitations are. I even told my mom so, but she said I should accept it. I AM SO MAD! If it hadn't been for any friends I have had especially from high school or college, I just don't know what I would have done. Talking about how I feel makes me feel better so I don't have it eating at me. As for the story, I was disgusted with Olivia for bullying her family. Samuel should have stood up to his wife a long time ago. That way less hurt would have gone on very long.    PS  It doesn't help that I have been having trouble finding work since May 2004.  I think it is because the employers of my residential town as well as surrounding cities just want to hire people who were more popular than I was in school.  Then my unemployment is taking a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend.  If he gives up on me, it will be all the fault of voc rehab which is making me remember every horrible day I had had in school.	2003-05-29

Audrina believed she had a namesake named Audrina.  But then she remembered the most horrible moment of her life.  She actually had her ninth birthday and some mean boys assaulted her.  It was the ugliest thing Vera did to set Audrina to be attacked.  I believe the worst part about it was nobody should have to be afraid to go to school.

For instance, Lillian \\"Grandmother\\" Cutler framed Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp for kidnapping Dawn.  I presume Lillian thought people should suffer because she thought there was nobody she could turn to when she was a child.  Laura Sue was truly a coward for not standing up for Dawn when Lillian degraded her (D).  Clara Sue was horrible by making trouble for Dawn and Jimmy at Emerson Peabody.  What was more is Clara Sue framed her for taking a necklace.  To top it all off she had Jimmy turned to the police after she promised to give him a safe haven.  I was glad when Sissy, Dawn's co-worker, came around to befriend her.  Sissy even pointed out where to find Mrs. Lila Dalton who was Dawn's nurse.  Mrs. Dalton helped Dawn a lot to tell what she knew.	2003-05-13

During my last year in college I had problems with my peers.  Without taking my side of the story into consideration, the dean of students booted me out of the residence halls.  He said I should just \\"bag it\\" if I was upset with anybody at all.  He even said that nobody would want to be friends with me if I couldn't control my emotions.  It's hard for anybody to control how he or she feels if he or she is being disliked without a just cause.  I didn't deserve to be snubbed at all.  This novel was the very first VC Andrews book I read.  Ever since I could relate to the feeling of Ruby and the main characters of the novels I have been attached to the VC novels.	2003-05-06

Garland was a real man when he didn't let the fact that his first wife Corinne dump him ruin his life.  In fact he found the courage to love again when he helped Alicia when her own daddy was in poor health.

No matter how hard she tried not to think about those days some unfortunate circumstances make the bad memories haunt her. Dawn tries to teach Fern about appropriate conduct, but Fern has been refusing to listen. Clara Sue had been making a big pest of herself. She had no business calling Christie names or kidnapping her from the hotel. If I had been in Dawn's shoes, I would have pressed charges against Clara Sue when I had the chance.

Like DARKEST HOUR, it shows what happens when people fail to listen to each other.  It was bad enough that the people whom Leigh knew as her parents divorced.  Leigh was shocked to know that a man named Chester was her birth father instead of Cleave.  It was slimy of Cleave to bail out on Leigh when she needed his help the most.  It was beastly of Tony to assault Leigh.  What was worse she became pregnant.  To top it all off Leigh's mom Jillian refused to listen to her (L)!  A CAT'S A BETTER MOTHER THAN JILLIAN!  It was noble of Luke to take Leigh in, but Luke should have brought Leigh to the right authorities.  That way Leigh would have survived giving birth to Heaven.	2003-03-18

For your information NOBODY ever deserves the degradation that Dawn received from Emily!  I would NEVER want to wish that on MY OWN WORST ENEMY. I do commend Dawn for sticking up for her own daughter Christie.  Dawn's birth mom Laura NEVER stuck her neck out one fraction of an inch for her (D).  One day when my boyfriend Casey was concerned about my hair being in tangles, I told him about a worse hair scenario of Dawn's hair having neither a comb nor a brush through her hair while she was at the Meadows.  He agreed with me that just because Dawn was pregnant out of wedlock it didn't mean it was reason enough for Emily to degrade her (i.e.  making Dawn trade in the clothes on her back for a potato sack and yelling at her non-stop).  He even said he wouldn't wish that on his own worst enemy either.	2002-12-27

So did the rest of the family.  Jean was so funny.  Even though Jean had pulled the practical joke with Pearl's graduation cap, his parents couldn't stay mad at him very long.  I thought it was good that Pearl got firm with her dad Beau when he was drinking too heavily when her mom Ruby was missing.  I was glad for Pearl when she met Jack Clovis, a man whom she could trust.  I would like to hear another story from Pearl when she finished college and succeeds in medical school.  I believe Ruby and Beau are right to insist that Pearl fulfills her potential.	2002-10-31

I think they had problems because there was nobody to speak up for them while they were students. I could relate to them because my boyfriend and I want to tie the knot but the policy of his dad's company says that people who receive special services are not to marry to qualify for services. I think it is unfair! Fortunately, though after a temp layoff from March to August 2003, I was relieved to go back to work.  I started work again on August 5, 2003.  Recently I started a part time job which was offered by a friend when I was downsized out of PSS.  However the project ended.  But I was glad to hear about a temp assignment.  I hope the temp assignment will eventually help me get a permanent job.    Update:  I am starting a new job on June 12, 2006.

It made matters worse when Melanie and Richard caused trouble for Christie and Jefferson.  What's more was Bet wouldn't listen to either Christie or Jefferson.
