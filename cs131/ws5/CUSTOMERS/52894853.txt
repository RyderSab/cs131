People who are aware that they cannot fully understand complex problems often believe that there are other people, more intelligent, knowledgeable and strong than they are, who do posses the answers to these problems. They are quite prepared to follow and depend on these leaders, people who do seem and or pretend to know the answers to pressing complex problems. But is this wise? No!<br />James Surowiecki fights the idea that group decisions can only be mad and lead to misery and that extraordinary individuals should therefore solve pressing problems. He says that the potential of groups is underestimated and the value of expertise overestimed:<br /><br />\\"... the more power you give a single individual in the face of complexity and uncertainty, the more likely it is that bad decisions will get made\\".<br /><br />If the circumstances are right groups can behave highly intelligent, often more intelligent than even the most intelligent individuals. Under those circumstances, groups are better at solving problems, making predictions, assessing situations accurately and deciding wisely.<br /><br />The right circumstances for collective wisdom are:<br /><br />1. Diversity: when arguments, views and opinions do not differ from each other they don't add anything to one another. Diversity guarantees that multiple perspectives are brought into the decision-making process and that a broader range of information is included.<br /><br />2. Independence: when individual group members are strongly influenced by arguments, information, experiences and onions of others this will suppress the diversity of input into the decision-making process. This increases the likelihood of groupthink.<br /><br />3. Decentralization: the chance to achieve collective wisdom is greatest when individuals get a chance to bring their own information and experience into the process. Surowiecki calls this `local experience'.<br /><br />4. Aggregation: a mechanism and a process to come to an integration of the different views and opinions. It is very important to prevent there will be too much interaction before each other to strongly so that the pressure to conform may get too strong and any deviating opinions will be suppressed.<br /><br />An intelligent group does not ask of its individual members to conform to the dominant view. Instead it has created a mechanism that resembles a democracy or a market. Individual group members get the opportunity to bring in their own information and opinions and are not forced to change their views. Their independence is explicitly protected.<br /><br />I found this book very interesting and accessible.4.

US	52894853	RXYN785M79I3S	1586482610	322421618	The Case For Democracy	Books	4	13	17	N	Y	Democracy, human rights and peace	When I bought this book I had not really looked well who wrote it. The title suggested it was just the book I'd been looking for for sometime. I had noticed for some time that people frequently talk about democracy as if it were an end in itself. Things are called `right' because they are democratic and `wrong' because they're not democratic. But surely democracy is not an end in itself. Why democracy? What good does it bring? Are democratic countries really better off than non-democratic ones? And if so, in what ways? And for whom is it better?<br /><br />As I started reading the book I realized who the author is: former USSR-dissident Sharansky who is now an Israeli politician who appears to have some influence on the current US diplomacy. This made me a bit cautious while reading: is this book really independent or just intended as a justification of Israeli and US policies? I have tried to carefully follow and consider the line of reasoning. Basically, this is what the author says:<br /><br />1. DEMOCRACY CREATES A TENDENCY TOWARDS PEACE, TRYANNY CREATES A TENDENCY TOWARDS WAR<br />The core proposition of the book is that promoting peace and security is fundamentally connected to promoting freedom and democracy. The author says the mechanics of democracy will always make a democratic country develop a tendency towards peace. Whereas a minority of individuals will prefer war to peace, a majority will never do so. They will tend to choose peace, stability, and security. And because democratic leaders know they depend on the people they cannot consistently ignore this drive towards peace. Non-democratic leaders create fear and control and do not depend on the people's whish. The thread of war will often be a desirable thing for dictators. By creating external enemies they have a legitimation to enforce loyalty and get rid of regime opposers. This makes (the thread of) war attractive to them.<br /><br />2. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD CONSISTENTLY PRESS FOR WORLDWIDE DEMOCRACY<br />A second core proposition is that democratic countries need to press for democratic reform in non-democratic countries. While some argue that democracy can't be created from the outside (making it 'artifical') the author gives convincing examples of how democracy has been successfully been established under outside pressure to the benefit of people. The author himself witnessed firsthand how the US successfully pressed for democracy in the USSR. But an even more impressive example may be Germany. Who would have believed around 1940 that Germany would be a blossoming democracy within 15 years? Saying that a democracy cannot be established without outside help sounds to me like saying the police should not interfere when a man is molesting and terrorizing his family. It sounds like saying: \\"Oh, no let's not interfere, at least he is not harming the neighbors. If that family truly wants to be more free and equal they have to establish that for themselves. Maybe the wife and kids are not the kind of people who want to be free?\\" While this sounds absurd on this level, we do it all the time when it concerns states.<br /><br />3. ALL PEOPLES DESERVE DEMOCRACY<br />A third proposition is that all peoples deserve to be free and are potentially capable of democratic self-rule. Sometimes people claim that democracy is a Western invention that will never take hold in certain parts of the world because it would contradict the culture of the people involved. The author successfully defies this logic by showing how democracy has spread and is still spreading throughout the world, including in `improbable' places like Japan, South America, and Russia. Saying that some people are better off without freedom and democracy reminds of how many people once justified slavery, apartheid and so on.<br /><br />If the author is right (and I tend to think he is) this would have great implications for international diplomacy. The dominant trend in diplomacy has been to prefer stability over pressing for democracy and social reform. There is a strong belief that it is wise to support strong leaders who control their angry peoples firmly so that there will be at least some level of stability. The author turns this logic upside down: he says the tendency towards war begins with tyranny; the remedy is freedom and democracy, not the other way around. By saying this, the author is not only criticizing the laissez faire attitude of the United Nations but certainly too the diplomacy by Israel and the US. Only very recently the US seem to have embraced the line of thinking of Sharansky.<br /><br />If the author is right, promoting democracy serves two goals at once: it serves human rights of individuals and enhances international stability and peace. I guess he is quite right. This does not mean that war will be needed and is always justified agains tyrannies. On the contrary! The more consistently and unanimously the UN will manage to press for democracy, the more non-violent means will be sufficient so that many wars can be prevented. Having said that, I want to add that we should not only point the finger and put pressure on countries like many Middle Eastern countries and North Korea. Democracy should not be taken for granted anywhere. Also in countries now called democratic I believe there is a need to further enhance democracy.and social reform.

As a reader who really enjoyed Gladwell's previous book 'The Tipping Point' I had looked forward to his new book. In some respects the book is like I hoped it would be: the topic choice is very interesting, the writing style is smooth and entertaining, the many anecdotes are very enjoyable and there are some interesting descriptions of experiments. Anyone should be able to pick up some interesting stories, points, facts and views from this book.<br /><br />What disappoints me though is that the book does not really deliver what it promises. In the introduction chapter the author promises to answer three questions: 1) Can Blink-descisions be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately? 2) When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? 3) (how) can our snap judgments and first impressions be educated and controlled? Although the many stories in the book certainly imply clues to answers to these questions, explicit answers to these three questions are not clearly given. In fact, when I finished reading I felt like the author had forgotten to include a concluding and integrating chapter in which he would explicitly answer these questions and summarize and conclude. But that chapter is really missing. Due to that the book really lacks clarity.<br /><br />Although this book is disappointing I won't stop following Gladwell's writings. His previous book was better than this one and I'll bet his next one will be better too.	2005-02-14

But do we know what it is? Jeff Hawkins is one of the first people to present a specific and comprehesensive theory of intelligence with a leading role for the human neocortex. Hawkins starts by stating that Human intelliigence is fundamentally different from what a computer does.<br /><br />But isn't artifical intelligence (AI) a good metaphor for human intelligence? No, says Hawkins. In AI a computer is taught to solve problems beloning to a specific domain based on a large set of data and rules. In comparison to human intelligence AI systems are very limited. They are only good for the one thing they were designed for. Teaching an AI based system to perform a task like catching a ball is hard because it would require vast amounts of data and complicated algorithms to capture the complex features of the environment. A human would have little difficulty in solving such everyday problems much easier and quicker.<br /><br />Ok, but aren't neural networks then a good approximation of human intelligence? Although they are indeed an improvement to AI and have made possible some very practical tools they are still very different to human intelligence. Not only are human brains structurally much more complicated, there are clear functional differences too. For instance, in a neural network information flows only one direction while in the human brain there is a constant flow of information in two directions.<br /><br />Well, isn't the brain then like a parallel computer in which billions of cells are concurrently computing? Is parallel computing what makes human so fast in solving complex problems like catching a ball? No, says the author. He explains that a human being can perform significant tasks within much less time than a second. Neurons are so slow that in that fraction of a second they can only traverse a chain of 100 neurons long. Computers can do nothing useful in so few steps. How can a human accomplish it?<br /><br />All right, human intelligence is different from what our computers do. What then is it? I'll try to summarize Hawkin's theory.<br /><br />The neocortex constantly receives sequences of patterns of information, which it stores by creating so-called invariant representations (memories independent of details). These representations allow you to handle variations in the world automatically. For instance, you can still recognize your friends face although she is wearing a new hairstyle.<br /><br />All memories are stored in the synaptic connections between neurons. Although there is a vast amount of information stored in the neocortex only a few things are atively remembered at one time. This is so because a system, called `autoassociative memory' takes care that only the particular part of the memory is activated which is relevant to the current situation (the patterns that are currently flowing in the brain). On the basis of these activated memory patterns predictions are made -without us being aware of it- about what will happen next. The incoming patterns are compared to and combined with the patterns provided by memory result in your perception of a situation. So, what you perceive is not only based on what your eyes, ears, etc tell you. In fact, theses senses give you fuzzy and partial information. Only when combined with the activated patterns from your memory, you get a consistent perception.<br /><br />The hierarchical structure of the neocortex plays an important role in perception and learning. Low regions in the structure of the neocortex make low-level predictions (about concreet information like color, time, tone, etc) about what they expect to encounter next, while higher-level regions make higher-level predictions (about more abstract things. Understanding something means that the neocortex' prediction fits with the new sensory input. Whenever neocortex patterns and sensory patterns conflict, there is confusion and your attention is drawn to this error. The error is then sent up to higher neocortex regions to check if the situation can be understood on a higher level. In other words: are there patterns to be found somewhere else in the neocortex, which do fit to the current sensory input?<br /><br />Learning roughly takes place as follows. During repetitive learning memories of the world first form in higher regions of the cortex but as your learn they are reformed in lower parts of the cortical hierarchy. So, well-learned patterns are represented low in the cortex while new information is sent to higher parts. Slowly but surely the neocortex builds in itself a representation of the world it encounters. Hawkins: \\"The real world's nested structure is mirrored by the nested structure of your cortex.\\"<br /><br />This model explains well the efficiency and great speed of the human brain while dealing with complex tasks of a familiar kind. The downside is that we are not seeing and hearing precisely what is happening. When someone is talking we by definition don't fully listen to what he says. Instead, we constantly predict what he will say next and as long as there seems to be a fit between prediction and incoming sensory information our attention remains rather low. Only when he will say something, which is actively conflicting with our prediction, we will pay attention.<br /><br />The author takes his model one step further by saying that even the motor system is prediction driven. In other words, the human neocortex directs behavior to satisfy its predictions. Hawkins says that doing something is literally the start of how we do it. Remembering, predicting, perceiving and doing are all very intertwined.<br /><br />I think this is a fascinating and stimulating book. Many questions about intelligence may remain unanswered but I believe this book to be a step forward in our quest to understand intelligence. The author predicts we can soon build intelligence in computersystems by using the principles of the neocortex. He is optimistic about what will happen once we succeed in this. He (reasonably convincing) argues these systems will be useful for humanity and not a threat.<br /><br />Coert Visser, [...]o this error.

Flow, and the Making of Meaning	Books	5	81	83	N	N	Good Work Makes You Happy	Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is the Hungarian-born writer of the bestseller Flow. This professor of Psychology and Education at the University of Chicago has been studying this concept of Flow for many years and has written several interesting books, among which Flow (1990) and Finding Flow (1997). Now he has written a new book: Good Business. It turns out to be just the book I hoped he would write: a book about Flow and work.<br /><br />=WORK CAN CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR WELL-BEING!=<br />Although many people view work primarily negatively, it can actually contribute importantly to your well-being, more so than gaining more and more possessions. And because work is so important, it is vital that managers and employees create conditions in which good work can happen. But what is good work? It is enjoying doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself. Csikszentmihalyi explains how this can be achieved through two processes: 1) experiencing flow and 2) growth toward complexity. What precisely do these two things mean?<br /><br />1. Experiencing Flow<br />In situations of flow, tasks demand the full involvement of the person. In these situations there is a perfect balance between the challenge of the task and the skills of the person. The so-called 'flow channel' represents optimal experience, where both challenges and skills lie above the average level. More challenge than skill leads to arousal, anxiety, or worry. More skill than challenge leads to control, relaxation, or boredom. Flow depends on eight conditions: 1) goals are clear, 2) feedback is immediate, 3) a balance between opportunity and capacity, 4) concentration deepens, 5) the present is what matters, 6) control is no problem, 7) the sense of time is altered, 8) the loss of ego.<br /><br />2. Growth Toward Complexity<br />People flourish when in their activities there is a trajectory of growth that results in the development of increasing emotional, cognitive and social complexity. With complexity two processes happen at once: a) DIFFERENTIATION: realizing that we are unique individuals, responsible for our own survival and well being, b) INTEGRATION: the realization that however unique we are, we are also part of a larger whole.<br /><br />Conclusion: Regularly experiencing flow plus growing toward complexity are the ingredients of good work. But what about the 'happy' part? How can it be that pleasurable activities, products and relaxation are less important for happiness than the hard work of flow and complexity?<br /><br />=PLEASURE VERSUS ENJOYMENT =<br />Csikszentmihalyi contrasts pleasure with enjoyment. He explains pleasure is nice but also conservative and leading to equilibrium while enjoyment is like happiness in action leading to greater skills. Enjoyment leads to a \\"triumph over the forces of entropy\\" and is like building psychological capital. Too bad that our materialistic and marketing-dominated culture emphasizes the importance of pleasure over enjoyment, since enjoyment is far more likely to lead to long term happiness!<br /><br />=WHAT CAN MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES DO? =<br />Managers and employees can do quite a lot to advance conditions of flow and complexity. The book does not provide a simple list but the reader will probably get many ideas.<br />As a manager I could take the eight conditions of flow and the two aspects of complexity and use them to rethink work and the way I interact with my employees. Doing that I would recognize I need to (among other things) create attractive working conditions (with clear goals, feedback, etc), provide a good degree of control to stimulate the development of employees and build an organization with a long term purpose people can relate to. Another I could do is start a one-on-one or group dialogue with employees about these flow and complexity principles in order to improve work.<br /><br />Employees also can do a lot. As an employee I could do certain things to improve my objective work conditions. I could ask for clearer goals, and more specific and timely feedback. I could negotiate with my manager to get more autonomy and more flexibility in time schedules. Further, I could change the way I look at and what I expect from work. If I indeed believe that the hard work of flow and complexity indeed improves the quality of my life ...... I could resist the temptation to cut corners (doing my work with as little effort as possible) and instead pay attention more closely to the complexity of my tasks. In terms of my career development I could think about what kind of products I really believe in and what kind of company I truly would like to be part of.<br /><br />=CONCLUSION =<br />The book contains a great framework, is well written and contains good examples. The one I liked best is the anecdote about the brother of the author, Moricz. It was not until his eighties that Moricz took up the hobby of the collection and study of crystals. Moricz describes a flow experience he had when looking at one of his crystals.<br />\\"I was looking at this thing just yesterday,\\" he said, smiling. \\"It was nine in the morning when I put it under the microscope. Outside it was sunny, just like today. I kept turning the rock around, looking at all the fissures, the intrusions, the dozen or more different crystal formations inside and around...then I looked up, and thought that a storm must be coming, because it had gotten so dark...the I realized that it was not overcast, but the sun had been setting - it was past seven in the evening.\\"<br /><br />I think this is a wonderful book. I would, however, have liked the book even more if it had been still a bit more practical. Still, I recommend this book highly for anyone searching for ways to improve work and careers.

Downsizing remains very populair. It's easy to understand why. Whenever a company gets into serious financial trouble you have to rapidly increase revenues or to bring down costs. An easy choice:  everyone knows that future costs are far more controllable and predictable that future revenues. So costs are cut. And what better cost to cut than labor costs? In many companies these costs represent a large proportion of the total fixed costs. So what to do according to this logic? Fire employees!<br />BUT DO DOWNSIZINGS HELP? OFTEN THEY DON'T<br />In many cases downsizing does not lead to fast and lasting improvement of the financial situation of companies, nor to improvment of their share price. Research has demonstrated that extremely successful companies often offer a high level of employment security (see Pfeffer, 1998; Collins, 2001). But to my knowledge this book by Wayne Cascio is one of the first to present systematic longitudinal research on the effects of downsizing. The most important conclusion: companies that downsize are not more profitable than companies that don't and often end up hurting themselves. This book gives several reasons for this:<br />1. DOWNSIZING WITHOUT IMPROVING. Many downsizing companies have no vision on structurally improving the organization. The only thing they do is make the organization smaller. Many problems that previously existed remain. Several new problems are added. How could profit improve?<br />2. UNFORSEEN COSTS OF DOWNSIZINGS CAN BE SKYHIGH. Cascio sums up a large number of direct and indirect costs of downsizings.<br />3. DOWNSIZING TOO OFTEN AND TOO SOON. Cascio's research shows that many managers see personnel as a cost that should be minimalized. They ask: what is the minimum number of people we need to run this company?  This mindset made these managers downsize often and easily. This hurts loyalty, commitment and and a negative morale that hurts productivity.<br />The opposite is also true: offering employment security lead to loyalty. This loyalty leads to so-called Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB's): doing more than is asked, behaving honestly, working together, helping eachother.<br />WHAT TO DO?<br />The following combination of practices proves to be far more fruitful:<br />1. PREVENTIVE PLANNING: do everything you can to identify early warning signals and respond quickly to prevent problems from growing.<br />2. FIRST, APPLY CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES TO DOWNSIZING: in times of trouble, do everything you can to avoid the need to downsize (alternative ways of bringing down costs and improving revenues).<br />3. IF NOTHING ELSE WORKS: DOWNSIZE: make it clear to everything that downsizing is a last resort.<br />4. IF YOU DO IT, DO IT GOOD<br />Cascio descirbes a number of companies that were confronted with very hard circumstances and that successfully applied alternative stragies to downsizing.<br />Charles Schwab & Company used downsizing as a last resort after first having done the following: 1) stopping projects en saving al kinds of costs, accompanied with intensive communication efforts, 2) managers decided to cut their own salaries significantly, 3) personnel was encouraged to take unpaid leave, 4) specific days were chosen to be voluntary days off for personnel that did not have client contacts on these days. Only after these steps did not lead to sufficient success, a limited downsizing was done. Cisco Systems does everything it can to create goodwill or even loyalty with fired people. Cisco lents some of them to non-profit organizations and pays part of their salaries. As soon as the market allows for it, they want to rehire them. Reflexite Corporation's intention to avoid downsizing is reflected in their so-called Business Downturn Grid, a plan in four stages that is used when the company faces hard times.  Its starting point is to provide full openness in every stage about problems and actions to be taken. Employees are laid off only in the fourth and laststage (which the comany until now did not have to do by the way). Some other companies that are mentioned are: Compaq Computer that invested heavily in communicating with and training personnel when aftern downsizing, Intel, Chevrontexaco, en 3M that invested much in retraining and redeploying personnel to avoid downsizing, Acxiom, Inc. where personnel was (successfully) asked to volunteer to cut their salaries in return for company shares, Sage Software, Inc. that paid much attention to personnel planning, Louisiana-pacific Corporation where personnel took the initiative to cut cost drastically. Two other extremely successful companies that are extensively described by Cascio are software company The Sas Institute and Southwest Airlines. These companies operate in turbulent markets but are examples of (employment) stability and financial success.<br />CONCLUSION<br />Sometimes laying off personnel can't be avoided. But this book shows that companies that invest in personnel and that do everything to void downsizing profit form a no-layoff payoff. This book provides many examples of steps that can be taken before laying off personnel. It is a must for top managers, HR managers, and students of management and organization and of human resources management. It's easy to read and very practical.<br />Coert Visser, ...st stage (which the comany until now did not have to do by the way).

Today there are lots of trainers, coaches, consultants, and authors advocating the powers of intuition. 'Don't be too rational, trust you intuition!', they say. But how well-informed are these people about what intuition really is? To what extent can you rely on your intuition and to what extent should you be skeptical? In this book, David Myers, a well-known writer on psychology, explains what is known about intuition.<br />WE KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW WE KNOW<br />What is it anyway? David Myers explains that intuition is our capacity for direct knowledge, for immediate insight without observation or reason. In contrast, deliberte thinking is reasoning-like, critical, and anlytic. So there are two levels of thinking:<br />1. DELIBERATE THINKING: this level of thinking is conscious and analytical. It is very valuable because it helps us to focus on what is really important and protects us from having to think about everything at once. It is as it where the mind's executive desk.<br />2. INTUITION: this unconscious level is automatic. It seems, inside our minds there are processing systems that work without us knowing it. To use a metafor by David Myers: we effortlessly delegate most of our thinking and decisions making to the masses of cognitive workers busily at work in our minds's basement. These processes enables us, for instance, to recognize instantly, among thousands of humans, someone we have not seen in five years. We do know, but we don't know how we know.<br />WHAT WE KNOW, BUT DON'T KNOW WE KNOW, AFFECTS MORE THAN WE KNOW<br />Both ways of knowing are present within each person. Often they support eachother, sometimes they lead to conflicting conclusions. One thing is important: we tend to underrate how much of our actions are guided by unconsicous thinking. A vast proportion of our behavior is under control of unconscious perception and information processing. This 'automaticity of being' helps us through most of the situations we encounter (you type without consciously knowing where exactly the letters on your keyboard are; you'd have to 'ask your fingers` to know where they are). What's more, it is even so that we can process and be influenced by unattended information (for instance you had not noticed someone talking at a party until s/he mentioned your name, then you suddenly noticed this). Furthermore, we sometimes unconsciously continue processing information regarding problems (after having stopped trying to remember a name, we sometimes 'suddenly` remember it).<br />WE DON'T SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE, WE SEE THINGS AS WE ARE<br />Intuition is powerful and important and often it will pay to 'listen to your heart`. But intuition also often errs. An important example is that our theories and assumptions distort our perceptions and interpretations. For instance if we hold a stereotype about a certain category of people, we unknowingly tend to selectively perceive what they do. We tend to notice information that confirms the stereotype more readily than other information. This way, we tend to see our beliefs confirmed. Other examples of unrealistic intuition are: 1) hindsight bias ('I knew it all along'), 2) self-serving bias (accepting more responsibility for succeses that for failures), 3) overconfidence bias (we tend to intuitively assume that the way we perceive the world, so it is).<br />CONCLUSION<br />This is a great book for anyone interested in psychology and intuition. The material is presented very pleasantly and clearly. David Myers describes many interesting experiments that certainly will challenge your intuition (for instance some eye-opening experiments by the recent Nobel price winner psychologist Daniel Kahneman). Often these experiments will surprise you. Special attention is payed to the role of intuition in specific contexts like sports, investment, therapy, interviewing and risk taking. Psychology is still an interesting subject. This book is a clear reminder of that. ...	2002-10-30

Does altruism exist? Does true co-operative spirit exist? Or are all of these mere examples of subtle selfishness? In other words: are moral, altruistic and co-operative looking people just acting these behaviors to manipulate others? Are they in fact being opportunistic and selfish? Many economists claim altruism does not exist. They would say that, even when a person would do a nice thing to another, it would be, in the end, for his own benefit, and thus be an act of subtle selfishness. He would do it to gain the trust of the other person, to make a good impression and build a reputation of friendliness and trustworthiness or perhaps to create a dependency. Most of economic theory is still based upon the idea that people are in the end selfish and opportunistic. These economist call this 'rational'.<br /><br />Matt Ridley does not deny that individuals can act out of selfishness bu he argues that harmony generally prevails over selfishness. This book explains the paradox that our minds have been build by selfish genes to be social, trustworthy and co-operative. He says we owe our success as a species to these social instincts. He explains that morality is the stuff society is made of. In short his argument goes like this:<br /><br />1. Society is important because is allows for divison of labor. It allows for people to specialize. And the sums of all our specialized efforts are greater than they would be if we all had been generalists. In other words: society is synergy between specialists.<br /><br />2. In order to have a harmonious society, we have to be well-connected to each other. This requires us to be co-operative, social and trustworthy.<br /><br />3. Being social, co-operative and trustworthy is a way to thrive and thereby an evolutionairy advantage. These traits are built into our nature by evolution.<br /><br />Matt Ridley carefully argues his case. He uses findings from many disciplines like biology, psychology and economics. Very important parts of this book, and a delight to read, are the chapters where he explains the great work of Robert Axelrod (see: The Evolution of Co-operation, 1984) and the inspiring theory of moral sentiments of economist (!) Robert Frank (see: Passions within Reason, 1988).<br /><br />The message of this book is important. One lesson is that it is wise to teach our children to be good, because in the long run it pays. If you only act rationally (in the sense of the rational man from economic theory) you can only expect to reap short-term benefits. Another wise suggestion is that we need to build our institutions in such a way that they draw out our co-operative instincts (instead of building mechanisms aimed only at suppressing our supposed selfish nature). Ridley: \\"Pre-eminently this means the encouragement of exchange between equals. just as trade between countries is the best recipe for friendship between them, so exchange between enfranchised and empowered individuals is the best recipe for co-operation. We must encourage social and material exchange between equals, for that is the raw material of trust, and trust is the foundation of virtue.\\"<br /><br />Inspiring material...nd a delight to read, are the chapters where he explains the great work of Robert Axelrod (see: The Evolution of Co-operation, 1984) and the inspiring theory of moral sentiments of economist (!)

I had heard from a collegue (who is also a management coach) about solution focused working and, although I thought it sounded promising, I remained a bit skeptical. However, from the very moment I started reading 'Interviewing for solutions' my attention was firmly captured. Two chapters later I was practically sold. The approach is very clearly explained and the many dialogues in the book are really excellent (especially those by Insoo Kim Berg). After reading this book I started reading and learning more and I began using solution focused working in my practise as a coach and consultant. With peasure and success.	2002-04-25

Ellis originated REBT in 1955. Since then, it has gained great influence, primarily in therapy, but also in management coaching and training.<br />The basics of REBT have remained the same. They revolve around the ABCs of self-disturbing. (A) stands for the Adversities we encounter, (B) for our Beliefs about these Adversities, and (C) for the emotional and behavioral Consequences of these Beliefs. A coach, therapist, or trainer using REBT, has two goals: 1) to help people feel better and 2) to make them function better and does so by helping to replace the problematic Beliefs by more usable and realistic Beliefs.<br />Although the core of REBT has remained the same, some aspects of the approach have kept on evolving, and Ellis keeps on leading the development of REBT himself. The book shows many examples. Important is for instance that Ellis now defines the (B) of the ABCs not merely as Believing but as Believing-Emoting-Behaving.<br />Very interesting is how Ellis uses action language when writing about emotional problems. He thinks we misuse many nouns in psychology instead of verbs and therby create &quot;semifictional entities&quot; or &quot;thought things&quot;. An example: Ellis doesn't say: &quot;I suffer from depression&quot; but &quot;I depress (myself)&quot;.<br />A terrific chapter I found the one about postmodernism and constructivism in psychotherapy. I have never read such a clarifying chapter about this intruiging subject before. Ellis convincingly demonstrates how REBT and constructivism are not at odds but conincide well with each other. To illustrate, he says: &quot;You have considerable power to construct self-helping thoughts, feelings, and actions as well as to construct self defeating behaviors.&quot;<br />Although this book is NOT intended to be a self-help book, each chapter ends with some great self-help suggestions, which can also be read as chapter summaries. This book, which is filled with great insights, shows the great inspiraton of Ellis, which is still there.ook, each chapter ends with some great self-help suggestions, which can also be read as chapter summaries.

When I read this book, I was amazed. Based on what I had heard I had thoroughly convinced myself that our environment is getting worse and worse. And then there is this Danish associate professor Bjorn Lomborg, who writes a book describing, among other things, how:<br />1. The world population is not growing at a record rate; the growth rate has been steadily declining since 1964. The world's population is expected to stabilize just short of 11 billion.<br />2. There is more and more food per head of the world's population. This is largely caused by the success of the so-called 'Green Revolution' (high-yield crops, irrigation and controlled water supply, fertilisers and pesticides, and farmers' management skills). The number of people starving is decreasing (although the numbers are still frighteningly high!)<br />3. Our lives and health have improved dramatically over the past couple of hundred years due to better standards of living, better hygiene and water supplies and better medical therapy. And over the past 50 years poverty has fallen more than in the previous 500. Also in the developing world a fantastic progress has been made (although there is still a long way to go!). Furthermore, over the past three decades, inequality between countries has not been increasing but decreasing. This trend is expected to continue throughout much of the century.<br />4. We are not headed for a major energy crisis, nor are we likely to experience any significant scarcity of raw materials. The earth is not running out of energy or natural recourses.<br />5. We need to manage and price water more carefully but we are not facing insurmountable water shortages.<br />6. Overall, the pollution burden has diminished dramatically in the developed world. Air pollution has dramatically decreased over the past decades in the Western world while at the same time there has been a dramatic economic growth. It would be a mistake to believe that economic growth is in the process of destroying the earth. Economy and ecology complement each other.<br />7. Global warming is almost certainly taking place, but 1) probably less devastating than often claimed, 2) radical fuel cutbacks are worse than the original affliction<br />8. Biodiversity-reduction and deforestation do exist but to a much lesser extent than often thought and claimed.<br />Lomborg describes all of this very transparantly, uses clear statistics, uses excellent references and argues very logically, intelligently and subtly. He constantly keeps on explaining and reminding throughout the book that the fact that things are getting better does not mean everything is OK. He clearly points at the necessity to keep on focusing on solving all of the real problems we still face. Also he acknowledges that the fact that things are getting better overall does not mean that there are no places or times were things get worse. The author says for instance: \\"A lot still needs to be done to improve conditions in Africa, not only in the context of AIDS prevention but also for food availability and economic production.<br />I think this is a brave and terrific book. I was surprised by how ferociously it was attached by some authoritative scientists, for instance in Scientific American. These scientists treat the book literally as if it were an attack on science. I read many of the criticisms and Lomborg's response to them. And according to me, Lomborg wins by knock out. The criticisms are full of irrelevant personal attacks, misquotations and unsubstantiated attacks. Lomborg's replies are factual and to the point. I am not an expert at all in this field and I can't know how right Lomborg is. But if he's right, it wouldn't be the first time that established scientists deny a truthful new message and try to isolate the messenger.ying the earth.

The stories are detailed descriptions of the company's backgrounds, strategies, systems and management practices. The stories are also larded with quotes from the company's CEO's, HR managers and employees. Following this approach the authors provide the readers the opportunity to form their own hypotheses about the companies' successes. But the authors also present their interpretations of the case studies.<br />What these studies show is how these high performing companies have achieved their success by aligning their values, strategies and people. This is something which is easy to understand but hard to do. It requires consistent articulation and implementation of the values and vision and a relentless attention to detail in ensuring that all policies and practices support the company's values. In order to be able to show this kind of consistency a real belief and commitment are needed and a willingness to persevere.<br />This book shows how high performing companies consciously turn a lot of the conventional management wisdom upside down. For instance:<br />1. Contrary to what many people now think, recruiting, selecting and retaining unique talent is NOT the prime source of competitive advantage. Although these activities are important, the examples of these extraordinary companies show that it is much more important to build a culture and work system that enables all people to use their talents and develop their talents. A byproduct of this will be that your company will also be better at attracting and retaining people.<br />2. Values first instead of strategies. The conventional view puts competitive strategy on top and derives from that what structure is needed, what competencies and behaviors are needed and so on. The companies described here work differently. Although they do have competitive strategies these are secondary to their set of guiding values and to the alignment of these values with their management practices. In other words: they have a values-based view of strategy.<br />3. Respectful and trusting way of dealing with people. Many companies monitor, check and try to control employee behavior. The hidden value companies work differently. In the spirit of Douglas McGregor's book The Human Side of Enterprise, they seem to understand that if you begin by designing systems to protect against the small unmotivated minority, you end up alienating the motivated majority. So they put their people first by treating them respectfully, involving them and trusting them.<br />Lessons like the ones presented in this book can be found in several other books by for instance Jeffrey Pfeffer himself, David Maister and Jim Collins. What makes this book different and interesting to me is the presentation in the form of detailed case descriptions.of guiding values and to the alignment of these values with their management practices.

In the first chapter Pfeffer shows that conventional wisdom about the sources of organization success are not correct. In particular he disproves the ideas:<br />- that it is essential to work in the right sector,<br />- that the size of the organization is crucial,<br />- that it is necessary to have an international precense,<br />- that downsizing is indispensible, and<br />- that it is necessary to have a technological lead.<br />Then the author clearly and impressively presents the enormous amount of evidence of the last decade showing the strong association between how organization treat people and how they score on financial and operational performance indicators. Pfeffer describes the following seven HR practices that demonstrable correlate with organization success. He names these practices High Performance Work Practices. They are:<br />1. Employment security<br />2. Selective hiring of new personnel<br />3. Self-managed teams and decentralization of decision making as the basic principles of organization design<br />4. Comparatively high compensation contingent on organizational performance<br />5. Extensive training<br />6. Reduces status distinctions and barriers, including dress, languag, office arrangements, and wage differences across levels<br />7. Extensive sharing of financial and performance information throughout the organization<br />This list contains some elements that may seem counterintuitive to some. For instance: how can it be that high wages contribute to financial performance? Don't they just keep the profits low? And how can you afford to be selective in this hard labour market? And how can companies afford to invest much in training of personnel? Aren't employees so mobile and disloyal that you run the risk of training them for your competitor? Speaking about this, how can you in this time of employability of employment security? And it is wise to have an open information policy? If you'd do that, wouldn't you weaken your position by feeding your competitor with valuable information?<br />If you read this book you will find crystal-clear answers to these questions. The conclusion is that the seven practices do indeed work.ouldn't you weaken your position by feeding your competitor with valuable information? <br />If you read this book you will find crystal-clear answers to these questions.

The world of work changes like never before. Anybody who works is confronted with new work circumstances, new tasks and new demands. Old rules no longer apply. Organizations desperately look for new formulas of success. The human resources function, too, has to reflect on its own role and future, amidst all of this turbulence. That is what is happening now. HR slowly but surely has begun to transform itself fundamentally in many companies. This book is about that revolution.<br />The professionalization of the personnel function (nowadays usually called HR) first expressed itself in the development and implementation of procedures and systems for recruitment and selection, appraisal and reward, job descriptions and job evaluation and career development. At the same time the HR-person became the one who guarded the compliance with employee rights legislation.<br />In the last decade, the HR-function has increasingly become a target of criticism. The criticism is that the HR-function is too bureaucratic, controlling, too operationally focused, reactive and powerless. The author of this book, Weiss, says that HR indeed has not kept up with developments elsewhere in organizations. He says that HR professionals have become numb by the monopoly position they long enjoyed.<br /><br />Weiss describes in High Impact HR not only how he views the role and positioning of HR in the future but also how HR can transform itself. An entire chapter even deals with the question how HR can systematically get rid of old activities by disposing of them, postponing them, or outsourcing them.<br />The role of HR can, according to the author, become a very important one, that of a strategic business partner responsible for the return on investment in personnel and organisation. As main contributions of HR the following remain:<br />1) Business transformation processes: the cultivation of a flexible culture, alignment of initiatives, the implementation of changes and transition and the return on investment in human capital.<br />2) Organization value added processes: HR technology processes, creation of a continuous learning environment, organization development and consultancy.<br /><br />3) Core people processes, for instance recruitment and selection, performance development, compensation, etc.<br />To a lesser extent than before, HR will play a purely operational, administrative and service delivery role. Administration and execution remain important but a considerable part of these activities will be automated or outsourced to external suppliers. HR then becomes more a distributor than a producer of services. Another part of the HR activities will disappear through new technology applications. HR-information systems for example, take over routine tasks by automating the processing transactions and administration. Further, personnel itself will more and more be able to retrieve information from and change information in databases.<br />I find this book interesting bu not great. Not all ideas in this book get clearly worked out, for instance how HR could play a role in facilitating adding value to external customers. Another point of criticism is that Weiss defines the role of HR very broad. He states for instance that HR can help the company in developing excellence in managing relationships with its suppliers. Must HR be involved in everything and have expertise on everything? Weiss marks out the role of HR too broadly and vaguely, I think. The book contains several other examples of this. I think has little chance of becoming a classic. It does address, however, a very interesting and (still) timely topic. It also offers some useful and relevant knowledge. And, there are not too many other books on this.

These people play an important role in improving and renewing therapy. In this book, the authors explain how therapy has for too long been been neglecting, ignoring, and depersonalizing clients, by its over-emphasis on methods and techniques, by following the medical model, by its emphasis on pathology, by hegemony of biological approaches, and so on.<br /><br />The authors first debunk the myths of:<br /><br />1) PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS:<br />a) it lacks reliability,<br />b) it lacks validity,<br />c) it puts the blame on the client, and<br />d) it is often motivated by self-interest, fueled by greed, and blows with the winds of fashion,<br /><br />2)DRUG TREATMENT OF MENTAL PROBLEMS:<br />a) they work no better than therapy in the short term<br />b) changes brought about by medication are less likely to persist over time<br />c) there often are severe adverse effects,<br />d) drug studies often look better than they are because they rate improvement by looking to clinicians' perceptions, not clients'<br />e) the relationship between drug companies and psychiatry is an unholy alliance, making most of the drug-effectiveness research very suspect<br /><br />3) THE MAGIC APPROACH:<br />a) there is no special magic silver bullet approach which is much better than another approach<br />b) the role of the competence and experience of the therapist is rather unimportant<br /><br />According to the authors, four decades of outcome research have shown that there are four main factors of change, being:<br /><br />1. Client factors (percentage contribution to positive outcome: 40%).<br />2. Relationship factors (percentage contribution: 30%).<br />3. Hope and expectancy (percentage contribution: 15%).<br />4. Model and technique (percentage contribution: 15%).<br /><br />Some conclusions:<br />1. Thoughts, ideas, actions, initiatives, traits of clients are the most important predictor of therapy success!<br />2. Next to what the client brings to therapy, the client's perception of the therapeutic relationship is responsible for most of the gains resulting from the therapy.<br />3. Models and techniques are much less important than generally thought.<br /><br />The authors advocate a new and refreshing approach characterised by:<br />1) Client-directedness. Clients' beliefs, values, theories and goals are repected, close attention is being paid to clients' initiatives, interventions and perceptions. Much attention is given to establishing the quality of the relationship, and to monitoring the clients' perception of the quality of the relationship.<br />2) Outcome informedness. Progress is measured from session to session using paper and pencil questionnaires. By the way: the client's experience of meaningful change in the first few visits is emerging as one of the best predictors of eventual treatment outcome.<br /><br />Two thoughts come up after having read this book. First, this book is refreshing indeed and a shock to the therapy system. Second, the ideas ventilated in this book might be relevant for work outside the therapy field as well.

This man, who once admitted that, as a school child, he scored low on intelligence tests, later became one of the leading intelligence researchers and theorists in the world (if not THE leading one). He reached this status by applying highly original and unconventional ideas and research approaches (for instance, each day, on his way to work, he once interviewed laymen about how they defined intelligence!). The unbelievably productive Sternberg is probably most famous for his so-called triarchic theory of intelligence, but he also wrote about creativity, widom, love an other subjects in a highly original way.<br />Defying the crowd, written together with Todd Lubart, is about creativity. The book compares achieving creative success to achieving financial success as an investor. I think, the central idea of the book is reflected in the following quote: \\"In the realm of ideas, a person who buys low, metaphorically, is willing to generate and promote ideas that are novel and even strange and out of fashion. This is not necessarily easy to do. Other people react to the creative person the way they react to the investor who swims against the tide: 'What's the matter with you?'Others often see him or her as irrational or even stupid: if the investment or idea were any good, other people would already be using it, right?\\"<br />One of the reasons I like this book so much, is because Robert Sternberg is perhaps the most credible person to have (co-)written it, being a living example of achieving incredible success by defying the crowd.	2001-11-20

It very practically shows how big changes in societies often happen unexpectedly and suddenly and can be caused by small events. The explanation is: if circumstances are right, ideas, behavior and products can, with the help of the right kinds of people, spread throughout a society like an epidemic. When that happens, a critical point, the tipping point, can be reached at which the behavior and features of the system itself suddenly change. This principle is clearly illustrated by stories about the sudden decrease in crime in New York in the nineties, by the sudden popularity of Hush Puppies and by several other interesting stories. This book contains many interesting ideas and facts, some of them very counter-intuitive. The author manages to make accessible some implications of chaos theory in a very easy and entertaining way for a large public. What I also like about this book is the optimistic tone and message: change is possible and it can happen non-linearly, which means that small events can lead to major changes. Fascinating book.	2001-11-20

This can happen when disruptive technologies enter the stage. Most technologies improve the performance of existing products in relation to the criteria which existing customers have always used. These technologies are called sustaining technologies. Disruptive technologies do something different. They create an entirely new value proposition. They improve the performance of the product in relation to new performance criteria. Products which are based on disruptive technologies are often smaller, cheaper, simpler, and easier to use. However, the moment they are introduced, they can not at once compete against the traditional products and so they cannot directly reach a big market. Christensen researched how disruptive technologies have developed in the computer disk industry, an extremely rapid evolving industry. He identified six steps in the emergence of disruptive technologies:<br />1. Disruptive technologies often are invented in traditional large companies. Example: at Seagate Technology, the biggest producer of 5,25 disks, engineers in 1985 designed the first 3,5 disk.<br />2. The marketing department examines first reactions from important customers to the new technology. Then they notice that existing customers are not very interested and they conclude that not a lot of money can be made with the new product. Example: this is what happened at Seagate. The 3,5 disk's were put upon the shelf.<br />3. The company keeps on investing in the traditional technology. Performance improvement of the traditional technology is highly appreciated by existing customers and a lot of money is being made. Example: Seagate invested in the 5,25 disk technology. This led to considerable improvement of the technology and to a considerable improvement of sales.<br />4. New companies are started up (by ex-employees of the traditional companies) and markets for the new technology emerge by trial and error. Example: ex-Seagate people started up Corner Peripherals. This company focused on the small emerging market for 3,5 inch disks. In the beginning this was only for the laptop market.<br />5. The new players move up in the market. The performance of the new technologies gets better after some time, enabling them to compete better and better with the traditional companies and products. Example: the performance of the 3,5 disks improved drastically. The 3,5 inch disk moved up in the market, to the personal computer market. Corner pushed Seagate out of the PC market for 3,5 inch disk drives.<br />6. Traditional companies try to defend their market position and to get along in the new market. Often they notice that they have fallen behind so far, that they cannot keep up. Example: Seagate did not succeed in capturing a significant part of the new market for 3,5 inch disk drives for PC's.<br />The events described above can be understood by the four principles of disruptive technologies which Christensen formulates:<br />1. In well-led companies it is customers, not managers, who actually determine resources allocation. This is a proposition of the resources dependence theory (Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978) which is supported strongly by the research of Christensen. In essence: middle managers will not tend to invest in technologies that are not directly appreciated by important (large) clients, because they will not be able to get quick financial gains by doing this.<br />2. Small markets can not fulfil the growth need of large companies. For several reasons, growth is important for companies. Unfortunately, the bigger the company, the harder it is to continue growth. A small company (40 million sales) with a growth target of 20%, must achieve 8 million extra sales. A large company (4 billion sales), has to achieve 800 millionof extra sales! Emerging markets often simply are not large enough to fulfil such growth needs. They can, however, fulfil the growth needs of new small companies.<br />3. Markets that do not exist can not be analysed. The ultimate applications of disruptive technologies can not be foreseen on forehand. Failure is an intrinsic unavoidable step to success.<br />4. Technology supply does not always equal the market demand. The speed of technological progress is often bigger than the speed with which the customer demand develops. By improving the performance of the disruptive technologies (for instance the 3,5 inch disks, first only used in the laptop market), they became suitable for the larger PC-market.<br />These steps explain why traditional companies are often not capable of applying disruptive technologies. Christensen argues that you can not resist these four principles. What you can do however, is use them to your advantage. For instance: in a large company you can create an 'island' where the new technology is developed for the new market. Also it is possible get an ownership in emerging companies which develop the new technologies (several companies have done this successfully).<br />I think the innovator's Dilemma is an excellent book. The ideas are empirically foudend and together they form a coherent theoretical framework. The examples from the computer disk industry, the steel industry and others, are very well-documented and interesting. The book is logically structured and reads easily.0 million of extra sales!

Well,  isn't a good life just about being happy? Ok, but that is not the complete answer. For how do we become and stay happy? Not by watching TV, eating, or relaxing all day! In small doses these things are good and improve your daily life, but the effects are not additive. In other words: a point of diminishing returns is quickly reached. Also you don't become happy by having to do nothing. Csikszentmihalyi's research shows that both intrinsic motivation (wanting to do something) and extrinsic motivation (having to do something) are preferable to not having any kind of goal to focus your attention.<br />Csikszentmihalyi argues that a life filled with `flow activities' is more worth living than one spent consuming passive entertainment. He says, the point is to be happy while doing things that stretch your goals and skills that help you grow and fulfil your potential. In other words: the content of your experiences over a lifetime determines the quality of your life. Then what exactly &igrave;s `flow'? Is it just some vague new New Age concept? Not at all! It is precisely defined and well-researched. The experience if flow is the sense of effortless action we feel in moments that we see as the best in our lives. In order to have flow experiences you need clear goals/demands, immediate and relevant feedback and a balance between your skills and the demands. Then your attention becomes ordered and fully invested. Because of the total demand on you psychic energy you become completely focused, your self-consciousness disappears, as does your sense of time, yet you feel strong and competent. When in flow, you are not exactly happy, because you are not focused on your inner states (that would take away your attention from the task at hand). But looking back you are happy. Having flow experiences leads to growth and learning and improving your life becomes a question of making flow as much as possible a constant part of your everyday experience.<br />Csikszentmihalyi describes how you can find flow in several important life domains. One domain is work. Often we short-sightedly spend a lot of energy to take the easy way and cut corners, trying to do as little as possible in our jobs. If we would spend the same amount of energy trying to accomplish more we would probably enjoy our work more and be more successful as well. To improve your work you can try to take the whole context of your job into account. Doing this you can better understand your contribution to the whole and understand and value your role more. This enables you to invest more energy and withdraw more meaning from your work. Further, to use flow at work you can try to establish a situation in which your job (an other people's jobs) provides clear goals, unambiguous feedback, a sense of control, few distractions and challenges that match your skills. Just as much as in work you can create flow in your family and other relationships according to Csikszentmihalyi. He says it is particularly important to give attention to building harmony between participant's goals and to find ways to balance the meaningfulness of the rewards you get from work and relationships.<br />This book is definitely worth reading.

McGregor describes Theory X and Theory Y, two fundamentally different ways managers view their employees. McGregor describes Theory X as the dominant view: people ar seem as lazy, not very capable, unwilling to work (unless you make them work), opportunistic and prepared to deceive (providing they think they won't be caught). Theory Y views people in a much more positive way: they are seen as intrinsically motivated, willing to work and basically honest. Now the essential point: the way you view people determines the way you treat them and the way you interpret their behavior, which determines the way they will respond to you, which in turn will reinforce the way you view(ed) them. In other words: both Theory X and Theory Y are true because they create their own reality! They are self-fulfilling prophecies. If you have a choice, what do you choose? This book, written many years ago, is still an interesting read and I think you can still read it in 2060 and find it relevant and interesting.	2001-10-18

But what is meant by optimistic thinking in this book? Well, to make sense of what happens in their life, people tend to attach explanations to events after they have happened. This process is usually referred to as `attribution'. Seligman describes how people differ in their explanatory style, in other words, they have different `habits of explanation'. He distinguishes three dimensions of attribution: 1) permanence (is the cause of the event permanent or temporary?), 2) pervasiveness (is the cause of the event general or specific?), and 3) personalization (is the cause of the even internal -personal- or external - caused by the sitution?). The difference between optimists and pessimist can be described using these three dimensions.<br />Pessimists tend to believe that negative things that happen to them 1) will have a long-lasting effect, 2) will affect many situations, and 3) are caused by themselves. Also, when something positive happens the pessimist tends to explains this negatively by 1) thinking this is just temporary success, 2) won't help him in other situations than this specific one, 3) and is caused by the situation more than by his own competence.<br />Optimists explain situations exactly the other way around. They tend to think that negative events 1) are just a temporary setback, 2) only affect th&igrave;s situation, and 3) are externally caused (not their own fault). Positive things are also explained positively by the optimistic thinker. He will think 1) that the success will last long, 2) that the success will positively affect other situations as well, and 3) that the success was caused by his own doing.<br />What's the relevance of this? Pessimists, by their way of thinking, constantly tend to destroy their own hope and build self-blame en guilt. A pessimistic thinking style causes many problems: emotional problems, under-utilization of your potential, and health-problems. Thinking pessimistically is a dangerous habit. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy: by thinking you have no way of influencing a bad situation, this becomes true. Optimists, on the other hand, build hope and maintain a positive self-image. They perform better at school and/or work, and are, on average, healthier. If this sounds interesting to you, maybe you should read this book. It will help you to assess your own habits of explanation and helps you to develop the skill of thinking positively.potential, and health-problems. Thinking pessimistically is a dangerous habit.

You might think: \\"Ah, here we go again.... Is this just the next new management hype, destined to be forgotten soon?\\" I don't think so. I think complexity theory is to be taken a bit more serious than that. What is it? It is a rapidly developing theoretical framework that describes and explains fundamental processes of complex adaptive systems, like organizations. What is a complex adaptive system? The authors of this book, Edwin Olson and Glenda Eoyang, explain that in a complex adaptive system, a multitude of different players (called agents) held together by some cohesive force (called a container) and constantly interacting with each other in all kinds of ways (these interactions are called transforming exchanges).<br /><br />The self-organizing nature of human interactions in a complex organization leads to surprising effects. Small actions, events and interactions can lead to dramatic outcomes affecting the whole system. Human interactions in complex systems lead to so-called emergent properties, which are features of the system that the separate parts do not have. (For example, brain cells don't have consciousness, but the human brain does). All of this explains why it is often impossible to understand let alone predict or control events and developments. This is a rather big departure from the traditional view, which tends to see organizations as understandable, predictable and ... controllable!<br /><br />Then how exactly is the complexity theory approach to change management different from the traditional approach? Ed Olson and Glenda Eoyang summarize the main features of the CAS approach to change as follows: 1) Achieve change through connections between agents (instead of trying to control the change top-down), 2) Adapt to uncertainty (instead of trying to use predictable stages of development), 3) Allow goals, plans, and structures to emerge (instead of depending on clear and detailed plans or goals), 4) Amplify and value difference (instead of always directly focusing on consensus), 5) Create self-similarity (instead of difference between levels), 6) Regard success as a matter of fit with the environment (instead of focusing on one dimensional success measures).<br /><br />It's hard to accurately summarize in a few words what's in this book. So, if you're organizational development consultant, perhaps you'd better read it yourself. What you will find is that the book is a nice mix of theory, case descriptions and practical tools which (some of which are very nice and handy).

Reading things like 'How to profit from your contradictions' and 'bringing together the paradoxical sides of yourself to achieve outstanding results', I feared it might turn out to be kind of vague and superficial. But I decided to give the book the benefit of the doubt, because I quite liked Jerry Fletcher's previous book \\"Patterns of High Performance\\".<br />How wrong can you be in your expectations...The book turned out to be a downright fascinating read! The book describes with great clarity a very specific step-by-step method by which you can identify seemingly contradictory characteristics of yourself (the authors call this your 'core paradox'). Both of these contradictory characteristics can be expressed either in a negative way or in a positive way.<br />When these contradictory characteristics are expressed in their most negative way, a nightmare-scenario can follow. When this happens, a person swings back and forth between the two (negative) sides of the paradox, leaving him or her hopeless, without energy and ineffective. However, when these contradictory characteristics are expressed in their most positive way, both (positive) sides of the paradox are simultaneously present.<br />Because of this, you can produce creative resolutions of dilemma's that previously seemed intractable. Using a tool called 'Fletcher's pendulum', you can figure out how to get from the negative expression of your core paradox to a positive expression. How this exactly works, you should of course read in the book. It has many examples and is packed with practical wisdom. I found it extremely valuable.	2001-09-08

Often, we assume that working toward a goal and setting standards for ourselves can only take place if we compete against others. By perceiving tasks or play as a contest we often define the situation to be one of MEGA: mutually exclusive goal attainment.<br />This means: my success depends on your failure. Is this wise? No! Is this inevitable? No! This book brilliantly shows how: 1) competitiveness is NOT an inevitable feature of human nature (in fact, human nature is overwhelmingly characterised by its opposite - co-operation), 2) superior performance not only does not require competition; it usually seems to require its absence (because competition often distracts people from the task at hand, the collective does usually not benefit from our individual struggles against each other), 3) competition in sports might be less healthy than we usually think because it contributes to the competitive mindset (while research shows that non-competitive games can be at least as enjoyable and challenging as competitive ones), 4) competition does not build good character; it undermines self esteem (most competitors lose most of the time because by definition not everyone can win), 5) competition damages relationships, 6) a competitive mindset makes transforming of organizations and society harder (those things requiring a collective effort and a long-term commitment).<br />I think many people reading this book will recognize in themselves their tendency to think competitively and will feel challenged and inspired to change. And that's a good thing. Our fates are linked. People need to, and can choose to, build a culture in which pro-social behaviors and a co-operative mindset are stimulated. The competitive mindset can be unlearned. By developing a habit to see and define tasks as co-operative we can defy the usual egoism/altruism dichotomy: by helping the other person you are helping yourself.asks as co-operative we can defy the usual egoism/altruism dichotomy: by helping the other person you are helping yourself.	2001-09-03

How and to what extent can intelligence be developed? What aspects of intelligence can de identified and what aspects especially demand attention? While the classic view of intelligence implies that intelligence is a fixed, genetically determined characteristic of individuals this book presents a different perspective: a theory of learnable intelligence clarifying to what extent and how our intelligence can be amplified. Three dimensions of intelligence are identified: 1) neural intelligence: neurological speed and precision; in large part genetically determined, 2) experiential intelligence: extensive common knowledge and skill and specialized knowledge and skill; learned, 3) reflective intelligence: strategies for memory, problem solving, mental self-monitoring, meta-cognition; learned. Perkins argues that reflective intelligence offers the best opportunity for improving intelligent thought and behavior. Perkins identifies important pitfalls in human thinking and reasoning and shows how to avoid them. The author acknowledges that intellectual talent is a real phenomenon and does not deny any intellectual differences in intellectual talent. He argues that most people can learn to use whatever intellectual talents they have much better than they normally do. This book, which reminds of the work of Robert Sternberg, is a true must for anyone interested in theories of intelligence.	2001-09-03

And several books before this one have preached courageous and long term oriented leadership. This book confirms these messages but does more: it presents convincing evidence to support these well known conclusions. Maister has done a very elegant yet sophisticated study which he very lucidly and accessibly explains throughout the book and which very clearly proves his point. But don't worry: the book isn't dull and boring. Maister illustrates his research conclusions with fascinating case stories. Of course the message of this book is very positive and hopeful. Like Maister says: \\"Making money by having high standards [respect, trustworthyness, courage, etc] and never compromising them. What a concept!\\" But, you might think, is this not all idealistic soft talk? Is this not too good to be true? Is it that easy? Not really! Practising what you preach requires courage and determination. What I found particularly interesting is the following: this book is more than anything about the difference in what you believe in and what you actually execute. And this is where courage comes in. For example the courage to say 'This far and no further!' when people show disrespect to others, or when other essential standards are violated. It also means saying 'no' to lucrative business which does not fit with your companies' vision/mission. And there is more, but you can read that in the book.<br />This book can inspire you to escape from the idea that you have to find the right balance between idealism and profitability; it invites you to be both highly idealistic and higly profitable. It can be done. Maister proves it.	2001-08-29

And, because for most people incomes have remained static or have even declined (in the US and the UK), this extra spending was financed by lower savings and higher debts, making the economy weaker and more vulnerable. Further, most people work longer and tend to spend less time on important activities such as vacations, being with family, sleeping exercising, etc. To make things worse: Americans spend less on vital public services which leads to a deteriorating infrastructure, to higher crime, to dirty streets and parks, to water pollution, to a deteriorating education system, etc. And what about health? 40 million Americans currently lack health insurance.... This book explains how there is a competition 1) between different forms of private spending (do we buy luxury or do we spend our money differently?) and 2) between private and public spending. To expand on the latter point: a growing share of the US national income is spent on consumption and spending on vital publics services is increasingly threatened. Frank explains (on the basis of well-being research and the adaptation-level theory) that the main reason we buy luxury goods is to demonstrate to others that we can afford to thereby trying to distinguish ourselves from them. In doing so we try to achieve happiness by improving our relative status. The irony is, however, this absolutely doesn't work! The satisfaction we get from luxury spending, which Frank calls conspicuous spending, depends largely on context. The satisfaction we get from luxury spending lasts only shortly. Two examples: 1) If we buy an expensive car, this distinguishes us from our neighbour and we feel happy. If, however, next month our neighbour buys an even fancier one, our satisfaction will be largely gone. You can see how this leads to an escalation, an arms race, with no winners. 2) The satisfaction we get from luxury goods tends to decline steeply over time. We tend to get used quickly to what we have and the favourable features of the luxury good tend to fade into the background rapidly: we no longer notice the fancy features of our expensive car and our satisfaction diminishes. Bottom line: this increasing conspicuous spending does more harm than good. We have to discourage conspicuous consumption in favour of inconspicuous consumption. Frank explains that no individual or family alone can solve this problem. It has to be solved at a higher level. He proposes a simple but effective measure to discourage conspicuous consumption, a progressive consumption tax levied on consumption rather than income. Frank claims this tax can stimulate radical changes in the ways we lead our lives. Contrary to the believe of many, he convincingly argues, this progressive consumption tax would not cripple the economy but invigorate it.

This other view leads to more pleasure, better performance and more effective learning in work. The ideas in this book are so powerful and relevant and Gallwey describes them so clearly that it seems virtually impossible n&oacute;t to apply them. Gallwey's core message is: the traditional way in which we try to improve ourselves and our performance -through (self-)instruction and supervision- blocks what we try to achieve. To be more specific: an instructive, controlling approach to performance improvement does not lead to better but to worse performance!<br />After Gallwey finished his English study at Harvard University in the nineteen seventies, he went to work as a tennis coach. Doing that, he discovered that nearly all his pupils tried very hard to improve one aspect of there play that they did not like, for instance their backhand. They expected Gallwey to give them the remedy for their problem. First, this was exactly what he did: &quot;hold your racket like this, stand there, hit the ball then&quot;, etc. He instructed pupils but noticed that they showed resistance to his instructions and that their learning did not go well. Then he noticed, to his surprise, that the performance suddenly was better when pupils stopped trying so hard to correct their mistakes but instead just played tennis for fun. Based on this observation that the 'forced mode' of learning was less effective than the `natural' mode Gallwey built his approach. His book `The Inner Game of Tennis' became a bestseller.<br />Gallwey proposed that the ineffective, instructive dialogue between coach and pupil also existed within the head of the pupil. While playing, the pupil continuously gave himself instructions and comments: \\"that was really bad, hold your racket like this, do this, don't do that\\" etc. Gallwey called the coach inside the pupils head SELF-1. In Gallwey's words: SELF-1 is the collection of internalised voices from the outside world. To whom then did this internal coach speak? According to Gallwey it spoke to the person him or herself. He called this spoken-to self the SELF-2. The best learning took place when SELF-1 was turned off. How is this possible? Gallwey's answer: While SELF-1 is busy giving vague and (too) simple instructions, SELF-2 is doing something infinitely more complex and precise: computing the curve of the ball, instructing muscle groups, taking into account the wind speed, the speed of the ball, etc.<br />Gallwey concluded that SELF-1 was a from of interference that led to nothing else than an underutilization of the person's potential. In other words: Performance = Potential - Interference. In still other words: don't let SELF-1 distract you from your task and goal!<br />Gallwey formulated a different, more effective and more elegant way of coaching aimed at achieving three things: 1) Awareness: by letting SELF-2 do its work the pupil can focus on collecting information on the critical variables in the task (where is the ball landing? How fast is it going? How is it influenced by the wind? etc) which leads to a greater awareness of the task; 2) Choice: it is essential that the pupil determines what he or she wants to achieve. Without this choice there is no direction and focused attention is impossible; 3) Trust: trust yourself. This goes for both the coach and the pupil. This refers to the confidence that SELF-2 will be capable of fulfilling the task.<br />Galwey gradually started to apply his approach to others field that tennis: golf, skiing, music and ...work. He noticed that the effects were the same. For instance: a salesman who stopped instructing and commenting himself became more effective. In seminars Gallwey draws a triangle with on the corners the words: performance, learning en enjoyment. Gallwey claims that each of these are of great importance in work and that they are dependent on each other. When you neglect enjoyment, this will eventually also lead to performance problems. What Gallwey says about the relationship between performance and learning is interesting. Performance leads to an observable change in the external world. Learning, however, establishes a change within the person who learns. It is precisely because of this that learning results are hard to measure. Enjoymentis important according to Gallwey because it refers to the relationship the person has to him or herself. If you appreciate yourself, you won't deny yourself enjoyment for a prolongued period.<br />Since his discovery Gallwey's most important ambition has been to let himself and others enjoy the freedom to express in their work who they really are and what they really want. He says that human freedom is nowhere more constrained than in the world of work. Nowadays, the most prevailing experience of work even seems to be: someting I'd rather not be doing if I had a choice. Gallwey says that striving for freedom at work is not the same as wanting to avoid responsibility or bosses. It is about choosing a way of working which shows responsibility to oneself. A way which is aligned with your choices and values. Gallwey uses the word 'conformity' to describe the situation when an individual gives priority to extranl demands above his internal fire. Doing this brings the security of doing and being like others but it puts out our internal fire and it diminishes our chance of satisfaction. If life decisions are based on external demands instead of internal demands, someting of the greatest value can be lost. The conflict between external and internal voices seems unfair. There is constant pressure from the outside world to conform. Sanctions, corrections, instructions, rewards, etc. are everywhere. The external world is so large and the internal so small. But the internal has one advantage: it is always there. An important step would be to understand why conformity is so attractive to us and how it affects our way of working. As an alternative to conformity Gallwey names its opposite 'mobility': the freedom to move in any direction without self-restriction.<br />The central idea in this book is that there is a better way of thinking about working and learning that comes down to giving more priority to our inner capacities and whishes and less to external expectations, norms and instructions. I think this is a valuable book. The author gives good and convincing examples of the inner game, for instance applied to the field of sales. In this time of extreme change good and new ideas about how people can learn and perform are wellcome. Gallwey delivers this.ntually also lead to performance problems.
