Review of The Heart of Whiteness<br /><br />For those who choose to take the trip, Professor Jensen has charted a course, in plain English, and with few pretensions, to fuller understanding of the depth of the scars that American racism has left on our humanity.  It has infected our individual and collective psyches with a disease that is difficult to overcome: the disease of color prejudice, white privilege, white supremacy, white superiority, and white racism.<br /><br />In the same vein as that of Lillian Smith's \\"Killing the Dream;\\" or Tim Wise's \\"White Like Me;\\" or indeed with the same skill and moving passion as the F. H. Griffith classic, \\"Black Like Me,\\" professor Jensen has used his own life experience, and his considerable intellectual skills to shake not just the white conscience, but the conscience of America.  And while he cannot be blamed for not solving all the problems he raised, we must all be grateful to him for having the courage to raise them, and for doing so in such a clear-minded, passionate and committed manner.<br /><br />In this short volume, the University of Texas at Austin Professor, Robert Jensen, has demonstrated that he has acquired the necessary self-knowledge (the escape velocity needed to propel himself beyond the orbit of \\"naïve white supremacy\\" into the orbit of \\"fully self-conscious white supremacy\\") to break away from the comforts of white privilege.  This is an important and necessary, but as he so eloquently noted, an insufficient step on the road to overcoming the disease of white privilege, and its larger manifestation, American style white racism.<br /><br />Jensen has let the cat out of the bag: White humanity is just short of a fraud built on the quicksand of propped up privileges, unfair advantages, unjust prerogatives, structural injustices, four-century-old myths, four centuries of violence and genocide, and lies, all insulated and protected by a system of soft tyranny and spatial Apartheid.  In short, if one understands Jensen correctly, America has sacrificed all of the little humanity it has, on the altar of skin color superiority.<br /><br />As Jensen has discovered, in this his much-needed second thrust -- re-entering the old orbit of white supremacy armed with self-knowledge -- is a much trickier step than being a content, \\"naïve white supremacist.\\"  For, as the author has discovered, the invisible power of systemic racial hegemony is the ultimate goal, and the real name of the game of white supremacy.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear a truism seldom recognized: that American racism is no longer personal.  It no longer matters how many committed anti-racists we can summon to a given cause; or who hates or does not hate blacks; or how many skinheads roam the streets, the anti-racists cannot acquire (nor will they ever constitute) a critical mass in American society.<br /><br />The consolidation and preservation of white privilege through systemic racist power is self-defining, self-promoting, and now all but a self-regulating and self-sustaining process.  There is no longer a need to consolidate white privilege, for there can be no better consolidation than having it built in to all the structures of American power.  Destroying white privilege, on the other hand, represents a \\"clear and present danger\\" to American Society as we know it.  Taking Jensen's arguments to their logical conclusions, white identity, the very basis of white self-esteem, and white humanity are all built on the sand castle of exaggerated heroics, violence and color myths -- enforced meanings that favor puffed up interpretations of white history, and the de-valuing and denigration of blacks and other non-white peoples contributions.<br /><br />As is implicit in this brief but deeply moving confessional, if one looks deeply enough, one will discover that systemic racism transcends and thus resists all attempts at re-adjustments designed to overcome its negative aspects.  It has evolved in such a manner that it now can be seen to operate on autopilot: The laws of American social physics and of American racist power mechanics are simple and virtually immutable.  They dictate that there can be no absolute black progress relative to whites; that is, that the racist system must remain in a virtual steady-state: Black progress must ALWAYS be compensated for with equal and offsetting amounts of white progress, otherwise whites become agitated and uncomfortable.<br /><br />It is consider bad sport to attempt to close the absolute distance between the races -- either socially, economically, or politically.  Power is the name of the game.  As Jensen makes clear, it hardly matters any more what individuals on either side of the racial divide do:  The script of the drama has been written, signed, and sealed through the interlocking mechanisms of racist power: lockstep, we all have learned to play out to the last letter, our respective ascribed roles.  No deviations are allowed.<br /><br />To step outside the racist norm as Dr. Jensen has done, is to be considered a \\"race traitor,\\" and to be brutally jerked back in line and reminded that America's benign and soft racist totalitarianism is neither benign, nor soft.  And, in the end, although everything is designed to look different on the surface, taking on different textures and colors, depending on the angle, the brutal fact remains that all power alignments are fixed, immutable and must stay exactly the same -- consolidated under the insulated and ever-protective umbrella of white supremacist hegemony.<br /><br />Put yet another way, in the end, and at a much deeper level, all moves on the American chessboard have been pre-determined to promote, enable, and consolidate the \\"ways of white power,\\" and the \\"ways of white supremacy.\\" Whether it be of the \\"naïve\\" or of the \\"profoundly self-conscious\\" white supremacist sort that Professor Jensen exhibits, is really of little or no consequence.<br /><br />As Jensen alludes to himself:by making a virtue out of emerging demographic and moral necessity, the white supremacists have used their favorite unconscious (conscious) tactic: that of redefining and renaming racial discrepancies - this time as multiculturalism  and racial and cultural diversity -- and realigning minority interests so that they look much like the chauvinistic white supremacist imperatives they are allowed to mimic.<br /><br />Once meaning has been drained, redefined, refilled and then realigned, white supremacy is then put firmly back on track; the challenge has been averted, successfully squashed: everything can then be returned to normal but with a different cosmetic look, made to look different (even positive) while at the same time remaining exactly the same.  This \\"co-optation through redefinition and re-incorporation\\" is the newest systemic way of deflecting all new challenges to racist hegemony.<br /><br />No matter what the moves are on the American chessboard, white supremacy remains the same old Black Hole that it always has been: a closed insular mean-spirited, evil, structurally violent system from which nothing enters or escapes that does not get altered to promote, consolidate, or enable \\"the ways of racism.\\"  In the end, we are all Condoleeza Rices and Clarence Thomas': closet white supremacists, pretending that we do not know how we are being used to advance the evils of a bankrupt system.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear that racism, as expressed through the insular world of white privilege, is the gravity that holds the whole stinking system of white supremacy together.  The idea that there may yet be an anti-racist world \\"out there\\" somewhere where whites will someday voluntarily give up their power and privileges is fanciful and a highly theoretical notion that may in the end be just another illusion, or mirage (like real multiculturalism is).<br /><br />No one has yet seen, inhabited, or can even describe the steps needed to get to such a world.  And while Professor Jensen has made a heroic effort to push us out of our comfort zones -- to the frontiers of a new kind of non-racist thinking and understanding -- in the end even he admits that this will not crack the nut at the center of this peculiar American disease.  Even self-conscious white supremacy is perhaps too little, too late.  He of course cannot be blamed for this.<br /><br />What then to do?<br /><br />Even though everyone seems to understand that systemic problems cannot be solved at non-systemic levels of analysis -- that is, beneath the system as a whole -- they nevertheless seem more comfortable attacking problems of racism at these lower inherently ineffectual levels (at the community and interpersonal levels, for instance) rather than at the national level.  I think this is a strategic as well as a systemic mistake.<br /><br />If we stopped only for a moment to think, we would realize that if any of the laws we have on the books regarding racism were ever to be enforced to the letter, without deviation, racism in America would soon wither away. And, there would be no need to have to re-enact the same ineffectual laws over and over again.  \\"Paper or legal equality\\" does not work because it is not worth the paper it is written on, and that includes the U.S. Constitution.  The failure to enforce a law, over time makes it a \\"dead letter,\\" an inert symbolic fraud, like the flawed white humanity that has been used to underwrite it.<br /><br />When will whites begin to understand, that it is not just a \\"lack of progress\\" to fail to enforce the Constitution, it is a sharp stab in the heart of American humanity; it renders the Constitution a \\"dead letter,\\" a paper fraud.<br /><br />Thus, the first step we need to take is to plug the holes between democratic theory and everyday American practice; between our stated ideals, which sit on pedestals to be lauded as they collect dust, and our everyday American practice.  If disincentives were built-in to discourage this kind of leakage, we could solve the problems of racism over night.  No need for Affirmative Action or grand theorizing or any other special programs.  The Constitution either has what is needed, and thus embodies the meaning it was intended to have; or it has been commandeered by racists for a different meaning, and for entirely different purposes. It cannot be both; whites cannot have their cake and eat it too.<br /><br />When black people have confidence that the playing field is fair, they come out of their shell of disgrace and self-destructive behavior to excel.  In fact, there is no evidence to the contrary.  Likewise, when whites see fairness over the horizon, they begin, almost instinctively and always unconsciously, to back up like crabs looking for a place to hide, ways to cut corners; in search of angles to play and advantages, privileges, prerogatives, and offsets to use to give themselves an edge.  Just as blacks seem to thrive in environments of fairness, whites seem to fear them.<br /><br />Enforcing laws TO THE TEE is a simple systemic ways of building the proper incentives into the system that promote and counteract these inherent tendencies.<br /><br />Professor Jensen sits at the top of my \\"must read\\" list.  Everything he writes is timely, incisive and worth at least five stars.	2005-10-11

When all is said and done, living under the umbrella of a racist society takes a depressing toll on and is inevitably unsettling to us all.  Judging by Michael Eric Dyson's Reader, it seems that the most psychic damage is done to the \\"so-called\\" black intellectual than to anyone else in our society.<br /><br />It is a truism seldom expressed openly that since Freud, there are no more secrets: everything is transparent.  Every hustler's hold card can now be peeked at.<br /><br />Whites, hustling American society have no choice but to live out their lives retreating from the only thing that gives them a sense of meaning and identity, their only rallying cry to group solidarity: the long dark self-defining shadow of white supremacy. They have nowhere to hide; it defines them; it is the only (inner or outer) garment they have. It is who they are.  It defines the parameters of their humanity.<br /><br />They are condemned to defend its evils whether they want to or not: forever trying to innocently (and with great detachment and no sense of taint) explain why it happened; ever wishing and hoping that no one looks at all the tangible and intangible perks, advantages, prerogatives and privileges they still accrue from it.  And pretending not to remember that this unmitigated evil of inhumanity remains the gravity that controls the American cultural universe.<br /><br />From an early age, the indispensable life skill for whites (even today, as it was at the founding of this nation), is forgetting that everything meaningful they value and believe in has already been fatally compromised and corrupted by, or remains inextricably tied to a six hundred-year culture of racism.<br /><br />Whites must learn at an early age to deny (or worse yet, how to be content living with) the fact that beyond racism, there is nothing else to \\"being white.\\"  Through racism, whites have raped their own humanity from the inside out:  Nothing meaningful is left but excuses, bombast, false claims and the elevation and objectification of superiority by fiat.  In the end, it is all so much smoke and mirrors. Racism has made American humanity a smoldering dessert. Only the outer shell of humane existence remains.  Look at what happened in New Orleans with hurricane Katrina?<br /><br />Why can't black intellectuals like Dyson and Cornel West come out and say this, straight up?  Why are they always pussyfooting around the edges, teasing us; pretending that they want to be us; want to represent us.  They want to be everything to us:  They are all preachers, rappers, graduates of the \\"hood,\\" etc. ad infinitum.  [Freud would have a lot to say about all this internal confusion of our black intellectuals.]<br /><br />I'll tell you why they cannot say it, because for blacks, the existential reality (and crisis) of living under the shadow of racism is even more complicated than for whites.  We must, one and all, live out the duality W.E.B. du Bois warned us about; inevitably coming to realize and then eventually admitting to ourselves that we are both the \\"subjects\\" and \\"objects\\" of this \\"intentional man made American\\" evil.<br /><br />The largest problem for blacks at all rungs of the class ladder (from Dyson's jailed brother to his own life in the ivory league towers) is coming to grips with the fact that being \\"in\\" America is not quite the same as being \\"of\\" America.  And that quite frankly, there has yet to be worked out a formula for finally resolving this national existential dilemma.<br /><br />Those at the bottom of that socio-economic ladder seem to have less of a problem accepting and then living with this reality.  They know somehow through societal osmosis that most of America is a carefully orchestrated sham.  There is no melting pot. America's puffed up and false claims about democracy, equality and freedom, etc. whether viewed in Dyson's terms of context, subtext, and pretext; or whether just intuited from everyday experiences on the streets are little morethan expressions of white internal and personal weaknesses projected onto the larger national screen.<br /><br />Poor blacks surrender to this racist reality because they accept the fact that they are just too weak to do otherwise.  They don't get caught up in believing in any white nonsense or fantasizing about their own personal relationship to it; they just deal with it as best they can and go on trying to carve out a meaningful life.<br /><br />However, for Black intellectuals and the black upper classes more generally, it is quite a more complicated matter.  Even though they too must realize at some level that they will forever only be \\"in\\" and not \\"of\\" America, they are nevertheless desperately rehearsing for the day they will become full members in good standing in the great white hero system. This yearning is palpable and is a very ugly spectacle.<br /><br />Pretending to forget that it cannot be done (at least not without the self-defeating result of advancing the causes of racism: look at Condoleeza Rice and Clarence Thomas for example). These intellectuals forge ahead nevertheless, reciting their bios and singing out their resumes and curriculum vitas as they go, so that whites can clearly distinguish them from \\"those other blacks.\\"<br /><br />They are ever engaging in pseudo and meaningless debates on abstract ideas of democracy and political theory; engaging in literary criticism and matters of letters and the arts; serving as high officials in and consultants to the government and industry; and otherwise acting as if they were \\"under\\" rather than \\"outside\\" the great white tent.  They do this only to prove to whites and to themselves that they are worthy of being dubbed \\"honorary whites,\\" if only during the day.<br /><br />The deeper they find themselves trapped in the belly of this self-annihilating existential beast, the more denial is required of them.<br /><br />Michael Eric Dyson follows to a tee the well-worn script of the well-paid black intellectual, in residence. Intellectually he is the real deal:  He is bright articulate, well read and OVER-understands the America of which he speaks.<br /><br />But he too is intellectually and culturally, conflicted (and need I say compromised; that is bought and paid for).  The result is a confusing kind of  self-censorship.  Like his conflicted mentor and intellectual hero Cornel West, Dyson knows where the waters edge is and knows when and how to pull his punches.  Although these essays are VERY GOOD they are nothing if not a study in \\"how to pull ones intellectual punches.\\"<br /><br />He doesn't want to \\"speak power to racism;\\" so much as to \\"go on tour with it.\\"  Like \\"three card monty,\\" racism is the only real game in town and the name of the game if you are \\"the token\\" in the ivory towers of the university is to milk that cow man, milk it; don't unveil it; don't help destroy it; don't fight it; don't make the white power structure too uncomfortable with it; just milk it.<br /><br />Say anything you like so long as you don't shake the money tree too hard.  Don't say \\"white racism;\\" say racism.  Admit that there was racism in the past but only progress today. Be politically correct: there is no difference between racism and all of the other \\"isms.\\"  Put them all into the same bag. Stay on the abstract plane, don't get to specific and everything will be all right.  The black masses won't know the difference anyway --especially if you continue to  preach, rap, swagger and praise Jesus and some black woman for all of your success. If you do this all will be right with the world.<br /><br />And don't forget, if your rhetoric allows whites to sleep at night, to continue enjoying their ill-gotten gains with equanimity, you too might yet get your ticket punched and who knows, you might even end up permanently under the tent of the \\"Great White Hero System\\" yourself.<br /><br />Five stars.	2005-09-08

Identity and Being arise out of ones own intentionality and the actions and choices that follow, all of which constitute the true (and only) raw materials of being.<br /><br />It is in his exploration of the ways in which we retreat from our choice to be free -- what he calls our inherent \\"bad faith\\" and lack of authenticity about our utter aloneness -- that he begins to connect and make what would otherwise be a purely academic and speculative abstract system into a powerful set of emotional truths.<br /><br />A student of Husserl and an admirer of Heidegger, Sartre has seemingly succeeded in merging and then enlarging upon their ideas, forging them into his own -- arguably, more consistent and more coherent philosophical whole. The end result is an all-encompassing theory of being, which is a fusion of Husserl's \\"theory of being-unto-death\\" and Heidegger's \\"being-unto-other.\\"<br /><br />In Sartre's ontology of being, consciousness is an a priori philosophical state: an existential blank slate, upon which form and essence must be written: in short, consciousness is the ultimate tabula rasa: the vantage point from which the whole is to be viewed (and thus cannot itself be viewed). To use his own words: Consciousness is \\"beyond freedom.\\" Consciousness is that tableau upon which all meaning is written; from which all essences are derived, and to which all meaning is resolved and inevitably and eventually must return.<br /><br />But as a phenomenon, he does not see consciousness as a thing, or an entity at all but as a complex set of mental processes, which in the end are mere byproducts of brain functioning. The true seat of being in Sartre's phenomenology lies in the authenticity with which one faces the internal truth about his own isolation, desolation and aloneness: that is how man addresses being thrown into the universe without a God to struggle to create an identity -- or to construct his own \\"coming into Being.\\"<br /><br />Heroism is the reward for an authentic life (for facing straight up, the choice to be); a life of fear and neurosis is the opposite: the penalty for retreating from authenticity and thus from true freedom.<br /><br />Even if it sometimes lack clarity, few books have the power and emotional impact that Being and Nothingness has.  It is a classic still worth reading.  Five stars.	2005-09-02

Once again, Dr. Wilkins has demonstrated his immense talents for mature, patriotic, deep thinking and eloquent writing.  As he did in his autobiographical memoir he has again confronted the \\"mother\\" of all American problems; the beast that remains coiled in the nation's bosom: the history and practice of racism, and its companion and handmaiden, racist hypocrisy.<br /><br />By unraveling the moral and existential ambiguity and complexity these issues set up in the personal lives of our four most revered forefathers (what he refers to as the Virginia quartet), he has peered through the dense jungle of patriotic myths and stared this beast squarely in the eyes.<br /><br />By bringing more clearly into focus what they were thinking and how they acted on issues of race and slavery, Wilkins has demythologized Washington, Madison, Mason, and Jefferson, and in the process has forever elevated them above the plane of mere racist adulation and rationalization.  He has done more.  He has in the process \\"re-humanized\\" them, and has given us, not less, but more, reasons to revere them.  For this feat alone he must be lauded.  It is no mean trick to be able to accomplish this.<br /><br />However, had he stopped there, I would have no qualms with this manuscript.  But he tried to do more -- perhaps too much more.<br /><br />Professor Wilkins' ultimate goal seemed to have been to square the circle between the immense theoretical contributions made by these men in the political sphere on the one hand, and the utter destructive legacy bequeathed to us as a result of their personal weaknesses in the social sphere, on the other.<br /><br />Just as we still live under the political freedoms provided by the former, we also continue to live under the social destructiveness and scourges of the latter. Just as the Constitution is a direct legagy of these patriots, so to is the racism that we have come to know in everyday practice a direct result of their hypocrisy.<br /><br />Despite failing at his goal, we must all be grateful to the author for the clarity with which he demonstrated through historical juxtaposition the contradictory (if not fatal) qualities in each of these founding patriots. He did it with grace, without even a hint of malice or bitterness and with great skill and honesty.<br /><br />My concern is with the calculus he has used to try to revolve these human contradictions, the calculus with which he tried to square the circle: by adding them together.  How reasonable it must have seemed to the author that the good in these men should, in the end \\"be made\\" to cancel out the bad.<br /><br />But may I ask: of what good is it to raise the skeleton of slavery from the historical closet if it is only to be re-clothed in a different colored garment of the same old pedigree of exaggerated mythmaking?  How easy it is to make such a mistake in a country where we desperately need more genuine heroes worthy of our adulation.<br /><br />But, if history has taught us anything, it is that moral complexity and existential ambiguity cannot be reduced to a simple additive calculus:  The good, even in our most revered heroes, will never quite completely cancel out the bad.<br /><br />Unless, and until, theory is put into practice the good and the bad forever remain in different orbits.  They remain in two different but parallel universes.  Greatness is not to be found in the mere careful juxtaposition of good and evil, but in eliminating the latter, the evil.<br /><br />Although each of these theoretical giants saw the handwriting on the wall:  That is, conceptually they each knew that slavery, racism and freedom could not long coexist, and could even possibly serve to destroy this country.<br /><br />Yet despite this, none among them had the moral courage to face this reality -- if only to possibly head it off.  As a result, despite the lovely embroidery that Professor Wilkins has fashioned here, the Virginia quartet will forever remain theoretical giants and moral pigmies.  Every American, and especially every Native and Black America must read this book.  Five stars.	2005-08-18

Then surely an order of magnitude increase in the cost of medical care and prescription drugs, and the quintupling of our health insurance (for those of us who have any), should be.<br /><br />Or, one might have imagined that the juxtaposition of soaring corporate profits (in these very same areas) with an effective reduction in \\"actual wages\\" everywhere else, would also have shaken us from our deep collective slumber?<br /><br />Or maybe the fact that we have been led into yet another war for no defensible reasons and without either an exit strategy or a fighting plan -- a war whose justifications and rationale keeps changing with each increased attack from the terrorists as our national debt continues to soar -- would have shaken us out of our passivity.<br /><br />While our government's response to the needs of the \\"rank-and-file\\" is increasingly non-existent, or completely ineffectual, and the \\"managerial class\\" continues to rob us blind as they laugh all the way to the bank; we are obsessed with the risk of breast implants, abortion rights, hanging the Ten Commandments in the public square, reality shows (that are anything but real), Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, and how to continue to win at the game of \\"Democrats and Republicans (or liberals and conservatives, or Blacks versus Whites, or males versus females, or pick your own senseless emotional dichotomy).\\"<br /><br />But the very best evidence yet of our lack of consciousness and proof that our society is being thrown under the bus while we watch in horror with our eyes wide open, is when the most devastating critique of our own slothfulness is also the sanest, most compassionate and most eloquent.<br /><br />Saul in this trenchant sanity check of the society that leads the Western World realizes that the time for vitriol and shouting has long since passed.  That is why with eloquence, understated passion and with measured but devastating logic and reason (that quality he so distrusts), he has issued a broadside at the foundation stone of what ails our society most: Rampant and immoral Corporatism.<br /><br />And even though in the end, his prescription for how we are to extricate ourselves from this dilemma is unconvincing, he has laid the necessary groundwork for serious thinking to begin.  If \\"the people\\" in Western Democracies are ever to regain control of their minds, and then eventually their societies; Saul's ideas in this small volume must inevitably be contended with.

However, the best review of these three analytic essays, appear in the introduction to the book.  Nothing I, or anyone, could say can improve on that.  However it is important to note a few things about the book.<br /><br />Professor Patterson, an ex-Marxist turned Harvard Sociology Professor is nothing if not daring, brave, almost intrepid.  He is fearless in choosing as his topic one of sociology's most pressing and most difficult problems: getting at the roots of the problem of race in America.<br /><br />He performs a dangerous high-wire act (without a net) in this three-ring sociological circus and does so with commitment, grace and aplomb.  This book is an obvious labor of love for a professional whose job is to advance the frontiers and boundaries of his profession, and in order to do that one must be prepared to take some risks, and in this volume, Dr. Patterson does so in scads. He takes methodological risks, logical risks, political risks, professional risks, and most of all theoretical risks.<br /><br />That he does not always succeed - and indeed at times crashes and burns - is almost beside the point.  In the end you know that you have been on an exhilarating ride that is worth far more than the few flaws in the book.<br /><br />In fact it is almost embarrassing to attempt to critique such elegant analyses because they are such good examples of what is needed; because there are just too many sociological trails that need blazing; because the boundaries of sociological analysis needs more of this kind of testing; and because all of the social sciences need more pioneers of Dr. Patterson's caliber.<br /><br />Having said that it must also be said that the author has committed at least one category one error in the first essay.<br /><br />In it he uses as his interpretive database, the anecdotal evidence (mostly hearsay) of Black feminist writers and victims, (almost always one and the same) of alleged black male perfidy as the foundation of his analysis.  Then this theme is repeated and propagated throughout the various pieces.<br /><br />Doing this is of course a methodologically elementary \\"no-no,\\" especially when such data is not balanced or offset by an equal an opposite amount of similar data from the black male side of the equation.  Black feminist views are taken as givens and as ground truth, and thus go unexamined and unchallenged. Used in this way they become a great foil in relieving pressures of having to implicate the larger culture of any responsibility for racism.  (In this restricted way America's racism reduces to a kind of intramural sport, an intra-black thing.)<br /><br />The problem with relying on such a questionable data source is that all biases remain in complete alignment with those of the larger black male hating American society.  When coupled with the hidden and unacknowledged variable of \\"white normality\\" which serves, de facto, as the sole context for these analyses, the results are predictable and all but self-fulfilling.<br /><br />For all its virtues, the scent of tautology hangs heavily in the air over the first essay.  But all of this should not have been a conundrum for the analysis.  It all can be explained simply:  It points to a much larger and deeper flaw of most racial analyses conducted in the U.S.  The name of the game is not to follow the data and hypotheses wherever they may lead, (because we know where that trail always ends), but one of \\"who is to be exonerated of responsibility for America's racial problems, first?\\"<br /><br />Invariably, no matter how complex and sophisticated the rationalization and explanations may appear, the person left holding the bag is always the favorite targets of America's racist society.  Put differently, all roads will invariably lead back to the black male as being both the victim and the culprit of American society.  And most of all, he will be charged with the responsibility for creating the circumstances for his own failed conditions.  From this vantage point, methodologically, the problem of the black male is unconnected to any existing structures.  It is completely detached and thus is sui generis.<br /><br />But all this \\"analytic chasing of ones own tail\\" does is point to another deeper unexamined level of the problem: the psycho-social and sexual dimensions of racism in American culture.  It is only at this level that the leitmotifs of Professor Patterson's analyses -- violence, religion, sex, and myths based almost exclusively on primitive fears - meet and come into focus.  Too bad Dr. Patterson's intrepidity did not move him enough to stumble over this fence just once.<br /><br />Unless this level is penetrated, everything else is just so much academic window dressing.  One cannot analyze race in America without peeping behind the screen of white normality, any more than one can analyze German hatred of the Jews by blaming Adolph Hitler.  Hatred does not just inhere in racist cultures it defines them and they are in turn defined by it.<br /><br />Germans massacred six million Jews not because of a gang of criminals running the government but because the German population by its collective acquiescence, demanded it.  Just as American culture is anti-Black, pre war German culture was anti-Jewish through and through.  Everyone knew it but preferred to censor their collective brain and remained in denial about this fact until it was too late.<br /><br />The over-arching theme that remains unstated in these analyses is that the same is occurring in America with respect to blacks.  In America, it is okay to call a spade a spade so long as it does not implicate the collective white majority in seeking, at all costs, to maintain their privileges, advantages, and prerogatives of being white.  These are the unfortunate \\"givens\\" of American society.<br /><br />If there is a great Ku Klux Klan in the sky, it is existential, not historical.  It is called the passive-aggressive collective American conscience.<br /><br />What professor Patterson has done here is heroic, magical, and exquisite craftsmanship.  This book will shake your soul at its foundation.  Buy this book and learn what America needs to do about its race problem.  Five stars.	2005-05-12

Although I first read it in the 1980s, it still is current and continues to convey complex and timeless knowledge about the mind in an understandable, non-polemic, yet in an eclectic and fresh way.<br /><br />The volume is dense but segmented into bite-sized frames with diagrams and pictures that intentionally take the content out into the third dimension and makes it less formidable.  And although it is segmented into bite-sized frames, the reader's appetite for learning about the concepts of psychology -- from Gregory Bateson, Freud, Rollo May to Ernest Becker and Otto Rank -- will be more than satisfied.<br /><br />The leitmotif of the volume is the idea of connectedness.  There are three messages: Humanity is about wholeness; survival of the planet is about wholeness; and living a rich and full life is about self-knowledge and wholeness.<br /><br />It covers the waterfront of what we knew about human psychology and the mind up to the 1980s.  And although the frontiers of psychology have moved ahead somewhat, the book was so far ahead of its times that even 25 years later it remains fresh and current.<br /><br />It is an academic tour de force that leaves a deep impression on the reader and is a book that has been an invaluable companion to me in my writings.  Ten stars.	2005-04-23
US	52249576	RWOMUY71NCXT9	0974548405	736823355	Final Judgment: The Missing Link in the JFK Assassination Conspiracy	Books	5	140	158	N	N	The Truth has its own Resonance	The Second Review<br /><br />The author's data could not have been stronger or more convincing at tying together the two halves of his thesis: Many of the founders of Israel and its security services were implicated through Permindex of first attempting to assassinate Charles De Gaulle for failing to resist Algerian independence. And then later implicated in an attempt to kill JFK for meddling in Israel's nuclear developments.<br /><br />According to this author, both plots were hatched by the Mossad, in coordination with French and American intelligence. In each case, Permindex was used as a cut-out to finalize the details of the assassinations.Like the rest of us, the late Michael Collins Piper, too had his hypothesis about who killed JFK? It was the not unreasonable thesis that one of America's main power centers was missing as a suspect -- namely, organizations representing Jewish-American political influence -- like the ADL, Meyer Lansky's branch of the mob and the Mossad, perhaps in combination with the CIA, the Italian mob and Texas Oil barons -- Piper surmised, may also have played a role in the slaying of JFK.<br /><br />Admitting that he failed to find a smoking gun, Piper proceeds to test this speculative &#34;stab in the dark&#34; hypothesis even though it maintains the strong scent of anti-Semitism. But I must say that even as an avowed non-anti-Semite, it is my judgment that while the author may be a questionable researcher, since he restricted his data search only to areas that tended to prove his thesis, that alone does not necessarily make him a racist-inspired anti-Semite.<br /><br />That said, the value of his overall product must be judged not on whether he is or is not an anti-Semite, but on what the data he marshaled together to prove his thesis actually reveal. If it turns out that Mr. Piper's research is tainted with anti-Semitism, yet still gets us closer to the truth, then so be it.<br /><br />At the time this book went to print, there wassuch a paucity of  promising hypotheses about who committed the assassination, that I was ready to accept almost any thesis that challenged the USG's CIA and FBI's inspired disinformation campaign, a campaign clearly  deployed to flood the JFK assassination literature.<br /><br />This campaign of course excluded the only thesis that remained outside this bodyguard of carefully arranged state-sanctioned lies. Namely, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's theory that the CIA was the most likely culprit because, along with the mob, anti-Castro renegades, and Texas oil, only it had the means, money and motivation to not only commit the murder, but also to cover it up for nearly three generations. No one had given much thought to the Jewish axis as a possibility until Piper took it up as a project.<br /><br />Moreover, unconscionably, the USG, of which the CIA and the FBI are components, were complicit in the JFK murder if for no other reason than that they both tried to squash Garrison's investigation? So far, I know of no innocent reasons for blocking an independent investigation unless the USG itself was complicit in either the murder, the coverup, or both?<br /><br />Piper's thesis gained considerable face validity as it took up where Jim Garrison's investigation left off. In particular, Piper used Garrison's Permindex thread to unravel an explosive Israeli connection. It turns out that this shadowy intelligence shell, was not only an Israeli creation, but also a much used &#34;cut-out&#34; for a number of intelligence services, who used it as their operational base, as an ATM for paying operators, as well as for a multitude of other nefarious functions, including political assassinations.<br /><br />Piper's thesis can be divided into two parts: First that Israel had an existential motive to kill JFK because he was single-handedly bent on dismantling Israel's nuclear program. JFK had so badgered Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion about allowing the US toinspect Israel's Desert facilities at Demona -- long suspected of being a nuclear weapons development facility -- that Ben Gurion resigned his post under protest and devoted his life to a clandestine vendetta against JFK, a vendetta which, according to Piper, eventually bore fruit by blossoming into the JFK assassination.<br /><br />The second part of his thesis shows that this mysterious entity, Permindex, was indeed an Israeli/ Mossad creation, one whose oversight organization was once managed by contract CIA agent Clay Shaw, the only man ever to be officially charged with JFK's assassination.<br /><br />In this book, Piper essentially continues the job Garrison failed to complete by showing that Shaw was indeed not only a contract CIA employee, but also the director of a suite of international Trade Marts, run out of Permindex, that included both the one in New Orleans, where Lee Harvey Oswald (LHO) was photographed handing out pro-Castro flyers, as well as the Dallas Trade Mart, where JFK was enroute to speak when he was cut down by a triangulated cross fire. So, Shaw was ideally positioned to coordinate the assassination.<br /><br />The summer before the assassination, LHO was being groomed as the &#34;pasty&#34; by a virulent anti-Castro ex-FBI agent named Guy Bannister. Together with David Ferry and a host of other unsavory anti-Castro and anti-Kennedy Bay-of Pigs renegades that included the Meyer Lansky branch of the mob, LHO was ensconced together with them in a virtual viper's nest of CIA intrigue involving anti-Castro terrorist activity emanating from bases near New Orleans.<br /><br />The author's data could not have been more convincing at tying together the two halves of his thesis: Many of the founders of Israel and its security services were implicated through Permindex of first attempting to assassinate Charles De Gaulle for failing to resist Algerian independence. And then later to kill JFK for meddling in Israel's nuclear developments.<br /><br />According to this author, both plots were hatched by the Mossad, in coordination with French and American intelligence respectively. In each case, Permindex was used as a cut-out to finalize the details of the assassinations.<br /><br />The weakest part of Piper's thesis is that his research only proves that Israel may have played a custodial role, but was not necessarily an active participant in the arrangements that ended in the assassination.<br /><br />Despite this, I stand by my earlier review that this is the best analysis of the JFK assassination yet to be done. However, this may not be true for very long, as new data emerges every week, and more robust theories may yet be expected to be coming down the pike. Surely someone is going to eventually write a book about the meaning of the three memos J.Edgar Hoover dropped like a time bomb into the middle of the JFK archives? Still five stars<br /><br />Beginning of the first review<br /><br />As one who has read over 200 books on the JFK Assassination, and engaged in research both as an individual and as part of various teams, I can say without fear of contradiction that Piper's book is now the definitive work on the JFK Assassination. &#34;Final Judgement&#34; is the most thorough, most honest, most penetrating, most factual, and most analytically complete and systematic of all that I have read so far.<br /><br />The author builds an upwardly spiralling tapestry of well documented facts that connect the threads of the conspiracy as they ascend level by level from the ground up to the very tip of the pyramid. Along the way, he breaks the conspiracy into easily digestible parts. Otherwise its sheer complexity would be nearly impossible to follow and decipher. At each level, the threads of the puzzle are woven together in such a way that the fog from the labyrinth is slowly but inexorably lifted until eventually it is peeled back completely and the outlines of the conspiracy are laid bare. What is revealed is as convincing as it is scary. Someday America will have to face some unplesant truths about its democracy and about how it has been, and continues to be manipulated, if not completely comandeered by those whose primary loyalties lie elsewhere.<br /><br />While the links at some of the levels may be tenuous, the author refuses to &#34;fake or fudge the data&#34; or to be &#34;fatally selective&#34; in what is included or left out as many have charged was the case in the Warren Commission's own report. Piper is intrepid in following his analysis to every logical conclusion--wherever they lead and whatever the implications may be. In short, Piper keeps his eye on the donout (&#34;Big Picture&#34;) and not on the hole (inessential details). he focuses on the &#34;why and how&#34; of the conspiracy and unmistakeably the threads all lead back to Israel, Israeli super-patriots, the Myer Lanskey led &#34;Jewish branch of the mob,&#34; and the Massad and the international &#34;agents of influence&#34; under its control.<br /><br />While serious researchers may quibble with inessential details in the study, such as tenuous links at some levels, or redundancies at others, those of us who have studied this issue since the days after the assassination always knew that the truth would have its own resonance--like the Garrison investigation did. We knew that the truth would have its own context, its own smell, like Peter Dale Scott's &#34;Deep Politics and the Death of JFK&#34; did. Piper's book has them all and in the grand tradition of Carl Oglesby's &#34;Yankee Cowboy War,&#34; Micheal Piper has struck gold. He has hit the &#34;mother lode,&#34; and in the process has pointed the finger at, if not tightened the proverbial noose around, the necks of the cabal of conspirators responsible for pulling the strings (and triggers) of the JFK assassination.<br /><br />JFK assassination research has a new standard bearer. It will never be the same again. Because of this book, future researchwill begin to focus more on the &#34;big picture,&#34; and turn away from constantly grinding, ad nauseam, at inconsistencies in the Warren Commission's Report.	2005-03-17

The Posner explanation is not just comical it is also down right insulting to the intelligence of the American people.<br /><br />On the second issue, Posner agrees with the Warren Commission's myths about Ruby even though a lot more was known about Ruby at the time Posner's manuscript was written.<br /><br />On the third issue, Posner takes the easy way out and implies that Garrison was a lunatic and that his New Orleans investigation was worthless.  However, if this were so, why would the government work so vigorously to undermine and undercut it?  However flawed Garrison's investigation may have been it was still in search of the same truth that the government was ostensibly engaged in, was it not?  Why did Posner not explain why the government failed to join forces with Garrison and pursue parallel investigations?  State and Federal agencies do this all the time on much smaller cases.<br /><br />Also, since Posner's manuscript was written Barr McClellan's book Blood Money and Power has taken a different twist on the assassination, which if true would render Posner's book not only wrong but also irrelevant.<br /><br />Judging by the title, I thought this would be the definitive work on the JFK assassination.  However, I was wrong and thus was very disappointed.The book that now deserves to be read in my view is Michael Collin Piper's book called Final Judgment.<br /><br />One star.	2005-03-17

Senator Obama is a \\"truth teller\\" who has taken us yet another step further down the path to understanding who we Americans really are as a people. His version of the truth is not an unfamiliar one but IS one told with much grace and style.<br /><br />Barack's family odyssey is a magic carpet ride through space and time; across color lines into different cultures, backgrounds and walks of life, a literary daydream that traipse the globe at the speed of life but that finally and abruptly returns us full circle back to ground zero and ground truth: to the ghettos of Chicago, the housing projects, Altgeld, which, in so many ways, is but a symbolic leitmotif of a world that seem systematically to be losing what remains of its humanity.<br /><br />One can try to decipher and then argue about the motives for such a book: to exorcise the demons of the timelessly troubled father-son dynamic (or through Freudian interpolation, the equally troubled mother-son dynamic); to unfurl the internal pain, isolation, alienation and uncertainty of having no choice in being flung into a racially bifurcated life in a land where pretenses about racial pedigree seem to be all that really matters; to show that no matter where you land in this world, race does indeed matter -- especially if you are young, Black and male; or that a good education and a commitment to something larger than oneself are the true equalizers in a world of irretrievably distorted and declining values, and ever-diminishing humanity.<br /><br />Take you pick, whatever is your final answer you will discover that Obama's motives touch his humanity in places and in ways that make us all think more deeply and feel more human; and they always remain complex and compelling. For these universal reasons, the book will endure and deserves a place along side such classics as Alex Haley's Roots.<br /><br />Beyond the text itself the book has a deeper and somewhat more unsettling meaning. Because if Obama does nothing else he shows us that his life is an object lesson in what it means to be an aware citizen of this world.  If he does nothing more he proves that he knows his way around; that he knows the score. He has earned a right to have his views heard. But too much awareness in this world can be a dangerous and unsettling thing.<br /><br />The lessons of Hawaii, Indonesia, Chicago, New York, Harvard and Kenya is that realities and truths of this life will either hit you in the face or in \\"the behind:\\" there is no place to hide; no place for feigned innocence; no place for fantasy or denial. As the book puts it (on page 204) \\"Black survival in this country has always been premised on a minimum of delusions...\\"<br /><br />As uncomfortable as straddling the fence of the racial divide has been, it has taught Obama some cruel but very necessary lessons:<br /><br />Chicago taught him that there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow coalition. In most of the known world self-interest, issues, and religiously motivated action is supposed to lead directly to power.  But not so in Chicago. In the ghetto, fear trumps everything including religious values and morals. Fear, poverty and racism degrades in incalculatable and immeasurable ways.<br /><br />Indonesia taught him that even though power in the U.S. is hidden under a veneer of insincere platitudes, political correctness, pseudo-patriotism and pseudo-relgiousity, benign neglect and other forms of state sanctioned hypocrisy, which makes the use of power seem almost people-friendly; it is not so in the Third world.  There, are no pretenses. Power is raw, undisguised, indiscriminate and arbitrary.  The only way to make peace with power in the Third World is to hand over your humanity or your life.  There are no subtleties, no nuances, no political correctness, no substitutes, and no margin for error.  In the Third world, Barack's stepfather Lolo showed that you can't beat the system by playing the angles and operating independently aroundthe margins.  No. Appeals to moral suasion do not work; logic doesn't work either.  The choices are nepotism, revolution or a life of permanent oppression, poverty and quiet despair existing as a lower form of humanity.<br /><br />Kenya taught him that there is an ironclad law of human nature: Even when Blacks win, they always lose.  Just as Post-Reconstruction turned newly-won freedom into a new kind of slavery for Black Americans, so too did independence turn Black Africa into a continuation of colonialism by other means. There too, as in America, can be found Uncle Toms, compromisers, the lackeys of the white dying colonial power structure and Black hypocrites who will sell their souls for a dollar.  Across the Third World, as on the streets of Detroit and Chicago, the echo chamber of poverty and despair can be heard in neighborhoods with too many single Black women having too many unwanted babies, with too few fathers; and in large cities there are too many idle young men of color without the means to become productive citizens.  These men know how to act even when they do not know how to be.<br /><br />In New York he learned that racism, sexism and class are all different sides of the same old chauvinistic coin. Everybody talks about their pet \\"ism\\" but no one does a thing about any of them -- especially not about the deep reservoir of racism that lies seething just beneath that city's consciousness.<br /><br />The book's ultimate truth is that Barack knows that his own \\"individual advancement,\\" no matter how high he might eventually rise, is unlikely to affect the \\"collective decline\\" of the Black race in America.  And if he had not learned that through his own experiences, all he needed to do was to observe the impotency of the likes of Clarence Thomas, Colin (and Michael) Powell, or Condoleeza Rice, and their individual or collective ability to affect the Black condition.<br /><br />As Frank (one of Barack's streetwise mentors) warned him: At Harvard you will have to check your race at the door where you will then be \\"trained\\" rather than \\"educated\\" receiving at the end of your term an \\"advanced degree in compromise.\\" If the above list of \\"well-trained\\" Black leaders is any indication, Obama can expect the U.S. Congress, to be a continuation of the \\"training\\" Frank warned him about.<br /><br />Now that Senator Obama has arrived at the citadel of American power, the U.S. Senate, whether fair or not, this book will be seen as his moral compass; his contract with us -- America; the manifesto of his philosophy of life, a virtual instruction manual for understanding what makes Obama tick: It will be the yardstick against which the new Senator's actions will be measured: In the end we will all see it as the Truth According to Barack Obama.<br /><br />Fair or not, Illinois' newest Senator will be judged by the contents of this book, and by the values and techniques he has laid out in it.<br /><br />He, like the other Junior Senator-the one from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton (who incidentally is also from the Chicago area) has now been sucked into the orbit of the ultimate realm of power, into the cosmic political Black hole of the last standing superpower, where all history begins and ends and where the gravitational pull towards corruption, hypocrisy and \\"selling out\\" to corporate interests seems to have no known bounds. [And so far, no one who has entered has escaped with their morals intact.]<br /><br />The orgy of conservative extremist power that rules Congress today, jeers at the weak; has commandeered all the symbols of religion and state, and has taken over the moral high ground by fiat. It eats its young and takes no prisoners.  There is no friendly turf remaining on which neophytes such as Obama can stand his ground.  The inmates are running the asylum.<br /><br />Even today as we watch the ugly spectacle of the transformation of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ever-\\"triangulating\\" her way down to the least commondenominator to meet the ever-downward demands of the more popular American center, we can literally see her shedding her old democratic values and redefining them downwards to meet the more popular demands of the mindlessly, racist, amoral American center, in her unholy licentious quest for the Crown Jewel of American politics, the American Presidency.<br /><br />Those of us who knew her before she became a rich author, a shamed ex-First lady and a feminist media star, wonder what happened to the ex-warrior for the weak; the outspoken radical who while in college single-handedly took on the establishment status quo? How soon we find new gods to serve and new ways to rationalize that service and our new existence.<br /><br />The same eyes that are watching the moral disintegration of Hillary will also be fixed on Senator Obama's every move.  What will he do?  Will the system eat him alive, or will it change him as it has changed Hillary, or will he change it? Will he continue to support those who fight in the trenches or will he grab the money and glory and run.<br /><br />That is the question this book cannot answer.  Five stars.	2005-03-08
US	52249576	R15H1EMT3JJYQJ	0142003018	698227269	What's So Great About America	Books	4	6	9	N	N	This is a serious essay. Read It!	Despite the one-sidedness one comes to expect of D'Souza's books, this is a serious piece of research. D'Souza's glimpse into the worldview of the Egyptian philosopher Sayyid Qutb and what Qutb has to say about America alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Equally, his discussion of the philosophical basis of American Democracy and the balancing act required by the founding fathers to reach agreement on the Constitution are subtle and nuanced treatments of the topic unlikely to be found in everyday contemporary political writings about the U.S.  -- whether within or outside the US.<br /><br />Also, it is not all bad that under a thin guise of praising America, the author gives us a good bit of tongue-lashing -- a taste of what non-Americans (really) think of us.  Beneath the thin veil of syrupy accolades, he issues a broadside against a long list of contemporary American social evils, a broadside that although it comes without warning, seems richly deserved and most of the times, very constructive. It helps that D'Souza's writing is lively well thought out and enthusiastic.<br /><br />The good news is that his critique centers only on the past two generations of liberal tinkering, which has, as the author rightly points out, been in large part responsible for many of America's current social maladies.  The bad news is that he leaves unscathed the other half of the problem, \\"conservative tinkering\\".<br /><br />Also, one senses a deep inner nervousness when D'Souza discusses issues of race in America.  Even though he has written a decent book on the topic, he is most superficial and least convincing when expounding on the issue of race. I find his racial analysis utterly lacking in depth or sophistication and even of only minimal honesty.<br /><br />Perhaps it is unfair to say so (and I mean no disrespect) but I can only imagine this sensitivity to have more to do with being transposed from Indian Brahmin to designated or honorary American white.  Undoubtedly, transposed Brahmin identity (awarded at birth like whiteness) and sympathies must lie on the side of whiteness. I have no other way of accounting for this gap in D'Souza's otherwise clean and uncompromising thinking.<br /><br />In both this and his book entitled \\"The End of Racism,\\" the author proves that he is a decent researcher even as he fiercely maintains his ideological blinders in the \\"on position.\\" One must shudder to think how much more constructive and useful Mr. D'Souza's contribution would be were he to just once rise above being a Republican ideologue and for once taking off his conservative and Brahmin blinkers.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I am hooked; I will keep reading everything he writes because, if nothing else, D'Souza is maturing.  Sooner rather than later he will become the academic he is struggling to become and I hope to be around when this intellectual explosion occurs.<br /><br />I give the book four stars.	2005-02-10

Where does Psychoanalysis sit in the ontological and espistimological scheme of things?  What is Culture and how does it work in today's real world?

In it, he tackles the preeminent problem of mankind.  What he refers to as \\"the vital lie\\": man's refusal to accept his own lack of immortality.  The author brilliantly, passionately, honestly and convincingly analyzes man's failure to confront his own finititude.<br /><br />Man's denial of the inevitability of death is an attempt to escape the terror of the ultimate fear, to escape the ultimate human psychological debilitation, to evade the ultimate human dilemma.  It is the fear of death that drives him into an existential and ontological black hole, all escapes from which are either temporary or existentially incomplete or dishonest.<br /><br />Since he cannot transcend his mortality, man can only maintain denial at tremendous cost to himself:  his mind.  He is forced to live a life of either meaninglessness or a lie, psychological delusion.  In either case his only choice is the brand of neurosis he will choose.<br /><br />Man, ever the narcissistic being, can assign value and meaning to his life only by making himself a hero in his own symbolically created world, the most important of which is society itself.  In this self-defined, self-created self-contained drama (society's cultural system), man proceeds to create a script for his heroism in his own life project.<br /><br />From the start, this project is doomed to an ignominious existential failure for man has no respectable escapes other than that of facing the truth of his condition and then having to endure the abject terror that implies; or remaining in denial by choosing an appropriate role as hero in his own symbolically created drama.<br /><br />Whether that drama is religious or not is somewhat beside the point since the escape is through the same delusional door.  In either case, achieving heroism in his own self-defined fantasized world, leaves man with the false feeling that he has somehow transcended mortality.It is a monumental lie.<br /><br />In the process of unfolding this drama of man's confrontation with the fear of death, Becker explains a great deal about what we currently understand about the basic human condition.<br /><br />Few books possess the power and clarity of this one.  Six stars!!!!!!<br /><br />Since we actually had at least one President who could and did read, please allow me to share with you the following:<br /><br />Bill Clinton's Review of The Denial of Death<br />(From page 235 of his \\"My Life:\\")<br /><br />\\"I read one book in Acapulco, Ernest Becker's \\"The Denial of Death - heavy reading for a honeymoon, but I was also a year older than my father when he died, and I had taken a big step. It seemed like a good time to keep exploring the meaning of life.<br /><br />According to Becker, as we grow up, at some point we become aware of death, then the fact that people we know and love die, then the fact that someday we, too, will die.  Most of us do what we can to avoid it. Meanwhile, in ways we understand only dimly if at all, we embrace identities and the illusion of self-sufficiency. We pursue activities, both positive and negative, that we hope will lift us above the chains of ordinary existence and perhaps endure after we are gone. All this we do in a desperate push against the certainty that death is our ultimate destiny. Some of us seek power and wealth, others romantic love, sex, or some other indulgence. Some want to be great, others to do good and be good. Whether we succeed or fail, we are still going to die. The only solace, of course is to believe that since we were created, there must be a Creator, one to whom we matter and will in some way return.<br /><br />Where does Becker's analysis leave us? He concludes: \\"Who knows what form the forward momentum of life will take in the time ahead ... The most that any one of us can seem to do is to fashion something - an object or ourselves - and drop it into the confusion, make an offering ofit, so to speak, to the life force.\\" Ernest Becker died shortly before the Denial of Death was published, but seemed to have met Immanuel Kant's test of life: \\"How to occupy properly that place in creation that is assigned to man, and how to learn from it what one must be in order to be a man. I've spent a lifetime trying to do that. Becker's book helped convince me it was an effort worth making.	2004-08-30

This common sense approach to the myriad JFK conspiracy theories has a lot to recommend it.  It is coherent in the extreme.  However, much like Posner's Case Closed, it is very one-sided and long on plausibility and speculation and short on confirmable facts and citations.  To the author's credit, and rather uncannily the book presaged much of what is now confirmed \\"factions\\" in Blood, Money and Power.<br /><br />While the author's scenario holds together extremely well even under a hypothetical criminologist framework, it is nevertheless more \\"structured fantasy\\" than serious investigation or even serious academic research since it rests on a foundation of common sense speculation.<br /><br />However, to his credit, the author makes no pretense of objectivity.  From the start he says LBJ dunnit, and then proceeds to tell us why.  There are many titillating never before explained facts which have the smell of truth, but they are all either hatched from the author's head or cannot be confirmed independently because they are not attributed to any particular source.  That's a pity because this would be a good book to cite, were there any citable facts in it.<br /><br />Three stars for a common sense approach that makes the author's premises and ground rules clear.	2004-08-24

In a completely dispassionate and academic way, and through 12 separate essays, this manuscript first deconstructs the normal understanding of racism and then rebuilds it into one that is not only intellectually more honest but also one that is much more coherent; one that is about as close to an undistorted view of racist reality as we in America are ever likely to get.<br /><br />  The most important contribution of this volume however, even though it goes only part way down this path, is that it turns the spotlight in the other direction: onto whites themselves and on the role they have played in devising an insidious but almost organic system of racism.<br /><br />  The book exposes and then examines in detail the mechanics of American racism comparing and contrasting it with racism in other countries, and the historical motives for its invention and for its continued maintenance.  It goes deep into white rationalizations, fears and insecurities upon which the process of racism is built, and in the end it goes into the damage racism has done to all its victims, including most importantly (and perhaps for the first time acknowledging this), whites themselves.<br /><br />  An unwritten subtext of the volume is that whites, who invented racism to elevate themselves at the expense of, and to exploit and harm others, paradoxically may in the end have become its greatest victims.<br /><br />  For, after all it is their very being and self-concept that rests on the fraudulent and fragile foundation of an ideology of racial superiority.  It is this ideology that has, de facto, become the only white worldview, the white Holy Grail, and the cosmic reason d'etre of whiteness.<br /><br />  The book does not explain what is to happen to whites when this fraudulent existential prop is exposed and the collective denial upon which it depends (one that has so carefully shielded collective white consciousness from its true meaning and consequences), either collapses or simply withers away?<br /><br />  An awesome display of academic prowess and even-handedness.

Yet, these men in their own inimical lonely way-with warts, flaws, inconsistencies and all--tell them anyway.<br />  Yes, this is the rewriting of American history through the self-validating juxtaposition of selective cases.  Yet it is no less American history--a kind of \\"missing American history,\\" like so many other missing parts to American history.  And in this sense, it is either a great deal more, or a lot less, than meets the eye.<br />  What we do see here amidst raw, unvarnished, unalloyed truths is \\"living history\\" told by a handful of lost souls \\"paddling against a strong social current\\" in a veritable sea of orthodox evil called American culture.  Theirs is an attempt to remain relevant by establishing \\"in place\\" a \\"counter hero system\\"-one in which the loss humanity of an entire nation can in some way be restored to a new level recognizable as normal by the rest of humanity.  [These lonely white men then of course become super heroes in a much larger and more human system.]<br />  What these \\"lost souls\\"--choosing to \\"opt\\" out of the much-flawed \\"white male American hero system\\" show--if only in relief--is their own futility and the utter futility of trying to \\"buck in place\\" an evil and corruptly based system.<br />  Each man discovers in his own lonely but inevitable way that it can't be done; yet they persist as the sacrificial lambs they know themselves to be--because along the way there are truths to be told-and boy do they tell them:<br />--To be human, something has to feed the soul.<br />--Whiteness is an oppressive and expensive fiction that gives unearned privileges to some but does so at a very, very high price: by falsifying a much more complicated social reality and by robbing the society of its humanity.<br />--Racism is above being personal; it is deeply social.<br />--America is one big training camp for bigots.<br />--Racism, sexism, and homophobia do not a culture make.<br />--Poor white men are wounded, needy, powerless, and need to have their identities validated too.  If they don't get it, they know how to act--even when they do not know how to \\"be\\".<br />--The world over, young disenfranchised men are the catalysts for raising hell because being male means knowing how to be raise hell.<br />  These are just a just a few nuggets of a virtual book of undeniable but often, unseen truths. Yet there is so much more tragedy than hope in these little gems of this very heady tome:<br />--You cannot withdraw from a bankrupt, corrupt \\"evil system\\" even if you try, because it is in fact a \\"system\\" and therein lies the rub: within it there is no other platform on which to stand and counter the evil it propagates.  You either become a part of the system or you become irrelevant.<br />--No one exits (or even coexists) within an evil system (even in one's own mind) without paying an unacceptable price-that is without being irreparable affected by its inconsistencies, its inhumanity and its corruption-in short without being consumed by it.<br />--In the end reality is just consensual perceptions--a very low standard upon which to build a life-affirming humanity.<br />  Is the thought that we can get outside such a system mere denial at a much deeper (higher) level?  Is it flawed thinking to imagine that a more human (less evil) \\"hero system\\" can be built \\"in place\\" inside an evil and already corrupt hero system?  Is it just wishful thinking, to image that one's humanity can be restored by \\"pumping up\\" what remains of it in a bankrupt system?  Do these 35 brave testimonies, by those who elect to live outside American social orthodoxy, have any meaning at all within it?  Or is it like telling a Baptist why it is evil to be baptized?  Or is this volume just more \\"liberal mind-massaging equally racist denial\\" cloaked in the perennial package of \\"doing good\\" for the community?<br />  Read thebook and draw your own conclusions. No matter what conclusions you draw, your conscience will be shaken.  Four stars.	2004-07-17

This an awesomely clear and well written book. I give it six stars.<br />In his effort to shed some light on a difficult problem, the so-called \\"black problem,\\" Mr. Kelley has used his well-honed craft as a journalist, deftly.  He deserves credit for shinning the spotlight in many of the dark places in black culture (and on some of its most sacred of \\"sacred cows\\") where it is sorely needed-especially on the moribund black church, lack of an overall cultural strategy, and by picking holes in all of the past half-baked tactics.  He correctly demonstrates that even when blacks win, they eventually lose.<br />However, importantly, he fails to give us the answer to the most perplexing question of all, why this is always the case?<br />By exposing the nakedness of the HNIC, the last Emperor of an otherwise dying black culture, he all but puts the last nail in a coffin that surely appears to need being shut forever.  Instead of nearing the finish line of the last mile of freedom, Kelly demonstrates (whether he intended to or not) that black cultural chaos and self-destruction is all that there is as far out into the future as the eye can see.<br />There is a minor problem however with Mr. Kelly's astutely crafted analysis.  How is it that while walking very slowly down the path to their last mile of freedom, the great minds of black intellectual culture have all made the same wrong turn in the fork in the road?  Why have they all turned down the well-lighted path of collective cultural self-destruction?<br />Mr. Kelly's analysis does not ask or answer this question.<br />How easy it is to beat a dead (black) horse, which is also what Mr. Kelly, accuses the \\"Black Conservatives\\" of doing.  How easy it is to fall back into one's own comfort zone of orthodoxy (and become a part of HNIC royalty oneself)-which is what he accuses the black liberals of doing.  How easy it is to see all of the flaws when cultural sausage is being made without a recipe...<br />It seems that Mr. Kelly's analysis itself has committed the same error that he has accused the other great minds of having committed:  He has failed to recognize when a paradigm shift is needed.<br /><br />The paradigm shift that is needed has to do with the inadvertent missing link in Mr. Kelly's analysis.  It turns out to be the only controlling variable that remains unaccounted for:  It is called white racism.  Yes, I know one has to be careful in using this variable.  Black orthodoxy dictates that overuse makes one either an irrelevant cultural nationalist rebel or an impotent excuse-maker or rationalizer. Under-use, on the other hand, makes one either a \\"soft,\\" or a \\"hard\\" Uncle Tom, an appeaser, a compromiser with evil.<br />But correct use makes for sound analysis.<br />In the face of all evidence to the contrary, Mr. Kelly would have us believe that by treating only one half of America's race problem (the black half), the \\"elusive effective most efficacious black strategy\\" does in fact exist and will in fact be found.  His candidate is the old familiar composite-better organizational and programmatic planning, more strategic thinking--and by all means and without further delay more black forays into economic independence and internal self-development.<br />Mr. Kelly's book proves simply that at times even great minds can become fuzzy when they refuse to look at the simple truths facing them head on.  Following Mr. Kelly's well-worn paradigm to black success, one would think that with Oprah, professional basketball, the Johnson publishing and Jackson music and BET broadcasting empires, the black economy would be well on its way to democratic and racial acceptance and thus to victory.  That is, that the last mile of freedom should already have been accomplished.  QED, amen.<br />Here is a mind game that Mr. Kelly evidently did not think to play. It is the same mind game that Howard Griffin played in his famous book \\"Black Like Me.\\"  Supposed Bill Gates, and Andrew Carnegie were black (or pick your own rich white tycoons, young or old, dead or live)?  What difference would it have on the black masses?<br />Almost none is the correct, but not the exact answer.  The exact answer is not only would it have little or no no effect on black culture as a whole, but the lives of these men would themselves be unalterably changed.<br />That is the exact answer.<br />The effects of white racism are global, systemic. There is no way to hide from it--no safe haven from it; it cannot be finessed or seduced-either analytically or existentially.  Attempts to do so, just makes the analyst a part of the problem-that is a part of white collective denial about the collection of closed white superiority myths.<br />We cannot solve the problem of black culture without including America's own existential crisis with the issue of race in the analysis.  Race is not an exogenous variable it is an endogenous one--an American problem.  White racism is an American problem that blacks must help solve just as black self-development is a black problem that whites must help solve.  We must stop running from the obvious and began to work within our American family and help our white brothers help themselves and in turn they will help us.  There is no other solution, analytically or existentially.<br />Surely the author does not supposed for a moment that a well-educated, economically vibrant, culturally coherent black race is going to be welcomed with open arms into the larger economically competitive racist American family, does he?  Anyone who thinks that has missed the real lessons of Nazi Germany, Apartheid South Africa and American Southern Reconstruction.  These are the blacks who will be the most threatening to a weak white self-concept.  As in Nazi Germany, the successful ones will be the ones most detested.  We cannot forget, that white fantasy no matter how powerful and dominant is still not reality.<br />Just as there was no \\"Jewish problem\\" in Nazi Germany there is no \\"black problem\\" in America.  There is only a white problem.  Once that problem is solved, we will all be free.<br />The snake in America's bosom-white racism--must be confronted and slain, otherwise nothing that is not blonde and blue-eyed is  safe.  White racism is the gravity that holds a flawed white identity together; it is the glue that holds together a dying and corrupt system; it cannot be appeased by either good or bad black strategies because it remains unaffected by them. It must be confronted, and then confronted some more.  Amen.<br />This book deserves six stars!  It is awesome.	2004-07-06

Resubmitted on 2/5/3<br />Dr. Brodkins' book is a fair synthesis of post -War racial scholarship and theorizing. Her personal approach is entertaining and seductive but far from being a compelling story -even though there are many aspects of the book for one to like.<br />As well, one can hardly disagree with her main theme that racism and racial identity is the single most important basis of a healthy self-concept in the contemporary American way of life.<br /><br />Moreover, one must take careful note of what she has to say about Jewish industriousness as being a critical parameter in the route to group success against all forms of chauvinism--including anti-Semitism, sexism and racism--although it was difficult to avoid the fact that she did jump over rather quickly the issues of race and anti-Semitism to get to her main menu item, gender.<br /><br />All that said however, it was painful watching her finesse the issue of Jewish racism against blacks, both before and after the events directed against European Jews; and both before and after the \\"gender revolution.\\"<br /><br />One reason the war against racism (and sexism) cannot be won in the way the author suggests is that once a group is admitted to the club of \\"being white,\\" or being allowed, in the case of sexism, to use \\"the flawed white male model,\\" it already has learned all too well how to play the role of being superior to those still remaining outside those exclusive clubs. The real problem is that the illicit rewards, both tangible and intangible, in a racist and/or sexist society are so enormous that there is hardly any incentive to do otherwise.<br />That passive-aggressive racism and passive-aggressive sexism are at least as dangerous as their more overt and active counterparts is hardly a secret anymore. Yet, the fact that this book splits hairs between sexism and racism, emphasizing one at the expense of the other, marks its clear position on the racist-sexism evolutionary chart.<br />One must continue to be surprised and disappointed when those who have experienced racism on such a massively inhuman scale, as has been the case with European Jews, Native Americans and American Blacks, nevertheless lend their voices to the same worldview and tactics used to invent ideologies that can lead to such atrocities.<br />The attitude that \\"racism is okay so long as it does not affect me or my group\\" guarantees we will be a long time bringing the practice in America to a final end.<br />Although this is not the book I would have written if I were a Jewish woman, it is nevertheless a worthy and interesting effort.

This emphasis alone is a display of courage unlikely to be found except in very rare instances in other books on this subject.<br />Despite its flair, the book is still dense with details that only a first rate historian could uncover and organize so well.  And although the book has been criticized for being too much of a Marxist economic analysis, it is nevertheless accurate, has the full ring of truth and remains relatively non-polemical.  And for one partial to non-Marxist economic analyses, I find rather strangely that DuBois' Marxist analysis seems the appropriate tool uniquely suited for analyzing the circumstances of this particular era of American history.<br /><br />In short, the book is not just another oblique harangue against the American system of racism as it was practiced during the reconstruction era--or as it has been practiced during any era for that matter.<br />Along side Eric Froner's book, &quot;Reconstruction,&quot; this is another tour de force.  For essential reading on one of the most important periods in American history, one is unlikely to find in print a better book on this subject.  Amen.	2004-01-29

If six stars were allowed I would give it to this book.<br />This romp through history teems with the optimistic sounds, rhythms, smells and tastes of all we have come to understand as the proverbial American \\"melting pot.\\"  It is a profoundly uplifting and optimistic read.  It is an essential side of the untold-American story, but not the only one.  Unfortunately it is as clear to us (the reader)-as it is to Mr. Talty that he has sampled only the best of America-the m&eacute;lange that is, to our collective dismay, but the fringe on top.<br />Thus, it is so very easy to be seduced by this book.  It is so well written.  It reflects so much of the author's passion and love for this country.  It is so intelligently thought-out.  In short, it is wishful thinking at its delicious best.  I love the place in the heart and soul from which this book sprung.  At some point in our lives, most of us share that wonderfully optimistic out look on America.  We want the best for our country and we also want only to think the best about it.  We all yearn for this 400-year old experiment to succeed.<br />So it is easy to be seduced by Mr. Talty's book. Indeed we want to be seduced by it.  And he wants to seduce us.  But if one is not careful, he may be completely taken in by it and begin to think for instance that had Dennis Rodman and Madonna had kids their Mulattos off-springs too would have inherited the earth. We might forget that the hiphoppers are also rebelling against Louis Armstrong's grinning teeth.  We might think that Elvis and Little Richard were some kind of ambassador for race-mixing.  But alas it is not so!  It is all a self-fulfilling mirage.  There is a deeper realty underlying rock-and-roll, Jazz, hip-hop and black ghetto pimps.<br />It is the reality of that side of America born with D.W. Griffith's \\"Birth of a Nation\\"-which the author curiously failed to include in his very selective romp through American history.No one is more aware than the author that his romp--however lyrical and well stated it may be--is but the fringe sitting atop a burgeoning \\"rotten egg.\\" One that seems always just one step away from bursting at the seam.  One that after 400 years still has (\\"soft\\") white superiority--an epithet that remains the unwritten subtext of his book--written all over it.  But the author cannot be blamed for that any more than a fish can be blamed for swimming in polluted waters.<br />Of course, for cosmetic reasons (reasons of collective denial) America's ideology of racism is no longer called that any more.  There are any numbers of other euphemisms, recycled, as times require, that serve that purpose-such as: multiculturalism, color blind society, paper equality, \\"mulatto America,\\" etc., ad infinitum.<br />The one in vogue today is \\"Social Darwinism,\\" a generic name for \\"Republican and Democratic Conservatism.\\" Social Darwinism is a \\"stand in\\" for snow white's famous \\"mirror, mirror on the wall kind of whiteness.\\" The kind that says if America is to remain a white nation (as surely it must, at all cost) it must become a \\"Zero-Sum Society,\\" a \\"Winner-Take-All Society,\\" the \\"Cheating Society,\\" the \\"Cynical Society,\\" and the \\"Unconscious Civilization.\\"<br />If not, the mirror on the wall is likely to answer:  You are still the fairest in the land... but they (those Mulattoes, and reds, and browns, and blacks, and especially those yellows) are gaining on you fast.<br />Why is it that one half of the contribution to our national-race-mixing salsa--that part made by whites themselves--never quites gets discussed openly until its too late?  [Like Strom Thursmond's mulatto daughter? Why leave discussing whiteness to the David Dukes of the world and to the \\"Turner Diaries, etc.?] Why is it that \\"Whiteness\\" is either the only conceptual reality, the only subjectivity, the only worldview or it has to remain a phantom in the background--the invisible substrate, the neutral background that pulls all the strings but cannot be seen except just beyond the shadows?<br />There is another problem with Mr. Talty's book. It is a technical one. Compared to England, or Germany, or almost any other advanced Western society, THERE IS NO \\"Mulatto America.\\"  Fifty per cent of Brits are intermarried with their non-white minorities.  In America, even in 2004, it is still less that 5%.  And although 25% of whites have some black blood and 50% of blacks and Indians with some white blood, it is all as a result of white male-on-black female rape during slavery and the later \\"passing for white\\" that was required by these Mulatto off-springs--not as a result of contemporary race mixing-which incidentally is so minimal compared to other Western nations that it has raised concerns among sociologists.<br />So, where is this mulatto America that Mr. Talty speaks of?<br />While all this is more a critique of the context of the book, than the book itself, it reflects how deeply this book can affect one's thinking, and how much it reflects America's yearning, no matter the color.<br />In sum, this is a heroic effort no matter how the book affects you.  Please buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  I guarantee it.<br />As a parting shot, may I suggest that we need Mr. Talty's mind, passion and superb writing skills-working behind the screen of racism as well as in front of it--if we are to ever prick the poison in the rotten egg that lies beneath. Hopefully his next book will be about what lies beneath the fringe-for that too-perhaps even more profoundly and certainly more frightfully--is also America.<br />When humpty-dumpty is finally toppled from the wall, only then will we be able to sing a new song of America in a truly Mulatto key.und--the invisible substrate, the neutral background that pulls all the strings but cannot be seen except just beyond the shadows?<br />There is another problem with Mr. Talty's book.

Books	3	7	10	N	Y	Too Little and Too Late	An insider's belated account of how the hidden hand of LBJ's Texas functionaries actually worked--behind the shield of the lawyer-client privilege.  The book's validity hangs in large part on the slender thread of a partial fingerprint discovered on the sixth floor of the Texas school book depositary building where there appears to have been convincing proof that the print belongs to Malcolm &quot;Mack&quot; Wallace, a convicted murderer and acknowledged LBJ hit man--rather than to Lee Harvey Oswald.<br />As McClelland tells it, that fingerprint, coupled with a number of other scandals about to converge on the Vice President and end his political career if not land him in jail, gave sufficient impetus to him and his evil home-grown Texas mafia--to commit the murder of the century.<br />Beyond that, the reader is given what the author calls &quot;factions&quot; which is (as I understand it) his fiction elaborated and interpolated between a paucity of facts, innuendoes and insiders bragging about how the assassination of JFK was actually carried out. In other words, &quot;factions&quot; is McClelland's fiction loosely disguised as facts.<br />Except for the fingerprint, impending scandals that would have landed LBJ in jail, and after-the-fact hearsay, the narrative that McClelland unravels is very much like what we have come to expect of the lunatic fringe of the JFK assassination conspiracy crowd.<br />There are differences however that make the book worth reading.  McClelland confirms that a party attended by a host of bigwigs was held on 21 November at oil magnate Clint Murcheson's home. The book also admits that the fatal shot came from the right front by someone he refers to as &quot;Junior.&quot; Any book that does not at least acknowledge that the fatal shot was a front head shot has absolutely no credibility with the majority of Americans.<br />Although McClelland remains mum on who attended the assassination eve party, the Garrison investigation, and on who &quot;Junior&quot; is (was), Barr does indeed seem to know more than he is letting on to.<br />Maybe his next book will be a real mindblower.  Anyway, this book takes a fresh book at the Texas connections, and for that reason alone gets three stars and demands being read.	2004-01-18

A new strain begins in the middle of nowhere and leads further into  nowhere.  Then it switches back to the previous nowhere, etc. etc., ad infinitum.<br /><br />The astute reader cannot be fooled by this lurching nonsense.  That Ms. Lorenz was a fine soldier of fortune -- female style -- and was a CIA/FBI mercenary to boot who somehow managed to survive through some very turbulent times is a detail that no one can deny.  But in the end this is only a detail, not a story.<br /><br />The $64,000 question is: if she did all of the things this book claims she did, how did she manage to do so and still lives to tell about it?<br /><br />Now that is a story worth telling, but this book does not tell us that story. It opts for a B-rated movie excitement version of a few isolated facts strung together instead.<br /><br />She was Castro's lover and managed an assasination try on him; in the cabal with Lee Harvey Oswald, Frank Sturgis, Jack Ruby and E. Howard Hunt that led to JFK's assasination, yet managed to escape complicity in both assasinations, and then  lived to write a book that tells us nothing about any of this?<br /><br />And saddest of all, she does not even give us the benefit of her speculation?<br /><br />Somewhere there is an interesting story to be told about Martita Lorenz's life that will have the ring of truth, but this CIA redacted melodrama, masquerading as a cheap unbelievable love story is not it.<br /><br />Too bad that Marita does not realize that over the years of her experiences and the writing of this book, America has grown up -- even if she hasn't.<br /><br />She continues to live out her life through the 50s and 60s spy games in her head.  That is about all one will get out of this poorly written teenage-level spy novel.<br /><br />In a way this is very, very sad.  There is probably a lot she could have told us about the events of the past that would have made a difference to American and German history.  But, alas she and her co-writer opted instead for an immature potential B-rated movie script instead.<br /><br />Why did they opt to do this?  Did Marita indeed have something to hide?  Does she need money? In the end was she a double/triple agent like her mother was?  Did Castro turn her?  Maybe she was indeed part of a Castro revenge attempt on JFK's life?  Who knows?  This supposedly innocent love story raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />The only fact worth retaining from the book was mentioned as an aside early on (page 5).  It is that Joe Kennedy hated and wanted to get Myer Lansky out of Cuba (if not wanted him killed outright after the Cuban revolution). They were bootlegging competitors. This fact alone lends independent credibility and corroboration to Micheal Collins Piper's Final Judgement theory about Lansky and JFK's assasination (See on AMAZON.COM Michael Collins Piper, Final Judgement).<br /><br />Other than that, this book is an empty shell.  Thank God we readers are no longer stupid enough to go for this kind of pablum.ll one will get out of this poorly written teenage-level spy novel.<br /><br />In a way this is very, very sad.  There is probably a lot she could have told us about the events of the past that would have made a difference to American and German history.  But, alas she and her co-writer opted instead for an immature potential B-rated movie script instead.<br /><br />Why did they opt to do this?  Did Marita indeed have something to hide?  Does she need money? In the end was she a double/triple agent like her mother was?  Did Castro turn her?  Maybe she was indeed part of a Castro revenge attempt on JFK's life?  Who knows?  This supposedly innocent love story raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />The only fact worth retaining from the book was mentioned as an aside early on (page 5).  It is that Joe Kennedy hated and wanted to get Myer Lansky out of Cuba (if not wanted him killed outright after the Cuban revolution). They were bootlegging competitors. This fact alone lends independent credibility and corroboration to Micheal Collins Piper's Final Judgement theory about Lansky and JFK's assasination (See on AMAZON.COM Michael Collins Piper, Final Judgement).<br /><br />Other than that, this book is an empty shell.  Thank God we readers are no longer stupid enough to go for this kind of pablum.	2003-09-08

Although Aronson's volume is far from being preachy, it is difficult not to make certain connections within our own society that have the character of being drawn directly from Aronson's experiments.<br />Racism, for instance can now be explained entirely in social psychological terms. Both white and non-white behaviror--actions and interactions--follow the models of Aronson's experiments precisely. Alienation within our society and the attendant lost of a sense of community is another example of one of the secondary effects of social psychological processes made so profoundly clear from this book.<br />Aronson leaves us with a lot to digest and think about, and this in my view is what books of this sort should do. This is a real tour de force.  I highly recommend it.	2003-08-18

This is an incredible book, but one with a limited focus.  It seeks to better understand how to contain isolated acts of violence associated with hatred, rather than how to deal with the cumulative effects of normalized, sublimated societal hatred-that is hatred permitted and made acceptable by a given culture or society.<br />It seems that the anecdotal evidence from history would overwhelmingly argue that \\"normalized\\" and sublimated cultural and societal hatred in the form of sanctioned \\"bent-up\\" resentment and stored hostility (as in the case of the passive assent of Germans to the mechanized murder of Jews during the holocaust of WW-II, or the centuries of sublimated and stored hatred between opposing factions in Yugoslavia or Rwanda, or even the episodic eruption into violence by blacks in America).<br />While this profoundly serious, well-written and well-researched analysis based both on the best psychological theories and the best results of clinical experience is right on target in the issue it has isolated for analysis-the evil of hatred that spills over into violence--it suffers from what I call \\"the error of the psychologist.\\"  It fails to deal with the issue of how cultures and societies themselves promote collective hatred through its institutions and through conditioning. When hatred that spills over into isolated violence is staked out as being qualitatively different than collective hatred that has been quietly normalized and diffused through the societal mind and through societal structures, it ignores all available evidence that there is such a thing as \\"structural hatred,\\" a kind of societal pre-positioning of hate, or staging area that prepares and directs a culture towards the kind of hate that is permissible.<br />While it is understandable why it is currently fashionable to focus on the \\"Hitlers\\" and \\"bin Ladens\\" of the world, this focusing on the aberrant is itself a form of projection in which ordinary people get to \\"distance\\" themselves from the hatred within themselves by projecting it outward onto the isolated aberrant cases.  In giving us permission to ignore the hatred within us and to hate any deviations from the norm, it is made all the easier to ignore the generalized collective hatred within the society at large--a hatred which condones and conditions us to passivity-the very kind of passivity that allowed Hitler's holocaust machinery to take full reign.<br />This may seem like a fine point-so many angels dancing on the head of a pin-but in an era where symbolic hatred is so much easier to formulate, consolidate and direct than hatred based on \\"real\\" fears, it is not a small matter at all.<br />Yes, we must deal with the killers of James Bird, and the Idi Amins and bin Ladens of the world, but we also must deal with cultures of hatred-including that of our own.  In the U.S., by the definitions the author uses for hate, Americans still have permission to hate blacks-so long as they do not hitch them to a pick up truck and drag them to their death, or call them \\"niggers\\"-at least only do so when paraphrasing Mark Twain's Huck Finn, etc.<br />This restricting one's clinical vision to what is below rather than what is at or above the societal level makes the Psychiatrist's myopic analyses look a great deal more profound and useful than they really are.  We live in a culture where everyone but the Psychiatrists is peering over the head of society looking deep down within its abyss rather than being captivated by what is inside it and looking up.<br />The Psychiatrists had better wake up or they are going to be left holding the bag.  But this criticism aside, this is a great book, much, much better than  Rush Dozier's \\"Why We Hate.\\"	2003-08-15

Using the Old Testament as his anchor, Cahill takes us on a grand seven thousand year romp through history, chronicling as he goes the events that led to Western Consciousness and our current cosmological worldview.  It was the Jews that led us from the world of the wheel-where nothing was ever new and thus where there was no need for a past, present and future, or for individual self-consciousness for that matter--to the open-ended worldview we now share-in which for the first time, \\"time itself\\" was to include a past, present and a future, and novelty and progress became conscious possibilities. It was the Jews that taught us the idea that a god could be centered inside our head as a \\"spirit\\" instead of outside it as a \\"monument.\\"  Without the intervention of the ten nomadic tribes of Israel, we might still be worshiping idols gods and following the \\"ways of the wheel.\\" Again Five Stars for Thomas Cahill.	2003-08-06

His recitation of some of the most recent discoveries in neuro-biology are impressive except they lack a mature psychologist perspective and it avoids the best laboratory of all for demonstrating the truth of his theories: the U.S.  And here I do not mean just the likes of Timothy McVeigh and other U.S. nut cases.<br />Were Mr. Dozier to have used just a little psychological insight, and even a smattering of political science he would have no doubt noticed that U.S. culture is and always has been a fine laboratory specimen of a culture of hate at work and at play everyday.  Here we have as much hate as as any country still in existence.  We have racism against blacks that is still disgraceful.  We have sexism, homophobia, and anti-semitism, yet Mr. Dozier studiously avoided these in favor of discussing Islamic Jihads, Osama bin Laden and such. This approach is likely to sell books, but how intellectually honest an effort is it, really?  We had hate long before Osama and the Jihads, or didn't we?<br />Somehow, Mr. Dozier managed to seek far away examples in the Middle East, and elsewhere rather than right here at home. In skilfully omitting the U.S. among his examples he missed an important opportunity to use his fine research as a vehicle not just to sell books, but also to help heal this nation we all love so dearly.  Nevertheless buy the book it is worth reading.	2003-07-27

This tour de force on Freudian psychological thought extends the bounds beyond anything that Freud, his teacher and mentor could have ever imagined himself.<br />Every sentence is lucid and compelling.<br />This book sparkles and speaks mostly to man's fears and irrationalities.  But it does not try to exorcise or explan them away.  For the first time a theory accepts them both as integral parts of the fabric of the human condition. The treatment of ideologies alone is worth the price of ten books, but there is more, a lot more: on creativity, social organization, human personality, etc. Ten stars!	2003-07-27

Anyone who is up on this literature has to have a good \\"crap detection\\" system, and this selection seems to have passed the test with flying colors. Since the early 70s, all serious roads to discovering who killed JFK seem to be leading back to tying up the loose ends left by the Jim Garrison New Orleans investigation.  And since there were many such loose ends to tie up, doing so is not a small job. Torbitt has hit pay dirt, and at the very least, pushes Garrison's investigation to the next research frontier--if not to the very edge of completely uncovering the assassination plot.  Yet, there are questions this research raises itself.  For instance, I am not yet convinced of the Nazi connections--even though there is much  circumstantial evidence to support Torbitt's point of view. Despite my misgiving, this piece is coherent in the extreme and can stand on its own.  We know that when the conspiracy is finally uncovered, the truth will have its own unmistakable context, and this book has the \\"smell of truth.\\"	2003-02-22

Ms. Smith's honesty and eloquence in telling a profoundly American story about the perfidy of the South of her childhood is a literary tour de force about an immensely important slice of American history.  It is a profoundly American tragedy fashioned from the most basic of human materials, human fallibilities, many of which still consume us as Americans--black or white, north or south.  This book is the most sombering account of who we Americans are--as opposed to who we wished we were--anyone is likely to ever encounter.  Unfortunately, since her death, Ms. Smith's story of about race, sex, religion, politics, economics and deception in the south has become the American way of life, writ large.	2002-12-31
