She decided the best way to accomplish her goals was to pretend to have a serious heart problem.  Whether it was her planning or fate that brought the couples together, well never know.<br /> <br />When Rainas husband died, Chase Chandler became the man of the house, so he gave up all of his dreams to make sure his younger brothers could follow their hearts.  Now that his mother and brothers are happy, he decides that it is finally his turn.  Shortly after making this decision, he meets Sloan and is smitten by her. Since Sloane was on a mission to find out the truth about her father, the last thing she wanted was to fall in love. The path to happiness isnt always where we think it should be.  Chase certainly didnt want to give up his freedom and Sloane didn't want a man running away from the thoughts of a family......... but did I mention the smitten part?   <br /> <br />This is my favorite book in the Chandler series.  It wasnt as funny as the first two books, but it was a lot more suspenseful.  Carly Phillips was able to blend humor, suspense, romance and enough steam to fog up the windows.	2003-08-27

Not only does she bring people to life, but also she somehow captures the essence of New Orleans.  It is as if the city is a character in the book. Several storylines weave in and out as the tale unfolds, and Smith was able to tie them all together to create a terrific mystery novel.<br /> <br />Some bad guys are more difficult to capture than others. Former evangelical preacher, Errol Jacomine, is back with a new face, voice and style, but underneath the pretty new façade the old evils lurks.  Skip is determined to bring this man to justice, and Jacomine is determined to kill his enemy any way he can.  The secondary story about the theft of cemetery art added to the overall appeal of the novel and made me long to visit New Orleans again.	2003-08-17

Wiltse just writes one terrific book after another and this is certainly no exception.  I was able to see life through Billy Tree's eyes again, and I've missed the view since reading Heartland.  In The Hangman's Knot we learn a great deal about how Billy's personality  was created with flashbacks into his childhood.  I found these glimpses revealed many clues as to how he thinks and made me adore the character even more.<br />Billy receives a hangman's knot and the adventure begins.  It all seems to go back to a lynching held in a nearby town many years ago.  The writer's portrayal of current and past bigotry in a small town was told easily as he held the suspense level to a maximum.  The story could stand alone, but when you add the beautiful prose and great characterizations, you change what could be a good book to a great one.  <br />If you enjoy terrific writing and a wonderful story, I highly recommend you read The Hangman's Knot. If you've not read Heartland, I urge you to read it as well.	2002-07-29

I fell in love with Josh and Biff, and I feel sure I would have NEVER missed Sunday School if I could have learned about Jesus as a child and young man. ;)<br />The writing and humor are absolutely wonderful, but what made this book stand out to me was the darling characters and the life lessons they learned. <br />If you need a book to give you laughter, food for thought, and hours of entertainment, buy this book.  I loved every word in The Lamb. The only bad thing about the book was it couldn't go on forever.	2002-07-29

I expect a great book when I see Katy Munger is the author, but I'm always surprised at just how good the books are.  The Casey Jones series is a first-day-rush-to-the-book-store and grab the next book in the series for an evening's entertainment, and you might as well block off the entire evening, because you won't be able to put this puppy down. :)  I thought Legwork was fantastic, but each book in this series is better than the last.  Better Off Dead is a carefully plotted, thrilling mystery populated by colorful characters, and the star, Casey Jones, is my idol.  The only bad thing about Better Off Dead was I finished it so quickly; however, I do plan on making up for that by reading it again soon.<br />If you enjoy great writing, a suspenseful plot and several good laughs per book, then this book is for you.	2001-08-08

Partners by Susan Sizemore is the second in the Laws of Blood series. I read and enjoyed the first book in the series, but Partners is a much better book than the first, The Hunt.  You don't have to read the The Hunt to enjoy this book, but it does give a lot of background on the Stigoi community.<br /><br /><br />Partners deals with a young enforcer coming to terms with her new powers and a vampire killer with a criminal past coming to terms with his thoughts on 'monsters'.  The Hunt is suspenseful, violent, sexy and often funny.  If you are a fan of the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton, I think you'll LOVE this book. :)	2001-05-21

I really didn't think Montanari would ever top the wonderful &quot;Deviant Way&quot;, but he sure did with Kiss of Evil.  The writing was to-die-for, the pace relentless, and the character came to life and told their story.  If you like your thrillers on the dark side, you'll fall in love with Kiss of Evil.	2001-05-15

I must admit at first I was let down that this wasn't a John Becker book.  That disappointment lasted about five breathtaking pages before I was quickly sucked into the story of Billy Tree, and I found him to be as compelling, if not more so, than John Becker.  Both Billy Tree and John Becker are complex characters, but that is where the similarity ends.  Billy is still grounded by his family, particularly his sister.  He even takes on the brogue of his Irish ancestors as he takes over the book and the reader's imagination.<br />After being wounded in a shootout, Billy returns to his home in the heartland of America.  His memories of small town USA are slowly replaced by those of a town that is not isolated from the woes of the big city.  Before he has time to lick his wounds, he is helping the man he most admired, the town sheriff, solve a murder.<br />I've learned to expect excellence in books by David Wiltse and consider Heartland to be his best book.  The plotting is superb, the characters well drawn and intriguing, and his depiction of the heartland is unblinkingly honest.  I absolutely could not put this book down, and I did something I seldom do.  I read it again immediately cover to cover.  If you are looking for a book with intense and exciting action filled characters you can't seem to leave, I recommend you read Heartland immediately.  It is the best book I've read this year, and I sincerely doubt anything will be able to top it.  I'm on tenterhooks awaiting information on the next book by Wiltse.	2001-02-20

Risen did just that. I tossed and turned as all the  events replayed themselves in my head and every shadow in the room looked  menacing. Reading Risen was like watching a horror movie when I was a  child. I wanted to find a way to read it between my fingers while clutching  a blanket to throw over my head during the scary parts. Unfortunately, that  is impossible to do while reading, so I kept reading, as the hair on the  back of neck stood straight up.      Risen is set in a small town called  Anderson, but it could be small town Anywhere. This sleepy town was filled  with interesting characters, bored teen-agers, and something very, very  frightening. Without giving any of the story away, you truly don't know if  you can trust anyone. The pace is suspenseful and relentless. The mystery  of what is happening unfolds meticulously, and the end left me gasping for  air.     If you devour good horror, then this book will grab you on page  one and not let you go until the final chapter. No, it won't let you go  even then, because I'm still thinking about it. I highly recommend Risen.	2000-08-10

I can do without sleep  when a book is this good! <br /> The plot, characters......Heck the entire  book was just perfect.  I wouldn't change a word.  Casey Jones kicks some  major butt in this one. :)  I was so pleased to get a glimpse into Casey's  past life, and I really liked the way she handled it.

I keep saying with each installment in the Bolitar series by Harlan Coben that they just can't get better, and Coben makes a liar out of me every time. <br /> Darkest Fear was everything a great mystery/thriller should be -  terrific characters, fast moving plot and great dialogue, but it was more  than that.  Darkest Fear had me ready to cry on one page and laughing my  head off on the next.  It was an emotional roller coaster, and I absolutely  couldn't put the book down.  From the beginning scene with his parents to  the final scene in the book, I was caught in Coben's web.  <br /> I feel I can  safely say that the series can't get any better than this.......

Meg, an ex-cop, runs  a security business with her friend, Mike, and is drawn into intrigue when  she is unable to find him.  The book was filled with twists and turns,  delightful characters, suspense, sexual tension, excitement and some  delicious surprises.

I started reading the series because Multiple Listings concerned Realtors.  I thought she nailed us. :)  My interest in her character has grown with each  book.  Cuttings concerns the floral industry (which I found to be  surprisingly fascinating), and I was grabbed from the first page.  The plot  had a very unexpected turn, at least for me, and I loved it.  It was one of  those slap your forehead and say DUH times.  The clues were there, but  Grant had me so caught up in the story I missed them.  It is a wonderful  mystery that gives us a glimpse into the new urban south of Charlotte.  I  love Sydney and highly recommend this book and the first two Multiple  Listing and Smoke Screen.  You might as well buy them all while you are  here, because you'll come back for them.  Cuttings is a must read for  mystery lovers.	1999-08-11

The mystery begins when the police find a body in the destroyed  gallery. The story twists and turns, and she had me totally baffled as to  who and why. The writing is delicious, and I highly recommend this book  (which I thought was even better than Bluejay Shaman).	1999-04-17

The characters were great, especially Steve. If you can suspend disbelief and want to escape the real world, then you must read this book. Steve isn't quite my image of Puff the Magic  Dragon. He is a bit too earthy for that, but he is a charmer. I smiled and  giggled throughout the entire novel and still was worried and fretful that  everything would turn out okay for the zany cast of characters. Christopher  Moore has done it again. His story captured my imagination and gave me an  afternoon of laughter. The only bad part -- now it is back to the real  world and a long wait for the next book by this talented man.	1999-03-28

This is the last in the series for now, and it was with regret that I read the last page.  I highly recommend this entertaining PI novel, but I suggest you read them in order,  if possible.  Milan goes through some rough times and changes, but he keeps  getting better.  The one constant is the wonderful city of Cleveland in the  backdrop.  Great book and terrific series.	1998-11-21

I enjoyed it more than any of his other books, and  I'm a huge Patterson fan.  If you can't suspend disbelief, this book isn't  for you; however, if you can let your imagination soar, you will fall in  love with this novel.  I loved the story, the suspense and the characters.   This is a keeper, because I'll reread it many times.<br />....Erma	1998-10-08

If you are in the mood for a great mystery with terrific characters, then buy Legwork today.  This might be the first Casey Jones mystery you buy, but it won't be the last.  I e-mailed the author begging for another as soon as I finished Legwork.  Casey Jones is a smart-mouthed almost private eye with a rocky past, and one of the best new characters I've read in years.  While you are here, go ahead and order Out of Time, because you'll be back!	1998-08-04

This is the first book by Sparkle Hayter (love the name) that I have laughed my way through, but it will not be the last.   <br />  Robin is the perfect woman of the 90's.  She faces her problems with her new positive attitude and her weapons of choice - an epilady and poison ivy.  The mystery is interesting, the humor superb and Sparkle a keeper. <br /> Erma Arthur, Reading Forum Assistant, MSN	1997-09-24

Alex Cooper is back and better than ever.  You travel with her on her journey in finding the killer of talented physician.  The suspense starts with the first call to come to the doctor's office and investigate the crime scene and follows thoughout the twists and turns of this wonderful book.  Mike Chapman is back and the sexual tension with him and Alex is still under the surface.  After reading this book, I'll be very careful before I check into a hospital.  The only thing bad  is that it will have you begging for another episode in the life of Cooper.  If you enjoy a good thriller, then grab this book and enjoy	1997-08-21

Alex Cooper is one of the most interesting characters I've read in a very long time.  Her relationship with Mike Chapman has the possibility of being one of the most exiting I've read.  Fairstein made me feel like I was in the middle of the DA's office participating in this investigation.  I am thrilled that this is the first of many books with Alex Cooper leading the way.

US	52957618	R3ALA8PD1G6E5W	0399142088	74229807	Blown Away	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Becker is the Best	Just when I thought David Wiltse could not write a better book, I got &quot;Blown Away&quot;.  You have all of the edge of the first Becker books with the added humor of bit players. He has you chewing your nails one moment and laughing out loud in the next.  Wiltse has perfected the serial killer books and John Becker is the most intriguing characther I've read.  With his wife slowly recovering from injuries and coming upon an unknown 'type' of killer, Becker could not rely on the instincts that has guided him in the past books.  I cannot recommend David Wiltse enough.  He is the best kept secret in fiction. If you haven't tried any of his books, take some time off work and read all of the Becker series.

It is a medical thriller, a suspenseful vampire horror story and a heartwarming story of a dysfunctional family.  The relationships, the centuries of anger and pain, the love that will not die, make this one of the best books I've read in any genre. Spruill gives the reader an emotional ride that they will not soon forget.  If you love a great medical thrillers, great vampire books and great stories of undying love, you have found the perfect book.           Erma Arthur, Reading Forum Assistant, MS	1997-08-17

But as you peel back the layers upon layers, you find deeper meaning.  The Trickster is alive and well and easily recognized in many people we know and Mr. Moore made this harsh reality visible and funny.  How can you not love a book with magic, faith restored, life renewed, true love conquering all, and a coyote humping a white leather sofa. &lt;G&gt;  It has it all!  The storytelling is done by the master and the humor is unrelenting as the trickster weaves his tale.  A must read book!  I really did laugh out loud through most of it and cried at least once.  I just can't say enough about this book.  Except, if you read it, you will thank me!  I loved every carefully chosen word.    Erma Arthur, Reading Forum Assistant, MS	1997-08-17

Becker is at his best when confronted with a 'rival' and jealousy puts an even sharper edge on his actions.  Fighting a serial killer on his home turf and with Karen in possible danger makes Becker an even greater threat and more exciting character (if possible).  You can feel his tension mounting throughout the book as he deals with his friend Tee, Karen, a group of misfits, and his growing anger.  An excellent book!

From bowling with turkeys to shoe eating turtles, this books is one laugh after another. Reading about Tommy trying to teach &quot;Lestat&quot; vampire rules to Jody was hysterical.  Christopher Moore takes you from suspense to hilarity in a heartbeat.  Jody and Tommy are beyond interesting and their love story is as sweet as it is funny.  How do you describe a book that rushes from humor to suspense to romance?   Perfect comes to mind!    Erma Arthur, Reading Forum Assistant, MS	1997-08-11

For all of us believing Moore couldn't possilbly get better, &quot;Island of the Sequined Love Nun&quot; taught a valuable lesson.  He did get better.  This book is impossible to put down from the first page and it is laugh out loud funny. Tucker Case, his friends and foes are the most entertaining characters I've encountered.  From Tuck's injury trying to assist a hooker in her quest to join the mile high club, to a transvestite navigator with a talking fruit bat, this book keeps you laughing.  Chris Moore didn't waste a word on this wonderfully written book. Even without the humor, the story would have kept my fingers rapidly turning the pages. Surely, this gem deserves more than a perfect 10.  &quot;Island of the Sequined Love Nun&quot; is a treasure!  Erma Arthu	1997-07-10
