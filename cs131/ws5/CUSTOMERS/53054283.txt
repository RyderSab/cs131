Lewis has written a novel that convincingly talks about the Real Deal: what liberties Americans have lost and how they might get them back.<br /><br />You might expect lengthy John Galt-like political speeches in a novel like this. There aren't any. You might expect black-and-white good guys and bad guys. Well, there's no question who we're meant to root for in this book, but solutions aren't presented as simple, and Lewis' characters are driven as much by messy circumstances as they are by ideology. The novel's scenario is absolutely credible, its characters are well-drawn, and the suspense is nail-biting.	2005-08-27

What if, while fleeing Europe and her arms manufacturer husband Fritz Mandl on her way to Hollywood, actress Hedy Lamarr had met, inspired, and become the lover of von Braun? What if, instead of being crushed between the Republicans (Communists) and Nationalists (fascists) during the Spanish Civil War, disparate anarchist factions had successfully linked arms and won out (with the help of von Braun's rockets)?<br /><br />Those are a few what if's addressed by ANARQUIA, a sci-fi alternate history of the Spanish Civil War by Brad Linaweaver and J. Kent Hastings. I've had a copy of this novel for a few months, and I'm not sure why it took me so long to get to it. I'm glad I finally did, because I had a blast reading it. Ever since I first read Ray Bradbury's \\"A Sound of Thunder\\" in the seventh grade, I've been fascinated by the idea that if you tweak this or that in a timeline, new paths emerge and things down the pike necessarily change. L. Neil Smith has written some wonderful spins on history (his PROBABILITY BROACH, of course, is a libertarian classic). And Harry Turtledove's made an industry of the alternate history genre.<br /><br />But ANARQUIA is special in that it covers ground I can't recall seeing covered before. There have been dozens of speculative novels about \\"what if Hitler had won WWII?\\" New takes on the U.S. Civil War are pretty common. But the Spanish Civil War is fresh territory, and Linaweaver and Hastings don't waste it. They've stuffed every conceivable \\"what if\\" into Anarch&iacute;a, as well as every possible true-life figure you can imagine: Eric Blair (aka George Orwell), Ernest Hemingway, Joseph Stalin, Adolph Hitler, Francisco Franco, Louis B. Mayer, G.K. Chesterton, Ayn Rand (and her husband Frank O'Connor, who has an affair with Hedy Lamarr in the book), Konrad Zuse, John Dos Passos, and scores of others. And almost every political stripe is represented: Fascists, Falangists, Carlists, Marxists, Trotskyites, Separatists, Loyalists, Royalists, International Brigades, Comintern members, Syndicalists, Distributists...<br /><br />Some readers will be annoyed that the dialogue in ANARQUIA often consists of speeches. But that's customary in most philosophical novels (think Rand).<br /><br />This novel's a must for both history buffs and political junkies.Passos, and scores of others.

They're talking to kids. And what they're talking about is freedom, determination, and self-reliance.<br /><br />OUT OF THE GRAY ZONE is the first in a projected series of \\"young adult\\" novels, a category of fiction dominated until now by adolescent warlocks, happy dragons, and high school girls angst-ridden over their latest crush. You won't find any of that in this initial \\"RebelFire\\" book. This is the story of teenaged Jeremy, whose rock 'n roll inspired dreams are being quashed by CentGov-sanctioned  spycams, sensors, monitors, permits, and doses of dope - \\"all for his own good.\\" In the Gray Zone of America's Pacific Northwest, even his favorite rock band, RebelFire, has been silenced and replaced by \\"a cheerful bleat of very bad march music\\" on the satellite link. Jeremy's always lived under the control of CentGov and its Departments of Firearms Elimination, Drug Enforcement, Homeland Serenity, ad nauseum, but he's become increasingly dissatisfied. And now that they've taken RebelFire away...<br /><br />Jeremy's adventures are exciting, sometimes shocking, often violent. The characters he meets will stir you. And if you don't fall in love with Hero, the furry mutt who joins Jeremy along the way, you've got a heart made of steel wool. Shame on you.<br /><br />This new RebelFire series is just what the Freedom Movement ordered. I can't recall a libertarian novel as truly perfect for teenagers (yet entertaining for adults) since J. Neil Schulman's ALONGSIDE NIGHT, and that was 25 years ago. If you have a kid, or even know a kid, who enjoys reading, drop OUT OF THE GRAY ZONE into their hands. It's a terrific tale of despair, perseverance and, ultimately, hope. It may turn their heads around. And you'll like it, too.<br /><br />(Final note: The book comes with a nifty CD that contains two distinct versions of the RebelFire anthem \\"Justice Day.\\" The first, by Rockne Van Meter, is classic rock and very good. The other, by Opium War, is labeled \\"heavy metal\\" but reminds me of X, the greatest punk band I ever heard or saw in the early '80s.

Now, however, Leslie Klinger has produced a NEW Annotated for THIS generation, and it's really quite wonderful. These are the first two volumes (the complete Doyle short stories) of what will be a three-volume masterwork (the third volume will hold the four novels). They come beautifully slipcased. The reproductions of the old illustrations are crisper and sharper than I've ever seen them.

I read FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS when it first appeared in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine more than 30 years ago. I was an impressionable high school senior, and it shook me to my core. I've probably bought new copies of this book a dozen times, reread it twice as many times, and I still think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing EVER. But here's the thing: it reads like a madcap, drug-induced, stream-of-consciousness diary, but Thompson spent MONTHS writing it in a hotel room in Arcadia, California...writing, rewriting, editing, polishing, paring it down, adding passages. This wonderful, hilarious/dead-serious romp may read like the spontaneous ravings of a madman, but it's the well-crafted work of a great writer who knows his stuff.

I first read Baring-Gould's biography back in 1975, and it was my first REAL exposure to The Game -- the treatment of Sherlock Holmes as a living person and the art of speculating about The Master's life from the clues dropped by Watson in the original stories. I'm delighted that this book is still available.<br />Baring-Gould presents as good a chronology of the Doyle tales as anyone, and he &quot;fills in the blanks&quot; delightfully. (Imagine Holmes fighting a prehistoric bird in hand-to-talon combat on the deck of a freighter! It's true!!)<br />Baring-Gould obviously had a damn good time writing this extraordinary, and definitive, biography of Sherlock.

(As a charter subscriber to that  now-defunct journal, I might have included a few extra articles in this  book, but then)<br />At the time these articles were written, Rothbard had  joined forces with a resurging populist paleo-right in his fight against  the State, against war, and for free markets.(In decades past, he had built  alliances with Stevenson Democrats, New Leftists, and the Libertarian  Party, without ever changing his core political beliefs.) So the book is  filled with attacks on Bush's war on Iraq, big-government  &quot;libertarians,&quot; Clintonian liberalism, and Newt Gingrich's  still-born &quot;Republican Revolution,&quot; all in Rothbard's  curmudgeonly style.

This book is about Murray Rothbard the Political Strategist and  Polemicist. And that makes me happy, because it is *this* Rothbard that I  personally recall so fondly from the old libertarian/anarchist trenches in  the late '60s, early '70s, then again in the early '90s (when Rothbard and  I last met).<br />Raimondo was there in those years 1978-1989 when I wasn't,  when I largely fell away from the libertarian movement, and I enjoyed his  coverage of those years in this book.<br />My only real gripe is that Justin  sometimes lets his biases unfairly color his book, especially about periods  where he wasn't personally present. One example is his &quot;take&quot; on  Rothbard's alliance with Karl Hess in the late '60s. Hess was not quite so  wooly or nutty as Raimondo paints him; you need only read Hess's writings  in Rothbard's own &quot;Libertarian Forum&quot; newsletter from those days  to see that Hess was a thoughtful Rothbardian anarchist during that  period.<br />Anyway, thumbs up for Raimondo's biography of the heroic Murray  Rothbard.

I've been a big fan of Og Mandino for more than a decade, and have read *everything* he wrote. Unfortunately, this book--his last before his death in Fall 1996--isn't quite up to snuff. A second sequel to his terrific GREATEST MIRACLE IN THE WORLD, this book's first half is really a story recap of MIRACLE and the first sequel, RETURN OF THE RAGPICKER. This material is then followed by the book's most valuable offering--reprints of some hard-to-find success literature, much of it more than a century old. But even then, a part of that is wasted on a reprinting of portions from James Allen's classic AS A MAN THINKETH, which you can find just about anywhere. Ah well... Mediocre Og is better than no Og at all, I suppose. It is sad that this book is his last hurrah--and a half-hearted one	1997-06-27

Its History, Culture, and Politics	Books	5	25	27	N	N	How to build a Left-Right coalition	This terrific study of American &quot;isolationism&quot; (i.e., non-interventionism) may be one of the most important political manuals of the last several years. And it may be the first why-to/how-to guide for building a viable Left-Right political coalition. You see, as Kauffman explains it, an America First, mind-your-own-business foreign policy is one area where the far Left and the far Right have often agreed. Therefore, although you might expect this volume to be filled with profiles of Pat Buchanan and other right-wingers, it's not; rather, it examines the ideas of such notable America Firsters as Jack Kerouac, Gore Vidal, and Edward Abbey--all of them Men of the Left. The New Left of the 1960s and much of today's non-interventionist, anti-state Hard Right have a lot in common, Kauffman says. Perhaps it's time the two extremes joined hands in defiance of America's Military Industrial Complex	1997-06-12

Abbey's best work will always be his essays, but this novel is one of those &quot;forgotten&quot; dystopian classics that deserves much more attention. Forget Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; It's too European. Forget Levin's &quot;This Perfect Day.&quot; It's too fantastic. Abbey has written the best post-apocalypse American novel to date. And his politics, as always, ring true. Up the rebels! An anarcho-classic	1997-06-12

Marketing guru Dan Kennedy has filled this book with most of the business and marketing expertise people are spending thousands of dollars at his seminars to hear. Which makes this volume the best business value ever! This book is soooooo good and filled with valuable ideas that you have to take a breather every few pages just to digest it all--the ideas come at you so fast. If you don't think you can still make good money in your own business, starting with little or no capital, Kennedy will change your mind right away. Highly recommended	1997-06-12
