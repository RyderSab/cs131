It was one of those books that is so thoroughly engaging, that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it.  I thoroughly enjoyed being transported into the world of NY auction houses, Russian emigrees, and the new Russia. In a way, it reminded me of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", in that Nicholson combines art and mystery in such an enjoyable way. His insider knowledge makes it all the more enjoyable.  I hope this will not be the last we hear of Mr. Nicholson.	2004-10-28

One of the Mouse children befriends the daughter of the Muslim family... and through her, learns about Ramadan and Eid.  It's very well written, and the illustrations, although few, are nice.  My husband and I enjoyed it as much as our son did. Insha'Allah, it will become a family tradition to read this book every year.  My only wish was that the book was on a bit sturdier cardstock...but that's because my son is young. :)	2004-10-11

As a Muslim, I really don't need to hear anymore of that.  I finally did order it, and was surprised that it is truly a book for Muslims.  To be frank, I don't know if non-Muslims would enjoy it--or even understand it.  Given that, her choice of titles is unfortunate--because she is alienating the audience she wished to engage.  Also, sadly, too many Muslims will discard her points simply because she is a woman, non-Arabic speaking, or gay (or any combination of the three.)  Manji raises some interesting and valid points--such as the treatment of Shi'as and women in 'Muslim' countries.  Her point on why no other country except Jordan grants citizenship to Palestinians is also well taken.  She loses me a bit on her other arguments, but they were nonetheless interesting to read.  I wish her book would be taken up by halaqas (study circles) around the country, but I doubt that's the case.  Instead, it will mostly be used by people who already have a prejudice against Islam to add ammunition to their hate.  Sad.	2004-05-07

This is such an important book for so many reasons.  It is an extremely well written, enjoyable journey into one woman's lifelong struggle with weight and her journey past the weight into a &quot;normal&quot; life.  I appreciated her honesty regarding the struggles after weight loss as much as her honesty during weight loss.  I'd recommend this not only to people who are embarking on, or who have completed, their weight loss journey... but to the friends, parents, physicians, and coworkers of fat people.  <br />Showing myself to be the lifelong dieter that I am... am I the only one who scoured the pages looking for &quot;the magic bullet&quot;? LOL.  I have an idea to the diet having been to OA a few times in the past... but I know that it takes a lot more than a diet to overcome food addiction.<br />Buy this book! It's one of those wonderfully well written books that are such a treat to read, yet end all to soon.	2004-01-30

It speaks to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike and is a truly easy read.  It makes one re-examine one's life and one's religion.  I would recommend it to both non-Muslims who may be interested in Islam, Muslims strong in their deen, and Muslims who may have gotten a bit slack with their Islam.  Each will find a character they can relate to.  The book reminded me of some of the Christian fiction that does such a good job at both telling a story and sharing faith.  There needs to be more books like this by Muslim authors.	2004-01-21

I'd recommend this book for all--both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.  I think pretty much anybody will learn something from going through it.

Reading Ina May's book, and the birth stories of the women in it, has changed all of that.  I feel that I can handle labor now...and am even toying with the idea of not using drugs. (Prior to this, I used to say that I'd like an epidural plus any other drug they'd give me.)  Even if I end up using some pain meds, I know I'll be entering the labor process without the level of fear I had before.  That is priceless.  This is a must-read for any pregnant woman and her husband...whether or not she wants to have a medicated or non-medicated birth.  Bravo Ina May!

This is a program truly for beginners to exercise...absolute beginners.  I like that Bob does not focus on changing one's diet until you establish exercise as a routine; however, I do not agree with him on holding off strength training until the very end.  Muscle burns fat--and can be just as, or even more effective than aerobics alone.  Still, if you're new to exercise...this book will walk you through a gentle program which should have you exercising regularly in a few months.

It's rare to find such an entertaining, witty, likeable and beautiful woman on TV.  My favorite bit is that the show ends by Nigella raiding the 'fridge.  Reading her book is a bit like watching her show--like having a very cool friend come over and teach you how to whip up some good food.  Nigella talks about how she encourages her kids to eat healthful, her diet, and her food philosophy--which seems to be a combination of quality (organic) mixed with pleasure.  Her recipes are easy to make, and the results are wonderful.  I've yet to come across a bad one.  Nigella just may surpass Martha some day--as she's refreshingly real.	2002-01-26

As somebody who has been actively researching WLS for over 2 years, I can honestly say that she doesn't leave out a thing.  She talks about the genetic and scientific reasons behind morbid obesity; goes into depth about the 3 major surgery types (MGB, RNY, and DS); choosing a surgeon; dealing with insurance (her advice on documentation is probably worth the cost of the book); financing the surgery; and life pre- and post-op.  I think that my favorite part of Michelle's book is where she addresses the Fantasies people have about life after WLS--I'll no longer be single, my marriage will improve, etc.  If you are seriously considering surgery for clinically severe obesity (100+ pounds over recommended weight or BMI 40+), then you should buy this book.  Research the surgery thoroughly--through this book, the web, your doctor, and talking to patients who've had WLS (both with positive and negative outcomes).  On a negative side, I think there could have been more information on plastic surgery following WLS--everyone without exception who I've spoken to who has had WLS has needed significant plastic surgery due to excess skin.  One friend says that even though she looks great in clothes, she would never consider wearing a bathing suit due to this problem.  Two books I would recommend to those considering or going through WLS are &quot;The Spark&quot; by Glen Gaesser and &quot;Fat?So!&quot; by Marilyn Wann.  Glenn's book will teach you how to fit 15 10-minute exercise sessions into your life per week.  A very doable program, but with excellent results.  Whether or not you have this surgery, you need to be active in order to prevent disease.  Exercise will only make your WL easier, as well.  Marilynn's book deals with fat empowerment/acceptance.  It's going to take you at least a year to lose a significant amount of weight--why not learn to love yourself now?  If you can do that, there's a greater chance that you will honor your body with appropriate decisions throughout your WLS experience--even if that includes not having surgery at this time.	2001-03-21

Just reading the stories reaffirmed my faith in G-d, in prayer, in life.  Quite frankly, I frequently found myself in tears when reading the stories--what kind of tears? I'm not sure... sort of the tears that makes one happy to know that G-d exists still.  Rebbetzin Jungreis writes in a gifted manner. As a non-Jew (but Monotheist), I was amazed at the wealth of wisdom that can be found in the Torah.  Raised as a Christian, it was commonplace to perhaps read through Genesis and Exodus and then skip on over to the New Testament.  What a mistake.  For me, this book helped me in many ways... it made me even more committed to the act of charity... it made me more committed to exploring the Jewish roots of the monotheistic faiths.  I think this would make an excellent book for teachers to use in helping to make their students more aware of Judaism... to give their students a healthier respect for Judaism.  I also think it would be a good book for families to read together and then discuss.<br />I highly encourage you to buy this book.  It's a treasure that has the potential to change your life and your faith.	2000-12-28

I'm one of those people who buy cookbooks, but rarely get to the making the recipes stage.  This is one of the few cookbooks I own, that I actually *use*.  Why?  Everything that I've made has been easy (no funky ingredients, no bizarre food appliances required), quick, and tasty.  Although everything is vegetarian and low-fat--the food just tastes good.  You don't feel like you're eating healthfully, you just acknowledge the goodness of the food (if that makes sense).  Two of my favorite recipes are the pasta w/tomatoes and chickpeas (sounds bizarre, but very good) and the low-fat chocolate pudding.  As somebody who has always bought Jell-O instant pudding, it was a revelation to realize I could make homemade low-fat chocolate pudding that was just as easy as opening up a box of Jell-O and 10x better in taste!	2000-12-24

I picked up this book during Chanukah this year, because I wanted to brush up on what actually Chanukah was.  Yeah, I know the dreidel song... but that's about it.  As a non-Jew who classifies herself as a monotheist, I've recently been studying Islam for the past five or so years.  Now, I'm exploring the father of Islam (and Christianity), Judaism.  It amazes me to see the similarities--although as Islam comes from Judaism, perhaps I shouldn't be so surprised.  Anyway, I loved this book.  Rabbi Blech's style is extremely easy to read... I actually read through the book in one sitting.  Each little bit made me hungry for more, and the next thing I knew it was 3:30 a.m. and I was finishing the book.  I would recommend this book to people of all faiths... Jews, who need to brush up their own knowledge of their faith; Christians, who perhaps want to understand more about Christianity's roots as well as what Jesus believed; and Muslims, who may benefit from realizing the similarities in the people who worship the same God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  In studying this book, I became convinced that Islam and Judaism are much more similar than is Christianity--but that's just my own opinion.  Well, I'm off to buy more of Rabbi Blech's books.  Buy this book, you'll enjoy it... I promise.	2000-12-24

Why? Because Evelyn teaches you how to sneak &quot;good food&quot; (veggies, fiber, even soy) into &quot;normal food&quot;. Yeah, we all know we should eat cruciforous veggies, more fiber, some soy, fruits, etc.  But we don't.  Evelyn shows you ways to pump up the nutritional value of foods you like--in a way that you won't even notice.  Adding black beans to brownies is one solution--and it works (adds fiber, phytochemicals) and the brownies taste good, not healthy.  She teaches you to puree cauliflower into your potatoes, so that you get the boost of nutrition.  (I HATE cauliflower, but I don't mind eating it this way).  All in all, I can't wait for more Stealth Health recipes.  If you have kids, doubting husbands, or just plain don't like the taste of healthy food, buy this book. :)  If you do like healthy food, this book will amaze you with how good healthy eating can taste.	2000-12-24

It does a great job of  encouraging people of all sizes to make little changes in their lives that  will lead to improved health, not necessarily weight loss (although that  could happen as well).  What I really liked about this book was that their  beginning program was designed for true beginners!  Most beginning exercise  programs start with 30 minutes 3-4 times/week.  The goal of this book is to  get you into the habit of exercising, not tire you out at the beginning.   It starts you with 3 10-minute sessions for the first two weeks.  You can  do that!  You gradually build to doing 3 30-minute sessions over 13 weeks.   The book doesn't leave you there, either... it offers a phase 2  intermediate program and then a choice of 2 phase 3 maintenance programs.   One which is more challenging than the other.  The book is filled with  profiles of large active fit people--regular people and celebrities--which  are truly encouraging.  There are aerobics instructors who weigh more than  200 pounds, people over 300 pounds as well.  People of every size proving  that you can be large and fit and healthy.  The book also covers healthy  eating, emotional eating, and other topics.  One thing I really liked about  this book is that they also talked about other topics related to health,  such as wearing seat belts, going to the doctor for a Pap smear, and  quiting smoking.  All in all, a motivating empowering book!  Also check out  Glenn Gaesser's &quot;Big Fat Lies&quot; and Marilyn Wann's  &quot;Fat!So?&quot;.	2000-09-01

Julia does offer a lot of advice on how supplements can help with certain problems... like sugar  cravings, PMS, thyroid, etc.  Ordering the supplements was rather expensive  (200 dollars), but you need most of them very short term... and I can't  believe how different I feel.  For those of you who either can't afford the  supplements or don't want to take them, buy this book anyway.  Her approach  to eating is so sound, that I'm sure that will do a lot in helping you to  feel better.  General advice... lots of fruits, veggies, low-fat protein,  smaller portions of starchy carbs/grains, nuts, and oils.  Probably eating  more calories than you're used to.... yet you feel so healthy and you still  lose weight.  I also recommend Nikki and David Goldbeck's book, &quot;The  Healthiest Diet in the World&quot;.	1999-06-27

His program is sensible and liveable.  Heck, the guy allows you to have a cheat meal once a week.  If you thought about buying the North American Slimdown, and didn't... buy  this book.  You might want to check out eBay or Amazon's auctions to see if  you can get the program... because the journal was fabulous.  If you're  short on cash, consider buying &quot;Living Lean&quot;... as it is already  in paperback.  Whatever you do, give it a try.  You'll end up healthier,  leaner, and fitter.	1999-05-17

Reading Gwen's book, I still have some of the same issues with her program and writings--i.e. her position on anti-depressants, some of her scripture references being out of context, the potential for encouraging eating disorders among those who are susceptible.  What I do enjoy about the program is the focus on God and on your true hunger.  Many programs have talked about conscious eating (being aware of your hunger and the reasons why you eat when you aren't actually hungry), but Gwen reminds people of the solution to this problem.  Go to God and ask Him for His help.  Regardless of whether or not you are trying to lose weight, focusing on God and asking for His help in all you do is great advice.  Journaling your feelings and prayers (as done in  the workbooks) is also very helpful.  If Gwen's program isn't for you, use what you can, and pray for God's help in finding one that is.  I know a &quot;mixed-program&quot; (Gwen + &quot;The Solution&quot;--which encourages adding food (like veggies, protein, grains) to your diet) has worked wonders for me.	1998-03-11

I've been reading about veganism for the past 10 years, and I have to say that Erik Marcus's book is one of the best!  The information is current (90s) and compelling.  It is extremely well written.  Compelling, yet not preachy, Erik tells the facts through glimpses into the lives of people and animals who have had a first-hand view of what goes on in the food industry.  His book also brings up the interesting issue regarding public lands that are rented out  to ranchers.  This is a MUST read book for any human being--omnivore or vegetarian. If you like this book, you may also enjoy any of John Robbins' or  Victoria Moran's books.  The only drawback?  We never get Erik's recipe for his fabulous cashew pizza!	1998-02-21
