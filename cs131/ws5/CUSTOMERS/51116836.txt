Talk about good, I don't know how to put this in words! I loved it! Brenda Jackson may have came out with a new family, but the talent behind the words is still the same. The story and the characters were great. I just loved how with so many different people in one story can have their own part to make the total package a must have!Brenda Jackson just keeps giving it to us and giving to us, you gotta love her! If you like this one, you have to get her other new release &quot;Surrender.&quot; It is also a must read. Much love Brenda! And don't stop what your doing girl!!	2001-09-16

I brought this book about eight months ago and I just finished reading it. When I started to read it eight months ago, it was so sad and I just cried and cried and I knew it was not going to end the way I wanted it to, so I stopped reading it.  Now eight months later I'm still crying.   I finished the book with tears in  my eyes. &quot;Everlastin' Love&quot; is a very powerful book, well it was for me.  I have never cried so much reading a book before. Don't get me wrong it was a great book, just a sad one.  For me personally, the first love was a sweet story in itself.  Qwayz and Jaz were a couple made in heaven.  I just wished that they had a forever type of romance. Now Kyle and Jaz 's relationship was great. Kyle had to be the most special man, because he loved Jaz enough not to pressure her about her feelings.  This book was a true lesson in love, loving someone so much you can let them go,taking your own happiness away so that there love of your life can be happy! A must, must, must read!! P.S. I'm still crying as I speak!	2000-12-14

I don't know about you, but this book took me to another place.  This novel had so much in it that it makes my breath catch! I mean the type of story it was, the characters, the love, the true to life issues, the things that African Americans go thourgh all to often, the people of the world go thourgh everyday was unreal.  I loved it. If you like Donna Hill, you will love her after this story of all stories.  Just think a correlation of love. affiars of the heart, politics, heart felt issues of today's society is faced with, family, fighting for what's right, and did I say Love, will love and let's not forget one of the best romance writers ever putting her own drama and passionate twist on things makes this one hell of a novel.  I know , belive me, I read it!! Hill did not half step with this one and boy does she keep her readers on the edge of their seats with some of the most passionate love scenes.  What else can I say about this book that is not good.  The book was the bomb!! Go out and get a copy, you'll get more then what you bargained for!!	2000-12-14

Wes was there to do a job, by any means necessary, and a seduction seemed perfect.  CJ on the other hand, had other things on her mind as well. CJ herself has had many a men.  Trying to to make a change in her life, but one look and she just had to have Wes. Even though it only started out just a seduction for both Wes and CJ, but love crept in somewhere and surpriased the both of them. A really good read!	2000-12-14

Even though it was a sweet love story, Ken struck me as a softy, and yes there is a such thing as being to soft, and Nique as a person that did now know exactly what she wanted! But I must say the suspense and mystery was the bomb! The story started out good but quickly slowed! This book did not keep my attetion for a very long and that is why it took me a long while to finish it.	2000-12-14

Again Forster has done it with another great book.  &quot;Secert Desire&quot; had me hooked from the very start.  I  love Forster and all but, she usually starts out slow and builds from there, but this one she jumps right in. I love it! This novel had a great storyline and some great characters.  It must be nice to have someone to call on when one needs help. Kate was one of those people, because Luke was always there for her when she need it the most.  A truly great read!	2000-12-14

US	51116836	R25MIPPQWQHJHO	1583141278	249344242	Simply Wonderful (Arabesque)	Books	2	1	3	N	N	This was simply not my cup of tea!!	First of all this was not a love story. I base my opinion on that observation.  Of course Daisy and Kenneth were the ideal romantic couple, but not in this story.  This book was a mystery or some type of suspense novel, plan and simple.  The storyline was perfect for a mystery novel.  But even looking at this novel form that aspect, this book still would be two stars, in my book.  The author swicthes charater thinking without making the cleat destinction.  One sentence Daisy was thinking about her day, then next Kenneth was thinking about his memory problem.  If that did not beat all, while in the middle of an important or significate part of the storyline, one character or another prolongs the situation about a good two pages thinking about stuff that has nothing to do with this very significate or important part of the story that is actually occurring at that moment. That had to be the thing that tick me off the most.  I have never been angry that a book took so long to end, and this book was just over 200 pages.  I don't know what happen, but the other Lewis book that I have read was nothing like this one. Simply Wonderful just did not have that romance quality to it in my opinion.  Sorry if too harsh! All luck to Lewis!	2000-12-14

Well she is in my book.  I loved Topaz.  This novel was very rich in Black Seminole and African American history,&quot;American History.&quot;  The characters in this one are truly unforgettable.  Dixon Wildhorse was a man after my own heart.  I reall don't blame Kate Love for falling in love with Dix even though the circumstances would suggest her dislike for him.  I loved the way their love developed for each other over time.  Even more Jenkins once again created characters that will be remembered for a long time to come.  It is one thing to have a great romance in a book, but when you add great history, great characters, and a great connection of all those things, the novel is truly in a class all by itself.  That ladies and gentlemen, can also be said about the author of that great novel.  Love you work, you, Beverly Jenkins, are truly in a class by yourself!!	2000-12-14

I was so caught up in the book at the beginning. So much was happening all at once, and a little confusing. So much mystery and suspense. But after that the book slowed down.  Then by the mid end of the book the story seemed finished, but was added on too.  But it was still an okay story, I found it sweet.  I love the part about the medical condition that many men seem not likely to discuss or acknowledge( extra in my book).	2000-12-14

If you love historical romance novels as I do, you'll love this one! This book was written so that it read like it was written by a veteran of historical romance. As I say before about Jenkins' novels, if you are in the mood for a great history lesson, just pick up one of her romance novels!! Vivid was a character any women could love because she repersented a strong women of her time that were determine to have careers that men usually held.  She was educated, dedicated, had her own opinion, and was a doctor to boot! It was just her luck to fall in love with Grayson Grove's handsome, stubborm, closed minded mayor Nate Grayson.  But Vivid had his mind wide open by the end of the book in more ways then one.  One could easily fall in love with their characters, along with all the other wonderful characters presented in this book! Another great read form the very talented Beverly Jenkins!!	2000-12-14

Every man should have a little Xavier Allgood in them.  I have decided to name my first boy, Xavier!! I am so impressed with this book.  I have never been this taken by a new author.  Whiteside has mad skills. And no it did not escape my mind, the fact that this book also held some major issues that we as people face everyday.

The storyline was good, but the way the author developed the story was lacking something.  I personally disliked the way the author wrote the story with more characters thinking than characters speaking an interacting with one another.  But that's just my opinion. Now the part about the religious extremist was well thought out, and they played a large role in the book, but the conclusion of their part in the story was weak! On a good note, I loved the characters.  Christian, a man that has seen the error of his ways and wants to really change this time around was great. And Delta was a fireball if I ever saw one, got to love her!  Sean and Christian's relationship was very, very steamy, if you know what I mean.  They seemed not to know that they were in fact in a relationship until the very end of the story! I wouldn't want to forget the part of the book that dealt with revenge, which in my opinion, I might add, was written very well. Not Taylor's best work, but work nontheless!!	2000-11-17

Ok, if this book seems that this book as not too hot, it wasn't! But it did have great characteristics of a mystery/suspense novel.  Hello, where was the romance? A fellow reviewer said something about not to expect good things from Poarch, but her pervious works are the bomb, it was just this book. Poarch is my girl, but I felt this book could have been more romantic than it was. Olivia and Clifton seemed to fall into the some type of partnership, before I know it they were in love and in a personal relationship, what's up with that! One minute their on a steakout, then all of a sudden in each others arms.  I just felt there should have been more romance, since it is being called a romance novel!! I loved the way Poarch brought to light the delicate issue of loving someone for who they are on the inside, instead of just the outside! It was a very easy read, but not at all what I am used to from Poarch to produce! But I'm still a big fan!	2000-11-17

I love it when a man drops everything to be with his woman. Okay, so it took Jordan a while to figure it out, but he did eventually! I love how Jordon and Christian met and fall in love. I liked the fact that the story did not focus on the past but on the present, but gave us just enough of the couple's history for us to have a good understanding of why the couple isn't doing so well in the present! I loved all the characters in this story.  Alex, Malcolm, Rosa, and Noah were great.  Alex and Malcolm's story was the little extra that made this book, in my eyes, the bomb! The development of each story was great.  And the ending was the best and very touching. I cried!! I loved it and I hope you like it to because it teaches us to forgive each other, put our pride aside, living our lives to the fullest, to always communicate with our loved ones, and to never ever put anything before the ones we love! Always remember, love conquers all!! Nice work Byrd!	2000-11-17

Max on the other hand is kind of stubborn and thinks he knows everything he wants in the world, and he swears it is not Christine.

Sorority Sister really did give me some insight on just a very small part of what being in a sorority is all about. I really enjoyed this book, I even got it autographed by the author herself.  The book was about five very different young ladies all dealing with some important life issues, all the while developing a bond that will last for all time.

Where a person loves you no matter what.  This also was one of my first novels that I have read and my first book by Thomas. It made a big impression on me to continue reading arabesque books! This book was a very good read. Thomas has mad skills in the writing department!	2000-11-09

Sneed sure does have talent if this book was any indication! I loved it. I have read it twice already.  I liked the storyline and the characters were great! Even though Cary seemed like a name for girl, but he was all man, my kind of man at that! If you love a suspense cat and mouse game and mystery, than you will love this book by Sneed! Great read, and much success to the author!	2000-11-09

At first I did not think I wanted to read this book, but I'm gald I did.  This book was off the chain! Sinclair was dreamy, my kind of man, tall, dark, and handsome. Talk about attacking some serious issues, Rhodes showed no mercy on the matter, things like church, community, what is wrong or right for certain people. I know a lot of people that can talk about the pros and cons of this for days. I really liked Sin, but you need to see for yourself, so go get a copy! Nice work!!	2000-11-09

Talk about an independent nature, Taylor must have received an A in that department.  I have not forgotten about Stone, he received an A in the Determination department! Those two are perfect for each other.  Okay, yes they are very different people, but they mush very well together.  At lest they will have a very exciting relationship, they most likely will never have a dull moment. I loved it! My favorite thus far from Moncia Jackson! Jackson does it again in a big way.  I think I read this one in two days, tops!  This was a very enjoyable read, so go get a copy!	2000-11-09

I did not like neither character, Mo or Reggie.  I liked the storyline though. I love it when two people get together when that person is not their norm! But I guess the bottom line was that there was to much insecurity in this novel for me to handle and then it just ends, what's up with that!! I know insecurity is a real to life issue, but this book was pushing it.  I mean if both people in a relationship is insecure about something that they see within themselves how is that relationship going to work! But of course, this is just my opinion on the matter!	2000-11-09

Jackson has done it again with her writing talent. &quot;Never to Late for Love&quot; was very moving.  It is a book about middle age adults falling in love in spite if all the obstacles that were put in there way.  Again Jackson talks about an issue that not common in the romance novel arena, Alcoholism. One last thought, I found Tiffany's son to be very weak individual, I wonder what's going to happen to him! Nice read!	2000-11-09

I liked their story a lot! Their story exemplifies the meaning of a strong and loving meeting and later marriage! But I must say in the beginning I got a little lost with the storyline, but things got clearer by the middle of the story! Had me kind of worried, because it seemed like the story was finished.  I was like &quot;Ok the story is solved, then why do I still have half of the book yet to finish.&quot; But Riley showed me that things are not always as they seem!	2000-11-09

Someone said something so bad that it made me go back and reread the whole book, but yet again I did not see any problems! I loved Layla abd Paul's relationship form start to finish!! Paul is a man that really take his cases too personal, especially when he takes them home with him, literally! I really, truly enjoyed this book! Nice read!!	2000-11-09

Trajan and Maya are crazy together.  In the beginning, I was wondering how these two people are going to fall in love with each other! I for one personally liked Trajan's name.  But I must say at times during the novel it was hard to follow. But overall it was an enjoyable read!	2000-11-09

I could not put it down. I read at home, when I went to work, when I wake up in the morning and just before I went to bed at night.  Island Magic was fantastic! Cassy and Gordon were great together.  I laughted at the fact they were arguing most of the story but still managed to get hot and heavy the rest of the book.  I guess you can say love sees no obstacles! Island Magic was a great read, go get a copy!	2000-11-09

I love that Ransom family.  I have been waiting to here about Laine's story, I must say I never expected that type of storyline. I really enjoyed it a lot. Regis and Laine's love was a love at first sight and it just kept getting better and better.  I read this one by Thomas in one setting.  If you like family sagas with one of a kind family members, than you will love Thomas's new work with the Ramson family.  And the very good thing is that Thomas is way from being finished with this crew.  Matt and Kaitlin's story is coming out next year, so be on the look out for it, it is sure to please!

The storyline could have been taken to a much higher level.  Once again, not a lot of dialogue.  But I must say the book made me want to to go to Egypt, the description was very good in this book.  True this book was very adventruous and the plot was good but the book's content does not express the plot out very well! bBt it was overall an ok book!	2000-11-09

This women has so much talent that it just spills out onto the paper.  Ok, I'm bias, but the Lady has mad skills (that means she is very good at what she does)! I just loved Nicholas, but of course he is Sterlings little brother.  Shayla 's character was the bomb! I loved this book.  And what was even better is that there was an update on Trevor and Corinthians,and Corinthians' best friend, Brenna, got a story in this book.  Her next book due out next year is Surrender, that's Ashton Sinclair's story. Brenda also has some work coming out with St. Martin's Press later this year and the next.

Back to Obsession, this book was the bomb with a capital &quot;B&quot;. I loved it, by far this is my fav by Forster.  Selena and Magnus were great together.  Magnus is a man that does not take no for an answer! I loved him in this story, he is my idea of a great man.  Even though he had some personal things to deal with, he still was a man to be reckoned with.  And all he needed was the right women to show him the error of his ways.  Selena was no miss perfect either, but Magnus helps her to learn that love can run deep.  Obsession was an excellent read.  Some may not like it but Forster has I writing style that grows on you! As you can see I'm a big fan.  Much love Forster!	2000-11-09

I agree with Crytal, five is definitely not enough! Ok, this is one of arabesque's best novels for the month of August. I absolutely loved this story.  Chloe and Devon were great together. I laughed so much reading this book.  &quot;Admission of Love&quot; was a very refreshing read.  I loved Chloe's character, she really knows how go after her man.  Devon put up a good fight, but was no match for the lovely wills Chloe put on him! The storyline for this book was one of my favorites, if not my favorite!  The idea behind two people really not liking each other when they initially meet, but passionate sparks fly between anyway is so good to me! This book really did remind me of my favorite book of all times &quot;Fire and Desire&quot; by Brenda Jackson.  That really means a lot coming from a die hard fan of Jackson's.  The girl can really throw down on some paper!! A very extremelly, I mean great read! Nice job Bryant!!	2000-11-09

I guess I just saw them a forever couple and that they were going to be ok in the long run, boy was I wrong! I understood the move behind that though. I mean if the relationship is not working for one or both of the people, you should go your seperate ways.  April was not on my favorite people's list at the end of the book. If you let someone go then let the good for good!  I liked cousin Drew, I loved his character a lot in the story.  Whatelse do you expect with a Crawford man.  Michael was lovely.  It seemed to me that Terra had more than one personality.  They were right for each other, did not take me long to figure that out. But all and all it was a good book!!	2000-11-09

Jenkins is truly in a class all by herself with the brilliant talent that she continues to display in her elegantly written historical romance novels, and of course Through the Storm was no exception! I loved this story! Again the history talked about in this one was overwhemling.  I have yet to see so much information in any book that I have read.  The characters in this one are to die for! Galeno and Hester Bachon are a perfect pairing, even though I have yet to read their story,Indigo.  I know it will be good! But I can not forget Bridget, Andre, Araminta, Juliana, Henri, The Brats: Drake, Archer, Phillipe, and Beau Le Veq.  I loved the set up of the book, the way it was split into two halves.  One of Sable and Raimond's meeting and parting, then one of their reunion! Sable and Raimond were something else together, the both of them gave as good as they got! This was truly a delightful story that I recommend everyone to read!	2000-11-09

All I can say about Ms Larsen is that she was a very determined young woman. I mean what else would you say about someone who put up with a man like Sheldon Turner.  The man had to be the most blind , stubborn, and noncommital person in the world, if he could not see what a great catch Daryl was.  A few times in the book I wanted Daryl to just drop him because he was not worth all the stuff he was putting her through, but of course she didn't agree with me.  All and all &quot;A Resolution of Love&quot; was a very good read!	2000-11-09

Ok, I thought Rosie's Curl and Weave was the bomb, but Della's House of Style was off the chain! That means really good, the best, words like that! My favorite story in the Anthology has to be Hill's It Could Happen to You.  I wish it would! I really enjoyed Hill's way with words.  I loved the reintroduction of her daughter's story from Rosie's Curl and Weave. This story was a love at first sight type of love, I mean what else can you call it.  Matt and Della are a couple that most people wish they were like, I do anyway! But never the less, great work by Hill!<br />Mason's Truly, Honestly was a great way to end the Anthology.  Love knows no social status, job position, or bank account, it just sees to hearts that needs to be together.  I loved it. I am a fan of Mason and she really did her work justice! Nice work Mason!<br />Aler's Sweet Surrender was a very nice touch.  Don't you love it when a man showers you with beautiful things that you did not ask for or need, I do anyway! I thought it was sweet.  I would love to have a Carmeron King in my life! Love your work, much love Alers!<br />And Ray's A Matter of Trust was great! I may be a little bais because I am a big fan of Ray. But her story was the bomb! Love it when a women really bests a man, especially when he doubts one or some of a woman's many talents! Because Hope rally shows Sebastian a thing or two.  She practically has the man eating out of her hand in more ways then one!! A Matter of Trust is my second favorite story in this Anthology, if yoy did not figure it out yet! Much love Ray!! <br />I can not wait until these authors release more books that will show their talent to a level all their own!	2000-11-09

They were great apart but together they are very unique, and boy do the sparks fly when they are together! What a great adventure those two took together on their love voyage.

The sad thing is that there are people out there like Miss Lena that lead a life just hers, not having friends and not knowing anything about the outside world! But just like Lena did they can come into themselves only if they would just try.  I know I went a little off on that, but that is how I feel about this story.

The lost love storyline is what caught my eye because I love those type of stories, but as the story inveils itself, it was not much of a love story.  But I am glad I read the story for myself to see just how the book was all about.  Many a person had told me that it was not all that good, always be your own judge!

Tony and Sameerah(love that name)had spark flying all  across the room when they first met and continuned through the whole story.   I'm not forgetting the other great characters in this book: the band, the  twins, Tree, Izzy, oh and Ms Chantal. I was really hoping something bad  would have happen to her(I know that's bad,but).

Much Love to Ms Sims,  from one of your fans!   Ms Perrin's &quot;Maternal Instincts,&quot; was  also very good.  Lexy was a very lucky woman to live out a dream that not  many women get a chance to live out, and that is to spend the rest of your  life with your crush from High School.  Under the circumstances that Lexy  and Marcel finally came together under, the love story that they share with  a little help from a 10 year-old going on thirty, is something truly  special!  Much love to Ms Perrin! Well I can't say much about Ms Wright's  novella because I have not finished it yet! I will sometime soon, but not  at the moment.  I did start the story, but it was just I'm sad to say  boring.  Not to down the author, because some of her stuff is good. &quot;A  Mother's Love&quot; was just about a mother spending mother's day alone and  her remembering the past.
