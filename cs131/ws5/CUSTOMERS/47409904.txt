The Pet Rock was, if you hadn't heard, an actual pebble. It was packaged into a little cardboard box. I don't remember what it cost - but word was that millions of them sold. People everywhere I went marveled for a moment - they didn't so much WANT a \\"Pet Rock\\" as they wanted to come up with something that EVERYONE WANTED and were willing to pay for.<br /><br />Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is the literary equivalent. It is not great literature by any means, but neither are Grisham, Clancy, etc. It's a reasonably well-told, well-thought out story that hits people in a way that makes them want to get the book, read it, then tell their friends \\"you've GOT to read this book\\".<br /><br />In telling his tale he recycles some old obscure religious thoughts that absolutely flies in the face of the Catholic Church and what everyone \\"knows\\" about Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail. He must be laughing all the way to the bank at the many Catholic and Historic scholars who are heaping tons of free publicity on his book, thinking that they are trying to dispute his fictional tale.<br /><br />It's a quick read - about 450 pages with 103 chapters. He writes his chapters with little mini cliff-hangers the way Entertainment Tonight goes into a commercial break with a teasing line like \\"wait 'til you SEE what Britney/Tom Cruise/Madonna/Kobe Bryant\\" did! It does make it a page-turner.<br />I was burning through about 100 pages an hour, and it kept me engaged.<br /><br />So - if you haven't read it, should you? There are better thrillers. If you have staunch religious beliefs you may be offended. If you like sticking it to the Catholic Church it may tickle you. If you want to know what the buzz is about, it only takes a couple of hours to find out...	2005-07-01

I was surprised to hear that Mario Puzo wrote \\"The Godfather\\" after attempts at \\"literature\\" hadn't provided enough income.  According to the source I read he wrote this book for the money. What can I say?  I heard Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for the same reason.<br /><br />Whatever his inspiration, Puzo's tale is one I couldn't put down.  I don't know how many today read the book before seeing Coppola's movie - one of the greatest films by almost any measurement.  I read the book back in the 70s before seeing the film, and the movie vividly brought the characters in my head to life.  The advantage in the book is that Coppola is able to allow you inside the heads of the characters and flesh out much of the back and side stories.  Remember the undertaker who opens the movie, asking for the Godfather to render justice to the two punks who violated his daughter then were set free by the American court?  In the book we find out what happens to those punks.  The movie star Johnny Fontaine is fleshed out with a little Hollywood Babylon.  We get to read the story of the young Vito Corleone and how he came to become \\"The Godfather\\" - a story that doesn't show up in until the second movie with DeNiro as young Vito and Bruno Kirby brilliant as the young Tessio.  We find out how the Irish kid Tom Hagen becomes like an adopted son to the Godfather and how his intelligence enables him to go to law school and become the Godfather's next Consigliore.  We get to find out about the fearful Luca Brasi and why he's pretty much the only man that makes Vito Corleone a little nervous.<br /><br />Puzo creates a fictional world that is rich and profound and populated by larger than life characters.  Only recommended for those who want to read the quintessential gangster novel.	2004-12-20

I was so impressed by that volume that I immediately read - and also admired - his biographies of Thomas Jefferson (American Sphinx) and John Adams (Passionate Sage).<br /><br />Ellis knows this period COLD - as well as any historian putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard) today.  But he also knows the warm flesh and blood of the Revolutionary Generation as well.<br /><br />Reading \\"His Excellency\\" compared to other published biographies of George Washington is like standing next to the Man himself compared to standing next to a statue of the man - or even more distant, next to the Washington Monument or the \\"heads\\" side of a quarter.<br /><br />All biographers of Washington have begun with forewords that talk about the iconic Washington of the dollar bill and other cold and impersonal images - and how they want to write so that you can know the human side.  Mr. Ellis succeeds in this task in a way that makes Washington live and breathe.<br /><br />He makes it clear that although Benjamin Franklin was wiser, John Adams better read, Alexander Hamilton more brilliant and Thomas Jefferson more intellectual - they ALL considered George Washington the pre-eminent figure of the Revolutionary Generation.  When it came time for the constitutional convention Franklin privately told Washington that no one else could lead such an enterprise and that the final result would be inferior without his input.  When that constitutional convention mandated that a President be elected as Chief Executive of the Nation - no other candidate was even seriously considered.<br /><br />Ellis allows us to see the man and the humanity and the excellence of character that made some of the greatest men in our history clamor to Washington for leadership.  Over and over again Washington set aside his personal life and opportunity for personal gain to instead answer the call to the service of his country - and Washington could claim the United States as *His* country more than any American before or since.<br /><br />The clearest biography of the Leader of the Founding Fathers yet.  Not the longest, not the most comprehensive, but Ellis has chipped away the chaffe to leave a polished gem that shines on every page.

There is something that Humor and Horror have in common: Different people think that different things are funny or scary.  Not everyone loves Monty Python and the Holy Grail.... but for those who do, it is the absolute pinacle of film humor.<br /><br />I bought this book just before boarding a plane, and I laughed until I cried the whole flight.  I could see people turning their heads... craning to see what in the world could be making someone laugh so hard.<br /><br />If this book were *only* funny - that would be enough.  But there is a reasonably plausible thriller-crime story wrapped in there too.<br /><br />The characters are bizarre.  There is a bum who begins the book getting picked up in a van which ferries him around to different polling places in Miami where he casts votes in place of people who have died at 10 dollars a vote.  At the end of the day the van deposits him in Coconut Grove where he decides to spend his 35 dollars - the most money he has EVER had - on beer.  He finds out that beers in upscale CG are 5 bucks each - \\"which Puggy thought was way high, even for a guy pulling down ten dollars a vote\\".  We meet renegade Russian arms dealers, crazy cops, poisoned toads and our hero - who amazingly was a Miami newspaperman like Dave Barry!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Big Trouble was turned into a movie starring some very talented people which was as bland and humorless as the book was brilliant and hilarious.  I mention it because if you saw the movie and thought \\"oh... that stinks\\" but you thought \\"hmmmm... I would have thought the book would have been better than that since Dave Barry wrote it\\" and you were thinking \\"should I read this book or not.....\\" my recommendation is:<br /><br />Read it.  But only if you're ready to laugh your head off.  It helps if you're already familiar with Barry's writing and already think he's the funniest American writer since Samuel Clemens.	2004-10-20

I bet Ben & Jerry won't mind my saying I love Haagen Dazs' Rum Raisin and Breyer's Butter Pecan and there's hardly anything more decadent than one of those Chocolate Dove Bars.<br /><br />Ben & Jerry's is over the top, double-dog wicked good.  They obviously got the idea of picking out big chunks of great-tasting items and putting them into their ice cream.  Some of their flavors are so full of big chunks of chocolate, delicious nuts and flavorful fruits it seems like you can hardly find the ice cream for the goodies!<br /><br />Ben & Jerry's is also a Great-American success story of a \\"Mom and Pop\\" business that started out with a couple of guys who wanted to make good ice cream.<br /><br />This book is a bargain for Ice Cream lovers.  You get easy-to-use recipes for hundreds of ice creams and other desserts - with favorites like \\"Cherry Garcia\\" and \\"Heath Bar Crunch\\".  You also get a mini-history of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream company with interesting tidbits like their fight to allow their Ice Cream to be sold in groceries against one of the food superpowers, who was trying to push Ben & Jerry aside.  If B&J hadn't won that legal battle it's unlikely you or I would have ever heard of them and their wonderful ice creams, but it's still fun to read the first-person of this little New England David slaying the corporate Goliath.  Ben & Jerry are well-known for their support of environmental-friendly causes, and they also struck a wonderful blow for free enterprise!  Anyway - read more about that in the book.<br /><br />The book includes fantastic recipes, but also juicy tidbits - things you can do to your ice-cream or ingredients to make them \\"creamier\\" or have more \\"mouthfeel\\".  For you cooks who love to experiment in the kitchen, this book gives you a great starting place - they give you several excellent \\"starter\\" base recipes.  Then, once you've got your basic vanilla or chocolate (and they give you variations on each, along with their two cents about what makes one different from another) you can go crazy and add your own goodies.<br /><br />Almost all of the recipes are to make a quart or quart and a half - exactly the right amount to go in one of those great new electric ice-cream makers.

Of all the founding Fathers President/General Washington seemed one of the most ethereal, least concrete figures of all.  The earthy and witty Benjamin Franklin and the enigmatic Thomas Jefferson seem relatively easy to \\"know\\" in comparison.<br /><br />Flexner produces a man who stood shoulders above the other Giants at the founding of the United States.  Not nearly as well-educated as Jefferson, Franklin or John Adams, and with a military tactician's ability that seemed rudimentary, he nonetheless had an aura of a man who seemed incapable of doing anything other than the \\"right thing\\".  When the Continental Congress was choosing a General to lead the Army, no one other than Washington was seriously considered.  When the Continental Convention was called, initially only to revise the weak Articles of Confederation, there was no other choice to preside over the convention.  Initially he hadn't seriously considered GOING to the Constitutional Convention, but Benjamin Franklin - older and wiser - recognized that Washington MUST go to the convention or it would not be recognized as having authority.  After the Constitution was written and ratified Washington had the easiest Presidential campaign ever - all he had to do was not decline the office.<br /><br />We get a view of Washington the man as well: the woman he truly loved who he didn't get to marry,  his wrong decisions in early military campaigns, his distaste for developing \\"party politics\\".<br /><br />It would be difficult to imagine a single volume biography on this Great American superior to this one.	2004-08-25

Williams is edited by the staff at Parkland, the largest Obstetric hospital in the U.S. and not surprisingly, they consider their text to be &quot;the premier source for the specialty&quot;.

This is NOT to say that Gabbe is &quot;OB for Dummies&quot; or a cliff-notes version of an OB text: As Department Head of OB/GYN at a Major Hospital, I find Gabbe both authoritative and complete.<br />Cutting to the chase: Gabbe is easier to read than Williams, and if you need info more in-depth, you should already be a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology anyway (or at least a junior fellow), which means that you're accessing the ACOG website on-line anyway.	2004-07-15

I remember going through my clinical rotations and thinking that I needed a &quot;pocket&quot; book for every medical rotation to supplement my massive 20-pound, $100 texts while I was on the wards and in the clinic.<br />Early into my OB/GYN Residency I got the hot scoop - THIS is the book to keep in your lab-coat if you're practicing OB/GYN.  By the time I was a chief resident this book had saved me time and heartache and saved my patients from my blunders over and over.  Like all &quot;pocket&quot; texts, this one doesn't contain lengthy discussions.  But it DOES contain what you need to get through that night on OB/GYN call.

If snakes or spiders or great-white sharks scare the peedoodle out of you, then your reaction to a story about them might be different than it might be for, say The Crocodile Hunter.<br />Stephen King is prolific beyond belief.  He is sometimes redundant.  In Pet Sematary he wrote a story so compelling that I literally could not put it down, yet at the same time so horrifying that I practically screamed at myself NOT TO TURN THE NEXT PAGE!!!!<br />King knows a thing or two about humans and human relationships, and in Pet Sematary he creates a realistic family that you care about.... then he does absolutely TERRIFYING things to them.  Without giving anything away - I have to say that one of the reasons that this book affected me so deeply is that I had recently become a Dad back when this book first was released, and this book hones in on a new parent's worst nightmares, then just gets worse and worse and worse.<br />If you like being scared by a book, and you can't think of anything worse than seeing your child killed - this book might hit you like it hit me.  I repeat: This is the scariest novel I have ever read.<br />As an aside: The &quot;scariest book ever&quot; was turned into a fairly cheesy movie.  I give the book a solid 5 stars, but wouldn't rate the film any higher than 2 or 3.  Another aside: My personal choice for &quot;scariest movie&quot; is &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, while I found the novel of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; fairly bland and not paced well enough to scare me.	2004-07-15

Ellis knew that he wanted to write a book that wouldn't crush you to death if you fell asleep under it.  Library shelves are full of large ponderous historical volumes that, let's face it, hardly anyone reads.  Ellis has turned his historical microscope on a handful of key individuals and moments and the result is a very satisfying read.<br />This book made me understand what was going on in the minds of the individuals involved better than any history I'd previous read.<br />The book begins with the fatal duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, often a simple paragraph in many history books. In Ellis' work we get a sense of not only actually being present during the duel itself, but also inside the minds of both men in the months leading up to the event.  It seems incredible today to think that the Vice President of the United States killed the Secretary of the Treasury in a duel, but Ellis brings the event back to life in a way more vivid than any I'd previously experienced.<br />With a similarly knowing eye, the book looks at a landmark dinner held by Thomas Jefferson in which the decision to move the nation's capital to the Potomac was made in exchange for support for Alexander Hamilton's financial plan.  A most enlightening chapter looks at the first significant debate after the Constitutional Convention on the subject of the future of Slavery, precipitated by the leader of the Pennsylvania Assembly - Benjamin Franklin.  We get to see the context of George Washington's Farewell Address.  John Adams is featured frequently in the book.  There is a chapter detailing the long and mutually supportive relationship between John and Abigail Adams, then the final chapter describes the rekindling of the friendship between Adams and Jefferson four decades after the Revolution.  This chapter contrasts essentially the two views that have existed ever since about the *meaning* of the Revolution and of the Founding of the United States.<br />Although they were miles apart, both geographically and idealogically, Adams and Jefferson kept alive a friendship and mutual respect that would serve as a wonderful model for politicians ever since.re miles apart, both geographically and idealogically, Adams and Jefferson kept alive a friendship and mutual respect that would serve as a wonderful model for politicians ever since.	2004-06-29

Margaret Wise Brown recognized that, and so did Dr. Seuss.  Berkeley Breathed knows it too, and in this book he pays tribute to Ms. Brown's classic bedtime story \\"Goodnight Moon\\".<br />But Mr. Breathed knows about more than rhyming.  He is still plugged into that part of his child brain that can imagine as big as all outdoors.  He remembers when a blanket stretched across a couple of chairs could be a \\"fort\\", or when the best toy that could show up in a neighborhood was the big cardboard box that somebody's new fridge came in.<br />So Goodnight Opus combines those two elements - paying tribute to \\"Goodnight Moon\\" while not ridiculing it, but also inviting the reader to \\"leave the text\\" and let our imaginations run wild.<br />Sometimes the simplest and most gentle lessons are the best.

His talents brought him wealth and fame and a Pulitzer Prize from his wonderful work on the 'toon \\"Bloom County\\".  Feeling an itch for something a little different, Mr. Breathed began working on children's books and this picture book couldn't be more delightful if you had combined the talents of Gary Trudeau, Norman Rockwell and Dr. Seuss.<br />The Santa in this story isn't the robust, jolly old North Pole Elf from many other tales.  In fact, he is a little infirmed and being looked after by the other elves.  His hearing is less than perfect, and one of the key moments in the book comes when he thinks he hears \\"treed\\" when our hero Red Ranger has actually said \\"tweed\\".  But by the end of the tale I felt myself getting a little choked up as Santa and Red come through for each other and restore each other's faith in the spirit of Christmas.<br />The illustrations are fanciful and colorful and allowed me to read a book which SHOULD have been way over the head of my 3 year old niece.  She immediately made me read it again, then promise to read it to her again tomorrow.	2004-06-21

These strips were written back when fat and cholesterol were the bad foods instead of carbs.  Various plotlines include jabs at Hollywood with a sequel to the classic \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\": \\"Kill Mo' Mockingbird\\".  Steve Dallas defends Bill the Cat of his murderous fake chainsaw rampage a'la the OJ trial, then Steve hi-jacks Oliver Wendell Jones' time machine to go chase ambulances through history, running into Calamity Janes, Lady Godiva, Adolf Hitler and a caveman, circa 10,000 B.C.<br />Opus winds his way through the final Outland strips much as he did at the end of Bloom County, ending with a poignant reunion with a loved family member thought long gone.<br />In the final part of the book Mr. Breathed lets us in on some of his favorite strips and private thoughts in a way I haven't seen in other places.  He tells us the anecdotes of communications he has received from Leonard Nimoy, Caspar Weinburger, President Reagan, \\"Mockingbird\\" Author Harper Lee, and he describes the evolution of characters originally intended to appear for only a moment who then became cornerstones of the Breathed 'toon empire: Opus and Bill the Cat.  Good stuff for the Breathed collector.	2004-06-21

This is the first Outland collection, and Berkeley Breathed writes in the introduction:<br />&quot;I'm proud of the 'toons in this book. I had more fun drawing many of these than usual. As in Bloom County usual.  Look at the earlier Outlands reproduced here.  You can see me playing, experimenting, even doodling, looking for unexplored nooks and creative crannies.  But when I look at these myself, I smile because I know that like the wild caribou, I was doomed to return to familiar territory.  Outland is, of course, Bloom County without the continuing narrative that a daily appearance allows.  But Bloom County was never about children or cats or penguins.  It was about a loopy perspective - my dubious legacy to this world, and in plentiful evidence within this volume.  Enjoy.  I have.

Breathed was an absolute genius at seeing some topical issue of the day (circa 1984 for this voume) holding it up to the light so that we could see it just the way that he did, then skewering the thing with what would be the humor equivalent of cupid's arrow.	2004-06-15

So.... depending on if you want a chronological collection of the BC Strips, or to complete ALL of the BC Books, this is either the 4th or 5th volume of Bloom County, and Berkeley Breathed is still in high-gear producing the funniest 'toon strip I've ever read.  And by \\"funny\\" I mean laugh-out-loud, roll on the floor, tears streaming down my face, people coming into the room to see \\"WHAT are you laughing at?!!!?\\" kind of laugh.<br />In \\"Billy and the Boingers\\" Steve Dallas, the sleazy womanizing ambulance-chasing lawyer, finally decides that even HE has had it with defending murderers and child abusers.  Bill the cat inspires him to hold auditions for a \\"New high-profit heavy-metal rock band\\".  Requirements are only \\"Need to know 3 chords and be able to grimace musically\\".<br />Along the way Opus the Penguin gets engaged to sweetie Lola Granola, and the new Heavy Metal Group \\"Death-Tongue\\" makes their pitch in Los Angeles to recording companies, ending with a memorable visit backstage at an Ozzy Osbourne concert - back when Ozzy was the \\"Elvis of Heavy Metal\\".  Back in Bloom County Steve discovers that he must give up cigarette smoking or his life expectancy is 6 months.  He has Opus tie him to a chair where he is the model of self-control for 38 whole minutes before he breaks down and tells Opus \\"Get me a (...) cigarette before I stick you in a blender\\".

My eyes must have nearly popped out of my head and I had to walk over and gently remove these hefty volumes from the protective box. The price tag caught the corner of my eye and I have to be honest - you have GOT to be a hard-core comic lover to drop over 80 bucks for a collection of comics.  The Mrs. gave me a funny look.  &quot;You don't need THAT, do you?&quot; Turns out the Mrs. had secretly just purchased this very collection as a present.  What a wife! You still with me?  If you can see yourself spending 90 dollars buying a &quot;comic book&quot; - you've got to get this collection.<br />Gary Larson doesn't have quite the visual flair of Bill Watterson or Berkely Breathed, but the lack of artistic sophistication is part of the charm of this fantastic series.  Crude line drawings get right to the point and Larson's captions hit the nail squarely on the head.<br />In the universe of the Far Side cows and ducks and often microscopic organisms have equal status with humans.  Larson looks at many of our most commonly held misconceptions and frailties, has us gaze into the mirror, then twists the mirror to hilarious result.<br />To &quot;get&quot; the Far Side requires some basic education.  You have to know about bacteria and space exploration and a little history to know what the heck the joke is, but he doesn't pander to us.  It's also decidedly NOT all &quot;high-brow&quot;.  My personal favorite frame shows the aftermath of a messy barroom brawl, with bodies and broken furniture strewn about.  A barmaid is trying to explain to a cop how &quot;the little sailor guy&quot; went crazy after eating some spinach and crazy music started playing.  How many episodes of &quot;Popeye&quot; would you have to see to &quot;get&quot; that joke?  I don't know - but knowledge of the folklore about Popeye is essential for that joke.  He similarly skews fairy tales along with legends about vampires and devils and angels.<br />Another fantastic element to this collection are Mr. Larson's insightful comments which separate the &quot;chapters&quot; - describing some of his inspirational process as well as struggles he encountered along the way trying to produce The Far Side.joke?

After Tom Sawyer was a big hit the publisher, perhaps understandably, wanted not only a sequel, but one which logically followed Tom Sawyer.  They specifically desired for the two works to sit comfortably on a shelf together.  Perhaps there was a time when Mark Twain desired the same thing - more of the same crowd pleasing story telling. But I think that perhaps from the beginning he recognized that he now had the audience that he wanted for his masterpiece, so he began writing it.<br /><br />Even in the form which was familiar for 100 years Huckleberry Finn was widely hailed as the centerpiece of American Literature. THIS edition reveals that the masterpiece as originally conceived was even more masterly.<br /><br />Clemens wrote the original manuscript and submitted it to the publisher.  I don't know what they thought of the book as it was, but one thing was clear: it was a good deal longer than Tom Sawyer and sitting side by side with Tom Sawyer the two books looked less like a \\"pair\\".<br /><br />So.... the editorial pruning process began and enough was removed from the originally conceived Huckleberry Finn to create both the originally published versions of Huck as well as \\"Life on the Mississippi\\".<br /><br />Now we finally get to see the \\"complete Huck\\".  The missing text flows along with the \\"original Huck\\" as mightily as the Mississippi that Huck and Jim ride along in the book of our dreams.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, we also are treated to original illustrations and facsimile reproductions of several of Twain's original text.  I found these pages among the most enlightening of all.  Almost as if he knew his handwritten pages would be looked at by posterity, Twain used a unique revision technique.  Rather than erasing a word or passage he wishes to replace, he would instead line through the words in a single line, leaving the replaced word legible along with the words which would replace the revised word.  By examining these hand-written lines we can see how meticulous Twain was in his word selection.  In several of the passages he made slight corrections which were plainly intended to make the runaway slave, Jim, as noble as possible.  It has long been a curiosity to me that this book, frequently criticized as \\"racist\\", has as it's two central characters a runaway slave and the \\"poor white trash\\" boy who decides to help him.  At one point Huck is memorably torn between what the Southern Society he has been raised in says is right and what gnaws at his conscience. It is obviously an unqualified truth to Huck that Jim is uneducated and so poor that he doesn't even own himself, yet Jim possesses more humanity than any of the \\"civilized\\" southerners Huck meets.  Seeing Clemens' own scrawl lets us see how diligently Clemens worked to make that distinction clear - that Jim is easily the most noble adult in the book.<br /><br />I agree with Mr. Hemingway - Huckleberry Finn IS America's greatest novel.  Thanks to rediscovering Twain's original text (and an entertaining sequence of events which is detailed in the introduction to this edition) we finally get to read America's greatest Novel the way that the author originally intended.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough.unique revision technique.

No other strip made me laugh as hard, or as often, as &quot;Bloom County&quot;.  In fact, pretty much nothing else in the whole wide world made me laugh as hard as this divine creation of Mr. Berke Breathed.  Here we are introduced to the Milo Bloom, Steve Dallas, Cutter John and by far the best-known comic Penguin ever - Opus.<br />Here we can see that Bloom County was just crackling with creativity and a real desire to &quot;cut loose&quot; from the beginning. Some of the strips covered &quot;current events&quot; and were topical, meaning circa 1980, but if you were around for any of that time it's a nostalgic trip back to the days of Boy George and when Ozzy Osbourne was best known as a singer. But the vast majority of the strips ring very true today as they deal with the absurdities of the human animal.<br />A word about the format:  Bloom County in it's original form included both the standard &quot;3 panel&quot; strips that appear in your every day newspaper in black and white, plus a larger full page color version for the Sunday paper.  The other Bloom County volumes (as well as Bloom's sequel &quot;Outland&quot;) were in a larger physical book form.  (Similar to what you may have seen if you're a collector of, say, Calvin and Hobbes, or Dilbert). This first volume is a smaller book (similar in format to the endless volumes of Garfield which became available).  But this is where it all began, and it includes much of the &quot;best stuff&quot;.<br />If you want to know what America was laughing at in 1980, this is it.  But you know what?  I reread these strips every so often, and they STILL make me laugh that loud, roll on the floor, tears streaming down my face, people coming into the room to see WHAT are you laughing at kind of laugh.  We don't get that kind of laugh often enough. Thank you, Mr. Breathed.	2004-06-14

These three worked together frequently and prominently as the United States was being created, yet they were quite dissimilar except for their commitment to the success of American Independence.  Adams was a pious, hard-working New Englander - a stark contrast to the Benjamin Franklin who was a generation older, not particularly religious, fond of his leisure time, and with an eye for the ladies, even in his later years.  The Northerner Adams thought slavery evil, yet was able to reconcile his personal feelings ably enough to develop a fond life-long friendship and working relationship with the slave-owning Virginian Jefferson.  One of the most enjoyable portions of this book is the depiction of the two former Presidents in their later years, trading correspondence about the &quot;good old days&quot; after reconciling from a feud which was likely precipitated by the Mischief-causing Hamilton.<br />This book is a pleasure to read and unless you are already a Revolutionary Scholar of the highest order, you'll learn a few things as well.<br />I recommend it highly.	2004-05-06

Like many southerners of his generation, Lewis Grizzard grew up as a democrat, surrounded by democrats.  Why?  Well because Abraham Lincoln had been a Republican, of course, and there are still Southerners who are sore about the Civil War, but they're generally the kind of people who are sore about most things.  Grizzard's fellow southerners were mostly bible-thumping conservatives and this book examines changes that began to occur in Grizzard's thinking - such as the realization that his political ideology was REALLY more in concert with the Republicans.  Similarly, he had grown up in the 50s and 60s thinking that he was a rock and roll rebel and relishing the rhythms of Elvis and Carl Perkins - but as he grew up he recognized that his musical tastes were now more along the lines of Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard than what was passing for &quot;rock and roll&quot; 15 years ago.<br />Lewis doesn't apologize for his views - and in America he shouldn't have to - and if his opinions offend you I'm sorry someone held a gun to your head and made you read his book!  But if you can get over any eagerness to be offended I think you'll find Lewis Grizzard an observant and funny chronicler of the human condition.	2004-05-06

Brands must have been a doozy back at school.  Once given an assignment for a research paper I can see Brands asking &quot;Can I do twice as many references as required?&quot;<br />I'm poking fun a little to make the point that this is a scholarly and well-researched portrait of Franklin.  Brands doesn't seem to make any points that are not backed up by some written reference, and any time there is speculation Brands' language makes it clear that this is a thought extrapolated from available knowledge.<br />I almost wanted to give the work 4 rather than 5 stars because my initial response was that although the book was good, I also thought that if there's anything this book needs, it's a little pruning. This biography is so exhaustively complete that there is little time to pause.  ALL of the information is presented, and it got a little mentally tiring separating the wheat from the chaff. (Does this make me like the Emperor who informs Mozart his new opera has &quot;too many notes&quot;?) From the language of this book Mr. Franklin's early work in the printing business in Philadelphia comes across with as much force as his later participation in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.<br />Brands gives us a good feel for Benjamin Franklin's standing in the world community - not only in Philadelphia and America, but also in Europe and around the world.  We also get a little of a taste for Franklin's indulgences in woman and for the periods in his life when he was reluctant to assume the role of &quot;family man&quot;.<br />At the end when the great citizen Dr. Franklin passed away James Madison passed the news to the new congress and suggested that a National Period of Mourning be observed - a measure that must have been one of the first official acts of Congress to pass immediately and unanimously.  The word quickly spread to France where their assembly also unanimously voted to immediately don black to mourn The First American.<br />Among Biographies, in particular of our Founding Fathers, this one stands up well, and should for as long as people care to read about the amazing Benjamin Franklin., in particular of our Founding Fathers, this one stands up well, and should for as long as people care to read about the amazing Benjamin Franklin.	2004-05-06
US	47409904	RGQLCEH74N5T8	0316803812	95422248	Can't You Hear Me Callin': The Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass	Books	4	3	6	N	Y	Currently the &quot;Definitive&quot; Bill Monroe Biography	This work is meticulously and exhaustively researched and includes wonderful stories and insights into the personality of the &quot;Father of Bluegrass&quot;.  So many other reviewers have remarked here about how interesting (and sometimes previously unrevealed) many of the stories are, in particular with regard to his need to be with many women.  But one of the great attributes of this book is giving some insight into Mr. Monroe's music - his genious of a gift for &quot;pulling music out of the air&quot; and his innovation in turning the previously muddling mountain rhythms of his youth into a driving force of nature that was propelled forward by the bark of his Lloyd Loar Gibson F-5.  The stories behind the creation of &quot;Little Georgia Rose&quot; and &quot;Can't You Hear Me Calling&quot;, among others, were unknown to me, and I found fascinating and frankly poignant.<br />I consider this the definitive biography of one of the absolute giants of American music.	2004-04-28

This &quot;book&quot; is essentially a fleshed out magazine article, but it's a good one.  Less than 100 pages and written in a style that moves right along while giving you a &quot;you are there&quot; first person sense,  it's an enlightening way to pass an hour or two.<br />Mr. Piazza has a keen and insightful sense of Jimmy Martin's musical genius and place in Bluegrass History, and to me the most poignant moments in the book are when the writer is moving to shield or protect the intoxicated, loud-mouthed King of Bluegrass from injuring his already mussed reputation.  As he observes, much of what makes Jimmy Martin &quot;great&quot; also dooms him to the edges of the limelight and that Grand Ol' Opry Membership that Jimmy Martin yearns for so badly will likely never happen, exactly for the reason of his unwillingness to back down or compromise.<br />This isn't a &quot;biography&quot; so much as a thumbnail sketch of who Jimmy Martin is framed in a skillful depiction of a few volatile hours spent with a prime example of the &quot;Tortured Artist&quot;.<br />I can't help but wonder if a well-written first-person account of a weekend spent with Van Gogh would have been eerily similar.	2004-04-02

His monologues, the &quot;News from Lake Wobegon&quot;, have always been the centerpiece of PBS's wildly successful Prairie Home Companion, and I have found none of his stories to be superior to those contained within this collection.<br />Pastor Inqvist's Trip to Orlando is worth the price of these cassettes alone with the story of the humble Lutheron Minister and his desire to please his Church Deacons and Mrs. Inqvist at the same time.  The Gospel Birds is another &quot;church&quot; story, but you'd be wrong if you came to a listen thinking that Mr. Keillor is simply a &quot;holy roller&quot; trying to pound his version of &quot;the gospel&quot; into anyone.<br />His stories are about what makes us human - our nobleness and our failings - and his storytelling is so skillful, he allows us to hear that our shortcomings are as important in who we are as our triumphs.	2004-03-29

I should rather eat a tub of miscrient toads than NOT read the book following this one- Firewing. I read this book in one day. I devoured it and then nibbled at it like a dog might nibble on an obliterated bone. It is the absolute best book I have read since Ella Enchanted!	2002-12-13

I love languages- like saying the elvish in Lord of the Rings. I loved trying to read gnomich and elvish and giantish even more. I would practice every word until I got it perfect.<br />  Ella is pert and hostile to the world. Like me. She hates having people decide for her.<br />  Hattie is wretched. I have never met [as far as books go, and fortunatly not in the real world either] a more sadistic, pernicious character. I loathed her and Olive as much as anyone could possibly hate anyone else. She is not a fearsome idol [as is Mr. Doom in Dave at Night.] She is stupid and souly jarring.<br />  Mrs. Levine has done an admirable job, and I commend her for her efforts.	2002-11-25
