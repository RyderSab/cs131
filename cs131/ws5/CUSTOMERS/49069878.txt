Well, we all know that The Shadow knows - but now he has company.<BR>John Connolly's mystery / horror yarns demonstrate a willingness to plumb the depths to which mankind can descend.<BR>His protagonist, Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker, is a weary innocent, a flawed man of honesty and integrity who is capable of enormous violence. In the first of Mr. Connolly's books, \\"Every Dead Thing,\\" Parker's wife and daughter are murdered ritualistically and bloodily. Parker, an ex-cop who has up until that moment fought a losing battle with booze, stumbles into an appalling morass of evil. The tale is continued in this volume, and in his subsequent works. (Works which are available in New Zealand. Why they should be published here before an American release one can only wonder at).<BR>Parker's encounters with the foulness others are capable of is reminiscent of Dennis Lehane's stunning novels, with an added \\"supernatural\\" content. Mr Connolly's skills are such that talk of ghosts and talking-with-the-dead seems not only believeable, but expected, even to a hardened sceptic such as myself.<BR>If you like a good thriller, you'll read John Connolly. If you like a good horror story, then John Connolly's your man. For a good murder, John Connolly's hard to go past. He even throws in a gentle love story. Dense with plot, sub-plot, and a plenitude of excellent literary devices, this book, its predecessor and following volumes are masterfully crafted, and a delight to read.	2002-05-23

The 18th Richard Sharpe book from the author I'm almost compulsive about. <br />Bernard Cornwell appeals to me the way the writers of the Boy's Own yarns appealed to me when I was a boy, in the 1950s. His tales are filled with derring-do, with people battling not only an implacable foe but also their own demons - and doing it all so wonderfully well.<br />Like a number of Amazon reviewers, I have read all the Sharpe books, and they all grace my bookshelves (with the exception of two, which are on loan). This is a worthy addition to the continuing saga.. and one in which Mr Cornwell allows his sense of humour to show. <br />He very gently, and very skillfully, pokes the borax at the Danes in this book, and his wit is as sharp as Richard's bayonet. Read the story for the adventure (and it's a rattling good yarn about a little-known time of shame for the Brits)and for the gentle japes Mr Cornwell makes at the expense of the Danes' extraordinary reputation for being nice. <br />And we also see that while Sharpe displays some traits of true nobility, he is also a gutter-raised bloody-minded murderer. This almost schizoid characterisation is difficult for an author to maintain, but Mr Cornwell manages to tweak the sympathies of his audience well enough that we are tempted to forgive Sharpe anything. And, we do.<br />Will there be a 19th volume of Sharpe adventures? I certainly hope so.	2002-04-12

It is neither an easy nor a comfortable read. But it is an extremely good read.

Yes, it's unfortunate that Western Society ( and I am a 50 year old veteran of that society) has become so fixated on instant gratification - because that's not what you get when you read Nelson Demille. <BR>My bookshelf has every book - bar one - of Mr Demille's (since \\"By The Rivers of Babylon\\" anyway; I understand he wrote a couple of potboilers featuring a hard-bitten Noo York cop a million or two years ago ) and they are all well-thumbed, and re-read. The missing one is \\"Word of Honour\\" which has once again gone AWOL. This'll be the 7th copy I've loaned out. I will buy an 8th.<BR>Nelson Demille has had only one minor hiccup in his career, and that was \\"Lion's Game.\\" Which is not to say I didn't enjoy it; I did, and have, as I said, re-read it a number of times. It's simply a book that could have been written by someone else.<BR>\\"Up Country\\" is, however, vintage Demille. It is dense with detail, with a richness of language that ably demonstrates that the author holds his audience in the highest esteem. Paul Brenner, the protagonist of the story, is affable, easy to like, unflappable, erudite, witty, charmingly sarcastic, and - at times - a royal pain in the [rear-end]. But, we knew that. We had met him before, in \\"A General's Daughter,\\" the book which was turned into a half-decent movie, starring John Travolta. <BR>Other reviewers have claimed or complained that this book is a travelogue. If it is, the terrain which is visited is not modern day Viet nam (surely an oxymoron0 but the mud, dust, and blood-stained canyons of Brenner's (read Demille's) mind. This is a haunting memoir, dressed up in the trappings of a murder mystery. And it is also a timely warning to us all that we in the free West must not take our freedom for granted; we must be ever vigilant against those to whom we have given power from abusing that power.<BR>Unlike Tom Clancy's last turgid offering, a book which was at least 400 pages too long, \\"Up Country\\" is a splendid story, told alarmingly well. And, with Demille now taking his characters beyond the first book, I must admit that I am starting to wonder what ever happened to Keith Landry and Ann, or, indeed, Ben Tyson - although I suspect we have, in this book, also heard from Tyson.	2002-03-08

I own all the Sharpe books - including Trafalgar. <br />Sharpe's Gold is right up there with the best of the series. It's a rollicking Boy's Own yarn, a swasher of buckles, a putter-downer of foes, a sweeper-away of tempestuous heroines. It's fun, and makes no pretence to be otherwise.<br />Bernard Cornwell rarely writes badly (I disliked his Starbuck / Civil War stories, but that's me) and he doesn't let his fans down with this book. <br />Wellington's army is backed into a corner, and broke. The Spaniards have a lot of gold, and Sharpe's just the man to steal - er, appropriate it. That he has to blow up a city to do it is just another day in this larger-than-life, ultimately pragmatic soldier's life.<br />And yes - there's a great love story, too. <br />If, in reality, Wellington had had a Sharpe or two under his command, Napoleon would have gone back to Corsica to study pre-revolutionary tatting. Fortunately, he didn't... which means  there are plenty of more opportunities for Sharpe to battle his way across Spain and into France.	2001-03-07

An ex-Deputy Sheriff, he knows what he's writing about - and he writes very well, indeed.<br />This is a police procedure book that stacks up against the best of Ed McBain. Told in the first person, the story rattles along at a good pace, never dull, and always giving the reader that delicious thrill of another twist being just over the next page.<br />The reader will warm to the hero immediately: he's all too real. A heavy smoker, a heavy eater, a man who's definitely not cast in the Hollywood hero role. He's a little more than Mr Average - he's very bright, very quick - but not a man of great ambition. In short - a hero we can all relate to.  It's not until we get two-thirds through the book that we also realise he's middle-aged, with a daughter on college. His home life is chaotic, as he's a night-shift worker, and the very suburban dialogue he shares with his wife is witness, again, to his reality, and to the fact that his feet are planted firmly in the rich Iowan loam.<br />The murders are, at first glance, Satanic in origin. I was, at first, sceptical that this storyline could be maintained: Fox Mulder aside, there are very few satanic murders anywhere in the world. However, the story is not only sustained, but made believable by the developments.<br />If you like a good cop book, then try this out. The chances are excellent that you'll enjoy it.	2001-03-07

Sharpe's exploits on the Iberian Peninsula rank alongside those of Horatio Hornblower at sea - except that Bernard Cornwell's writing style is probably more accessible for the modern reader.<br />The Sharpe stories follow the exploits of a poor officer in the British army as it battles Napoleon's Marshals in Portugal and Spain. Badajoz was a pivotal battle in the campaign, and the seige was a masterpiece of engineering, and a triumph of courage and spirit.<br />Naturally, Sharpe is in the thick of things, battling not only the French, but his enemies in red jackets: the malicious Hakeswill being chief amongst them. <br />But Sharpe, and his ever-trustworthy partner, the huge Irishman Harper, fight through one of the grimmest descriptions of a battle you're ever likely to read.<br />A great episode in the lives of Richard Sharpe, Patrick Harper - and the man who relies so much on them: Arthur Wellesly, the Duke of Wellington.	2001-03-07

James Lee Burke's creation, Dave Robicheaux, is a perfect Everyman. He struggles with demons - his own, and those of others. He is an excellently flawed man, a man of great strengths, towering weaknesses, and deep melancholy: his humanity bleeds from evgery page.<br />In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead gives us a better, and deeper, insight into Burke's Everyman. The story purports to be a mystery / thriller, and is designated as such by Amazon.  It is, of course, much more, and much less, than that. The mystery is satisfying, of course. Mr. Burke doesn't know how to write a bad mystery. But it's a side-bar to what the book really is: a series of character studies. There's Robicheaux, of course. The story is told in the first person, so the reader is swept into his psyche from the first page. There's Bootsie and Alafair, the people closest to Robicheaux - and the people he often feels are the furthest from him. There's Clete Purcell, his psychotic, sweaty, shambling drunken hulk of a partner. There are the figures from his past, who return to haunt him. And there is, of course, the ghost of the Confederate General with whome Robicheaux confers, and exposes not only himself, but the entire landscape of characters.<br />Speaking of which - the Louisiana landscape is as much a character as any of the others. The dust, the heat, the colours, the odours, the taste of the land play as large a part as any human in the book.<br />Mr Burke has been writing the best prose in popular American fiction for the past ten years, if not longer. He has always been a superb writer, making every word perform well above its potential. And in this book, In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead, he has written one of his finest works.	2001-03-07

James Patterson - perhaps one-third of a broken piece of a potato chip? <br />Bernard Cornwell: a hearty meat and potato read; something that sticks to the ribs.<br />The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon: a superb five course gourmet meal, with more trimmings than a festive turkey.<br />Let's start with the hors d'oeuvres. Tapas, I think: varied, sharp. And that's Zimler's writing - fine, scalpel-sharp. This book is a pleasure to read, and would be even if it was a treatise on suet making. Zimler is an elegant writer. Bravo!<br />Then the soup. Ah, yes: a hearty beef broth, rich and satisfying... these are the characters. Each one lives on the pages, and makes him or herself known to the reader in a multi-layered, many-faceted way. The characters peopling this book are real.<br />Main course - An exquisite Paella (OK. I know I'm in Spain with the meal, rather than Portugal, but there is a fair bit of cross-over. Thanks for the lee-way.) Something that's complex, yet simple. Something with a number of ingredients, held together with one main theme. That's the Kabbalist's plot. A joy to read, a pleasure to experience.<br />Dessert is a light sorbet.. and that's the physical feel of the book. My edition is beautifully bound, and simply feels good in the hand.<br />Port and cigars, anyone? Because this is a meal which will last. I read The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon nearly a year ago - and every now and then the sting of Lisbon's dust and smoke invades my nostrils, and reminds me that I have enjoyed a sumptuous meal... and truly memorable book.<br />Thankyou, Mr Zimler.	2001-01-10

The first three books in a quatrain that leads us on an ever expanding journey into the smallest parts of ourselves. This a a set of books which are related in terms of plot / storyline / characters, but which are also widely disparate in the ways they examine those self same elements.<br />To suggest that Endymion is weaker or stronger than Hyperion is to confuse the issue. Endymion is as much a part of Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion as they are of it. Endymion is not a separate entity. It is a part of a sum which is greater than its parts.<br />I'm afraid that Mr Simmons is very quickly becoming guilty of committing literature.

This is the last taste of India in the Sharpe series... and it's a cracker read.<br />An avowed fan of the Sharpe yarns in the Peninsula war, I was a little dubious about going back in time. Sharpe's character had been developed over a long time, and to now go back to a time before he was initially created struck me as being fraught with peril.<br />I need not have worried. Bernard Cornwell is a consumate author, and has not put a step wrong. The young Sharpe is quick, dazzling, simple, immature: all the things we knew he had to have been, from his Napoleonic exploits.<br />Sharpe's Fortress sees Sharpe as an Ensign, having finally performed that deed of outstanding bravery Sharpe fans knew so much - and so little! - about. His struggles with the class / Army structures are well told, and the malevolent Hakeswill continues his plottings. (It's actually rather satisfying reading about Hakeswill, knowing how he's going to end up....) Once again, Sharpe has enemies on every side, and must overcome great odds in order to curry favour with his fellow-officers and the men he leads.<br />The Sharpe in India stories aren't as satisfying for me as the others, but that is purely because I have read a lot more about the Peninsula War than the Indian campaigns.  Nonetheless, they are rattling good yarns.. and, as ever, Bernard Cornwell gives us the best battle scenes in town.<br />Viva Sharpe!	2001-01-02

I read the blurb on the back, and thought I'd be reading a Patricia Cornwell / Scarpetta copycat.<br />I read the book, and I knew that to compare Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta with Kathy Reichs' Tempe Brennan is like comparing apples with oranges.<br />Both authors use the first person style of writing, both authors' characters are female, both authors' female characters have an awful lot to do with the slicing and dicing of dead folk. There the resemblance ends. Tempe, thank goodness, doesn't do things &quot;nicely&quot;, as Scarpetta constantly tells us she does.<br />Enough on the needless comparison.<br />Deja Dead is an extraordinarily good read. Tempe's a recovering alcoholic (her full name, Temperance, is superb.) She's a hugely intelligent woman who is not afraid to let her feelings show. Like us, she has weaknesses, foibles, and the occasional pimple on her backside. The story she tells is gripping, suspenseful, and leads the reader into a few disturbing back-alleyways of the mind.<br />Tempe (just how do you pronounce the abbreviation of her name?) is convincing, and will, I am sure, become a favourite on my bookshelves - just as Scarpetta is. <br />Buy this book expecting to have your partner try to swipe it off you before you've finished it. Expect be well entertained, and to have a few chills runing up and down your spine. <br />Don't buy it expecting another Scarpetta. Won't happen. Chalk and cheese. Apples and oranges.

It is a story which remains vivid in my mind, a glistening pearl shining amond the pebbles.<br />It is much the same with &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;. One can only marvel at Guterson. He has chosen each word with exquisite care, gently and lovingly placing it into the sentence so that it almost shouts for joy that it is in absolutely the right place.<br />It can be argued that writing is a craft, much like brick-laying. A mis-placed brick in a wall stands out like the proverbial canine testes: a badly placed word will do the same. The majority of popular authors are skilled craftsmen, making each word count. Guterson, however, takes writing to another plane. Each sentence is water to a thirsty man. The sum of each paragraph is equal to more than its parts. He is as far removed from the craft of writing as Michelangelo was from the craft of quarrying.<br />I feel that, should Guterson ever choose, he could write a VCR or DVD instruiction manual and not only make it comprehensible, but also make it elegant.<br />When you read the book - for read it you must - you will be entranced by the story, and the characters' moral dilemmas, and  all-too-human foibles, fears, and frustrations. <br />But mostly you will be warmed by the words. You will find yourself returning to the book time and again, simply for the pleasure of a perfect phrase, a sublime sentence. <br />This is what writing should be, and seldom is.

There are a few of the Sharpe books a fan would consider as being the best of the best: this is one of them.<br />On only (I think) three occasions does Sharpe fight a battle which doesn't appear in the history books: a completely imaginary conflict which cannot rely on any preconceived notions of &quot;how it really went&quot;.<br />And Cornwell does it brilliantly. He takes Sharpe out of our comfort zone - away from his beloved Riflemen - and pops him into a no-win situation.<br />Ducos is weaving his dangerous plots, the Royal Navy is represented by a money-hungry imcompetent coward, Harper has his six-barreled gun, there are Royal Marines, a thousand or so French troops, American privateers, and a decrepit fort set against a dangerous coast.<br />What more could you want?<br />Oh, yes: a battle.

And the wonderful thing is... we know he's going to escape, even though the odds are insurmountable.<br />There's a cliche seen all-too-often on the back of books: usually written by Clive Cussler, the words are &quot;A roller-coaster ride! (Insert another author's name here) look out - you've got serious competition!&quot;<br />Well, it's a description that tells part of the tale. Once again, Cornwell delivers more than just a great, rollicking adventure. He tells a complex story which exposes more of Sharpe's ambitions, dreams, and fears. <br />All of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books are good. Some are very good. And there are three which are simply superb: this is one of them.	2000-10-09

It's early Hunter, and it was the book which created his legions of fans.<br />Fine storytelling, with a taut, credible plot, and good characterisation - that's &quot;The Master Sniper&quot;.  It's the basic chase story, using the Second World War as a back-drop, with an extraodinary man cast as the villain, and good ol' Joe Average as the good guy.<br />History tells us that it was good ol' Joe Average ( a pretty amazing man ) who won the war in the Pacific and West Europe. And Hunter draws him here with sympathy and clarity.<br />This is a very, very good book: but Hunter got better with his next book, then better with the next one, and so on.

A personal note: the last time I directed a play, I started by reading the opening paragraph of &quot;Dirty White Boys&quot; to the cast. I told them that I wanted the opening of the play to be as powerful as the opening of this exceptionally good book. <br />Even if he never writes anything else, Stephen Hunter will be well satisfied with the fact that he has written the perfect opening to a book. In those twenty-some lines, I learnt all about Lamar Pye, and what makes him tick.<br />What comes after is just as powerful: a beautifully crafted story, moving swiftly from one intense point of interest and drama to another. Nowhere is there a false note: the people who populate these pages are vivid, understandable, and real. It's a story of the loyalty of a man who would be called crazed and evil by society, as well as being a story of betrayal by people we would be proud to call neighbour. <br />I am a major Stephen Hunter fan. (I even log on to find his movie reviews at the Washinton Post site). He is a major power in popular American writing. Ignore him at your peril: I would siggest that, as time goes by, his stories of the tough, uncompromising men and women of the U.S.A's south west will be considered classics.<br />&quot;Dirty White Boys&quot; is his best book so far. But any book of his will be worth three times the purchase price. And here's the kicker: Hollywood will leave it alone. It doesn't have a Hollywood ending - and, anyway, the story's just too big for Hollywood's usually pallid and thin canvas. Nonetheless, it'd make a brilliant film. Who's gonna do it for us?	2000-10-04

Dastardly Dan being chased by Dudley Do-Good. The blood flows faster than the Colorado River, and in quantities which make even that roaring river seem like a dry creek bed.

But Richard Gere as Marty Vail?? No way! <br />If you've seen the movie but not read the book, then pick it up and devour it. The film was... OK. People I know who haven't read the book say the flick's fabulous. But the book's so much better. The plot is so much richer, and the court-room scenes would have Grisham wishing he could write half as convincingly. Good gore, good psychology (whether it's accurate is another matter.

Christian Hatcher is the strong, silent type who is also a gentle, caring lover. He's a fairly simple - even gullible - character, driven for most of his life by other people's ambitions and machinations, but finally starting to realise his own value to himself.<br />Nonetheless, he is set on an adventure by the one person he really wants to see either dead, or in jail: the self-same man who framed nhim and sent him to Lops Boxes.<br />But who is manipulating whom? The plot thickens. There's a man-eating tiger, there are scenes of insane barbarity and passages of tender intimacy. <br />One note: you'll have to put yourself firmly into the '80s, when the action happens. <br />The plot, as I said, is convoluted, although based on a simple premise: Hatcher, a man wronged, is asked by his betrayer to find an old friend, the son of a respected, dying General.<br /> Great stuff. Another book I've stopped lending out...<br />First among equals? Yes. I've enjoyed all William Diehl's books - but this is his best, by a short whisker. Buy it. It's a great read.	2000-09-29

Marty Vail is a tough, pugnacious, witty, workaholic D.A. who used to be one of the most effective defending attorneys the world has ever seen - well, almost.<br />Aaron Stampler once pulled the wool over Vail's eyes, and the con affected him deeply: he became obsessed with not allowing any more guilty people to walk free amongst us.<br />But Stampler (surely one of the most satisfying bad guys ever created by an author - and that includes your friendly neighbourhood cannibal, Hannibal) didn't entirely walk free. He was sent to an asylum for the truly evil - and, after 10 years incarceration, it appears he is somehow managing to bump people off even while being locked up. I mean - being locked away in a high security bug-house is a fairly good alibi, wouldn't you think?<br />Vail and his team try to sort things out, in the midst of various day-to-day OJ-level cases. Vail finds that he's not so busy that he can't fall in love and enjoy a very healthy sex-life.<br />And Stampler? Well, he smiles his gentle little smile, and makes sure another body is found.. and another. Vail, meanwhile, is going nutso trying to pin the killings on a man in the bin.<br />The problem with a purely evil charcater is that they can seem a little one-dimensional, but Aaron is as skillfully written and developed as the Dark Knight's nemesis, The Joker. He's complex, works on many layers, and is as committed to following his own nasty little star as Vail is in stopping him.<br />The whole book works well. There are exciting courtroom and love scenes, the violence is played just right, the plot's intricate enough so you never get bored or bogged down. Diehl has, once again, done everything right. <br />It's a pity he didn't do the same for &quot;Reign In Hell,&quot; the third part of the trilogy. But hey - even the best of writers have a bad day. <br />&quot;Show Of Evil&quot; is amongst the best of its genre. You can, if you like, read &quot;Primal Fear&quot; first, but you don't have to. I'm also sure, dear (and hugely intelligent) reader, that you'll agree that casting Richard Gere as Marty Vail was a mistake.  <br />*Two bad puns in a six word sentence.

This was the first Clancy book I read (despite it having been published after &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;.<br />It's excellent.<br />It tells the story of World War Three in a way which makes sense of the Cold War. It tells the story of a truly global struggle (some of the action actually takes place in an tiny, insignificant part of the world little-known to U.S.A. and English writers: the Southern Hemisphere)from the perspectives of a few well-written and created characters.<br />Any war is difficult to dramatise, which is why many current writers tend to write more about the machines than the men who operate them - a trap Clancy himself has occasionally fallen into. But in this yarn, he blends the need for technical detail well with the desirability of telling the human story.<br />Of all Clancy's books, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Debt of Honour&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; are the best: and they're all, principally, people stories. <br />Mind you - whenever there's a new Clancy on the shelves, I buy it.

And it moves. The body count is awesome, the tension is overwhelming. The atmosphere is gritty, sweaty, saeamy. It's real. While it doesn't actually say so in the text, you know that Frank Hagan is a man who farts. He's human. He's damaged: a widower, still in love with his dead wife. He's... eccentric: a Londoner who drives a huge American car and plays 1950s rock and roll LOUD on the car stereo.<br />The story is a tad dated, but gripping nonetheless.

And all the preconceived notions I had about this book flew right out the window.<br />See - I thought it was going to be a cliche. And, in a number of ways, it is. But cliches wouldn't become cliches unless they were apt, pithy, easily understood, and fun. And that's &quot;Gideon&quot;.  <br />A complex plot, which is skillfully written to be easily understood. A Galahad-type hero, with the unattainable Lady Faire. A truly sinister set of evil-doers, who must be vanquished by their innocent foes. <br />This book has it all. And it delivers them with panache, style, wit, a certain tongue-in-cheekedness (!) and a joie de vivre that'll have you celebrating the fact that you've just read a damn' good story. <br />Excellent story-telling, well-crafted writing, heroes you'll root for, villains you'll love to hate. It's a conspiracy thriller, a political yarn, a story that Ludlum would have loved to write. Unfortunately, of course, Ludlum can't write, so he didn't. <br />Good yarn. Buy it.	2000-09-28

All Brown's heroic types are there: Mclanahan, Luger, etc. <br />The bad guys are all inherently unstable, and unable to think as clearly or as logically as the good ol' U.S. fly-boys. (And when I say enemies, I am not saying Brown's racist at all. Anyone who disagrees with Mclanahan &amp; Co. is an enemy - U.S. citizen, Korean politician, Red Chinese Minister... they're all enemies. This may hint of paranoia... but even paranoid people get killed.)<br />This book is Brown back doing what he does best: write about U.S. military aircraft and the folk who fly them into danger.  Brown's put together another unlikely scenario, made it feel real, and created high adventure out of it.<br />Good stuff. Long may Brown continue writing. Because while his books may have only the vaguest grasp of real-politik, they are bloody good fun.	2000-09-27

I was dining a few nights ago with - oddly enough - a German,an Englishman, and a Frenchman. <br />The topic came around to Waterloo. The Frenchman told the table that Napoleon didn't lose. He made a strategic defeat, and anyway it was the Prussians who won the battle. The German said the Prussians won the battle, and the French were beaten spitless. The Englishman said that Wellington and his army of scum won the battle, that Napoleon ran like a rabbit, and the Prussians arrived too late to do anybody any good. Before sabres were drawn, I poured another port and laid out an excellent Blue Vein cheese from New Zealand's Kapiti Coast.<br />No matter what Cornwell did with this Sharpe story, he was going to be in trouble. I loved the book. Great battle! It's hardly a Sharpe book at all: Sharpe's merely the device Cornwell uses to draw the battle together for the reader. <br />But Cornwell was always going to cop it in the neck from the Dutch (What? The Dutch run? Never! ) He was always going to be mocked by the Germans (Loiter on the way to a battle?  Nein! ). The French have never believed they lost the battle anyway, so Cornwell's version would have to wrong, wrong, wrong.<br />The book's an entertainment, so let's not get our knickers in a twist about &quot;the facts&quot;. It's Cornwell's view of the battle - accept that. And when you come to accept it as an entertainment, you'll enjoy it. This is battle on a huge scale - the largest number of men ever committed to battle at the time. And it's described expertly, with a feel for the blood, terror, glory, and unthinking heroism of the day. <br />Deeply satisfying, dramatic, gory - with a neat wrap-up for Sharpe's adulterous [...] ex.

I knowthat I'm going to be given an excellent read, and that, for a few hours, I will be transported to a world in which extraordinary people do extraordinary things with courage, brio, style, and, all too often, magnificent savagery.  <br />I've been disappointed a couple of times. The Starbuck stories left me a little cold - but even they give good battle.<br />So, it was with curiousity that I cracked &quot;Stonehenge&quot; open. A shade under five hours later, I closed the book, sighed deeply and happily, and decided to re-read it tomorrow. <br />[...] Cornwell describes a time when life was hard, brutal, and all too often short. It wasn't life that was cheap: it was death. Cornwell brings these days - or the version of those days that his fertile imagination sees - to vivid, smelly, rough life. The air reeked as much from magic, religion, and superstition (the same thing, usually) as it did from the character's own odour.  Magic was real to the people of Ratharryn - and because it was real, it worked. If a priest made a foaming-mouthed prohecy, it came true. The priest made sure of it. The societies are well-drawn, life in the hamelts and villages is extraordinarily well-described, the skirmishes and skull-cracking scraps are wincingly real.<br />Ultimately, though, this is the story of the people who built Stonehenge, why, and how. Cornwell's descriptions of the &quot;how&quot; are startling in their clarity. As a reader I could see and understand the construction methods, and believe that, given the appropriate amount of muscle-power, I could build another Henge. <br />The &quot;why&quot; must, of course, be pure speculation - and, like the magic, it becomes real because the writer and the reader wish it so.<br />And as for the &quot;who&quot;? Well, as ever, Bernard Cornwell excels in his characters. You'll not only like, love, or hate the various people who inhabit these pages so well, you'll come to understand them. <br />Collaborate with Cornwell as you read this book and you'll be taken on a journey of light and darkness, a journey which will stay with you far longer than that holiday you took as a youngster to Yellowstone, Blackpool, or Ayer's Rock.  <br />To Bernard Cornwell I offer, once again, my deep and sincere thanks for a book marvellously entertaining.

But  they're not worthy of Bernard Cornwell.  The problem really is Nate, the  lead character. Or maybe it's with me and my dear old dad: neither of us  can get a handle on him. Nate Starbuck's a ditherer who is also a fine  leader. He's certainly confused morally. His position as a Northerner in  the Southern armies wasn't all that unique as to raise as much rancour as  it does... <br />Not the best book Cornwell's written, by a long chalk.  There  are only two bright spots: the battle scenes, which are vintage Cornwell;  and I love the appearance of Sharpe's son. I'd love to know a lot more  about his adventures!<br />No - give the American Civil War / Starbuck series  the elbow, and write to Bernard Cornwell asking for more Sharpe. <br />Or  pretend to yourself that someone else wrote the book...

If you've read James Lee Burke's novels, then you're in for a more than  pleasant suprise with &quot;The Convict&quot;.

Comparing just one of these  stories with any of Burke's novels is like comparing whisky with strong  beer. <br />Each story is heady stuff - not only in the powerful way Burke  takes a word and wrings all the blood out of it onto the page before  setting it into place.  The stories are of strong-headed, often  wrong-headed men doing what they knew to be the best thing. They are tales  of the American South, of the bijoux days, of the days of sweat and  gunpowder and bowel-shaking fear.<br />These are tales Burke must have heard  as a boy, tales that have been purified in the distillery of Burke's mind  until all that's left is the gritty, sweaty essence.<br />And, at just a shade  over six bucks, these are cheap thrills, indeed.

Tyson is cuaght in a manifold dilemma: will his honour be impugned  if he should break his word, given freely to the men under his command?  Will his honour become besmirched if he breaks his word to his commanding  officers - and, by extension, his Commander In Chief and country? Will his  honour be dragged into the mire if he breaks his word, given with love and  hope for the future, to his wife?<br />Tyson, through deMille (or is it the  other way around?) deals with these questions, and more, in a scintillating  novel that will keep any reader with more than a hint of imagination not  merely entertained, but thinking, for long after they put the book  down.<br />Tyson's courage is on display on every page. His all-too human  weaknesses and foibles are laid bare, for all to see. His name, his  reputation, his courage, his honour are all threatened - but, in the end,  all Tyson has to redeem himself with is his honour.<br />&quot;Word of  Honour&quot; is an extraordinary novel. A story told with sympathy,  clarity, warmth, and humanity.<br />Or - is it an essay?	2000-09-19

Some, of  course, don't - Pamela Anderson's front-piece is a prime  example.<br />&quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; belongs to the former category.  &quot;Hyperion&quot; is gob-smackingly good. If you ain't read it, do so  now, or go to bed without any supper. Then, for a greater thrill, a greater  ride through the staggering reaches of a brilliant man;s imagination...  read &quot;The Fall Of Hyperion&quot;.<br />Dan Simmons is amazing. You don't  win that many awards unless you are. How many actors have won five, ten  Oscars? <br />Because Dan Simmons has won that many - or at least their  literary equivalents. Read &quot;Hyperion&quot; and its sequels, read  &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot;, read them all. And give thanks to your god  that people like Dan Simmons exist.	2000-09-17

This, I thought, was Demille's. The book is truly  superb.<br />Alas. I was wrong. For the second book you should reserve for  your unfortunate year of only two would be, must be, Demille's &quot;Gold  Coast&quot;.<br />And at the turn of the year grab &quot;Spencerville&quot;.  <br />This man is truly one of America's treasures. He understands irony,  pathos, man's inhumanity, man's humanity. He understands love, hate, the  loss of lifestyle, the renewal of life.<br />And he communicates them all with  wit, style, verve, subtlety, and a beautifully delicate touch of language  that on occasion you simply sit back in awe at a single sentence.<br />Nelson  Demille - I've had you as a welcome guest in my home for twenty years. I  hope and trust that you'll keep bringing me fresh joys for another twenty.	2000-09-17

This was the third or fourth Kellerman I read, so I was well acquainted  with Alex Delaware &amp; Co when I picked it up. I hadn't read the blurb -  I simply bought the book. Well, you do, don't you? especially when it's  Kellerman. Well, this was a pleasant surprise. I spent the first ten  minutes wondering what on earth I was doing in Jerusalem... and then I got  read the back cover.<br />Oh.<br />Sharavi wears his white hat comfortably. He  is a very satisfying character, rich in nuance, with a dry wit. He's a  character you're continually investigating throughout the book: Kellerman  has written him well enough that you're never really sure what makes  Sharavi tick.<br />Jerusalem is also well described. The dust, tension, angst,  and U.N. corruption are obviously known to the author. You can feel the  antiquity of the walls clashing with the pollution of the internal  combustion engine in his descriptive pieces.<br />This is a book which  deserves a second and third reading. It's one of Kellerman's best - which  means it's one of the best in my book collection.<br />By the way... my copy's  title is &quot;The Butcher's Theatre&quot;.  Wasn't it nice of the  publisher to provide an English translation?	2000-09-13

Richard Sapir, co-creator of the extraordinarily witty Destroyer series  (with Warren Murphy ) writes a book on his own... and it's a triumph!<br />A  story told from two perspectives - eye of God, and the main protagonist's  own point of view - The Far Arena tells the story of a champion Roman  Gladiator of the greatest &quot;bread and blood&quot; circus days who is  exiled, frozen to death, then revived in modern times. Forget the science,  although it reads well enough. Just suspend your disbelief, and read on,  because this is culture shock on a grand scale.<br />Eugenie tells his own  story of his triumphs in becoming Rome's richest Gladiator, his fall from  grace, his &quot;death&quot;, and resurrection. The contempt he holds for  modern man is palpable.  Throughout the book we are forced to question our  modern morals and ethics, our religions and beliefs.<br />If you spot this  book anywhere, grab it. Read it. Then mail it to me. I loaned my copy out,  and..... well, you know the rest of that story!	2000-09-13

I've been  slightly disappointed by one or two of his books (well - I would have given  a couple of the Delaware yarns only four stars...) and yes, I did feel that  Kellerman needed a break.<br />He took a break, and produced a book that  stands up with his &quot;Butcher's Theatre&quot; as his best.<br />Billy  Straight is told from a number of perspectives... but the young lad who  populates everyone's thoughts is definitely Kellerman's character  masterpiece. The murder / mystery story is almost incidental. I just wanted  Billy to find a way of loving himself. However, the crime is vital to the  raison d'etre of the book.. and, like all Kellerman crimes, is well thought  out, and baffling. The heroine is all-too-human, engaging, tenacious -  she'd be good to know. And the villains are expertly drawn - as appalling a  pair of dirt-bags you're never likely to meet.<br />And it was nice that  Delaware and Sturgiss got a mention at the end. <br />Viva la master!	2000-09-13

Well worth  the admission price.<br />The story is, as ever, complex. There are twists and  turns in Scarpetta's personal and professional life which leave the reader  wondering just how strong she has to be... then the character herself  breaks down in tears to let you know that even the toughest of Chief  Medical Examiners has a beart.<br />Mind you, as these books are written in  the first person, Scarpetta never fails to sieze an opportunity that she  &quot;kindly&quot; does something. No sooner done than said, eh old girl? A  picky thing, but it does irritate me.<br />Nonetheless, I have every Scarpetta  book. And I've read them all more than once.<br />Patricia Cornwell is a  stylish writer, her heroine is stylish, and by god she wields a Stryker saw  superbly.  If you like whodunnits, you'll love Scarpetta.<br />But don't read  &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. It's really, really awful.	2000-09-13

The criticism given by a couple of other reviewers is valid: it helps to  know Delaware, Robin, and Sturgiss from the previous novels. This book  doesn't add to their characters... it's not a &quot;growth experience&quot;  for them. <br />So - it's not the best of Kellerman's books, far from it. But  it's still a good, reliable read. And the evil that's done is quite, quite  satisfying. <br />Hey - it's the price of a movie ticket, and it took me more  than three hours to read.

A great way spend  a cold winter's afternoon. Justin Gilead is all that's good about America  and the East, and the bad hats are truly nasty. There's plenty of magic and  mystery.. and the chess games are as tense as they should be.

Thoroughly enjoyable, a good adventure based on all the old stories  and fables. It's a yarn that needed to be told (wasn't Arthur known as the  once and future king?) and Cochran and Murphy tell it well. <br />The sequel  will be interesting - a republican king? And what will Charles, Camilla,  Henry, and all that pasty-faced lot do?<br />Listen - if you have any interest  in the Arthurian stories, you'll have to read it, because it does add to  the lexicon.<br />But if you want something that tells what Arthur and Co.  might have really got up to, go to Amazon's Bernard Cornwell site, and buy  the Winter King series.

The first three Sharpe books cost me, in total, NZ$10. Around US$5. I have never seen Sharpe / Cornwell in a remnant or second-hand bookshop  since. And I gladly fork out my $ for the next new Sharpe. I have all of  them. Each one gets read once every two years. My wife thought I was a  lunatic - until I read &quot;Sharpe's Rifles&quot; aloud to her. Now, she's  read all my Sharpe books, and competes with me to get the newest and  latest. Incidentally - the trip back in time to India is superb! If you've  never read any of the series before, do start with Sharpe in India, then go  on to this one. It's simply a matter of chronology. I now have everything  Cornwell has written... including the unfortunate Starbuck Chronicles.  Three or four of the Sharpe TV series have screened here - but the dumbing  down of TV has meant that they were screened at a time when they were bound  to pick no viewers: 11.30pm. &quot;We had no viewers, therefore we shan't  buy the rest of the series..&quot; cried the dorks at the Channel  responsible.
