US	52562110	R75GLGUCEVKOK	0805063889	671016982	Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America	Books	2	16	20	N	N	Whiny and inaccurate	To see what conditions were like for women re-entering the workforce after years on welfare, the author went undercover as a divorcee with no job skills and worked menial jobs trying to make rent.  It was a great idea, and I was interested in her findings.  But they were presented in such a whiny, negative way that the only thing I was sure about was that I never wanted to employ Barbara Ehrenreich.<br />The first thing she tried was waitressing, an honest profession and one that probably half of all Americans have done at one time or another.  Her feet hurt, her back hurt, she couldn't keep up, her coworkers were mean to her, the customers didn't treat her like a real person.  She walked off the job in the middle of a busy day with no notice, in fact, she didn't even tell anyone that she had left.  On to housekeeping, which was much the same.  And finally, when she worked at Walmart, she was downright rude to customers and coworkers.  <br />I would have liked to have seen more numbers.  For example, it would have been nice to know what the author considered &quot;necessities&quot; to spend money on.  I had a hard time understanding why, when she was making $250/week, she had to take a second job to make rent on a $120/week hotel room (utilities included).  More documentation and figures might have made me more sympathetic.  It also would have been nice to simulate caring for a child on a low income; I had trouble understanding why a single person with no other responsibilities couldn't live cheap.<br />I didn't think this book fairly portrayed the lives of the working poor.  Like many readers, I spend several years working two part-time jobs at minimum wage with no benefits.  Somehow I managed to make ends meet without without becoming whiny and bitter.  I also never adopted an &quot;us against them&quot; mentality pitting myself against my &quot;wealthy&quot; customers, and I seldom saw this kind of bad attitude displayed by my fellow poverty-ridden coworkers.  Aperson's attitude is different when they don't have the luxury of walking off the job and returning to their &quot;real life&quot;.  <br />The book was interesting and I finished it.  However, it shouldn't be taken as fact.  To find out about the real lives of the real working poor (the ones who have to be poor for more than a month at a time), talk to your own neighborhood fast-food worker, waitress, or Walmart associate.	2001-11-16

Theyfind a big supply of cheese and start eating it.  When the cheese runs out, the two mice go and find more cheese while the two littlepeople whine about the lack of cheese.  Finally one of the littlepeople (GOOD littleperson) leaves to find more cheese and the other (BAD littleperson) stays and feels sorry for itself.  That's the story in a nutshell, and this paragraph is almost as long as the book is.  You can ponder this paragraph rather than buying the book and save yourself some money.<br />This was a Dr. Seuss book without all the rhymes.  It was a social commentary in parable form, just like Dr. Seuss.  There are multiple levels of understanding, just like Dr. Seuss.  But it's missing the well-written rhymes and the neat pictures (all we get is a picture of a cheese on every other page with the point of the page summarized in the picture so just in case we can't handle reading the story we can still understand the concept). You couldn't even enjoy it by reading it to your kids, like you would with Dr. Seuss, because your kids would be bored by the third page.<br />This was an adorable oversimplification of the need for change in the corporate world.  It's selling well because it's a quick read and it's just so cute (I need to be saying that in a high-pitched squeaky voice to get the point across).  It's something that lower-level managers and bottom-level employees are reading to make themselves feel better, while mid- to upper-level managers are reading real business books without pictures of cheese.<br />I can't recommend this book to anyone without laughing.  If you must read it, get it from a library but be sure you don't let anyone else see you reading it.  You'll be labeled as one of those &quot;cheese heads&quot; (that's what we call them in my office) and will have a hard time being taken seriously after that.	2000-08-25

Natalie owns a vineyard and has spent the  last 71 years of her life deeply involved with this vineyard, making  sacrifices and dealing with the toils and joys of farming life.  Olivia has  been hired to write Natalie's memoirs and to try to help Natalie's  children, Susanne and Greg, understand why their mother wants to get  married again after their father has been dead only six months.  There's  also a tall, dark, and handsome stranger (the vineyard manager) who is  going to play some part in Olivia's life in the upcoming months, but that's  to be expected of a Delinsky novel.<br />This book takes us deeply inside the  ups and downs of family life.  We get to see husbands and wives trying to  work things out, and we also see children learning to accept their mother.   Barbara Delinsky gives us a look into the heart of a family and brings new  meaning to the phrase &quot;blood is thicker than water.&quot;<br />This is a  relationship-driven book instead of a plot-driven book; the plot is  virtually nonexistent.  I felt like I knew the characters.  At the end of  the book I wanted to have a conversation with Natalie, and I also wanted to  see if Greg and Jill were able to work things out with their marriage.  The  book made me feel included in their lives.<br />I would recommend this book to  anyone who likes relationship novels and likes feeling included in a book.   I would also recommend it to people who like sweet (although gratuitous)  romance.	2000-08-23

Hal goes, gets chosen to participate, and even wins  a trip to England!  In the meantime, Arthur, a 10-year old kid in New York,  finds a small cup that makes him feel good.  But Arthur isn't the only one  interested in the cup, and soon he and his aunt find themselves running for  their lives.  This is an interesting new take on the old King Arthur legend  as legendary characters get reborn into modern society and must lead the  life they were born to live.  We also get new insights into the character  of Merlin, or Taliesin.<br />I thought this book was a lot of fun.  It  certainly wasn't serious fantasy, but the characters were interesting and  the plot was unique.  There was enough action to keep the book going, and  there was even one gratuitous sex scene to keep things interesting.  This  is a new story on an old theme and well worth reading.  I liked the sequel,  The Broken Sword, more than I liked this book but I thought they were both  fun.<br />I would recommend this book to any King Arthur fan, especially those  who would like to see a new and unique twist on the old myth.  I would also  recommend it to fans of urban fantasy, where characters here in our world  aren't always what they seem.	2000-08-23

When the assassin, Hugh the Hand,  is taken before the King, the King has an unusual request: he wants Hugh to  kill his ten-year-old son, Bane.  In the meantime, a group of dwarves  (Gegs) is starting to turn from their normally peaceful lifestyle to revolt  against the elves who have enslaved them for generations.  And in the midst  of all these subplots, we have two god-like representatives from ancient  races, sworn enemies, destined to meet again.  This all makes for an  excellent fantasy novel, especially when written by notable fantasy writers  like Weis and Hickman.<br />The storyline was my favorite part of this book.   The plots and subplots kept the book moving with hardly any downtime  between exciting events.  The book skipped back and forth between  characters enough to keep things interesting, but not enough that it was  jarring.  Although they were the usual fantasy characters, the  personalities and the interactions between them made the characters come  alive.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any epic fantasy  enthusiasts.  However, I believe people who don't normally read fantasy  would enjoy this book as well.  There's little violence and no sex, and I  think the subject matter is safe for kids.	2000-08-15
US	52562110	R2HAQTQXP35TRK	0684862719	925429454	PAY IT FORWARD: A Novel	Books	4	34	36	N	N	Inspiring	This story begins by introducing us to the main characters: Trevor, a  12-year old boy; Arlene, his recovering alcoholic mother; and Reuben, who  is a wounded Vietnam vet and Trevor's social studies teacher.  As an  extra-credit project, Reuben challenges his class to do something that  matters to the world and report on it.  While his classmates do predictable  projects like recycling, Trevor comes up with &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;, a  movement where he does momentous good deeds for three other people and in  return asks each of them to do something for three people, thus paying it  forward.  Trevor's classmates laugh at him, believing that it's in people's  nature to fail to follow through on the promise to pay it forward.  But the  movement begins to have terrific results on the world.<br />I liked the way  the book was written.  The author spoke from the point of view of all the  main characters and told the story through all of them.  The style had its  drawbacks: it was easy to get confused about which character was speaking.   But it worked for this book.<br />This isn't your ordinary feel-good Random  Acts of Kindness type of book.  This is a book about real people feeling  real pain who had their pain eased in very strange ways.  And it's about  people who wouldn't normally reach out to others, but they take the  challenge seriously.  In short, it's about you and me, and our neighbors,  friends, and coworkers, the people who aren't usually anxious to be  generous to strangers.  And it's about people like us doing better.<br />I  would recommend this book to people who need to read something  inspirational but find the Chicken Soup for the Soul stories cheesy.  I  would also recommend it to people who are looking for something larger than  themselves to devote their lives to.	2000-08-10
US	52562110	R1SJ60RSZ6UAPC	0671028030	817283792	Cat	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Not impressed	This book is about Cat, a troubled teenager, sharing her story of incest and other abuses to a group of other troubled teenagers.  Cat is whiny and  unbelievable, as are the rest of the girls in her group.  The book closes  with an aura of hopelessness: the world is a terrible place and it's never  going to get any better.<br />I used to like V.C. Andrews' books, but either  I've outgrown them or the new ghostwriter doesn't match up to Andrews'  original style.  This book is targeted towards teens but the subject matter  isn't appropriate.  I believe teenagers can handle difficult issues like  incest in mature ways, but this book seems to almost glorify it.	2000-08-02
US	52562110	R3C1FA1JEBHRAU	0812534077	513391749	Memory and Dream	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Intriguing	This book starts out with a chance meeting between Isabelle, an aspiring artist, and Rushkin, a famous painter.  Rushkin offers to take Isabelle on as a student and begins teaching her the finer points of his art.  As  Isabelle begins to discover, one of the finer points of Rushkin's art is  the ability to bring faerie creatures to life through the paintings.  These  creatures would &quot;cross over&quot; from &quot;the before&quot; to take  up real lives in Isabelle's world.  But soon after Isabelle discovers the  pleasure of bringing these creatures to life, she has to deal with the  grief of losing them because somebody is preying upon these faerie  creatures.  Isabelle must fight to save them from destruction.<br />This was  the first novel I've read by Charles de Lint and it certainly won't be the  last.  My favorite part of the book was the way everything was tied  together and chance encounters brought quick results.  It seemed like every  action of every character was somehow part of the big picture, and it tied  things up into a very neat little package.  I loved the interactions of the  characters, especially the faerie characters.  Every person seemed vibrant  and alive, like I could meet them outside of the book.<br />Although I don't  see this book as being one that epic fantasy readers would get excited  about (it was a relatively short book and not very deep) it might be good  for a break between epic novels.  I would definitely recommend it to people  who like light fantasy or people who enjoy books where our world collides  with a more mysterious one.	2000-07-31
US	52562110	R3HXT06LX8EWYG	031225234X	312924571	Name Dropping	Books	4	11	11	N	N	An entertaining light read	Name Dropping begins with two women, both named Nancy Stern, living in the same building.  One of the women interviews celebrities for a living and the other (our heroine) works at a preschool.  When the preschool-teaching  Nancy starts receiving invitations to parties with celebrities and phone  calls from strange men wanting to sleep with her, she knows there's been a  mix-up between the two Nancys.  Annoyed, our Nancy accepts a blind date  with a man who unintentionally called her while trying to reach the other  Nancy.  There's a murder and some missing jewels, and our Nancy has to try  to sort everything out.<br />I really liked the characters in the book.   Preschool-teacher Nancy was fun and believable, as was Bill (the blind date  she fell for).  Celebrity Nancy was easy to dislike.  The kids at the  preschool were entertaining as were the other teachers.  I read the book  quickly because I wanted to find out what happened to everyone.<br />While  this was by no means a literary masterpiece, the writing style was  enjoyable and easy to read.  I felt like I could relate to the people and  the surroundings even though I had never been in that particular situation.   The plots and subplots kept the book moving and there wasn't much lag time  between events.<br />I would recommend this book to people who enjoy  first-person, self-depracating novels about women who aren't gorgeous or  important.  I would also recommend it to people who like light mysteries  without much horror or blood.	2000-07-27
US	52562110	RY2Q7MNG98YUP	0312862830	198373503	The Broken Sword	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent even as a stand-alone novel	I didn't read The Forever King (yet), but I still really enjoyed this book.  I thought it was a stand-alone novel until I started looking for other books by the authors.<br />The book opens by introducing us to  characters that lived during the Middle Ages who have been reborn here in  the modern world.  Arthur is 13 years old, and he's being protected by Hal  (Galahad) and Taliesin.  They meet up with another young girl, Beatrice,  who was once the Innocent.  They're helped out by knights like Launcelot  and they're being chased by ancient enemies.  The story revolves around the  Holy Grail which takes the form of a cup with the power to heal.<br />I  thought this was a very creative take on the old King Arthur legend.  The  good characters are all very likeable and the bad characters are easy to  hate.  The fact that it was set in modern times made the characters easy to  relate to and gave freshness to the book.<br />Regardless of the number of  pages, this wasn't a very long read.  I read it in one sitting on an  airplane.  But it left a feeling of satisfaction.  I would recommend this  book to people who enjoy the legend of King Arthur but want to see  something different.  I would also recommend it to fantasy fans who like it  when the real world collides with the fantasy world.	2000-07-21

There are  letters, memos, and anecdotes about The Boo's relationship with others in  the school.<br />I found this to be an excellent portrayal of Citadel life.   We on the outside think of the cadets as stern and commanding, but this  book showed them being human.  It also showed the sense of humor that The  Boo had when dealing with the &quot;Lambs&quot; and the  &quot;Bums&quot;.<br />I found this book to be especially interesting after  reading Lords of Discipline because I could see how autobiographical that  novel was.  Many of the experiences the characters had in Lords of  Discipline came from acual experiences the cadets had in the Citadel.<br />I  would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Conroy's work, especially  Lords of Discipline.  I liked the insights I got into his character.	2000-07-11

The characters are mostly stereotypes.  We have Kate, the family therapist, whose own family is falling apart and who is considering an affair with an old high  school flame.  She has two teenage daughters, one rebellious and one  &quot;perfect&quot;, and a withdrawn husband.  Add her wayward sister, Jo  Lynn, and her aging mother, and you have one of the typical prototypes of a  book family.<br />The novel starts as Jo Lynn, who's been married several  times to abusive men, decides she wants to marry a man on trial for the  murder of thirteen women.  She decides to marry him after seeing his  picture in the paper and deciding he was good-looking.  To Kate's dismay,  Jo Lynn also manages to drag Kate's rebellious daughter into the situation.   At the same time, Kate's mother starts showing signs of Alzheimer's  disease and Kate has to deal with that with no help from Jo Lynn and little  help from her distant husband.  Kate's old boyfriend also shows up in town  and starts making advances.<br />There are several little character  interactions that keep the book going.  Kate's got a lot on her mind, so  the book doesn't spend a lot of time on one problem before looking at a  different problem.  The characters, though stereotypical, are  three-dimensional and interesting.  The plot line isn't outstanding but it  isn't bad either.  Everything leads up to a predictable (and satisfying)  conclusion.<br />I would recommend this book to someone who didn't want to  read anything heavy, just something light that they wouldn't have to think  about after finishing it.	2000-07-03

She talks about the kids individually, the problems they had to face being homeless and the joys when she made a  breakthrough.  It was a lesson on hope and defiance of the odds.  I found  it especially touching when Karl Malone, a basketball player for the Utah  Jazz, took the homeless students Christmas shopping and took them to a Jazz  game.  I found this to be a wonderful portrayal of the joys and trials of  teaching homeless kids.	2000-06-01

I don't usually read romance novels because they're all the same: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  Usually the girl is weak and has no personality.   Katherine Myers breaks this mold in Ribbons of Silver.  The woman, Kenna,  is three-dimensional, strong, and very likable.  The love story between her  and Grey is passionate and realistic.  The book had a great plot and wasn't  just a background to the romance.  I've read all of Katherine Myers' books  and enjoyed them, but this was my favorite.	2000-05-31

But I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  This was cleverly written, and I enjoyed the blonde jokes.  I don't like the way most romances portray  women as helpless and pitiful and men as distant and controlling.  This  book broke away from those stereotypes and gave me a hero and heroine that  I could empathize with.  I could have lived without all the sex, but I  guess that's just part of the genre.  I found the book light and easy to  read.	1999-12-05

It seemed more like adult contemporary fiction, the kind of thing you hear on Oprah.  The first story was great, but it all went downhill  from there.  The first story was the only one that had a  &quot;boogeyman&quot; or any element of the supernatural.

I finally picked it up, and I never put it down again until I finished it.  Completely engrossing, a page-turner.	1999-09-09

At first I really liked the main character, Jewel, but in the end I didn't like her anymore.  The book was worthwhile.	1999-09-09
