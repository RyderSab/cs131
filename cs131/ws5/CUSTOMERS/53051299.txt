US	53051299	R1MWL0AWYKVF5J	0060792175	420660459	Everything Is Illuminated	Books	3	8	9	N	Y	Good first novel	The extravagant hype surrounding Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel serves only to create a camouflage of unreasonable expectations and subverts an extremely promising career beginning, a promise left as yet unfulfilled. Like Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" (but without her degree of tonal control), Mr. Foer writes beyond our expectations of one so young, and ambitiously, with humour and humanity.    The novel, however, is wildly uneven, veering between cut-rate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, abbreviated William Styron and a witty lyricism all his own. The stabs at humour frequently become repetitious or fall flat and his experimental narrative constructions are only intermittently successful as well.    But he gets full marks for effort and, when his writing works, as it frequently does, it is a joy to read. So if \\"Everything\\" is approached ignoring the hype, it has enough delights to reward your effort.	2005-09-23

The role ruins play in the imaginative life of European culture: a reflection on mortality and the transience of civilizations, among other interpretations. Modeled after \\"The Haunts of the Black Masseur\\" it is often fascinating, consistently well-written but on occasion seemed to go on too long. The last chapter was the most moving as the personal histories seemed the most tragic and affecting. An intriguing cultural history, as told by an obsessed historian as a labor of love.	2005-08-15

His metaphoric precision, his moral rigor, his exacting standards of literary excellence, his humanistic compassion dwarfs all competitors for the title. One would have to revert to Lionel Trilling, Edmund Wilson and Alfred Kazin to find comparable peers and, except perhaps for Trilling, I feel he outshines them all. Luckily we are not reduced to reading only one writer for insight and thoughtful exploration of literature's richness and follies. But in this, his newest volume of essays, he demonstrates once again why his writing remains indispensible.	2005-07-09

Boswell and Samuel Johnson are brought into court as co-defendents, along with Kitty Kelly and a host of others. The author has no kind words to say for \\"critics and reviewers\\", clearly to him the vermin of the literary world, and feels much aggrieved by his unjust treatment at their hands. <br /> <br />While one may be less than convinced by his arguments, and be irritated by his frequent whining of being much put upon, his chatty tone, wealth of biographical lore and surprising revelations about the biographer's trade make this in the end a very worthwhile read.	2005-06-10

Currently, and not surprisingly perhaps, it carries a very post-9/11 feel. This is a story of gradually mounting terror and the panic that ensues, triggered by an incident whose momentous import is unappreciated initially. The world changes and the previous age's complacency can never be retrieved.<br /><br />Wells's ability to capture a believable human response to an unbelievable occurence is what keeps the story grounded and genuinely frightening. This edition, illustrated by one of the great masters of the mischieviously macabre, is one to savour in these unsettling times.	2005-05-18

The author's iconoclastic approach is refreshing and he veers neither to the left nor the right in his efforts to set the record straight. The opening chapters are the most helpful in giving a fairly strict chronologic narrative while the latter chapters expand on certain themes previously touched on. Unfortunately much of the writing is rather dry and occasionally bogs down into lists of names and dates. The author peppers his text with ironic comments that could have enlivened it if used more liberally. The last chapter, that brings the political uses of the legacy of the Crusades up to the present, is actually the best in the book. As mentioned in my title, a good overview.	2005-04-29

This one, two essays ostensibly on the Iliad by Simone Weil and Rachel Bespaloff, attains the very special pantheon of a glorious literary event. <br /> <br />Both pieces were written by women who were Jewish intellectuals forced to flee France on the cusp of the Second World War and were composed in that climate of national upheaval. In writing about the greatest war epic in Western literature, they were able-each in her own way-to cast a reflection on her own time and the devasting changes that the threat of war was effecting. Needless to say, this creates an urgency and immediacy to their writing that goes beyond the literary. These are not aloof reflections on an ancient relic but the purest example of writing on life and death as a matter of life and death. <br /> <br />The publishing of the the pairing of these two pieces is an act of heroic recovery, the best example of why writing matters.	2005-03-26

Lovecraft: Tales (Library of America)	Books	5	107	132	N	Y	Nightmare masterpieces	It is best to first read Lovecraft when young; after all, he mainly wrote for the horror pulps which had a large (predominantly?) immature readership. At that time in one's life, vocabulary and phrases such as \\"eldrich\\", \\"ichor\\", \\"the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation\\" seem perfectly appropriate. It is only when one is an adult that his endless litanies of attempts to describe the indescribable starts to seem more than a little over-the-top. His most powerful stories remain those wherein he merely makes a few choice suggestive phrases, such as Arch Obler did in his radio show \\"Lights Out\\"-trusting that the imagination is better at supplying the grisly details than any catalogue of gorey descriptors.    What remains for the adult reader who chooses not to prematurely dismiss Lovecraft's purple passages is an imagination that remains unsurpassed in tapping into the nightmare realm of the subconcious. The darkside of the dreamlife, reminiscent of the \\"Black\\" paintings of Goya, are conjured on the page with an obsessive richness that one would have to go back to Poe to find the equal. And Lovecraft is willing to go beyond Poe's gothic to a mythic cosmology that opens up from the claustrophobic dimensions of a tomb to a supradimensional realm of monstrous gods.    My favorite Lovecraft stories are all included here in this beautifully bound compilation: \\"Pickman's Model\\", \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\" and my initial introduction to his work, \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" (which resulted in an excessive expenditure of wattage for the subsequently imperative nightlight).    If approached with an open mind, these tales will haunt your dreams,too.	2005-02-16

The explanation is so verbose and unnecessarily detailed for the function of plot alone that it purposefully strays into philosophy and how we perceive the world and interact with others. Insightful aphorisms dot the narration. The major fault I find with novels of this sort (and I believe many of the European writers are kin, like Kundera and Calvino) is that they fail to tie their mechanical plot symmetries to lifelike characters. Instead their characters talk in robotlike voices, vaguely imitating real people without the unique inflections of lifelike individuals. These authors have the imagination but not the mimetic skill to make fiction come to life. So reading them is like watching a puppet play, interesting for the plot convolutions but ultimately emotionally detached.	2004-12-31

The author clearly knows not only his material but is a valuable resource for all the other major writing on the subject and generously points the reader in other directions when relevant. Adding to the pleaure of reading this concise summary of vast amounts of historical information is a witty style that entertains as it instructs. The only complaints I have refer to frequent Latin phrases that are infrequently decoded and an occasional presumption of theological concepts that are foreign to the non-Christian (i.e. myself). Also sometimes the brevity leave gaping questions (e.g. when Calvin was made unwanted in Geneva, why was he called back?). Nonetheless, this is a fascinating, engaging work.	2004-12-29

It probably seemed as good editorial justification for compiling these literary biographical essays as any, as they were clearly written for very different purposes over the years. <br /> <br />But getting beyond that minor critique, the collection is uniformly entertaining, informative and well-written. Allen is an opinionated and witty critic, and is not shy about taking on others in the field (e.g. Joyce Carol Oates in one essay). And while this book may act as a pleasant intro to the authors discussed, it rarely scales the heights of either profundity or dazzling insight which someone like James Wood can provide. Anyone superficially familiar with many of these writers will find themselves trodding familiar ground. For the novice, however, they are a very good place to start. <br /> <br />	2004-11-02

For those who argue there is no concrete utility in reading and are satisfied that future generations are losing this habit, this book is the best argument to the contrary I know. Not that there is any solemnity to his story or any self-importance. His is a wry, affectionate tale of growing up in the straight-laced Midwest in the 50's.

Intermittently she would illuminate an author I knew little about in a way that made me want to know more. Those authors I was familiar with, however, were often analyzed in rather unoriginal ways using the most familiar facts or quotes. The most irritating thing about her essays was her style of writing. <br />  <br /> Her syntax is often idiosyncratic and her metaphors either missed or pushed to absurd limits (&quot;In this field study, each new digger will need to explore the previously looted pharaonic tombs in search of an overlooked jewel in the stone eyes prepared for eternity&quot; (p.205) referring to a biography by Jeffrey Meyer. Whew!). She will compile lists of nouns without clarifying the point of such a list or what the nouns are suppose to refer to. Some sentences just remain mystifyingly opaque (&quot;The zest and jest are embraced, perhaps too lovingly. The manner itself is the intention, and the ear is bookish and rather overwhelming&quot;). (p.91) All this gets rather exhausting for pages at a time. <br />  <br /> Nonetheless, her appreciation of her chosen writers is always evident, even when they come under her benignly critical eye and her personal knowledge of some of these people is enlightening.

Seligman clearly relishes the opportunity to talk back to Sontag, especially for the ways she has enraged him over the years, but he just as clearly admires her as well.<br />Critics who review this book are participating in a real pomo experience: critiquing a critic who is not only criticizing two critics but the critics of those critics as well (follow? no matter).

I mean this in a good way. He is the supreme irritant, harsh, given to extreme negative appraisals with little if any nuance in his ultimate judgments. The nuance comes in his explanations of his viewpoint, which are often extremely well argued and based on broad if not always deep reading of the subject or author at hand. What he lacks in charity he makes up in uncompromising standards, at the risk of unpopularity (an accomplishment I'd safely say he has achieved).<br />Which is not to say that he is always right or just. His misreading of &quot;American Pastoral&quot; is so bizarre it almost seems he was determined not to like it and willfully chose to distort what the book was about. How this usually perceptive critic could be so off the mark makes me feel, perhaps mistakenly, that he has some personal animus with Roth that has nothing to do with the novel being reviewed. Either that, or he takes such issue with Roth's ideas that he expresses his opposition in his criticism of Roth's prose.<br />What is also unfortunate is Peck's inability to restrain from being caustic without explanation, as if a negative response is the only rational one. I am referring to his inexplicable outburst against Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, AS Byatt et al in his essay on Julian Barnes. Such writing backfires on Peck and makes him seem...well, peckish.<br />At this point, I would love to read some criticism by him about something he actually likes. Negative review after negative review creates the impression of someone for whom the proverbial cup is always half empty and I, for one, would love to see him share some of his enthusiams (providing they exist, that is). For someone who thinks so hard about literature, such a book would probably be a joy to read.	2004-06-09

And in great part it met these expectations.<br />More than anything else, this is a work of love, being the excavation of forgotten facts in the history of gay life as it was lived by decades of gay men, experiences now mostly forgotten or scattered in obscure and fading documents. It is an extraordinary work of social archeology, resurrecting a world I never knew exisited. And Chauncey does this in exceptional detail, using clear prose, so that by the end the geography of this world has been salvaged and reconstructed, like Combray from Marcel's teacup.<br />As the book proceeds, the writing becomes stronger, particularly as the facts become more readily available, and the arguments and conclusions become more convincing. The last chapter is especially good on the submergence of gay life after Prohibition. This book is clearly one of the masterpieces of gay history, on par with John Boswell's work especially in it's dependence on primary sources.<br />The only criticism I have lies in the fact that Chauncey often has trouble shaping his information and often can't create a forest out of the trees. Especially in the earlier chapters, he often fails to make a summary statement without such a host of qualifiers that you wonder why he bothers in the first place. And as a previous reviewer has noted, there are alot of repetitions that a good editor should have corrected.<br />Despite all these reservations, for those interested in discovering a lost world, this book will be a revelation.	2003-12-31

However, the longer the book goes on, the more repetitive it becomes and offers sentences such as:<br />&quot;Whilst it has been suggested that appropriate location still played a part in staging this return as Gothic scenario, by establishing the modernity of the context into which the atavistic past intrudes, the taxonomical focus on &quot;development&quot; as a measure of contemporaneity meant that as an individual could &quot;embody&quot; the past, then atavism could potentially crop up anywhere&quot;. (p.153)<br />You see my point.<br />The latter chapters alternate falling into this technospeak, and the arguments become simultaneously less cogently argued and more diffuse. Ultimately I found myself skimming the very end as I finally lost patience with the book.<br />Mr. Mighall stands at the decision point whether to pursue a writing career based on the lucid persona of the Penguin introductions (his Dr. Jekyll, so to speak) or the obfuscation and diffuse arguments of his Academic writings (his Mr. Hyde). Once down one path, it can easily overwhelm the other. He is well too aware of the dangers of leading a double life.	2003-11-29
US	53051299	R1J5Y53UMB6X26	1568582722	490846684	The First Time I Met Frank O'Hara: Reading Gay American Writers	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A very good intro to great writers	I started this book with increasing reservations, wondering what this neophyte writer could say about the canon standards like Whitman and Thoreau and eventually decided: not much. But as the book progressed and Whitaker was on more contemporary turf, his comments became more insightful, more personal and more discerning. His thoughts on Jane Bowles, Glenway Wescott, Gore Vidal are very smart and reveals ideas buried within their work in a very convincing way. The writing is always lucid and even when not particularly brilliant, entertaining. Ultimately a very good place to start when approaching gay writing (or even, for that matter, a good place to end up).	2003-10-19

While by no means comprehensive, the wealth of material covered will certainly satisfy (if not aptly enrage)the average reader. The main problem with the book is that the material presented enrages the author himself too much. While the material covered is ostensibly presented as dispassionate reporting, the author's footnotes and editorial asides intrude too much in leading the reader into what he/she is supposed to think. Lest we miss yet another insult to basic human rights or cowardice on the part of the powers that be, these points are repeatedly underlined. So what appeared as a sociologic survey transforms into a book of personal essays. This is unfortunate because it is easy to be convinced of the authorial point of view if the facts are allowed to speak for themselves. Nonetheless worthwhile reading if not the book it hopes to be.	2003-10-04

The breadth and depth of the scholarship is staggering and the sheer wealth of the material overwhelming. Never have I read such a detailed argument based on such familiarity and mastery of the material. To remain unconvinced of the argument, when faced with such an extraordinary amount of evidence, reveals a deep seated abhorrence to the idea that the Catholic Church and the basic documents for the Christian faith contain little if any prohibitions against homosexuality greater than that of many rules that have long been discarded. It is only comparatively recently (i.e. after the Twelfth Century) that prejudice against homosexuals have become linked with Christian doctrine. Such abhorrence cannot be dealt with by reason, argument and review of the historical evidence and remains quite literally irrational. Those personally invested in maintaining this prejudice will find reasons to be unconvinced (see some of the comments below). But if approached with an open mind, a mind unwilling to be sidetracked with caveats that miss the grand vista opened by this work, the reader will be persuaded as well.	2003-08-17

She, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein, Peter Pan and a similar select company of works of popular fiction, works on a concious level of fantasy adventure narrative and multiple other levels of meaning, in this instance involving race, colonialism, sexuality, 19th Century anxieties, etc. While totally un-PC (so be warned if the books you read need support 21st Century views of the third world and women)it has a wonderful dreamlike feel that taps into a collective unconcious of symbols and archetypes. Besides which, it's a good read.	2003-05-18

It is disheartening to read of all the absurdity that has been written about Cather (and, by extension, so many other wonderful writers)and realize the amount of dreadful criticism, narrow thinking and senseless writing that is being generated and propagated by the academic presses. This book is a breath of fresh air, showing that the Emperor of Academia really has no clothes.	2003-05-03

That's probably because Mr. Hammond doesn't try to overinterpret the evidence he has available (and it is quite alot) but leaves room for doubt and variable readings. This restraint (so rare in gay studies...believe me, I know) makes his book stand out in the field, that and the fact that he has unearthed a treasure trove of literature either unknown or known only to a few specialists. His facts are fascinating, his style engaging. Future research in the history of sexual writing will have to take his work into consideration. Bravo, Mr. Hammond!	2003-01-31

If you read this book not knowing who the author was, you would throw it across the room in irritation: enough about Shakespeare, when are you going to talk about the novel (play, poem, etc) under discussion. When are you going to stop making emphatic superlative statements and then refuse to back them up with any evidence? When are you going to supply some evidence for any of your opinions and not expect the reader to take it on faith because so august a critic is saying it? (For this part, I guess you WOULD have to know the author).<br />Probably the most annoying and egocentric book of lit crit I have ever read, saved somewhat by its brevity. Only the section on the Romantic poets was useful. As for the rest, might as well take Bloom's advice and read Shakespeare instead. Reading this book is a waste of time (and money).	2001-11-29

The characters are cardboard thin, the plot convolutions incomprehensible or arbitrary, the philosophy muddy and doesn't withstand close scrutiny, the whole story seeming purposeless except to carry out the predestined narrative framework. Nothing is at stake emotionally or intellectually; the whole enterprise feels hollow. It's one of those books that seems smart, until you really think about it. An easy way to kill time while reading, but little more.	2001-11-07
US	53051299	R173MAC2UCKKV0	0300090153	493025331	The Crafty Reader	Books	3	17	27	N	Y	Disappointing	The title and jacket discription of this worthy book is highly misleading. While purporting to explain the &quot;craft&quot; of reading (although disclaiming to actually &quot;teach&quot; that craft), it is merely a string of essays on items that are of interest to the author: how the New Critics estranged readers of poetry, how detective fiction plays with certain rules, what is the definition of science fantasy. The actually &quot;craft&quot; of reading is often thrown into the essays as an afterthought, when the author recalls that this is what his book was supposed to be about. While the essays themselves are not without interest and are clearly written, it is dishonest to advertise one thing and deliver another: a literary bait-and-switch. So let the reader (and buyer) beware.	2001-10-13

Happily I was not disappointed. Each story was a delicate balance between emotions difficult to convey and the spaces in a relationship when the communication doesn't quite gel. There is also a low current eroticism to many of these stories that only makes them that much more powerful. And once again, the author demonstrates a facility with creating a space and time that unfolds before the reader with a specificity that is almost visual. That, plus a wonderful storytelling ability makes this collection extraordinary, especially for such a young writer. Do yourself a favor and discover him now.	2001-07-07

This novel got respectful if unenthusiastic reviews in the press, and I would concur. The novel often seems more about the narrator than Ravelstein, and reads like thinly disguised memoir (and not particularly compelling memoir at that). Not an exciting read but if you are a Bellow fan (and I am), then something is better than none at all.	2001-06-24

Spender is known as a poet and memoirist, not a novelist. There is no narrative pace, the characters are thinly drawn, and the plot is meandering. It is interesting as an artifact in the Auden-Isherwood-Spender literary history, for those who care, not as a novel in itself. Let the reader be warned.	2001-06-24

A respectable start than descends into unintelligibility and stays there. I respect Ms. Morrison for what she is attempting to do. The fact that she has failed to do it has not deterred an overabundance of praise on her work. If you must read her, try The Bluest Eye instead. Somewhat better, and shorter.	2001-06-24

There were similar lyrical touches on every page and never a sense of a forced phrase or overwriting found in more publicized young writers.

If Highsmith is one of the &quot;stars&quot; of this field, mystery readers must have very low standards.	2001-04-30

The novel starts slow and almost has nothing to do with the rest of the book. The syntax is often screwy, with adverbs and advectives floating around awkwardly, not certain of which nouns to refer to. The ending is abrupt. Characters and details are elaborately introduced and then dropped.<br />All that being said, what a great read! Beside wonderful set pieces like the Battle of Waterloo, there is an endlessly surprising and romantic plot hammered to reality with perceptive insights into personal and political motivation. The book is bursting with characters to take to the heart, some &quot;rounded&quot; like Gina and Count Mosca, some &quot;flatter&quot; like Fabrizio and Clelia, all vivid and unpredictable.<br />This is not a neat, well-structured book. But if you need to satisfy an itch for a sweeping, sprawling, totally involving 19th Century epic, you've come to the right place.	2001-03-06

It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out. Try this book after you've hit the major works (i.e. Women in Love, etc.).	2001-01-29

Rather than retaining his modernist importance, his &quot;unadorned with a vengeance&quot; style and macho persona have fallen the way of parody and this, his &quot;best&quot; novel, clearly shows why.  As with so many stylistic extremists, one finds oneself focusing on the  writing and not on the written (the former bizarre, the latter dull and  unconvincing). And his adoring women, &quot;hot&quot; for the hero, remind  me of an old Mae West movie where the men, for no better reason than they  were written that way, are constantly praising the invisible charms of our  heroine. Time has moved on; so should we.	2000-04-18

Contrary to reputation, it is not &quot;difficult&quot; (in the way, say, Joyce or  Faulkner can be) but it is not for people who prefer to skim across novels  rather than immerse themselves in them. There is no use in my pulling out  the superlatives; to do so would just invite redundancy to the books that  have been written on him. But for anyone who loves reading (and who  checking out this review does not) I would consider it a great loss to have  gone through life, loving books as you do, and having missed out on Proust.  It is an experience that will remind you of why you love to read and stay  with you throughout your life.	1999-09-03

Overwritten, implausible and far too beholden to Proust (a model the author freely acknowledges) I found it's only achievement was  Makine's attempt to describe being an outsider in two worlds and a member  of none. He strives far too hard for literary effect and the effort shows  (why use one appropriate adjective when ten will do?). It seems clear to me  the critics who reviewed this book were starved for any gesture toward  writing serious literature and this resulted in overpraising a modest  effort (for another example, see &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;). The novel was  hated almost unanimously by my reading group.	1999-08-02

She peppers her New York novels with snappy one-liners and clever analysis of personality types. But she pays only the smallest attention to pace or  narrative. There are entertaining set pieces and frequently glittering  cynical prose but only the barest outline of a plot, here rapidly wrapped  up in a throw away ending. Read her for her wit, her ability to conjure up  a city that is no longer but not for her ability to flesh out characters or  for her story lines.	1999-01-19

What comes as no surprise after the fact is that the majority of this was hype; either that,  or the state of the novel in America is in a sorrier state than I thought.  Dull, predictable, with a metronomic structure of \\"his chapter/her  chapter\\", I couldn't wait for it to end. I admired the skill in  getting the language right and all the research it must have required  (hence my extra star) but as a work of imagination, power or even  entertainment it is severely lacking.
