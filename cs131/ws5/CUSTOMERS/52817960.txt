His expertise as a former sapper in the British military was put to good use--he was a more skillful digger than his Sudanese companions. <br /> <br />What I remember most about the book was Asher relating how, because of the impoverished sensory stimulation of the desert's sameness, he was able to clearly follow single trains of thought for hours and hours without interruption. <br /> <br />I wonder if these same impoverished sensory conditions could have resulted in the delusions associated with the nascence of the three principal revealed religions--Islam, Christianity and Judaism?	2005-05-02

And it's a loooong book.)<br />A necessary first biography<BR>(In the sense that it sets out the chronology of a life, but in no way sufficiently addresses any one of Walcott's multiplicity of interests.

The day-by-day, season-by-season chronology develops a rhythm and momentum--a stateliness--into which the reader finds himself or herself drawn. Speaking for myself, I was unprepared for any of it to end. [Thank you, Dr Y!])<br />Readers need to be patient with Yochelson. He explicitly discusses his approach (page 435) in this first full biography of a truly huge life-Yochelson felt compelled to choose between chronology and theme. He opted for the (thankless, lifeless) former. Some readers will find this approach to be unsatisfactory.<br />Having now read both volumes I feel replete, as well as depleted. I have two wishes:<BR>1. That others (not excluding Ellis Yochelson himself) will take up the themes of Walcott's interests (geology, paleontology, conservation, forestry, photography, aviation, business, art) and treat each of them in a dedicated way.<BR>2. That the Smithsonian takes steps to return to the Dominion of Canada all of its fossil collections made by Charles Doolittle Walcott. (Yep, that's my wish.)

History: see Pulitzer Prize winning 'Summer for the Gods' by Edward Larson. This book explains what actually happened in Tennessee in 1925. Larson's book also explains why Lawrence and Lee wrote their play in the 1950s. You could also try 'Clarence Darrow's Cross-Examination of William Jennings Bryan in Tennessee Vs. John Thomas Scopes' by Younger Irving (Editor). This short book is the actual transcript of the court case. You can make up your own mind who actually won.    2. Science: there is now a huge popular science press. If you are interested in 'origins' then consider trying 'The Crucible of Creation' by Simon Conway Morris. If you are interested in the 'monkey' side of things then try something by Richard Leakey.    3. Sociology of science: Books in this category discuss how scientists use the knowledge available to them to make new discoveries. Books in this group are hard to read but they help to understand what things were like in the past. 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions' by Thomas Kuhn is hard, but good. We've all heard about Copernicus, Darwin and Einstein. Kuhn's book helps to take you back 450 years, 150 years and 100 years to the days when these scientists were struggling with really, really difficult ideas. The ideas were difficult because they were the opposite to everything known at the time. Everyone knows the sun orbits the earth. Everyone knows the world is 6000 years old and that creation took seven days. Only a fool would think that simply by speeding up an object that it gets heavier and heavier, and that the clock you are using to measure the speed is running slower and slower.

Yochelson does detail the early career of an important American scientist by bringing together all of the relevant source documents. The context is the XIXth c. amalgamation of classical geology and paleontology. From the  perspective of the late XXth c. we see the geological debates in which  Charles Walcott was involved as our &quot;big picture&quot; stuff--the  ordering and naming of rock and time sequences, major rock correlations,  index fossils.<br />This book is not literature, but rather, an example of the  meat-and-potatoes variety of biography that is long on factual reportage  and short on speculation and imputation. Nonetheless Walcott, the man,  shines through as the last of a dying breed--a decent, unpretentious and  hard-working scientist. <br />Readers need to be aware the book stops well  short of Walcott's collecting trips to the Burgess Shale in Yoho National  Park, British Columbia.	1999-03-01

The &quot;waning of the Middle Ages&quot; is the argot of the scholar.  Tuchman perfers to explore the &quot;collapsing assumptions&quot; of that  era, thus contemporizing the respective calamities of the 14th and 20th  centuries. The power of the book lies in the detail.	1998-09-20

Mother points dramatically to a thoroughly flattened cat lying on the roadway. \\"Look at that!\\" she exclaims to her four-year old child. \\"THAT  cat crossed the road without asking its mother first!!\\" Child bursts into a torrent of tears (and never again crosses a road without first asking mother.)	1998-09-05

The experienced cycle  tourist will know what I mean. I recommend newcomers who want a book to try  one of Slavinski's, as well as books by other cyclists. Perhaps you'll  discover a writer who &quot;speaks&quot; to you. If not, then you may end  up writing your own. Or you may become a truly independent rider--no books,  *no* maps. Try it!	1998-09-04

I couldn't quite decide which one to adopt. Would it be Hallucigenia? or  maybe Opabinia? Endearing critters, one and all. And all with a Purpose.  Gould's fossils' Purpose is to serve to place &quot;science&quot; within  the context of its culture. The book succeeds spectacularly. The next step  for the committed reader is the scholarly work of Robert K. Merton. (Not  about fossils but about the sociology of science.)  P.S. I'm making the haj  from New Zealand to Yoho National Park in the summer of 1999. See you  there!	1998-09-04

US	52817960	R32Y1I2E1SAZJ3	0140094296	458351721	The Songlines	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A great work of fiction--repeat FICTION	Prior to publication Chatwin had huge arguments with the publishers. He  said the book was fiction but the publishers said it was non-fiction.  Naturally enough the publishers won the battle. Hence, my local library has  the book in the Australian travel section. Amazon does too. Chatwin is now  emerging from culthood. This is a good thing because it means readers can  read his work without all of the emotional baggage that was attached to  Bruce Chatwin's life and lifestyle. The Songlines will endure.	1998-08-30
