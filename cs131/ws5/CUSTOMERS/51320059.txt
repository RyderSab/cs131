I've enjoyed Mccarthy's novels, particularly BLOOD MERIDIAN and CHILD OF GOD, but there's something badly wrong with this latest effort.  For one thing, about half the novel seems to have gone missing.  For another, the long-suffering reader gets no payoff at all... the novel doesn't end, the pages just stop coming.  The ruminations of an implausibly elderly sheriff named Bell run the gamut from pointless to senseless, and the main villain, \\"Sugar,\\" who is initially quite terrifying, ultimately becomes a verbose bore not much different from Bell.  [I know, I know, Bell and Sugar are supposed to be similar in many respects.]  Mccarthy still does a good job of reproducing conversations, but when those conversations go nowhere, reading them can be crushingly tedious.  I simply could not endure the interminable conversation between the character Moss and a teenage hitchhiker; I had to skip it, and I suspect Mcarthy knew most readers would because he then slaps the reader in the face as hard as an author can, on the next page.<br /><br />Readers who get through this piffle are the ones who probably deserve that slap, not the wiser ones who bailed out (like Bell back in WWII) when the situation got hopeless.	2005-08-16

If you have ever seen a \\"Chinese Circus\\" you have probably seen quite a few of the stunts described in this volume demonstrated, such as the wrapping of long steel rebars tightly around the neck of the performer by two husky assistants, with no apparent harm being done.<br /><br />Here we have some very brief discussions of a number of stunts performed in China by \\"masters\\" of \\"Vagabond\\"-style chi-kung. Some tricks will be familiar to those well-versed in \\"geek\\"-style US magic, others are a bit more exotic and unusual.  The book is well-illustrated by strangely-styled line drawings, together with black-and-white and color photos.<br /><br />Chapter 5 discusses \\"body tricks\\" in which the performer appears able to make parts of his body rock-hard or super-strong; Chapter 6 discusses tricks to make it appear you can exert force at a distance, without touch.  Chapter 7 discusses the standard levitation illusion often done by Indian fakirs in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Chapter 8 discusses some very simple magic tricks with an oriental flavor, routined to be done on stage for a large audience.  Chapter 9 continues with more stage magic and psychic feats.  At least half of the stunts described will already be more-or-less familiar to well-posted US magicians.<br /><br />The explanations are very, very terse and often incomplete, while many of the stunts described are potentially very, very dangerous.  Furthermore, many of the methods presented are laughably primitive, clumsy and hazardous. For example, the spoon-bending (!?!) method does not use sleight-of-hand and ordinary spoons, as favored by all US magicians, but rather depends on hand-made fake spoons and mild acids!  Another effect is achieved by dropping dilute acid on an audience member!<br /><br />I believe an expert, professional magician who frequently presents bizarre or \\"geek\\"-style magic could find some ideas here that he could develop or evolve into something both practical and safe, but much thought, work and experimentation would generally be required. About 10 years ago a performer here in Austin seriously injured his wife doing one of the stunts described in this book, namely cutting a watermelon resting on someone's stomach completely in two with a single blow from a Samurai-style sword.<br /><br />This book is the second in a projected series of three.  I have not seen the first, and the third (announced by an advertisment in the first and only, 1991 edition of BEHIND THE INCREDIBLES) was apparently never published.ought, work and experimentation would generally be required.

Jan Mark has never been afraid to tackle big issues in her award-winning novels and short story collections.  This early novel takes on one of the biggest issues of all, the inherently evil nature of organized religion--- a hard fact citizens of the US currently are having their noses rubbed against almost daily.<br /><br />Mark's protagonist, Hanno, lives in what might well be Middle Earth... clearly England, but in no known time period. The town he lives in is dominated by a huge Temple, which  every year choses a young man to be the \\"Shepherd,\\" a living link between ordinary men and a distant, silent god.  Hanno is keeping secret his deteriorating eyesight, by avoiding the family business of pottery and working as a river boatman.  Despite his total disbelief in the city's religion, Hanno is chosen as the new Shepherd.  Over the next year he is held as a virtual prisoner within the Temple; his health and eyesight deteriorate precipitously, as he is mentally and physically tortured by the Temple guards; and, coincidentally, attendance at the Temple services plummets nearly to zero.  There's a harmless lunatic living in the ceremonial space with Hanno, and the mysterious death of the lunatic creates a new religious cult which is immediately incorporated within the Temple's teachings, causing a huge revival of public interest in religion and attendance at Temple services... all according to someone's plan.<br /><br />All truth is in The Book, which sits chained to an immobile lectern by the Temple altar. But Hanno makes a horrifying discovery about this handwritten document... and he also finds evidence that animal sacrifice used to be part of the Temple's ritual... so he begins to wonder if human sacrifices occurred before an animal was substituted.  As the Temple rituals begin to change rapidly, to incorporate the lunatic Prophet's supposed future visions and nonexistent \\"teachings,\\" Hanno justifiably wonders if the end of his year's tenure as Shepherd will end with his own sacrifice!<br /><br />The novel has some defects.  Hanno is a bit too helpless and passive to be a truly worthy focus for the reader's attention; and, the core teachings and internal organization of the Temple never really emerge,  with even the little that is seen not making much anthropological sense to me, although this is probably a deliberate choice of the author's.  My copy of the book is ex-library, and does not appear to have ever been checked out.ll end with his own sacrifice!    <br /> <br />The novel has some defects.

About 283 pages of continual, if witty, ranting can wear even the sympathetic reader down. This volume's contents jump a bit disorientingly from topic to topic, and its purpose mainly seems to be to preserve a number of short articles that appeared in various obscure publications.<br /><br />\\"Compulsive Playacting\\" deals with the cultural and pseudoscientific manifestations of the universal human tendency to love to pretend to be someone else... to play a different part on life's theater stage. \\"Hypnotism\\" is a topic the author really understands inside and out, due to his years of travelling with stage hypnotists in Canada and Australia.  \\"Recovered Memories\\" explores the cultural consequences, some quite dreadful, of \\"therapist-guided\\" playacting. \\"Mediocrer than Thou\\" seems inspired mainly by the author's experiences within higher education, particularly within colleges of education.  \\"My Alien Can Lick Your Alien\\" deals very briefly and superficially  with the familiar myths of UFOs and flying saucers. \\"Psychics and Other Time Travellers\\" deals equally briefly and casually with fortune tellers, psychics and prophets-for-hire.  \\"Come In, Sucker\\" is a catch-all chapter covering a wide range of other pseudoscience, from Scientology to Velikovski and the Bermuda Triangle, with each particular pseudoscience summarized and dismissed in typically a single paragraph or so.<br /><br />  \\"The Rise of the Mediocracy\\" deals with the 20th Century restructuring of society so that leaders and decision makers now tend to be selected for exceptional stupidity and incompetence.  The book was, alas, written too long ago to make use of the current US presidential administration as a paradigm case.  \\"Conspiracies and Cover-Ups\\" takes a look at very successful, real conspiracies that are therefore totally unknown to most folks, versus the very familiar supposed conspiracies that are known to everyone! Strange how that works!  \\"Six of... Half a dozen of...\\" is another catch-all chapter that covers a large number of unrelated topics in pseudoscience, while sympathetically and contrarily reviving a forgotten bit of pseudoanthropology,  the \\"aquatic ape\\". Other chapters deal with the pseudosciences of clinical psychology and psychoanalysis; quack medicine and \\"alternative therapies\\";  the origins of sexual taboos;  competition among religious cults; yet more \\"psychic\\" pseudoscience; the pseudoscience of the \\"insanity plea\\"; the evolution of television programming from the late-1950s \\"vast wasteland\\" to the current \\"toxic waste dump\\"; and, finally the origins of some of the more popular religions (and here, the author is something of an expert, having researched these origins for his Ph. D., and having dealt with them at much greater length in previous publications).<br /><br />As I mentioned at the start, the book's tone is that of witty but angry rant.  Readers not already on the author's side of the arguments would, if they ever were to pick up the book, put it back down after a few paragraphs.  The author's pet hatreds, K-12 educational pseudoscience, college of education faculty,  lawyers, politicians,  and trade unions, come in  for pounding at every opportunity, and it's not that these targets don't deserve hard punches, but rather that extreme reader-fatigue due to repetition and seeming random jumping from topic to topic makes one feel the book was edited by a rock-video director with overwhelming personal issues!apter that covers a large number of unrelated topics in pseudoscience, while sympathetically and contrarily reviving a forgotten bit of pseudoanthropology,  the \\"aquatic ape\\".

In the 1980s, Frank Thomas wrote a number of novels featuring Sherlock Holmes and Watson, and all were published in German, I believe, but not all in English due to a paperback publisher going paws-up in the midst of the series.  Now some of these are being brought to print, or reprinted as the case may be, by Xlibris.<br /><br />Events of the present novel seem to take place right after the previous Thomas-authored adventure of the Panamanian Girls. Holmes and Watson are called to France to investigate a mysterious theft from the Louvre, then back to England to deal with a baffling kidnapping of a 6-month-old child from the family of Britain's chief economic advisor,  a strange night attack on Miss Regina Braham in her own bedroom, and a suspicious buyup of DeBeers diamond mining stock.  All the cases conveniently turn out to be connected, and the identity and motive of the ultimately-revealed villain took me by surprise.  As usual in the later Holmes novels of Frank Thomas, Holmes employs a fairly large set of shady individuals with slightly illegal talents, in the course of his investigation, and gets a lot of help from Mycroft's multitalented aide Wakefield Orloff.  I read the novel in a few hours, with a permanent smile on my face... the company was very pleasant, Holmes was true to his origins,  the reader's intelligence  was not insulted, and the plot and action held my interest throughout.<br /><br />As with all the Xlibris books I have inspected, misprints are very few (I noted only a case of misplaced quotation marks), but someone needed to write down the word \\"bizarre\\" on a scrap of paper and tape it up where they could view it constantly. It is spelled correctly on the book's front cover, but not on the spine!  It is spelled correctly in the text, but not on the title pages or on the page headers!	2005-03-19

By modern standards it violates most rules of popular history, with its many \\"reconstructed\\" conversations and events, which had no living witnesses shortly after the fact.  However, Burns did manage to conduct long, direct interviews with many still-living participants, something later historians could not hope to do.<br /><br />Historians tend to be either strongly pro- or anti-Billy, and it is interesting that this 1925 narrative hews to a sort of neutral line, depicting both the positive and negative aspects of the Kid's character.  The early Kid biography supposedly written by Pat Garrett himself already depicts the Kid as a dime-novel superhero; by contrast, Nelson Nye's somewhat later historical novel, A BULLET FOR BILLY THE KID, typically depicts the Kid as a cowardly, psychopathic monster without a single redeeming human feature. Historians also tend to be violently pro- or anti-Dolan-Murphy, Burns comes down very much on the anti-Dolan-Murphy side, which is the side most more recent historians have also come down on.  Burns also spends more time on the background of John Chisum than most Kid historians have tended to do.<br /><br />Well worth your reading time if  you have any interest in the most famous \\"outlaw\\" of the Old West.	2005-03-06

This science-fictional outing by Jan Mark was obviously inspired partially by politically-correct insanity within the US in the late 1990s, triggered by the discovery of \\"Kennewick Man,\\" and including deranged legal attempts to prevent archaeologists from examining the fossil! It  is \\"juvenile fiction\\" only in the sense that the main character, Merrick Korda, is a graduate student at a university.  The themes and settings are otherwise entirely adult. In Mark's mid-23rd Century world, archaeology is largely forbidden, barely tolerated, because it concentrates on \\"origins\\" in a culture that is attempting to become completely homogeneous. The subtle key to the novel's incidents is that in this culture, also, people almost invariably live alone. Thus the main character, Merrick, and his major professor Turcat, fail to understand until far, far too late that no one can be trusted, no matter how sympathetic they appear, or how cooperative they are, given that the researches of Merrick and Turcat have uncovered the long-buried secret of an impossibly valuable item.<br /><br />Mark must be congratulated for one of the kinkiest sex scenes ever included in a \\"young adult\\" novel, although it is tastefully confined to a few sentences.  The ending will leave most readers dissatisfied, to say the least, since Merrick never really figures out what is going on and the story is told from his viewpoint.  We never find out precisely who has been working behind the scenes to cause all the trouble, much less what their precise motives and goals might be.<br /><br />As usual in Mark's short stories and novels, all the characters are complex and have \\"deep revolving\\" matters going on beneath their placid, civilized surfaces, but because of the narrow focus on  Merrick most of them do not make much impression.  Unlike in most science fiction, where there is a continual emphasis on razzle-dazzle advances in technology, Mark's story fills in the background of this distant future world slowly and indirectly.  As another reviewer remarks, the result is \\"sophisticated,\\" and demands quite a bit from the reader.  Marketed as a \\"young adult\\" novel in the US, it will never reach the audience that could appreciate it.slowly and indirectly.

Plus, time travel is routine and meddling with the past is always threatening to destabilize the \\"present\\" in fantastic ways.  Plus, this world is not otherwise ours.  There was no World War II, for example.<br /><br />And now imagine one final thing: the novelist is himself so apparently bereft of invention that virtually nothing happens in a given novel!  This is certainly the case in SOMETHING ROTTEN... I haven't read the author's previous three novels set in this world.  Other reviewers on these pages have speculated that, (1) either the author is \\"holding back\\" for future novels, or (2) has already completely run out of inspiration.  Hard to say.  The author's web page is a lot funnier than this novel, anyway.<br /><br />Other problems: the main character, Thursday Next and her often non-existent husband Landen have no personality whatsoever; they are essentially holes in the page.  This is especially noticable when most of the other characters, even minor ones, are vividly drawn. Nor does the main character ever really do anything, other than fret constantly as to where she is going to find a babysitter.<br /><br />Other problems: the humor is of that very mild, biteless, repetitive, linear, obvious sort  that I tend to think of as aimed at female readers.  What little satire there is comes out at  such a gentle, polite and ladylike level that one wonders why the author bothers. The policies of this novel's villain seem to be inspired by the real-world horrors of the Bush II administration, but the similarities really go nowhere. Similarly, the supposed attempt of the evil Goliath corporation to turn itself into a church not only goes nowhere, but isn't even taken seriously by the author himself.<br /><br />Other problems: it may seem a lark to give all characters \\"comical\\" names along the lines of  Brik Schitte-Hawse or Jack Schitt, and it may even produce a mild smile on the reader's face the first time, but when the characters are mentioned on every page, the mild smile quickly turns into a grimace of misery.  It's like being trapped in a Ben Stiller movie.<br /><br />Other problems: the book is illustrated, and the illustrations are primitive, unprofessional and inept.<br /><br />The publisher's blurb says this whole mess is \\"more than a little wacky.\\"  Well, even in a parallel universe, there's no \\"w\\" in \\"mainly pointless.\\"acters \\"comical\\" names along the lines of  Brik Schitte-Hawse or Jack Schitt, and it may even produce a mild smile on the reader's face the first time, but when the characters are mentioned on every page, the mild smile quickly turns into a grimace of misery.

One of the ironies of the Golden Age of Television is that some of its most ambitious programming coincided with the primitive infancy of the medium, 1949 -- 1955. Given that all programming was being broadcast \\"live\\" as it happened, in \\"real time,\\" TV directors and producers nevertheless dared to present, in CAPTAIN VIDEO (1949-55), TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET (1950-55) and SPACE PATROL (1950-55), often action-packed science-fictional adventures with complex practical and special effects... and anywhere from 30 minutes once a week to 30 minutes every weekday!<br /><br />As the casts and crews of these series are steadily taken away from us by time, we are also losing all personal contact with this most heroic (in several senses of the word!) era of early live television broadcasting.  So it is  very welcome to find this 400-plus-page book by Jean-Noel Bassior, entirely devoted to SPACE PATROL.  She began work on the book in the early 1980s, when almost all the cast and crew except for Lyn Osborn (Cadet Happy) were still alive and available for interview, and portions of more than 50 separate interviews are incorporated throughout the book.  The book is also copiously illustrated with a large number of clearly-reproduced and often quite rare photos.<br /><br />More than 20 individual chapters cover almost every aspect of the series, including cast, crew, and writers.  About the only significant  omission that struck me was that of Carl Macauley, designer of the very impressive and spacious sets... there's not much about him compared to other key crew members. Readers will also find appendices contributed by various experts,  describing various Space Patrol-related toys and premiums, the 30-minute network TV episodes, some of the surviving 30-minute radio episodes, and the most-often-seen miniature buildings and spaceships of the series.<br /><br />Mike Moser's sudden death in the spring of 1953 (struck by a car as he stepped off a dark curb) tolled the end for SPACE PATROL. When Nina Bara (Tonga) reminded Moser's widow of various unkept promises made by Moser to the cast, she was promptly fired.  The daily 15-minute broadcasts vanished from the lineup, a development welcomed by the greatly overworked cast and crew.  More ominously, by the fall of 1953, kids and their parents who ordered from the impressive catalog of SPACE PATROL toys and merchandise were receiving only a letter explaining that neither the items nor a refund would ever be forthcoming... from a company Moser had mainly operated out of the trunk of his own car!  Moser's widow Helen didn't really know what to do with the program she inherited, and as soon as the key sponsor pulled out, that was the end, except for a syndicated series of old kinescope recordings on 35 mm film that could be seen spottily on TV in the late 1950s.<br /><br />Many kinescoped episodes of SPACE PATROL are available for viewing today on video tape. Seen more than half a century after they were broadcast, and by jaded adults rather than starry-eyed children of the early Space Age, they don't usually hold up well.  The weakest element by far is the scripting, while the sets are often extremely impressive.  Ed Kemmer (Commander Buzz Corry) is a completely convincing hero; Lyn Osborn (Happy) is as funny and charming as his often poorly written part allows, and his character's relationship with Kemmer's is always believable.  Virginia Hewitt (Carol) and Nina Bara (Tonga) come across as simultaneously sexy and intelligent; Ken Mayer (Robbie) is reliable as the only other SPACE PATROL officer we usually get to see; and whatever the name of the villain he plays, Bela Kovacs is always just on the verge of a terrifying burst of hysterical ill-temper.

This 1983 collection of eight short stories by Jan Mark won a literary prize,and certainly deserves one.  All of the stories involve students in the British equivalents of high school and college.  And all create vivid, realistic characters who deal with realistic situations in a realistic way. Mothers who want to get their children reading something in addition to fairly sterile and narrow fantasies about Harry Potter might well be advised to turn to Jan Mark's works.  While the British locales and slang could seem a bit exotic for young US readers, it's the kind of exoterica that adds fascination.<br /><br />\\"Feet\\" puts an inexperienced young girl in as tennis umpire in a school tourney, and circumstances result in her public humiliation, immediately followed by a chance to retaliate, but fairly, against the boy who humiliated her.  \\"Posts and Telecommunications\\" features a young girl frustrated by her inability to communicate with her increasingly \\"busy\\" single parent.  When he remarries, the new wife tries to keep the lines open, but when she grows increasingly busy and remote too, the girl finds an opportunity to use the very remoteness of the communication to take a terrible revenge against both the vanishing adults in her life. Historians of the computer age will be fascinated by a \\"giant\\" 32 K computer complete with portable TV for use as a monitor, featuring in a minor way in the story.<br /><br />One theme that seems to run through all the Mark works I have read to date is the silent courage of family members who have no choice but to put up with intolerable family situations.  Samples here include \\"Poor Darling,\\" in which a young boy endures the public behavior of a mother who gives new depth to the term \\"superbitch,\\" and \\"A Little Misunderstanding,\\" in which  a high-school age(?) boy finds, to his horror, that his best friend Kipper has been adversely affected, to say the least, by an unendurable religious revival service that the boys are dragged to by a religious-fanatic parent... Kipper's way of ending the torment puts his friend in a fix almost too terrible to imagine, unless, like me, you were raised around Southern Baptists!<br /><br />In \\"I was adored once, too,\\" an unpopular kid who normally works the lights for the school drama productions winds up playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek in TWELFTH NIGHT, and learns by direct and immediate experience how to deliver Sir Andrew's greatest line.  \\"Enough is Too Much Already\\" shows the British equivalent of rapid transit destroying the possibilities of two budding young romances.  And \\"Mrs. Tulkinghorne's First Symphony\\" has a teenage lad in a disturbing encounter with a deeply conflicted wealthy wife on vacation. \\"Still Life: Remote Control\\" takes us into the college art class from Hell itself.<br /><br />Ever seen a British film involving rural antics, where you couldn't understand a word said by at least half the characters? In \\"A Little Misunderstanding,\\" young Cobbold has to translate every word spoken by his father Mr. Jack for his pal Kipper. Yes, the incomprehensibility of rural dialects is a standing joke among the Brits.<br /><br />I learned something valuable from every one of these stories.

Do you need it? Definitely, if you are a Spillane fan and appreciator.  Here's what you get:  \\"Tomorrow I Die\\" is an exploration of the \\"unfolding identity\\" theme to be found in almost all  Spillane's fiction.  Robbers think the main character is the town's mayor, and take him hostage in making their escape.  Townspeople recognize him as a washed-up actor who had just gotten off the Greyhound bus. Both groups are wrong, wrong, wrong!  \\"The Girl Behind the Hedge\\" has one businessman get terrible revenge on his evil business rival... and the weapon is love of an unattainable object.<br /><br />\\"Stand Up and Die!\\" has a cargo pilot dropping into a nest of inbred, xenophobic hillbillies, with all roads and routes of escape blocked.  There are no identity switches here, just a nasty revelation about the motivations of the two leaders among the hillbillies.  \\"The Pickpocket\\" is a two-pager in which a reformed pickpocket overcomes a major obstacle.  \\"The Screen Test of Mike Hammer\\" is just what it appears to be, a short, original script which was filmed (starring Jack Stang as Hammer and Jonathan Winters(!) as a hobo) by Spillane in hopes of helping Stang to win the role of Hammer in the first proposed film, KISS ME DEADLY.  It was Ralph Meeker who ultimately got the part. \\"Sex is my Vengeance\\" is a fictionalized version of what might have been a real interview with a high-priced call girl conducted by Spillane; it seems fairly realistic apart from the intrusion of some standard cliches about prostitution and prostitutes. \\"Trouble... Come and Get It!\\" is a real rarity, a comic book \\"text\\" by Spillane from 1941.  This needs to be explained to anyone not familiar with Golden Age comics.  In order to qualify for the low \\"magazine\\" mailing rates, comics of the 1940s and early 1950s had to have at least two pages that were pure \\"text,\\" basically a short-short story.  It was the thankless task of the regular comics scripters to write these texts, which none of the comic-reading youngsters would ever bother to read.  This example from Spillane, while written for kids, shows clear traces of his later style.<br /><br />\\"The Gold Fever Tapes\\" seems to be a later adventure of an earlier Spillane hero, Cat Fallon.  There's enough material for a novel, and the lack of detailed development makes it appear as if Spillane is just trying to get the key concept (a really weird method of smuggling gold) off his chest. The most stereotypical Spillane work in the collection is the final novelet, \\"Everybody's Watching Me.\\"  Here a \\"punk kid\\" finds himself caught between three rival gang leaders and their gangs, and some corrupt cops.  Everyone is afraid of a mystery man named Vetter, and I was hoping against hope from the first page that you-know-who would not implausibly turn out to be Vetter, but alas, Spillane didn't seem to want to spend much time twisting and re-twisting the ending of this one.<br /><br />It's anyone's guess why Spillane stopped writing novels in 1953, turned to shorter fiction for magazines, and then jumped back to novels in the 1960s.  The introduction by Collins speculates; you can make up your own mind after taking in these shorter works that date mainly from 1953 to 1958.hankless task of the regular comics scripters to write these texts, which none of the comic-reading youngsters would ever bother to read.

Pre-teen Erica has a secret love, motorcycles.  When she is sent for \\"vacation\\" to a remote, rural area of England, in an isolated household occupied by three scarcely-human creeps, she finds her life revolving around picking and selling vegetables from the household's garden.  Not much chance to see motorcycles here, presumably. But a visit to the nearest village introduces her to an \\"industrial park\\" consisting only of a seedy,  muddy alley, and... a MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP!<br /><br />Every detail of this fine novel aimed at \\"young adults\\" rings true, the characters intended to be likeable are extremely so, and there is actually a plot of sorts, ultimately involving the creative \\"tatooing\\" of what the Brits call \\"vegetable marrows,\\" which I take to be a kind of cucumber.  Several of the characters, for example the owner of the motorcycle repair shop, silently bear crosses of a sort which would be crushing to the weak.  Whatever your age, in reading this book you will spend a couple of hours with people you like, in realistic and interesting situations, and you will learn some important lessons about real life in the bargain.	2004-10-07
US	51320059	RF1IJYWNDED9N	0690039026	506429471	Thunder and Lightnings	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Debut	If I'm not mistaken, this was Jan Mark's first novel; she went on to write many more.  I picked this up in a used book store, not knowing anything about book or author.  When I finally got around to reading it, I was mainly delighted.  Mark has a gift for creating likeable characters--- and in this case, these characters are about all there is to the story; there is really no plot at all.  In the 1970s, a somewhat bohemian, laid-back family moves to the British coast, near an air base.  In school, the new kid meets a weird-looking kid who seems mildly retarded and whose family is almost insanely strict.  The two boys become friends as the weird kid, who turns out to be a genuine expert in any topic that interests him, shares his enthusiasm for British military aircraft with the new kid.  That's really about all there is to the novel. Essentially nothing happens, we just share a few outings with the two new friends.  However, the realism and depth of the characters, even those we see only for a page or two, is very impressive.  I look forward to seeking out this prolific writer's later books for \\"young adults\\" and adults.	2004-09-30

Obtaining and reading this paperback a week or so ago allowed me the satisfaction of being able to complete a shelf of Spillane in paperback.  What you get here are two short novels (novelets, novellas?) that lean heavily on plot devices and situations Spillane has used many times before.  But what you also get is another great Spillane tough guy, operating in a world seemingly inhabited only by other tough guys, all out to do in our hero.  The ending of ME, HOOD is unsurprising simply because we recognize the familiar plot, but there are some genuine surprises in the sequel, RETURN OF THE HOOD.  If you like Spillane, you need this, one of the more difficult-to-find of his paperbacks.	2004-08-22
US	51320059	R1F11MPM741MQJ	0801878675	238432655	Debunked!: ESP, Telekinesis, and Other Pseudoscience	Books	2	17	21	N	Y	Chaotic!	For perhaps 2 decades, at the University of Nice, Prof. Broch has taught a course analyzing the claims of pseudoscience.  He has also published a number of books on the topic; this is the only one ever to be translated into English.  It may be the last.  I assume this particular specimen was chosen because the co-author is Nobel prizewinning physicist Georges Charpak, but it was difficult for me to detect Charpak's contributions.<br /><br />The  bad news is that the book looks as if it were assembled by Prof. Broch sitting down and pulling material pretty much at random from the presentations in his courses.  The text is never lucid and sometimes lapses into outright incoherence; I found portions to be completely unreadable.<br /><br />I would recommend skipping the prologue altogether.  Chapter 1 begins with Astrology and the Forer Effect; most of the discussion makes sense but illustrations and tables often don't. I would, for example, like to see someone make any sense of the table on page 12, particularly in view of the instructions to select \\"one box at random from each of the four columns numbered 2 to 4.\\"  Of course the columns are not numbered, but if you reread the instructions you'll see that could hardly matter!  The whole book is like this.  The chapter suddenly veers from astrology to a \\"telephone psychic\\" mindreading trick.  Then suddenly there are very brief discussions of antiquated levitation illusions, sitting on broken glass shards and beds of nails, a 500-year-old version of \\"skewer through tongue,\\" firewalking, and one of Broch's classroom demonstrations with nitinol wire.  Throughout, when books are mentioned, the reference is almost always to a French-language edition, even when the book was first published in English; can you say, \\"no editing?\\"<br /><br />Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of various \\"paradoxes\\" of probability, and it is probably the best-written and most lucid portion of the book.  The chapter then veers off into \\"the man in the moon\\" illusion, the human tendency to see patterns in randomness.<br /><br />Chapter 3 touches on dowsing, and then comes the now-expected swerve into a disconnected topic, in this case the \\"mysterious\\" presence of water in a sarcophagus at Arles-sur-Tech in the Pyrenees.  In the aftermath of the fairly non-coherent discussion, about all I came away with was that French TV \\"documentary\\" producers and writers are just as uninterested in fact as British and U.S. TV \\"documentary\\" producers and writers. Then there's another swerve into the pseudoscience of obtaining water in large quantities by \\"condensation\\" from the air.  Then there is yet another swerve, into public fears of radioactivity.  I suspect this is the only portion of the text Charpak had much input into, but it does not read any more lucidly than the rest of the book.  The basic point of the discussion, to the extent I could make any sense of it, is that activists and the public irrationally worry about \\"artifical\\" and highly localized sources of radiation while seemingly being totally ignorant of natural sources spread over the entire globe which provide doses 100 or 1,000 times those of the \\"artifical\\" sources.<br /><br />Chapter 4 seems to deal with the penetration of occult beliefs into French academia.  But maybe not.  As in the other chapters, the focus, if any, is fuzzy at best. Chapter 5 turns on the apparently subtle fact that being tolerant of others' beliefs is good, but being tolerant of obvious factual errors is bad. The book ends with a brief appendix on calculating probabilities.<br /><br />I am sure that Prof. Broch teaches an excellent course and indeed I wish I could sit in on it. But this particular book is going to find few if any readers in the English-speaking world.e man in the moon\\" illusion, the human tendency to see patterns in randomness. <br /> <br />Chapter 3 touches on dowsing, and then comes the now-expected swerve into a disconnected topic, in this case the \\"mysterious\\" presence of water in a sarcophagus at Arles-sur-Tech in the Pyrenees.

Moore is considerably more serious here than in his previous novels, with the possible exception of LAMB.  And the plot involves the gradual revelation of a mindbendingly huge concept that completely overshadows all the characters and their relations to one another.  And the villains never really come on stage, but just leer at the audience through gaps in the curtain.  And Moore's research involves some REAL science for a change.  So I think this book will tend to disappoint many of Moore's regular readers; he is varying the mixture, which for me is a good thing.<br /><br />If you want Moore to just keep writing the same book over and over,  while keeping the gags coming at a constant rate, I think you will feel let down by FLUKE.  If you are coming  to Moore for the first time, have a real sense of humor, and enjoy grappling with \\"huge\\" ideas, you'll probably find it worth your time.	2004-08-19

This book, and the recent biography by Peter Levi, are the ones I have been most satisfied with.<br /><br />The real strength of Professor Chute's book is her insistence on placing Shakespeare accurately as one of the most famous ACTORS of his day.  On lists of the companies of players he often appears first or second.  Now, as Prof. Chute makes clearer than anyone else, this tells us a lot about the man.  Prominent actors not only had to be healthy and athletic, they had to be great fencers... the audience expected to see incredible swordplay, not fakery... wonderful dancers... the performance always ended with the cast doing elaborate ensemble dances as well as individual specialties... and expert instrumentalists or singers... the play began with a concert lasting about half an hour.  All this in addition to being able to play well a variety of parts (including several parts in the same performance) on very short notice and with very short preparation.<br /><br />Prof. Chute is sound and grounded about many aspects of Shakespeare's life that lead other biographers to wild surmises.  I suspect she is about the only biographer to understand how Shakespeare's marriage worked.  No matter how much you have read about Shakespeare, you will find many new insights and perspectives in this book.	2004-08-09

If you are looking for a thick book about actor/director Clint Eastwood's life and career, illustrated with some unusual photos, then this will fill the bill.  If you want an objective biography of Eastwood, together with an objective analysis of his film work, this is not the book you want.  Schickel was basically an employee and friend of Eastwood during the researching and writing of the book, and he tends to ignore or downplay the dark side of Eastwood's activities, particularly his alleged \\"women are like kleenex\\" philosophy, and his alleged cruelty toward former collaborators.<br /><br />The long book is made longer by merciless padding, including detailed and completely unnecessary plot summaries of the films.<br /><br />Viewed from 2004, Clint Eastwood is an important actor--- as good an actor as Jimmy Stewart and as iconic an actor as John Wayne. He is also an important and stylish director, and justifiably famous for his gentle ways with cast and crew, as well as his efficiency in coming in under budget.  One of the author's continuing themes, brought up on nearly every page, turns upon  the consistent misunderstanding of Eastwood, both as actor and director, by two generations of famous mainstream film critics.  This theme wears thin quickly when one realizes that there is probably not a single case in which famous mainstream film critics have had the slightest clue as to the value, importance and significance of any new film or film star.<br /><br />Eastwood is an important figure in 20th Century cinema, and he deserves an objective, scholarly, independently-researched analysis of all aspects of his life and career.  I don't know of one... we'll keep looking.	2004-08-09

At the dawning age of network television, DuMont was at least a player in the struggle to create programming that America's households would tune their newly purchased TVs into, in 1949, but by 1953 they were pretty much licked, and by the spring of 1955 they were out of the picture completely and literally.<br />Based on Weinstein's carefully researched and well-organized recounting of the history of DuMont, it is amazing that the network lasted as long as it did.  The two major networks, NBC and CBS, had powerful lobbyists who would walk right into the offices of the FCC or the halls of Congress and unashamedly dictate regulations or rulings or legislation that openly favored<br />NBC and CBS, while making it difficult for ABC and impossible for DuMont to expand.  ABC survived by forging strong ties to Hollywood studios, but an earlier alliance between DuMont and Paramount was nothing but complete disaster for DuMont. In fact, just about everything was a disaster for DuMont... they were even screwed horrendously by AT&amp;T on coax cable rental fees.<br />DuMont had no money, but they did have creativity, born of genuinely bare necessity. Director of Programming James Caddigan and a bunch of people often literally hired off the street came up with innovative programming ideas which can now be seen to have shaped the direction of all network television programming in the decades to come.  Yet even here, DuMont was doomed to lose.  Once they had hold of a hot thing, they never had the money to develop it properly, or to retain the performers involved under contract.<br />Weinstein devotes the first three chapters of this roughly 220-page book to the rise and fall of Allan B. Du Mont as manufacturer and (disinterested) network head.  He then turns to the areas in which DuMont's plow first broke the plains, with chapters on daytime TV programming aimed at housewives; on CAPTAIN VIDEO, the first and maybe the greatest of the live space adventure series of television's Golden Age; on DuMont's first successful variety host, Morey Amsterdam; and on its first superstar, Jackie Gleason.  Also covered are DuMont's two popular and pioneering police procedural dramas; its surprisingly<br />successful venture into religious programming, with the charismatic and sinister Bishop Fulton J. Sheen; as well as an experiment with late-night programming guided by comic genius Ernie Kovacs.<br />Often in reading books on TV of the early 1950s one quickly realizes that the author's knowledge of the programs is entirely due to having read a few  TV-Guide-type articles on the programs, from that era... in other words, he hasn't a clue.  Weinstein, born in 1967, was well aware of this pitfall and he has made an energetic effort to locate and view kinescopes of presumably typical broadcasts of  each of the programs he discusses.  As a result, he can describe  in detail the unique signatures that DuMont's always low budget and  often great creativity brought to their successful series.<br />The book is carefully footnoted, nicely indexed, and professionally bound and printed.  Misprints are very few.  One of the strangest is the replacement of the word &quot;sight&quot; by &quot;site&quot; in a few inappropriate spots! Recommended to anyone who remembers the heady and heroic days of the Golden Age of Television, or is curious about it.lden Age; on DuMont's first successful variety host, Morey Amsterdam; and on its first superstar, Jackie Gleason.

Of the four authors, there are two much funnier and nastier than the remaining two, and so about half the book's contents fall somewhat flat.  You will have better luck dipping into the book at random rather than trying to read it straight through.<br />The Bush II Whitehouse is such an indescribably strange place that I am not sure the reality is not far stranger than the parodies found here.  No presidential administration within my fairly long memory (going back to FDR) has been so completely and blatantly a captive of big business and the craziest elements of the far-right, or has dared to adopt a foreign policy based on simple, naked and unprovoked agression against weak nations with oil.  Nor have we had a previous president so completely disinterested in and ignorant of the world around him, unless you want to go all the way back to Warren G. Harding. In short, we have a situation where you have to laugh to keep from crying, and this book does help a lot to find some laughs amidst the tears.	2004-03-16

Her characters are absolutely and purely ignorant of  virtually any and all aspects of human culture, human civilization or human achievement. Their conversation reveals no inkling of what year it is, or what state they are in, much less what nation or planet they are on. In the real world these creatures would have spent the last 50 years glued to the front of the boob tube, and essentially their entire conversation would be devoted to soap operas, talk shows and televised sports.<br />Yet apart from a few vague references to a \\"remote,\\" or the \\"five o'clock news,\\" there is little evidence anyone even has a TV... much less reads a (non-local) newspaper or books, fiction or nonfiction. [Hope, who runs the local bookstore, does seem to know who Thirkell and Wodehouse are.]<br />For quite a few years Karon has been mining the vein of \\"non-books\\" diligently, rather than supplying new \\"adventures\\" (to use the word very loosely) for Father Tim and his fellow prisoners. This is finally the 6th Mitford novel (despite what the publisher claims), and takes over roughly where A NEW SONG left off. As we join the team, Father Tim and wife are getting ready to spend a year living in a tent in Goatbugger, Tennessee doing something the author never bothers to specify, because it is obvious to both author and reader that Tim ain't gonna get there (what would become of Violet, for example!).  Instead Tim, in his customary mindless way, manages to seriously injure himself and another minister, and spends the rest of the novel in a deep, brooding depression. It's not that Tim is communing with his inner thoughts, because like all the other characters, HE HAS NO THOUGHTS!  And that makes this novel very rough going, to say the least.<br />As another reviewer noted on these pages, \\"pray\\" is almost the only verb in the book, and it seemingly appears about 5 times per page.  Otherwise, nothing happens.  There is some nonsense about a lunatic who wants to build a log cabin the size of a cathedral, or maybe a cathedral the size of a log cabin, his raving being unclear on this point; continuing villain Edith Mallory  makes her customary pointless appearance; Father Tim gets a computer and goes online so he can read his own e-mail; some ex-cons need the good Father's support; one of Dooley's missing brothers turns out to have, gosh, been right there all along; and that's pretty much the size of it. About the only suspense concerns whether or not incidental characters Hope and Helene will become regular church attendees and I wouldn't dream of spoiling that for you!<br />Rumors are afoot that in a later novel in the series, Father Tim will encounter for the first time in his life a Muslim, or a Hindu, or a Jew, or a Catholic, or a university professor, or a scientist,  or even an uppity knee-grow, and expire from shock and heart-failure.

Nor is the author, pulp veteran E. Hoffmann Price, a man of much intelligence or discernment--- at one point he proudly tells us how he advised a friend who needed immediate surgery to correct a life-treatening condition not to have it, because &quot;the stars were wrong!&quot;  Fortunately, the friend ignored Price's astrological advice.<br />However, Price is the only man to have met personally and spent considerable time with all three of the titans of WEIRD TALES, H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, during their heyday as pulp writers, and he can and does uniquely offer first-hand, fairly vivid (if frustrating) word portraits of these immortal creators.  The book is filled out with a number of other similar portraits of fictioneers, such as Henry Kuttner, August Derleth and Edmond Hamilton, and even Price's favorite Turkish rug dealer. There are also attached some vaguely related essays by Price, and a useful bibliography of Price's literary output.<br />Price's general cluelessness and lack of perspective often results in some rich, unintended humor, as in his blandly told tale of a friend and colleague who graduated from the pulps to become a successful novelist and screenwriter, who was also a dedicated Communist, who spent  years in Russia and took courses in Marxist philosophy at Moscow State University, and who upon return to the US immediately got a job as screenwriter with the Walt Disney Studios!<br />Price spends a huge amount of space scolding his friend H. P. Lovecraft for viewing fiction writing as a private art rather than a cash-earning profession, and he takes every opportunity to ridicule the overweight, semiliterate, cultureless Lovecraft fanboys of the 1970s.  But, of course, obnoxious fans aside, it is precisely Lovecraft's commitment to art that makes him the best-known of all WEIRD TALES' regular contributors, and the only one who will ever be conceivably of interest within the towers of  academia.gular contributors, and the only one who will ever be conceivably of interest within the towers of  academia.	2003-12-23

As if to demonstrate<br />over and over that truth is stranger than fiction, few if any writers could<br />have invented anyone even vaguely like the real Lewis, from whose viewpoint we<br />observe the people and events leading up to, and following, the<br />Lincoln Assassination.  Nor would anyone dream up a villain like the<br />real one we encounter here... a viciously sadistic, opium-smoking necrophile who kept<br />the corpses of his wife and daughter sealed in his home for years, who<br />was reputed to have been driven raving mad by the suicide of his brother, and<br />who despite all this was Lincoln's Secretary of War... Edwin Stanton!<br />The historical framework is fairly straightforward: fading actor John Wilkes<br />Booth gathers about him a ragtag bunch of losers, and plots to kidnap<br />Lincoln and spirit him off to the capitol city of the Confederacy.<br />Lewis automatically becomes a member of the bunch, as the<br />general factotum, lover and &quot;paid companion&quot; of Booth.  When it becomes clear that Booth's group could no more<br />stage a successful kidnapping than they could fly to the moon by<br />flapping their arms, Booth sends his tiny group by ones and twos<br />to launch roughly simultaneous attacks on Federal officials, while<br />Booth himself shoots Lincoln in Ford's Theater.  The only other planned attack<br />which actually takes place is Lewis's, on the Secretary of State, Seward.<br />But as soon as the &quot;conspirators,&quot; including several innocent bystanders<br />such as Lewis's sometime landlady and a medical doctor who treated Booth,<br />fall into the hands of Stanton, the real nightmare begins, and Merlin and<br />Russo don't spare the reader.  Stanton outdoes himself in devising<br />the most fiendish conceivable tortures for the prisoners, their trials are a sham, the verdicts being written out<br />before the trials start, and the ultimate horror is reserved for the<br />end--- the hanging of Lewis has a totally  unexpected aspect that is almost<br />unendurable even for the hardened Civil War veterans who witness it... many<br />of whom faint, vomit, or run screaming from the prison courtyard!<br />The novel is full of minor characters about whom history does not preserve much<br />information. Jan Merlin, with his sure actor's instinct, brings even<br />the smallest parts to life.  A long appendix gives the actual eloquent final defense<br />of Lewis, as provided by his lawyer, W. E. Doster.  Print-on-demand books<br />are usually a seething sea of misprints, but I found few in this edition.<br />Recommended.landlady and a medical doctor who treated Booth,<BR>fall into the hands of Stanton, the real nightmare begins, and Merlin and<BR>Russo don't spare the reader.

(&quot;Autie&quot;) Custer is<br />fairly well-written and researched, but it breaks no new ground.<br />It devotes much more time to Custer's Civil War career than<br />to his latter days as an Indian Fighter.  And it is fairly<br />clear that as soon as Custer leaves the Civil War behind, the<br />author's interest declines very sharply.  Convincing and<br />telling details vanish from the book at this point,<br />as well as any kind of immediacy or vividness, and too<br />often we get vague generalities about some document when we<br />need direct quotes.<br />We learn a good deal about Custer as the &quot;Boy General&quot; leading<br />the &quot;Wolverines&quot; to victory after victory.  We learn surprisingly<br />little about Custer as leader of the 7th Cavalry. In particular,<br />Custer's relationships with his fellow officers and with the<br />enlisted men who served under him are exceedingly germane to what<br />happened to the 7th at the Little Big Horn.  A biography that<br />fails to give this kind of background, in detail, simply fails as<br />a biography.	2003-10-04

I don't like the<br />words \\"skeptic\\" and \\"dictionary\\" in the title (the \\"the\\" is<br />ok!).  The tone is not skeptical, it is simply fact-oriented.<br />And the book is in encylopedia format, not dictionary format.<br />Now as to content.  The author is a professor of philosophy, and<br />he tends to discuss the various topics from the standpoint<br />of logical and factual consistency, rather than from a scientific<br />standpoint.  Since the topics under discussion generally have<br />no scientific aspects whatsoever, despite their pretenses, this<br />is hardly a defect.  Entries tend to be a bit brief and terse,<br />as might be expected since most of the material appeared first<br />on the author's very useful website.  I teach a course in<br />pseudoscience, and it covers a very, very wide range of topics<br />in this nearly bottomless field.  I found accurate entries<br />on almost every one of those topics here, with very few<br />exceptions.<br />Discussion of medical quackery is always problematical in a book<br />of this kind, because of the tendency of quacks to sue authors,<br />not on the issue of false claims about the quack, but rather<br />on the narrow legal issue of \\"restraint of trade\\"--- in other<br />words, factual discussion of quacks and alternative healers<br />makes it harder for those quacks and alternative healers to find<br />paying suckers, or so their lawyers claim.  But the author has<br />managed to discuss many common forms of quackery, and a number<br />of prominent quacks, nonetheless.  More power to him and to<br />his publisher.<br />I don't know of another book exactly like this, with the same<br />broad  sweep of content.  I recommend it highly to anyone who is<br />interested in the facts, if any, behind some of the most<br />familiar myths of our time.	2003-08-24

First-time novelist David Pirie deserves kudos for doing<br />something a little different along the lines of a Sherlock<br />Holmes pastiche.  His characters are Dr. Bell and Conan Doyle<br />themselves.  On the other hand, he runs off the rails pretty<br />early on, with a perfervid yet elliptical style that is more<br />along the lines of Anna Katherine Green than Dr. Watson, and<br />with (oh, no, not again!) standard pastiche plot B.<br />There is no chemistry (or even friendship) between Dr. Bell and<br />Dr. Conan Doyle, and their cases--- &quot;real life&quot; incidents that<br />are close parallels to Holmes-Watson adventures such as<br />&quot;The Speckled Band&quot; and &quot;The Solitary Cyclist&quot;--- tend to<br />be more annoying or unsatisfying than interesting.<br />The usual problem with standard pastiche plot B is that the<br />behavior of a central character is necessarily totally<br />inconsistent with his actual aims--- here the problem is<br />magnified, since there are at least three and maybe four<br />characters whose behavior throughout the &quot;adventure&quot; makes no<br />sense whatsoever in terms of their eventually-revealed<br />motivations.<br />Conan Doyle's overheated style continually sets the reader up<br />for &quot;a revelation more terrifying than mere mortal flesh can<br />endure,&quot; and then follows up with, more often than not,<br />no payoff at all, or a payoff that amounts to an empty<br />pay envelope.  At the end of the very episodic &quot;novel,&quot; Dr.<br />Conan Doyle hints that in the next adventure, we'll encounter<br />Jack the Ripper (whom CD and Bell have seemingly matched wits<br />with years before during Watson's medical school days).<br />It's a promising setup, but we've been burned so often in<br />the present book, I wonder if it is worth checking out the next<br />in line.	2003-05-24
US	51320059	R1ZMY18RQBI52S	0843950684	573496288	Curtains of Blood	Books	2	8	10	N	N	Amateurish and undeveloped	Bram Stoker and Jack the Ripper, together again for the first time?  Sounds promising, but this rather short novel goes nowhere with the concept.  The Ripper consults Stoker several times for no reason that makes sense, and Stoker is--- we are told---  simultaneously fascinated by the Ripper as a prototype of the vampiric Count who is just beginning to take nebulous shape in his notes and imagination, but nothing that Stoker actually does or says, or that the Ripper says or does, in any way reflects this.<br />All the characters, whether named Stoker, Conan Doyle, or Oscar Wilde, speak in almost precisely the same voice, and with a 1990s US rather than 1880s British vocabulary.  Stoker, again for no reason that makes any real sense, starts out as a self-appointed detective hoping to &quot;solve&quot; the Ripper killings, quickly has a red herring dragged across the trail as he fears his idol and mentor Sir Henry Irving is the guilty party, and then abandons his investigation completely not quite halfway through the novel. The Ripper himself never actually steps onto the stage, and we learn basically nothing about him other than that he might feel a kind of spiritual kinship to old Vlad Tepes himself.<br />Basically, it's a tease and a cheat, a sort of outline of a novel that seemed to hit writer's block fairly early on.  There is no sense of time or place, the characters are interchangeable, and nothing whatsoever happens within the framework of the novel other than the historical events we know so well, and which have nothing whatsoever to do with Bram Stoker.<br />I'd say, give this one a miss.	2003-01-02

Jan Merlin told me not long ago that he had been fascinated by Africa since the age of 5, when he heard tales of the continent from a sea-roving uncle. I'd have known that without being told, from this unique work of literature, which evokes what it was like to safari in Africa in the mid-19th Century with truly extraordinary vividness.<br />The author's \\"voice\\" allows us to saturate ourselves in the colors, textures, odors, sounds and sensations of a trek through wildest Africa.  In about 60 years of reading novels, I've never encountered anything quite like this, in terms of transporting the reader far from the here-and-now, into a long-vanished world whose every feature is alien, yet recognizably human. [Think of the seagoing adventures of Patrick O'Brien, and you still won't quite have the immediacy of the work at hand.]<br />The novel also tries to do justice to a long-forgotten historical figure, the explorer Speke, whose untimely death and sometimes-vicious rivalry with the much-more-famous Richard Burton have conspired to cheat him of almost all credit for his incredible exploits and endurance.<br />But the character you won't soon forget is the narrator, another actual historical figure, \\"Bombay.\\"  From the first line of the first page, Bombay offers a vocabulary and a viewpoint totally  unique to English literature.  Think of Huckleberry Finn, and you won't even be halfway there!<br />This new edition of a work previously published in 1999 is now split into two volumes and is  also far more professionally printed than the earlier edition.

Here's the first paperback edition of a Holmes and Watson pastiche from 1994, and a very nice one it is, too.  Roberts gets the Conan Doyle style, and the dialogue of Holmes and Watson, dead-on in a way American authors don't seem to be able to manage. [His dialogue for American characters is notably less successful, however!]<br />It's 1906 and a retired Holmes and vacationing Watson are dragged into investigation of two mysterious railway accidents--- the accidents, and many characters Holmes and Watson meet in the course of their investigation are actual and historical, by the way.  However, the investigation incredibly drags on for seven long years(!), before the maniac responsible is brought to justice.<br />During the course of the investigation Mycroft and a close relative of The Woman play key roles.  And the events of &quot;His Last Bow&quot; actually occur within the confines of this novel.<br />For my taste, Holmes here comes across as a bit slow on the uptake, but after all he's been retired for quite a while, and there are semi-plausible Reasons why he is unable to devote his full energies to the case.<br />I've lost track of the number of pastiches I have read in the past 10 years, but this one ranks quite high among that group.

This is the fifth pastiche I have seen by Barry Day, and it has the merits and defects of the previous four.  Good points: without slavishly imitating the Doylean style, and also without the direct quotations that lesser writers tend to lean upon, he still manages to get the Holmes/Watson dialogue in a more than acceptable facsimile of the originals.<br />Bad points:  Here we have two plots that really have nothing to do with one another.  A maniac is methodically killing one by one the seven members of a long-forgotten collegiate club. But wait, there's more: the high priestess of a mystical Cobra Cult in an Asian never-never land is on the track of a long-lost sacred book, which is believed to be in the possession of one unknown member of the club.  The identity of the maniac is obvious both to the reader and to Holmes about 1/4 of the way through the book, but he is inexplicably allowed to run around loose for the remainder of the book until enough pages have been chalked up that it is ok to have him killed off.  (By the way, about half way through the book he is shot and wounded by Watson, but nothing is ever made of this, and the next time he shows up he seems to be in fine fettle.)  As for the Cobra Cult, it never really has anything whatsoever to do with anything that transpires, except in providing the lovely high priestess for Watson to describe repeatedly, and admire--- recovery of the sacred book turns out to be a non-issue.<br />The killer has no real motive for his murders (he is said to be \\"insane\\" every once in a while as if this explains everything) other than perhaps festering envy of his more successful fellow-students (who include Mycroft).  Holmes has no real excuse for letting the villain run around loose, other than to fill out 187 pages and get us to novel, as opposed to short story, length. You may find it difficult, as well, to find an excuse to read this particular pastiche. If you have read previous Day pastiches, you'll pretty much know what to expect.  I got through it, but without noticable enthusiasm.hat to expect.  I got through it, but without noticable enthusiasm.	2002-12-10

I happened to purchase this novel and the author's previous Holmes effort, CHRONICLES OF THE MISSING YEARS, simultaneously.  That was fortunate, because if I had purchased  and read COTMY first, I would never have purchased another novel by this author, and so would have missed out on this one.<br />In short, this pastiche has everything that the first novel lacked: plot, vivid characters and characterizations, continual new developments and unexpected incidents.  There's a good, scenery-chewing villain, Von Stein, and plenty of frantic action, as various secret agents practice the double- and triple-cross.  As in any novel which mixes Holmes into WWI, there's not a lot of opportunity for Holmes to be Holmes--- instead, he's a rather elderly, but still spry action hero.<br />The novel's only liability is the return of a preposterous character from CHRONICLES, among whose many absurdly exaggerated abilities is that of being in two widely-separated locations at what is apparently the same instant, both timewise and plotwise. It is also a bit disappointing not to have Watson around, and further to be left at novel's end with no clear indication as to the current status of Mycroft Holmes.<br />If you don't mind some bending of the willow, you'll probably enjoy this adventure of Holmes in the middle East during the height of WWI.	2002-06-22

Apparently there is a whole narrow genre of Sherlock Holmes pastiches known to its fans as \\"Sherlockian Romances,\\" in which the Great Detective is (against all the Canon) matched with some supposedly appropriate female. ...Well, in the present book we have Holmes saddled with a young woman who is (we are told on just about every page) so incredibly beautiful and so impossibly unsocial that she is irresistable to Holmes, who against all reason takes her off with him when escaping from the Reichenbach Falls and Moriarty's two henchmen. After three years of wandering the world, during which absolutely nothing of interest happens, Holmes returns to Baker Street and installs Elizabeth Sigerson as \\"Mrs. Sigerson,\\" his personal secretary!  The plot jumps abruptly to 1903 and some totally preposterous antics involving Col. Sebastian Moran.  We are told that Watson, Lestrade, etc., never mention Elizabeth during all the post-Reichenbach pre-retirement period lest someone should try to distract Holmes by kidnapping or threatening Elizabeth.  Why they couldn't do the same by attacking or kidnapping Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Billy, Wiggins, etc.... well, don't ask!<br />In the whole novel there is not a single character (including Holmes) who comes to life even for an instant.  There is no plot, and all the characters, including Holmes,  behave in a way both inexplicable and imbecilic.  [For example, although we are told on every page that Elizabeth is so impossibly beautiful, etc., see above, that no man or woman can take his eyes off her, Holmes and Elizabeth waddle mindlessly and undisguised through Europe, always amazed when Moriarty's men track them down or trap them.]<br />The author's imagination runs pretty much on empty as far as  having Holmes be away from Baker Street for three years, so for two of them Holmes and Elizabeth do nothing but tend goats and have wild, crazy nightly sex in an isolated Tibetan village.  Holmes hikes to Lhasa, looks in at Mecca, and fiddles with coal-tar derivatives in France only because these are markers from the Canon, not because this novel's character would be motivated to do such.<br />Despite all the problems, I must say that Ms. Cooper-Posey is a competent writer.  I kept turning the pages despite the lack of intellectual stimulation, lack of character development, and lack of any plot whatsoever.  However, at the end, I must say that the total sum of enjoyment I experienced was quite small, and that the total burden of mild outrage at the way my time and interest had been taken advantage of was noticable.coal-tar derivatives in France only because these are markers from the Canon, not because this novel's character would be motivated to do such.  <br />Despite all the problems, I must say that Ms. Cooper-Posey is a competent writer.

The Goldrups have self-published three thick volumes, each containing 40 to 50 interviews, since the mid 1980s.<br />Here, in their fourth volume, they turn their attention to actors whose film careers began in childhood.  As in the previous three volumes, the interviewers are unobtrusive, and let the actors speak almost entirely for themselves. Unlike the previous three volumes, which were marred by huge numbers of grammatical and formatting errors, this one seems to have undergone some proofreading.  The proofreader seems to poop out about 3/4 of the way along, but the results remain fairly intelligible throughout.<br />Of the 39 actors interviewed, I'd guess that the names of only a handful would be familiar to any given reader.  Some performers made only two or three films, while others continued active for decades.  All tend to have very mixed feelings about their film careers.  The interviewers have two or three standard questions that they raise at the end of each interview, eliciting responses concerning \\"funny things that happened during filming,\\" \\"dangerous stunts you were involved in,\\" and \\"would you do it over again, knowing what you know now, and would you let your own child or grandchild get involved in the ways you were?\\"<br />Each interview is fascinating in its own way, and each also offers a look, through the eyes of a child, at many a world-famous actor whom the child worked with.  Considering the stories one hears today about the monster egos of the fairly minimally talented \\"stars\\" we have around in 2002, it comes as a refreshing counterbalance to hear how genuinely nice and down-to-earth some of the best known stars of the 1930s and 1940s were.

This time around, editor Joshi has turned up little-known tales by familiar authors such as Blackwood and Machen, and even less well known tales by authors who'd rarely be suspected of such work, such as Edith Nesbit and H. L. Mencken.  The overall literary standards are fairly high, with only two real bummers in the lot.<br />We begin with \\"ghost\\" tales by Arthur Quiller-Crouch, William Sharp, Robert Hichens (an interesting tale spoiled by being precisely two times too long!), Lafcadio Hearn, and Walter de la Mare. The ghost is a very problematical concept, internally contradictory--- an immaterial spirit could not be seen nor could it affect the waking world--- and almost guaranteed to lead the author artistically astray.  Most of these tales do not avoid that trap, although one does not involve a ghost at all.<br />Next are some \\"haunted places\\" explored by W. W. Astor, Violet Hunt and James Hopper.  The last of these tales suggests that the afterlife is to be spent attending the same school one attended as a child--- whether the experience was bliss or torture.<br />Next come \\"weird creatures,\\" depicted by Gautier, Bierce, and W. F. Harvey.  The best of these is Gautier's tale of the foot of the mummy of a lovely Egyptian princess... and with the foot in hand, guess who's not far behind.<br />Next we encounter \\"the superhuman,\\" with tales by LeFanu, Barry Pain, Edith Nesbit (an excellent mad-scientist adventure!), H. L. Mencken (with a plot that would have made a good early 1940s Bela Lugosi movie) and Thomas Burke.<br />The low point of the collection is found in \\"terror of fantasy,\\" with the contributions by Erckmann-Chatrian and Gertrude Atherton descending to depths of pure, mindless idiocy rarely encountered even in supernatural fiction.<br />Things pick up again with \\"cosmic terror,\\" which contains a moving poem in prose by Lord Dunsany, a cautionary tale about the dangers of \\"knowing too much\\" by Blackwood, a short tale that contemplates the total destruction of the earth with what is probably the only possible dignified attitude, from J.

Holmesians are well aware that the ending of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" is highly unsatisfactory for both Holmes and the King of Bohemia, whom Irene Adler, his former lover, is in an excellent  position to blackmail.  In his latest Holmes pastiche, John Hall takes this situation up again about a year after the events of \\"Scandal.\\"  Irene Norton says she needs to consult Holmes, but vanishes on the way to 221B Baker Street.  Apparently kidnapped and left to die, Norton is rescued by Holmes and Watson... but her account of the new situation that threatens the King and herself is highly unsatisfactory and probably pretty close to an outright lie.  Instead of refusing to take the case, as Conan Doyle's consulting detective always did when faced with a client who refused to explain the real situation, Holmes and Watson wind up in Bohemia in what is pretty certain to be a wild-goose chase, and  both Holmes and Watson bumble in some pretty inexplicable ways, with Watson coming perilously close to being a comical sidekick more than once.  The quest to recover the famous letters and photo supposedly stolen from Irene Norton succeeds with ridiculous ease, considering the planless, gormless, painfully unintelligent approaches adopted by Holmes.  And then the fact that Mrs. Norton lied suddenly assumes deadly importance.<br />With the situation treated rather lightly by the author throughout, it was a jarring and unwelcome twist for this elderly and jaded reader when the adventure ended with the very abrupt deaths of five characters (two offstage), over only two pages, with one of the deceased certainly an innocent bystander!<br />Not one of Hall's better efforts, this goes on the bottom of the stack with TRAVELS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.  It gets three stars only because of the fine period writing style in which the improbable adventure is recounted.	2002-02-02

And he has written mysteries set in modern times.<br />He gets Watson's style and personality down quite well, and is enough of a Holmes scholar to have some real fun with byways of the Canon. In this novel it is 1903, Holmes and Watson don't see much of one another, and there are nasty doings at the little-known but ultra-prestigious Abbey School, where the most powerful men of the British Empire send their sons. A wealthy student has been expelled for a petty theft he obviously did not commit, and his expulsion is immediately followed by the mysterious death of a schoolmaster who has been previously overheard, by students, muttering about a &quot;shocking situation.&quot; When Holmes is asked to take the case, the faculty stonewall him totally, so he is forced to send Watson in disguise to fill in temporarily for the dead teacher of english, and to cast about for clues and information.<br />There are some deliberate echoes of &quot;The Priory School,&quot; a case said to have taken place just a few years earlier. The goals of the three revealed villains sound plausible to me, as deduced by Holmes, but they conveniently come to nasty ends before any confession, leaving certain plot points unresolved.<br />As usual in Breese books, misprints are very few. In fact, I noticed only one. On p. 19 the character named Watson Minor is called Watson Major. [There is a Major, but he is not in that scene.]<br />Here are 160 pages of Holmes and Watson that won't insult your intelligence, your literary standards, or your love of the characters.

Howard, all wrote verse but only Ashton Smith was taken seriously as a poet by the contemporary literary establishment.  Howard's manly Kiplingesque verse was written largely for his own amusement, and HPL's was almost entirely confined to his days of activity in the Amateur Press movement (1914-22).<br />Most of HPL's verse is in an archaic, highly artifical late 18th Century or &quot;Georgian&quot; mode, which he had come to love from the books he found in his grandfather's library as a child.  He sometimes writes in the manner of Poe, but almost always to parody.  Actually, his most effective verse, like &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth,&quot; is in the sonnet form--- a form he rarely used.  Editor Joshi says this is &quot;complete,&quot; and he means it, down to birthday card inscriptions and one or two line fragments found among HPL's papers.  But this almost guarantees a low average of literary quality and interest.  Most educated men in the early 19th Century composed verses on occasion.  I have seen a photo of Einstein playing violin with a father and son on piano and violin.  Einstein inscribed the photo (in German), &quot;Here's to the father and his lad.  Our music was--- not bad!&quot;  Imagine someone collecting all such Einsteinian greetings and publishing them as THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF EINSTEIN.  Einstein would be horrified, and so should you be.  Should we be equally horrified by this book, which is not so different?  I think not, because HPL is an important literary figure, and after all some of the material collected herein is seriously intended--- but not much.<br />A lot of the verse consists of gentle kidding of friends in the AP movement, particularly HPL's teenage buddy Alfred Galpin.  There is even a mock-Elizabethan blank verse play in which Galpin and other figures of the AP have prominent roles, including HPL himself. One of the most astonishing of these works is &quot;Medusa: A Portrait,&quot; several pages of inventive vituperation aimed at a female enemy of HPL's.<br />Most readers will spend most of their time with HPL's &quot;Fantasy and Horror&quot; verse, which takes up about 60 pages of this mammoth 557-page time.  Given the interest many rock musicians take in HPL it is surprising more of this material has not been set to music.  A quick search of the Internet did reveal some posted MP3s of precisely such--- I didn't sample them but did notice the titles chosen were often the ones I'd also have chosen for that purpose.<br />This is a book to keep by the side of the bed and read a few pages in every time cats get you up to be let in or out, or a loud jalopy going by jolts you awake.  I think that's about the only way to get through it.orks is &quot;Medusa: A Portrait,&quot; several pages of inventive vituperation aimed at a female enemy of HPL's.<br />Most readers will spend most of their time with HPL's &quot;Fantasy and Horror&quot; verse, which takes up about 60 pages of this mammoth 557-page time.

US	51320059	R30L7K7FAVMGBX	0451204255	8719102	The Mike Hammer Collection, Volume 2: One Lonely Night, The Big Kill, Kiss Me Deadly	Books	4	32	33	N	N	Hitting his stride...	In the first three Mike Hammer novels, Mickey Spillane was learning as he went.  Here he's pretty much hitting his stride, in novels 4, 5 and 6.  These are the quintessential Hammer outings. Spillane has borrowed two basic plot devices from earlier genres.  From silent serials he has borrowed &quot;the weenie,&quot; as Pearl White called it... a missing item that all the characters are frantically searching for, and all the bad guys think the hero knows the wereabouts of.  From the DOC SAVAGE pulp novels of Lester Dent he has borrowed the idea of a master criminal who somehow finds the time, in innocuous guise, to pal around helpfully with our hero in his quest to solve the mystery.  The fun of each novel is in seeing how Spillane mixes these ingredients.<br />ONE LONELY NIGHT begins and ends on a deserted New York City bridge in a snowstorm.  At the beginning, Hammer is involved in a murder and suicide. At the end, he kills the villain with his bare hands and leaves his cooling corpse to be covered in snow!  In between, Hammer is mixed up with palpably evil Communist Party USA members and the agate-eyed NKVD killers who keep them in line. [The novel was written at the height of McCarthy-era paranoia.] Added to the mix are missing plans of the latest US secret weapon, and a universally loved political figure who says he's being blackmailed by his identical twin brother, an escaped lunatic!  At the very end there's an amazing if implausible identity switch that is a variant of the one at the end of VENGEANCE IS MINE.<br />In THE BIG KILL, Hammer winds up having to care for a 1-year-old orphaned boy, while trying to solve the puzzle of who killed the boy's father, and why.  Not only is the DA on Hammer's case big time, but kingpins of a city-wide gambling and vice racket seem extraordinarily nervous about who has possession of some unknown documents that the DA is desperate to obtain.  You'd guess the identity of Hammer's secret adversary long before Hammer does, if the inside front cover blurb didn't give it away already! Action is nicely integrated by having almost all the novel's events occur during heavy rain showers.<br />Since Hammer is in all three novels engaged to marry his lovely assistant Velda, you'd think sex with strangers would take a back seat in these adventures, and to some extent it does, particularly in the last of the three novels, KISS ME, DEADLY, in which Hammer does little more than to gaze appreciatively at the hot babes he encounters.  To make up for no sex, Spillane escalates the violence tremendously.  I lost count of the number of Mafia goons that Hammer kills, usually  with his bare hands, when opportunity presents.  The goons return the favor by beating Hammer to a pulp at least twice, torturing one girl to death and getting a good start on doing the same to Velda!  Oddly among Spillane's usually tightly constructed plots, there are some major loose ends at the end of KISS ME, DEADLY.<br />Every one of these is a classic.  Spillane's novels hurtle along at a breathless pace... and they're addictive, as you'll see if you sample this great bargain of a collection.he inside front cover blurb didn't give it away already!

US	51320059	R3UWCOSETLL0IZ	1569715769	327725773	Blast Off! Rockets, Robots, Ray Guns, and Rarities from the Golden Age of Space Toys	Books	2	2	10	N	N	A Boomer Bust!	If you're in the market for a poorly-written, poorly-illustrated and carelessly researched introduction to the space toys of the period stretching from the late 1920s to 1957, look no further, this is it.<br />The first problem is that the three authors never seem to make up their minds what the book is about. Is it about the toys themselves?  Is it about the collectors of these toys?  Is it about the media (comic strips, TV shows) that inspired the toys?  Or is it about the manufacturers of the toys?  There's a little bit of everything, so nothing is ever really satisfactory. I doubt that people buy books like this to read the text, but know that the lumbering, leaden, styleless and graceless text found here is a real chore to read.<br />Books like this live or die on the quality of their illustrations, and this one falls down as badly on the photos as it does in the<br />accompanying text.  Nearly half the photos of toys are amateurishly underexposed--- these typically have a dozen items spread out on a tabletop lit by a single key light, directed at the center or even worse at one far edge.  The 20% of the tabletop inside the circle of light is exposed properly; the further from the tiny circle of light the items are, the more they vanish into total darkness!  [A typical photo of Tom Corbett accessories, on p. 144, has only a single item, a phone set, visible in the spotlight while 5 to 7 other items are cast into outer darkness.]  The standards of photography on other recent, similar books, such as Gene Metcalf's great picture-book on rayguns, are incredibly high.  Much of the photography here would be unacceptable even by mediocre amateur standards.<br />Even the photo captions are often annoying.  About half of them are written in a (...) sarcastic tone that you might remember being one of many unpleasant characteristics of the (...) Bart Simpson clone you tried to stay away from in 5th grade.<br />As for contents, Chapter 1 introduces space toys in a lumbering humanities-professorial-style text complete with many irrelevant quotes from \\"historians\\" and \\"sociologists.\\"  Chapter 2 is devoted to Buck Rogers toys, mainly from the 1930s, including flying helmets and chemistry sets.  [Or more precisely it is devoted to a single Buck Rogers collector, and his incredible collection. In many ways this is the most interesting chapter in the book.] Chapter 3 mysteriously is devoted to Flash Gordon, though he inspired few toys.  Chapter 4 is devoted to Archer Plastics, the company that produced the most familiar space toys of the early 1950s, including the wonderful winged V-2-style space ship, and some much less wonderful spacemen (and women, and kids).<br />Chapter 5 mainly recounts the puzzle of  the origin of the beautifully designed \\"Pyro\\" space ships, X-100 through X-400, which seem to have appeared simultaneously in the US, England and Europe. Chapter 6 is devoted to toys tying into the early 1950s live space adventure programs, CAPTAIN VIDEO, TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET, and SPACE PATROL.  A number of genuine Space Hero experts were interviewed, such as Bob Burns and Ed Pippin, but they obviously didn't get to proofread the chapter, which is riddled with glaring errors. Chapter 7 is devoted to the huge line of British toys related to the weekly DAN DARE comic strip.  Chapter 8 is a grab-bag of random images which didn't fit anywhere else, including the Ralston Rocket and various slick magazine covers of the period with a space-toy-related theme... plus ray guns, plus play suits, plus space helmets, plus....  Finally, Chapter 9, which really seems to have wandered in from some other book, deals with an auction of a collection of 1950s wind-up Japanese robots at Sotheby's last year.  Apart from learning that collectors are both weird and ignorant (of the background of the toys they collect) we come away empty.<br />There are good things about this book, there are mediocre things about this book and there are awful things about this book.  Here's a case where you really need to thumb through the book at your local book store before deciding whether you need it or not.  If you decide you need it,  you can then go home and order it from Amazon (...).  I decided I needed itis book.

The Mickster honed his craft writing scripts for Fawcett Comics, and Mike Hammer's first incarnation was as a comic character, Mike Danger, but the first Hammer novel is still quite crude.  In I, THE JURY Hammer spends way too much print telling everyone how he is going to gun down the perp who offed his old Army buddy, and do it point blank and in cold blood, and that he can get away with it because he has a license to carry a pistol (?!?).  There are also subtly wrong word choices that often reminded me of Edward D. Wood, Jr.'s somewhat similar hard-boiled crime novels.  And the identity of the killer is obvious long before the  famous ending in which Hammer does shoot the unarmed perp point blank in the gut, because there is only one person situated so as to carry out all the crimes Hammer brings home to the villain.<br />MY GUN IS QUICK is a far better novel in all respects, better written, better plotted, but still has the defect that the identity of the criminal mastermind Hammer seeks is obvious almost from the first, since again only one character in the book could possibly be the guilty party.  It also has Hammer, despite the title, badly outdrawn by the bad guy and blasted down.<br />Spillane hits his stride in VENGEANCE IS MINE.  There's a complex plot, started with a murder committed under the very nose of the passed-out-drunk Hammer, and ending with Hammer gunning down the killer in a sequence that is literally twisted on its side compared to the similar sequence in I, THE JURY.  The action is integrated by occurring almost entirely during a heavy New York City snowstorm, and the identity of the killer is effectively disguised by having the obvious and apparently only suspect not turning out to be the guilty party.  In fact, in a touch we are told Spillane was very proud of, the actual identity of the brutal killer, who should be easy to spot because he is so physically powerful that he can break necks almost instantly with nothing but his bare hands, is concealed from the reader not only until the last line, but literally until the last WORD of the last line!  And, no, this word is not a character name!<br />Probably what made the Spillane novels best sellers in their day is that Hammer is continually meeting impossibly beautiful, impossibly desirable women who want to jump into bed with him (and usually do!)  almost the instant they set eyes on him.  What is not noticed as often is that Hammer operates with authentic 1950s morality--- if he plans to marry a girl, he doesn't lay a finger on her.  In the first novel, Hammer and his &quot;serious&quot; girl friend pretty much have to go sit on mounds of ice to avoid losing control and &quot;doing it&quot; before marriage, an unthinkable happening even to the hard-bitten Hammer!<br />Coming to this late, as I did, I notice how many touches that have become routine in hardboiled detective fiction must have originated with Hammer.  The similarities between Hammer and Andrew Vachss's justifiably paranoid private eye Burke are particularly striking, down to the battered car that conceals a gigantic, superpowerful engine and the gunning-down of unarmed bad guys when the opportunity permits.<br />As the introduction by Max Allen Collins notes, Spillane has garnered little literary respect or attention over the years. Like most true creators, his real legacy lies in the fact that he redefined a whole genre, and that all private eye novels to follow had to come to terms with his creation.of the brutal killer, who should be easy to spot because he is so physically powerful that he can break necks almost instantly with nothing but his bare hands, is concealed from the reader not only until the last line, but literally until the last WORD of the last line!

If you're new to the series, I might mention that Houdini himself functions largely as comic relief, parading<br />a giant ego as he  propounds a series of preposterous &quot;solutions&quot; that parody roughly contemporary detective literature, while his brother Dash acts quietly behind the scenes to solve the crime.  In every novel, Houdini, despite his mental shortcomings and giant ego, steps in to save a life with his exceptional physical prowess.<br />It's usually good fun and a good read, but for some reason in this latest outing, things fall apart badly about 3/4 of the way through, and the ending is almost a slap in the reader's face, with a completely preposterous &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery of a murderous spirit apparition, and so many loose ends that the main and most interesting character, Lucius Craig, is as much a mystery finally as he was initially.  Even the nature of the relation between Craig and his &quot;daughter,&quot; although it is the subject of considerable innuendo during the unfolding of the story, is not explored--- and even worse, the &quot;daughter,&quot; out of the blue and apparently as an afterthought, turns out to be in the novel's last couple of pages a person who will be one of Houdini's greatest real-life antagonists.<br />You see Harry and Dash here just before the end of the 19th Century, with Harry struggling, not so much to break into the big time, as to break into show business at any level.  But if you know anything about the real Houdini, it may come as a shock to have his mother speaking fluent, colloquial english to newspaper reporters!  Much of Stashower's research is good and thorough, especially as regards the &quot;inside&quot; of the spiritualism racket--- still going strong more than a century after the days in which this novel is set.  But while I can recommend the previous two novels in the series, I have some serious reservations about this entry.an recommend the previous two novels in the series, I have some serious reservations about this entry.	2001-11-07

What we have here are three short stories and a previously published novel, THE GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA, from 1975.<br />There are a surprising number of grammatical and punctuation errors, considering Boyer is a regularly-published novelist.  There are also a large number of misprints, but not an overwhelming number.<br />But about the contents.  The first story, &quot;Zolnay the Aerialist,&quot; is by far the worst--- if you know anything about Victorian England you will have figured out the plot in the first few pages, and then as you read you will hope against hope that that isn't really going to be the plot... but, alas, it is.  That the author himself is aware of something wrong here is indicated by his frantic waving to friends in the audience.<br />Things get much better with &quot;Bell Rock Light,&quot; concerning a murder on a Stevenson Lighthouse--- fascinating detail, and given the<br />lighthouse, any student of the Canon will be looking for the P and the TC, and they arrive in due course.<br />Also good is &quot;Eyrie Cliff,&quot; in which Holmes and Watson uncover a bevy of German Secret Agents, who plan to do away with a young genius of antisubmarine tactics.  There are a number of nice twists here to divert the reader's attention.<br />Finally we have a reprint of GIANT RAT OF SUMATRA. It has been so long since I read this (25 years!) that I had forgotten everything except the identity of the villain.  Reading it again, I find many too many echoes of HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (and why don't Watson and the villain therefore recognize Holmes' ploy instantly?) but otherwise a pretty good outing for the two old friends, and more than a touch of genuine, effective terror.<br />All in all, this is worthy of your attention and your money, if you can't get enough of the gaslit fogs of Baker Street and the doings of its immortal residents.	2001-10-24

I was delighted, pretty much, with the three long stories or short novels in this collection of Holmes pastiches.<br />Rubino really nails Watson's literary style, a very difficult trick that very few writers bring off even approximately.<br />In the first and most routine adventure, Holmes tackles the vanishing under strange circumstances of a priceless necklace. This was the least satisfying of the stories for me, not only because of  echoes from &quot;Naval Treaty,&quot; but also because it introduces characters like the odious Col. Moran prematurely as far as the Doylean Canon is concerned.<br />Far more interesting is the second tale, in which the staunchly Victorian Holmes must deal with a murder and disappearance involving London's most notorious abortionist and midwife, and his investigation uncovers a genuine monster, the &quot;abominable Merridew.&quot; In the third tale, Holmes must locate a missing heiress, but the real question is why this unknown girl is to be the inheritor of a huge fortune, when the dying man has a wife and son who are being  essentially disinherited by a very strange will. And just who is Holmes' client, anyway? Holmes reaches a solution just in time to forestall a cold-blooded murder.<br />The common theme of all three cases is that the villain is never brought to justice within the legal system, for one reason or another.  And each case is based on a very brief mention within the Doylean Canon, often a single name with no context.<br />I hope this is not the last pastiche from Jane Rubino.  As Holmes himself would say, &quot;Well done.&quot;	2001-10-15

I have enjoyed the previous three Barry Day Holmes pastiches, but I would have a hard time summarizing now what any of them were about, and the present volume continues the pattern of diverting but forgettable... but maybe not so forgettable as the previous entries.<br />The plot is a bit different: Jack the Ripper, a British nobleman sent into permanent exile as a result of his crimes, has slipped back into England and reappeared in public (with help from his own fortune and the Kaiser) as the leader of a religious cult. &quot;Janus Cain&quot; preaches the coming apocalypse, and intends to bring it on himself (at least as far as London is concerned) with the help of biological weapons and a small private army.<br />Who can stop him? Well, Holmes, Watson, THE woman and Oscar Wilde join forces to terminate &quot;Cain&quot; in the London sewers!  Day gets the relation between Holmes and Watson pretty much correct, but does not attempt to emulate Watson's literary style.  As is getting customary in modern pastiches, Holmes often seems a bit slow on the uptake.  Not much is made of &quot;Cain's&quot; past adventures as the Ripper, either... nor do we discover how a British Lord became so familiar with the sewers under Whitechapel.<br />The novel ends with Holmes and Watson getting ready for a quick trip to America, apparently a prelude to the next recorded adventure in the series.<br />If you can't get enough of Holmes and Watson, and don't mind some &quot;bending the willow&quot; (as Jeremy Brett liked to call it), you'll probably enjoy this wildly implausible adventure of the two old friends.	2001-10-08

I have avoided reviewing this massive failure for quite a while, since Sir Arthur was one of my childhood heroes. I still recall the thrill when I found some paperback collections of his short stories at a local drug store in the early 1950s... here was a science fiction writer who knew science and also knew the future of mankind lay in space exploration!<br />Well, my idol soon developed feet of clay, so to speak. Becoming a physics major, I soon discovered Clarke's actual knowledge of physics was nothing to write home about. And as the 1960s wore on, into the 1970s, and then the 1980s, I found him more and more frequently lending his name to unworthy but presumably profitable undertakings in which he himself all-too-obviously had no involvement whatsoever, including an increasingly unreadable and apparently interminable series of &quot;novels.&quot;<br />The present anthology is almost all clay, and endlessly padded and repetitive clay at that. There is no visible editing, and misprints are everywhere (my favorite is &quot;brass bar&quot; where Clarke wrote &quot;brass bra&quot;! You can bet that he never read, or reread, a word of the text printed here.) Most vexing is that the entire tome is a shameless and absolutely relentless display of egotism and name-dropping that makes Forrest J. Ackerman look humble! Many of the contributions are brief notes or tributes dashed off hastily on various occasions and quite unworthy of being preserved in this way. Inspirational evocations of the wonders of the space frontier are cheek-by-jowl with unreadably dull travelogues and tediously written, utterly trivial underwater &quot;adventures&quot;.<br />Worst of all, while a young Clarke fought against pseudoscience, an elderly, ailing Clarke has shamelessly and incomprehensibly embraced it and there are some really, really embarrassing testimonials to the wonders of the long-forgotten &quot;cold fusion&quot; and to the &quot;zero-point&quot; variant of perpetual motion.<br />Finally, I'd like to note that the early Clarke has a lot to say about what it means if world society turns its face from the endless promises of infinity and instead gazes at its navel Eastern style--- it means, he says bluntly, cultural death. The elder Clarke, living in just such a culture, and receiving rich (but token) rewards from it, has fallen strangely silent. Some of Clarke's fellow science fiction writers (virtually none of whom he mentions at all in the course of the book) knew what this meant as early as the 1970s--- see for example fellow British author John Brunner's STAND ON ZANZIBAR, in which the crazed inhabitants of an overpopulated earth tear at one another senselessly in mass-murders of ever-increasing scale, like a hundred rats in a laboratory cage built for three --- and precisely what you read about with ever-increasing frequency and severity in your daily newspapers! Coincidence? This is one science-fictional scenario I desperately wish had remained fictional!<br />Anyway, save your money, folks. This volume is unworthy of your attention, and quite unworthly of the Arthur C. Clarke we used to know and admire.Finally, I'd like to note that the early Clarke has a lot to say about what it means if world society turns its face from the endless promises of infinity and instead gazes at its navel Eastern style--- it means, he says bluntly, cultural death.

There is surprisingly little overlap between this book's contents<br />and the contents of the previous (and sold out) SERIAL MOVIE<br />POSTERS. One reason is that this new book is based on an<br />incredible collection assembled by Frank Gutierrez.<br />What we have are posters from sound serials dating from about 1931 to about 1954, the end of the serial era.<br />The best of the serial posters are reminiscent of the best pulp magazine covers from the 1920s to the 1950s, and often<br />are rendered in somewhat the same style. My favorites in the<br />present volume tend to use a subdued palette, such as<br />5, for THE GALLOPING GHOST, which is a striking study in<br />grey, orange and red, or 28, for the orginal FLASH GORDON,<br />chapter 4, which uses shades of grey, orange, and a few touches<br />of red. Also lovely is the poster for TIM TYLER'S LUCK, which<br />uses reds, flesh tones, olive grey and cream shades.<br />As the 30s wear into the 40s the painted artwork becomes increasingly crude<br /> and amateurish. An exception is 107,<br />for BRENDA STARR, REPORTER. Artwork tends to become a frame<br />for a tinted still from the film, and the frames get thinner<br />and thinner. Still, there are points of interest. The poster<br />for BRICK BRADFORD (112) is almost as wild as this wildest of<br />all movie serials.<br />Serial posters are far rarer than movie posters in general, and<br />this is a very worthy compilation of images most of us have<br />never seen, and will never see any other way!	2001-09-03

Well, the problem is that most of the<br />science fiction films from this period were ultra-low budget,<br />which translates as to &quot;no money for art for posters,&quot; and<br />&quot;no colorizing of stills used as lobby cards.&quot;  And that<br />translates further to, &quot;of very little visual interest.&quot;<br />Not that there are not some good posters, but the good ones<br />are all familiar.  THE THING (7) features giant letters carved<br />apparently out of gobbets of raw flesh!  INVASION OF THE BODY<br />SNATCHERS (38) features tiny images of running pairs of<br />people on a half-red, half-yellow background with a<br />superimposed hand print.  The beautifully painted poster for<br />ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN is not only a fine portrait of the<br />sultry Allison Hayes, but depicts the largest &quot;squirrel shot&quot;<br />in the history of urban civilization!  But you've seen 'em.<br />There is so little of real interest here that you'll find<br />yourself killing time by counting the number of posters that<br />feature monsters or robots carrying girls in a scandalous state<br />of undress.  Having done that you may find yourself reduced<br />to looking for posters in which the monsters or robots carry<br />(or sort of brandish!) boys and adult males (all fully clothed,<br />I am happy to say).<br />If none of this sounds appealing, I suggest you save your money,<br />and I wish that I had.	2001-09-03

Some autobiographical information must preface this review.<br />In 1948, when I was 8, my family moved a few blocks East, which<br />put me half a block from a corner drugstore which had two fat<br />racks of comics, and one fat rack of paperbacks. I already loved<br />the Donald Duck &quot;illustrated novels&quot; by a genius I later discovered to be Carl Barks.<br />Now I found two other wonderful<br />universes, that of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family, and of<br />Jack Cole's Plastic Man. (Four years later I discovered EC<br />comics, but that's a story in itself!) I mention this only<br />to stress that kids recognize quality when they see it, and<br />boy, oh, boy, was there quality in the titles I mentioned!<br />Well, Carl Barks lived to see all his comic work put into print<br />both in trade paperbacks and hardbacks. The Marvels, acquired<br />in a hostile takeover by a rival publisher, were buried, and<br />except for a single large, expensive hardback published 15 years<br />ago, have not received the preservation they merited.<br />Now it seems to be Jack Cole's turn. There are two expensive<br />hardback compilations of Plastic Man stories from DC comics,<br />still available here at Amazon.com... but this current volume<br />aims to present ole Plas to a larger audience.<br />Art Spiegelman used his two &quot;Maus&quot; graphic novels to gain the<br />attention of the New York literary establishment, and since<br />then has valiantly tried to interest that same establishment<br />in some of the classics of comic art. Here he gives us a<br />brief biography of Jack Cole, and some samples of his Plastic<br />Man, crime, PLAYBOY and syndicated newspaper comic strip work.<br />Unfortunately, the book's design, attributed to one &quot;Chip Kidd&quot;,<br />is eye-blastingly hideous and chaotic. What's more the text<br />is made nearly illegible (and sometimes unfindable) by<br />being printed in various official Plastic Man colors<br />(white on black, ok, yellow on black, ok, black on yellow,<br />acceptable, yellow on dark red risky, black on dark red<br />nearly unreadable!). Even the reproduction of the Plastic Man strips<br />is poor; the faded, yellowed comics pages have been photographed<br />directly, and although digital restoration is credited, no detectable effort<br />has been made to bring out the text and art.<br />Although Jack Cole was justifiably famous for the organic unity<br />of his mind-bending layouts, the present book usually looks like a<br />random collage made by an untalented 6-year-old child. In<br />fact, the last eleven pages of the book are quite literally<br />collages, and woefully inept collages at that.<br /><br />Why should we care about Jack Cole? He succeeded in three<br />usually unrelated art venues, the comic book, the slick magazine<br />cartoon, and the syndicated newspaper strip. His comic<br />book work showed what can only be described as genius, both<br />in visual and scripting arenas. And he committed suicide at<br />the peak of his career, under mysterious circumstances.<br />What more do you want?<br />What Cole will be remembered for is Plastic Man, a character<br />who was literally polymorphous, who could appear in directly<br />adjacent panels as a sports car, a piece of furniture, wet wash<br />on a clothes line, part of a building, a mailbox, a lovely woman,<br />a billboard, or the curbstone of an entire block! Cole<br />worked with Will Eisner (ghosting THE SPIRIT<br />at one time) and Eisner's influence shows clearly<br />in covers like the one used as this book's title page, in which<br />six crooks simultaneously shoot one another to death while<br />the lines of their shots circumscribe a book store from which<br />Plastic Man looks out in amazement, while the store rests on<br />a huge book which is crushing Plas's comical sidekick Woozie!<br />But Cole quickly became indebted to nobody. His famous<br />crime comics (the legendary &quot;Murder, Morphine and Me&quot; is reprinted in its entirety)<br />were distinguished by gritty, violent, realistic<br />scripts and wildly distorted, surrealistic art as disturbing<br />as any nightmare.<br />Yet his syndicated strip &quot;Betsy and Me&quot; couldn't be more different. Drawn in a sophisticated-primitive style like the<br />UPA cartoons popular in the early '50s, it represents and presents the dull, day-to-day life of an<br />idyllic 1950s nuclear family. And Cole's art for PLAYBOY is more<br />different still... lavish watercolors of impossibly desirable<br />women, no two of which look even vaguely alike, a detail that is the mark of<br />a consummate illustrator... Virgil Finlay comes to mind.<br /><br />The text, originally published in different and far more legible<br />form in the NEW YORKER, is interesting, but the real Jack<br />Cole never emerges. Perhaps, like Shakespeare's Buckingham, he<br />was too &quot;deep revolving&quot; to let anyone, even his beloved wife<br />Dorothy, see beneath the nondescript surface.<br />In any event, this is the best introduction to Jack Cole<br />we're likely to get any time soon. Too bad the design of<br />this plastic-bound volume (li'l joke there, har, har?) is so hideous<br />that you may need to keep an airline air-sickness bag close at<br />hand each time you turn a page!ly distorted, surrealistic art as disturbing<BR>as any nightmare.<BR>Yet his syndicated strip &quot;Betsy and Me&quot; couldn't be more different.

When I first obtained the two thick yellow hardbound volumes of this book more than a decade ago, I could hardly express my delight at the serious and detailed attention given to those films I loved so much as a child and teenager in the golden 1950s. I still enjoy dipping into it. A relevant story... About a decade ago, my brother was visiting me for a week. My movie- and TV-related books were in what was then the guest bedroom. After his first night with me, I asked if he had had any trouble sleeping, since my neighborhood is sometimes noisy and he was in those days troubled with insomnia. He replied, &quot;I never got to sleep.&quot; When I asked what the trouble was, he said, &quot;No trouble, I just saw KEEP WATCHING THE SKIES on the shelf, got it down, and couldn't stop reading!&quot; There is one problem with the first volume of the book, a problem the author himself points out--- it was written before the age of videotape, so that the author was unable to watch any of the films he discussed while writing the discussions, and was unable to see some of the films, such as DEVIL GIRL FROM MARS, at all. This is one reason the second volume is so much fatter than the first, because when it was written video tapes were becoming available for all the films being analyzed. One can only dream of what the first volume would have been like, had it been written in 1990, say. But we should be thankful for what we have. A detailed treatment of some of the best-loved films ever made, and a literate, thoughtful, informed and accurate treatment too. Highly recommended.	2001-08-25

J. M. Gregson is a professional writer of mystery novels, at least one of which has also involved golf. He gets Holmes and Watson, and the 1896 milieu pretty much bang-on.<br />Alas, he uses Standard Pastiche Plot B (more recently seen in Val Andrews' HOLBOURNE EMPORIUM), but in this case it gives a plausible reason for Holmes' inaction, which serves to stretch the material to novel length (174 pages) without insulting the IQ of the reader or Holmes.  Like Andrews' novel, the plot is a fairly thin excuse to give a detailed, nostalgic  look at  a vanished world--- in this case, the world of golfing clubs, golf tournaments and golf championships in 1896.  I am no golfer, not knowing one end of a &quot;stick&quot; from another, but I wasn't bored.<br />Clues are fairly given, and the astute reader will be way ahead of Watson in identifying the villain, even if he doesn't recognize Standard Plot B early on.  Recommended.	2001-08-23

Most historians would be happy, nay overjoyed, if they located a diary, a journal or a set of letters by a participant in some historical event.  In tracing some relatively unimportant activities, Gray is not satisfied unless he can find three or four itineraries, four or five journals and diaries, and two or three sets of letters!  Another reviewer commented that the writing of this book took 25 years!  I can well believe it. With the well-known fallibility of eyewitnesses, this overwhelming mass of documentation is barely enough to allow Gray to sift event from confabulation.<br />What we have here are two books in one. The first book, in  180 pages, traces the life and career of guide and translator Mitch Boyer.  At first  one might dismiss such a goal as impossible, but Gray is equal to the task, and Boyer emerges as a convincing, consistent and competent historical personage.<br />The second book, in about 200 pages, uses what Gray calls &quot;time-motion studies&quot; to trace the troop movements from June 9, 1876 to and through the culminating  Battle of the Little Bighorn.  His &quot;time-motion patterns&quot; are what physicists call &quot;world lines,&quot; with one space dimension as the vertical axis, and time as the horizontal axis.  Where these diagrams indicate the interactions between a dozen separated groups they virtually amount to the classical equivalent of Feynman diagrams--- tools used by theoretical physicists to disentangle the various processes occurring in the realm  where relativistic quantum physics hold sway.<br />The Mitch Boyer connection between the first and second parts of the book occurs because Boyer was the only scout who chose to stay with and die with Custer's columns.  Much of Gray's reconstruction of Custer's movements and strategy depends upon  Gray's extraction, from the mass of confused interviews with Curley, the 17-year-old Indian scout who was the last to get away alive from Custer's troops, of a fairly consistent and highly plausible set of events.<br />There is one place, at the book's end, where Gray's thought patterns betray him.  With no documents to guide him, he chooses a completely absurd counterclockwise movement of Army forces, from Calhoun Ridge, to Custer Ridge, to Custer Hill (where Custer was found), on to the &quot;South Skirmish Line&quot; (where Mitch Boyer's body was found) and thence to the &quot;West Perimeter,&quot; where the last survivors (Gray assumes) died.  But this movement actually takes the troops TOWARD the river and the Indian camp, from which braves and even squaws were literally boiling, like thick clouds of hornets from a disturbed nest, in the last half of the battle!<br />In this case, I think the reconstruction by Gregory F. Michno, based on a collation of a vast number of Indian accounts, is infinitely more plausible.  It shows Custer's surviving companies driven roughly northwest, parallel to the river, along Battle Ridge to Custer Hill, with companies on Finley Ridge and Calhoun Hill being cut off and quickly destroyed,  leading to a traditional &quot;Last Stand&quot; indeed  being made on Custer Hill. See Michno's LAKOTA NOON for details. I might mention that comparison of all accounts of troop movements in the six or so &quot;Little Bighorn&quot; books I have read is made incredibly difficult by a complete lack of consistent nomenclature for the topographic features of the battleground!<br />Grey is remarkably even-tempered in his discussion of the many command problems and highly questionable command decisions that arose in this campaign, including the inexplicable behavior of Gibbon and Benteen.  Somewhat  ironically, it is Custer who comes off best from this all-around debacle.  He was about the only commander who made any effort to follow orders, and about the only commander who tried to strike a balance between total inaction and suicidal total commitment of his forces.<br />I can't praise this book highly enough.ighly plausible set of events.  <br />There is one place, at the book's end, where Gray's thought patterns betray him.

Here's another candidate for what I hope will remain a fairly short shelf, the Holmes pastiche whose author thought enough of it to pay to have it published, but not enough of it to revise and rewrite it up to any acceptable literary standards. The other volumes on this shelf at my abode are Fullenkamp's SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE DRAGONS, and Stefanie's THE CHARTERS AFFAIR.<br />What we get here are three short novels, averaging about 90 pages apiece.  Both dialogue and narration are best described as &quot;rough,&quot; and the book has many misprints on top of the author's own continual gaffes.  [See if you can guess what punctuation has been inexplicably replaced by a capital C, on p. 57 and many other places in the first adventure!  See if you can spot the reference to the &quot;annuls of crime.&quot;  See Mycroft say, &quot;You must drop it,&quot; when he really means (to judge from remarks immediately following) that Sherlock needs to solve the crime as soon as humanly possible.]<br />What is one to make of a spying adventure during WW I in which the female villainess (who, alas, remains mostly offstage) is named Frederica Von StRada? [I guess it is a mercy she wasn't named Emmie Amelingling, if we have to keep the  operatic reference!]  What is one to make of Holmes depending upon  pendulum dowsing to locate a German submarine base, in the same adventure?  Not even Conan Doyle, despite his gullibility and fanatic devotion to what we now call the New Age, would have let Holmes mingle with the supernatural... a realm where Holmes, functioning as Holmes, could only act as a debunker to the foolish beliefs Conan Doyle would have been terrified to have debunked.  [See the recent, fine biography of Conan Doyle by Daniel Stashower for more on this point.]<br />The three cases, apart from the spy adventure, which is all frantic action, involve a not very mysterious murder near Stonehenge, leading to an incomprehensible climax involving buried treasure, and a complex case of art forgery.  The art forgery adventure suffers from lack of a Holmesian summing up, so that the reader is left even more mystified than Watson by some of the events.  The Stonehenge adventure suffers from total and complete predictablity from the earliest pages onward.<br />If, like me, you think there was something to be said for Edward D. Wood Jr. as a writer of prose fiction, you may  also find a place in your heart for works like this one.  Otherwise, I think you really must drop it, Mister or Ms. Gentle Reader!sure, and a complex case of art forgery.

If you're looking for a baffling mystery within the literary form of the Holmes pastiche, this won't be your oyster.  The main aim of author Andrews here is an evocation of the legendary department store Gammages, at the turn of the last century. Here it is in thin disguise as A. W. Forrage, Ltd., e.g. &quot;Forrages.&quot;  As in a number of Andrews' recent Holmes novels, a number of real, historical characters appear, including magicians Stanley Collins and Wil Goldston... can you spot the others?<br />The plot, to the extent that there is one, is a thinly veiled excuse to have Holmes and Watson wander around Gammages and marvel at the diversity of offerings of this wonderous store. You'll probably (correctly) identify not only the villain, but also his motives, after a few dozen pages.  Andrews adds a couple of mild snappers at the end, but at 126 pages it's not just the plot that's thin.<br />Gammages is the focus, not Holmes and Watson.  Keep this in mind as you read and you won't be too disappointed.	2001-08-17

Here the situation faced by Holmes, Watson and Lestrade has a distinctly modern touch, but without jarring anachronism.<br />A psycho serial child killer named Algernon Clayton, convicted 20 years before, has been released from prison on a technicality and has become the leading exhibit in a questionable but popular social reform movement.  It's almost routine today for brutal killers to be sanitized by the forces of Political Correctness and converted into saintly, put-upon targets of police brutality and social repression, suitable to be the figurehead of some large organization self-proclaimed to be Fighters for Truth and Justice, and--- it could have happened in 1895 as easily as 1995.<br />Naturally, the luckless Lestrade, who was only indirectly involved in the original case, has become the  prime scapegoat of the reformers.  Holmes is thus presented with a complex set of problems: if Clayton was indeed guilty, how can he be  neutralized by evidence that will stand in court, before he begins another killing spree?  How can Lestrade be protected from the press and the reformers?  And what hope is there of finding new evidence in a case cold for two decades?<br />To say more would spoil the grim fun. At 140 pages this is just about right in length for a case in which Holmes finds himself doing fairly routine police work in hopes of turning up some lead by sheer chance and persistence.  As you can see, this isn't your mother's Holmes pastiche, unless your mother's pastiche was written by Andrew Vachss.<br />You'll enjoy it, I think.	2001-08-17

Here we backslide a bit, firmly into the middle rank.<br />The eccentric Lord Hammerford has left a strange will which basically requires his two prospective heirs to engage in a kind of scavenger hunt, the end goal being a hidden box containing Lord Hammerford's wealth, converted into gems. But Hammerford dies about 15 years prematurely for the  actions required by the will to favor both heirs equally, and Holmes is called in on behalf of  the one of the heirs Hammerford's early death severely handicaps. Meanwhile at least two(?) gangs of criminals are after the  hidden gems as well.<br />Various pastiche authors handle stretching Holmes out to novel length by having the criminals act in incredibly stupid fashion, and others handle the stretch by having Holmes himself behave in incredibly stupid fashion. The present work tends to the latter, rather than the former, solution.  Even Watson out-thinks Holmes here, more than a couple of times.<br />In any case, the plot calls for action more than ratiocination, with several wild carriage chases through crowded London byways, and a royal battle with a gang of kidnappers, in which even Billy the pageboy gets to take a hand. You may or may not enjoy it all.  I have mixed feelings about it myself.  But at 137 pages, you are not going to waste a lot of your time, whatever your final judgement.	2001-08-09

In fact, I read it in one sitting, not too difficult since it weighs in at only 123 pages.<br />Perhaps I like it because it is a bit more traditional in structure than the usual Andrews Holmes novel.  The leader and founder of a non-religious monastic order inhabiting the old Grimstone Priory comes to Baker Street with a strange problem for Holmes.  Two of the order's seven members have died shortly after receiving letters, and a third member has just received a similar letter.  Holmes and Watson join the order as two replacements for the dead monks (the number of monks is  maintained at precisely seven), and Holmes proceeds to  investigate, soon deciding that the key to the murders lies in an unsolved jewel robbery which occurred at Grimstone years before, when it was the family home of the Grimstones.<br />There are a number of echoes of HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, which is explicitly referred to, and (as all too often in Holmes pastiches) the approach adopted by the villain is preposterously roundabout and indirect, considering his goal as ultimately revealed.  [He could have &quot;harvested&quot; the large perch and vanished at any time, without subjecting the monks, Holmes and Watson to 95 pages of ultimately irrelevant antics, but then, I guess, we should have had no novel!]<br />There are some nice characterizations, some good surprises, and a pleasant read in store for anyone who tries this particular Andrews novel.	2001-08-05

This paperback from 2000 is a reprint, with a few minor corrections of misprints, of the 1993 hardback edition. The only actual new text is the &quot;preface to the revised edition,&quot; dated May 1999.<br />Sarf's approach is even-handed, and he has a real eye for telling details and for vivid quotes from participants and eyewitnesses.  Boxes set apart from the main text give needed detail and background, particularly on individuals participating. A great deal of exotic color is provided by the various indians who rode with both sides in the conflict.  For example, riding with General Crooke were The Other Magpie, a beautiful female warrior, and Finds Them And Kills Them, a transvestite who dressed and lived as a woman except  during battles!  You don't encounter  soldiers of that calibre in most military histories!<br />The Summer Campaign of 1876 is distinguished by the almost staggering military incompetence displayed by the U.S. Army leaders.  Apart from Custer, who generally seemed to know  what he was up to, and the canny Nelson Miles, virtually every commander in the field seemed to be clueless, cowardly, vacillating, and in a couple of cases (Gibbon comes to mind at once) apparently paralyzed by mental illness.<br />Well-written and extremely readable.  If you have ever wondered how Custer really got into that very bad fix, this is the best place to start your quest for understanding, and Sarf also offers a good annotated list for further reading.	2001-08-05

After sending his famous message to Benteen, &quot;Big Village, Come Quick, Bring Packs,&quot; Custer and his men vanish from  U. S. Army history.  What happened thereafter was witnessed mainly by Custer's foes in the battle.  Although huge numbers of Indian accounts have been collected in the roughly 125 years since Little Bighorn, historians have generally thrown up  their hands at the gross contradictions, inconsistencies, confabulations and impossibilities found in the Indian accounts.<br />What Michno has done is to go through the published and unpublished accounts available, and fit them into a framework of time and space that actually turns out to make a fairly consistent picture of Custer's last battle.  As several other reviewers have noted, there is a large piece missing from Michno's material, namely the accounts of the Indian scouts riding with the 7th Cavalry.  It is very puzzling that this resource was ignored.  However, that is the only real problem I found with the book.  Michno uses the Indian accounts to explode a fairly large number of myths about the battle and its participants, particuarly Gall, Crazy Horse and Sitting  Bull.  He also winds up with the only really convincing version I have read of the disposition and movements of Custer's men during the various stages leading up to the classic hilltop &quot;Last Stand.&quot;<br />In the past 50 years academic historians have largely retreated completely from any desire to find out or recount what &quot;actually&quot; happened in any historical event.  Instead, the event is used only as the thinnest of pretexts to grind various ideological axes.  Custer's defeat was being used in this way almost the second Libby Custer died, more than 70 years ago.  So it's doubly refreshing to find a history book where the facts are still the focus of concern.<br />This book is not, and is not intended to be, a complete account of the Battle of the Little Big Horn.  It is best read  as a companion to other standard works on the battle,  such as Gray's.ard works on the battle,  such as Gray's.	2001-08-04

It is the only book in the series I have read and will certainly forevermore  remain the  one and only.  Had I the inductive skills of Conan Doyle's Sherlock and Mycroft, I would have put the book back on the bookstore shelves as soon as I noticed that all the reviewers' blurbs on the flyleaf and back cover are from publications of the Western East Podunk Grain and Corn Bulletin sort.<br />Well, what we have is an almost completely plotless 320 pages, in which the author carefully describes every scrap of food and sip of liquid that goes into Mycoft's mouth, but never finds time to create characters, situations or developments that would be of any interest to the long-suffering reader.  The books most similar to this one that I have seen are the Irene Adler novels of Carol Nelson Douglas, in which there are 50 pages of descriptions of Irene's outfits for every paragraph in which Irene wonders idly who killed the little Paris seamstress about 200 pages back, and why.<br />Mycroft himself seems to have no real job, and spends his time eating, fretting in a distant, avuncular way, and sending and receiving telegrams which never amount to anything.  In this particular novel, someone of questionable judgement has chosen Mycroft to organize getting the friendly Scandinavian Prince Oscar safely out of England, before an international incident is created by having him assassinated on English soil. The novel takes place in a completely imaginary  and relentlessly superficial world, connected in no way to the sociopolitical realities of 1890.  Instead, we have two gigantic, global and preposterously efficient forces for evil, the Brotherhood and the Golden Lodge.  Unlike vaguely similar organizations in our real world, whose members have trouble finding their shoes, pistols and computers in the morning, the organizations Mycroft faces here are always 30 steps ahead of him, even when he has only just decided what to do.  Thus he and his two aides, Guthrie and Tyers, are always reacting, never acting.  Not that much happens that they need to react to, as there is virtually no action.<br />I got the feeling that the book is a first draft, and that the author never had time to go back and decide what to do with certain sequences.  For example, there is an interminable early  chapter in which Mycroft gets Chief Inspector Somerford drunk over dinner, and questions him apparently to some point, but no point ever develops and the Inspector in fact never appears in the novel again!  On the Flying Scotsman,  Mycroft identifies a passenger as being crudely disguised  to appear to be a printer, though there would be absolutely no point to such an impersonation, but later the passenger is (correctly) found to be a bookie, and the ink and chalk stains Mycroft referred to earlier are not part of a disguise, but rather the normal appearance of a bookie who has boarded the train in haste without time to clean up.  Or, again, the  assassin aboard the train is the one person who could not  possibly be the assassin, and the only murder he does commit has no point and is never explained.  In fact, the novel ends as if the author had simply reached the proper page count. It is fair to say that 80% of the questions raised during the novel's course, uninteresting as they may be, are not answered, or even brought up again.  They are just there to expend ink and pages.<br />So I wouldn't advise expending your hard-earned funds in this particular case.rouble finding their shoes, pistols and computers in the morning, the organizations Mycroft faces here are always 30 steps ahead of him, even when he has only just decided what to do.

June Thomson is a British mystery writer who has published about 18 novels concerning her own characters, and three pastiche collections of Sherlock Holmes short stories. What she seems to be doing here is getting another book out of her research and thoughts about the Holmes and Watson characters, as accumulated during the writing of the three short-story collections.<br />There is not much that is original here, and Thomson leans particularly heavily on D. Martin Dakin's SHERLOCK HOLMES COMMENTARY.  What is good is Thomson's refusal to speculate wildly.  She hews in a Fundamentalist way to the letter of the Canon; and, her main interest is the changing relations between Holmes and Watson, particularly as affected by Holmes' increasing deteriorating mental stability, and Watson's two marriages.<br />Thomson's two claims of originality lie in her identification of the person Watson disguised as the \\"King of Bohemia\\"--- an identification I don't buy at all; and, her identification of Watson's mysterious second wife, an identification I find brilliant and completely convincing.<br />This 2001 ... edition seems to be printed directly from the plates of the 1995 British edition, and the type shows quite a bit of damage, with a number of missing letters.<br />If you are a lover of the Canon, and of Holmes and Watson, you'll find much to ponder in this organized review of what few hints the Canon gives us on matters of the actual dates of various cases, and on the day-to-day life and relationship of  the Great Detective and his faithful Boswell.	2001-07-15

Lately they have been revived by George Lucas and some of the large comic book publishers. This is something different, much slimmer, printed in full color on glossy paper... and in many ways, a work of art.<br />The art is done apparently freehand in ink (w/o pencilling as a guide) and then colored in with colored pencils and pastel chalks. The story?  There's no story, you just meet the main characters of the Mutts strip, Earl, Mooch, Sid, Crabby,  Woofy, Guard Dog, etc.  They give you some advice--- verbally or by example!--- and then we move on to the next.

Here we have 5 Holmes pastiches, clocking in at a total of 174 pages, a bit more substantial than the usual Breese Holmes volumes. First, the good features: the stories are fairly well told, and there is a lot of authentic-seeming local color--- cricket in 1896, Aussies vs. medical students; Sligo in Ireland, with a walkon by W. B. Yeats; the tourist charms of Glastonbury; Osea near Maldon, in Essex.<br />Holmes and Watson are... well... ok, but a lot of the dialogue lacks a period sound. The plots are not always up to snuff, either. For example &quot;The Strange Affair at Glastonbury&quot; is quite literally a pastiche, awkwardly combining elements of &quot;The Redheaded League&quot; and &quot;The Musgrave Ritual.&quot; The author also has an annoying stylistic defect, which appears in Watson's narrative and in all the dialogue, no matter who is speaking: broken sentences.<br />Did the timid Harold Norman really witness a murder at Tandridge Hall, even though Sir George Simon and his staff stoutly deny it? Did Stamford die in the attempt to steal a priceless painting of Lord Sheffield's--- or did he die while attempting to stop the the thief? Why is an Irish doctor continually waylaid and assaulted, when he carries nothing of value and has no enemies? Why is Glastonbury beset by strange pranks each of which must have taken all night to perpetrate? Can Holmes solve a possible murder with the only clue being the voice of the victim as recorded on an early Edison phonograph? In the majority of these cases, I think you'll enjoy finding out.	2001-07-11

As a physics professor in the 1970s, I tried introducing my &quot;liberal arts physics&quot; students to Richard Feynman, via xerox copies of some of his writings, and via the filmed Messenger Lectures of a decade before, &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;--- by the way, why aren't these available today on video tape?<br />Now, 25 years later, there's a modest &quot;boom&quot; of Feynman material in print, by no means all worthy of being in that state (which is why Feynman kept a number of lecture transcripts tucked away forgotten in file folders) and one fears, after seeing &quot;The Meaning of it All,&quot; that even Feynman's used kleenex and desk blotters are not safe from publication!<br />But this collection is welcome for gathering together many  transcriptions of his famous talks from this era,  the 1960s and 1970s, the best of which are &quot;Los Alamos from Below,&quot; the deservedly legendary  &quot;There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,&quot; &quot;What is Science?&quot; and &quot;Cargo Cult Science.&quot;<br />As a physicist and as one who had the pleasure of hearing  Feynman lecture in person on a number of occasions, I had some reservations about the editing of this book, however.  The book unwisely starts out with an interview from late in Feynman's life, in which he tells some of his favorite stories in a quite inarticulate way, and then edits out the same stories as they appear in far more comprehensible fashion in the later material (related two decades before).  The editor himself seems singularly innocent of  science in all its aspects, which results in some major howlers. For example, the speed of light in glass is about 75% of its speed in vacuum, far from  &quot;a fraction of a percent&quot; slower than its vacuum speed (p.xii) and CP Invariance (p. 101) has no connection whatsoever to conservation of charge.  The operator C, &quot;charge conjugation,&quot; changes particles to antiparticles.  And so on!<br />Some of the material presents Feynman strugging publicly with ideas, presentations and even grammar.  By comparing the actual Messenger Lectures of 1965 with their published versions, you can see how carefully Feynman himself would edit such transcripts before publication.  Without the touch of the master, &quot;The Pleaure of Finding Things Out,&quot; an interview which opens the book and &quot;The Relation of Science and Religion,&quot; which closes it, don't make a whole lot of sense!  Feynman in person, no matter how much he might struggle to get a thought or concept stated to his satisfaction, would convey the  successful outcome by body language and a triumphant tone of voice--- to see a transcript in cold print is to see a lot of rambling words with no clear focus, which is no service at all to Feynman, one of the princes of clear thinking!<br />Recommended with some serious reservations.ents Feynman strugging publicly with ideas, presentations and even grammar.

Kill 'Em!: The Life and TImes of Sam Peckinpah	Books	4	7	8	N	N	&quot;Let's Go!&quot;	If there has ever been a man for whom the phrase &quot;consumed by his inner demons&quot; was apt, that man was director Sam Peckinpah. And as David Weddle makes clear in this massive and massively detailed biography, Peckinpah's films bring many of these demons out to strut or cower on the silver screen.  As Weddle remarks, almost everyone who loves film can remember the first time he saw THE WILD BUNCH, and yet, like almost all of Peckinpah's &quot;serious&quot; films other than RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, it was severely mutilated by studio meddling.<br />Not since Orson Welles has there been a famous director who had so much trouble with studio interference.  And yet there were clearly times when some intelligent interference was more than justified... MAJOR DUNDEE falls completely to pieces in its &quot;third half,&quot; to echo Tom and Ray of CAR TALK. THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE is a giant void at its center... where there should be a love story, there's absolute vacuum, despite the talents of the performers.  STRAW DOGS is repellant and unmemoriable despite the efforts of Dustin Hoffman.  Sam turned every film in which he had much control into a psychodrama in which his characters wrestled with Sam's own problems. In this, he was a true auteur.<br />Weddle's research is overwhelming and his information about Peckinpah's childhood, college days and TV career is very enlightening... but he makes a major mistake in trying to relate these early experiences of Peckinpah in the most mechanical and naive way to Peckinpah's massive later psychological problems. We even listen in to some of Peckinpah's innermost thoughts, which is pretty preposterous in a supposed work of nonfiction.<br />And as another reviewer has noted, the list of influences on Peckinpah has a gigantic lapse--- other directors!  Apart from a few random mentions of John Ford, there's hardly a hint that Peckinpah ever went to movies, or ever studied the works of other directors.  Yet his early films burst onto the scene precisely when there was a directorial ferment almost without precedent in US and international film-making.<br />Peckinpah's film career is a sad and disturbing litany of maniacal career- and self-destruction.  After alcohol withered his talents to a minimum, he discovered cocaine, and spent the rest of his short life in a moronic haze penetrated randomly by spurts of insane violence and agression... until his heart stopped abruptly.  Ironically, in his decline he did a couple of by-the-numbers potboiler action films, and these were the only ones of his films that made real money for the studios. His best known, and best, films, like the WILD BUNCH, were  box-office failures and not available for viewing even today in their uncut, unmutilated forms.<br />It's almost all here, a repellent and tragic story that only a Shakespeare could really do much justice to.  Recommended, if you've ever wondered what kind of man could have had the vision embodied in the first 15 minutes or the final 15 minutes of THE WILD BUNCH.st onto the scene precisely when there was a directorial ferment almost without precedent in US and international film-making.<br />Peckinpah's film career is a sad and disturbing litany of maniacal career- and self-destruction.

Beginning sometime before WWI, British schoolboys waited for the next weekly issue of various &quot;Boys' periodicals&quot; such as THE MAGNET and THE GEM, in hopes it would contain the latest adventures of Billy Bunter and the Famous Five at Greyfriars School.  New Bunter books were being issued 50 years later, as copies in my collection indicate, and as far as I know they are still coming out nearly a century later.  As Val Andrews says in his dedication of the present volume, Frank Richards' &quot;incredible output of brilliant School stories gave many a working-class boy a public-school education.&quot;  Indeed!<br />In the present volume, set circa 1912, Watson gets his retired friend Holmes to tackle a seemingly minor mystery.  The manuscript of a history of Greyfriars School has vanished.  Is it genuine theft, a prank, or the work of a malicious student... or the tip of something far more serious?  We learn that Watson himself was educated at Greyfriars (!), and all the beloved Richards characters, Bunter, the Famous Five, the evil-tempered Mr Quelch, and the vile bully Horace Coker [no relation, I hope, to your own humble scribe, whose meek  and saintly aspect  is justly famed!], make brief walk-on appearances.<br />The mystery is soon solved (the book barely runs 100 pages), and the main attraction here is nostalgic.  If you're a Bunter fan, or have always wondered who the heck he is, you might give this one a try.	2001-06-18

This is one of those ideas that sounds great when first proposed. Most large comic publishers between the 1940s and the 1970s offered a genre of comics aimed at young female readers, the &quot;romance&quot; titles, which featured absurd tales in which the course of true love never does run smooth.  Artwork was generally minimally competent, with all females looking alike and all males looking alike.  (In the case of the most incompetent artists, all HUMANS looked alike.)  Why not take a set of stories (in this case from DC titles ranging from late 1950s to late 1970s) and write new dialogue and captions, but leave the art (except for a few small signs) unchanged?  Sounds promising!<br />But, here, it usually doesn't work.  The  very mild and narrow &quot;chick wit&quot; left this old codger with only a single laugh in the whole book, and not that many smiles.  In the most successful, and funniest, stories: (1) A blonde bimbo who never makes a move without consulting her psychic finds, at story's end, that the (sultry brunette) psychic can put on some moves herself!  (2) A girl in a seaside community whose entire population has been rendered completely mindless by  toxic pollution falls in love with the EPA man sent to investigate.  But the need to use existing art sometimes completely defeats the writer.  For example, a story about a girl who refuses to check her bags at the airport goes nowhere, because the very odd art (in which the girl often poses standing inclined at 45 degrees to the vertical, for no conceivable reason!) is basically unadaptable. In yet another story so poorly drawn that all characters, male and female, look alike, the comic possibilities of their resemblance are very poorly realized.  Very little, also, is  made of the wild changes in fashion seen between the late 1950s and the late 1970s.<br />Not recommended with any marked enthusiasm!	2001-06-16

If you were about 10 years old in 1950, there was very likely a moment of absolute epiphany in your young life.  In my case it occurred in the Junior High library in about 1950.  From the shelf I pulled a large dark blue book about 8 by 11 inches in size. Even the end-papers were stunning, color plates of the surfaces of Mercury and Jupiter.  But, thumbing through, I actually began to tremble when I got to facing pages 132 and 133!  It is safe to say I have never recovered from  the sight.  I now have two copies of this book, one at home which I purchased in about 1951 and one in my office, which I purchased a few years ago.  It was THE CONQUEST OF SPACE, by Chelsey Bonestell and Willy Ley.<br />Who was this incredible artist, Chelsey Bonestell?  Although I collected books illustrated by Bonestell throughout the 1950s and 1960s, I knew little about him personally until I found a trade paperback about him in the late 1970s or early 1980s, which gave a broad overview of his life and work.<br />The present book is a greatly expanded version of that earlier work, 256 pages versus 133 in the trade paperback.  Since that paperback came out, both Chelsey and his wife have died, but I think it is safe to say Chelsey's work is more appreciated than ever.  Here you'll learn of his childhood, his work as an architectural renderer and movie matte painter, and his entry into space art at an age when most men are thinking of retirement.  Chesley lived to be nearly a hundred, and was  able to compare many of his painted visions of other worlds to actual photos taken by astronauts and robots.  But none of these photos have the incredible artistic validity of Chelsey's own vision.  As many have commented, where Chesley's vision disagrees with reality, it is generally Chesley's vision which is the better.<br />For several generations, whenever anyone thought of space travel, or explorations of other worlds, it was Chesley Bonestell's vision they recreated in their mind's eye.  Few artists have ever had or could ever hope to have such an impact.<br />Whether you are an old fan or are discovering Bonestell for the first time, this is a rich feast of his art, which ranges from  architectural renderings to recreations of long-vanished Spanish missions of California.rtists have ever had or could ever hope to have such an impact.<br />Whether you are an old fan or are discovering Bonestell for the first time, this is a rich feast of his art, which ranges from  architectural renderings to recreations of long-vanished Spanish missions of California.	2001-06-09

Once one gets past the terrible pun imbedded in the title, this book is a wonderful throwback to the justice-figure pulps of the 1930s.  Doc Sidhe is the equivalent of Doc Savage in the &quot;fair world,&quot; a parallel universe where science and magical &quot;devisement&quot; uneasily coexist.  Here Doc and his assistants battle the fair world equivalent of Nazis,  neutralize a superweapon that could be used to conquer the world, end a plan to breed a race of supermen, and defeat a new-born Sun God in single combat.<br />The novel manages to open with a completely gratuitious sex scene (!) and never lets up from then on.  There's a battle every chapter or so, in true Lester Dent style.  Also welcome is the appearance of a fair-world equivalent of The Shadow!<br />If I have any criticism of this, or the earlier novel in the series, DOC SIDHE, it's that not all of Doc's aides are  up to snuff.  A couple come pretty close to being liabilities, specifically the largely personality-less Gaby and Ixyail. To balance that weakness, though, we have the fair world equivalent of Carl Barks' Beagle Boys, namely the Bergmonk Boys.<br />You'll have fun.	2001-06-04

This latest addition to the stack  unfortunately follows that pattern.<br />First the good stuff: the book offers a large number of well-reproduced covers from a wide variety of pulps.  The images are photographs (two are out of focus slightly), and so do not have the problems seen in several similar recent books which had electronically-scanned covers displaying a color palette nothing whatsoever like the actual covers.<br />Now for the bad part.  The text is mainly just a description of particular magazines which happen to be in the author's personal collection. Where the text departs from what is really just a catalog of the collection, to provide background on publishers, specific titles and authors, the material is so riddled with errors as to be of very limited use and  reliability.  So much of the text is clueless, every reader will have his favorite (and different) gaffe.  Mine is the  reference (p. 203) to &quot;famous American space artist Chester Bonestall.&quot;  He's apparently not as famous as I thought!<br />To summarize the contents: Chapter 1 provides a confused account of the origins and types of pulp magazines.  Chapter 2 is devoted to the very-soft-porn pulps usually sold from under the tobacco shop counter. Chapter 3 deals with detective, crime and gangster pulps. Chapter 4 covers the &quot;spicy&quot; pulps and their imitators. Chapter 5 introduces the weird fantasy pulps, of which the best and best known were WEIRD and UNKNOWN. Chapter 6 surveys the &quot;shudder&quot; pulps which featured heavy doses of sadism and torture.  Chapter 7 fairly casually dips into the huge sea of science-fiction pulps. Finally, chapter 8 shows us a little bit of the little-known world of British pulps and pulp publishing.  (About half the space actually is devoted to paperbacks rather than pulps.) Notable complete omissions from the book are the most popular  pulp genre, westerns (perhaps half of all pulp titles at peak), and the justice-figure pulps such as THE SHADOW, DOC SAVAGE and the SPIDER, which are the best remembered pulps today. Also largely ignored are the general fiction titles, such as BLUE BOOK, ARGOSY and ADVENTURE. With such omissions, the present book cannot be considered very valuable even as a pictoral survey of the pulp era.<br />Buy it for the cover reproductions and you won't be too disappointed.

The topic of Gratzer's book is largely confined to what physicist Irving Langmuir properly called &quot;pathological science.&quot;  In such instances, a scientist supposedly quite capable of doing valid research produces an incredible farrago of nonsensical garbage, usually being seduced into total self-deception by arrogance, political or religious considerations, national pride, or other influences totally irrelevant and completely destructive to the search for truth.<br />With so many topics covered, I think the most useful review is just an outline of what is covered.  Chapter 1 covers the most classic instance of pathological science, Blondlot's discovery of &quot;N-Radiation.&quot;  Chapter 2 discusses many crazy (and wrong) ideas from biology, including radiation emitted by cells, cannibal learning in flatworms, and the like. Chapter 3 covers the Davis-Barnes and Allison effects investigated and exploded by Langmuir.  Chapter 4 tells the sad tale of polywater.  Chapter 5 is a very unfocussed discussion largely dealing with pseudoscience rather than pathological science--- beginning with Mesmer it winds up with spoonbending children in the labs of British physicists Taylor and Hasted. Chapter 6 deals with cold fusion, Chapter 7 with various idiocies and surgical fads of medicine--- hardly pathological science, since science only began to penetrate medicine during and after WWII, but certainly pathological.<br />Chapter 8 deals mainly with the delusion that scientists in different countries do science differently--- one's own country, of course, is the only one that does it right.  Chapter 9 covers the horrifying destruction, first of genetics and then of biology itself, in Stalinist Russia.  Chapter 10 is concerned with &quot;race hygiene&quot; and similar perversions of anthropology and human biology, before and during the reign of Hitler, including the Nazi adoption of a crackpot theory of cosmology, the Welteislehre.  This long chapter then turns to the persecution of Jewish physicists and mathematicians, and specifically (non-Jewish) physicist Werner Heisenberg.

Kipling was the pre-eminent man of letters circa 1900, but pretty much unread today.  Here S. T. Joshi has assembled 17 short stories by Kipling, in chronological order of composition. Contrary to the book's subtitle, these aren't horror tales,  and many have no supernatural aspect at all.<br />It is notable that the stories grow steadily better as one goes through the book.  &quot;The Phantom Rickshaw&quot; is a total absurdity, but by the time we get to &quot;They&quot; Kipling, like Barlowe and Lovecraft in &quot;The Night Ocean,&quot; is looking ahead to the type of story that would be written by the likes of Robert Aikman in the 1960s and 1970s, probably the  ultimate (to date) literary development of the horror tale, before it backslid into the EC-comics imitations of Stephen King and Dean Koonz and other currently and undeservedly popular writers.<br />Kipling is noted for fiction and verse set in India, but the best stories in the book, for me, had nothing to do with India.  These included the before-mentioned &quot;They,&quot; and &quot;The Finest Story in the World,&quot; both of which appear to be based very loosely on real experiences of Kipling, and both of which seem to break genuinely new ground within their respective  themes.<br />S. T. Joshi contributes his usual perceptive introduction.<br />Recommended.	2001-05-29

Like a number of his recent Holmes mysteries, this one touches on the turn-of-the-century British entertainment industry, and turns on a real historical character, the legendary actor Sir Henry Irving.  Sir Henry is mounting a new play very loosely based on the Bram Stoker novel DRACULA, published only a few years before.  (It is more than strange that Stoker himself doesn't appear in the story, given his association with Sir Henry).  A series of senseless murders then occur, crudely staged to give the impression that a vampire like the one depicted on stage by Sir Henry is responsible.<br />Well, there's really no action, and not much mystery--- the most obvious suspect, after a few red herrings are dragged across the trail, turns out to be... you guessed it... guilty. The novel ends on an odd, elegiac note as Holmes, Sir Henry and Inspector Lestrade hold a dinner marking their mutual retirements.<br />If you've enjoyed previous pastiches by Val Andrews  (or his pseudonym Andrew North), you'll probably enjoy this one. If you are unfamiliar with Andrews' previous work, you may find this thin (125 pages) novel rather thin in all respects in comparison with pastiches by other authors.  For my own part, I enjoy the relation between Holmes and Watson depicted by Andrews... it seems to owe a debt simultaneously to Conan Doyle and to the long series of Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce movies.  And it's a treat here to see Holmes as a stage performer... even if he needs a lot of prompting.	2001-05-27

John Julius Norwich has been writing popular histories of the Middle Ages and Renaissance for about 50 years.  What we have here sounds like a great idea, a comparison of the &quot;history&quot; in Shakespeare's history plays beginning with EDWARD III (only recently added to the canon) and ending with RICHARD III, with history itself.  However, there is almost immediately a big problem.  Is the comparison to be made with Shakespeare's contemporary sources, or is it to be made with findings of modern scholarship on the period?  Norwich never seems to make up his mind, and the result is an often maddeningly uneven book.<br />In fact, much of the book reads as if it were a first draft. If I had read the excellent review elsewhere on these pages by &quot;jeffergray,&quot; I probably wouldn't have purchased the book to begin with.  Parts of the narrative would have to be greatly expanded for clarity, while other parts need to be compressed or eliminated altogether.  It is particularly hopeless to try to keep track of the important historical characters that appear and reappear in the action.  There are Nevills and Mortimers everywhere, not to mention Salisburys, Earls of Oxford, etc., etc.  Norwich continually chides Shakespeare for getting his Mortimers confused, but he leaves the reader in an even worse confusion.<br />The book has a strange prissy note that will jar most readers. For example, Norwich seems so offended by Shakespeare's portrayal of Joan of Arc that he can scarcely bear to comment, but Shakespeare's cartoon of Joan is hardly more unhistorical--- indeed, perhaps more historical---  than the absurd warrior maid who has appeared in countless plays, novels and films during the past century. Norwich also continually winces at Shakespeare's word-play, for example in the dialogue between Princess Katherine and Henry V, although both to Elizabethan and modern ears it rings quite harmless.  The real Henry V, a genocidal war criminal and insanely pious maniac, may have had no sense of humor at all, but Shakespeare's heroic Harry needs one, and it needs no apology.<br />There's a lot of interesting, even fascinating information here about a little-known period, but this is nowhere near the book it could and should have been.  Recommended with grave reservations.ay have had no sense of humor at all, but Shakespeare's heroic Harry needs one, and it needs no apology.<br />There's a lot of interesting, even fascinating information here about a little-known period, but this is nowhere near the book it could and should have been.

Right up until the end, this is one of the best Holmes pastiches I have read in years.  Holmes and Watson are depicted pretty much bang on, there is plenty of authentic local 1895 color in  various British Isle locales, and there are some interesting characters for Holmes and Watson to interact with, plus an  ancient, secret message for Holmes to decode.<br />But at the end, things fall apart.  First, Holmes' preposterous plan for dealing with the three villains would, in real life, have led to a mass grave covering the bodies of Holmes, Watson, their client, his son, and a number of Baker Street Irregulars! Second, the nature of the &quot;Devil's Grail&quot; itself is a huge, huge letdown.  But right up to these final pages, things move along well, and the entertainment value of the proceedings is unquestionable.<br />I do have one other reservation about the novel, but it is a reservation I have about fully half of the hundred or so novel-length Holmes pastiches I have read over the years. Namely, the villains act exactly contrary to their revealed motivations.  They want to find the secret hidden in the ruins of Glastonbury, but they spend half the novel preventing the one man who can find the secret for them from going there! All they have to do is wait until Col. Harden takes his photos, then steal them.  But instead they are involved in a hundred pages of nonsensical foolishness to PREVENT Harden from getting the info they need.  Then, with Holmes on the case, all they need to do is to wait until Holmes finds the Grail and take it, but insead they interfere constantly for another 70 pages. Of course, the answer to the paradox is that the author  could not fill his pages with action unless the villains  behaved this way!  But I wish more authors would try to find another way to keep the reader's attention besides having the villains act like the Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons throughout the book.	2001-05-25

Even as I write, the region of Delhi, India, is in the grip of a panic: a mysterious &quot;monkey man&quot; is attacking people all over the area, scratching them with long metal claws!  At least two people have died in a panic attempting to escape after someone cried that the monkey man had come, falling downstairs or off roofs.  However, in no case  is there the slightest physical evidence, either of an attacker or of an attack.<br />In what I believe is his fourth book, Jan Bondeson tells us  all the facts concerning a possibly similar case in 1790 London, in which the &quot;London Monster&quot; slashed women with a knife (or a blade hidden in a nosegay of artificial flowers, or with spurs fixed to his knees or his toes, or, or, or...). Was this a case of mass panic, as in India, or was it the work of one man, or the confluence of many otherwise independent &quot;copycat crimes,&quot; and was the man arrested, convicted and sentenced guilty or innocent?  Bondeson covers all the possibilities in an admirably even-handed manner.<br />London in 1790 was a strange place to modern eyes, and perhaps strangest of all was the almost total absence of any law enforcement agency.  In the rare instances that people were convicted of crimes, the death penalty was meted out for even the most trivial offenses.  In one of the most notorious cases, a starving woman  picked up a bit of linen, perhaps tempted to steal it, but lost her nerve and immediately put it back.  Observed by the shopkeeper, she was brought before a magistrate, tried, convicted and executed! Bondeson gives us all the needed background to appreciate all the circumstances of the &quot;London Monster&quot; case.<br />In fact my only reservations about the book involve its printing.  Only two fonts are used, a text font that  is quite unattractive to the eye, and an italic font which does not match in either size or style to the normal text font.  The very yellowish paper used makes the ink seem much greyer than it actually is, and the book overall is a very unattractive (and unfortunately very typical) university press product.

This is one of those &quot;bummer&quot; Discworld novels, lying somewhere in the bottom half of Pratchett's output.  This is one of those Discworld novels where the plot (what there is of it) evolves entirely off stage, and is never even summarized by Pratchett or one of the characters.  You have to guess it from occasional vague indications.<br />On stage we have the always boring Susan, grandaughter of Death, as well as Death himself, plus some time-wasting and always irrelevant  antics at Unseen University.  You will not be surprised at all to learn that with Discworld's equivalent of Santa Claus or Father Christmas turning up missing, Death has to fill in.  Nor will anything that then happens surprise you.  And most of it won't amuse you either.  The villain, Mister Teatime, is potentially interesting, but is given little or nothing to do, like all the other characters.<br />By this time in his output, 20 novels down the tubes, Pratchett seemed quite tired of it all, and the reader will be tired of this novel long before the final page is turned.	2001-05-19

Despite the large number of Holmesian pastiches around these days, not<br />many have been written by that fair sex which Holmes said was<br />&quot;your department, Watson.&quot; The few around divide into two<br />main groups, on the one hand, the orthodox pastiches, well worth<br />reading, by such writers as June Thomson and L. B. Greenwood; and , on<br />the other hand, the ghastly caricatures by perpetrators such as Laurie<br />R. King, in which Holmes is &quot;embroiled with women&quot; in a<br />manner that is both terrifying to contemplate, and absolute death to<br />any possible Doyleian plots or situations.<br />The present novel leans<br />in the latter, not the former, direction. Those looking for Holmesian<br />deduction and adventure must look elsewhere.  This book was originally<br />published by a small press back in 1993, and has been issued as a<br />paperback in 2001 I guess to take advantage of a small but noticable<br />current &quot;boom&quot; in Sherlockian pastiches.<br />Here a young<br />Holmes (at the start of his career) becomes infatuated with a female<br />counterpart who is (very implausibly) not only a violin virtuoso but<br />also a world-class magician who is somehow able to stage the Water<br />Torture Escape 50 years before Houdini invented it!

Years ago I read the biographies of Conan Doyle by John Dickson Carr and Charles Higham, and even tried to get beyond Sherlock Holmes by reading as much as I could of Conan Doyle's other fiction.  Therefore I thought I knew something about Conan Doyle as a writer and as a person, but Stashower's fine book  was still a revelation to me; it's not an exaggeration to say that  I found new insights into Sir Arthur on nearly every page.<br />Stashower has done his research, but he is also unafraid to use Conan Doyle's semiautobiographical fiction, not to mention his poetry, to provide windows into the inner Sir Arthur that Sir Arthur's own autobiography carefully conceals.<br />Sir Arthur, of course, created a character that (along with Tarzan) is one of the immortal icons of adventure fiction, a character as popular today as he was when his short stories first hit the STRAND Magazine like a thunderbolt.  One thing everyone knows about Conan Doyle is how deeply he resented the fame of Sherlock Holmes, but even here Stashower has some startling information to relate.<br />He is particularly good on the last couple of decades of Sir Arthur's life, when his seemingly mindless advocacy of  even the most infantile and transparently fradulent aspects of Spiritualism, and his output of nearly a dozen unreadable religious tracts, left almost all of his readers convinced he had lost his mind.  His endorsement of the authenticity of some photographs of fairies supposedly taken by two little girls (who had actually cut the tiny figures out of  very familiar magazine ads for Fairy Soap!), and his calling in a psychic detective to &quot;solve&quot; the not-very-mysterious disappearance of novelist Agatha Christie, were the final straws for even his most tolerant fans.<br />On top of it all Sir Arthur was a terrible judge of the relative merits of his own fiction, and anyone who attempts to read his entire fictional output, as I did some years ago and as Stashower obviously has, will see how sadly he frittered away and squandered his unique gifts as a &quot;teller of tales.&quot;<br />How could a man who created one of the immortal icons of rationality be in person so gullible, irrational, foolish and unworldly?

The somewhat claustrophobic action takes place entirely in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House, and  Pratchett is mainly out to satirize opera, opera singers, and opera lovers, as well as all the variants of Gaston Leroux's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.  The hard-to-take Granny Weatherwax dominates the action, what little there is of it.  The ostensible main character, &quot;Perdita X Dream&quot; as she calls herself, never comes to life for a second, or has much of anything to do in the novel's development.<br />There are walkons from several Discworld regulars, such as Nobby and the Librarian, but by and large this really isn't a Discworld novel--- that is, it could take place anywhere. It is difficult to figure out how Pratchett wants the reader to take some of the humor, and some of the apparently serious moments.  For example the villain has a long, operatic death scene in which he berates opera virulently, in a perfectly straight tone.  Is he speaking for Pratchett? Apparently so, since the omniscient authorial remarks about opera are in pretty much the same style.<br />Anyway, Pratchett is clearly having some fun with opera and it is unfortunate that the reader is not likely to have quite the same level of fun, to say the least.	2001-05-09

One is its homemade appearance, complete with unprofessional fonts, inserts of colored paper,  unprofessional printing and not much proofing.  (Some proper names are spelled differently every time they appear, even in the same paragraph.)

I first encountered Jack Crabbe about 35 years ago, and later enjoyed the loose and anachronistic film adaptation of the novel, starring Dustin Hoffmann, so I looked forward to finding out what happened to Jack after the death of Old Lodge Skins. Alas, Jack has changed a lot.  The latest installment of his adventures (to use the word loosely) runs nearly 450 pages, and to call it plodding and largely eventless is to err on  the side of complementary.  Bookended by the deaths of  Wild Bill Hickock and Sitting Bull, Crabbe's tale this time is largely about his travels with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The author succeeds best on the very small scale of specific incident--- Crabbe's interactions with Prince Bertie and Queen Victoria, for example, are priceless.  But by and large, the novel is just an &quot;info-dump,&quot; with dozens of pages of fairly undigested research narrated fairly humorlessly by Crabbe, interspersed with episodes of self-pity and a general and well-deserved feeling of worthlessness on Crabb's part--- he never finds work as anything more than a bartender.<br />As in many recent novels, such as THE YEAR THE CLOUD FELL, the plains Indians are given preposterous New Age supernatural powers, which fit  incongruously with the totally hum-drum and tedious events being narrated.  The novel lacks a villain, other than the odious Wyatt Earp, and he never really gets onstage, nor does he get a satisfactory comeuppance.<br />At the novel's end, Jack threatens either to die in his sleep, or to give vent to yet another 450 pages on events between 1893 and 1950.  I am afraid it is pretty much a tossup as to which I would prefer to see happen!	2001-04-04

Here's the latest in a series of books by Prof. Schecter on &quot;psycho killers.&quot;  I had vaguely heard of Jesse Pomeroy before, but knew nothing about him.  If you expect an explicitly scholarly work, complete with footnotes and bibliography,  Schechter's books are not for you!  But his research seems very thorough, even though Pomeroy's crimes began in 1871, when Pomeroy was only 11, and culminated in him being convicted of murder and sentenced to death at age 14!<br />One of Schechter's main themes here, to which he returns over and over, is that none of the current media, public and private reactions to child murderers are  in any way new--- everything we have heard lately was rehashed endlessly in the Pomeroy case. Schechter shows ample and depressing quotes from  1870s newspapers, speeches and letters to document this. Nor are child murderers themselves a recent phenomenon; nor do they seem to have become increasingly common of late.  Our inability to place this phenomenon in any kind of context in 2001 is sadly as complete as the inability of Bostonites in 1870 - 74 to  think usefully about Pomeroy and his ilk.<br />After interminable debate as to whether a 14-year-old should be executed, Pomeroy was sentenced to life in prison. He spent 53 years in jail, of which an almost unimaginable 41 years were spent in solitary confinement!  There he read every book in the prison library several times, and worked tirelessly at various very clever, but always unsuccessful escape attempts.<br />Almost every aspect of Pomeroy's saga is horrifically depressing. Tortured by his alcoholic father in the name of &quot;discipline,&quot; he in turn tortured and disfigured and ultimately murdered other small children.  The state promptly tortured him in turn, for four incredible decades.<br />Schechter is always able to turn up chilling documents, and in this case he has some notes passed by Pomeroy to a fellow prisoner who was also a childhood playmate, Willie Baxter. These notes, banal as they appear superficially to be, offer a deeply disturbing glimpse into the depths of Pomeroy's psychosis.  They remind me of some surviving letters from Albert Fish, as complete a whacko as there has ever been, and the subject of another Schechter volume.<br />Recommended if you have  a strong stomach and an interest in what goes to shape children who kill.se notes, banal as they appear superficially to be, offer a deeply disturbing glimpse into the depths of Pomeroy's psychosis.

I doubt that Fullenkamp has ever actually read any one of the 57-odd Sherlock Holmes stories and novels by Conan Doyle.  Fullenkamp's ignorance of late 19th Century British customs, culture, conversation and manners is almost total. [At one point Holmes refers to Queen Victoria, to her face, as &quot;Queen Mother.&quot;  And all the characters refer to one another by their first names throughout the novel.]<br />The author also commits one of the most unforgivable sins of the beginning writer who is not a reader, the sin known to novelists as &quot;said bookism.&quot;  This is the avoidance of use of the word &quot;said&quot; at all costs.  Characters never say anything, instead they remark, aver, inquire, grit, explode, answer, whisper... you get the idea.  Ordinarily this defect in a novel is fatal, as bad as Chinese Water Torture... you forget what is going on and wait for the next awkward synonym with terror and  disgust!<br />But now to the good part, which actually makes the said bookism fairly harmless.  Fullenkamp seems to be a born storyteller. The story moves briskly forward with no real letup.  You keep reading despite all the problems with characters, dialogue, plot and overall concept.  The motives and actions and plans of the stereotypical yellow-peril villain, Ming (who thankfully is never called &quot;the Merciless&quot;) make no sense whatsoever from any standpoint.  That Watson could consider Holmes a romantic rival for the affections of the lovely Miss Cantaville  (yes, even the names of the characters are a problem) is preposterous.  And so on.  But you'll finish the book, no matter how horrified you may get at the author's almost total ignorance and almost pure ineptitude.<br />Whenever anyone read any short story by the (fictitious) science fiction writer, Kilgore Trout, they were so overcome by the stunning originality of the ideas combined with the total incompetence of the fiction that they always burst out, &quot;My God, if only you could write!!!!!&quot;  In Fullenkamp's case one is likely to exclaim, &quot;My God, if only you could research!!!&quot;d write!!!!!&quot;  In Fullenkamp's case one is likely to exclaim, &quot;My God, if only you could research!!!&quot;	2001-03-04

But that's a quibble.<br />What images!  These were intended to get the farmers off their wagons and into the theatre, and they do serve that purpose. Have a gander at the incredible poster for I LOVE TROUBLE (39), a masterpiece in several senses of the word and from many points of view.  The poster for TOMCATS (237) exhibits a very poor understanding of human anatomy but it would cause any healthy male of any age to fumble unconsciously in the general direction of the fly of his trousers.  A number of posters and lobby cards feature the immortal Mamie Van Doren, protruding further than seems humanly possible (100, for instance) and Jayne Mansfield (for example 112) is no slouch along those lines herself.<br />I'd love to have seen a poster for BOP GIRL GOES CALYPSO starring Judy Tyler, but one can't have everything!  Highest possible recommendation, and keep those hands away from that fly.	2001-03-04

Watson	Books	2	7	10	N	Y	Painfully plodding, tedious, non-Canonical	In nearly 400 tedious pages, we get enough uncorrelated plots to construct four or five good Holmesian pastiches of ordinary length.  Holmes and Watson here do not even get around to questioning the major suspect until around page 215.  Neither Holmes nor Watson runs true to the Conan-Doyle form; often they spat like a pair of old queens.  As another reviewer has noted, Watson even commits the unforgivable (to Victorians) sin of addressing characters by their first names, about 3/4 of the way through the book, and consistently thereafter.<br />The book cries out for an editor, who could have carved a pretty good 200 page novel out of the raw material here.<br />The text is full of vexing misprints, typically several per page. Four or five are so extensive as to  render whole paragraphs unintelligible.<br />I didn't enjoy the book, and found it a real chore to get through.  Not recommended.	2001-02-22

Even when he recovers, he does little or nothing that is Holmesian and misses quite obvious clues.<br />Here Holmes is onstage throughout but again does little that is Holmesian.  Nor does the plot make a particle of sense. A man plans to steal a priceless jewel, but first goes out of his way to attract the attention of Holmes, then has to waste time in a preposterously convoluted effort to destroy Holmes' reputation and frame him for a murder, so that he won't interfere in the jewel theft.  Got that?  As in the first novel, the identity of the main villain is obvious from his  (or her) first appearance, so  the only suspense is related to how Holmes and Watson will foil his plans and bring him to book.<br />The author's research into 1880s London is good, but used mainly in several Watsonian wanders through the city, in which Watson always views and reacts to things as would a man of the late 20th Century (instead of the late 19th).<br />Some of the characters are colorful and effective, and the plot keeps moving along.  It's not a great addition to the  currently huge list of Holmesian pastiches, because the Holmes of this novel is far more a 20th Century Action Hero than he is the world's first Consulting Detective.	2001-02-20

German spies seem to know of Allied offensives before they get underway.  Mycroft leans on Watson to importune Holmes away from his behives, and investigate.  Soon Holmes and Watson are entertaining at an Army base near Stonehenge,  with Holmes on violin and Watson on piano(!).  Spies are quickly uncovered, and Holmes and Watson take their places, passing over to France, where eventually, flying over areas well behind the battlefronts (contrary to the title) Watson's sharp eyes and Holmes' powers of ratiocination soon reveal a dastardly scheme to win the war on behalf of the Kaiser!<br />Like many of Andrews' Holmesian pastiches, this is told in a leisurely fashion, with virtually no action.  In fact there are quite a few signs Andrews is tiring of the  whole pastiche business, including Holmes mocking himself not once but several times.<br />If you've read previous books from this author and publisher, you'll know pretty much what to expect.	2001-01-28

Although the back cover optimistically refers to six stories, there are only two present.  In &quot;On Active Service&quot; Watson tells &quot;young&quot; Stamford of his Mycroft-assigned job to dog the  footsteps of Lawrence of Arabia, to keep him from giving away to his Arab cohorts the British plans to betray them. In &quot;The Report,&quot; Mycroft tells Stamford about an earlier mission of Watson to Russia, to investigate the situation of the Tsar and his family, just before and just after the  Tsar's overthrow.  These stories make up only about 1/5 of the book.  The remaining material is &quot;backstory&quot; on Holmes, Watson and Stamford.  Holmes never actually appears  in either of the stories.<br />The narrative structure of the tales is almost absurdly  complicated.  For example, &quot;The Report&quot; is as told by Mycroft, but in parts Watson speaks in the first person, while other parts are in the third person.  It seems to me, as in the case of the author's earlier book ELEMENTARY CASES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, that the various parts of the book were written at widely separated times with no overall plan in view, and stitched together with the minimum possible revision.<br />With Holmes off-stage, the focus is on Watson just before, during and just after WWI.  Can you picture Watson driving racing cars as a hobby?  He does here, even though he is poor enough to have had to pawn his pocket watch.  Can you picture Watson as a rugby three-quarter? He was, here.<br />I think readers will be mainly interested in &quot;The Solitary Student,&quot; which gives some speculative details of Holmes' family situation and university days.  It's a good guess by Charnock that he would have started out studying theology, because of his frequent, quite peculiar theological references as recorded by Watson.<br />Don't expect too much here and you won't be let down.  This is in no way a collection of stories involving the adventures of Holmes, of Watson, or of Holmes and Watson together. It's more of a scrapbook than anything else.on together.

And this one brings Andrews' interest in theatrical history back to center stage.<br />A somewhat mellower Holmes is freshly back from the Great Hiatus (post Reichenbach Falls), and takes Watson out for an evening at Watson's favorite Music Hall... but the Hall has undergone an evolution into a Variety Theater (somewhat like America's vaudeville).  The Hall's owner brings a  seemingly minor problem to the attention of Holmes and Watson, but the problem soon becomes serious as several murder attempts are aimed at comedian and singer George Robey (an actual historical character, as are some of the other performers we meet in the course of the adventure), and Robey  simultaneously finds a priceless violin in his collection, in place of a copy he had built himself as a hobby!<br />The murder attempts, the violin, a mysterious ghost or ghosts haunting the Hall, and a number of other plot turns are all connected by Holmes at adventure's end, of course.  But the real interest here is Andrews' recreation of a vanished  Golden Age of British &quot;vaudeville&quot;.  I enjoyed it all.	2001-01-20

The review elsewhere on these pages by Scott Ryan is quite good and tells the prospective reader most of what he or she needs to know about this book, so I will contribute not a complete review but a sort of interlinear commentary.<br />It's a great idea to have the pre-Watson Sherlock's adventures written up by the &quot;young Stamford&quot; who first introduced Holmes and Watson at Barts Hospital.  However, Charnock has adopted a  sort of &quot;fundamentalist&quot; approach here, dealing mainly with cases mentioned by Holmes to Watson as taking place in his  early career--- many of the problems presented are hardly worthy of the mature Holmes.<br />There are some more serious problems.  In what I think may be  the first Holmes story written by the author, &quot;Aluminium Crutch,&quot; the narrator is Holmes himself (always a problematical conceit) and the &quot;solution&quot; to the problem that Holmes presents is a preposterous and completely supernatural urban legend, which cheats Holmes' client as totally as it cheats the modern reader. Other stories end abruptly, with more loose ends than the average mop, particularly &quot;Ricoletti,&quot; where Holmes  expends a page meditating on the social horror of a lesbian relationship in Victorian England, without clarifying any aspect of the mystery that has been presented!  Where the hell has the living yeti got off to?!?<br />One of the more interesting stories is &quot;Opal Tiara,&quot; which has obvious echoes of &quot;Musgrave Ritual,&quot; but achieves a number of fine twists at the end.  The &quot;Giant Rat&quot; episode has the problem that all action occurs offstage, and Holmes himself never directly appears.<br />Characterizations are good, the simulation of a Victorian style is adequate, and Holmes' conversational dialogue particularly sounds &quot;bang-on,&quot; in the fashion British pastiche writers often achieve, and American pastiche writers never seem to accomplish.<br />One of the better Holmes collections offered in fairly small printings by publisher Martin Breese.

As Dr. Johnson once remarked to Boswell concerning a dog being exhibited which walked on its hind legs: &quot;Sir, it is not well done, but one is amazed to see it done at all.&quot; Here are four Sherlock Holmes adventures penned by a 14-year-old British schoolboy. The introduction by H. R. F. Keating damns the stories with faint and half-hearted praise, which should warn off the sufficiently wary reader who picks up the book at the news stand, as I did.  Keating does not note that the stories are to be taken other than as perfectly straight.<br />However,  Hastie clearly does not intend the stories to be taken entirely seriously: Holmes is a parody who continually insults Watson and his own clients, while gulping large glassfulls of vodka (?) and  giving vent to maxims of  indescribable idiocy.  Sample: &quot;A murderer always looks unusually pale for 24 hours after his crime; as Mr. A does not look pale, he cannot possibly be the murderer!&quot; Holmes and Watson are always encountering diaries and letters which give away the whole plot. My favorite is a label on a bottle of poison, which goes on for half a page of  narrative text, explaining in detail how the killer has used it! Upon reading it Holmes comments only, &quot;It is rather badly written.&quot;  He makes similar comments concerning every document he reads, and one wonders if Hastie is foretelling and forestalling the reaction of the reader of this book.  Called on a case Holmes usually veers off at  random, often accusing the wrong person, and then finding the actual culprit largely by accident or preposterous coincidence.  When he is not insulting Watson, his conversation  consists of a combination of absurd bragging and pointing out the obvious.  &quot;Your name is Seymour.&quot;  &quot;How can you possibly know that, Mr. Holmes?&quot;  &quot;You are wearing a large name tag.&quot;<br />In 96 pages, we get four adventures: Holmes finds a missing Japanese prince, discovers who is killing the members of a family slated for a rich inheritance, uncovers missing plans for a new battleship, and discovers why a disguised cabdriver consistently overcharges his wealthy passenger. Each plot is potentially interesting, and a fairly serious pastiche could be written to any of the four outlines.

This volume, and a companion volume, DON'T DREAM, collect all the science fiction and weird fiction of Donald Wandrei, generally remembered today mainly as co-founder of Arkham House and walking companion of H. P. Lovecraft.<br />Somehow I missed the first edition of COLOSSUS.  This 2nd edition has two extra, previously unpublished stories and some interesting photos.<br />First the bad news: I don't know what kind of poet Wandrei was, but as a writer and plotter of prose fiction, he had some severe limitations.  Almost all of his sf was published between 1930 and 1936, and it is archaic even by the standards of that day.  He has three basic story ideas, which he uses over and over: (1) something from outer space plays havoc with human society.  (2) Uncontrolled scientific curiosity plays havoc with humanity and the earth itself. (3) A lovers' triangle becomes displaced in time, space or both.<br />His best known story, &quot;Colossus,&quot; is an example of type (3). It is also Wandrei's worst written story, in fact one of the worst written sf stories I have ever read, and I speak as a reader of &quot;The Blind Spot,&quot; by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint.  Typical sentence: &quot;His accumulated hopes, tragedy and undertaking of the day were above rational analysis.&quot;  Do what?<br />There are no real neglected gems in this collection; in fact, I had to force myself ot keep reading.  Wandrei seems at his best when he can throw plot, characterization and dialogue (none of which he can handle) to the winds, and spin wild prose poems describing the breakdown of &quot;space, time, matter, energy and consciousness.&quot;  This makes &quot;Finality Unlimited&quot; (he wasn't much for titles either), &quot;A Trip to Infinity,&quot; and the  previously unpublished &quot;If---&quot; the best stories in the book.<br />Wandrei ceased writing sf just before the dawn of the Golden Age of Science Fiction in 1939.  He tried to make a few sales to John W. Campbell's ASTOUNDING, but his archaic output had no hope of publication in a magazine newly emphasizing realism in science and characterization.<br />Here is a very minor talent.  He shouldn't be forgotten, but don't go into this volume expecting something wonderful. If Wandrei is remembered only as a publisher and friend of Lovecraft, maybe that is only justice, and his just due.NG, but his archaic output had no hope of publication in a magazine newly emphasizing realism in science and characterization.<br />Here is a very minor talent.

I can't think of any other film director who  approached James Whale's incredible sense of design, other than perhaps William Cameron Menzes.  If Whale is remembered at all today it is for his two Universal Frankenstein films, and THE INVISIBLE MAN.  I can still recall the first time I saw BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, with my brother, on the late-night SHOCK THEATRE program, in the late 1950s. Nothing had prepared us for the incredible, almost abstract stylization, the sly wit and the indelible performances that go to make this one of the greatest films ever made.  We were blown out of our seats.<br />This biography by James Curtis is probably the best look at  Whale the person we are going to get; Curtis seems to have interviewed literally everyone who knew Whale and would talk to him about Whale.  We learn very little about Whale as a child, perhaps because there was no one alive to remember  when Curtis came by interviewing, but otherwise we get a detailed look at Whale's show biz career before and after BRIDE.  Whale had difficulty finding worthy projects after the collapse of the Lammele-era Universal, and his final years exhibit increasing severe depression and strange &quot;post-menopausal&quot; behavior.<br />A recent film, GODS AND MONSTERS, loosely based on  events of Whale's later years, I haven't seen but perhaps it will awaken some additional interest in Whale and his films among the younger generation.  It is a sad fact that, apart from his Universal horror work, virtually nothing directed by Whale is available on video tape, not even (as far as I know) his famous film version of the musical SHOWBOAT.<br />If  you're curious about Whale, this book is the place to  start.	2001-01-01

It's a trueism that Shakespeare as a living, historical figure frustratingly escapes biographers.  The number of genuine contemporary documents that touch on his person and his life is surprisingly small.  As a result, virtually everything &quot;biographical&quot; written about Shakespeare tends to be a web of guesses and gossip.<br />What Honan has done here is to try to steer a middle course--- he speculates and supposes, because without speculation and supposition there is no story at all to tell--- but he is careful to distinguish those points where one goes  a light year beyond the documents from those points where one goes an inch beyond the document.<br />He also points out conceptual mistakes in previous biographies, for example the practice of commenting on the &quot;unusualness&quot; of some aspect of Shakespeare's domestic arrangements, without having done any research as to what &quot;usual&quot; arrangements at that time actually were like.  Since documents from this period have come to light with increasing frequency in the past 50 years, and even in the past couple of decades, it is a bit of a paradox that we know more of Shakespeare's times now than biographers did a century after his death.<br />The book is gracefully and clearly written, and I found gems and enlightenment on neary every page.  At present, I cannot think of any other non-scholarly biography of Shakespeare that could be recommended as highly as this one.  If you are interested in the man behind the plays, this is the place to start.	2000-12-25

Shakespeare wrote plays that were to be seen only as performances before live audiences, running around two and a half hours, on a rather small stage.  And he probably wrote pretty fast. Are the numerous inconsistencies (or apparent inconsistencies) one finds in the plays genuine errors of oversight, deliberate toying with the audience, unavoidable given the physical limitations of actors and stage, or part of some grand artistic design?  For any given play, the answer can be any or all of the above.<br />The authors discuss about 30 such &quot;glitches,&quot; and seem to derive most of their fun from summarizing how various Shakespearian commentators (few distinguished for intellect) have dealt with the glitches over the past 350 years. Sometimes, the authors appear to me to be deliberately obtuse about an issue,  perhaps because they had some trouble finding as many as 30 genuinely puzzling glitches to comment upon.<br />One comment I have about the whole matter, which the authors do not make: Shakespeare's intellectual and artistic depths seem virtually boundless, and every seeming inconsistency  might well have a reason for being other than carelessness or a schedule that didn't allow complete revision. The authors are aware of this, even when they don't state it explicitly.<br />Among the questions discussed: Why does Shakespeare's Henry V during the battle of Agincourt  twice order all French prisoners to be slaughtered in cold blood, yet  have &quot;full fifteen hundred&quot;  prisoners &quot;of good sort&quot; left after the battle, not to mention a like number of &quot;common men&quot;?<br />Why does Juliet say, &quot;Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore (why) art thou Romeo,&quot; when the problem is that he is a Montague? Why do so many of the plays end with nothing resolved, everything hanging in suspension?  [Notorious examples are Troilus and Cressida, and Love's Labour's Lost. The answer here is probably, oh say can you see, a sequel being demanded by audiences.]  How is Desdemona able to deliver several lines of dialogue after being strangled or smothered by Othello?  How can King Lear be more than 80 and Juliet only 13?  And so on.<br />Some of the answers were fairly obvious to me, although apparently not so to the authors.  Juliet falls in love with Romeo when they are both in disguise, and it is the revelation  that he is who he is that is upsetting.  He could be referred to as Romeo, Romeo Montague, or Montague, and the sense would be the same. The action of Richard II would cover 30 years or so in real time, yet the performers would have looked the same and worn the same costumes throughout the play, so Shakespeare has the characters proclaim themselves as &quot;lusty, young&quot; in the early scenes, and having &quot;worn so many winters out&quot; in the last scenes.  Further tipoff to this necessary compression is that where ever the dialogue would naturally refer to &quot;years,&quot; it instead refers to &quot;minutes&quot; and &quot;hours.&quot;  As the authors put it, Shakespeare has invented &quot;Warp Time.&quot;<br />The book is a great pleasure to read, and will greatly deepen your knowledge of Shakespearean drama, and your viewing of any Shakespearean film.

Over the past decade I've been reading my way chronologically through Thirkell's Barsetshire, with some long pauses while I tried to fill holes (missing volumes). Thanks to the Moyer-Bell reprints, enough holes have been filled that I have begun to read again... and then I came to this one, which nearly put me off the series altogether. I hope and think it is the absolute low point, and things improve thereafter. The problem is that we really see only two characters at any length in GROWING UP, and both are nearly unendurable. Deep in WWII, Thirkell seems to deliberately restrain the humor. The Mixo-Lydians do a half a page walkon, and a Mrs. Spender comes on in a kind of music hall turn to fill several pages. Finally, the always charming Mrs. Moreland shows up toward the end, to charm us a bit more.<br />But almost every page is devoted to the \\"feelings\\" (one can scarcely call them thoughts, as both characters are utterly mindless) of Lydia and Leslie, two young girls who each worry about a beloved brother off in some unknown theater of war, and each worry that they themselves aren't doing anything to help anyone. That's it. That's all there is in this novel, these two hopeless losers worrying about the same two topics. Over and over. Page after page. Ad nauseum. Lydia (Keith) has appeared in previous novels, and has always been obnoxious. This is Leslie's first (and one devoutly hopes last) appearance, and she is equally unendurable. About the only way I could keep going was to fantasize that Jack the Ripper would soon appear and introduce the girls to his dissecting knife.<br />There is one more problem that greatly hampered my reading pleasure. These Moyer-Bell volumes seem to be typeset at the computer by someone who transcribes directly from the Knopf first (and only) edition. Whoever that person is needs glasses, or a new prescription. Thirkell's supple, delightful prose is all but ruined by weird typos on nearly every page. Imagine \\"had\\" being routinely typed as \\"and\\" and imagine what that does to the meaning of a sentence! Imagine commas being typed as periods, cutting a long, elegant Thirkell sentence into two meaningless fragments. And so on.<br />Come the end of the novel and the only payoff is that Lydia has totally given up any hope of doing anything useful and--- I wish I were making this up--- has resigned herself to being a baby factory. We see her combing her hair seductively, although her thoroughly non-entity husband doesn't seem to notice, and reminding herself that they also serve who only produce litters for the war machine 20 years down the road.

First, the good things: there is a complete and accurate log of the CBS radio broadcasts of HAVE GUN,  starring the late, great John Dehner; and, there is a complete  and accurate log of the CBS TV programs, starring the late, great Richard Boone.  These are the only really usable logs in print anywhere.<br />Now for the bad news. At least one of the authors is so totally, completely illiterate that he cannot even transcribe proper  names correctly.  Virtually every sentence contains a garbled word or phrase.  In many cases it is nearly completely impossible to decipher what is being talked about. Even the many fragmentary interviews have this problem, since the interviewer clearly did not recognize the words being used by the person interviewed, and puts in either a ludicrous phonetic spelling, or substitutes an entirely different word with no connection to the one spoken by the interviewee.<br />Where a coherent narrative (i.e., sentence 2 having some  connection to sentence 1, sentence 3 having some connection to sentence 2, etc.) is required, the book falls down even further. Consider the several pages devoted to a complex set of lawsuits brought against CBS by an obscure children's birthday party performer who claimed the whole idea for the TV show had been stolen from his birthday party persona.  To say that this discussion is completely, totally and utterly incoherent is to put it mildly.  There is not a single sentence in the several pages where I had the vaguest concept of what the author was trying to say.<br />In short, this is a fan book, with all the defects that such books (which used to be mimeographed or xeroxed from an original manuscript, crudely stapled, and sold for $5 apiece at nostalgia conventions) always have.  It is tragic that no one cared enough about the material to have someone who could read, write and speak english work over the text.  Since the radio and TV  broadcast logs are relatively free of typos (apart from some names that are spelled differently every time they appear,  even in the same paragraph), it is clear someone did care enough about these to give them a once-over with a blue pencil.<br />What the luckless performers and crewmembers interviewed here, who now see their words minced into gibberish when they finally see print, might think of this pathetic book, I'd like to hear.<br />Worth buying for the logs, which take up about half the text, but don't expect anything else and you won't be disappointed.e names that are spelled differently every time they appear,  even in the same paragraph), it is clear someone did care enough about these to give them a once-over with a blue pencil.<br />What the luckless performers and crewmembers interviewed here, who now see their words minced into gibberish when they finally see print, might think of this pathetic book, I'd like to hear.<br />Worth buying for the logs, which take up about half the text, but don't expect anything else and you won't be disappointed.	2000-12-16

How to snap him out of it?  Mycroft, Watson and a glamourous figure from Holmes' past join forces to re-awaken Holmes' interest in &quot;mean streets&quot; with unexpected results.  Several Holmes pastiches (and an old play by William Gillette, which became the basis for the first Basil Rathbone Holmes film) have used the notion of planting fake clues to lead Holmes astray.  Here, Andrews works not one, not two, but three twists on this concept, as the clues are supposed to bring Holmes back to himself, and... could it be they're not fake after all?<br />If you have liked previous Holmes books by Andrews, you'll enjoy this one too.	2000-11-30

British journalist and magician Val Andrews has written too many Holmes pastiches for me to easily count, during the past decade and a half. Most have been published lately by British magic publisher Martin Breese, who says this particular novel is his favorite.  It is told in a somewhat more leisurely manner, with more attention to period detail and style, than the usual Andrews offering.<br />Holmes and Watson are basically blackmailed into a dangerous expedition to a little-known Saharan kingdom, where they wind up being buried alive in the tomb of a recently dead king! Despite the carefully wrought motif of Victorian adventure throughout (H. Rider Haggard is explicitly referred to), Holmes is treated according to the Conan Doyle Canon pretty much, although at novel's end  Mycroft is seen doing something utterly preposterous--- at least for Mycroft.  The payoff regarding a &quot;mysterious mineral&quot; in the lost kingdom is also pretty thin stuff.<br />In general I enjoyed it, and if you like other novels by Andrews, you're certain to like this one. By the way, magician Andrews has Holmes use a couple of sideshow magic stunts in the course of the novel; watch for them.	2000-11-28

It's a good idea, marred by inept execution and literary inexperience.  The three titans of WEIRD TALES, Lovecraft, Howard and Ashton Smith, accompanied by the Whore with a Heart of Gold that no fanboy fiction is complete without, tackle the invasion of Earth by Lovecraft's own Old Ones. There are a number of problems that distracted me from  enjoying the read: (1) Lovecraft and Howard tend to be played for laughs. For instance, Lovecraft lived off cold pork and beans in the privacy of his hovel, but his feelings of social superiority were such that he would never dream of doing such a thing in public.  And Howard comes off as singularly obtuse and clueless throughout.  (2) Although the real Lovecraft loved to vary his speaking style to suit the audience, the Lovecraft of this book speaks always in a &quot;precious&quot; literary style which the authors' own ignorance of English tends to turn into gibberish in spots.  Only Clark Ashton Smith comes over as a fairly well-rounded portrait of a real author.<br />The main problem is that the book has no plot.  If the aim of the transdimensional shadow men is to get someone to place the stone Loveman sent to Lovecraft into a slot in a cave, it  beggars even transdimensional reason that they do everything in their transdimensional powers to PREVENT the characters from getting to the slot in the cave!  Everything could have been wrapped up in chapter 2, and all else is foot-dragging.<br />Apart from the red-haired harlot with the heart of gold, there is another terrible cliche in the novel, namely the all-wise Indian shaman, who foresees everything, but like the  transdimensional shadow beings, has a singularly back-handed and contraverse way of helping our heroes!  I kept expecting him to say, &quot;Try not.  Do, or do not!&quot;<br />The adventure takes place just shortly prior to the real deaths of Howard and Lovecraft, and these deaths are woven into  the novel's plot or lack thereof--- some will question the good taste or lack thereof in forcing real-life tragedies into the service of a pretty juvenile fiction.<br />This is only a hair above the &quot;fan fiction&quot; that nerds, dweebs, fanboys and other losers used to circulate at science fiction and comic book conventions, and nowadays tends to be posted on fanboy websites.  There is even the requisite mention of nerd-fave singer and pianist Tori Amos, although this is thankfully confined to an appendix.te or lack thereof in forcing real-life tragedies into the service of a pretty juvenile fiction.<br />This is only a hair above the &quot;fan fiction&quot; that nerds, dweebs, fanboys and other losers used to circulate at science fiction and comic book conventions, and nowadays tends to be posted on fanboy websites.

The street word on this Burke novel was that it, like FALSE ALLEGATIONS and CHOICE OF EVIL, was spoiled by an excess of didacticism and a paucity of plot and action.  When I finally located and read a copy, which was not easy, by the way, I found the word to be exaggerated.<br />There is indeed a plot, which blends white-supremacist movements with the societal problems of stalking and  spousal abuse.  To help out old friend Herk and new friend Crystal Beth, Burke and his &quot;family&quot; find themselves needing to murder a couple of bad guys in cold blood and put all their lives on the line to derail a plan to level a Federal building in NYC with half a dozen truckloads of explosives.<br />Burke finds himself working with an enigmatic undercover figure who calls himself Pryce, and who is multiply connected to the local and state police, and Feds, in extraordinary ways.  There is a hint that Pryce may enter Burke's life again, once he gets a new face; let's hope he does.<br />In summary, this is another chilling Vachss tour of the underbelly of our society. If you have a strong stomach, it's a tour you won't regret taking.	2000-10-08

Lovecraft was one of history's great letter-writers, and many of his letters contain autobiographical details, so why not gather those all together?  Well, here they are, 343 pages of letters, Lovecraft's autobiographical sketch SOME NOTES ON A NONENTITY, and some explanatory notes.  The letters don't really form a coherent autobiography, and someone who reads this book without having read Joshi's biography of Lovecraft first will probably not form a very clear idea of Lovecraft's life.<br />Most of the letters are new to me, even though I am familiar with the contents of the multi-volume Arkham House &quot;Collected Letters.&quot;  Virtually all the letters are a delight to read, since poor Lovecraft could find entertainment in even the most humdrum activities... consider the wild Arabian Nights bazaar-haggling fantasy he inserts into the account of his  search for a good, cheap suit, after a thief made away with almost everything he owned in the way of wearables.<br />The text has one annoying defect; the letters are usually not introduced by telling us who they were written to, and one must repeatedly turn to a couple of pages marked &quot;sources&quot; for this vital info.  Lovecraft's tone and style, and openness or reticence, varied greatly with correspondent, and this is background info you have to have to appreciate a given letter.<br />Typographical errors are very few; I spotted only about four, all probably transcription errors in copying from Lovecraft's microscopically hand-written originals.<br />Like the majority of university press books I have seen over the past 40 long-suffering years, this one suffers from what Lovecraft himself might call &quot;preternaturally odious&quot; design.  The cover consists of a fuzzy snapshot of Lovecraft superimposed on a collage of details from old engravings,  and each major section is defaced by a grey blob that is probably imagined, by someone with no sense of design, to be decorative.  Chapter headings seem to have been affected by word-processing runaway, so that for instance the index is headed &quot;Marriage and Exile, Clinton Street and Red Hook&quot;!<br />Let's just say I loved every word of it.

Based on some of the Dead Sea Scrolls material, and with a lot of imagination filling in the blanks, Wise has reconstructed the rise and fall of a Messianic movement led by a figure apparently named Judah, about a century and a half before a very different and unrelated movement, Christianity, became well known in Jerusalem, in the form of a cult led by a character named James, who claimed to be the brother of the cult's little-known, dead founder, Yeshua (Jesus).<br />The Judah cult deteriorated in a particularly fascinating way, into a gang of border bandits!  We could wish that  other religions had such an escape from the usual tedium and dullness of self-satisfied piety.<br />I found this a fascinating book.  It would be nice to see similar studies of some of the five or six other Messiahs who were roughly contemporary with the legendary Christian Messiah, and who are mentioned in greater or lesser detail by contemporary historians and commentators.  If this period followed &quot;Sturgeon's Law,&quot; we can assume that the cult that emerged triumphant out of this chaotic fermit, Christianity, was probably one of the least interesting, least intellectually stimulating, and capable of the most negative impacts on later history... the MacDonald's Hamburger of cultic offerings.	2000-09-28

Lovecraft &quot;a literary  Copernicus,&quot; for his liberating of Weird Literature from the thrall of  hackneyed superstition.  But Lovecraft clearly spent most of  his time not  writing fiction, or ghostwriting fiction for others, but rather  corresponding with a huge list of faithful correspondents.  Many of these  correspondents would drop  Lovecraft a letter consisting of three  paragraphs and receive in reply thirty pages, written single-spaced front  and back in a tiny, cramped handwriting!  It was in his letters that  Lovecraft poured out his personality, his opinions, and his (not always  reliable) erudition.  The total number of letters he wrote  during his  lifetime is almost impossible to estimate, and alas only a tiny fraction  survive, but that tiny fraction would apparently fill around 20 volumes the  size of this one, if published unabridged!  If you love Lovecraft, you need  to read these letters.  I'd recommend beginning with the final volume,  containing letters for the last few years up to his death (1937) and then  delving into the earlier letters, going back to his amateur press days.  It's in these letters that you see the &quot;real&quot; Lovecraft, warts  and all... and these letters also somewhat paradoxically contain some of  his best writing on any topic or theme.	2000-09-16

Lovecraft	Books	4	41	41	N	N	Companion Piece to A Biography	This is a companion piece of sorts to Joshi's magisterial biography of  Lovecraft, delving more into Lovecraft's literary and philosophical  positions, and less into the details of his day-to-day life.  Unavoidably,  there is some duplication between the biography and this material.<br />Few  writers are lucky enough to have a biographer-critic who achieves a good  balance among sympathetic understanding, broad literary appreciation, and  unbiased dissection, but Lovecraft is fortunate to have Joshi, who does  have such a balance.  Joshi's lack of an academic position is, however, a  pretty clear indication of the low esteem the literary establishment has  for Lovecraft scholarship.  In the past 40 years I've seen Lovecraft's  literary reputation rise steeply in academia, but he has quite a ways to  go, and some academic critic who's looking for a writer to champion has  only to pick up this book and find a superb introduction to the writer, his  work and thought.

There's been a lot of debate over the past half-decade as to  whether pulp  collectors and pulp fans need a price guide, or some kind of guide, or any  guide at all.  Of course internet sites such as eBay may well be creating a  whole new generation of pulp collectors who are as innocent as newborn  babes, but the general feeling has been that nothing can be done or should  be done to bring them up to the mark of slightly having a clue.<br />Well,  this &quot;guide&quot; serves to suggest that no guide at all is better  than what we will probably get.  Here we have more than 330 pages which at  first glance appear to be  completely blank. A closer look shows, toward  the front, a  few short introductory essays in a type-font as big as  baseballs. There follows, for each pulp, a simple grid of oblong rectangles  that are supposed to convey some information, but what information they are  supposed to convey, other than that an issue exists of a certain date, is  completely unknown to your humble correspondent.  Take a simple example.  There was a pulp called COMET, which appears to have 5 issues between late  1940 and mid 1941. Was this an sf pulp? An aviation pulp?  A hero pulp  featuring a masked avenger named &quot;Comet&quot;?  Or what?  You'll never  find out here.

This is the final volume to date in Arkham House's decades-long effort to  get Lovecraft between hard covers.  With a literary style honed on the  finest 18th Century models, Lovecraft is a continuously interesting writer,  and this volume covers a vast miscellany of his output, from hilarious  dime-novel imitations written by the pre-teen Lovecraft, to some of the  last  heartrending notebook entries from just before his untimely death.

Lovecraft issued over the decades since  his untimely death, but many of these were privately printed or issued in  paper pamphlets of less than 100 copies total, since so many of Lovecraft's  friends were in the Amateur Press movement, and it was natural for them to  publish their memories and research through AP publishers.<br />What editor  Cannon has done here is to gather together as much of this material as he  could find, and give it the relative permanence of hard covers.  Although  the popular notion of  Lovecraft has him as a hermit or recluse, he in fact  had a  surprisingly large circle of close friends and an even hugher circle  of correspondents.  It is not a surprise that most of those who have  committed memories to paper are other writers, but in the case of  Lovecraft, one must particularly lament the absence of detailed accounts of  him from female friends. His wife Sonia wrote two short accounts of  Lovecraft and their life together, but they are fairly reticent as regards  personal details.... both are here, combined, and you can be the judge.  Even more disappointing is a brief note by the surpassingly beautiful Helen  Scully, who went on a date with Lovecraft in which he treated her to a  seafood dinner (!) and carried her to a cemetary where he proceeded to  frighten her into a panic! Her account can best be described as  &quot;extremely reticent&quot; where  a firsthand impression of what  Lovecraft was like might be hoped for.  I found all the contributions  fascinating, and bought the book even though I have probably 3/4th of the  contents already in their original pamphlet forms. Unless you are a  pure-quill, top-rank  Lovecraft expert, there is a good deal here that will  be new to you. Recommended!!	2000-09-02

The best stories are in the general  Gernsback-magazine genre of &quot;inventions gone awry,&quot; by a couple  of obscure authors I had never encountered before.<br />I found the  introductions and comments by someone named Wrzos fairly annoying.

Karon has taken a cue from Miss  Read, and from E. F. Benson before her, but has ruthlessly purged all the  intelligence and wit from her models.  In place of anything that might keep  a Read or Benson reader reading, Karon has supplied a relentless spout of  mild soap opera, and a cast of characters whom we are apparently supposed  to consider to be loveable &quot;Fools of God,&quot; but all of whom in  fact come across as complete retards.  Most retarded of all is the main  character, an Episcopalian &quot;rector&quot; named Tim Kavanaugh.  When  good old Tim is not delivering staggeringly mindless sermonettes cribbed  from Cokesbury tracts, he is cursing himself for his own stupidity,  something the long-suffering reader has already done far more colorfully  than ole Tim ever could.  Tim's wife Cynthia is even more retarded than  Tim,  which one would consider impossible until one has read a few  books  in the series.  In this latest book, Tim gets a double dose of soap opera  as he is stuck on a storm-lashed island full of the usual Karon retards,  while trying to keep track of what's going on with the original retards  from Mitford, his headquarters in the first four novels.  Note that  although set in North Carolina, the books have no black characters (except  for one token maid), no Jewish characters, not even any Catholic  characters.  There are not even any &quot;furriners,&quot; the most furrin  character having indetectable Italian ancestry.  Every person in the novels  is a good ole boy (or girl as the case may be), and they do love to read  their bibles, except for one character per book that hates religion because  of some childhood trauma. Needless to say, Father Tim bumbles around  senselessly and  offends the character even more, but by the last chapter  that character is a convert and is babbling meaning-free and terrifyingly  insane Christian jargon with all the other  characters!  What a guy!

I found each reader had a definite  dislike.  Some could not stand any of Pratchett's books that involve Granny  Weatherwax, but liked all the others.  Some could not stand any of  Pratchett's books that involve Rincewind, but liked all the others.  Some  could not stand any of Pratchett's books that involve Death as a major  character, but liked all the others.  When it was  my time to chime in, I  could only say, &quot;Ditto!&quot;  Any book with Weatherwax, Rincewind or  Death as a major character has a major hurdle to overcome.  Yet INTERESTING  TIMES, which  invoves Rincewind, is one of my favorite Pratchett books.  LORDS AND LADIES has Granny Weatherwax facing an invasion  from fairyland,  and it is far from my favorite Pratchett novel, but it has its points.  The  plot is interesting, the characters are well-developed and have something  to do, and the novel comes to a climax instead of dwindling away with a  whimper, as some of the Pratchett opi tend to do.	2000-08-21

Looking at my shelves I see I have a fairly substantial collection of what  might be called forensic pathology or forensic anthropology books.  And  this one is by far the dullest of them all... an inherently fascinating and  compelling topic reduced to painful tedium.  A typical account, without  much exaggeration, goes like this: &quot;I was sent a hand with the  fingertips and thumb missing, severed at the wrist.  After a while I  reported it was with 70% probability the hand of a female, between the ages  of 15 and 45.  The case has never been solved.&quot;  Repeat this, with  minor variations, for 200-odd pages, and  you have this book.  Many of  Ubelaker's fellow practitioners devote whole chapters of their books to a  single complex case, and give us a real feeling for just how the  information they provide fits into the big picture of the crime.  Ubelaker,  on the other hand, seems unwilling to devote much more than a page per  crime, which means that to fill out the book he basically dumps the  contents of his card indices onto the printed page.  The result is less  interesting to read, by far, than a stamp album!<br />There are, as Sherlock  Holmes would say, some points of interest here but they come few and far  between, and one would need the patience of a forensic anthropologist  presented with a huge garbage bag of bone fragments, mixed animal and  human, and none more than an inch long, to ferret out those points.	2000-08-21

Here is his take on organized religion,  and on religion in general. Both as a humorist and as a novelist  Pratchett's output is quite variable in quality, rarely reaching the peaks  set by such superior works as INTERESTING TIMES or MEN AT ARMS.  SMALL GODS  is above the average, and for Pratchett, that's quite good indeed.  Pratchett's hero, Brutha, is an apparently retarded and ambitionless monk  who's slated to become a new Messiah, but the leader of the established  church has his own ideas about who that Messiah should actually be.  Furthermore, by an incredibly unlikely turn of events, the God worshipped  by the established church actually exists, although He is handicapped a bit  by being incarnated as a tiny turtle.

As a humor writer and as a novelist, Terry Pratchett has his ups and  downs, with ERIC being the most complete failure among his 20-odd novels.  SOUL MUSIC is not at the bottom, but it is not far above. Generally, any  Pratchett novel featuring the character Death is disappointing, but this  one has major problems with ALL its characters, none of whom ever come to  life even for a moment. There is really no plot, no characterization, no  meaningful action, and at the end there's a non-ending perilously close to  &quot;why, it was all a dream.&quot;<br />Each of Pratchett's novels takes on  a specific feature of our own world, and the closer the feature is to mass  media, the worse the novel is.  MOVING PICTURES (about the film industry)  was bad, SOUL MUSIC (about the popular music industry) is even worse. The  satire has little bite and almost no point, as if Pratchett were so  offended by these media (as am I for that matter) that he can hardly bear  to dissect them effectively.	2000-08-19

Apart from John Wayne, there were only three cowboy stars who  hung on in  the late 50s and early 60s, before spaghetti westerns briefly revived the  genre, and created a new cowboy hero, Clint Eastwood.  These were Randolph  Scott, Joel McCrea and Audie Murphy. The films made by Scott between 1956  and 1960, directed by Budd Boetticher and written by Burt Kennedy, are  among the best westerns ever put to film.  What Nott has done here is to  briefly survey the careers of all three performers before  the late 50s,  then give a detailed look at their final films. His research is excellent  (I only found one error, the often repeated nonsense that Billy the Kid was  born in New York City or Brooklyn) and his writing style is coherent and  clear. Although Nott clearly loves these performers and these films, this  is not a gushing fan publication... a comment that cannot be made for much  of the output of this particular publisher. Recommended.	2000-08-14

To be precise about what we have here, it is a large-format paperback full  of well-reproduced photos, both studio portraits and film stills, featuring  the females who had the thankless jobs of screaming and looking terrified  in the classic horror films of the 1930s.  Apart from Fay Wray, most people  would have trouble naming any of these lovely ladies, which is a shame. And  some of the entries are a trifle surprising (Myrna Loy?!?). Each beauty  gets a brief biography, usually a couple of paragraphs, and then on to the  stills.  Everyone will have his or her favorite among the girls here.  Mine  is Francis Drake, an incredible but unusual-looking beauty who drives Peter  Lorre plausibly wild in MAD LOVE, and drives Boris Karloff plausibly  homicidal in INVISIBLE RAY.  The book is also fine for generating  enthusiasm to view films you might not yet have seen.  For instance in  which film does Karloff portray (very well indeed) two identical twins, one  good and one evil, and what actress portrays the impossibly lovely Thea,  around whom the plot turns? Recommended, but don't expect much in the way  of text.	2000-08-13

A good idea, but a somewhat strange book in execution.  It's an anthology of little-known works by various writers originally identified with the  WEIRD TALES pulp, whose works were later issued in hardback by August  Derleth's one-man publishing outfit, Arkham House.  Twenty-two writers are  included, and each story is prefaced by an essay about the author, by  editor Ruber, often based on private correspondence between the author and  August Derleth.  There are two specific problems: the works included are  often exceedingly minor and uncharacteristic of the authors; and, the  introductory essays too often have the dual goal of denigrating the author  and emphasizing the saint-like understanding and kindness of  editor  Derleth.  We're told that Robert Howard was a paranoid loonie with a  suicidal mother fixation (what news!), that Clark Ashton Smith was a  shiftless loafer who existed by sponging off friends, that Russell  Wakefield was a cruel, womanizing drunk, etc., etc.  Even the relatively  saintly Ray Bradbury comes off as a greedy conniver.  Most of the authors  are displayed at their worst in extended extracts from  begging or  hectoring letters to Derleth.  Interestingly, editor Ruber himself turns  out to be (since 1997) the editor and presumably owner of Arkham House;  what he does not turn out to be is anyone with a real appreciation of the  fantastic literature of  the 1920s and 1930s.<br />Like almost all of the  small press books I have seen in the past couple of years, this book has  seen no proofreading  whatsoever, and there are gross misprints on almost  every page, many of which ironically conspire to make Editor Ruber come  across as a total illiterate.<br />Arkham collectors will want this, but  other readers might give a bit of thought before purchase.<br />There's a  great dust-jacket painting showing Lovecraft's &quot;Outsider&quot; in  a  libary full of Arkham House books.  In more than one way, this painting by  Tony Patrick is the best aspect of the book.aspect of the book.	2000-08-07

So common has the Holmes pastiche become over the past 25 years that it  almost forms its own literary genre, apart from mysteries and historical  novels.  Veteran stage, TV and screen actor  Frankie Thomas wrote a number  of Holmes novels in the mid-1980s, including GOLDEN BIRD, SACRED SWORD,  TREASURE TRAIN and MASQUERADE MURDERS.  The series of paperback originals  was cut short when the US publisher went paws-up, so that a number of  Frankie's novels were never published here, although they were issued in  Germany, Israel and other spots overseas where there live many Holmes  fans.<br />Now the &quot;lost&quot; novels are being published in the US for  the first time, and here is the first of them, in which Holmes and Watson  tackle a baffling case that first seems to turn on shady international  finance, then on the whereabouts of four priceless oil paintings, the  &quot;Panamanian Girls&quot;.<br />If Frank's take on this genre is new to  you, I might mention that Frank's Holmes, although quite true to Conan  Doyle's original, is more like Doc Savage and The Shadow in relying heavily  on a small core of highly specialized assistants--- in this novel, one of  them is the legendary safe cracker Jimmy Valentine!<br />I found it to be  compelling reading and the turn-of-the-century English color and locales  seem authentic.<br />It's great to have these novels in print, and I hope the  other &quot;lost&quot; episodes will soon follow.  Highly recommended for  fans of the World's First Consulting Detective.	2000-08-02

Well, not quite. The book is really about its author, Robert Park, and might better be  titled, MY EXPERIENCES IN WASHINGTON DC, where Park served as a voice of  reason for the American Physical Society.<br />I fear Park has either been  watching too much TV or hanging around TV newspeople too much, because the  book is hopelessly disorganized into isolated &quot;sound bites,&quot; or  in this case &quot;paragraph bites.&quot; Does he really expect readers to  have a 30 second attention span?  Such people can't and don't read.<br />There  are a lot of villains in this book, ranging from sincere crackpots who have  evolved into evil, predatory con men, through members of Congress who hate  everything to do with science and reason, onward to  mediocre scientists  who have fallen into the pit of elimination of cognitive dissonance, etc.,  etc. While Park doesn't spare them, his scattershot approach means that he  never actually bears down on any of them.<br />Park's unwillingess to deal  with anything at length (e.g., more than a couple of pages consecutively)  makes his occasional attempts to present scientific fact particularly   incomprehensible, if not actually wrong. I don't think I could do better in  the space Park permits himself; but I might have better judgement than to  try, under such a limitation!<br />Recommended with severe reservations....	2000-07-17

But for me, and other Vachss readers I've spoken with, SHELLA is  the absolute peak of relentless horror.  Probably only Vachss could create  a situation where a child-like killer searches for the only woman who was  ever kind to him, and at novel's end when he finds her, her first words to  him are: &quot;Please, KILL ME! &quot;  And during the search the main  character, Ghost, encounters people and situations that would make Burke's  usual enemies look like the  regulars at the Tuesday Night sewing circle at  a Methodist Church.

Veteran Hollywood character actor Jan Merlin has  based this novel on one of the most remarkable experiences of his life--- his participation in a film called THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. The novel's hero, Kurt Mitchell,  undergoes a  year-long makeup ordeal identical to Jan's, and like Jan is  cheated of screen credit though he plays one of the film's key roles.  Apart from this Jan gives a vivid picture of the Hollywood studio system in  its dying days, and the horrors of location filming (Ireland for the actual  film, Brazil for the imaginary film that is the basis of the novel).  He  has also added a subplot  involving a series of child murders.  The whole  mix works quite well; as usual in Jan's novels the characters all come to  life, whether based on real people or not, and the evocation of sights,  sounds, odors and details is so vivid in each of the novel's scenes that  the reader seems to be there.  At about 200 pages, and with situations that  keep you turning the pages, this is  a particularly fine book for summer  reading.	2000-07-13

It gets off to a hurtling start as Ramage comes to  in the midst of total chaos, on a sinking ship littered with dead and  wounded, and is told he's in command.  He completes the mission his sunk  ship was on, to rescue some Italian nobles, and meets the Great Love of his  life, the georgeous Gianna.  Back at the base, he's  court-martialled and  it looks grim... but the novel switches from courtroom drama to another  rousing naval operation as Ramage rescues the officers and crew of a  wrecked British Navy ship. If you entered Age-of-Sail fiction by way of  O'Brien, this will be pretty thin gruel, but it is pretty much up to the  Forester/Kent/Woodman/ Lambdin mark, and quite enjoyable.  I was certainly  motivated by reading it to eventually read the other novels in the Ramage  series.	2000-07-10

As has recently become usual, there's  really no plot and the  motivations of the supposed villains make no sense  whatsoever.  Even the time frame of the present novel makes no sense;  references in a diary are essentially contemporary but we find toward the  end of the novel that the diary must have been writen about 15 years  before.  The diary, by the way, is the best part of the novel, far more  compelling than the (here purposeless) actions of Burke and his  crew.<br />Vachss retains his distinctive, spare style; it's too bad he is  apparently increasingly uninterested in providing content to go along with  it.	2000-07-07

If everything in Schechter's book can be taken at face value, Albert Fish was not just a serial child murderer, but exhibited every known sex perversion and a few unique to himself.  However, I have deep reservations  about just how crazy Fish was.  Essentially everything about Fish's  psychological quirks comes from one source, the notorious Dr. Frederick  Wertham.  Wertham was a gullible, naive pseudoscientist whose absurd antics  in the early 50s are well-known.  Since Fish rarely told the truth about  anything, and virtually nothing can be reliably documented about him beyond  a few anecdotes from family members, and since his only chance of saving  his life was an insanity plea, I am extremely unconvinced that Fish was  quite as incomparably weird as he made out.  Apart from that this is one of  Schechter's usual good jobs of research.  His real &quot;find&quot; was the  lawyer who defended Fish, who provided a large amount of detailed,  &quot;inside&quot; info about Fish's trial.	2000-07-07

Here's a new edition of one of the difficult-to- find Holmes novels written by Frank Thomas in the early 1980s.  Holmes and Watson tackle a difficult and confusing case that first seems to turn on shady  international finance, later on the theft of four priceless oil paintings.   If Frank's take on Sherlock is new to you, I might mention that this  Sherlock, while being very true to Conan Doyle's original, is more like Doc  Savage and the Shadow in depending heavily on a small team of aides, each  with a unique talent.  <br />There are some bizarre glitches in the printing  of this trade paperback, including a &quot;footnote&quot; that appears in  the midst of the text on p. 7, but actually belongs in a later chapter,  perhaps Ch.10. Chapter 15 is (for no reason) in a totally different font  from the other chapters.  And etc. Fortunately the story moves so well, and  events are so continually surprising, that the typesetting peculiarities  are not at all distracting.  <br />It's great to have this book in print  again, and I hope the other Thomas Holmes novels will soon follow.  They  belong on everyone's shelf of Holmes pastiches.  Indeed, they deserve a  special place of merit.	2000-06-25

What Jan Merlin, a TV and movie character actor turned Soap Opera scripter and later novelist, has to offer this time around is two short novels (or long short stories), both set in places he knew first-hand.  Both seem to  take place in the 1970s, though some revision has disguised this.  The last  and best is set near Hollywood and involves an antique dealer with the most  vicious, shrewish wife in all of literature.  When, thanks to Bramwell  Fletcher and Boris Karloff, the mummy of an ancient Egyptian princess who's  smashingly lovely and hot to trot in her revived form attaches herself to  him, and a weird rogue's gallery of neighbors,  things get funny, indeed.  The first story, set in the Philippines, suffers from being neither  comically serious nor seriously comic, and giving us no viewpoint  character.  The high-points are the glimpses of the soft-porn Filipino  movie industry. There shoulda been more!	2000-03-29

He may have killed his own brother, and certainly killed two  middle-aged women, but only when he ran out of fresh graves of middle-aged  female corpses to rob!

The history of H. H.  Holmes is so complex, and with so many gaps, that Schechter has done an  amazing job in managing to tell a more-or-less coherent story.  Holmes  himself never told the truth about anything, no matter how trivial, while  his own caution and incessant travel kept much of his crime anonymous or  undetected.  Even in his early days, when he maintained more fixed  addresses, his crimes were largely undetected--- there is no way to know  how many people he  murdered in a special building in a suburb of Chicago  during the days of the Exposition, when he rented rooms to travellers who  were never  seen or heard from again.

The only serial killers getting significant writeups are the  handful that Schechter had already devoted full length books to at the time  this work was assembled (can you spell &quot;no additional research&quot;?

One caution, the book is VEDDY  British--- the vocabulary will be somewhat incomprehensible to readers  unfamiliar with 20th Century British slang, although for this edition the  editors have had Mr. Lee add some explanations of terms in square brackets.  Also disappointing is Lee's reticence toward his old friend Peter Cushing.  One longs to hear the great stories of their friendship, such as their love  for Warner Brothers cartoons, and Lee's gift for mimicking the voices of  these cartoon characters, which he used to amuse the housebound Cushing,  via telephone.<br />Lee's film career, and life, have been varied and  exciting, to say the least, and all the variety and excitement is here.

There is at least one  place where a  quoted paragraph is immediately followed by a paraphrase of  exactly the same material... cut and paste didn't work.  The bottom line of  the matter is that the author really doesn't know what he  is talking  about.  For example a section (pp. 297- 301) discusses how the models in  THIS ISLAND EARTH were hung from trollys and moved past a stationary  camera, while the model in FORBIDDEN PLANET was stationary, and the camera  panned past on  an &quot;endless&quot; screw.

There is a lot of deliberate  humor, and it seems clear that a number of the characters are real denizens  of Peoria, depicted with their permission.  As for plot, a private  detective gets mixed up with one of the wealthiest families of Peoria, and  finds himself matched against a ruthless murderer who will stop at nothing  to exterminate the whole family. Farmer has deliberately and successfully  striven for a level of continuous action matching the pulp detective  fiction of the 1930s.  About the novel's only failing is a final summing up  that (as in THE BIG SLEEP) makes little sense and  leaves more loose ends  than a mop, and I suspect this is Farmer's deliberate choice.	1999-12-19

These lists,  which can go on for pages, are lists  of mythos- influenced authors and artists (some fictitious), imaginary  mythos books, imaginary artworks,etc., etc.  And when the author runs out  of mythos steam the characters endlessly list pop music groups and their  compositions (some fictitious), obscure horror movies (some fictitious),  obscure classical works (mainly fictitious), and so on... you get the idea.  The author, Pulver, has apparently been a music critic for most of his  professional life, and he never leaves the day job far behind. With no  characters one can give a dump about, no action, really no plot, and a text  consisting  almost entirely of irrelevant padding, this is one of the most  unrewarding reads I have ever suffered through.	1999-12-19

For each of 31 serials, none of them &quot;hard sf&quot; despite the subtitle, Kinnard lists credits and cast,  story, and comments. Often the story (a  nearly unreadable plot summary) exceeds 42 column inches (as for MANHUNT OF  MYSTERY ISLAND)--- for no known reasons--- while other serials get less  than 6 column inches, with no rationale.  I suspect the insanely expanded  plot summaries were added to bulk out a very slender book-- less than 200  pages of text.  Comments on the serials are repetitive and tend to lack  insight or specifics.  For instance, the gross overuse of rear projection  in FIGHTING DEVIL DOGS is not mentioned.  Misprints are few but often  hilarous, as &quot;Mephisto lashes Brand with a ship and stalks out of the  room,&quot; on p. 111.  There are odd errors, particularly phonetic  spelling of character names!	1999-11-28

This is a great book, because von Luck had the fortune (or misfortune) to be in every important theater of war from the very start of WWII to the very last days.  Luck himself is an interesting character, urbane,  cosmpolitan, making friends easily--- not your stereotypical Prussian  officer. If the book has any defect it is its great lack of  &quot;inwardness&quot; in the author's depiction of himself and his  activities.  In any event, it is a fascinating &quot;read&quot;.	1999-11-11

As a professor myself I know the problem... having lectured on the same topic for 30 years, you are  no longer quite aware of what you are saying... or that you just said it 15 minutes before.  Harold Bloom has  talked about Shakespeare so long to classes that his book is as maddeningly  repetitive as Chinese water torture, and as rambling and disorganized as  can be.  And if  I see the word &quot;rancid&quot; (generally used several  times per page, and always inappropriately) again after reading this book,  I shall scream.  But I know of no other book like this, a meditation on  Shakespeare's plays, characters and artistic aims that brings you back to  the plays with a whole new alertness.  Instead of reading the book from  cover to cover as I did, it is probably best just to dip into it from time  to time as you want  background on some specific play or character. Then  the author's crotchets and mannerisms will not be so annoying.  I did find  some of his  judgements imbecilic.  For instance, saying that it is  impossible to perform MERCHANT OF VENICE after WWII is like saying it is  impossible to perform RICHARD III since people in the audience may have  birth defects!  Lordy, lordy.	1999-11-03

There are Pratchett books that have only one joke, and stretch it to a limit far past most readers' patience, like  MOVING PICTURES, but this one has ZERO humor, it is about nothing, has no  characters the reader would care anything about, veers mindlessly from  pointless episode to pointless episode, and basically leaves the reader  cheated and annoyed.	1999-08-17

The most interesting character is a fruitbat, and that is a  sad indictment... especially since the fruitbat is offstage for most of the  novel.  I had the sinister missionary/doctor pegged as an organ harvester  by the second page on which he appeared. No surprises, not many laughs for  a Moore novel.	1999-08-17

The author,  however, does avoid one of the mistakes he made in THE ALIENIST.  Namely,  the villain is onstage a lot more and is a very compellingly wicked  character. The slow revelation of the family situation that created her  psychosis is the spookiest and most effective part of the book.  However,  the  villain is so much more interesting than the characters who persue her  that once she appears, the story falls flat unless she is in the scene.	1999-08-17

Page after page, we are told not only what it is like outside and inside a given building, but what the building  was used for 20 years, 40 years, 60 years... etc... before! Characters are  undeveloped; the &quot;heroes&quot; are unheroic underdogs, and the  &quot;mystery&quot; is solved by blundering, and ends in a preposterous  movie-type chase and standoff... just like the next novel that followed.  I  managed to read it and its sequel, but I can't imagine ever re-reading  either one.	1999-08-17

That's the case with the novel within the novel we face here.  When you add  in main characters that one cares nothing  about, and generally poor writing throughout, this is the pits.  RESUME  WITH MONSTERS is far better, funnier in parts than Christopher Moore or  Terry Pratchett.	1999-08-17

The contributions by various Ripperologists that conclude this collection will convince you that there are two or three  Ripper &quot;experts&quot; as loonie as the Ripper himself.  The one fact I  away with from reading this book that I had not previously realized was  that there were probably 100 males living within a couple of blocks of the  sites of the Ripper crimes, all working men who would normally be on the  street at the time of the crimes, who had all the background  &quot;qualifications&quot; of the modern serial killer. So what are the  odds the actual Ripper has ever been named or suspected by anyone?	1999-06-05

Ripperologists almost universally condemn this book as a hoax, but if you know a few reliable facts about the Ripper (as outlined, for instance in Sugden's book), reading this one is a good exercise in critical thinking,  at any rate.<br />Even if Maybrick had kept a diary and this was it, one would  still only be left with the &quot;fact&quot; that, added to Maybrick's many  other delusions and daydreams was the delusion (which eventually overturned  his reason) that he was Jack the Ripper.<br />The list of mentally ill people  who have claimed to be the Ripper is as long as the list of  innocent  people fingered by 20th Century  Ripperologists as having been the Ripper!	1999-06-05

Sugden uses original documents to cut through a century of Ripper mythology repeated at 3rd,4th and 5th hand by earlier Ripper books.  He also has no  axe to grind in behalf of any particular candidate for the mantle of  original Ripper.	1999-06-05

If I have one complaint about it, it is that it's over-researched... you can almost  hear Moore pull out the  index card every few pages, and say... 'it's time now to do women's  magazines.'  'Now it's time to do night crews at supermarkets.' And so on.  Also, in both COYOTE BLUE and BLOODSUCKING FIENDS, he seems to have  problems with endings.  But, hell, CB was only his 2nd novel!  His  situations are so funny and his observations so cruelly sharp that you'll  keep reading, even if things annoy you... such as the hero of BF suddenly  apparently dropping about 75 IQ points just so his idiocy can stir up the  plot.	1999-06-02

The author's &quot;voice&quot; allows us to saturate ourselves in the colors, textures, odors, sounds, and sensations of a trek through  wildest Africa.  I've never  read anything quite like this, in  terms of  transporting the reader far from the here and now, to a long-vanished  world.  The novel also tries to do justice to a long-forgotten historical  figure, the explorer Speke, whose untimely death and rivalry with the  much-more-famous Burton  have conspired to cheat him of almost all credit  for his incredible exploits.  But the character  you won't soon forget is  the narrator, &quot;Bombay,&quot; whose vocabulary and viewpoint are quite  unique to English literature!  Recommended!<br />The book is unattractively  printed and bound, with many typos.  The compelling nature of the text  keeps these from being as distracting as  they otherwise might be.	1999-06-01
