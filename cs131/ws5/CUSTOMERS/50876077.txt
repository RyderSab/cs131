I found myself wishing by the end of the book that I was one of those magical and talented people that had dance in their blood.<br />Caroline and Tom have a home that at times appears to be a three ring circus.  Caroline's sister invades their home after her husband leaves her, daughter Kay arrives engaged to one perfect man but in love with another and son George falls for the contractors daughter, who just happens to practically live there as well.  Throw in one small yappy dog and numerous other colourful characters and you have total chaos.  Through out the story the one constant that Caroline and her sister have in their lives is their love for dance.  No matter how difficult times seem once those dancing shoes are strapped on all is right with the world.  Is it any wonder this reader wishes to be a dancer? <BR> <BR>This is a truly heart warming story and I certainly hope to read more of Jeanne Ray in the future.	2003-01-05

Many times I found myself rooting for the bad guys and then smiling over some small act of kindness one of them exhibits to their captures.  This is ultimately a love story.

His wife has died in a car crash while running off with another man, his children are missing.  Quolye follows the trail of his dead wife's last days and manages to reclaim his two daughters from the man she sold them to.  Life has dealt Quoyle one bad hand after another; from dead end jobs to a two timing wife, it's what he believes he deserves in this life.<br />Enter the Aunt! With stories of Quoyles family in their native New Foundland, she sparks an interest in living a life totally foreign to anything Quoyle has ever known.  It takes very little persuasion to talk him into packing the family up in the beat up old station wagon and setting off for the wilds of Canada.<br />Quoyle is amazed to find that his ancestral home is a lonely old house, in major need of repair, situated on an isolated rocky point over looking the ocean.  Digging deep into his inner resources he amazes himself by finally finding a place in life where he fits, a job he actually does right and a chance to love again.<br />This story is filled with quaint and interesting people and places.  I felt like I was living right there with Quoyle and his family, feeling the bitter cold and rejoicing in the wild and oft times treacherous ocean.  Annie Proulx is a wonderful descriptive author and I certainly hope to read more of her work.  A definite 5 star rating in my opinion!	2001-10-22

This book was recommended to me as being a fun read and I found it exactly that!<br />Cat MacAllister is one very poor little rich girl who stumbles through life looking for the pot at the end of the rainbow...or a rich husband; whichever comes first.  I totally fell in love with India, Cat's transexual friend who kept me in stitches throughout the story.<br />This is no great &quot;meaning of life&quot; book just one outrageously fun story.	2001-10-14

Susan Vreeland weaves a truly wonderful story backwards in time, exploring the history of one picture as it passes from hand to hand and century to century.<br />This is a beautifully written book that tells the story of a single painting by Dutch Master Vermeer. Tracing it's movement from hand to hand, the author brings to life each individual story surrounding the owners of the painting. As a reader I was immediately drawn into each individual story.  <br />A wonderful book and one I would highly recommend.  I look forward to reading more of Susan Vreeland's work.	2001-09-11

While working on the story her personal life takes a turn for the worse and the story begins to jump from the past to the present.<br />I found some areas difficult to follow because of the way the story bounced around.  The premise for the story was good and I felt the book had merit though it was one that I personally didn't enjoy.	2001-09-07

I had noticed him mentioned at various times in my online bookclubs and am very glad that I decided to give him a try.<br />For those of you who love the suspense/thriller genre this book is a must.  The perfect crime has been committed time and time again until Joe Hickey picks a family willing to fight back. I was immediately drawn into the lives of Will and Karen Jennings and the terror they felt throughout their ordeal.   The reader is kept on the edge right up to the last page. <br />I'm sure I will be reading more of Greg Iles work in the near future.  Excellent!	2001-09-05

The resulting story follows Anna on her somewhat naughty quest for satisfaction and Dan's visits to his doctor for invisible ailments.  <br />I found this a totally enjoyable read though at times it was predictable.

I was not disappointed!<br />We follow Georgia's antics via her daily diary on a laughing out loud journey through life.  Angus, her mixed breed cat and a three year old baby sister add a delightful mix to the story.  Makeup, boys, talking on the phone, worrying about the state of her ever changing body; all made me realise how little some things change even after 40 years!<br />A must read even for adults.	2001-06-05

He writes the remarkable story of 3 women whose lives are entwined through generations.<br />Mr. Dorris has written three separate stories that join together through the lives of the three special women he writes about.  Rayona begins the journey in the present as she tries to find her identity as a child of mixed blood, Native American and African American.  There were times I could feel her confusion and anger as she struggles for her own identity.  Christine is Rayona's mother and follows in the second part of our story.  She also deals with the need for acceptance which she tries to find through liquor and men.  Sadness and personal tragedy appear to be as much a part of Christine's life as breathing is to most of us. Ida is the matriarch of the family and also the third woman who ties our characters together.  At times I felt Ida was the strongest of the three women and possibly just a little hard hearted.  Needless to say I was proven wrong before the end of the story. <br />Three generations of women, all struggling with the same need for acceptance and love in their lives culminates in a truly moving story of courage.  I have often asked myself &quot;What took you so long?&quot; as this book was recommended to me some time ago and I put off reading it time and again.	2001-06-05

She was descibing my son!<br />The further I read about the difficulty Icy had coping with her condition and how she felt going through it, the more I began to realize how lucky we were.  My son was diagnosed in the 1980's some 30 years later when this disorder had become more known.  So many of Gwyn Hyman Rubio's descriptions were right on the money.  I felt I was inside Icy's head and feeling what she was feeling.  How cruel those around us can be.<br />Thank you Ms. Rubio for opening the doors for others to understand this disorder.  I applaude you as a parent of a Tourettes child.	2001-05-17

The reader is drawn into Becky Bloomwood's world that for all appearances suggests a fiancial rollercoaster ride.

Julia's life has been totally dominated by the men in her life, first her father and then her husband.  She is perceived as a weak and breakable spirit by her husband Paul, a prominant Psychiatrist.

As our story unfolds the reader is quickly drawn into the battle waged against Vianne by Reynaud as well as the discovery of the secrets in each of their lives. Vianne accomplishes much by offering chocolat treats to the townspeople.  Her shop becomes a gathering place and a source of comfort to young and old.<br />The descriptions of chocolat confections created in Vianne's kitchen were mouth watering.  Readers should have chocolat on hand as they read or like this reader, will just have to pay a visit to the corner store.  <br />A joy to read.	2001-04-30

Despite the lengthy prose throughout I felt Joyce Carol Oates wrote from her heart to make the reader feel a part of the story.<br />This book takes us on one family's journey through life and shows the reader how one decision made by Corrine and Mike Mulvaney changed the whole course of their family history.  Throughout the story I felt a part of each family member's sadness and joy.  I found myself rooting for Marianne and wanting to throw something at big Mike.

I have never been much of a reader of historical fiction but this book has changed that for me.  Having been raised Catholic I was not even  aware there was a controversy in the church regarding her existence.  Have  since read up on the many theories and found Donna Cross has done an  excellent job with her research into this book.  She also leaves the reader  room to speculate for themselves as to whether it is fact or fiction. Ms.  Cross brings to life the deplorable conditions women of that century  endured. Bravo!	2000-01-17
