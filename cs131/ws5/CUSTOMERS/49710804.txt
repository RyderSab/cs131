How often do you stumble across an eye witness account that reads as if it is written for no one but the author herself?  There seems to be no bias, no angle that is being worked, just a short and sharp account of what two months in the newly 'liberated' city of Berlin was like.  It is a fascinating mixture of the brutal and the pragmatic.  Choices are made with great calculation and speed.  For instance, is it better to maintain an independence and subject yourself to the possibility of gang rape, or tie yourself to a higher ranking officer, but worry about how you will be seen by your fellow citizens?  'A Woman in Berlin' is a must read for anyone interested in the psychology of the survivor.  It should take its place alongside the classic accounts of the Second World War, from Primo Levi's \\"If This is Man\\" to \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" by Guy Sajer.	2005-08-19
US	49710804	R3IJ0DCIGW9F12	1400043395	813354201	Never Let Me Go	Books	2	15	24	N	N	Disappointment	First, I'll say upfront that I think of Stevens, the butler from Remains of the Day, as one of the great 'quiet' characters in the last twenty years of fiction.  Unfortunately, this only adds to the disappointment awaiting readers in 'Never Let Me Go'.  Ishiguro is trying to walk a fine line.  His narrator is very much an innocent, as is the way she presents her story.  Barely a chapter finishes without a sentence such as 'which reminds of the time when ...' which then serves as a leaden lead-in to the next chapter.  I think the main reason there is none of Ishiguro's customary lightness in touch present is because stripped bare, the plot's pretty thin.  This has never been a problem for Ishiguro before, but here, he attempts to hide various revelations that most readers will have already guessed by the end of the third chapter.  The denouement seemed to be ripped from the pages of a poor Agatha Christie novel - an old lady delivers a five page monologue to fill the reader in on plot points.  It might have worked, but already we knew way too much.  I kept getting the feeling that perhaps he was too successful in creating a lifeless world, a fair enough aim in creating the dystopia, but it leaves very little that is human in his characters.  And that seems a serious mis-step.  When I think of great dystopic literature, as in Orwell's 1984, it usual involves a character who struggles.  Never Let Me Go arrives still born, a very flaccid and frustrating read from an author we've come to expect more from.	2005-04-14

Told from four perspectives, the novel moves at incredible pace as it confronts issues of racism, colonialism, duty and family while never preaching to the reader.  Levy acheives this through the creation of four memorable characters who guide us through her novel.  The quartet vary vastly in their approach to the changing world of post war England, yet Levy succeeds in making the reader understand (and care) for all of them, from the patient Gilbert, to the racist Bernard.  Levy relies, above all her other talents, on her ear.  It's a novel driven by conversation and confrontation (every now and then you feel you're reading a script).  Levy is one of the only writers I can remember reading who captures a voice so beautifully that you don't hesitate to doubt its authenticity.  It's a feat for any writer to achieve this with one character, almost miraculous for Levy to have produced four such voices in the same book.	2005-03-22

Unfortunately, the admirable would have fitted into 200 odd pages, leaving the reader wading through an extra half a book.  Gaffney's done her research.  Unlike Kevin Baker's hyperkinetic Dreamland, Gaffney does a fine job sorting 19th Century New York myths from reality.  If only she'd been harder on herself.  Too often you'll find a moment of genuine drama slowed to an unbearable pace.  For instance, Gaffney reckons the middle of a life-threatening fire is a good time for a quick literary tour of Barnum's circus.  Instead of reading on, this reader thought the fire was a fine place to put the book down for the night.  In other words, Gaffney doesn't know when to let the story flow and when to occasionally indulge herself.  It makes the book seem heavier than it should be, unravelling all the months of research that must have gone into it.  Yet it's hard to forgive an author who strives so hard for historical realism and then punctures her own balloon with anachronisms.  Would a stable hand really think that he 'identified' with a horse 150 years ago? Whichever editor let this book slip out should have their fingers rapped.  Another few months of work might have produced something memorable, but you get the feeling that a book this heavy can only sink like a stone.	2005-03-17

Much rarer, it is also skillfully written, well plotted and satisfying.  Under the guise of 'The Star of the Sea' O'Connor brings together a ship load of emmigrants all seeking to escape the desperate famine of Ireland in the 1840's.  Most novels, most non-fiction, that deals with the Great Famine tends to examine England's role in Ireland's tragedy.  O'Connor reclaims the disaster through an entirely Irish focus.  Our narrators come from all stratas of Irish society, Lords and Ladies, Captains and Crew, Doctors and Maids, and the great mass in steerage, offering up new dead at the end of every day at sea.  By weaving together the lives of men and women from the disparate classes, O'Connor creates a tense forum of responsibility and fate that powers an extremely strong narrative towards a murderous climax.	2004-07-08

Although Robb has written a book that is both history and travel, politics and opinion, he is a more than able enough author to keep the reader turning the pages.  The prevailing question of the book is, 'What is Brazil?' and Robb entertains us by cherry picking historical anecdotes, then relating them to the political scene of the last 20 years.  It's definitely rich picking.  The presidency of Fernando Collor, which forms a healthy chunk of the book, is an utterly absorbing scandal, depicting a total abuse of the system.  Yet it is in Brazil's history where Robb is at his best, his detailed description of slave societies that formed outside of the 'state', the manner in which they were dealt with, sounds strong comparisons with the problems that both gave Lula his presidency and ensure that his hold on power will be hard to keep.	2004-07-05

Sebag Montefiore has dug deep into the archives and found an astounding amount of new material to chart the inner circle of Stalin's court, bringing the man out of the shadows and into the third dimension.  You may well wish he'd stayed in the dark.  STALIN makes for fascinating and often brutal reading.  Most extraordinary is just what a closed and cosy court Stalin reigned over.  Sebag Montefiore manages to recreate the lethal and intimate atmosphere that all who chose to be close to him were forced to endure.  Most interesting are the early days, long before corruption had penetrated the Politburo.  Here, the author uncovers the highest ranking officials taking trams to work, and Stalin's own wife begging 50 roubles off her husband for children's clothes.  The descent soon begins, and Sebag Montefiore follows its course in excerpts from Stalin's own archives and interviews too numerous to mention.  Every now and then, there is the tiniest slip.  In one sentence, an official is described as both bald and red headed, but that is pure pedantry.  It's hard to imagine a more fascinating biography hitting the shelves this year.  Be warned, it's a 600 page hernia of a tome, but take comfort in the author's ability to keep the pages turning.	2004-04-16

Perhaps Wolff has grown too old to remember what life in an all boy's boarding school is like, but the scenes of boys breaking into song and directing warm smiles at their loving Masters feels more like a treacly version of 'Goodbye Mr Chips' or the 'Dead Poet's Society' than any genuine attempt to convey the day to day happenings of an Eastern Prep school.  The nameless narrator is just one of a school crawling with aspiring writers.  Instead of a book of characters, the boys seem like slight distortions of the same reflection.  With a similar love of books, contaminating everyone from lowest pupil to headmaster, you could well imagine that you have been dropped into fantasy land.  School as a heavenly library.  There is, in short, no friction in the fiction, an almost total lack of drama.  Wolff puts nothing at stake, making even the threat of expulsion from this perfect world something that you end up thinking might be a boon  to anyone wishing to experience life beyond the page.	2004-04-15

I suppose I was hoping for great things, either Hiaasen's light hand, or Ellroy's dark tales of intrigue.  However, when a character takes a deep breath and delivers a one to three page sermon on, amongst other things, jade, prostitution or buddhist beliefs, you discover that you are not in the hands of an expert.  It seems as if Burdett had almost too much that he wanted to impart to the reader and rather than work pieces skilfully into the plot, he opted for dense exposition.  It is a shame, because Burdett can write well.  Sochai Jitpleecheep comes across as a well developed character and would have held the book together had he not been surrounded by a paper thin supporting cast.  Take your pick, the [attractive] FBI agent with a crush on our hero, the [prostitute] with a heart of gold, the evil millionaire sexual sadist.  Most of Burdett's secondary characters are little more than B-movie types given the odd line of amusing dialogue.  It's a shame, because Burdett does a fine job bringing the city and the culture to life.  If only he had found the right characters to populate his streets.	2004-04-14

Griffin, who has written a couple of historical novels, is on familiar, though foreign ground. His fictional stories seem to examine cruelty and hope and his first work of non-fiction is no exception. It's a mixture of many genres, all neatly rolled into a short, decisive book. The Caucasus is one of those places, much like the Balkans, which used to confuse me to the point where I'd rather turn the page. But Griffin keeps everything simple and clear, following myths, history and politics along the lines of an expanding Christian nation (Russia) and a defensive Islamic nation (what came to be called Chechnya, Dagestan and Azerbaijan). This book is obviously more topical than the author thought when starting it four years ago. My only complaint is in the inclusion of the author's own travels. At first, it didn't feel as if they merited belonging, but once you catch the writer's drift, that everything is really very close to how it was two hundred years ago, his aims become more and more apparent. Caucasus is blessedly easy to read, and that's no mean feat.	2004-03-25

Perhaps, as a Frenchman, Sajer had an inkling that what awaited the Germans would be similar to Napoleon's costly campaign in the previous century.  Sajer does not present a book of heroes, nor attempt to gild his own experiences.  Quite the opposite.  Most of the time, you feel yourself quivering in fear alongside him, standing guard in minus twenty degree weather, or holding your cracked hands out to be warmed by the brief warmth of a friend's urine.  Pursued by the Red Army and plagued in their retreat by vengeful partisans, Sajer's book is a stunning account of an army on the run.  For anyone who grew up watching Hollywood versions of the impeccable and efficient Germans, The Forgotten Soldier contains enough chaos and terror to make you smell the fear of not just an army in retreat, but a nation in collapse.  Sajer's writing takes a while to get going, but do persevere, because not only does his tale become more and more enthralling as it proceeds, but his writing improves.  In the moments when his unit are pounded by artillery or plagued by aerial assault, Sajer achieves an incredible sense of detachment that seems to have been at the heart of this one man's survival.	2004-02-08

If he doesn't grab your attention with an argument, then he'll resort to block capitals and depending on where you stand on the various issues approached by the book, you can find his call 'Off With Their Heads!' justifiable, offensive, or irritating.  Much of the book is hugely enjoyable as well as easily digestible, but too often Morris comes across as the class's know it all.  There's nothing he won't venture an opinion on.  He makes a good case for Clinton's culpability in the intelligence wars behind foreign policy and offers a credible enough reason (how could a man who dodged the draft feel comfortable sending young men and women off to war), but then he veers off the road in pursuit of less attractive targets.  His diatribe against the New York Times feels like a preemptive strike by a man fearing a bad book review.  Wherever he wanders, it's best to remember that this isn't really a book, in the sense that it's hard to find cohesive elements to it.  It's more like listening to a highly entertaining after dinner speaker who lost his notes somewhere in the back of the limo.  When he's on, he's on, but you're left cold by the chapters that seem to be scratching in thin dirt.  Whatever Morris writes, it's always readable, and he's worth ploughing through for the simple reason that when his machine gun spray hits, you really do stagger back.  Probably worth more of a flip through than a concentrated read, so my advice would be to buy the paperback, but do buy.	2004-01-23

It is, of course, both.  Harris won't be winning any awards for the depth of characterization.  We've got noble gladiators, corrupt politicians and even an innocent damsel who releases her captive songbirds from a cage.  Fortunatley, the plot moves so fast and so deftly, there is barely time to consider the weaknesses of the book as Vesuvius boils in the background.  Harris has the skill of a good historical novelist, little factual gems are slipped, inconspicuously, into the reader's path.  Whether it's the flow of an aquaduct, or the taste of a honey coated mouse, Harris is able to use his research well, bringing the cities of Southern Italy to life.  And though the same can't be said of his characters, if you're looking for fast paced diversion, you won't be let down by Harris.	2004-01-20

He's a man who you suspect is going to throw five dollar words at you, who always opts for the simple route.  This lends a friendly, emotional warmth to his writing that relaxes you, lets him sidle right up to you before you begin to understand that his writing is perhaps more subversive, and more aggressive than you'd think.  Dyer's essays can be genuinely funny, for instance, the moment while constantly changing rooms in a run down Miami hotel, changing again and again because of vicious mice, cigarette smells, and a French woman he finds sitting on his toilet.  It's all delivered in a paragraph, so quickly that you have to stop to enjoy your laughter.  The book sustains a naive quality that keeps Dyer's sense of the world fresh.  Perhaps his only weakness is that his prose is much stronger than his dialogue.  His dialogue can take ten lines to make a point, or reach the laugh, something he can often achieve in a single line of prose.	2003-11-18

You can flip the book open to any page and pull out something worth reading aloud and for that alone, I'd take my hat off to the man.  But beneath the distracting beauty of the prose is a very familiar story.  A good man returned from a bad war in a small town with a dark side, in this case, Sicilian gangsters, including the worst of the worst, a one eyed knifeman.  Sound familiar?  It is.  Gatreaux is at his best when he's wrapped in descriptions of the little lumber town called Nimbus, but the characters who populate it are prone to portentuous talk and symbolic actions.  We have riffs on Greek myths, serpents in beds, man mountains engaged in knife fights in rivers, but I found little to persuade me from the thought that Gatreaux was bluffing with a weak hand.  Namely, that at the center of the novel, lie a pair of brothers that he doesn't seem to have a handle on.  The war veteran has apparently killed scores of men, so that he is accustomed to doling out death in close quarters, yet over 95% of men in World War One were killed through shelling or machine guns, both distant intervention.  It was this, the blindness of fate, that you couldn't see who you were killing, or who was killing you, that was responsible for much of the pressure described as shell shock.  Gatreaux's veteran comes across then as a mythic figure, but the author seems to want us to believe in the grit and truth of his town.  I found it ultimately impossible, when I couldn't believe in the grit and truth of his characters, leaving the book with a hollow beauty, disappointing despite the promise.	2003-09-30

Apparently Mark Haddon has written for children before and, in his youth, worked with the autistic.  Whatever he gleaned from these experiences have been put to extraordinary use in the creation of his protagonist, Christopher Boone.  Christopher is, for lack of a better word, a detective.  Not your usual detective, but a teenager suffering from a neurological syndrome that makes him very good at math and science and rather confused by the rest of life.  Therein lies the strength of the plot.  The reader must stay awake.  Everything is supplied via Christopher's eyes and it is up to the reader to choose when to share the character's focus and when to concentrate on what might seem peripheral.  Ultimately, the plot becomes secondary.  Not to say that the solving of the title's 'Curious Incident' and another twist or two aren't fun, it's just that Christopher's eyes prove overwhelmingly addictive.  Haddon's created one of those rare characters that provoke sentiment without ever being sentimental, that you'd rather not see go.	2003-06-17

To help is to expose yourself to more grief than any man can deal with.  Ray, returning to the projects he grew up in with a pocketful of money, never fully materializes. We know him as a doubter (doubts almost every thought that he has) but his moves seems passive.   Ray gets coerced into making his offers, manipulated, even by his young daughter.  He is a watcher and a story spinner, but he doesn't have enough strength to drive the narrative.  Samaritan is more of a Whydunnit than Whodunnit. Price is interested in the psychology of white/black, adult/child, rich/poor.  Still, the weaknesses are hard to see since Price writes beautifully.  The depiction of the bleak urban landscape is worth the cost of 'Samaritan', but this book neither approaches the plotting of 'Clockers' nor evokes the pity and despair found in 'Freedomland'.	2003-03-15

The first and last pages belong to the character of Urania, a fifty year old woman returning to the land where her father was once so close to the seat of power, and where the single defining act of her life took place.  There is little suspense in her tale, it can be guessed within pages.  Worse though, Llosa cuts us off from her sufferings by presenting her as both icy and two dimensional.  However, the author's talent is on full display in the character who shaped the Dominican Republic, Trujillo, the 'Goat'.  To approach a historical figure directly is a dangerous path, but Llosa manages to creep inside his mind.  In doing this, he not only reveals the strengths of the dictator, but the methods through which power is retained and deployed.  It is a frightening portrait, never more so than when the man himself disappears, leaving the fate of the country balanced between his sons and successors.  The third strand of the book follows a group of conspirators as they plot to end Trujillo's reign.  While Llosa succeeds in febrile descriptions of torture and debasement, the very number of men he follows works against him.  It is next to impossible to differentiate between the plotters.  A little more time spent on the book, a harsher editor, might have turned 'The Feast' into a strong cry for freedom.  In the end, Llosa disappoints, but only because the themes are so grand, and because he came so close to achieving the monumental.	2002-11-24

Nasaw's biography of William Randolph Hearst is an easy read. That alone is quite an accomplishment. Like many biographers, you get the sense that the author is in sympathy with his subject, too much so for great chunks of so large a book. We hear detailed accounts of Hearts' continuous aquisitions, from art to newspapers to newspapermen, but Nasaw rarely seems to question Hearsts' grander motives. Was this really a man with a mission, or simply a rather large, intelligent brat? At the root of Hearst lies this question - How could one of the richest men in America declare that he only ever acted in the people's interest. Nasaw appears to swallow Hearsts' own political claims without a problem, that he was free from political affiliations and therefore free of obligations. Yet Nasaw ignores his own evidence. Again and again, we are confronted with Hearst acting out against individuals, corporations and governments with nothing but his own interests at stake. This degree of hypocrisy and selfishness are fascinating aspects of Hearsts' character, but barely addressed by an author more concerned with staking a strong claim for his subject among the crowds of 20th century historical figures.	2002-11-19

Unfortunately, the best of Dreamland comes to a sum total of about 70 pages in a novel closer to 700 pages long.  It's a sprawling, lazy book, the author attempting to throw everything into his stew pot and getting thoroughly confused in the process.  I've never read a work of historical fiction so well researched, so determined to show you the ins and out and anecdotes of a period, that then steps away from the plot itself.  I quote from the final pages, &quot;You want an epilgue, but who knows where people go?&quot;  Baker seems to miss the point entirely.  These aren't people.  They are his characters.  Therefore, the author should know where they go.  To drag a reader through 700 pages and then offer them a definitive absence of resolution reeks of literary trickery in a book that has purported to being big, open and honest.  What a disappointment.  If the author and editor had sat down and taken their time, perhaps something great might have been carved from this fat turkey.  Too often, the reader jars to lines like, &quot;a tram swooped down on them like a bird of prey.&quot;  Ok, so I haven't taken many trams in my life, but they don't tend to &quot;swoop&quot;.  Mr Baker hasn't learned to take his foot off the accelerator.  He speeds along, obviously without the faintest clue of where he was going.  How can that do anything but disappoint?	2002-10-25

The flap promises a story about a 'scam artist' and a story unfolding against 'the tumultuous backdrop of history'.  If you're expecting a tale of cons, along the lines of Mamet or The Sting, you're going to be very disappointed.  As for the tumultuous backdrop of history, although the story is well placed, after finishing the book, I couldn't quite find the tumult.  The character of the Real McCoy is well drawn, pained, amoral and fascinating and Strauss can sketch memorable characters quickly and effectively.  The problems with the book lie not with the excellent writing, but in the confusion of the plot.  Strauss keeps his hero moving around, jumping time lines, cities, wives but it is never quite clear where Strauss is going.  You keep waiting for a clearer view, or at least the occasional revelation, but they never come.  Strauss seems bored by the cons he does deal with and the finale is so preposterous that you get the feeling the author was attempting to milk it much more for symbolism than ratcheting up what might have been an exciting finale.  More unforgivable are the strange sentences of exposition that jut from the book.  Strauss must have worried about his readers and occasionally lapses into stressing his own historical correctness.  This disturbed me.  The joy of historical fiction is in entering another time, not constantly having the author validate his research.  Strauss is capable of writing most other young writers off the page, but this slippery book is an overstrained performance.	2002-06-12

How to be Good comes across as sanctimonous. Hornby attempts to defuse this with numerous asides to a knowing reader, but this can not prevent the book from resting on a small, poorly built soap box. The protagonists are presented as a normal family, nothing special, as the author notes. But he then fails to make them interesting, and that was unforgivable. He tries to conjure up a new world of possibility and good intention, but first, these thoughts are fairly common, and secondly, remarkably unexciting territory for a novel. I read to the end, because I kept up hope. After all, this is a man who made English soccer and record collecting edge of your seat entertainment, but How to be Good seemed like a loose idea poorly executed. It might have made an amusing short story, but stretched across the length of a novel, it's a windy and dull read that can't even be saved by a beautiful last image.	2002-04-22

First of all, it's just the sheer quality of writing.  Kennedy dances into, out of and all around the mind of Jack Legs Diamond, the prohibition era gangster.  He'll take you close to him, then appal you with his ruthlessness.  Kennedy is essentially trying to deal with a knot of myth and cliche.  Legs' story has been played over again and again in literature and film.  He really was the good-time gangster with the faithful wife and show girl mistress, the quick one-liners and aggressive ambition.  This may have appealed to a writer, but how then to humanize him?  Kennedy succeeds mainly because of the voice(s) through which he approaches the story.  Marcus, Legs' lawyer, is the perfect guide - people tell lawyers their stories and here, he has passed them on.  But the narrative is never that simple, flipping from waiter's anecdotes to mistress's yearnings, and all without losing or confusing a reader.  Kennedy presents an incredible portrait.  It simply doesn't matter whether or not he has figured out who Jack Diamond really was, for he has imagined an incredible three dimensional replacement of his own.	2002-04-10

Fate brings them separately to California where, against the back drop of the Gold Rush and the birth of San Francisco, the young girl's quest for her lover continues. Allende wants to have it both ways, to plunge her characters into a fairy tale world but deny them fairy tale destinies.  And yet the travails that they are subject to never convince on a literal level either.  The book moves at too fast a rate, never slowing to let the reader's mind believe in this distant land and so the book sits uncomfortable between the realm of magical realism and<br />Dickensian dirt.  Characters rarely rise above caricature; the sage Chinese, the worldly sea captain, the impoverished socialist, the whore with the heart of gold.  I found this book<br />disappointing at every level.  This is supposed to be the tale of a transforming journey, but the central character of Eliza is never breathed to life and the translation seems so pained and banal at times, that one wonders what Allende herself thought of the work.  It's the first book of Allende's that I've read, but if it is representative, you would do much better rereading Marquez.	2002-03-29
US	49710804	RCTTAA0F5HUOX	0375504729	940951301	The House of Sight and Shadow: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A disturbing and genuine love story.	You can call this book many things, a historical novel, a contemplation of medicine, an adventure, a tale of love, but the best thing about it is that it all comes together.  In the end, it's a book of thought, or at least, choices in thought.  This is what separates the two central characters, how they approach their work as doctors (mostly their work is gruesome, sometimes a bit too much so) and how the different paths that the decisions made in the mind can then affect the heart.  What you have in THE HOUSE OF SIGHT though, is a romance that is made fragile by all the machinations of the characters who operate inside and outside of it.  In the end, the book is driven by these differences that separate the heart and the mind.  They may be choices that we all face, but this is exactly what makes a book set 250 years ago in England, seem relevant.  Plus it kept me up at night, and I read it on holiday in London, which was a bonus.  It was recommended to me by a Mystery Bookshop, but I'd have to say it's not really a mystery, not like a whodunnit, but more subtle.  The ultimate revelations may be just as clear and shocking as in a mystery, but they have a rawness that means they side step the usual contrived ending.	2001-05-01

As in Gates of Fire, the author is able to conjure the visceral world of ancient warfare .  However, the Tides of War falls short of his previous effort for several  reasons.  Though there can be no doubt that war was often fought as much  for honor as for territorial acquisition, Pressfield fails to convince as  to exactly how such an appreciation of war might outlive the first taste of  carnage.  Again, when Pressfield nails a metaphor, you can glimpse Homer,  when he fails, you're tempted to break into laughter.  In the end, if  you're going to write historical books that deal with particularly bloody  moments in history, surely the better bet is to present the carnage and  leave the reader to interpret it.  In the last months, both Rambaud's The  Battle and Griffin's The Requiem Shark have achieved this.  Pressfield, for  the moment, seems to have run out of steam, his characters undoubtedly  flatter than in his previous novel.  I suspect that we'll be presented with  a third of his Greek sword and sandals within a year or two.  Perhaps he'll  return to the glories of Gates of Fire, or perhaps his pen will get the  better of him and we'll be swamped in purple prose.	2000-06-01

Some books depend on plot, some on technique, some on character, but Meely LaBauve is a book that succeeds on tone.  It's the pitch of Meely's voice that wins over a reader, drags you down immediately into the world of the  bayou and holds you there for an all too brief trip.  Wells manages to  combine endurance, youth, humor and pathos in his teenage protagonist.   There's no point comparing it to Catcher in the Rye, so let it stand on  it's own since it's more than capable of doing so.	2000-05-16

Using a challenging technique of sharing the narrative between around twenty different characters, Matthew Kneale has made an ambitious attempt to inject a balanced realism into his book.  The central problem is that  the novel is ultimately undecided in its intentions and leaves the reader  uneasy.  While straining for verity in some scenes, others are rendered in  a spirit of high camp.  This may be possible, and at times the tones ARE  perfect (the voice of the young aborigine struck me as particularly  convincing), but Kneale's true problem lies in the changes, or lack  thereof, that his characters undergo.  We are presented with stereotypes,  the self righteous clergyman, the sanguine doctor, the dissipated youth and  while they begin the book as both colorful and entertaining, their traits  are merely exaggerated, never developed or changed.  This eventually takes  what I was considering one of the best books of the year and reduces  Kneale, in my eyes, to a writer of immense promise, a novel or two away  from perfection.	2000-05-12

A friend who had read both O'Brian's books and the Requiem Shark, bought this book for me and while the style is very different from the old  master's, it is every bit as good.  Griffin takes as his subject a young  man, around 19, who makes one mistake (stepping aboard the wrong vessel)  and then follows him closely during the next three years as his character  is transformed by those about him.  I know it sounds a bit like Lord Jim  but Griffin is crueller than most, pushing his heroes and antiheroes  through a miserable life on the seas that had me transfixed.  There is also  a character aboard called Innocent, who has concocted his own religion out  of Greek myths and the bible that seems to emphasise the power of stories  themselves.  The book also ends in a series of twists that were about as  bitter and enjoyable as they come.	2000-04-25

I think that when it is well written, the result can be staggering, not only taking a reader inside a character's mind, but inside a different time and world.  This  happens to be one of those books.  Harrigan retells that old story of the  Alamo we all know so well, slipping in enough historical detail to be  absolutely convincing, yet never halting the momentum of his book.  It  reminded me of another piece of historical fiction I'd just finished, The  Requiem Shark, both books dealing with hackneyed subjects (the Alamo and  Piracy) and yet they're almost as well written as my number one author,  Patrick O'Brian.  I say almost, because O'Brian is the true king of  historical fiction.  It doesn't hurt that he wrote for over fifty years,  and hopefully Harrigan will be around at least as long.	2000-04-11
