After an easy to follow overview on the tools: Linear Programming (Simplex) and Mixed Integer Programming (with an appendix over the Branch and Bound method), these fundamentals are applied to strategic and tactical issues related to modeling the SC. Some actual applications together with their outcomes make examples more credible and dowm to earth. Examples run on excel´s solver are strightforward and useful to get a basic handle on the topic.<br />Several chapters on an unified optimization methodology for planning SC problems and databases are also interesting. The book ends up with a reviw on how decisions are taken within an organization and the role of modeling and optimization techniques. Its plain english is another positive point.<br />My only &quot;but&quot; could be an overly superficial treatment of hot topics in SC as facilities location whereas covering issues as Corporate Financial Planning far from the core of the book. All in all a profitable bought.	2003-03-16

It is amazing that the outcome of reading Herodotus, Xenophon, Machiavello, Sun Tzi, Tito Livio and so forth is something like USA must be a soft empire for our own interest (even if we are not american).<BR>Apart from some logical statements as that developed political structures, economical stability and social control are necessary for real human rights empire and democracy implementation, the rest of conclusions are a fuzzy mess of warped opinions. I am afraid that this the typical &quot;uncontestable truth&quot; looking for ways to be demostrated. If so, that messy arguments from Kaplan fall short. <br />I hope that not all the readers of those classical books get the same. If something can be deduced from Classicals is that the world will be what we want it to be. Ask it to Julio Cesar, Gengis Kan, and so on by force and intelligence or Rosseau and  Aritoteles by teaching. Have not they changed the world and the minds?. If author is speaking about human rights is because someone made up those concepts and other achieved them for him.<br />I expected a less USA-centered thinking from a man that has travelled so much. The support from Kissinger at the cover should have warned me before buying the book.	2002-09-25

From shock to shock, the author discovers that services and activities considered as granted are not so in other places. Bureaucracy to the most absurd limits, supposed to be modern culture imposed to a tribal mood (as a beauty miss election almost in the forest) and even the return to the civilization are oportunities for amazing and funny histories. <br />It is a real way to discover &quot;the others&quot; that are, at bottom, so close to us (as when the boss of the tribe excused for not accompanying him back to U.K. because as every one knows it is afreezing weather, there are dangerous animals as the dogs in the catholic mision and cannibals abound (exactly the same told by his mother in U.K.) <br />All in all, I was expecting for some conclusions on the disaster of imposing our way of development on tribal and undeveloped countries and other way of doing it but maybe this was not the book for such kind of thoughts.	2002-09-25

Books	5	6	6	N	N	A delighting trip over our past	A look at our past is a look at out past wars. All over the history, civilizations, kingdoms and states have emerged, survived or obliterated based in their skill to win battle after battle (not only at the battlefields but also at the political arena). I am afraid it´s not different nowdays.<br />It´s interesting to have a look at gifted generals whose best skill was to know the timely place and time for fighting and their pursuit of decesive wins. Overall, victory depends usually in just one man with his skills and shortcomings.<br />I love this book on account of its global outlook of wars as one of the weapons in the array of ancient leaders. Demografy, economy or beliefs are key factor that great generals were able to tip in their favor.<br />In this book, the author is bent on placing each leader or general into political, economical and social context. It is not only a catalogue of wars, outflaking movements and so on. There are plently of examples of great generals almost ever-winner that could not overcome other factors and eventually were defeated (as Anibal or Espartacus) by enemies, comrades or chiefs. On the contrary how geniuos as Julio Cesar or Escipion africanus could innovate and emerged victorious against all hurdles by fair means or fouls.<br />In the list of gifted people, there were really little known people who made great exploits (as Lucullus, the brother of Anibal and so on). Many factors drive life and glory and not always the best or better is the winner.<br />This book must be thought of as a global modern view that places each name and battle in a place in History and that directs you  into reading ancient sorces of much narrow scope and less reliable but closer to real facts: Xenophon, Arrio, Julio Cesar, tuciddides and so many which are shed with a different light under a more encopassing view.<br />All in all, a pleasure to enjoy. By the way, how different in the real story of Spartacus from the famous film. Men, with our mistakes are the best sources or our grievances.	2002-05-14

Its well organized and starts out by the basics as coordination mechanisms and dives into the driving forces (internal and externals) through all the literature available by that time.<BR>Its final explanation of the structure as the outcome of forces and drives shed insight into structure as an outcome (affected even by fashions). This envision is clear even if new forces are uncovered by the experts.<BR>On the drawbacks side, the book is slightly out of date regarding the research background for a nowdays reader(not its fault since the book is 20 years old), some chapters as the impact of some factors in structuring are padded out and the human being behavior impact is lightly treated. Some outlooks have failed (20 aditional years gives you some &quot;foresight&quot; to see why they went wrong, which is funny). <BR>All in all, even if its slightly outdated, it is worth to have a go at it. Its easy to read and offer a good overview.	2001-12-11

It goes through the key topics as conjugate priors, MCMC methods (non iteratives and iteratives as the well known Gibbs samplining and metropolitis hastings algorithms), model selection methods (as bayes factor) and issues related as model robusteness.<BR>The Approach is increasingly formal and deeply complex, allowing for getting the basics or diving into more complex knowledge according to your former background. You need at least a good understanding of Frequentist statistic to be able to follow the reasonings. Each chapter allow you to stop at some point without losing the thread. Last part of the book is in fact deep knowledge demanding.<BR>The most interesting point of this book according to my very limited statistics background is that it makes good comparations with the frequentist approach (classical approaches as confidence intervals and point estimators), checking performance of either method. Even, it features some combination of both approaches getting some bayessian intervals.<BR>As a negative point, I would say that examples are hard to follow for someone with limited bakground and too much complex. They really do not clear me up enough.<BR>All in all, is a very profitable book for jumping into bayesian methods.	2001-11-20

Advantages and pitfalls of simplicity are outlined and some paths featured. Nevertheless, as its common, when you end up the chapters little remains. The book is too much dense and padded out. Its a contradiction with the issue of the book. There are 10 rules at the end that summarise the ideas. If some pages with the useful points were added on to this summary, the book could be reduced to 50 useful pages. Its a pity not to practice what one preaches.

This is another way to express the old saying: think about what the customer is interested in (the outcome of the process), not about your internal issues (as departments, task, hierarchy and so on. Since Drucker and even sooner this is not new. Even more ennoying is its presumptuous writting. They appoint themselves as overcomers of Adam Smith and his job division. The worst consequence is that many companies have used this book as the rational for downsizing.

They can not be prompted by cheese. If what this tale wants to support is that a worker always must be profitable and his past services are not worthy any longer, that is not new nowdays. Each one must try to update his knowledge everyday to be profitable, but the company also bears some responsability. Its easy to get the maximun outcome from people, not investing on them in their training on new tools and years later discover that the worker is outdated.

Nevertheless, dinamic models through bayesian forecasting are afordable with this book. Introductory chapters on the bayesian learning algorithm and univariate models rough out the kernel of the issue. Once you dive into the following more complicated chapters you can get lost but the main idea is got. To avoid getting lost, several readings are necessary. Finally, last chapters for non linear  models, models with exponential distributions and MCMC methods are really heavy going but a light reading can allow you to get a general overview.<br />All in all, is a great workbook.

From my humble point of view, all books like this, look at &quot;the good and rational background&quot; of people. They have the premise that all the staff is doing their best but &quot;strange forces&quot; makes them not to get the optimum for the organization. So, the goal is overcoming those refraining forces. I do believe that behavior of people is headed for their own rational interest which is not always the best for the company. In adition, we are looking for rationality in behavior which is only part of the truth. Is not envy, jealousy, narrow-minded, stuborness and so on, part of human being behavior?. without them, we only have part of the great picture and so, remedies will not work properly. Apart from that, the book is well organized and explains clearly the models the author is working with and the methodology used. Premises are strong and goals interested which lead to good results (provided human being were not as they are).	2000-12-11

The rest come from &quot;Positioning&quot;. The concept of bottom-up is nice but I am not sure  if thats a new concept or a redefinition on tactic and strategy.  Obviously, either of tactic and strategy must work. Otherway, something is  wrong. The idea of bottom-up could be stated as a redefinition of tactic  (as the key competing concept) and strategy (as the modeling of the  organization to be able to run and follow the tactic). If so, the flow is  down-up. On the other hand, authors are too much focused on the mental  positiong concept. Tactics (or strategies if you prefer) could arise from  many other sources. I recommend reading &quot;the mind of strategist&quot;  as another way of looking for competing striking concepts. All in all, this  book is nice and easy to read and some ideas can be got from it. I  specially enjoy its saying as &quot;the road to a disaster is paved with  improvements&quot; or &quot;most of the guys in the exciting fire line  fall, while the others remain&quot; (by the way, where do you prefer to  be?).

On the other hand, its chapters about modeling performed on fortran, C or  pascal are outdated stuff since this software is outdated, but they are  useful are a hands-on lesson on how simulation works and must be performed.

So, main points covered are change process issues, pitfalls in the implementation process and ways to ensure the success from  a organizational point of view. So, little technical or programming stuff  is supplied apart from some generic structure of SAP. If that is what your  are looking for, this is a good book. Dont come here for  technical/programming stuff or even for an end-user manual.	2000-07-31

In my opinion, a new title is needed since at the end of reading it, you dont know how to make simulations. You get a handle on  some uses of simulation and some pitfall and mistakes but in the end, the  book is overly superficial.	2000-06-19

This book compliles its work plus all the developments of this technique since its issue in the fifties. The beauty of this work is that it gathers  all the pitfalls, successes and fails encountered by the &quot;MRP  crusades&quot;. It also contends about the realationship between MRP and  JIT and its possible combination.	2000-06-14

By using a hands-on approach, step by step, the author goes through the main issues in developing a project like this. By using plain english, the stuff is easy  to read and well organized. The level is attainable to all readers no  matter their previous level in the topic. The four stars classification  comes from the lack of some deeper study in some areas which is necessary  for kicking off facilities like this.	2000-06-14

The chapter addressing the mission is especially usefull as a thorough overview of the subject. The main drawbacks are the  overly superficial treatment of strategy and the way of working out figures  from strategy orientation (concepts are not easily turned into figures  without a great load of subjectivity). All in all, its a good introduction  to strategy.	2000-06-06

The selection can obviously be discussed but the beaty is to be able to get the main points from 50 milestones in management thinking. Moreover, some  books could be a discovering and prompt you to read them. The only weakness  is that some books are out of date (which doesnt mean old but overcome by  time) and I would have prefered 50 &quot;still alive&quot; books.	2000-06-01
