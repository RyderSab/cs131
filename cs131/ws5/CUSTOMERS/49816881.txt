Although it is well written and has an interesting premise, I had a hard time relating to the main charcters, who were all self-absorbed and none of whom respected the vows each other were supposedly bound to keep.	2005-05-16

The main character doesn't bank on the gnawing effects of guilt over a score of years.  When he finally acts with courage it is too late for some, but not too late to redeem his own soul. <br /> <br />This was an excellent book that will provoke lots of thoughtful discussion and remain with the reader for some time to come.	2005-05-16

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Well worth sticking with	I had a lot of difficulty getting into this book, because it was written in the present tense, which I find feel keeps the reader at arms-length.  Once I got past that, however, I found this to be an engrossing story that did not disappoint. The Canadian point of view regarding the Cold War was quite interesting, and I enjoyed challenging my memory of high school French to translate phrases, which for the most part could be figured out from the context of the sentence.	2005-05-01

I rated the book one star, not because of the talent that it took to produce it, but because the content is so shockingly painful to read.  It was like trying to watch someone perform surgery on themselves.  This is supposed to be funny??  Why?  I know animals who are treated with more care and love than the narrator of this memoir.   And I should be laughing over this....I think not.	2004-08-13

Then it's up to you to decide if you want to expand upon an item on your list and develop it into a journal entry or perhaps a poem, short story, reflective piece, etc.  Buy two: one for yourself and one for a friend.  Then you'll have someone that you can compare lists with.	2003-07-22

Several of the chapters had actually been published first as short stories - later the author built the rest of the novel around them, which may account for the criticism of inconsistent writing by one reviewer.  On the whole, I lkied this book very much and would recommend it as an insightful book that compels the reader to consider the impact good art has on our lives.	2002-07-22

I longed to know more about what motivated Jacob, but never got more than a one-dimensional look at him.  And his God...barely even gets a mention...rather surprsing given the source material the author was using.  Nevertheless, I found this an interesting read that certainly gave me a whole new perspective on the culture and mores of the women in the Bible.	2002-07-22

I know this because, as a Language Arts teacher, I have had to judge spelling bees for a lot of years.  So, naturally I was drawn to this book wondering how an author could launch a story from such an unpromising topic.  I was pleased and surprised by just how much I enjoyed this novel, peopled by such interesting and complex characters.  A rather heavy dose of Jewish mysticism bogged the story down from time to time, but mostly this was an intriguing read.  An added bonus is you get to pick up some rather obscure words to add to your spelling lexicon, just in case you are ever tempted to relive your youth and enter a spelling competition.	2001-06-10

While I reserve 5 stars for THE STAND and THE EYES OF THE DRAGON, this book comes pretty close.  The author's genius still lies in his ability to bring characters to life within just a few sentences, making even the most minor of characters someone interesting.	2001-06-10

I was very disappointed and frustrated by the end of this reading experience.  I think the author missed some opportunities to tie things together at the end of the book.  Why the abrupt shift of setting, for instance, after making the Congo the focus throughout the entire book?  Why wasn't the father's fate more clearly defined?  He is such a strong presence in the novel, yet me know so little about him. Most of all, I found the daughter's wordplay just plain annoying by the time I got to the end.	2001-06-10

Unfortunately I think she should have quit a couple of books ago.  TARA ROAD was marginal, but SCARLET FEATHER is just plain awful.  The plot line is so thin you can see through it.  The characters are shallow, uninteresting, and self-absorbed - with the exception of the sainted Muttie and Lizzie who are drawn as caricatures of working class Irish, to the point of being insulting.  The fast-action style of cutting from one character to another may work in the movies, but is oddly out of place in a novel of this sort.  Too bad Binchy didn't quit with THE GLASS LAKE - now there was a fine book!	2001-06-10

The litany goes on ad nauseum and becomes more and more forced and  contrived as the story rolls out.  <br />There is little to like about the  title charcter, Matilda, who shows none of the spunk that has endeared  readers to the feisty Birdy or Lucy in Cushman's previous books.  And the  jolly one-dimensional characters that surround Matilda do nothing to  illuminate how a female apprentice would have really been treated in the  Middle Ages.<br />Cushman has shown that she can write an engaging novel with  a central character who sticks in our mind long after we've read the last  chapter.  I hope her next effort shows a return to that winning formula.	2000-09-16
