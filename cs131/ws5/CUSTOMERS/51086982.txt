If you liked the puzzles in Pickover's \\"Alien IQ Test\\", you will like the puzzles in this book.<br /><br />The book is not all numbers. There are historical anecdotes and stories about mathematicians told by the author's alter-ego, Dr. Googol. Are all mathematicians insane? The answer is not clear. However, the author describes the five strangest. Did you know that Pythagoras believed that it was sinful to eat beans?<br /><br />There are a number of interesting top ten lists. As one who thinks that the proper role of mathematics is to solve the problems of the physical world, I was happy to note that Dr. Googol chose equations of physics for six of the ten most important mathematical expressions, e.g. Gauss' law and Newton's law of gravitation.

Ramanujan credited a goddess, Namagiri, for his inspiration.  Thus, part of this work deals with the life and legacy of Ramanujan.<br /><br />The passion may also refer to Pickover's infatuation with the riddles of mathematics. He deals with classic problems such as that of the Bridges of Konigsberg or the always popular secrets of magic squares.  Some of the mathematical investigations are a little further off the beaten track.  For example, what is the most forgettable license plate?  A friend of Pickover, a physicist, actually has a plate with the string of letters \\"syzygys.\\"  (See \\"customer image\\")  Is this impossible to remember?  Most people may say yes.  However, it is easy to recall if you are a solar eclipse devotee or a fan of the musical group of that name.  Pickover concludes that the string with the highest entropy (the most disorder) is the most forgettable, e.g., the binary string 11010010.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for those who would like to share the passion for mathematics of Ramujan and Pickover.	2005-07-11

His general theory of relativity which followed a few years later made him world famous.  However, his attempts at a unified field theory, a \\"theory of everything\\", have not been well regarded. The author revises our view of Einstein's work, pointing out that Einstein's field theory investigations were a precursor to modern-day string theory.  He also explores the effects predicted by Einstein that were not observed for another sixty or seventy years: the Bose-Einstein condensation in which a collection of atoms acts as one; gravitational lensing by distant galaxies to form Einstein rings; and gravity wave radiation.  However, Professor Kaku has missed one very important Einstein contribution.  Einstein pioneered the theory of stimulated emission of radiation in 1917.  This forms the theoretical foundation for lasers which were not demonstrated for another forty years.  Lasers are a pervasive technology, used for everything from supermarket bar code scanners and CD players to eye surgery.<br /><br />Can you write a book about a physicist and his work without including a single equation or diagram?  Apparently you can.  The author makes it work.  I also recommend his book \\"[[ASIN:0385477058 Hyperspace]]\\".	2004-08-17

I can quickly get an idea of the influence of my work through the citations in subsequent publications. However, even citations do not necessarily assure that a work has been read. In order to find the influence of Copernicus' famous book, the author has spent decades tracking down the six hundred surviving copies of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; in the libraries of the world.  He has used the marginal writings in these books to connect the books with their owners and groups of sixteenth century astronomers and mathematicians.  Yes, Copernicus' book was read and analyzed by scientists throughout the western world.<br />Gingerich's book may be of more interest to library scientists than to astronomers. However, I did find the chapter on the geocentric Ptolemaic system vs. the Copernican heliocentric system fascinating.  The author dispels the myth that the Ptolemaic system needed an unmanageable number of epicycles to match calculations with observations..  He shows that the two systems yielded equivalent predictions using about the same order of complexity. As a physicist, I would argue that you can work in any coordinate system that you choose, even one in which the Earth is stationary. However, the Copernican system did simplify the calculations and more importantly does more closely express the physical reality of the solar system. The work of Copernicus paved the way for Kepler's laws including the discovery of the elliptical nature of planetary orbits.  Both the geocentric and heliocentric models were based upon the theory that the orbits of celestial bodies were fundamentally circular. This was a good first approximation for matching the precision of the existing observations. It was another century and a half after Copernicus that Newton formulated a theoretical basis for explaining planetary mechanics.	2004-06-28

Actually, the first alphabet writings were carved in stone around 1800 BC. However, the alphabet has been evolving and changing ever since. It was not until the early 1800s that the letters j and v became official letters of our now 26-letter alphabet.  (They did not tell us about this in elementary school.) We could have just as well had a 22-letter or 30-letter alphabet.  About the same time that j and v were included, the thorn expressing the th sound, was lost.  I found when visiting Iceland that it is still used there. Other letters have been lost through history. Could we lose a few more? The author is absolutely correct about the relative unimportance of the h.  In my native Brooklyn, the h sound is rarely used, e.g. there can be pronounced dere.<br />I had wondered where the y came from. Now I know that the Romans imported it based on the Greek upsilon for use with words of Greek origin. The author missed mentioning my favorite y-word, syzygy, which has three of them.<br />There is some repetition in the book as well as an inconsistency. The language brought to England by the conquest of 1066 is referred to in different chapters as old French, medieval French, or Norman. I believe that the last is probably correct. There are still a few Norman speakers on the Channel Islands. On the island of Jersey they have Norman felines called cats in Norman as are ours, not French chats.	2004-03-01

I used to eagerly await the publication of Roger Edrinn's fourteeners calendar.  Unfortunately, 2002 was the last year for which he did one.  The void has since been filled by the CMC.  This calendar provides a standard representation of each month divided into a grid of five weeks with seven days per week. There is also a page for November/December 2003. Each month's page is placed below a mountain photograph page. The pages are twelve inches square.  Each day in the calendar grid has its own 1-1/2 by 1-7/8 inch box, leaving sufficient space for notes. Astronomical events and the usual federal and religious holidays are indicated.<br />This calendar has some impressive photographs.  The view of Ellingwood and Blanca seen from the Little Bear ridge conveys the feeling of the stark massiveness of the rock. The Wetterhorn haloed by a triple rainbow at sunset is quite unusual. However, I could not find an identification of the cover photo. (Todd Caudle has sent me a note saying that it is Snowmass Mountain.) I recommend this calendar for anyone who is a fourteener fanatic or who likes mountain photographs.	2003-12-15

For Yorktown residents it is a worthwhile acquisition, if only for the photographs of bygone eras. Horse-drawn vehicles were pervasive in the first quarter of the twentieth century.  Automobiles were few and far between. Photographs of Commerce Street in the 1920s are charming. The book serves as a reminder as to what we have lost, but also to what we still have to preserve.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Yorktown during the American Revolution and the Civil War, the creation of the Croton water supply system, the railroad which ran through town until 1962, famous Yorktown residents, and the communities that make up today's Yorktown.<br /><br />Yorktown is a rectangular political entity which was carved out of a map over 200 years ago.  It has no natural borders, just the straight lines superimposed on a less regular landscape.  It comprises many individual communities: Shrub Oak, Mohegan Lake, Jefferson Valley, Yorktown Heights, Croton Heights, Huntersville, and Teatown to name some of them.  Over the years, these communities have grown together to form one entity.  It is a tribute to the people of Yorktown and also to its dedicated public servants that the town has grown a sense of greater community.<br /><br />If the authors err, it is on being overly focused on the division of the town into neighborhoods and business hamlets.  In fact, the individual communities are not so well defined as they may once have been. Today, the lines are blurred, communities overlap.  We are more than a collection of hamlets and neighborhoods. What effects one part of Yorktown now effects the whole town.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0738555274 Yorktown (Postcard History: New York)]] April 11, 2009<br /><br />This is the third book by Arcadia Publishing concerning the past of the town of Yorktown. This latest book is well worth the purchase price. The previous two, the [[ASIN:0738504556 The Croton Dams and Aqueduct (Images of America: New York)]] and [[ASIN:0738512737 Yorktown (NY) (Images of America)]] are also well worth acquiring.<br /><br />This edition, the Postcard History, is less a history and more a snapshot in time. During the period of about 1910 to 1930 apparently there were postcards made of just about anything.  Clearly, photo postcards showing our cute train depot might be expected. But why would there be postcards made of seemingly ordinary roads, stores, and houses?  For whatever reason they were produced, we are fortunate to have these documents of Yorktown's past. We are less fortunate in some of the transformations that have taken place.<br /><br />Particulary amazing were the photos of sections of State Road and Whitney Avenue, now Commerce Street. The postcard images show Victorian houses, fenced yards, and unpaved roads. The landscape has changed so much in one hundred years that it is totally unrecognizable as the Commerce Street of today. Of the dozen or so victorian houses that can be seen in the photo on page 73, only one remains! It is now the real estate office on the corner of Commerce Street and Veterans Road. Somehow I think that we could have done better.  How have we managed to replace those beautiful homes with the strangest collection of chaotically styled and placed buildings in Northern Westhester?<br /><br />Some areas of town have done better over the course of the last century. East Main Street in Shrub Oak has retained many older structures,  probably because the center of development there shifted to nearby Route 6.  As the book notes, the major difference for East Main Street is that the road has been paved.<br /><br />I plan on taking the postcard book with me around Yorktown to see if I can identify the locations where the photos were taken.  There is one view of Underhill Avenue, a narrow unpaved path with a large rock on the side of the road.  John Tegeder, one of authors and our town planner, told me that the rock was still there.  I will have to go look for it.<br /><br />Note: For some reason, Amazon has coupled the pages for these two books so that you cannot review each separately.  Thus, the double review.f the road.

Most of these, like those at Stonehenge or Avebury, consist of large stones in rows or circles. However, many less impressive sites have yielded information about the lives of the people who lived during the stone age. For most of the book, the author documents the methods by which archeologists investigate potential sites using aerial photographs, decide where to dig, and the methods that they use for excavation. The care with which Pryor and his team unearth, examine, and preserve a pile of wood chips illustrates the seriousness of their scientific inquiries. However, I find that the author is inclined to attribute ceremonial uses to the structures that he examines. If we examine a set of prominent structures of New York City, e.g. the Brooklyn Bridge, Yankee Stadium, the United Nations buildings, the New York Stock Exchange, we find that they serve a variety of purposes. Perhaps neolithic works also served many purposes. For instance, the author dismisses astronomical interpretations of neolithic works in a few sentences. Although I recommend this book, I also recommend \\"Stonehenge Decoded\\" by Gerald Hawkins and \\"On Stonehenge\\" by Fred Hoyle for a different point of view.	2002-03-19

In the usual Pickover manner, the author does not let us rest with a light-hearted thesis on nuclear physics. He leads us to the conclusion that neither stars nor our universe could be without the fortuitous existence of an excited state of the carbon-12 nucleus. Is this because the excited state of carbon-12 was designed so or has our universe evolved from a cosmology of universes in such a way that the excited state is a necessity?

Several years ago, while I was on vacation in the Los Angeles area, I made an appointment to try out to be a contestant on the Wheel of Fortune TV show. I detailed the rules of the game to friends gathered around a pool in Altadena. Our host, a professor who never watched TV, said that puzzle solving on the Wheel was an example of cryptanalysis. He taught a course on the subject at Caltech. He retreated to the house and emerged with a copy of the Gaines book for me to read. I went on to win over $50,000 on the show.<br />This book may be dated now that we rely on computing systems to encrypt and decrypt our information.  However, I found the detailed discussions of historical encryption techniques interesting.

You may not become rich and famous in Hollywood as I did, but you should find this to be a worthwhile book.	2001-07-16

Today the Croton system contributes more than ten percent (typically 100 to 150 million gallons per day) to the water supply of 9 million people.  The quality of Croton water  is as good today as it was at the beginning of the twentieth century. It meets all federal health standards. Despite this, New York City intends to build a $1 billion filtration plant (to filter water that does not need to be filtered). The consequence  of the filtration plant scheme will be the abandonment of protection of the Croton Watershed. Many of today's watershed residents appreciate the reservoir system that lends so much to the beauty of the area, but also see New York City as a distant imperial power whose officials  often have little regard for the integrity of the watershed.<br />The conflict between Croton Watershed residents and New York City is not new. The book offers glimpses into life  one hundred years ago at the time of  the construction of the dam.  Homes, farmland and roads were flooded. Much of the Huntersville settlement was inundated. Some houses were moved uphill above the new water line.  Even the dead were disturbed. Tompkins reports that the Water Commissioners, the predecessors to today's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), contracted to have the remains moved. However, according to Tomkins, local lore has it that  &quot;only the stones were moved&quot;. That local lore persists.	2001-03-06

A century-long interval between transits makes the normal kind of solar eclipse seem like a frequent event. The transits occur in pairs separated by eight years, with over one hundred-year separations between the pairs. The last transit of Venus was in 1882. However, we can look forward to the transits of 2004 and 2012.<br />By traveling thousands of miles, I have been able to place myself in the path of the shadow for six total and two annular solar eclipses. With careful planning, and some last minute scurrying to avoid clouds, my success rate for viewing of the critical event is seven of eight.  How ironic that today I was able to walk into my own back yard to view a partial solar eclipse under a clear cloudless sky.<br />By contrast with total solar eclipses, which may be viewed only within a narrow corridor, a transit of Venus may be viewed from  any place on the Earth that faces the Sun during the event. Thus, simultaneous observations may be made from distant locations.<br />The author tells the story of the pursuit of transits of Venus by scientists whose aim was to establish a precision measurement of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. It is a great adventure story. There are the usual disasters: there are wars; ships are intercepted; natives run off with the instruments; and there are clouds. Finally, an unexpected optical effect, the &quot;black drop&quot;, appears. In the end science triumphs, although not as expected.<br />We no longer need to measure the transits of Venus to establish the astronomical unit. However, our ability to calculate and predict precise locations and times for the occurrence of such events as eclipses and transits is a confirmation of the success of our formulation of mechanics and an affirmation of the scientific method.<br />  This work is primarily a history with the basic information on the details of the transit of 2004 and very little on the transit of 2012.

It is still the best guide to the fourteeners.  Its major advantage lies in the classification of the routes  according  to required effort and technical difficulty. Once you have done  a few, you know just what  to expect on the next one. (I have completed 39  of  Roach's 55 fourteeners.)<br />In his previous edition, Roach discussed at  length the criteria for including a peak on the official list.  Much of  this discussion has been deleted.  However, the question remains. For  instance, why is North Maroon Peak on the generally accepted list of 54  fourteeners? It does not meet the criteria.  Why, when we look towards Mt.  Elbert, do we make believe that we do not see the prominent peak on the  left, Mt. Elbert-South?  Look again, next  time you are a few miles south  of Leadville.<br />Roach solves the problem by suggesting that the reader go  for all the peaks,  not just the official 54.  This and the inclusion  of  Challenger Point on a par with the other 54 is a not-so-subtle challenge to  the orthodox  point of view - if it is not on a t-shirt it does not  count.   Who knows, maybe someday by  popular demand, the Colorado Mountain  Club  will add a few more to the list of 54. In the meantime, I will write-in  Challenger  on my  fourteeners t-shirt.	2000-07-26

Connie Baxter Marlow has put together a tribute to Mount Katahdin and Baxter State Park. The people of Maine have a right to be proud of their mountain. This is not a trail guide to the mountain but rather a presentation of its flora and fauna.  The photography is very good.  However, the text tends to the mystical.  This is not a total surprise.  Mountains like Katahdin that stand by themselves tend to be regarded differently from those that are found in mountainous regions. For example, Mt. Shasta which looms over Northern California, just as Katahdin looms over the center of Maine, is the subject of legends about lost civilizations.  However, this book is worthwhile for its photographs.	2000-07-13

He gives route directions, trail descriptions, alternate routes, and a set of references for each state.<br />Some of the  references are to web sites. For instance, there are two good web sites  devoted to the highpoints: highpointers.org, and americasroof.com (neither  uses the www prefix). Holmes' book can be used to even greater advantage  when combined with the information available on the web. I am happy to  report that the people who control the access to Jerimoth Hill in Rhode  Island (the Wide-place-in-the-road State) have been convinced by the  Highpointers Club to put up their shotguns on four days of the year to  allow access to the highpoint.  I suppose that we should be grateful -  grateful that so many of the natural landmarks in the United States are  held open for the public by government ownership.<br />The book's subject has  presented me with some unanswered questions.  Why do many states celebrate  their highpoints with monuments while some others ignore them?  It cannot  be a regional issue.  Pennsylvania has surrounded theirs with a park while  nearby Maryland leaves it to a small but dedicated group of individuals  from West Virginia to mark a trail and maintain the highpoint.<br />Why  are so many of the highpoints near the boundaries of their states?  I  suppose that in the midwest where the land is flat and the slope is uphill  toward the continental divide, the highpoints can be expected to cluster on  the western edges of their states.  However, many of the eastern points lie  on state boundaries.  Perhaps the mountain ridges helped to define those  boundaries.<br />Finally, what attracts people to highpoints? Why is the  summit of Mt. Elbert so crowded while nearby Mt. Massive is relatively  ignored.  I did find local residents on Mt. Katahdin and also Wheeler Peak  who make annual trips to the summit of their highest peak.  Certainly, the  pursuit of highpoints does provide an excuse for traveling to new places.  I would never have gone to Kenton if it were not for Black Mesa.  It was  worth the trip.  I suppose that you cannot visit all fifty of the  highpoints without also visiting all fifty states.ertainly, the  pursuit of highpoints does provide an excuse for traveling to new places.

The previous review predicts a smart card revolution for the  year 2000.  Here it is. Y2K has come and gone.  Where are my smart cards?  The reality is that the most pervasive use of smart cards has come about by  government directive.  The King of France has decreed that you cannot use a  phone without having a smart card.  Much touted experiments for smart card  use in the United States have been failures.  These include smart card  electronic purses for the Atlanta Olympics and for Manhattan.

In a society where new technology plays an increasingly important role, the individual or  corporation may find that owning a few patents, or better yet a large  portfolio of patents, may be the key to success. This is independant of  whether the patent holder practices the technology of the patent.<br />The  authors discuss patents in the light of the e-commerce revolution.  They  suggest the use of patents in a strategic manner.  They provide  illustrations and examples of successful patent strategies. Although much  of what they say may be known to those who are in the race to establish  business method patent portfolios, even those who think that they know what  patents are all about can learn something from this book.	2000-06-16

Many of the trailheads for hiking to state summits are in obscure locations. Even those with drive-up routes can be difficult to find. This book is an excellent guide. However, approaches do change from time to time. There are now two web sites that provide updated information. Get the book, but also consult the web before you go.<br /><br />What is the most difficult state highpoint to reach? Is it Alaska's Mt. McKinley/Denali at 20.320 ft or Colorado's Mt. Elbert at 14,433 ft?  No, it is Rhode Island's Jeremoth Hill, 812 ft. While the governments and people of most states have marked their highpoints in some special way, Rhode Islanders have taken great pains to keep visitors out. The highpoint is surrounded by privately owned property decorated with No Trespassing - No Visitors signs. You would think that a state that is little more than a wide place in the road would do more to be friendly to tourists. Contrast this with Kansas where the private owners of Mt. Sunflower have built an outdoor sculpture garden and picnic area for their highpoint.<br /><br />P.S. Since this review was written, the Highpointers Club has arranged with the owners of Jeremoth Hill to allow access a few times a year.	2000-06-15
