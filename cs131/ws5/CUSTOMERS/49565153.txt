There is prolonged, mushy scene of reunion with relieved wife and children, with invariable tree-wheel plastic bike near the front door, little league trophies and assorted tchochkes on the shelves... This book seems like an imitation of all this - a bad action movie without at least visual gratification of big explosions, car chases and leggy babes in distress. <br />It's not only that. Apparently the author developed some alienation complex, taken to emigration in early age, after probably being called \\"zhid\\" a few times in Leningrad kindergarten, and - more often - \\"stinky Russian bear\\" in a Jewish school in New York. I am not very interested in what specific grudges and revenges he is acting out, but the results are not pretty.<br />The problems with this book are many. The author doesn't seem to know the subject he is writing about. He can't get \\"Russian Mafia\\" dialogues or anything Russian (or Eastern European) at all - not even \\"Stalinist\\" babushkas protesting on the streets. Take an underpaid temp screenwriter scribbling third-rate movie with 67-th iteration on \\"Russian gangsters with nukes\\" theme, with \\"nyet\\" and \\"vodka\\" exhaustively covering his linguistic knowledge. He could do better job simulating \\"Russian mob\\" lingo that Shteyngart. Nor can author describe New York parties of Ivy League-ish graduate students. May be at least he gets what he knows better - a \\"Midwestern liberal college\\" (author graduated from Oberlin) and a crummy immigrant-assistance agency, where he worked himself.<br />The book title and cover picture suggests at least some entertaining, gratuitous sexual debauchery. Neither name, nor picture, however, has any connection with the plot. Expecting reader will be disappointed, at maximum treated with this: \\"... biznismenski lunches, with postprandial discharge of weapons, deflowered Kazino girls going down on Hog, to the tune of ABBA's `Take a chance on me'\\". That's probably the sexual high of this book - a literary equivalent of a titillating 2-second shot of the \\"dark side\\" in a bad action flick. The rest of what can pass for erotic theme appears simply... Midwestern - flat and boring as a cornfield.<br />It is not clear if the author allows even a theoretical possibility that any Russian can be anything other than mobster or prostitute. Certainly there aren't any even briefly mentioned in the book. Oh, wait, there is also a demented WWII veteran, so full of ingrained racism (all Russians are, of course) that he can't even abstain from attacking some Egyptian during citizenship pledge ceremony. I feel like living on some other planet than Mr. Shteyngart, which curiously has an assortment of the same geographical names, such as Russia, New York and others. I certainly know many hundreds of successful people - Russians, Jews, Ukrainians, etc., both in Russia and abroad, of any possible occupation except the two above mentioned. <br />To be fair, not only Russians are profusely touched by the author's venom. Almost anything Eastern European is covered with condescending sneer. Mr. Shteyngart can't pass a single \\"Stolovan\\" babushka without spiteful snickering about their \\"canine faces, wisps of chin hair\\", the only thing they can produce - a big dirty spit on our hero's shiny BMW. Readers must feel like reaching for bug spray to get rid the world of such useless vermin. The rest of Europe is proudly represented by a deviant, murderous (not to mention idiotic and physically repugnant) member of \\"Catalan mafia\\". One can only wonder about author's motives: that looking across the ocean all these locales seem too close to Russia, or is it a strange appeasement of upright Midwestern notions of morally suspect Europe, or may be the whole book is a globe-trotting revenge trip wherever a Jew can feel historical grudges (what's next on his list - descendants of ancient Romans, Babylonians?).<br />Oh, and the pyramid scheme of Vladimir Girshkin, book protagonist. In real life, Prague indeed was a scene of some spectacular Ponzi schemes - without having anything to do with \\"Russian mafya\\". The biggest of them occurred in mid-90 and organized by a Czech repatriate from USA, Harvard graduate Victor \\"Pirate of Prague\\" Kozeny. It involved elaborate fraud with privatization shares, estimated up to one billon dollars. Initially the story hardly made any headlines in western media, while those defrauded were mostly ordinary Czechs. Who gives a damn - they were supposed to be funny little tourist attractions, for a few dollars ready to happily sing their tribal ditties and praises to newly discovered wonders of Big Macs and stock certificates. Anything diverging from this picture was less likely to appear in the news. Later Kozeny got a lot of attention (such as cover story in Fortune Magazine) when among the dupes in his next, even bigger adventures (involving privatization of Azerbaijani oil company), were former senator George Mitchell and a few other luminaries, who were supposed to provide a political muscle in Kozeny's fund dealings with local government. The story ended in... remember O. Henry \\"Babes in The Jungle\\"? There is always a bigger fish... or bigger crooks.<br />This book itself represents a Ponzi scheme of a sort. It has a promise in the beginning, fresh and witty at times, but quickly loses traction. Jokes and dialogues become flatter and sillier, the plot - completely preposterous. Soon the only thing that kept me reading was sheer curiosity how bad will it get. Well, that was easy: by the end the book resembles content of a vacuum cleaner bag after extensive use in a long-neglected room: every stale crumb, every long-discarded cliché is found, processed and packed in a tight volume. If idea of gazing at the innards of their vacuum cleaner sounds like fun to some, one can safely assume that this book will find its reader after all.	2002-07-08
US	49565153	R3L9GHEUA988WZ	0743203151	102665762	Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft	Books	4	26	35	N	N	Trapped in "Innovator's dilemma"	In the second half of the 90's Microsoft got caught in the now classical \\"Innovator's Dilemma\\", described by Clayton Christiansen in his book of the same name. The essence of it is that highly successful companies often become victims of their own legacy - not because of bad management or even obsolete technology, but because the inertia of their successful product improvements creates appearance that they are still on top of the game, better than any competition. But now these improvements do not matter any more, because new, emerging technological challengers do not strive to beat the entrenched leader on the same field, but instead compete with them on different criteria, which become more and more important to consumers while being cheaper and simpler than the established product, and eventually overcome the latter.<br />For the Microsoft the dilemma was the following: Windows was a gigantic cash cow for the company, its most profitable product, together with MSOffice firmly tied to the Windows platform. But the sudden explosion of the Internet, World Wide Web, and emerging Java technology by 1995 threatened to sweep away existing status quo, and totally reshape the landscape of computer industry, threatening Microsoft dominance in desktop computing. Should Microsoft stick defensively with Windows or should it reinvent itself around Internet and promising new technologies?<br />The author describes the intense internal debates and doubts within Microsoft campus about this very real and credible challenge of the Internet, that occurred in 1995-97. <br />Microsoft finally decided to stick with creaky old Windows. The author decries this course of events - arguing that the company squandered its chance for renewal. Yet, at least on the on the surface, it was a sound decision. Threat of the Internet largely passed, Microsoft is still dominant and profitable as never before. Was it right to stick with the old? Perhaps yes, from its monopoly position. It is (probablytemporary) advantage to the Microsoft, but this ossification of  monopolistic power is inevitably a huge loss to the whole computer industry and even science.<br />Supporters of  Microsoft often claim it as an example of relentless innovation and technical brilliance. This is hardly credible in recent years. The rate of innovation in Microsoft products themselves was absolutely dismal in the last decade. Consider just one example. In the five years of intense competition from 1981 to 1986, before the Microsoft dominance, enormous strides were made in the user interface - one the most important aspect of personal computer technology. It evolved from primitive, barely legible screens of a dozen lines of greenish letters, where user had to precisely type some obscure, hard-to-remember commands, to the very usable system of windows and icons (first commercially implemented in Apple's Macintosh) which everybody could still recognize and use today. Compare this to the five-year period from 1995 to 2000. The operating system progressed from Windows 95 (not very innovative in itself) to ... (yawn) some barely distinguishable to an ordinary user messy bunch of obscure acronyms (Windows 98, 2000, ME, XP, whatever), united perhaps by a common feature that they are usually not worth many hours spend to install or upgrade them, until Microsoft policy on compatibility makes it absolutely necessary.<br />In fact every significant innovation in computers in recent years was in the areas outside the Microsoft monopoly power. Its domination most likely stifled progress not only inside the company, but almost everywhere in the computer industry. Contrary to widespread boosterism associated with go-go years of Internet boom, the decade of 90's was NOT a time of revolutionary developments in computer science. Research associated with new operation systems stagnated - a direct consequence of the Microsoft overwhelming dominance. No breakthrough comparable in importance, for example, to the Object-Oriented Programming in early 80's, occurred in software engineering. There was a lot of noisy activity but in fact only incremental progress in such areas as parallel computing, storage, databases. Computer graphics mainly followed developments invented earlier, in 70's and 80's (polygon graphics with increasingly sophisticated shadings, ray-tracing), only with vastly increasing hardware power.<br />Most of the compression algorithms (LZW, JPEG, MPEG, wavelets etc.) were also developed during previous two decades. So are all basic principles of modern cryptography and security. In this area the 90's were the years of commercialization and incremental, often glacial, improvements. In terms of new ideas this decade was not even remotely comparable to the fundamental revolutionary advances made in 70's. The only significant developments were in those areas outside of the Microsoft dominance - mostly in the Internet area (such as caching, distributed processing and storage), or the invention of the \\"virtual machine\\" used in Java technology.<br />Instead of being dynamic innovators, boldly leading computer industry towards the new horizons, thousands of Microsoft clever programmers long ago became an oppressive praetorian guard defending the palace of the current ruler. <br />Often cited as a sign of Microsoft technical prowess is the sheer volume of code contained in the Windows or Office programs (reaching some 30 million lines of code or more). This is preposterous. Millions of lines of code built in Windows are no more signs of innovativeness and vitality than ever increasing millions of tons of steel production were the evidence of economic strength of the later-era Soviet Union. True innovation is not proportional to the volume of code crammed into a package of software.<br />Christiansen's \\"Innovator Dilemma\\" and the ways to overcome it was conceptualized with application to companies which have comfortably leading position in their fields, but not all-encompassing monopolies, who can squash emerging competitors at the early stage. Microsoft is clearly (and legally) a monopoly - one of the most powerful in history. It is possible that one day it will be driven by pure market and business forces to reinvent itself and become again an innovative, entrepreneurial company. But for now, and in the immediate future, it continues to buck and stifle innovations in computing.	2002-06-30
US	49565153	R6Q7R0N2FCMBY	0913966568	381276185	The Evolution of Civilizations	Books	5	89	97	N	N	Driving forces of society�s development	This is a striking book. When one is past the formative years, it rarely happens that a single book can substantially change one's view of the world. For me the \\"Evolution of Civilizations\\" influenced my understanding of history more than anything I've read in many years.<br />The most important author's contribution to historical analysis is identification of the growth mechanism - \\"instrument of expansion\\", which can be quite different in different civilizations. It must include two necessary conditions - generation of surplus output, and its investment in productive economic activities. Later, this \\"instrument of expansion\\" becomes institutionalized, when surplus is spent on maintenance of status quo of ruling elites and various vested interests, and a society enters \\"Age of Conflict\\".   <br />One of the distinctions, which Quigley attributes uniquely to the Western civilization, is that it passed through the \\"Age of Expansion\\" and reached the \\"Age of Conflict\\" three times in its history. First - during Middle Ages (he specifically puts dates 970-1270) with the feudalism as an instrument of expansion, which became institutionalized as chivalry and municipal mercantilism. The second period is the Renaissance era (1440-1630), with the commercial capitalism as instrument of expansion, which ended in the \\"Age of conflict\\" of the brutal Thirty Years War, absolutism, and state mercantilism of the emerging nation-states. The third \\"Age of Expansion\\" is associated with the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the second half of the 18-th century. It had the industrial capitalism as an instrument of expansion, which became institutionalized in the monopolistic capitalism and imperialism.<br />Quigley puts the end of the third \\"Age of Expansion\\" specifically in 1929, with the Wall Street crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. This is an americentric view; in fact the process of institutionalization and monopolistic excesses can be traced to late 19-th century, andby early 20-th century they were plainly evident. Western economies still expanded, but financial crashes, increasing in frequency and magnitude, underlined new fragility due to the exhaustion of the expansionary mechanism. In this sense the WWI was a typical \\"Age of Conflict\\" war, similar to the Hundred Years War and the Thirty Years War of the previous \\"Ages of Conflict\\" in Europe - not a clash of civilizations, or the conflict between the old and the new. Instead it was pointless, horrible slaughter underlying the conflict between vested interests of various elites and countries belonging to one civilization, and largely devoid of irreconcilable ideological differences.<br />Yet, contrary to the author, it is unlikely that the Western civilization is unique in this sense.  The ascendance of every civilization includes several distinct stages. In fact it is more historically consistent to talk about the probability of the civilization's survival after a period of crisis, brought by institutionalization of the \\"instrument of expansion\\" and solidifying status quo. One can argue, for example, that the Islamic civilization experienced at least two distinct \\"ages of expansion\\" - the first centered at times of Abbasid Caliphate, the second - during the ascent of the Ottoman Empire, in 14-16th centuries.<br />In the case of Orthodox Christian (i.e. Russian) civilization Quigley puts the \\"Age of Expansion\\" in the interval 1500-1900, and then - a new one beginning with the Soviet era. In fact, just like Western civilization, the Orthodox one experienced three very distinct stages of expansion before 20th century. The first one was Kievan Rus, which flourished along the North-South trading routes between the Baltic and Black seas (hence the duality of the most important cities - Kiev in the south and Novgorod in the north), which entered the \\"Age of Conflict\\" near the end of 12-th century and was conquered by Mongol invasion. The next period of expansion probably began around 1350 (its first show of strength was the victory over Mongols in Kulikovo Pole in 1380) and was centered around Moscow. It lasted probably until institutionalization of the part of the boyar elites loyal to Ivan IV (Grozny), around 1560. Its instrument of expansion was oriental-style autocracy, based on the ideas of civil and military administration borrowed from China, Golden Horde and Islamic countries. The subsequent \\"Age of Conflict\\" included terrible repressions of later-stage Grozny period, \\"Time of Troubles\\" in early 17-th century, and early period of the Romanov dynasty. The next stage began with Peter the Great, and was associated with St. Petersburg period. Its instrument of expansion was European-style absolutism, with westernizing aristocratic elite and bonded peasantry. It reached its zenith around 1815 with the victory over Napoleon, and began to stagnate around 1830.<br />I would argue that Quiglean interpretation of the subsequent period included unsuccessful attempt at the new instrument of expansion (western-borrowed industrial capitalism) in late the 19-th and early 20-th century, which was aborted and instead a new civilization was born. This socialist (or atheistic) civilization rapidly expanded to about the third of the globe and exerted strong influence on the western world. Its \\"instrument of expansion\\" included Communist party as an organization responsible for investing economic surplus (which later became institutionalized in \\"nomenclatura\\") and social engineering, which allowed rapid industrialization and development of education and health care. It reached its zenith in victory over Hitler, launch of the Sputnik and Gagarin's flight. This civilization entered its first \\"Age of Conflict\\" around 1965, apparent in progressing economic stagnation, intra-civilizational tensions with China (including a small war in 1969), one of the first manifestations of its crisis was defeat in the Moon landing race. Soviet regime collapsed around 1990,but the civilization did not, which is evident in strong economic performance in China throughout 90-s (which can be viewed as Quiglean \\"geographic circumvention\\") and the fact that Russia, despite some religious revival, remained overwhelmingly secular and didn't revert to many previous monarchic and religious traditions. After a period of painful reforms it will have the potential for the new \\"Age of Expansion\\", probably based on some western and some of its own ideas.	2001-11-19
US	49565153	R38518V4FQF4K7	1586480448	447389178	Chienne de Guerre: A Woman Reporter Behind the Lines of the War in Chechnya	Books	3	11	17	N	N	chienne de la propagande de guerre	In the spring of 1999 the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia over Kosovo changed the global political landscape in some unintended ways. The world most powerful military alliance went to war, throwing all its might, as an ally of a fairly ordinary guerilla insurgency, not much different from dozens of other separatist movements in various parts of the globe. This was not, of course, the first time a tinpot rebel group was used in a power play in bigger political games. The unusual part was little evidence of any truly strategic interests in that adventure, as opposed to purely opportunistic reasons, such as to demonstrate NATO usefulness in the eve of its 50-th anniversary celebration in April 99, or for Clinton to exorcize ghosts of his humiliation after impeachment over Monica affair. This immediately gave boost to various militant separatists all over the world. In May 99 Pakistan-supported Kashmere rebels launched their biggest offensive in decades against India in Carghil region; East Timor went in flames that summer, with large loss of life and hundreds thousands people uprooted from their homes; from Sri Lanka to Columbia all kinds of militants increased their activity. Ironically, Turkey, itself a participant of NATO operation in Kosovo allegedly to protect ethnic minority, in the spring of 1999 carried the most intensive attacks in years against Kurdish guerillas, with frequent incursions into northern Iraq, where Kurds were supposedly protected from Saddam army by international forces. Another place, where the war in Kosovo coincided with upsurge of violence and separatism, was Chechnya. After Russian withdrawal in September 1996, Chechnya, while relieved of large-scale fighting, quickly descended into lawlessness, hotbed of the most radical Islamic extremism and bloody turf war between local warlords. It largely disappeared from western media radars, except for occasional reports of yet another gruesome murder of some missionary or aid workers (of which thekillings of six Red Cross employees and kidnapping and beheading of four British telecommunication engineers are the most known examples). Early 1999 saw rapid increase in incursions of bands from Chechnya into neighboring regions, mainly Daghestan and Stavropol. Some of it was just petty crime, such as stealing of a few cows from surrounding villages by Chechen peasants whose economy collapsed since independence. But others were much more aggressive raids to stoke further separatism and inflame the war in the neighboring Muslim communities of other ethnic groups. Finally, in August 1999 Chechen warlords launched a full-scale invasion of several thousand rebels into mountainous areas of Daghestan, which precipitated Russian response and the second Chechen war. Since 1996 Chechnya wasn't a good place for journalists. During the 1994-96 war Chechen rebel government understood very well the role of propaganda and media coverage, and spend a great deal of efforts on courting both Russian and western reporters. After the war, as near-anarchy set in, journalists became expendable. Many of them that ventured there after the August 96 were kidnapped for ransom, including those that provided very sympathetic coverage to separatist cause during the war. For example, Elena Masyuk of Russian NTV channel, who invariably painted a romantic picture of warriors for independence during her 1994-96 war coverage, was herself kidnapped with her crew members in 1997 and held in horrible conditions by thugs who only laughed when she reminded how she supported their side during the war. Dozens of other journalists from Russia and western countries went through similar ordeal, several were murdered. Now, in the late 1999, as Russian troops moved quickly to repel two invasions into Daghestan and started bombing militant camps in Chechnya itself, situation changed again  with rebel forces suddenly in need of a few good propagandists. Or, at least, willing ones, as they foundin A. Nivat. She arrived first in September 1999 into Daghestan in the areas of recent fighting, with explicitly stated purpose to refute the Russian government version of events. When she didnt find much to support her refutation, in particular that the invasion had very little popular support among local ethnic groups that Chechen bands claimed to liberate from Russian oppression, and that citizens there overwhelmingly favored strong military actions against rebel forces, A. Nivat simply dropped the subject completely, almost in mid-sentence. As Russian troops moved against militant strongholds in Chechnya itself, she entered Chechnya incognito, without official approval. This was courageous move, of course, which she should be given credit for, although she was probably in less danger than most other journalists before her in the previous few years, when kidnapping and even murder was a likely outcome. She was constantly protected by rebel soldiers and operatives. She avoided being in the middle of bombing or fighting, although was close enough to hear the explosions, or encounter wounded guerilla soldiers streaming from areas of recent fighting. There is no question that many civilians are suffering in this war, but still the author presents too one-sided view of the events. When she tries simply to describe facts, without ideological preconditions, they form somewhat different picture. For example, she often mentions the infamous cleansing operations in Chechen villages by Russian troops, invariably cited for terrible abuses. But the only time  mentioned almost as a slip of a tongue  when she actually came in contact with Russian special forces during one such cleansing, it didnt look anything like pillage and destruction. Russian soldiers were polite, didnt hurt anybody and their only looting was taking several videocassettes (leaving receipts for them) to check for the presence of rebel propaganda or evidenceof their attacks, training or torture of prisoners. So much for indiscriminate brutality  the staple of reporting about such operations in the western media. This is the first book about the second Chechen war, and some weaknesses can be excused. Still, it all too often leaves out any inconvenient facts and does not have a minimum degree of objectivity and impartiality to be sufficiently credible.	2001-08-27

The first is the philosophical foundation of the \\"theory of reflexivity\\", with application to financial markets and historical process in general, resulting in the &quot;Open Society&quot; concept. The second is the assessment of the present moment of history and the author's vision of the future of the global financial and political architecture.<br />The \\"reflexivity theory\\", already developed by George Soros in his earlier books (e.g. \\"The Alchemy of Finance\\") can be summed up in his own words: \\"We are part of the world we seek to understand, and our imperfect understanding plays an important role in shaping the events in which we participate.\\" This entails recognition of the fundamental limitations of the social science and our own understanding of society. \\"It (reflexivity) creates a cleavage between the natural and social sciences and it undermines the postulate on which economic theory has been based: rational behavior in general and rational expectations in particular.\\"<br />This is a powerful statement indeed. It immediately follows that the future of humankind is not only unknown, or too difficult to predict, but unknowable, because self-awareness and attempts at prediction influence events and change the course of history.    This line of reasoning has more immediate application in the financial markets. The widely accepted \\"efficient market theory\\" postulates that market participants absorb all available information in an objective and efficient manner, and new information is random and unpredictable relative to previous expectations. If any statistically significant pattern appears in the market data, it should be exploited by many players and will soon disappear. This seems to be similar to the conclusions of the \\"reflexivity theory\\". At the first glance the \\"reflexivity\\" process can improve market \\"efficiency\\" in line with the arguments of the \\"market fundamentalists\\" arguments that market processes automatically self-correct any mispricing. Yet this is not what typically happens according to Soros (and his experience and investment track record suggests that his arguments should be taken very seriously). Instead of self-correcting towards the equilibrium, which characterizes many physical phenomena (such as, for example, most types of wave motion), markets form self-reinforcing tendency which moves further away from the equilibrium. This tendency, eventually turning out wrong (\\"fertile fallacy\\", and \\"radical fallibility\\" in Soros's terms) is supported by several positive-feedback mechanisms. <br />G. Soros believes that development of the \\"reflexivity\\" and \\"fallibility\\" concepts should have as profound effect on the thinking of society and historical process, as the Enlightenment and ideas born with French and American revolutions. \\"It is high time to subject reason, as construed by Enlightenment, to the same kind of critical examination that the Enlightenment inflicted on the dominant external authorities, both divine and temporal. We have now lived in the age of reason for the past two hundred years - long enough to discover that reason has its limitations. We are ready to enter the age Fallibility. The results may be equally exhilarating and, having learned from past experience, we may be able to avoid some of the excesses characteristic of the dawning of a new age.\\"<br />The remainder of the book deals mainly with the application of these ideas to the current moment in history and the author's vision for the global financial and political structure. This is not an easy task, and the author soon begins to fail his own recipe and the paradigm underlying this vision. To his credit, he never fails to recognize his own fallibility. He speaks at length, and very frankly, about his own investment mistakes and failed predictions. This provides a refreshing contrast with many others who prefer to ignore their failures, or, when they are too evident, spend many pages trying tojustify or attribute them to some extraneous factors.<br />He begins to miss his beat when speaking about the global financial and political architecture. After presenting sharp, well-argued criticism of the present state of the world, his recipes for improvement look disappointingly weak. Essentially it's all about \\"kinder, gentler\\" IMF, WB, NATO and other such institutions. His definition of the \\"Open Society\\"(that is, the one based on ideas similar to \\"reflexivity\\" and \\"fallibility\\") eventually looks like nothing more than touched-up version of any liberal democracy today. It is contrasted with \\"closed societies\\", based on authoritarian or nationalistic ideas. Well, throughout the human history the strongest military and economic powers always viewed themselves if not perfect, as the only models truly capable of improvement and progress. Every colonial conquest, no matter how destructive and brutal, was based on the ideological support of \\"bringing civilization to the barbarians\\" in one or another form. The \\"Open Society Alliance\\" proposed by Soros, doesn't look too different from yet another reincarnation of such ideological foundation.<br />In the model of financial bubbles, which the author described as an application of the \\"reflexivity theory\\", the unsustainable booms happen not because skeptical views during the bubble build-up are suppressed by some official censorship, but because even in the presence of critical dissent, the prevailing erroneous consensus become self-reinforcing and self-perpetuating. Similarly, the is no reason to believe that, just because of the democratic mechanisms and press freedom, the supposed \\"Open Society Alliance\\" will be free from the standard \\"arrogance of power\\". Such arrogance and delusion, which often leads to very costly political mistakes, wars or major crises, can happen not just because any other views are suppressed by censorship as in many authoritarian societies. Rather, because of artificial self-perpetuating consensus generated by and propagated through the media and political elite, while maintaining illusion of a genuine vigorous debate by endlessly pouring attention to peripheral issues.<br />The \\"fallibility\\" concept truly deserves serious intellectual attention. Too bad that most likely the \\"center\\" of the global system - the richest and most powerful nations - will invariable find it harder to apply these criteria to themselves, as opposed to the rest of the world.	2001-07-30
US	49565153	R1UM7EPO8BKVBF	0684857359	177040953	In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made	Books	4	7	11	N	N	Peering into the Plague aftermath: still misty	The author does not attempt to present a detailed history of the pandemic emergence and spread throughout the Europe. Rather, he offers a picture of life and social structure and its change in England and to lesser extent the continental Europe throughout the 14th century - sometimes sketchy, sometimes with fine details.<br />The advent of the plague was not completely unexpected. The economy in many European countries was already in decline since early 14-th century, in part with the beginning of a cooling period which brought harsh winters and short summers. In 1316, as mentioned by the author, there was a huge volcanic eruption in Indonesia which (as happened several times in history) created a \\"nuclear winter\\"-like dust layer in the upper atmosphere to block most of the sunlight, with the resulting crop failures and hunger. Famines and wars made the weakened population susceptible to the rapid spread of the epidemic.<br />Devastating as it was, the long-term consequences of the Plague are far from clear. Although N. Cantor occasionally tries, the narrative actually fails to find truly momentous changes brought about by the Plague. The most remarkable thing, in fact, was how little the geopolitical situation in Europe shifted in the wake of the pandemic. France continued to be the economically strongest power - before and after the Plague, although all states were proportionally weakened but it. France was even able to split the Papal power and establish a separate papacy at Avignon, which to a larger extent was served its separate interests, rather than bigger but fractious entity called The Holy Roman Empire. Yet it was England that was stronger in the military sense due to its use of newer techniques such as longbows, wielded by well-trained middle-class peasantry. They held advantage over the traditional feudal army of horse-mounted chivalry. It achieved a string of important victories over France during the Hundred Years War, until driven away from much of French territory by the popular army under the legendary Joan of Arc. Nevertheless, long-term quantitative consequences of the pandemic should not be underestimated. As mentioned by the author, the population of England had not reach the pre-plague levels of about six millions until mid-18th century - half a millennium later!<br />Could the course of history be significantly different if Princess Joan had not died in Bordeaux en route to marry the prince of Castile with possibility of England-Spanish alliance? This episode received a detailed description in N. Cantor book, with implicit allusion to large-scale strategic changes. Still, it is doubtful. England was already dominant military, the union with Castile wouldn't change this significantly, probably only stimulating France to seek its own new alliances. Spain, on the other hand, was more preoccupied internally - with its own unification and fighting Moorish states in the south, eventually driving them out completely in 1492.<br />The author makes some attempts to connect The Plague with the emergence of Renaissance a century later.  The connection appears pretty thin. For example, an eminent historian Carroll Quigley, the author of the &quot;Evolution of Civilizations&quot; puts the period of temporary but severe decline of the western civilization after three centuries of expansion to the years between 1270 and 1440. The Plague is right in the middle of this interval and has probably only the strongest quantitative feature of this decline. The devastating Hundred Years War (in fact an almost 150-year war) was already in full bloom. Renaissance also emerged in countries other than France and England which are central to this narrative, though also severely affected by the plague: Italian states (arts) and German states (crafts, such as Gutenberg printing press).<br />One of the important political events was the widespread Jewish pogroms and the expulsion from many cities. But was the Plague unique in that? Not really. Persecution of Jews occurred in waves throughout many centuries before and after the events of 1348-51, from Crusaders to the Holocaust of the 20-th century. Even before the Plague, Jews were largely expelled from England in early 14th century. At the end of the 15th century after they were expelled from Spain. The Plague was just one of the episodes of this tragic history.<br />It is interesting to compare this book with David Keys's &quot;Catastrophe: Quest for the Origins of the Modern World\\", central piece of which is the description of a global biomedical disasters possibly brought by volcanic eruption in Indonesia in 535 AD. In that case the implications were great, as argued by Keys fairly convincingly - from the final destruction of the western part of the Roman Empire and emergence of Islamic civilization to the decline of Celtic and the rise of Saxon culture in England.<br />Norman Cantor argues that high mortality and population decline during and after the Plague years led to very intensive court battles over the inheritance and land ownership, bringing a highly developed land code which to a large extent remained to this day. He claims that a barrister practicing land litigation in the second half of the 14th century would need only a refresher course to be fully capable real estate lawyer today in US or UK. This is somewhat of a stretch. No matter how sophisticated the land legislation and practices were developed in 14th century England, it mostly lacked very important contemporary financial instruments associated with it, from mortgage to leasing and insurance. And the modern concept of private, municipal and government property is significantly different from manorial, abbatial and royal land ownership of that time.<br />Overall, this is a worthy book, but I have a feeling that the full story of the Plague and its long-term consequences is yet to be written.	2001-06-25

Few people have more credentials to speak about progress and challenges in human-computer interaction than M. Dertouzos - the head of the Laboratory of Computer Sciences at MIT, which has a distinguished record of cutting-edge research in this and other fields. And yet many arguments and predictions in the book remain somewhat unconvincing.<br />&quot;Why computers aren't as easy to use as cars?&quot; - asks the author, like many other people before him, frustrated by their perpetual complexity and cumbersomeness. But comparison with cars is misleading. Cars are not designed to allow motorists to put under the hood any additional gadgets they fancy, or to perform arbitrary maneuvers, pushing every button and handle simultaneously. Yet the development of PC industry was based on accommodating ever more and newer gadgets under its cover, and on allowing almost any user's action, short of whacking a motherboard with a sledgehammer.   Of course, many flaws of computer systems are due to the industry's geeky origins and traditions, or specific biases of programmers and early users. But the roadmap described by the author is not the first serious attempt at radical improvement, and the goal it is hardly closer today than a few years ago. Why? <br />This probably has a lot to do with the economics of the computer industry, rather than other, more subjective, factors. As much as both hardware and software companies try to convince us how hard are they working to improve usability of their products, to eliminate bugs and crashes, the dirty secret of the industry is that it is not a top priority. Quality simply does not pay. In the &quot;physical&quot; world we often buy new things just to replace broken, or worn-out ones, not necessarily because the older items are hopelessly obsolete. Manufacturers have time and resources to gradually work out the kinks and improve design almost to perfection. With computers, on the other hand, &quot;physical&quot; amortization is low, so the only way to sell new systems is to cram them with more new features, no matter how poorly designed at first, and to make existing ones (no matter how proven and reliable) obsolete and incompatible. Simply reducing the number of bugs will not generate many sales. As a new feature appears, buggy and frustrating to use at first, the economic machine of the computer industry kicks into high gear. Magazines write raving reviews to increase their own sales, add-on manufacturers rush to incorporate it and propagate it down the sales channels, application developers write new drivers and other utilities which make new feature indispensable and previous versions obsolete. <br />As a result, today complex software is not unlike a human genome - a product of often messy and chaotic evolution, rather than a compact and elegant design. Pieces of active, useful code (&quot;genes&quot;) are surrounded by &quot;junk&quot;, leftover from previous generations of development, often redundant and useless. Why it is there? Because it is easier and cheaper to throw more hardware to crunch ever-bloating volumes of code and not to touch old rusting scrap, than to design and debug fast, efficient code. And it is not getting any better.<br />On the other hand, despite all these intrinsic problems and flaws, many complaints against computers are quite unreasonable. For example, the story often goes, it is difficult to find that text file created two months ago, or where are those digital pictures from the last trip. But this supposedly unfavorable comparison with the &quot;real world&quot; does not hold. Consider, for example, the tree-like directory/subdirectory/file hierarchy, used in most operating systems. In fact it closely resembles a real-world storage system - file cabinet/shelf/file/document, only better. Why are we complaining? Because we have much higher expectations of computerized data storage, than of a traditional file cabinet. A file cabinet requires careful maintenance; ifwe treat it the same casual way we do computer files, it would be totally unusable in two weeks. Complaints against computers notwithstanding, it is far easier to find past notes and other files on a computer than in a &quot;physical&quot; world.<br />The same with the gripes against Internet search engines, repeated in the book - a familiar story about a list of 10.000 irrelevant links in response to a search query. I think it is just a trite cliché. Frankly, it never failed for me to quickly find stuff even without following &quot;exact&quot; grammar rules recommended by engines. Besides, there is a good chance to discover surprises, interesting and useful information among those &quot;10.000 links&quot;. Of course, one could have a negative experience with web searches. In the &quot;real world&quot; a stupid or badly posed question is unlikely to produce a useful answer. Why do we expect a different result from a search engine? Moreover, search engines in the last few years was among the most competitive and dynamic technologies, where leaders changed almost every year - Yahoo, Altavista, HotBot, Northern Light, Google, each progressively offering better, faster, more complete results.<br />The author touts XML and &quot;semantic web&quot; technologies as one of the &quot;saviors&quot; to untangle the computer industry mess. Again, I have serious doubts about this proposed magic bullet. The beauty of the first versions of HTML, when it appeared in early 90's, was its simplicity and universality. Any intelligent person could master it in half a day, and publish a decent-looking web page, which could be seen on PC, Mac or UNIX workstations anywhere in the world. This was truly revolutionary. The XML and &quot;semantic web&quot; at the first glance is just a natural extension along this road. But instead introduces another big layer of complexity, reduces the pool of programmers who can quickly master it, opens the door to innumerable new bugs and inefficiencies.If HTML opened a new chapter in computer history, XML and its companion technologies do not. It is filling the same chapter with comments and footnotes until the text becomes illegible.	2001-04-25

All this can add spice and fullness to the narrative. The problem is that there is little else beside self-absorbed chatter, looking more like a reminiscence of a romp during an extended spring break vacation than a credible journalistic work. <br />As a young girl just out of college, she was expected at first to know little about the places she planned to visit. But it almost seems she makes a point of deliberately staying clueless throughout her travels. In Zimbabwe, where she went specifically to see elephant poachers being hunted down by special military squads, she find herself totally unprepared in the middle of nowhere, until being rescued by Australian soldiers. May be if she wasn't so busy sleeping with other women's boyfriends, she could at least learn something about the regional geography and what to put in her backpack. <br />Her version of feminism, expounded at length throughout the book, sounds more like a trivial egotism rather than a principled position. She expects as a given support, comfort and sex from men she encounters when she needs it, but is never too long to resort to petulant tirades in the &quot;male chauvinist pigs&quot; fashion whenever things turn out not exactly to her liking.<br />Deborah Copaken Cogan describes her brief - less than four years - career as a photojournalist in miscellaneous messy spots around the globe. She offers no shortage of sentiments about making it in a \\"notoriously macho\\", male-dominated world of adventure and war photography, but one isleft with doubt whether she was really trying. <br />She started to seek adventures at the end of her Harvard years in readily available and marginally thrilling places, such as the &quot;Combat Zone&quot; - puritanical Boston's puny version of a red-light district, with drug addicts, pimps and flashers. Then In February 1989 she goes abroad to war-torn Afghanistan hoping to &quot;...  see some dead or bloody mujahed, or some dead or bloody Russian soldier, or some mujahed firing off his Kalashnikovs, or one of those great big Soviet tanks whose names I can never remember, or, well, something that looks vaguely warlike&quot;.<br />Apparently, nobody told her that Soviet Army was practically withdrawn by that time. Russians didn't blast the mountain slopes with artillery shells - various bands of mujaheds did it to each other. No Mi-24 helicopters swooping down the valley to destroy rebel convoys and guerillas shooting them out of the sky with \\"Stingers\\". Instead we are treated with war stories about crushed packs of tampons and passing Tic-Tacs as medicine to dirt-covered children. She makes herself a nuisance to her hosts because of their strict privacy customs, resulting in one rebel soldier getting his legs blown off by a mine when checking a pathway for her so she could go pee off the road.  <br />D. Copaken is genuinely surprised that these Stinger-supplied rebels often shout &quot;Down with America!&quot; while perpetually cleaning their AK-47. Oh, she must have thought all they wanted to do was go to the Disney World, if only Soviet troops just let them.<br />One of the persistent impressions throughout the book is how little empathy she feels towards the objects she seeks with her camera. Her only human interest is some thrills for herself and another photo opportunity for her career. In Zimbabwe the author finally got her lens on a freshly killed (almost by her request) poacher - an unlucky fellow probably just trying to feed his family, and now left to rotin the jungles. In her own words she &quot;descended on him like a vulture&quot; for the best photo shot. When finding herself in one of the Romania's worst orphanages, for the most crippled and deformed children, she descends into shrilly hysterics - not because she feels anything for these kids, but because hideous surroundings offend her aesthetic comfort.<br />Later, in Moscow, in the midst of the August 1991 coup the author encounters a crowd of protesters carrying anti-coup slogans, written in Russian. She then seriously advises the carrier of one banner to rewrite the slogan in English instead - otherwise what's the point of the whole thing if cameras of western reporters would not be attracted to some familiar words. Is she for real? From somebody who has been around the world, one could expect a bit more sophistication than this uniquely American form of solipsism - that things aren't happening unless they are on CNN. Not from this girl - throughout the book she seems to make a point of firmly sticking to the flattest of media stereotypes.<br />Incidentally, I've recently read a better work of reporting and memoirs involving love, sex, adventure and war, by a Russian journalist Daria Aslamova (some excerpts available at [...]) in her \\"Adventures of a bad girl\\" series. She describes her experience from countless flings in the university dormitory to liaisons with celebrities and politicians and to wars in Caucasus, Nagorny Karabakh and the former Yugoslavia. Once she was captured and raped at a gunpoint by a militant of one warring side - a condition for sparing the lives of her companions, captured together. From love and lust to danger and death, she covered it with far more warmth, wit, and vigor than the author of the &quot;Shutterbabe&quot;. Interestingly, judging by the descriptions in both books of the coup in Moscow, she and D. Copaken Kogan could be within a few feet from each other during the decisive night of August 20, 1991. Game of chance can produce interesting patterns, indeed.	2001-04-01
US	49565153	R1YKH7HNWA9R9H	0070267006	933631979	Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia	Books	3	9	9	N	N	New Innocents Abroad	Would you buy a book entitled &quot;How I was trying to sell beer in a country X and blew it&quot;? Probably not. What about &quot;How I traveled with pirates, battled dragons, saved princess, selling beer overseas&quot;? In fact &quot;Moscow Madness&quot; promises on its cover jacket an adventurous tale in the latter style, while delivering for the most part a fairly mundane business story.<br />Embellishment of one's foreign adventures goes back to times earlier than Marco Polo or even Homer. But what is remarkable about this book is that it is actually more honest, plausible, and conventional that juicy tag lines and excerpts on its cover. It is a story of some business successes and mishaps, cultural discoveries and misunderstandings, under the titillating wrap of crime, corruption and debauchery. Many of such stories could happen elsewhere, almost all of them - in any country during big transformation.<br />What about the omnipresent &quot;mafiya&quot; and &quot;roofs&quot;? Contrary to widespread perception and come-ons of the book cover, one can find that Mr. Grajirena (the book protagonist) and his company weren't threatened by &quot;mafiya&quot;. A couple of times they considered doing business - on their own initiative - with shady-looking characters, and eventually declined. Most of the talk about &quot;mafiya&quot; in the book is a collection of keg party gossips and third-hand accounts. This doesn't mean that &quot;mafiya&quot; and corruption didn't exist - there were (and still are) plenty of them; it just wasn't completely unavoidable.<br />It is a common knowledge that many western businessmen trying to do business in Moscow during 90's were in constant danger for their lives, right? Actually, statistics tells a different story. The only relatively high-profile American businessman killed in Moscow in a whole decade was Paul Tatum - co-owner of a luxury hotel complex. Tatum adopted &quot;mafiosi&quot; style more enthusiastically than any &quot;New Russians&quot;, surrounding himself with thuggish bodyguards and miniskirted bimbos, and swam in chaos and corruption like fish in the water. Even many of his fellow American expats said they saw it coming.<br />A few years ago I witnessed (in US) an attempt to make a payment in a Russian-American business deal with a suitcase of dollars (the only time I've seen a suitcase full of cash in my life). No, it wasn't a stereotypical group of heavyset Russian &quot;biznismeny&quot; flashing piles of cash to the consternation of their American partners. Americans were the ones who brought the suitcase. The deal was in fact was totally legitimate, and neither side had any connections with organized crime How did they come up with this idea? Probably read too many stories about business in Russia, which supposedly operated only on bags of green banknotes.<br />The book details the story of Rick Grajirena, a renowned yachtsman, who previously ran a modestly successful business related to his sailing hobby. Nothing in his resume, however, suggested he should excel in selling beer in Moscow. In starting a business in a foreign country it would be helpful to have a thorough knowledge of either a country or a business itself. Grajirena didn't know much about either Russia or beer wholesaling. This is not an absolute prerequisite, but neither did he show enough concentration, jumping for a while from one project to another. Miller beer distribution came up only by chance, after dabbling in some other semi-serious ventures without particular focus or expertise. Why did he feel entitled to success?<br />Probably it had to do with the general atmosphere of the times. Many westerners in early 90's were attracted by a combination of the \\"new frontier\\" thrill, sense of self-important mission of \\"converting heathens\\", and expectation of easy buck along the line \\"these Russians are so clueless about business and capitalism, anybody barely able to operate a hot-dog stand should be raking inmoney&quot;. If this was ever true at all, it was quickly becoming less so as market reforms took hold.<br />In 1990 one could ride in a taxi around Moscow for half a day for just a pack of &quot;Marlboro&quot;. It would be stupid to assume this will persist forever - and such attitude seems to be one of the causes of the First Republic eventual failure. In early 90's selling something with American brand name was easy. But the market rapidly matured. Hundreds of new consumer goods were appearing each month. The previous assumption that any western-made product will be snapped up instantly was no longer true. Prices, rents and salaries rapidly increased in dollar terms. In the beer market competition become very tough, with many foreign and new domestic entries available. Some problems they encountered were related to Miller Brewery itself. Once a large shipment of beer froze because Miller neglected to put it in insulated packaging.<br />As the company, after many successful months, encountered difficulties (stemming, as evident in the book, primarily from increased competition, and only to some extent due to red tape, chaotic regulations or corruption) they invited American consultants to make recommendations for improvements. Author then pours scorn on these consultants - they seemed to lack credentials they claimed. Ironically, some of their advices seem quite reasonable. Basically their suggestion was for Mr. Grajirena to behave less like an arrogant colonialist expecting almost to be carried on stretchers by obedient servants.<br />There is a story at the end of the book about young American lawyers - a \\"golden couple\\" with \\"bright future\\". The girl came to work in Moscow, was excited by its wild atmosphere and went into clubbing, drugs and promiscuity, left her husband, became addicted and even reportedly attempted a suicide. A stern warning - don't even dare to think that \\"bright future\\" can be anything other than working 80-hours week on some mind-numbing legalese and returning at night to a trophy home in a prestigious suburb. For many such wisdom will suffice, some others will still find more places around the world for adventure and \\"madness\\".	2001-02-25
US	49565153	RU3CKJB82K1X8	0393049647	605138821	Failed Crusade: America and the Tragedy of Post-Communist Russia	Books	3	21	32	N	N	Failed Consistency Check	This book has a single point to drive home. Since the fall of communism US spent a lot of efforts to remake Russia \\"as a copy of itself\\" - and blew it. It is written from the perspective of a left-wing academic. Mr. Cohen personal preferences are obvious, and very subjective - in particular passionate dislike of Yeltsin and a total admiration of Gorbachev - the darling of American liberal intelligentsia.<br />Some of the author's inconsistencies are obvious. For example, he blasts IMF-prescribed policy of shock therapy. But in one of the 1993 articles, which is part of the book, he castigates then Prime Minister Chernomyrdin for - guess what? -  mentioning the IMF program in less than beacon-of-light terms. One could find dozens of other similar examples.<br />Was there actually a &quot;crusade&quot;? As they say on Wall Street - &quot;Don't confuse intelligence with a bull market&quot;. A free-for-all gold rush of hordes of consultants, advisers, and &quot;transitionologists&quot; (in author's words) shouldn't be mistaken for a consistent policy, based on clear principles and firm economic foundations. What appeared to be a bonanza to thousands of consultants was actually miniscule in macroeconomic terms. Some of the western advice in early 90's was helpful, some - clearly counterproductive.<br />Contrary to the widespread perception about \\"billions of US taxpayers money wasted on Russia\\" the amount of American aid was very small (and with a lot of strings attached) - a fraction of, for example, the amount steadily going to Israel and Egypt. Most of the reputed billions were either earlier debt rescheduling or interest-bearing IMF or World Bank credits, which Russia never failed to pay back. A couple of billions went into disarmament and counter-proliferation efforts - issues just as vital to US as to Russia itself. Some long-term agricultural export credits looked more like subsidies to American farmers, which only hurt Russian producers.<br />Mr. Cohen claims that throughout the Yeltsin presidency US media was constantly overoptimistic, overlooking huge problems and deteriorating situation. Oh, really? Here is the representative list of about 70% of Russia-related headlines from the Time Magazine - typical of the mainstream media and well aligned with Clinton administration foreign policy views - in the first 10 months of 1994. This period was relatively quiet - no major scandals, coups, or catastrophes, less economic turmoil than in previous 2 years, and before the start of the Chechen war. Surely the headlines must be full of glossing over and cheerful optimism as claimed by the author? Let's have a look:<br />Jan 31, &quot;Interview: A U.S. economist says hyperinflation may be next&quot;. March 7, &quot;Relations between cold-war rivals threaten to devolve into a cold peace&quot;. March 14, &quot;What happens when big bad bear awakes? Moscow's neighbors fear they may fall prey to a new post-Soviet empire&quot;. April 11, &quot;Headache of the state: rumors about Boris Yeltsin's health and alcohol problems are giving the Kremlin a hangover&quot;. July 4, &quot;Russia: Moscow's Identity Crisis. Buffeted by change, the once proud capital seems adrift&quot;. August 8, &quot;The Great Crash: The country's largest investment fund collapses&quot;. August 29, Cover story. &quot;Formula for terror: the former Soviet arsenal is leaking into the West, igniting fears of a new brand of nuclear horror&quot;. October 24, &quot;Ruble Run: The problems underlying the currency panic&quot;. November 7, &quot;A huge oil spill fouls Russia's far north, raising specters of Alaska's Exxon Valdez disaster&quot;.<br />Does all of this seem like glossy, rose-colored reporting? More like sneering and poking accusing finger at every spot. In fact it is not easy to find any positive headline related to Russia in any of American publication. Sometimes it gets simply ridiculous. From one of those 1994 Time articles describing then Russian PM: &quot;Chernomyrdin is handicapped by a biography ... a proletarian turned technocrat from the Russian hinterlands works his way to the top in Moscow&quot;. Hello? Isn't in US such upward mobility a perennial stuff of mushy, hand-on-the-heart, drenched-in-patriotic-tears incantations about &quot;only in America such dream can come true&quot;? But for Russia - where everything must be bad - such thing means &quot;handicapped&quot;! The only thing looking handicapped here is the logic of the author of this passage.<br />Incidentally, practically all of these panicky and mean-spirited headlines turned out to be wrong. Inflation was much less than in 1992-93, relations with US were cooling but smooth, not a single time in a decade Russia threatened force against any East  European or Baltic countries, the oil spill in the Arctic was tiny relative to Exxon-Valdez catastrophe. Despite countless Hollywood flicks in which a stolen Russian atomic bomb was a latest status symbol of every self-respecting terrorist, there is no evidence that even a small amount of weapon-grade nuclear materials was ever smuggled out.<br />Yet the mood of majority American media was nearly unanimous - nothing positive could ever happen in Russia. At times it could be reluctantly dragged along with the \\"civilized world\\", but otherwise was bound to remain inscrutable, backward and dangerous. I don't believe in some orchestrated media or policy conspiracy (although professional Russia-haters like Brzezinsky were always influential in foreign policy circles). More like the inertia of decades-long Cold War stereotypes, and a simple understandable desire to gloat about seeing a long-time rival down.<br />At the same time a collective stereotype appeared in relation to other post-Soviet countries. Just freed from Russian domination and though temporarily struggling, most of them happily march towards democracy and prosperity under the wise fatherly guidance of America and other western countries. Reality is quite different. Transition was excruciatingly painful for all former communist block countries. It is telling, for example, that in 1993-95 most of E. European countries former communist parties (under new names) were voted back to power. Today the economic situation in most of the former Soviet Union and some E. European countries is far worse than in Russia - an issue totally ignored in Cohen's book.	2001-02-15

Later, in the second half of the decade a new impetus was added - rapid development of the Internet and new telecommunication technologies. The olden stuff of economic theories - business cycle, limits of non-inflationary growth - seemed quaint and irrelevant. Isn't today's economy all about &quot;faster, not bigger&quot;, bits, not atoms, megabytes per second, not megatons? Not so fast, argued Paul Krugman in this book. It turns out that problems and issues relegated to the history museum have a knack of coming back with a vengeance.<br />&quot;The Return of The Depression Economics&quot; doesn't mean that the whole world is about to experience the equivalent of the global &quot;Great Depression&quot; of 1930's. Rather, that many countries are now facing problems similar to big issues that occupied economists and policy-makers in the wake of the great shock of world economy in 1930's. At the core of these problems is a massive and long-term demand failure that some economies experience in the aftermath of previous booms. Unlike a recession - a temporary downturn which can be cured by lowering interest rates (injecting money into financial markets), a depression is a state of the economy so out of balance and with destroyed credibility of the financial system, that extra central banks money or fiscal programs is not transferred into productive investments, but stashed away into savings (or leave the country), which further decreases consumption and reinforces downward cycle.<br />&quot;Depression economics&quot; - a classical Keynesian approach originated from the Great Depressions - deals with problems that are usually tackled by &quot;demand-side&quot; recipes. Its own failures since then led to the emergence of the \\"supply-side\\" economics in the late '70-early `80s. It concentrated on unclogging the production side of the market equilibrium - such as cutting taxes, deregulation and privatization. Solid economic foundations of such policies were somewhat lacking (Krugman even dismissively calls them &quot;crank theories&quot;), but it did help solving some problems that plagued western economies in previous decades.<br />This set of recipes, however, created its own problems. In case of &quot;emerging markets&quot; these prescriptions are incorporated in IMF and \\"Washington Consensus\\" orthodoxy. Although seemingly unrelated, they had much in common with \\"supply-side\\" ideology. They include restrictive anti-inflationary monetary policy, privatization, deregulation, opening to foreign markets and generally reducing role of the state. At first they seemed to be successful. In particular they led to dramatic reduction of inflation, endemic in the many developing countries. But that, as it increasingly turns out, was an easy part. The crises of the last several years, which P. Krugman describes in details, occurred precisely in those countries that accepted IMF polices. Like with any orthodoxy, the assertion that the causes of these crises are that these countries didn't adhere to them strictly enough doesn't have much merit - the real world never fully conforms to theories.<br />Many states in fact repeated the boom-bust cycle along the similar lines. At first a monetary \\"shock therapy\\" succeeds in stamping inflation - for good, it seems. Domestic and foreign capital flows into privatization projects, government and corporate bonds, attracted by high interest rates prescribed by IMF policies. But country's immature financial system is unable to fully digest the influx of money. This leads to rapid overheating of comprador parts of the economy - nascent stock markets and real estate prices in the nation's capital. Inflation is re-ignited, though to a lesser degree. As the exchange rate is kept steady, soon the country's currency becomes overvalued, and a big trade deficit develops because of uncompetitiveness of the country exports. At the same time local demand stagnates (except the parts directly connected to foreign capital inflow), much of the country plunges into severe depression.  At first this usually doesn't concern visiting IMF officials and foreign consultants, seeing new 5-star hotels and Mercedes dealerships. But then markets begin to smell trouble. Triggered by some crisis, interest rates suddenly shoot up and capital stampedes out, forcing the government to spend even more of its budget to pay debts and defend its currency. IMF may come up with a bailout package, but it represents only a temporary solution, solving none of the fundamental problems. Sometimes the crisis abates, leaving a country with bigger debt and more precarious long-term conditions; sometimes it can culminate in a huge storm, like 1997-98 crises that swept many \\"emerging markets\\".<br />These storms that Krugman describes in his book are the crises of globalization, brought about by extreme liquidity and instability of the world financial system. Consider an irrigation system consisting of many reservoirs of various sizes and shapes, connected by a network of pipes and channels. One day a big name engineering consultant appears and prescribes full opening of all sluices and floodgates for more efficient water circulation. At first glance this has only advantages. But when things turn bad (as they inevitably do once in a while) it can affect smaller parts much worse than if they were more shielded from the rest of the system. Big tides and storms mean only fluctuations for larger pools, but can completely drain little reservoirs and devastate weaker areas.<br />It is no surprise that today one of the most precarious financial conditions exist in Argentine - a country that was theposter child of the IMF programs and &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; philosophy. This philosophy seems stuck in ideas of 10 or more years ago, with very little accommodation of new experience. It is failing now and succumbing to problems already encountered long ago - but where new solutions are called for.	2001-02-09
US	49565153	R3VQ5BFRX813A0	0871138190	754092812	Four Blondes	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Pleasure and pain and everything vain	A reader of this book shouldn't (and wouldn't) look for deep, sharp observations or artsy, elevated style. It is expected to be naughty, catty, titillating and exploitive. Nothing wrong with it, such a book would have its place under the Sun (as in beach reading) as well as on bookshelf, and can be truly enjoyable and witty. Alas, &quot;Four Blondes&quot; delivers the goods only partially at best.<br />It starts with the juiciest story, most profusely sprinkled with a sugar-and-spice combo of glamour and trash. Its heroine, Janie Wilcox, an aging model, is drifting in society circles without a family or a stable career. Seems like a poor pretty girl whose time is fast slipping by, reminding me of the lines from &quot;Casanova&quot; by &quot;Nautilus Pompilius&quot; (somewhat lost in translation): `...Where have you been when they've been building a raft /   For you and all those who're drifting on ice-floe...'<br />Not quite. She is actually &quot;empowered&quot;, not in a classical feminist sense, but in judicious gold-digging ways, granting sexual favors to useful rich men seemingly at leisure and at her own discretion, and not looking too desperate at it. Still it seems contrived. There is nothing wrong with some choosy gold-digging, yet her case looks a little cheap. All this trouble just for summer free-ranging in Hampton, going to the same parties with the same people that, as admitted in the story, long ago bored to death with each other? She could be aiming higher, even in her own glittery/trashy ways. <br />We are treated with fascinating revelations, such as &quot;all rich men she'd been with turned out to be freaks and perverts&quot;. Of course they are, readers will appreciate this insight. It's a valuable piece of knowledge that makes the lives of many of us who don't own houses in Hampton bearable enough. Still these &quot;rich men&quot; are not complete waste, just enough to provide a few juicy sexual tidbits for the story.<br />In one respect the author is slightly old-fashioned - the rich and predatory (and, of course, perverted and insecure) men in her stories are the &quot;old money&quot; of entertainment and media executives, publishers, producers, etc. A whole stratum of overnight dot-com millionaires is touched with a 10-foot pole: &quot;Aren't those Internet guys boring?&quot; - as the heroine refuses to attend one of those dot-com launch parties. Of course they are, but sorry, Ms. Bushnell, this is simply running away scared. Just imagine, what an opportunity for glorious trashing of snotty rags-to-riches (and by now satisfactorily back to rags) asocial geeks is missed! To the author's credit, however, the second chapter contains some really witty observations of the ...(dot).com (authors and reviewers) crowd.<br />Candice Bushnell definitely has problem with endings. None of them in these four stories are great, or even passably good. They aren't lame enough to be either classical mushy happy endings, or stern morality tales where flighty sinners are punished for their empty lives. Nor they contain any good surprises. Each of them is fairly OK, in a small way, but so uninspiring and anticlimactic.<br />The second story is probably the best written of the book - because it is so merciless in mocking its main characters. It introduces &quot;very important people with very important jobs&quot; - a power couple in NY media circles. They are so right and politically correct, from the first paragraph the edifice of polished blandness towers over a reader like a generic NY skyscraper. Author proceeds to wickedly deconstruct them as a couple for several pages, stripping both of any vitality, by itinerating things that they don't like or approve in other people. And then she continues to prune them separately, until only empty skeletons left, with things that they don't like about each other. They both engage in brief affairs that don't even have an aura of a furtive sin, desperation or even genuine boredom. Instead they feel like an episode of a job-training program, a corporate seminar  \\"7 ways to exhibit your human side\\". Suits them well.<br />The third story, about a young beauty that married a prince (not Dark or Charming, just his official title), is completely forgettable. She discovered that the nuptial package includes life in a fishbowl, nosy reporters, lack of friends and so on. Yeah, right. Haven't we heard this story about a poor bird in a gilded cage thousands times before? It would be more appropriately called \\"Platitude\\" instead of \\"Platinum\\".<br />The last chapter, set in London, is the most catty of all. At first Candice Bushnell describes English sex appeal (male and female) in such wicked terms as to warrant bringing back Her Majesty expeditionary corps to hang all of New York's society and gossip columnists at every available lamppost. In the middle of the story the heroine meets some true British blue-blood noble, who surely must be the epitome and quintessence of all these unenviable qualities. Then Ms. Bushnell suddenly flips on her back, paws playfully up, and ends up purring something utterly tame (and lame) along the lines \\"... three days later they crawled out of a bed\\". I suspect Albion dwellers don't deserve the trashing the author gave them at the beginning of the story (at least not all of them). But even nastiness could be more consistent, presented with honor, perseverance and a stiff upper lip. Besides, exactly who gives a damn about rehabilitation of  sexual reputation of some British heraldic fossil with a ridiculously long compound name? Alas, the end could be more interesting...	2001-02-03
US	49565153	R11J7U3W1H398G	0670891681	979604748	Buddha's Little Finger	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Confusion � in and out	This is a book of, and about, confusion. Mental ward patients, imagining themselves as famous civil war characters, rugged Bolshevik generals as Zen philosophers. Artsy high-society conversations, dialogues of drunken mobster, and fantasies involving the corniest Hollywood flicks with Arnold Schwarzenegger scrambled together in a weird tasting salad of a fiction book.<br />The author most probably is no stranger to confusion himself. Pelevin grew up in the northern Moscow suburb of Dolgoprudny - on the surface just as drab and faceless as many others. It is unique, however, in one respect: it is a home of PhysTech, the best college in natural science and technology, Russian equivalent of MIT (and my alma mater). It has also certain parallels to Yale or Columbia, where pleasant campuses are situated right in the middle of gritty inner city poverty, and where Ivy League preppies walk the leafy alleys between hallowed auditoria to write term projects and papers on, among other things, diversity and multiculturalism; after dark a SafeRide shuttle drives them around town, shielding privileged students from a little bit too real multicultural world outside, warts and all. <br />Dolgoprudny during late Soviet era was also a rough neighborhood. Not just working-class, it also had a large percentage of &quot;limita&quot; - poor migrants from faraway provinces working unattractive jobs for Moscow residence permit. Street roughs didn't mesh easily with whiz kids - future rocket scientists. They were quite right to hate PhysTech geeks: their prettiest girls liked to hang out at campus discotheques and had a habit of losing virginity in our bedbug-ridden dorm rooms. Occasionally students were attacked on poorly lit streets around campus or on pathway to commuter rail station to Moscow. We didn't have campus police and a SafeRide. The best way to protect ourselves was to quickly, at a notice of an attack, to gather available manpower at the nearest dorm and run to the streets tochase these hoodlums. Pelevin mentioned in one interview that he participated in these skirmishes  - on the side of street roughs. He wasn't one of the \\"limita\\" kids though. Instead, he was of relatively comfortable soviet middle class background and was later a student in another Moscow college, albeit not as prestigious as PhysTech. More confusion.<br />PhysTech campus, with rows of grim rectangular buildings, wasn't a pretty place. Yet it was one of the freest spots one could find in Soviet Union. Authorities kept us at much longer leash than the state censorship would normally allow. As long as these geeks had shown promise to design better missiles and lasers, they could be spared crude forms of Soviet indoctrination. Inside these nondescript buildings there was an astonishing variety of creative life. Rock concerts, zany student theatrical performances, brilliantly made wall-sized newspapers (sometimes three-dimensional constructs), and funniest April Fools pranks surpassed everything I've seen later at the best American campuses. Interestingly, creativity extended to the other side of the Dolgoprudny social divide. Aside from best-selling Pelevin, the town also produced one of the best rock bands of the late 80's-early 90's - \\"Duna\\", composed of those street roughs we always tried to avoid on the way to train station.<br />Confusion of this book certainly doesn't end with readers, in particular of the English translation. Many mistook it for a scathing parody of the early Soviet propaganda hero - Red Army commander Chapaev. It is not, although appears natural for western readers who assume that Soviet pop culture was mostly propaganda (which was itself a Cold War-era propaganda idiocy of the western side). In Russia mocking Soviet-era heroes and indoctrination was already passé in 1991; by 1995 it was simply irrelevant.  This Soviet classic (a book and a movie) was long before superceded by a hilarious serious of jokes about Chapaev and his sidekicks Pet'kaand Anka. I hardly remember the movie (I've probably seen it once at age of 10 or so) but I still remember dozens of jokes. Huge popularity of these jokes can be illustrated by a one of their own kind: somebody dies and enters the Great Beyond (since he was a well-known person, its a kind of VIP section). A guide who explains how things are working there shows him around.  &quot;Basically, everybody is relatively OK, having a quiet comfortable life. There is one catch though - every time somebody tells a joke about you back on Earth, you roll over. See, for example, over there, there is Khrushchev, just flipped again, over there - Nixon...&quot; &quot;Gee, why it is so chilly here?&quot; - shivers the new arrival - &quot;those two fans are spinning like mad!&quot; &quot;Oh, those aren't fans&quot;, explains the guide, &quot;they are Chapaev and Pet'ka!&quot;<br />The constant theme of these jokes was the folksy oafishness of the whole pack - drunken debauchers and bunglers Chapaev and Pet'ka and their vaguely sluttish companion Anka &quot;the machine-gunner&quot;. Pelevin's quirky high-society image of Chapaev and Anka in &quot;Buddha's little finger&quot; is a parody on these innumerable jokes, not the &quot;official propaganda&quot; of the Soviet times.<br />Is the book itself worth it? It's hard to write a long story around a few jokes, albeit good ones, even more so around parodies on these jokes. This is probably as good as it could get, but still not quite satisfying. It is quintessential Pelevin, but somehow not his best. One can find some funny dialogues, scathing satire and delightful absurdities. Don't look for depth, or exquisite subtlety, however - it's not there. Some readers would find it sincerely enjoyable; others would feel the presence of that all-destroying Buddha's little finger - pointed at the hours spent in reading this book.	2001-01-30

With so many reviews already available, there is no need to repeat main arguments of this extremely interesting and well-written book. I'll rather concentrate on several of the most controversial issues.<br />It is impossible to write a comprehensive treatise on world history, which will not induce attacks on political and cultural grounds. Some critics blamed J. Diamond for advocacy of pure geographic determinism, that &quot;culture doesn't matter&quot; and so on. I think it is unjustified. He considered foremost the time before and during emergence of agricultural and, consequently, sedentary societies, not today's civilizations. When human population consisted of small bands and, later, tribes, their development was determined by environmental factors. Indeed, evidence from all continents suggests similarities in the emergence of domesticated plants, agriculture, and village life, starting about 10.000 years ago. The difference was in speed of this process - faster in places of benign environment, where food resources allowed denser population, slower in more adverse areas. As human societies grew in complexity and technological and cultural sophistication, more nonlinear interactions and feedbacks emerged. Then geography had likely to become less of a decisive factor, at least in a relatively straightforward way described by J. Diamond.<br />Moreover, history of the last few thousand years didn't resemble anything like the linear ascendance of the Western Europe. Western civilization achieved its dominance right at the moment when advances in ship-building and navigational technology brought the era of &quot;great geographic discoveries&quot; starting in 1492, which led to colonization of much of the world. Had seafaring been more developed before, during the Islamic dominance of several centuries earlier, or had China not scrapped its fleet and long-range exploration plans in early XV century, the world history of the last five hundred years could be very different.<br />Some readers took issue with the author's statement that &quot;average Guinean is probably smarter than average westerner&quot;. It is indeed highly debatable, even with the notion of &quot;smartness&quot; very different for different people. However, if one puts aside cheap chauvinism, one can see that there is something to this statement. A Guinean lives in a very diverse natural environment. He constantly needs to actively process (in contrast to, say, watching TV) large amount of information relevant to his essential survival and well-being. Another reason is that the Darwinian &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mechanism still works in tribal New Guinea, while amenities of the modern consumer society allow procreation of relatively unattractive, inept and stupid people.<br />Primary enabling factors of early civilization developments was the availability of domesticable plants and animals. Interestingly, the role of animals, as follows from the author's discourse, was much greater in this respect. Indeed, domesticated plants number many hundreds species, with each major agricultural regions having at least several developed crops. In contrast, large domesticable animals good for field work and transportation, are much rare. American continent and much of Africa didn't have suitable animals at all. Domesticated animals not only provide muscle power, but also make humans adaptable to germs. This allowed expansion into new regions with different germ population, which was one of the crucial factors in rapid conquering of Latin American territory by Spain.<br />In Jared Diamond view the ultimate cause of Eurasian (and later European) domination is the extent of the East-West axis - largest for Eurasia and much smaller for other continents. Latitude stretch of Eurasian landmass certainly did play a role, but it is likely overstated by the author. Total East-West extent of the Eurasia was probably irrelevant, and the history of Sumerian and Egyptian empires would likely have been similar even without the Europe west of Greece and the Asia east of Persia. The crucial property was the Mediterranean and the Middle East juncture (Fertile Crescent and neighboring coastal territories). Was it latitudinal dominance or a fractal coastline? The role of a long, winding coastline could be a very significant one. It provides a lot of beachfront and river estuary water resources, temperate seashore climate, great variety of flora and fauna from sea level to mountains nearby. All this ensures richness of resources sustaining high-density human population. At the same time such topography allows easy interaction, trade and exchange between settlements, while preserving pockets of diversity and preventing easy conquering and destruction by a dominant tribe, unlike in areas of open mid-continent plains. Indeed, it is evident in this book that the Fertile Crescent and two-river delta in China are the only places having this combination of climate, topography and biological resources.<br />To stress the importance of geographic factors and in particular availability of domesticable animals, the author mentions a curious fact - the absence of wheeled transport on American continent. To J. Diamond the failure of relatively advanced Mesoamerican cultures to develop wheeled transportation was due to the lack of any domesticated animals, which could be used to power them. Indeed, he argues, they had used wheels in toys, therefore they didn't lack technological creativity in this respect. I disagree with the author on this issue. There is a huge difference between a toy wheel - something rotating on an axis - and a working tool for transportation. The latter needs much higher degree of sophistication than many other contemporary technologies.  A wheel even in a simple wheelbarrow must be very round and well-balanced on an axle, have a very sturdy and low-friction axle and hub, firm but light and flexible stress-distributing spokes and stress-tolerant outer edge. A transportation carriage in addition to that needs to have a sophisticated amortization system for a smooth ride, and a suitable harness for the animal. Manufacturing an inexpensive, sturdy and reliable wheel for hauling and transportation was a very tough challenge. Still, the question of why Mesoamerican cultures hadn't developed a wheel requires further scrutiny. Perhaps the reason was related to available material technologies and quality of soil less suitable to build roads.	2001-01-25
US	49565153	RG573GZHGNKNH	089096856X	187974743	The War in Chechnya (Eugenia & Hugh M. Stewart '26 Series)	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Flawed account of a messy war	This book was touted as an objective and evenhanded analysis of the military side of the Chechen war of 1994-96. It is simply not so. In fact it often reads like a propaganda pamphlet, pro-Chechen and anti-Russian in this case.<br />To give it a due credit, the book has some strong points. It is sufficiently detailed and provides a complete timeline of the conflict. Its analysis of war, while very partial, contains some interesting insights (for example, on the role of military terrorism). At the same time one of the book's drawback is highly derivative description of the events. It seems the authors have never been anywhere near Chechnya or interviewed main participants of this war. Instead they rely almost exclusively on reports written elsewhere - mainly in Russian and western newspapers (and also Lithuanian ones).<br />The authors begin with political circumstances leading to war. Like other parts of the book the description is very biased. They hardly mention, for example, a series of terrorist acts and hostage-taking (including several instances of kidnapping buses with schoolchildren) persisting in and around Chechnya in 1994, which was a final trigger for hostilities as lawlessness and violence in Chechnya has grown to intolerable proportions. Any western government in these circumstances would be just as hard pressed to &quot;finally get tough on terrorists&quot; as Russian government in the late 1994. Both sides, Russian and Chechen, can be faulted for gradual escalation and eventual stumbling into the brutal war. Much more objective and substantial take on this issue can be found in A. Lieven's &quot;Chechnya: The Tombstone of Russian Power&quot;.<br />In describing the military side of the war S. Knezys and R. Sedlickas use many sketches and maps, with level of details sometimes down to individual vehicles destroyed or soldiers killed. These maps, however, often feel disconnected from the story and offer fairly little help in understanding combat situations. The narrative often resembles the language of a bureaucratic report. There is no comparison, for example, to the Mark Bowden's &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; in vividness of describing gritty details of military engagements in a modern war. In fact, the writing reminds of Prussian pedantry that Lev Tolstoy mocked in &quot;War and Peace&quot;: &quot;First battalion marches..., second battalion marches...&quot;. Authors managed to make one of the most ferocious combats in recent history simply boring.<br />They also use very unconventional English transliteration of names and locations (based, it appears, on Lithuanian spelling). Not that the authors make even this consistent. For example, Yeltsin spelled as traditionally in English literature, while phonetically similar first letter in other names is spelled with &quot;J&quot; (e.g. Jegorov, or sometimes Jagorov). The authors are fairly sloppy and occasionally spell the same name differently within a single page (for example, Dudaev's wife name is alternately called Ala, Alla or Ada). One of the authors (Knezys) was educated in Soviet Union and surely has at least a basic grasp of Russian. Yet Russian names and places mentioned in the book often sound as if they are distorted on purpose to lose original meaning. Is it a quirky excursion into Luthuanian nationalism? There is nothing wrong with presenting the point of view of smaller nations, but distorting grammar and phonetics for this purpose looks downright silly.<br />Describing humanitarian aspects of the war authors detail almost all  Russian atrocities ever mentioned in media, of various degree of credibility, but barely mention at all the Chechen ones, including well-documented horrible tortures and mutilation of captured Russian soldiers (and often civilians). They write, for example, how Chechens allegedly protected Russian POWs in the basement of Dudaev's presidential palace in Grozny, as Russian troops were storming it. What they don't mention is that Chechens fighters tied (and even nailed) many captured soldiers to windowsills, often stripped naked in January cold, while their snipers were shooting at attacking Russian troops using these prisoners as covers.<br />Almost every operation by Chechen forces is described as complete success from military point of view, while on Russian side - invariable bungling and failure. This is in line of how it was often portrayed in the media, but doesn't necessarily stand the scrutiny of common sense and logic (although Chechens indeed often proved to be very capable fighters). For example, authors describe Chechen attacks on parts of Gudermes in December '95 and of Grozny in March '96 as well-planned and perfectly successful &quot;rehearsals&quot; of the eventual operation to take Grozny in August '96, after which Russia decided to end the war and withdraw its troops. Despite being army officers, the authors apparently can't comprehend a simple concept: there is no such thing as a &quot;repetition&quot; of a military operation. In case a of pre-planned decisive strike, the army unit either completes its task, or fails at it and falls back to prepare and plan anew, with modified means and tactics, while the other side makes its own conclusions and designs countermeasures. Undoubtedly, had the Chechen army attack on Grozny in August '96 been not successful, they would have called it yet another &quot;planned rehearsal&quot;, just as previous operations in December '95 and March '96. Similarly, they call terrorist raids on civilian targets inside Russia by the bands of field commanders Shamil Basaev in June `95 and Salman Raduev in December '95 (fully justified in author's description, even as these attacks included cold-blooded killing of civilian hostages) as total successes from military point of view. This is arguably the case for the first raid (Basaev's), but less likely for Raduev's band, which lost more than half of its fighters (Raduev was recently captured by Russian special forces and is now in prison). <br />Overall, the book is too flawed to receive a high mark. Nevertheless, it remains the most detailed military account of Chechen war in the western media, and can be recommended to readers interested in this subject.	2000-12-28

In case of Russia, there is a tradition going back for centuries to look for some singular sinister figure behind every bad turn of history (best exemplified by famous Rasputin character). The &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin&quot; is a continuation of this dubious tradition. <br />The book begins with the &quot;Great Mob War&quot; of 1992-93, which followed the collapse of the old soviet institutions and beginning of large-scale redistribution of property. It did involve a great deal of violence and criminality, especially in Moscow, where local criminal gangs slugged it out with ethnic mobs from the south of the former Soviet Union, primarily Chechens. For the narration purpose, it is what the Moscow expat magazine &quot;The eXile&quot; aptly calls the &quot;death porn&quot; - lurid stories of crime and mob shootouts and killings, designed to titillate the imagination of couch potatoes without too much hypocritical hand-wringing about &quot;horrors of war&quot; or &quot;helping poor unfortunate people&quot;. To the author's credit, it is a well-researched  &quot;death porn&quot; of much higher quality and credibility than some other examples, such as &quot;Red Mafia&quot; by R. Friedman.<br />Mr. Klebnikov then proceeds to describe the messy and chaotic transition from communist rule in early 90's in Russia. Despite his education in London School of Economics, his perspective from economics point of view is fairly weak. He blames mainly the first post-communist government of Yegor Gaidar for the &quot;economic collapse&quot;. In fact most of the collapse occurred before the start of reforms. In December 1991 store shelves were virtually empty. Lifting the price control wasn't some fancy exercise of economic theories but the only sensible emergency measure allowing the country to move forward (although Gaidar government did make many mistakes afterwards). The author alleges that the value of ruble was close to one dollar before the beginning of reforms, and plunged hundreds times afterwards. In reality, just before the start of the Gaidar's price liberalization the black market rate for dollar was about 120 rubles, not close to parity as Klebnikov claims (unlike the author I remember these numbers from Moscow streets, not from phone interviews and reference search out of some plush corporate offices). Moreover, after January 2, 1992, while prices shot up, the ruble exchange rate actually increased to about 90 for dollar, until gradually sliding with inflation. Far from becoming worthless, ruble actually hugely appreciated against dollar in real terms, as trading and exchange became free. <br />P. Klebnikov mainly follows the line of criticism from Russian liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky, who at the time had his own reform program &quot;500 days&quot; which eventually was discarded in favor of that of Gaidar, Chubais, Yasin and their team. Much of this criticism is sour grapes on Yavlinsky's part. In fact his program was akin to some crank infomercial for a new diet, claiming that one can indulge in juicy steaks and sweet cookies and still lose weight. It didn't really stand a chance. Mr. Yavlinsky popularity (if any) in Russia stems from his constantly being in the spotlight, but never in government where he would have to actually share responsibility; and in the West - from his knack for schmoozing with US politicians and media elite.<br />The author then describes Berezovsky rise from &quot;a car dealer&quot; to a head of an extensive business empire and insider in Kremlin circles. Actually Berezovsky wasn't just a car dealer, but a fairly prominent academic who in the late 80's worked with VAZ - leading Soviet car manufacturer - on a consulting and software contract. As new economic opportunities opened up, he channeled his connections both in academic and car business world into various intermediary ventures. There were thousands of emerging businessmen like him previously from academic circles, though he was more successful than many others. He most certainly used these opportunities cynically and self-servingly, but not necessarily to such malevolent extent as alleged in the book.<br />Describing Berezovsky dealings, Paul Klebnikov takes a lot of cues from a disgruntled former Yeltsin's chief of presidential security (and his drinking companion) A. Korzhakov. This is far from an objective and credible source. Ironically, in 1994-96 it was Korzhakov himself who was viewed as a sinister &quot;new Rasputin&quot; running the whole country from the shadows. Korzhakov for some time did play a significant, and rather unsavory, role. In particular he called for scrapping 1996 presidential elections when Yeltsin popularity was low. In the end Yeltsin, despite the odds, decided to move forward and uphold the law and democratic procedures, and fired Korzhakov. Suddenly the &quot;all-powerful schemer&quot; of inflated imagination of western media was out on the streets. So much for \\"Rasputin\\".<br />Just as easily Berezovsky fell out of favor with the new government of president Putin in the last few months. It turned out he didn't single-handedly ran a show after all, contrary to what one might infer from Mr. Klebnikov's book. Today Berezovsky tries to reinvent himself as a &quot;defender of the democracy&quot;, donating money to Sakharov museum and running op-ed pieces in major US newspapers. Should American political elite feel more dissatisfied with increasingly assertive and independent line of the Putin new government, it wouldn't be hard to imagine the same media clowns who castigated Berezovsky as a sinister &quot;gray cardinal&quot; of the Yeltsin regime, trump him as &quot;voice for freedom&quot; against &quot;returning dictatorship&quot;. Then again, it would not be terribly new or surprising.	2000-12-19

Almost every investor can recall a story of an opportunistic broker or a Wall Street analyst who enthusiastically talks up certain stocks for months. Then, when things get very wrong and the stock tanks, he keeps telling he was basically right all the time, because here is this little fine-print qualifier in his report saying that for all these rosy predictions to become true this and that conditions must persist and this setback mustn't happen, and for the reasons beyond his control this haven't turned out to be, and so on. <br />\\"The Coming Internet Depression&quot; has a certain resemblance to such an analyst. Hardly anybody was more enthusiastic cheerleader of the &quot;New Economy&quot; than the &quot;Business Week&quot; where M. Mandel is an economic editor. To reconcile today's post-dot-com meltdown hangover with unbounded enthusiasm before April 2000 the author performs a partially convincing mind trick. There is an &quot;Internet Economy&quot; after all. But now - surprise! - it has its own downside and its downward cycle, which is also very different from the downward cycle of the &quot;Old Economy&quot;. He implicitly claims to have known about this all along, although one wouldn't have this impression leafing through the &quot;Business Week&quot; issues of 1995-99. But of course one can always find fine-print qualifiers even there.<br />To Mr. Mandel's credit, the book most likely have been started before April 2000, which suggests the author was actually shrewder than the overoptimistic tone of the &quot;Business Week&quot; coverage could suggests, and was anticipating the dot-com crash. In this sense, for example, the 1999 book &quot;The Internet Bubble&quot; by the &quot;Red Herring&quot; editors A. Perkins &amp; M. Perkins was earlier, less ambitious, and more specific and intellectually honest. It simply argued that even by very optimistic projection of a future cash flow there is no way one can justify valuations of dot-com companies at that time.Here, in the &quot;Internet Depression&quot; the author attempt a more ambitious task, conceptualizing the whole &quot;Internet Economy&quot;. It achieves, in my opinion, a mixed result. One of the problems is that the author doesn't really go deep in explaining his use of the term &quot;depression&quot; as opposed to &quot;recession&quot;, &quot;downturn&quot; or other terms. He defines a depression as a &quot;recession that is not followed by a quick and genuine recovery&quot;, then adds a few folksy quotes from past politicians along the lines of &quot;a recession is when your neighbor loses a job; a depression is when you lose a job&quot; and such. This is a rather fuzzy description from a respectable economist. It is like a doctor saying that the flu is simply a cold that lasts more than a week instead of a couple of days. More substantial and rigorous distinction can be found, for example, in Paul Krugman's &quot;The Return of Depression Economics&quot;.  A recession is usually a temporary excess of supply over demand and a liquidity crunch, which can be fairly quickly reversed by a monetary expansion and interest rates cut. A depression is a much more profound crisis when economy stops reacting to expansionary monetary signals and uncontrollably spirals downward into a &quot;liquidity trap&quot;. In other words, a recession is when a car ran out of gas, which can be remedied by filling the tank. Depression, on the other hand, is when the engine itself is out of order and requires more costly and elaborate fix - getting under the hood, cleaning filters and pipes, changing worn-out and broken parts. Simply adding gas and pushing the accelerator pedal won't do any good.<br />Consequently, as M. Mandel doesn't go too deep in exploring the nature and the structure of possible forthcoming depression, he largely views it as simply symmetrical unwinding of the positive feedback loop built during the boom years. The ascending phase is characterized by consumer optimism, stock market growth, large investments, high rate of innovation and rapid advances of productivity allowing to keep prices low; the descending phase - loss of consumer confidence, slumping market, slow innovation, weak productivity, high inflationary pressures.<br />At the core of this view is the author's concept of the driving force of today's US economy. The &quot;New&quot; in the &quot;New Economy&quot; is not the Internet itself, but rather a novel form of financing innovation - through the venture capital, which have grown enormously since the 1995 Netscape IPO. This is indeed an important and non-obvious conjecture. But is it valid? Venture capital so far proved to be a significant, but far from leading source of R&amp;D expenditures. To a large extent venture money went not to innovations themselves but rather into marketing and hype machine accompanying them. The overall business model of the venture capital industry itself in recent years was not as much to grow a viable and successful business, as to create a vehicle for hype and buzz - the most precious currency in the dot-com-mania period - which can be sold to over-eager investors. This works as long as the stock market goes up, but it is bound to crash and burn as NASDAQ sours. Such business model is like a sailing ship that has been designed and tested only for the down-wind course. What will happen when the wind turns into the opposite direction? <br />The recipes that the author proposes to overcome the upcoming depression look, although sensible, look remarkably conventional: keep interest rates down, don't engage in tariffs and trade wars, maintain a robust safety net. Among the more non-trivial propositions is to increase government spending on the research and development and training in high-tech skills, which he views as something of a modern version of the \\"New Deal\\" public works program. But let's face it - when a serious crisis will finally come, it won't go according to past predictions, and new assessments and recipes will be called for.	2000-11-30

Vinyl furniture! Nylon blouses! Polyester suits! This will completely change everything forever! &quot;The Metal World had predominant battleship-gray color... the Plastic World is shining bright and can have any color imaginable... The Metal World was full of giant smokestacks with rows of tall chimneys, resembling Titanic... The Plastic World is compact and mobile, with production anywhere one wants; ...heavy and rigid ... light and flexible...&quot;, and so on. One could fill a longer book with such passages than the &quot;Lexus and Olive Tree&quot; with its endless juxtapositions &quot;The Cold War World was... The Globalization World is...&quot;. <br />Not that this is completely wrong. Plastics, after all, did change a lot of things. Some things became crucial components of modern technology and consumer goods, some - useful and handy, but almost invisible and mundane. And some things became, well, polyester suits. Similar things will most likely happen to the globalization phenomena. Nobody will dig up fiber-optic cables and unplug web servers. Many things will have major impact but will not come out as predicted today. Lowering trade barriers and expanding capital flows solves some problems and creates new ones - for which completely new solutions will be needed.  Many other things are going to end up like polyester suits - and Tom Friedman amassed a lot of them in his wardrobe.<br />This one-dimensional outlook is, however, only one of the problems with this book. It is not an in-depth analysis of the most important trends of the current era (although it pretends to be one), but a simple though verbose cheerleading for much more narrow interpretation of it, also know as &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; - the official Imperial Ideology of the New World Order. To stress its highest approval by the Imperial Court he uses a fancy terms like &quot;golden straitjacket&quot;. There is no other alternative, he claims. Be assimilated or be destroyed. <br />For every little fad and fetish he invents names like &quot;Electronic Herd&quot;, &quot;DOS Capital&quot; - awkward and annoying slang; it is simultaneously the Newspeak and the Imperial Pantheon to be worshipped. This unabashedly imperialistic diatribe is spiced with obligatory politically correct references to the &quot;olive tree&quot; - so cute, but - ah, what a pity - destined to be destroyed under caterpillar tracks of history. No, Mr. Friedman is not interested in a &quot;balance&quot; with &quot;olive tree&quot; as he keeps mentioning it in passing. You better march straight forward and wave little shiny flags with  Imperial Court-approved logos of our brave invincible legions - competitive, future-oriented and environmentally-friendly (if you politely ask them to be with a few e-mails) transnational corporations. In the end there will be reward - a plastic toy from the Happy Meal package (there are two of them on the shelf; take the middle one). Otherwise several cruise missiles will point out a mistake in case anyone wanders away from the herd. &quot;The world needs McDonnel-Douglas (i.e. F-15) in order for MacDonalds to operate efficiently&quot;, and, remains unsaid, to carry this new &quot;white man's burden&quot;. At least R. Kipling was more honest and had much greater writing talent.<br />When reality doesn't conform, for T. Friedman this means only one thing (as it is clear from his many NYTimes columns) that there are still too many stupid backward people who have the temerity not to follow his codex of acceptable behavior, who refuse to be paved over by a strip mall with Golden Arches. Although he includes no shortage of touchy-feely sentiments about growing inequalities, winners and losers he mainly argues that the globalization along the his prescriptions is not only inevitable, but how it can potentially benefit everyone by allegedly creating a level-playing field, so that any underdeveloped country can just &quot;plug into the system&quot;. Really. <br />Imagine two pearl divers, called N. and S. The former owns much longer shoreline and collects many more pearls, though both operate within their own narrow strips of a beach. One day he suggests an attractive proposal to S. &quot;Before we searched only close to shores. Now things changed, we all need to swim in the open ocean, the whole sea is our oyster&quot;. They scrap all boundaries and start diving everywhere. At first, things are looking great; the catch is better. Suddenly sharks appear. Soon a high-speed boat appears and picks N. out of the water. &quot;Oh, didn't I mention I've had a rescue service subscription... You should've called them too...  Bye now!&quot; - tells N., speeding away. <br />The sharks will be coming one day or another, no matter how much a country adheres to Mr. Friedman silly prescriptions. When well-connected big boys, like LTCM, will screw up big time, one can be sure they will be rescued by Fed sugar daddies. When some far-away country gets in trouble, IMF will come to evacuate rich foreign bondholders and a few highly placed local plutocrats, leaving behind destruction, increased poverty and foreign debt in the wake of the &quot;electronic herd&quot; stampede. And Tom Friedman will write new columns, explaining that they must be punished for not following his theories enthusiastically enough, just a few months after cheering how great this country was doing by strictly following these theories. Incidentally, from purely financial point of view, the best way to profit in the international markets recently was to move against this &quot;electronic herd&quot;, lying low while this cattle stampedes and investing in the wake of the financial crises. If this celebrated &quot;electronic herd&quot; stayed solvent at all, it is due to the overall rise of the markets and various bailouts.<br />Sorry, Mr. Friedman, you don't look good in that polyester suit you call &quot;golden straitjacket&quot;. And peoples around the world should think carefully before putting it on.	2000-11-27

Gilder for many years had a reputation of the high-tech guru and the prophet of the &quot;Internet Era&quot;. How justified is it? In fact he missed the Internet revolution altogether. Back in 1994, when the first Mosaic web browsers spread all over computer screens on campuses like a brush fire, he wrote and talked in his interviews and columns about the same things as now - increasing bandwidth, fiber optic lines, cable, interactive TV. Internet was occasionally mentioned in passing, Web - not at all. But isn't the Internet all about bandwidth and megabits per second? No, it would be like saying that the PC revolution of the early 80's was all about increasing number of transistors. Growing transistor count was one of the enabling driving forces. The revolution itself was radical shift in business models and organizational structures, huge leap in availability of computing power at the fingertips of much greater number of people. Similarly, the Internet revolution was not about more bits per second - it was a rapid and momentous transformation of the whole business of accessing and exchanging information by individuals and organizations all over the world. And G. Gilder largely missed it. To his credit, most of the other &quot;gurus&quot; missed it just as well. This is a pesky trait of true revolutions - to fool and confuse all pundits and pontificators gazing into their crystal balls.<br />Mr. Gilder is also often cited for in-depth knowledge of scientific and technical aspects of the &quot;telecosm&quot;. I have an impression this reputation comes mostly from journalists who themselves understand very little of these technical issues, or those who do understand but directly benefit from his relentless promotion of certain technology companies. To be sure, there is no shortage of technical jargon, precise quotes of wavelengths and megabits scattered all over the book, copious panegyrics to &quot;erbium-doped amplifiers&quot; and the likes. Nevertheless, reading the &quot;Telecosm&quot; I constantly had an uneasy feeling whether the author really understands in depth the scientific and technological matters he discusses, or hides his lack of solid grasp of these issues behind the mystical vagueness. Sometimes the mistakes are obvious, like quoting supposedly 40% change of light wavelength in Michelson-Morley experiment; it should be about million times less than that. There is a rambling description of the polar lights being &quot;naturally occurring laser&quot; (in fact it is a very different phenomenon), and many other examples.<br />The book contains many stories about discoveries and development of various optical, laser or semiconductor technologies. Some of these stories are well-written and occasionally witty, but most can be found in other books and magazines; often they are incomplete and biased. For example, he includes a many pages long narrative about the invention of laser by Charles Towns, without even mentioning independent co-inventors Soviet scientists Basov and Prokhorov, who were co-recipient of the Nobel Prize with Towns for laser development.<br />The central idea, constantly repeated throughout this book, is prediction of the &quot;coming bandwidth abundance&quot;. G. Gilder's main argument is that each wave of technological innovation makes certain crucial and previously scarce ingredients so plentiful that the price goes virtually to zero and this radically changes the whole economic landscape. To some extent this is valid. But recall the promise of electricity from nuclear power that would be &quot;too cheap to meter&quot; - it didn't quite came true. Large increase in supply of these ingredients does not reduce their real cost close to zero. Most people still cringe at their electricity bills; a car with 180 h.p. V6 engine cost a couple of thousand dollars more than a similar one with a 120 h.p. 4-cylinder engine. Abundance changes numbers, but doesn't eliminate economic laws.<br />Another oftenrepeated idea is about the future dominance of &quot;dumb networks, with intelligence shifted to network's edges&quot;. It may turn out that in some parts of a network the sheer amount of bandwidth will be more advantageous relative to sophisticated and expensive switching or routing functions. But it is doubtful that this principle will hold true for much of the future communication infrastructure. But instead of business or technological arguments Mr. Gilder attributes to this idea some kind of religious and mystical significance. There are also some scientifically sounding phrases such as &quot;to have high-entropy content the network must have low entropy&quot;. I am still at loss to know which laws of math or physics this notion is based upon. <br />Near the end of the book Mr. Gilder lists his &quot;20 Laws of Telecosm&quot;. This chapter was probably the biggest disappointment. Among these 20 &quot;laws&quot; I haven't found a single one, which doesn't have very serious problems with consistency and credibility. Some of them vary from obvious to dubious (&quot;Telecosm requires better and better directories...\\", &quot;today's television is dead...&quot;), but these are the least of the problems of these &quot;Laws&quot;. Just a few examples:<br />2. &quot;Gilder Law&quot;, stating that the amount of bandwidth doubles each 6 months, three times faster than the computing power. That's apples and oranges. Moore's Law tells about increasing power of a single chip; Gilder talks about cumulative increase of all bandwidth in the world, which  is often of little relevance to majority of users stuck for many years with 56-Kb modems.<br />6-7. Shannon's Law and Corollary. &quot;Bandwidth is the substitute for power. The future is in low-power broadband devices...&quot;. This is based on the simplified and erroneous understanding of the Shannon's Law (presumably he means Shannon's formulae C=B*log(1+S/N), where B is bandwidth, C is information transmission capacity, S/N is a signal-to-noise ratio). This is a misnomer. Shannon's Law was a foundation of the modern communication theory, but hardly the guidance for actual technologies, which must take into account error-correction, nonlinear &quot;cross-talk&quot; effects and many other factors. Real communication systems are designed to all allocated bandwidth, and transmit minimal amount of power sufficient to reduce error rate to acceptable levels, which Shannon's expression doesn't describe.	2000-11-21
US	49565153	RCBXPU8O8HCE5	037550317X	389338120	When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management	Books	5	14	21	N	N	Surprise - arrogance and greed will get you in trouble	The cover of this book depicts pastel-toned neoclassical plaster façade structures, reminding of the ivory tower of academia or white-shoe inner halls of a prestigious bank. The story in this book, however, is anything but the picture of such serenity. Rather it is a story of unlimited hubris and greed, of billions of dollars lost in a blink of an eye, jagged lines flashing across computer screens, traders screaming into phones and sweating from anxiety, elegant academic theories crashing on the rocks of the real world. It is a fascinating story, culminating in the world-wide financial crisis and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management fund in September 1998, still fresh in the minds of many participants and observers. This book strikes a good balance between page-turning readability and substance and thoroughness in explaining relevant financial and mathematical concepts.<br />R. Lowenstein writes a solid explanation of the rise of computational finance and numerical methods used by Wall Street since early 70's. It was greatly facilitated by two factors. First - the collapse of the gold standard and Bretton Woods fixed currency regimes, which caused big fluctuations in currencies and interest rates, brought increased inflation and market volatility. The second crucial factor was emergence of adequate computing power by the early 70's - both powerful mainframe computers to crunch huge amount of financial data and hand-held calculators which traders could use on the exchange floor to compute option prices and other quantities. The volume of all kinds of financial transactions kept rising ever since. Future leaders of LTCM - the star trader J. Meriwether and his &quot;bond arbitragers&quot; group from Salomon Brothers, and the co-authors of the option pricing theory 1997 Nobel Laureates Merton and Scholes - were right in the center of this momentous transformation.<br />By early 90's &quot;quantitative methods&quot; were all the rage on Wall Street. Geeks with Ph.D. began replacing Gordon Gekkos and coke-snorting frat boys of the 80's as &quot;masters of the universe&quot;. At the road show to raise money for newly incorporated LTCM hedge fund its &quot;quants&quot; threw incomprehensible formulae and graphs - and plenty of insults - at prospective investors. Nevertheless they managed to amass more than a billion dollars to launch LTCM. Not surprisingly, even egos and vanity played second fiddle to greed.<br />As the book makes clear LTCM team was the most famous (and simultaneously most secretive) but hardly unique in this game. By mid-90's practically everybody was using fairly sophisticated mathematical methods. What set LTCM apart from others were old-fashioned connection network among Wall Street big guns who put their own money into new fund, self-enhancing mystique and reputation. This allowed LTCM to borrow money freely without &quot;haircut&quot; - minimal margin requirements to move around huge amounts of money to exploit small but persistent inefficiencies in capital markets. In one example mentioned by R. Lowenstein, one of the first LTCM large-scale bets was on the convergence of spread of about  .12% between Treasuries with 29.5 years to maturity and newly issued 30-years ones. This spread was small but not tiny. Many traders could notice that. But few could significantly profit from it, because it would require very high leverage (i.e. borrowing) which itself costs money, either in interest rates or &quot;haircut&quot;. Only LTCM with its connections could cross-borrow practically any amount of money without &quot;haircut&quot; and execute lucrative trades, which other firms could design but not take advantage of.<br />Although there is little doubt that LTCM packed an impressive clip of very intelligent people, it is arguable whether a touch of genius was present in these games at all. The book itself reaches mixed verdict in this regard. What is clear, however, is that they ran a strategy which was usuallywinning in &quot;normal&quot; times - without panics and severe financial crises or big interest rates moves - but was excessively risky when things become very turbulent. <br />In fact one doesn't need to be a genius to run this kind of scheme. Think of a boat designed to carry 30 people. Safety regulations usually ensure significant excess capacity, so in fact a boat can haul more passengers. If some rogue operator is somehow able to skip regulations he can put 50 people on board - and rake big profits most of the time. Then one day a big storm occurs - and the boat sinks. In a somewhat more advanced example, consider a following casino gambling strategy. Make a bet on something and after each round increase the bet by a constant multiplier larger than two (say, 2.1 or 2.5). Continue until winning and stop immediately after. Theoretically this will guarantee winning every time, though the amount will vary from day to day. Why doesn't everybody use this trick? Because on some rare occasions one can run out of money before a single win. The loss will be huge and negate overall gains of many winning days. It seems that LTCM ran a strategy resembling this scheme.<br />Should we expect meltdowns similar to LTCM in the future? Definitely yes. Like generals who always fight the last war, financial institutions and regulators know what to do with previous crises. But by the time the effects of the last crisis are overcome, new risky strategies with potential troubles of their own are designed, waiting to explode as new hundreds of billions of fool's gold rush in.	2000-11-19

Kuhn's works: a new book of his later essays &quot;The  Road Since The Structure&quot; is just published, as well  as fiercely critical of him book &quot;Thomas Kuhn: A  Philosophical History for Our Times&quot; by Steve Fuller.<br />&quot;The Structure&quot; deserves continued attention. It is a  rare feeling when reading a well-known book written a  while ago, that still retains a sense of novelty and  intellectual freshness. Like any true classics it is not  an easy reading. This is not a polished, refined textbook.  Often it has a feel of 18-century philosophical treatise;  it is at times raw and inchoate, both sketchy and profound.<br />As truly revolutionary postulate should, &quot;The Structure&quot;  left a deep sense of unease among large part of its  audience - science historians, philosophers and scientists  in general. It brutally cut the cords of continuity,  the view of the science development as &quot;growing tree in  a garden&quot;, or pure pursuit of ever more detailed and  sublimated &quot;truth&quot;. It shattered the textbook history of  science - a telescopic view that starts with the present  knowledge and traces earlier discoveries as gradual  approximation of today's picture. But as T. Kuhn argues it  never was a smooth continuous process. One could only  imagine what a world-shattering impact had a realization  that geo-centric Ptolemy model is wrong and Earth is just  one of the planets circling the Sun. The emerging Copernicus  system was not just a new mechanical model describing Solar  system. It was about completely changed worldview,  reverberationg through philosophical, religious and  political strife, not just scientific discussions. Together  with later additions, like the discovery that the Solar  system is itself not unique but an ordinary one among  miriad of similar stars, it is not surprising that the  ensuing turmoil will involve public burning of J. Bruno  and persecution of G. Galilei. There is simply now way  discoveries of such scope could be accepted smoothly by  the establishment of that time (or any other times).<br />Kuhn was often criticised by people unhappy with the  notion that scientific discovery is a process consisting  of two radically different categories: the gradual  &quot;puzzle-solving&quot; within well-defined and limited scope  of a present paradigm, and occasional &quot;revolutions&quot; -  periods of transformations so profound that new  worldview not just subsumes the previous one, but  throws it out altogether. However a different question  can legitimately be posed - how can it be otherwise?  The &quot;paradigm&quot; - as a collection of widely shared  scientific knowledge - is neither simply a fleeting  fashion or fad, nor purely rational and objective  collective knowledge which instantly reacts to new  facts and discoveries and flexibly adjusts to these  changes. There are enormous institutional resources<br />invested in preserving, perpetuating and developing  a &quot;paragidm&quot; - the huge educational and academic  establishment of a modern society, careers and  reputations of millions of scientists and thousands  of labs and universities.<br />Moreover, the paradigm-preserving &quot;normal science&quot; is  not necessarily a progress-handicapping factor. While  many critics concentrated on the limiting, restrictive  role of a scientific paradigm, it also has very important  enabling role, also mentioned by Kuhn. A paradigm provides  a solid foundation upon which further development is  facilitated. It is a language that enables communication  and understanding between researchers. Without a widely  shared and tacitly assumed concept a scientific paper  would spend most of its space just to explain and argue  basic premises of the research topic, or refute basic  assumptions of other works. Although Kuhn's notion of  &quot;normal science&quot; as &quot;puzzle-solving&quot; activity sounds  denigrating to some, in reality it can be hugely productive,  creative and challenging occupation.<br />This is related to yet another point of criticism of Kuhn's  work - whether a crisis in established paradigm is necessary  for a scientific revolution. Presumably, if one can come up  with a new theory explaining facts and observations better  than old one, it would be enthusiastically accepted and  triumph over the older one. Kuhn himself in the book's  postscript seemed to be willing to backpedal on this issue:  &quot;Nothing important to my argument depends, however, on crises  being an absolute prerequisite to revolutions&quot;. I think the  author is too shy here to defend his thesis. Revolutions are  extraordinary hard feats to accomplish.<br />Discovery is a very hard process, even within the scope  of a paradigm, which provides at least some guidance for  expectations, some sense of results which are often difficult  to interpret. When encountering unexpected results, a  scientist is presented by many possibilities, all of which  need careful examinations. Is it an error of experiment  (or computer code), impurity of materials, inaccuracy  of measurements, influence of external factors difficult  to account for? Or is is truly novel phenomenon which  requires a new theoretical foundation? The latter happens  much rarer than all the former possibilities. Often  scientists tend to downplay their own unexpected results  as errors, and only when becoming aware of similar results  by other colleagues begin to take them seriously.  An established paradigm persists not simply because  of conservatism and backwardness of scientific community,  but because true revolutions are rare, while errors,  ambiguities, and outright quackery are far more frequent  (Cold Fusion, anyone?). When a significant anomaly is  repeated more than once, and the evidence for it became  credible enough, a process of radical revision of existing<br />paradigm commences; and (on rare occasions) eventually  revolution happens, quickly and disruptively.<br />One last point. Some opponents (in particular Steve Fuller)  criticised Kuhn for, among other things, being an advocate  for establishment, as it gave legitimacy to a single dominant  paradigm at any given time (except rare periods of revolutionary  mess). He viewed Kuhn to a large extent as a product of the  Cold War-era statism of the 50's, with science dominated by  huge government and military programs. The irony here is that  the view of history as a process of gradual quantitative  changes punctuated by sudden qualitative leaps (revolutions)  is much closer to Hegelian-Marxist &quot;dialectic materialism&quot; -  the official philosophical doctrine of the Soviet Union, on  the opposite side of the Cold War struggle.denigrating to some, in reality it can be hugely productive,  creative and challenging occupation.  <br />This is related to yet another point of criticism of Kuhn's  work - whether a crisis in established paradigm is necessary  for a scientific revolution.

Let's admit it, most of the books crowding business sections of large bookstores are nearly trash. If they serve any purpose at  all, it is mainly to supply upper- and middle management with a lexicon of faddish buzzwords for reports, presentations and conference calls; in a few years nobody will remember most of these buzzwords and bullet points.   &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; is a rare exception. It does present a new paradigm of how technological innovations actually develop  and win over the previous technologies. Many reviewers pointed out key organizational aspects of the &quot;Innovator's Dilemma&quot; - &quot;how great companies fail by doing everything right&quot;. I will not repeat them. Instead I will concentrate on the important and  overlooked technical side of the issue.<br />One of the key concepts in the studies of the technological progress that emerged over the last decades is the so-called S-curves. They are usually depicted as a cascade of similar shaped curves, ascending in upper-right directions in a system of coordinates describing the performance of each new technology vs. time. According to this concept, as a new technology  emerges, its performance is at first much below than the established one. As it develops, its improvement ran for a while roughly in parallel to the established technology and below it. Then, as the older technology matures, its performance  improvement becomes slower and saturated (the upper end of the S-curve), and eventually is overcome by the new technology. Then the cycle repeats itself with yet another disruption.<br />&quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; in fact proposes a radical revision of this concept. New technology usually wins not because the old one exhausts its potential, but because continued improvement  in the performance of old technology becomes progressively less important and valuable, what the author calls &quot;technology oversupply&quot;. Instead of the S-curves Clayton Cristensen  presents what I'd call a &quot;#-pattern&quot;, although he doesn't use this term. The #-pattern consists of two pairs of parallel lines, both inclined in the upper-right direction, but at  different angles. The steeper pair of lines represents the &quot;technology trajectory&quot;, of which the upper line stands for the established technology, and the lower line - the new,  disruptive one. They run roughly in parallel, so that at all times the performance of the established technology is superior to the new one. The reason why the new technology triumphs  nevertheless can be understood from the second - less steep - pair of lines which represents the market demand at the lower and upper ends. Initially the trajectory of the disruptive  technology establishes a beachhead by meeting low-end market demands (intersecting the lower of the near-horizontal lines of the #-pattern). Then, while both established and disruptive  technologies improve faster than the market demand, the disruptive one is capable of satisfying all segments of the market. At the same time at is typically much better by other  criteria - e.g. cheaper, smaller, more reliable than the old one. Eventually the old technology is driven out completely.<br />The problem for the established technology arises not because the a disruptive technology quickly overcomes it in terms of the existing metrics, but the metrics itself changes. For example, 8-inch disk drives could still pack far more megabytes than 5-inch drives in the early 80's. But the new emerging products - PCs - could not yet absorb all the megabytes allowed by the 8-inch drives. The size and the price was more important for them - that is why the 5-inch drives won.<br />The fact that the established technology continues to hold an edge vs. the disruptive one helps explain why it is so difficult  for dominant companies to perform a successful transition, even as they are often first to discover new technology. They see that their current products arefar from exhausting their potential for improvement, and their customers continue to demand them. They often happy to relinguish the unappealing lower end of the market to the struggling upstarts, which seem  a very long way from being credible challengers. And eventually they lose.<br />I think that this is a very important thesis, and it is  consistently presented and well-explained throughout the book. I was dissapointed to see most of the book reviewers either overlooking it or completely misunderstanding this crucial point. Kudos to C. Christensen for putting forward an  original, innovative and convincing concept.	2000-10-17

First, we had &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; by  Tom Brokaw. Now David Brooks is fishing for a  juiciest piece of potential market penetration  - the upper quarter (income-wise) of the boomer  generation, the biggest demographic bulge  ever. His main unspoken refrain is that a  sole purpose of four billion years of the  Earth's evolutionary history was to produce  the Bobo class - the most purrrfect, most  wonderful elite that ever existed.<br />A bizarre feeling persistent while reading  this book is the combination of the most  shameless pandering with semi-ironic style,  amplified by the book cover jacket,  remininiscent of Henry Roussea half-primitivist,  half-ironic paintings, sort of a crossover of  &quot;The Dream&quot; and &quot;The Muse&quot;. I later realized  that this is all very purposeful - adding a  grain of salt to a dish which otherwise would  be harder to swallow with a straight face, but  now leveraging the flattery effect to the maximum.<br />Just how great today's Bobo upper class is? Unlike the previous WASP elite carefully grown  from the rigid matrix of the existing social  structure, the Bobo generation was born out of  combination of post-war affluence and expansion  of college education with anti-war protests and  various alternative movements of the 60's.  Their parents were from a generation scarred by  war (although they've seen only a small fraction  of hardship and horrors of their contemporaries  from Europe and parts of Asia). For them the post- war stable, conformist world of Norman Rockwell  and &quot;Father knows best&quot; was normal and acceptable.  But for their spoiled teenage children, taking  peace and affluence for granted, it was corrupt,  repressive, and soon to be exploded in hippie  movement, drugs and anti-war demonstrations.<br />It is clear by now that deep down a significant  part ofthe protest movement was not due to  deeply ingrained convictions, but out of simpler  reasons, like cowardice and opportunism. While some of their contemporaries fought and   bled there, young Bobos were certainly right  about fearing to be thrown into deadly swamps  of South-East Asia. Because VietCong would have  surely mince their tender rumps into pulp and  send them squealing all the way back to the TV  dinners in mommy's living room from  which they escaped to Berkeley halls, free love  and protesting crowds. To the same people who  burned draft cards and chanted &quot;Hey, hey, LBJ,  how many kids have you killed today?&quot; during  60's, it is perfectly fine 30 years later to  pontificate on pundit shows whether Serbia should  be bombed into 19th century, medieval or stone  edge - their own lives and 401K accounts are not  at risk there. The same people who fancied  themselves the most open-minded and liberated  generation in history, now became control freaks  and crusaders for nanny state, designing  soft but stifling restrictions and curfews on  their own teenage children. For example, they  didn't invent but fully support a moronic idea  that one can't have a bottle of beer until 21 -  years after one can drive a car, vote, marry and  serve and die in the army!<br />After lovingly describing in so much details  Bobo's earth-tone furniture with artificially  designed wear and tear, Andean trinkets and <br />African masks splattered all over their houses,  their gas-hogging SUV and big shower stalls, the  D. Brooks attempts to add more substance to  his picture. A chapter of the book &quot;How to be  an intellectual giant&quot; is devoted mainly to  today's punditry culture. After cutting through  some fluff, the author's basic idea is that  success has nothing to do with substance,  intellectual rigour or originality. It is all  about strategically positioning one's own  mediocrity relative to surrounding mediocrities.  One should run with the crowd, but not exactly  in the center of the crowd; sing the same tune,  but a half-tone higher or lower than the next  guy, and so on. Not that this was very different  in other times and places, but rarely such  obvious opportunism received such a cheerleading  as in David Brooks &quot;Bobos&quot;.<br />It goes downhill from there, when the author  predictably tries to spice up the book with  description of the sexual practices of &quot;Bobos&quot;, in particular S&amp;M and leather fetish clubs.  Brrrr! What could be a greater turn-off than  to imagine their middle-aged sagging bodies  desperately searching for artificial thrills  in a room full of &quot;Play Safe, Play Responsible&quot;  posters, after signing the 10-page liability  waiver? It would make a morose wife-swapping  game scene from &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; look like a  pinnacle of erotica! Yes, these people deserve  to be whipped hard - not during a S&amp;M game, but <br />for making sex so dreadfully boring, as erotic  as obligatory calorie-burning sweating in a gym.<br />Not all bad books are alike. Some are simply  annoying, that you want to put them down after  ten pages. This is not the case with &quot;Bobos&quot;.  The book is actually an enjoyable reading. It  really feels good once you realized that you  don't have to learn the names of bobotically- correct furniture shops and worry youself with  &quot;status-income disequilibrium syndrome&quot;. It  feels even better to have a good laugh at all  these narcissistic characters, their pathetic  &quot;syndromes&quot; and the writers worshiping their  silliest pretensions. Life is not so bad after  all.	2000-10-09

Normally I feel almost automatic scepticism  when encountering new theories that claim to  completely trasform currently accepted views  and conventional wisdom on a subject. Usually  they fall far short of that. But this &quot;Catastrophe&quot;  of David Keys is a rare exception. Not that I  agree with everything the author claims, but it  is well-argued, well-researched and very readable  and interesting study.<br />The period around the first half of the 6-th <br />century A.D. is usually relegated to obscurity  (with a few exceptions like the king Arthur  mythology). For example, the standard edition of  the classic Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the  Roman Empire&quot; gives several chapters describing  that period only in 1-page summaries, without  mentioning anything resembling the events of  the &quot;Catastrophe&quot;. But something very important  indeed happened around the year 535, although  precisely how important will likely to be the <br />subject of a scientific debate following D. Keys  thesis.<br />One of the drawbacks of the book, in my opinion,  is author's attempt to describe the impact of the  &quot;Catastrophe&quot; everywhere, which is sometimes  repetitive and not always convincing, rather than  concentrate on the regions and civilisations where  the influence of the 535 A.D. climate event was  the most crucial. To have a great impact on the  world history, an event does not have to completely  change everything in absolutely every corner of  the globe, as the author painstakingly tries to  prove.<br />It would be more illuminating to make a &quot;what if?&quot;  analysis, to compare the outcome of the 535 A.D.  event to what could have happened without it. Had  the &quot;Catastrope&quot; completely changed the course of  history, or had it only accelerated the trends  which were already in the making (decline of the  Roman Empire, emergence of Islam, etc), and cut  short some blind alleys? The book does not persue  &quot;what if&quot; analysis, argues mostly for the first  alternative, and offers very little on the second  possibility. However the author could hardly be  blamed for it. He is staking a claim by his thesis  of the crucial role a 535 A.D. event, which is yet  to be accepted (or not) by the scientific community  and general readers. Naturally he wants to present  this claims in volume and in dramatic fashion,  rather than argue over some finer points. <br />Author presents a rich and impresive collection  of tree growth and temperature measurements to  substantiate his analysis. But there are some  questions arising. In some graphs the temperature  and tree growth drop is most severe in 539 or 540, several years after the event, rather than its  immediate aftermath. On some graphs a sharp drop  of temperature around 535 looks in fact like a  reversal to normal after increase in previous years.  More detailed explanations and studies are due.  There are other contradictions. For example, the  geopolitical changes in the Eastern Mediterranean,  in particular the invasion of Avars and later  Turks, were the result of the dramatic weakening  of the Roman Empire - in large part because of  the plague and other consequences of the  &quot;Catastrophe&quot;. On the other hand, in Spain the  emergence of the &quot;modern world&quot; (in that case  the triumph of Catholic Christianity) was in  fact due to the residual *strength* of the Roman  Empire - as it was able to reconquer it from  Goths. <br />Overall, however,  it is a great reading for  anybody interested in history or in natural  catastrophes, even if one disagrees with author's  interpretation.	2000-10-05

One can't get  much blah-blahnder than that -  seemingly playing along the book's  irreverence  and channeling it into safe acceptable notions.<br />Following  any standards is not what authors had  in mind. Among their goals - if any  - they  proclaim &quot;... is protecting Russia from going the  way of  Prague. From becoming a domesticated,  obedient member of the Global  Village&quot;.<br />One of the more astute observations in &quot;The  Exile&quot; is about Moscow numerous &quot;expats&quot; community, for  which the authors readily have inexhaustible amount of scorn and derision.  By the early '90-s there wasn't a shortage of Westerners, particularly  Americans, plodding Moscow streets. Romantic idealists, careerists wishing  to nail a fashionable piece of &quot;emerging markets&quot; on their  resumes, fly-by-night sleazebags and crooks, hopeless losers of various  sorts trying to make it &quot;on the new frontier&quot; and then running  back, tail between the legs, and writing ridiculous &quot;revelations&quot;  like &quot;Moscow Madness&quot;. One of the most conspicuous crowds were  the hordes of Western young MBA consultants and advisers, the likes of what  is known as &quot;Andersen androids&quot; and similar telling nicknames. It  was a peculiar bunch. They mostly stuffed &quot;...publicly funded  businesses and organizations that were guaranteed profits, independent of  any competition or accountability of performance, while supposedly  furthering the capitalist values of competition and fair play... Looking at  their bright, happy faces, you'd never guess that these were the people  who'd have the balls to tell millions of Russians that their jobs and  benefits needed to be sacrificed for the sake of  'competitiveness'.&quot;<br />The book goes a long way to explain why reports  of western correspondents from Russia often feel like stale bottled water  taken from the same puddle, chlorinated and carbonated and slapped with a  familiar label. In short - because mostly these expat reporters are indeed  a closeted inward-looking insipid crowd, less interested in understanding  and accepting a new country than in fitting and truncating new reality to  familiar forms - and making a career out of it. Ironically, the  &quot;official&quot; pedantic expatriate outlet &quot;Moscow Times&quot;,  hilariously scewered all over this book, came out with not one, but two  reviews, both patiently explaining why &quot;The Exile&quot;, while so  blah-blah irreverent and provocative, is not such a big deal and perhaps  should not be taken too seriously.<br />&quot;The Exile&quot; unashamedly (and  exploitively) revels  in Moscow bursting sexuality, so missing in US,  either from real city streets or from plastic-looking flesh and toothy  smiles of innumerable &quot;sexy&quot; TV shows. Of course, the book is far  from flawless. Some of author's pranks are sophomoric (but others are  excellent), there are factual errors and some of its political insights are  laughable. But to nitpick on the book for this is to completely miss its  point. More likely the real bummer - they still don't get the word  &quot;dinamit`&quot;, as when one's party (repeatedly)  skips a date -  until one gets the point. The word<br />originates from &quot;dynamics&quot;,  with at least a hint of a game - chase and rejection, rather than  &quot;dynamite&quot; as in &quot;blow up something&quot;. What a bunch of  dopes.<br />Despite enjoying this book as no else I've  read recently, I won't  give it full 5-star  clip. That would smack of a kissassination  job of the  likes the authors so gloriously  trashed in their book. But I'll keep  reading  &quot;eXile&quot; to feed on its visceral, shameless  energy and  mockery of things safe and proper.rashed in their book.

Duh, what's the  alternative? That new trends are secretly broadcast into consumer's  cortexes from some corporate Dr. Evil's central repositiory? Or downloaded  after stumbling into some banner ads &quot;Click here for the next hot  idea&quot;? In other words, Mr. Gladwell's thesis makes sense, but it is  not particularly new or non-obvious.<br />The author's point is further  expanded, among other things, into three attributes which are important in  sustaining a successful &quot;epidemics&quot;. They are called the  &quot;Law of the Few&quot;, the &quot;Stickiness Factor&quot; and the  &quot;Power of Context&quot;. In fact (this is mine, not Mr. Gladwell's  illustartion) one can easily  understand these concepts in terms of massive  forest fires - like those near Los Alamos which made the news recently.  &quot;The Law of the Few&quot; is in fact a statement that some trees (e.g.  higher, dryer, with wide spreading branches) are more effective in  propagating the fire than others, just as some people are better at  disseminating new trends and ideas than others. The &quot;Stickiness  Factor&quot; is that the forest areas with denser amount of dry biomass are  likely to be more effective in sustaining massive fires, than thin grass or  underbrush, which often burns out and fizzle very quickly. The &quot;Power  of Context&quot; is  equivalent to a notion that ambient factors (e.g.   wind, humidity) are important in spreading the  &quot;epidemics&quot; of a  forest fire.<br />Is it correct? Yes, but it is also little more than a fairly  trivial, common-sense observation. Is it worth writing a book and conjuring  special catch-phrases? Probably yes, given Mr. Gladwell writing skill and  knack for astute real-world observations, but only marginally so.<br />The  idea of &quot;tipping point&quot; is illustrated by the  notion of  exponential growth,with slow change before the &quot;tipping point&quot;  and rapid acceleration afterwards. But the author doesn't seem to fully  understand exponential curve from a quantitative point of view. The thing  is, exponential growth does not have any special &quot;tipping point&quot;  at all. The essence of it is the same percentage of change in the same time  intervals, therefore each point is the same as any other; each section of  the curve, properly scaled, looks similar. In fact fact, one can consider  quantitative arguments on somewhat more substantial ground. For example,  define a &quot;tipping point&quot; as a  moment when the growth passes the  point of being  susceptable to inevitable fluctuations and extinction, that  is when initial flickering light becoming stealily expanding raging fire.  The author, however, does go into such direction. <br />Which is not to say  that the book is bad. It is easy, pleasant reading, with interesting real  world examples - although, for a fairly short book, it told me more about  Hush Puppies than I really cared to know.	2000-06-22
US	49565153	R3VZ0ADQ4EUINX	0316294748	555280414	Red Mafiya:  How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America	Books	1	31	59	N	N	Red Mafiya : How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America	After 40 years of the Cold War propaganda, the &quot;Red menace&quot; is still apparently a useful brand name, holding a treasure trove for all kinds of exploitation and &quot;sensational revelations&quot;. This is the  main impression I've got from reading Robert Friedman's book.<br />Nowhere the  author is even trying to pretend to  distinguish criminals from the rest of  the immigrants and visitors from the former USSR, or Russians in general.  For him all Russian are thugs, who came here &quot;not to achieve the  American dream, but to steal it&quot;. Never mind that most of alleged  mobsters he describes are not even ethnic Russians - most of his characters  are Jewish emigrants from Odessa - a port city in Ukraine, some are from  other Eastern European countries. <br />Not that the organized crime in the US  Russian community doesn't exist. Like any organized crime in general,  ethnic or not, it is deserved to be studied, written about and persecuted.  However an objective study and assessment of this phenomenon Mr. Friedman  book is not. Instead, it is a wholesale slander, boarding on most vicious  racist rhetorics and peppered with some of the  silliest stereotypes and  urban legends, like the  description of mobster who is constantly chewing  on a lead bullet from his gun before using it on his next victim.<br />We are  supposed to believe that the characters in his book are simultaneously  &quot;the world's most dangerous criminals&quot; and semi-literate  low-lifers with terrible table manners, with &quot;gaudy&quot;,  &quot;garish&quot;, &quot;tasteless&quot; and &quot;brutish&quot;, used  inseparably with anything related to Russian community and culture.<br />The  obvious contradiction is a thick web of global criminal conspiracies of  &quot;Red Mafia&quot; painted by the author, and a meager picking in actual  facts related to Russian organized crime - with just a handful of  convictions on murder, racketeering or financial fraud charges. Here in  Boston, for example, I don't remember a single headline story related  specifically to Russian  criminal involvement, although multi-victim  shootouts among more traditional Italian, Irish, black or asian mobs still  occur every now and then.<br />In fact, majority of Russian emigrants are  professionals who quickly find plenty of opportunities among America's most  dynamic economic sectors. I haven't seen even a  fairly small high-tech  company without engineering talent from the former Soviet Union, or a  department of a leading university without significant Russian presence  among professors, post-docs or graduate students. On weekends one can more  likely hear Russian spoken in theater districts, on ski slopes or tennis  courts, rather than in some sleazy dives or gaudy watering  holes like  those in R. Friedman book. <br />What is lacking in objective statistics and  solid facts is amply compensated in insinuations. Every wiff of allegation,  tabloid fantasy, or rant of a depressed detective with racist Mark  Furman-like inclination, becomes unquestionable truth in Mr. Friedman book.  For example, if a known intellectual or scientist was spotted in a  restaurant not far from some alleged mobster, it is immediately concluded  that he is a part of a sinister criminal network &quot;employing hundreds  of  scientists with Ph.D., mathematicians and engineers&quot;. <br />R.  Friedman attempts to picture himself as a fearless fighter against a global  criminal &quot;red mafia&quot; empire. Among the author's claims to fame is  a sophomoric, poorly written &quot;death threat&quot; from a convicted thug  Ivankov, laden with obscenities and spelling errors and proudly displayed  among book's photo inserts. <br />One of the book's central pieces is a  &quot;sensational&quot; story about a former Soviet submarine allegedly to  be sold to a Colombian drug lord by Russian mob. It has apparently a big  symbolic significance for the author. Just imagine what those evil Russiansare up  to - the same submarines which threatened US with nuclear missiles,  now are about to unleash hundreds of tons of heroin on American cities.  This story makes a good material for a trashy tabloid but very little  practical sense, even if some mobsters did boast about subs in their  arsenal after too much vodka or tequilla. A large  submarine is a terrible  choice for transporting drugs. It is expremely difficult to operate and  repair, especially if one wants to remain clandestine. Moreover, since the  Cold War era USA maintains a huge network of acoustic locators designed to  spot such submarines, which makes its movement much easier to trace than  that of hundreds of thousands of yachts and motorboats and tens of  thousands of private planes of the Caribbean region, among which the  drug-traders vehicles freely mingle.<br />Just as laughable are the author's  excursions in financial matters. He claims that upward of 80 billion  dollars in cash was transported by mob in sacks aboard Delta NY-Moscow  flights, with tacit approval of US Treasury and Federal Reserve (allegedly  for the purpose of stabilising rouble). Of course, this is preposterous.  The closest thing to such a scheme were talks   between US, IMF and Russian  government in mid-90 of a special fund or a credit line for rouble  stabilization in the amount of about 5 billion dollars. Eventually nothing  came out of it.  Total amount of cash dollars in Russia is estimated at  30-40 billions, only small part of it is in active circulation. <br />The  style of Mr. Friedman's is repetitive and confusing. An average reader will  be quickly drowned in a disjointed mumbo-jumbo of names, places, dates and  connections. A specialist on Russia, emigration, or ethic crime in general  wouldn't likely find much of value in this book  either, as all kinds of  flimsy factoids and allegations are thrown together without references to  sources or even rudimentary assessments of their validity.	2000-05-15
