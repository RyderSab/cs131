The story was never dull and was very difficult to put down.  Between readings, I did lend it to a friend who absolutely hated it and had a hard time getting through it.  She said it reminded her too much of a prominent Massachusetts family.  I had just thought it was an exceptionally good fiction novel.  Upon the second reading, I also saw the similarities to the family but still enjoyed the book and believe the author got his point across.	2005-08-16

It was set in 1960s Boston which I found to be interesting.  The plot was somewhat predictable and the writing style provided enjoyable reading.  I would like to read another book by John Flood to determine why I wasn't overjoyed with the book.  I believe it may have been because of the characters.  There were police, doctors, lawyers, priests and spouses and none of them were likable.  All the characters were shady and dishonest and it was impossible to find any integrity.	2005-04-29
