He supports each of his assertions about Druidic beliefs and practices with citations from ancient sources and from archeology, and lays it all out in an outline that allows students to get started immediately with a Druidic spirituality.<br /><br />Far from being duotheistic, the book gives advice for constructing your Druidic pantheon of worship based on the realities of the local land, and the spirits proper to each individual worshipper.<br /><br />From there, he presents a full system of Druidic ritual, as used in Ar nDraiocht Fein - about as far from a Wiccan form as one could get. It involves offering to the Gods & Spirits, divining their blessing, and then receiving that blessing. Ellison gives solitary rituals for each of the Celtic holy days (and for the solstices and equinoxes), as well as ideas for Druidic funderal and wedding rites.<br /><br />There is a section on spells and practical magic as well, and the book ends with a listing of every Druidic group and order of any size at all.<br /><br />This is a valuable resource - one of the very first books on Druidry drawn from a non-wiccan, scholarly perspective, adapted to practical use. Highly recommended.	2005-09-27

The book is written with a moderately reconstructionist sensibility that helps break down modern misunderstandings of Celtic lore, but it maintains a friendly and instructive voice that doesn't put the reader off.

That said, there are a few not-terrible Christian critiques of Wiccan ideas out there. This book is terrible. <br /> <br />While the author makes some effort to provide accurate information about wiccan and satanist ideas and practices, he has plainly failed to understand the material. He consistently confuses satanic with wiccan ideas and his grasp of the history of Paganism, Witchcraft and modern occultism are laughably confused.  <br /> <br />Just as an example of his confusion, he seems to think that HP Lovecraft's 'Necronomicon' had some sort of existence in traditional occultism! <br /> <br />The worst part of the book is the pointless attempt at fiction that takes up about half it's pages. The tale of a group of teens and their encounter with witchcraft is worthy of the worst sort of hollywood screenwriting, bearing no resemblance to anything that happens in the real world, in either wicca or in satanism. <br /> <br />This is tripe. <br /> <br />Ian	2004-12-30

This book takes the known scholastic sources concerning the ogham, and lays the information out in a clear and orderly way.<br />The book begins by presenting the alphabet letter-by-letter, with correspondences for each, and with the commentary and meanings provided from actual Irish sources. It then presents the many different variants of the ogham found in the book of ballymote. Finally, it provides some starting-point ideas about using the ogham for divination and magic, and some useful appendices, including a ready-to-copy set of ogham disks.<br />Anyone who wants to get a solid understanding of the facts about this mysterious Celtic alphabet should start with this book.	2004-04-09

He finds in traditional Taoist Paganism his first and most complete model. In Hinduism he has to choose among the many forms to find the (still fairly prominent) presence of Pagan ways. Having isolated the pagan remnants in those ways, he goes on to other world religions, including Japanese culture, European Catholicism and North American First Peoples. York makes fairly good use of material from the african world, including santeria, Lucumi, and the like.<br />After pointing out the Pagan ideas in the various world paths, he examines the neopagan movement, and reaches interesting conclusions.<br />I'd recommend this as a fine contribution to the development of Pagan theological thinking.	2004-04-03

With the right teacher(s), and plenty of additional reading material a student could be guided through the whole process of beginning to learn the magical arts.    Oberon has attempted a truly comprehensive introduction to the world of magic and Paganism, and he's done pretty well. I like the boy-scout manual feel of the book, mixing life skills, woodland skills and occult skills. He produces a kind of generalized, cross-tradition version of occult arts that I like well enough, though I think that some greater discussion of where the various ideas come from would have been good. The ideas tend to be presented as though they were simply a 'tradition of wizardry', with no real discussion of the fact that 'wizardry' is being concocted right here and now.     Each chapter is a good introduction to the topic presented. Some, such as the basic how-tos, could be implemented just as is, from the book. Other chapters will help to lead students toward wider resources on the topic.    My biggest concern is that the book almost entirely avoids a practical approach to religion. 'Wizardry' is presented as having plenty of commerce with the Gods and Goddesses, but there is no instruction at all on how to approach those powers, except in a ritual magic, 'energies to be used' sort of sense. Some instruction is given on the use of shrines, etc, and in the 8-fold year of Pagan worship, and the book does a fine job of avoiding any preference for one religious system over another. I do think a bit more attention could have been given to an introduction to Paganism as worship. The Potter books themselves, of course, strictly avoid any hint of religion, and I think that spirit has carried over into this work. Those who are interested in a religious approach to wizardry will have to supplement the Grimoire, but the book itself provides plenty of resources and places to begin.  Any small criticisms aside it's still as good a general intro to modern Pagan magic and 'wizardry' as has been done yet.	2004-04-03

Though it is written as though from Merlin's point of view, it is a basic retelling of some of the Merlin stories, followed by introductory material on basic modern occultism and magic.

While most reviews think of this as a 'vampire' book, I think it's a broader canvas than that - it includes medieval grimoire sorcery, tantric occultism, and a lot of cool real vampire lore that never gets covered in the popular literature. Those who like the occult theories of Kenneth Grant will be thrilled by the stuff in here.<BR>The book's greatest flaw is its ending, which wanders off into a full-scale tour of a halluncinatory hell without much rhyme or reason. This last section rather fails.<BR>Still if you want a tale of black magic to curl your toes, I recommend it. Sexually depraved? You bet! Lunatic? Possibly... Steeped in elder lore?

The author did her research at fests in the Midwest, mainly Pagan Spirit Gathering and Starwood, and obviously enjoyed herself.

This strange item is listed in the occult fiction stuff, but it doesn't even pretend to be fiction in fact. Instead it is the opinion and rambling of some unnamed occultist, who has decided to commit his every idea to writing. I found the material mildly amusing, with some good advice, some bad, and a number of plain errors of fact. The author seems to enjoy categorizing those he disapproves of as [people] and silly people, and while he may have some actual exerience in occult practice, he also seems strangely gullible about things like conspiracies. Probably nearly half the text is filled with quotes from other authors, including, oddly enough, the material from the Church of the Subgenius, which the author seems to take seriously!<BR>If you've already read widely in the occult, and you'd like a laugh, this book might be for you.	2002-09-07

Beginning with a very standard and cliched plot - the heroine must return to claim her accursed homestead - it is full of enough biblical and fundamental Christian perspective to make me wonder whether it was from a religious publisher. Yet it manages to be pretty creepy, and the ending is a real surprise, in my opinion, given the initial tenor of the tale. Decently written, kept me turning pages through it's simple plot with scary episodes. A step above ordinary cheesy horror.	2002-02-08

The author has led his Rowan Tree tradition of the craft for decades and has focused its work on personal spiritual growth. This book begins by assuming that the reader knows the basics of the Craft - the tools, the Rede, the Circle, etc. he outlines his system's curriculum, and provides some guidance for the solitary reader in using it.<BR>One of the more interesting bits is a borrowing from Tibetan Buddhism. In that system, powerful adepts recover their tools from life to life, as their new incarnations are discovered. The author proposes a similar system for Wicca, with athames, etc, passed from incarnation to incarnation over the generations.<BR>Good reading for those interested in higher-level thinking on the Craft.	2002-02-04

It is a farrago of half-understood and often misrepresented material,  lifted from both actual grimoires, and from the anti-magical works of the church. The author pretends that there are medieval 'black books' of diabolism - there are none. He presents material lifted from Gardnerian Witchcraft as part of 'satanic' ritual, and in general lies freely to his readers.

I'm a fan of both of these authors, but this book just takes too long to get to the point. The authors seem to feel a need to set up a detailed intellectual rationale for the existence of the 'astral' plane, and for human ability to work with it.

This book looks at the practice of 'seidr' - norse shamanic-style magic - both from a scholastic and a practitioner's viewpoints. But Blain is no mere participant-observer, she is anactive carrier of the modern Asatru tradition, and her efforts to explicate that tradition in ways that are useful to her academic discipline are fascinating.

So I was somewhat dissapointed on arrival. I do understand that these tiny-press Euro books cost a lot in the US...<br />AS to the content, it's pretty good. There is a minimum of self-congratulation about how much cooler the system is than more traditional methods, and a fairly close focus on actual practice. The author mixes and matches from cultures freely, now from Africa, now North America. he has managed, nevertheless, to compose a pretty coherent system, based primarily in the symbols that have come to be  associated with 'chaos' magic as a school. If you're interested in practical spell-work and magical power, with little regard for conservative occult ethics, this is a good book if you can afford it.	2002-01-14

However, I found the author's ideas on the topic to be rather shallow. I must say thatI found the whole issue of the 'gothic' subculture to be as irrelevant to the theology of Paganism as, say tie-die and flowers might be. Personal aesthetic choice does not, in my opinion, have much to do with spirituality, and the book spends far too much time defining and defending goth culture (to which I have no objections)for my taste. On the other hand, when it comes up against actual theological issues, such as the presence of pain and death in the world, the book seems to fall short of deep thought on these interesting matters.<br />All in all, an interesting first effort on a topic that deserves more thought - maybe, in the end, we can simply discard the ideas of 'light' and 'dark' as useful spiritual metaphors...	2001-12-01

It should be interesting to modern practitioners as well as to students of history and culture.<br />The book begins by examining the  meaning of the term 'magic', especially as related to the term 'religion'.  Beginning with the ways of the Magi, and its development through the  'mystery cults' and influences from Egypt, Persia and the Graeco-Egyptian  papyri, the author traces the growth and change of the idea of magic in  classical culture. <br />The book then considers the figure of the magician,  and the place of magical arts. It uses interesting classical sources,  including a well-documented trial for sorcery of a Roman scholar. Two  chapters address the rites if initiation of magicians, and the large body  of evidence for the use of curse tablets and images.<br />The book emphasizes  magic as a personal and individual approach to the spiritual, and how that  brought magicians under suspicion by religious authorities. It discusses  the development of the literary image of the mage.<br />I found the book to be  satisfyingly scholarly, yet well written and engaging.
