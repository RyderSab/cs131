Granted this book is short (note: 48 pages) and consists only of two stories. But they are new and they are good stories. Gaiman does what he does so well- weaves a tale so well that you're captivated until the end (no matter how long or short the story is). <br /> <br />If you're an avid reader of his online journal, you may recognize the black cat in the first story- which has a shocker near the end. I had a, \\"Whoaaa... No way, man\\" moment. And the second reads a lot like an old Grimm fairy tale- the kind that doesn't necessarily end \\"happily ever after\\" for everyone. And Zulli's artwork is wonderful in both stories. <br /> <br />I collect all of Gaiman's work, so this was a no brainer purchase for me. If you're new to his work, maybe try Murder Mysteries or Stardust or definitely the Sandman series first. You'll get hooked, I promise. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars strictly because it was so short. I wouldn't have minded waiting for a hardcover with at least five stories of the same length as these two. Because then the book would have lasted longer than half an hour!	2005-01-10

I don't understand why some people gave this book five stars. They must be very advanced knitters and didn't notice that some explanation and diagrams are missing.     I didn't like that the pictures are in black and white- Don't be fooled by the colored socks on the cover! It made it very hard to get a good look at the socks and see what Ms. Bordi did. And the only close-up is of the most advanced sock in the book- the Leaf and Tendril! How about some close-ups of the other socks? The most basic one would have been helpful! Like- picking up stitches along the heel flap or joining the heel with the instep so that there isn't a gaping hole on either ankle? Huh? Because, all you said was \\"You're going to twist this stitch around on the next round so that there's not a gaping hole.\\" And that's all you said about it. What- what is that even supposed to mean to me?    So you can see that the directions could be confusing as well- especially if you aren't too sure how to differentiate between any the following: gusset, instep, heel, heel flap. There's should be a diagram (like when you see the cuts of beef on a cow) showing the different areas of a sock.    And she tells you to finish off the sock by grafting the end. That's it. I have no idea what grafting is or entails, but she expects me to. What's up with that? This book could easily have been twice as thick, with better pictures and instructions and I would have given it 5 stars. As it is, you'll need plenty of other books to help you get through the most basic sock pattern in here.    Plus, she makes the same tired joke over and over again- \\"Eat rice & beans for a week so that you can buy more circular needles.\\" \\"Go make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich- you're saving for needles, remember?\\" \\"Stop eating- Buy needles.\\" \\"Sell you children- Buy More Needles.\\" She makes it sound like to buy needles is to forsake food/clothing/heat/etc.	2005-01-03

This is the first volume of What's Michael I've read- and now I'm intent on buying them all (starting at volume 1)! If you love cats and manga, this is for you. It is really, really, REALLY REALLY funny. The short stories (only a few pages each) are funny in and of themselves but it's the artwork that makes it great. Michael himself is hilarious, his cat-friends, the manner in which he's drawn, it's all fantastic. I devoured this paperback in about 20 minutes and had to bring it over to my sister for her to read. I sat next to her on the couch, cracking up all over again as she was reading and laughing. I've read and enoyed Nausicaa, Osamu Tezuka's work, countless other graphic novels and I'm thrilled to start adding the What's Michael series to my collection!	2004-09-28

Holden Carver is deep undercover, working for the bad guys. He's in SO deep that the only person who can substantiate his true involvement with the good guys is in a coma. So now he's stuck.<br />This is a world of good guys and bad guys; literally superheroes and villains. You don't see too much of the good guys because there's off rescuing sinking cities, etc. It's the bad guys who Holden is running with, which I find very interesting. I haven't read too many stories where the protagonist is a bad guy. They all have villainous names (e.g. Genocide, Miss Misery) and work for an even more sinister man named Tao.<br />This series really does have it all: espionage, superheroes, humor, excitement, sex. It's written extremely well and is not your little brother's comic, that's for sure. I completely recommend this series and if you don't like it, you're a moron.	2004-07-12

I'd read a review somewhere that this children's book is painfully formulaic: Main character sets off on an adventure, meets a new character every chapter, gets into some kind of trouble every chapter, gets out of said trouble every chapter, ends up facing bad-guy and finding out some truth about himself. Well, yeah; that's a pretty accurate description of the book only, you'd be missing all the wonderful (and original) characters he comes into contact with. I really enjoyed this book and honestly couldn't put it down. The types of people, places and plants are really fun. The drawings are especially good. I will say [QUASI-SPOILER ALERT] a side character died and I wholly wasn't expecting it. In fact, it really made me upset that a lovable new character was introduced only to die five pages later. Not cool.	2004-07-07

It was good. I liked it but didn't love it. This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. What made the first few so enjoyable (the simplicity of the story/characters/mysteries) suddenly felt dull to me in this installment. So I tossed to book aside with only about 50 pages left to finish, not really caring whether or not Mma Ramotswe got married or whether or not any of the cases got resolved. I did go back to it over the weekend simply because I was in dire need for something to read and couldn't figure out which book I wanted to crack into. In the end: Happy Botswana Ending. Was I expecting anything different? The next one in the series, Full Cupboard of Life, sounds just as exiting as the rest: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni installs a new seatbelt into Mma Ramotswe's van, Mma Makutsi's new house will have running water, everyone drinks a lot of bush tea. Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful storyteller but his books should be reserved for when you're coming out of a depression and want something simple and happy to read.	2004-07-07

In the end, I was pleasantly surprised with this book because it was so thoroughly realized. The story is taken directly from the Bible, describing what the Rapture would be like and Trials and Tribulations afterward. The Antichrist is rapidly coming into power. It's all very exciting. This book mostly deals with the disappearances and the week afterward. My sister saw me reading this book and asked, \\"Isn't that book, like, pseudo-religious or something?\\" Not pseudo. It IS religious and that might put some people off from reading it, but it shouldn't. Granted, the story does come off as preachy at times but the book (and series) is basically a novelized version of Revelations. It's still an exciting and interesting read. Now I've got to finish the whole series and, for fun, read &quot;Right Behind&quot; and &quot;Kiss My - - Left Behind&quot;.	2004-07-07

I think his writing is very funny, very touching and very entertaining. I go to see Sedaris speak when he's on tour and I read short pieces he's written for The New Yorker and Esquire online. In fact, I've already read many of the stories in this book (which was somewhat disappointing). &quot;Rooster at the Hitching Post&quot; and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you don't want to buy this book. I will say, though, there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it. Just don't be too surprised if you come across something you've read before.	2004-06-07

Auntie Mame herself is a character and a half. Her actions and the things that happen to her are truly entertaining to read. Also, I think it's nice to read stories that take you back in time: the 1920's to 1950's Manhattan in this case.<br />This wasn't a laugh out loud book for me but it was consistently amusing and made me chuckle. The characters are some of the most colorful I've ever read. Auntie Mame superficially appears to be self-centered but you see that she really cares about people and does the right thing (in her own manner). Also, for the time period in which the novel was written, she was extremely open-minded. <br />The chapters are easily digestable to read one each night in bed before going to sleep. I also like that each chapter opens up with the narrator talking about a an old (and unbelievable) lady in an article he's reading. This causes the narrator to reminisce about related story starring his Auntie Mame. In the end, the narrator stops the reminiscing and brings the story to the present. I thought this structure was well-crafted.	2004-03-08

I enjoy these types of novels, where companies are the bad-guys, but there was something substantial missing from this novel: depth.<br />Jennifer Government's relationship with her daughter is a dichotomy of \\"I'm here for you\\" and \\"I gotta go to the other side of the planet for work,\\" which she never seems to feel too remorseful about. The person she leaves in care of her daughter was someone she's only met twice. Business people make random decisions for seemingly no good reason. Side characters pop in and out of the story with no inner-development to explain their actions.<br />Jennifer is literally obsessed with catching John Nike. You know they must have history together for her to break official rules/orders, leave her daughter and recruit/blackmail people into helping her. Once you find out what the reason is in the end, though, it just doesn't seem convincing enough.<br />This was a nice, light read for 320 pages but I would have liked this book more if it was heartier: more information, more background, etc.<br />If you want to read another book along the same plotline, where advertising to the public and sales are number one, try The Savage Girl by Alex Shakar. I enjoyed that book more than this.	2004-03-08

It's worth mentioning that the cover Amazon is currently showing isn't the actual cover.<br />Not that the cover really matters. It's what's inside that counts and this is particularly true for Rex Mundi (Latin for \\"King of the World\\"). I was told by my comic seller that I absolutely must try this trade paperback out, which collects issues #0-5 together. He said it's about a Europe, France in particular, that might have been. There's no separation of Church and State, America is known as the Confederate States of America (after the Civil War ended in a stalemate) and \\"feudalism and colonialism are the only modes of political power in the world.\\" Sounds interesting, no?<br />The back of the trade paperback says that this is a quest for the Holy Grail as told as a murder/mystery. The comic itself is very noir in its design and story-telling. Faces are in shadows, all the important stuff happens in the nighttime and everyone seems to have a sinister undertone. It is a very exciting mystery.<br />An added bonus is that the faux-newspaper articles that were inserted into the original comics were *not* left out of this trade. The writer created made-up news stories from this time-that-could-have-been. It's fun to read, gives you a better understanding of the Rex Mundi world and it makes the graphic novel last a little longer.<br />This is one of those comics where I tried the trade paperback out and enjoyed it to much that I'm going to have to start collecting the individual comic books as they come out. If you don't like comic books (because of all the advertisements or whatever), you'll want the next trade paperback.<br />Note: I gave this 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I'm still not too sure what's going on in the story yet. I'm a little confused but that's because I don't quite understand all the nuances of the invented time period yet.	2004-02-09

I had a really difficult time with this book. It appears that D.B.C. Pierre watched and re-watched every single episode of Jerry Springer to come up with the colorful array of characters in Vernon God Little. All the women are obese and nobody is very smart. People say thing like, \\"Ol' Keeters down tha road done made-up summa that thar stuff-\\" and so on. It just seemed to me that the author was writing directly from a stereotype and was deliberately trying to be offensive 90% of the time. The difference between good offensive (ie. Henry Miller) and bad offensive (i.e. this book) is how much of what's being written is truthful as opposed to an author faking/forcing it. I wasn't too impressed.<br />Having said that, the tone of the novel changed dramatically half-way through the story: It looks as though Vernon Gregory Little is the one who's going to be taking all the heat for a recent shooting-spree at his school in Texas. Vernon flees to Mexico and by the time he's back home, nearly all of southern Texas' murders have been blamed on him.<br />While Vernon was in Mexico, story mellowed out a little and Pierre took his time to describe the country in wonderful detail. And, back home, when Vernon's in jail and on trial, his reflections are more profound. All of this was way better reading than the white-trash/empty scenario that is the first-half of Vernon God Little.<br />If you've got nothing else to read, by all means, pick this book up (just wait until paperback).	2004-01-26

Reality Bites, Singles, any John Hughes movies. There isn't too much going on in the plot department but it's a lot of fun to watch. This book is a lot of fun to read.<br />On the back cover of Box Office Poison by Alex Robinson, there's a quote that says this book is \\"completely voyeuristic. This is what it would be like to see your friends behind closed doors.\\" If you're a young, twenty-something trying to figure out what you want to do with your life and whether or not you'll ever find true love (or just get laid), this is the book for you.<br />Did you ever hate one of your friend's girlfriends? Feel like killing neighbors in your apartment building who don't know how to be quiet? Ice skate with a Costa Rican Olympic figure skater? Then you'll totally relate to the stories in here. This is a hefty graphic novel, over 600 pages (and the only other graphic novel I've seen that had rivaled this length is Craig Thompson's wonderful Blankets), but the story is broken up into chapters. I think this may have been a serial comic that was collected into a novel... I'm not sure. The book does go by fast, though.<br />Some parts are lighter than others, but there's a serious thread that holds everything together. An aging comic book artist who got gypped out of the rights to a wildly popular character and his journey for justice. The epilogue to this book is a lot more sedate than the rest of the stories and made reading this book completely and totally worth it.<br />I know it costs a lot, but it is worth it. It'll make a great addition to your graphic novel library.<br />If you would like to know more about Box Office Poison, check out the website:<BR>[...]	2003-12-23

Paolini has created a lush landscape and rich history. This is a good book for a first-time writer but it does lack a certain polish. Also, I did find myself thinking \\"This is too much like Lord of the Rings.\\" There are Elves and Dwarves but something different are the Dragon-riders and this is probably the most interesting part of the book.<br />Paolini spends a lot of time describing the intimate relationship the main character, Eragon, has with his dragon, Saphira. To some extent Eragon doesn't feel fully developed as a character. True, he's only 16-year-old and is still in the midst of developing but it's somewhat confusing for the reader. To be completely honest, the thing I liked most about the book was flipping to the map on the inside cover, following Eragon's travels.<br />This author can only get better with time. I'd be interested to read the next two in the trilogy. In the meantime, I highly recommend The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 1: The Amulet of Samarkand. I couldn't put this book down. It's original, funny and not that many people seem to know about it.	2003-12-01

You know when you read a book and after the first five pages you KNOW it's going to be awesome? That's what happened for me here. A small boy conjures a demon to steal an amulet. Little does the boy know what the amulet is worth.<br />Set in \\"another\\" London, where magic is a way of life for some people (the Prime Minister is a magician), this book focuses on Nathanial (the boy) and Bartimaeus (the demon). Where Nathanial is dark, vengeful and serious, Bartimaeus is dark, vengeful and funny. He doesn't take things too seriously and, hey, why should he when he's been around for thousands of years and will probably be around for thousand more?<br />It's hard with fantasy novels to describe imaginary things so that they're believable and so that the reader follows along. I had to no trouble with this book. The imps, the magic, the transformations, all of it was extremely entertaining and well played out. Bartimaeus even injects many footnotes into his narration and I didn't find unevenness in that.<br />All I can say is that I'm so glad this is going to be a trilogy. I cannot wait for the next one. Bartimaeus is a very funny demon and Stroud weaves an engrossing tale.	2003-12-01

This is the story of Lucy and the noises inside the walls of her house. She knows it's wolves, but when she tells each of her family members this, they obviously don't agree. They all have reasonable explanations but are soon surprised. I don't want to give more away because you should go out (buy it, borrow it from a friend, take it out from library) and experience THE WOLVES IN THE WALLS.<br />Gaiman has written a story so tight with tension, you're afraid it might snap. I'm 24-years-old and I read this book out loud to a 26 and 27-year-old. We all felt like we were 10 years old again. Also, the collage work Dave McKean did for WOLVES created the perfect mood. The pages use drawings, pictures, colorful swirly things. McKean is a very, very talented artist.<br />I highly recommend this beautiful and exciting story. If you haven't already, you should also check out a few other projects by the Gaiman/McKean team: The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish, Violent Cases and The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch.	2003-08-08

The plague seed arrives to her secluded village via bolts of cloth sent from London. As the residents begin to fall ill and die, one after the other, those that remain alive make the vow to remain in the village, because to flee would only spread the disease further.<br />This is a historical novel but it's not a dry, boring read. It's based on the true account of an English village that did impose a self-inflicted quarantine, but much has been invented to make for a more readable story. <br />Undeniably, Anna is made into a heroine as she goes to the rescue of her fellow villagers, delivering babies, tending to the sick, helping those that cannot help themselves. But Anna is also made human by a few rare emotional choices she makes. After losing her husband in an accident and losing the prospect of new love with another man, quiet Anna feels a sudden surge of jealousy at the love between the village rector and his wife. That they should have each other and she should be alone is too unfair; so she smashes every single dish she had close at hand. That was in 1666, but by today's standards, I would imagine this to be akin to pushing a car off a cliff just to watch it be destroyed. Her loss of control was a small passage in the book, merely a paragraph, but it brings Anna down from the saintly, iconic picture that she has been painted into throughout the whole story.<br />I've heard people say that they didn't enjoy the ending of this book. They thought the ending was too abrupt or a `cop out'. Yes, the book wrapped up quickly, but it wasn't \\"...and then she woke up. The End.\\" This book was following Anna and it went where she went. It could have continued on, covering the aftermath of the plague and all that entails, but then the book would have been 10 volumes long. <br />I call this book &quot;Lite Historic Reading&quot;. If you want something more substantial, pick up Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose or Iain Pears' An Instance of the Fingerpost. Both are extremely long, erudite, satisfying works of fiction that one could write their Master's thesis on. The Year of Wonders is a good book to read during a rainy weekend.	2003-07-29

Botswana lady sleuth Mma (pronounced \\"mee-muh\\" in my head, but represents your standard gender term for a female) Ramotswe solves local Botswana crimes: family problems, fraud, kidnappings and disappearances. What makes this book so readable (for me) is that the \\"crimes\\" are rather mundane compared to what we see on the 5 o'clock news. This is a welcome change when one has grown tired of all those mystery novels out there that start with a dead prostitute lying face down in a city gutter and the ubiquitous hard-boiled detective spouting hardened prose like, \\"In a city like this, you wake up everyday wishing you were dead\\". This book is also worth a read as the story is peppered with local images/cultural idiosyncrasies that one might not know about Africa and, more specifically, Botswana.	2003-07-28

I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a comic book representation of the gothic response to banal reality or simply a [bad] made-up story. I found it fragmented and directionless in the beginning, but that's not uncommon when you're creating a new series from scratch.<br />Gloomcookie starts with a teeny, tiny goth girl named Lex and her dysfunctional relationship with another goth named Max. They go to goth clubs with their goth friends and behave in a very tragic-goth manner. Slowly, a story emerges through flashbacks, fantasies and dreams. It's not a bad story at all, it just feels kind of rough.<br />Overall, the story was only okay, but does hold a lot of potential. I plan on trying vol. 2.	2003-07-28

This one was not nearly as good. The first book was about the only female werewolf, Elena Michaels, and her dealings with The Pack (a mini-society of werewolves living in upstate New York) which was very interesting and well written. Armstrong gave Elena a strength and a viciousness that was pleasing to read.<br />In Stolen, Armstrong tries to make a grander, more exciting story and only succeeds in making a muddled, less believable story. Here, Elena's kidnapped (were-napped?) and locked in a secret underground lair with a witch, half-demon, voodoo priest and shaman who are all there because a Bill Gates type maniac wants to hunt them down and shoot them because he likes virtual shooting games so much that he has to have the real thing and, luckily, has the cash to make it happen...

Satrapi writes about and draws her adolescence in Iran during the country's periods of the revolution and war. She also allows us to see how she was feeling at those times (mostly, it seems, she was feeling rebellious).<br />She tells us what it's like for females to suddenly be forced to wear a veil when outside their homes. She covers some of her own amazing family history (her great-grandfather was Iran's last emperor). She also talks of Iran's war with Iraq in the early 80's and it's only too relevant to our current events. What's more, she's funny. Watching &quot;Marji&quot; as a little girl in the book, re-acting to situations as only a little girl would, you're able to sympathize, if not empathize.<br />I saw Satrapi speak at this year's Book Expo America and I walked away with a with a feeling that this woman is part artist, part rebel, part humanitarian and part historian. She's also very very funny. When asked whether or not she's want a movie based on her memoir, she said [heavy French accent], &quot;No, I don't think so. I think they would make it too much like 'Never Without my Daughter'.&quot; Right now, she's working on a sequel to Persepolis.<br />You should read this.	2003-06-27
US	43893683	RXP76SQOLDVQ8	1550225278	354849169	The Harmon Chronicles: Caillou, Fun all day	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Mostly fluff, pretty funny.	The stories and experiences are funny, but not \\"I'm peeing my pants\\" funny. Harmon Leon has got guts to do everything he's written about, and that's impressive, but I felt as though half of the stories left me a little unsatisfied. It was worth him writing about how a gun can (and will) be sold to any lunatic off the street, but there's another report about him and his girlfriend renting a plane, so that they can get busy in it. I mean, c'mon, what's the point (other than the fact you like telling people you're part of the mile high club)? Checking out the Hare Krishnas, Jews for Jesus and Scientology religions was interesting, but faking personalities and trying to rent a room? I want my reading to be intelligent AND hilarious. This book was both, but often not at the same time.<br />Bottom Line: Pretty fluffy; perfect for a light reading experience.	2003-05-05

This is the story of Robot, who works in a sandwich shop and soon falls in love with a hard working, modern day woman. Robot listens to music 24/7, never taking off his headphones. The woman works hard and seems to have little else going on in her life. Their lives come together, with a few ups and downs, leading toward a surprising ending.<br />The images (which are wonderfully shaded) carry the story along effortlessly. It's always wonderful when you can read through unadorned images and laugh or go, \\"A[...]\\" The nuances of the story (the types of music Robot listens to, the speeds at which the post office can deliver your mail, etc) are really cute.<br />There's also a random character that appears now and then. In my head, I called him Frustrate-O Man. Nothing positive happens to this dude.<br />I will say a couple things... For this price, I think the book should have been hardcover. Also, it was great to have a music specifically made to accompany the story, but I didn't think there was enough of it. I would read a certain section, listening to the appropriate song (which, make no doubt, enhanced the mood of the story), but by the time the next song came on, I wasn't at the 'right' section yet. To be honest, I felt like I was under more pressure to have the Ultimate Nufonia Must Fall Experience. My advice would be to read the book through first, and then again with the music.<br />This book stands solidly on it's own and is a very good story. I'm happy to have added it to my graphic novel collection.	2003-03-31

The struggles that Young Ju and her family undergo really struck a cord with me. From reading about how hard her mother worked, I gained even more respect for my mother, who raised two daughters alone. Young Ju has a hard time being the \\"proper\\" Korean daughter when the American culture is growing to be a part of her. The is an extremely well written book that flows effortlessly. From the time Young Ju is 4 years old until she leaves for college, the reader experiences the stuggles of becoming Korean-American without forgetting/disrespecting the culture one comes from.<br />Sidebar: It was fun growing up with a Korean mother who didn't understand those wacky American ways. I would find myself, a freshman in high school, telling my mother: \\"You don't under-STAND. American kids don't HAVE curfews.\\" Ahhh hahaha, I was able to get away with so much.	2003-03-06
US	43893683	R21H082SA1NA78	0452283485	1013337	Bitten (Otherworld)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Couldn't put it down!	Other people have summed the plot of this novel, so I'll just give you my impression. This was a highly readable werewolf story and I highly recommend it. So many vampire/werewolf/witch books can be fake and unbelievable with poor dialogue. Here, the 'pack' mentality described within this book is carefully explained through believable examples. Elena is neither the damsel in distress nor the dangerous, leather-clad sexual icon - she's just very real. Also, there's a lot of interesting action in this book, which is a welcome departure from the stale/redundant plot lines too common in books today.<br />I couldn't put it down. I fell asleep reading it last night in bed and had to finish the last 20 pages it at work this morning, hiding the novel from the view of my co-workers by sticking it inside my day planner. I can't wait for the next two.	2003-02-04
US	43893683	R93KSDQAPKPLK	0689817851	160336401	Go Ask Alice	Books	5	21	42	N	N	Incredibly Moving and Powerful	Much like the film Requiem for a Dream (Aronofsky, 2000) should be shown in every high school across the country, Go Ask Alice should be required reading for every junior high student. Targeted more toward a female audience, I don't think young men won't get the powerful message conveyed in this simply written diary just as well.<br />The main character starts off as a 15-year-old girl full of angst and adolescent woes. She's not as thin as she would like to be, not as popular as she would like to be and doesn't really have any friends. Her self-esteem lies at the bottom of a canyon. When her father gets a new job and the family has to move, she sees it as a new start. Her self-esteem shoots to a mountain top. But... she doesn't make any friends right away, so her self-esteem plummets. This roller-coaster motion sets the pattern for the rest of the novel.<br />Then drugs are introduced into the story and this antagonist makes the story more all the more brutal. The events that take place are shocking and the diary format makes them more personal. The fact that it's a real diary, a true story, makes it even more poignant. You are right there with her, pulled along for all the twists and turns, ups and downs.<br />I couldn't have been more surprised with this book. First published in 1971, some of the terms may seem dated but it was more endearing than anything else. The people she meets/interacts with are written about simply but have a powerful and lasting effect. I'm not ashamed to admit I cried at a couple parts. I was swept up into story and in the end, I was left feeling dizzy.<br />It was amazing! amazing! amazing!	2002-12-15

I was surprised, as a 24-year-old female, that I was able to relate to so much in this novel. Things are written in a subtle manner and I found that the messages/feelings came to me almost subliminally. I went for a walk, to ponder some of the passages, and things didn't look or feel the same anymore. I overheard conversations that took on new meanings. Everything no longer felt... right.<br />In this story, Binx Bolling his a relatively passive guy, taking in the occational movie, taking up with the occational girl, taking care of his business. But it becomes apparent to him that there should be some meaning to what's going on. When did life get so numbingly regular? At one point, he has a conversation with an aquaintance and when they they are through talking, they part &quot;laughing and dead&quot;.<br />Binx' cousin, Kate, is a quietly frustrated 25-year-old girl. She doesn't know what she wants from life, from herself or from her family. She rides an emotional rollercoaster from withdrawn depression to outgoing euphoria. What makes her story so sad is that you see how false her euphoria is and you know things will go back to being the way they were. The more you learn about her from the things she says and the more you learn about Binx through his personal narrative, you know that if there's anyone that will understand her, it's him.<br />This is a deceptive book. The less observant might not see the words for all the truth they project. This is one of those rare books that caused me to suffer vertigo while sitting down.	2002-12-11
US	43893683	R208S5ACQ5VXI5	0743205405	756073777	Take the Cannoli: Stories From the New World	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Intelligent Observations	These stories of odd occurences, self development and intelligent observations of the world around Ms. Vowell are a pleasure to read. She writes in such a way that each story is as entertaining as it is educational. Each story pulls you along unwittingly toward a moral, whether it be the sanctity of mix tapes, American history or \\"Species-on-Species Abuse\\". She writes for more than just a punch-line, which isn't to say there weren't times I laughed out loud (e.g. Rick Derringer promoting clean guitars). A good book to take with you if you're traveling and need short stories that can stand alone.<br />Bonus: There are 5 illustrations in this book by the talented Tony Millionaire, creator of the Maakies comic. What a treat.	2002-12-07
US	43893683	R3KKSAK9LUGGDK	0679734589	597565187	The Rachel Papers	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A Refined "Youth in Revolt"	I do love reading about conniving, too intelligent for their own good, manipulative, adolescent males. In \\"The Rachel Papers\\", Martin Amis has written a coming of age novel that rivals C.D. Payne's \\"Youth in Revolt\\". The only difference, and it's a glaring one, is that Amis is British. This means that anything the main character of this novel, Charles Highway, does/says is inherently more refined than that which Nick Twisp ever could. Even though Charles describes his body habits in gross detail and uses bad language ..., he's British and that makes it seem so much more... sophisticated.<br />In this story, it is the night of Charles' 20th birthday and he is recounting his last year as a teenager. He covers his familial relationships, his pursuit of an acceptance at Oxford, his pursuit of and relationship to the lovely Rachel. Most people don't change that much in a year, but Amis does a splendid job of  showing Charles' move toward maturity. It is written in a very honest and very real way.<br />Because this is a British novel, it might be difficult to grab all the nuances/slang but that doesn't make it any less unreadable.<br />In short, this is a humorous book but not as laugh-out-loud funny as \\"Youth in Revolt\\". But then, it wouldn't be oh-so-British if it was, would it?	2002-12-07
US	43893683	R2WP65LGO5PETU	0786817070	442293804	Artemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl, Book 1)	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Could have been so much better.	You can read the other reviews/synopses too see what the book's about. I thought that it was only okay, but could have stood for more details and character development. A 12-year-old criminal genius? Sounds interesting, but that's about as far as Colfer takes us. His mother's got problems (sad) but things getter better by the end (happy). The banter between Foaly and everyone he talks to is hokey. Thoughts/scenes aren't carried out for any length of description.<br />If you've already read Nix's Sabriel books, Pullman's His Dark Materials triology, The Lord of the Rings trilogy and (of course) the Harry Potter books and you need a quick fantasy fix, then Artemis Fowl will get the job done. But you may be let down. I would recommend reading this only the fill the time until Nix's next book, Abhorsen, comes out.	2002-11-03
