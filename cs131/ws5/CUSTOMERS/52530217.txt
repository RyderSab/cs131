It is a valuable book to understand Confucianism.  It has material on classical Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism.  This is one of Dr. Tu's earlier works and the writing style is academic.  I also reacommend his later work, \\"Confucian Thought, Selfhood as Creative Transformation.\\"  The writing style is smoother in the later book, which is also valuable.  For the book being reviewed, here are the titles of the 1st 3 articles: (1) The Creative Tension between Jen and Li, (2) Li as Process of Humaniztion, and (3) The Confucian Perception of Adulthood.  It is fantastic that this book is back in print.  I believe there is going to be an increased interest in Confucianism and the timing of this book coming back into print is fortunate.  If you are interested in a practical (non-academic) book on Confucianism, I recommend the book by Robert Canright: \\"Achieve Lasting Happiness, Timeless Secrets to Transform Your Life.\\"	2004-08-29

I learned a lot.  My favorite essays were: (2) Naturalness revisited: why westerners should study Confucius, (3) Ren and Li in the Analects, (4) \\"What does Heaven Say?\\", (6) Whose Confucious? Which Analects? (7) Confucius and the Analects in the Han, (9) Unweaving the \\"one thread\\" of the Analects 4:15, and (10) An existentialist reading of book 4 of the Analects.  I highly recommend it.    The other book reviewer asked rhetorically, \\"why does Confucius continute to be a source of fascination?\\"  Confucius had a penetrating view of humanity.  The book under review is a stimulating academic book, but it does not bring you in touch with the transforming power of Confucius's lessons.  To appreciate the power of Confucian lessons to change lives I recommend the book by Robert Canright: \\"Achieve Lasting Happiness, Times Secrets to Transform Your Life.\\"	2003-11-27

What I liked best was being introduced to the work of Dr. Tu Wei-Ming.  The references gave me many works to study, which I appreciated.

I'd read summaries of Plato's philosophy before in other books: &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; by Durant has 40 pp. on Plato and &quot;From Socrates to Sartre: the Philosophical Quest&quot; by Lavine has 59 pp. on Plato. Richard Hare gives a much fuller introduction with just a few more pages (75 pp.). I learned so much more about Plato from this book, I was amazed at what I was missing from other introductions.

The reader does understand that reading Aristotle's work is even more unpleasant than reading this book. A better example of a short introduction that is done successfully is \\"Plato\\" by R.M. Hare, also from Oxford U. Press. I have no quarrel with the quality of the content in the book by Jonathan Barnes, just the organization that makes Aristotle's work seem disjointed and the presentation that makes the book dull.<br /><br />So many philosophy books only touch the mind, not our lives. For books that touch your life I recommend \\"Socrates Cafe\\" by Christopher Phillips, although it was written to follow contemporary publishers formulas.  \\"Achieve Lasting Happiness\\" by Robert Canright does not follow formulas.  It is unique, but it does not follow the Greek traditions.  It follows Chinese traditions, but Canright shows the Ancient Chinese had much in common with Aristotle.	2003-06-01

Then there is a four page long conclusion where he discusses different models of self cultivation.  A thoughtful and educational book.  There are many aspects of Confucianism, but this book focuses on self-cultivation. It was enlightening and stimulating, yet kind of academic.

I have the 3rd edition and was checking to see what newer edition there might be.  I am surprised there is no review of this book, so allow me to fill you in!  We can all put words on paper, but how do you make a plan for an effect essay?  A plan is more than an outline, it is a flow.  There is a natural way to reach an audience than you might include in an outline, but cannot come from merely using an outline.  This book will help you very well with that, and with the styling of sentences.  I have three &quot;college handbooks&quot; of writing, none of which help me at the creative stage of planning an essay.  I recently had to take some scholastic entrance exams that involved writing essays.  Even 25 years after completing my freshman english classes, I still have Baker's &quot;The Practical Stylist&quot;.  In just half an hour of review, it all came back to me.  As I sat there in the exam with the clock ticking, I was very comfortable in my writing.  I knew what I needed to accomplish and how to do it.  Thank you, Sheridan Baker, for your timeless instruction.  (If you wonder how the book might have changed from the 3rd to 8th editions, it has enlarged.  What was a small chapter 1 now is 2 chapters.  The core material is still there, starting at chapter 3.)	2002-07-06

As a developer I found it way too light on design, and missing a key part of design. This looks like a book that is not for developers. Maybe requirements people or managers will like it.  The design artifact of greatest use to a programmer goes by different names: object interaction diagram, interaction diagram, collaboration diagram, and so on.  A sequence diagram is similar. This book mentions sequence diagrams very briefly, but this most useful concept is largely missing. As a software developer, I prefer this new book: &quot;UML and the Unified Process&quot; by Jim Arlow and Ila Neustadt. Don't buy this without first looking at a real copy.

If you are in a position in the military where you are forced to read this book and you wonder why you find it boring when so many others love it, you may rest assured that it truly is boring. I slugged it out to page 137 in the 938 page hardcover version and I give up.  I cannot stand to hear another word from that corny character named Raebyrne. Here are the problems with this book. The dialog is insipid. The character development is shallow, much like the science fiction genre. There is not much action. It is a pokey, slow moving book that offers little else except perhaps a depiction of military life and action that is accurate enough to please those who have been there.  I have not been in the military, but I have enjoyed many books on military history that are far more stimulating than this novel. If you love this book, fine.

He must have looked at the way the &quot;...for Dummies&quot; series has a standard format and done something similar. I was more impressed with his treatment of Confucius. In both this book on Locke and the one on Confucius he gives us 50 pp. of content in two sections: &quot;Subject's Life and Works&quot; and &quot;Afterword&quot;.  But in the book on Locke, Strathern spent too many words poking fun at Locke and calling him boring. He also spent much more effort in describing the life and times of Locke than his philosophy.  I think Strathern must find Locke too boring to spend much time discussing his contributions. &quot;From Socrates to Sarte: the Philosophic Quest&quot; by T.Z.Lavine gives four chapters to Hume and a handful of pages to Locke. &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; by Will Durant doesn't give a full chapter to either Hume or Locke, merely including them within the context of philosophers whom Durant considers greater. So at least Strathern has given more individual focus to Locke than other writers popularizing philosophy. Strathern also, as part of his format in this 90 Minutes series, gives representative quotes from Locke's work. This is a very nice touch and I recommend the book for this reason. You can see that reading Locke is like reading the King James version of the Bible: &quot;Huh? What did he say?&quot; This is a decent book, but I did feel a bit let down while reading it, which is why I give it 3 instead of 4 stars. Also, the other reviewer made comments saying that Locke's philosophy of government depends on the inate goodness of people. That is only that reviewer's opinion. That did not come across at all in this presentation of Locke's work.	2002-03-03

Strathern's brief book reinforced some of what Jaspers said, but with much easier language. This book won't tell you a lot about Confucius and his teachings, but will let you know if you want to do any more reading. I liked his recommendation of Arthur Waley's translation of &quot;The Analects.&quot; I do wish he had given just a little more recommended reading. He didn't suggest &quot;The Wisdom of Confucius&quot; by Lin Yutang, but I recommend it. This &quot;90 minute&quot; book is a light, quick  read, which suited me at the time. Now I want to read more about Confucius (the Lin Yutang book). I like the 90 minute series and intend to read more of these volumes. Modern business just doesn't give you the luxury of time to read about philosophy. So for authors that I'm not sure I want to spend much time on, the 90 minute series is great. Strathern is a clever man. He didn't just write a book. He created a product line with a recognizable &quot;90 minute&quot; brand label!	2002-01-23

Aside from being an intelligently written book, I gave this book 5 stars because it made a big impression on me.  Jaspers explanation of Confucius made the strength of Confucious's teaching clear.  Now I'm very interested in Confucious and am reading more books about him. In that respect, this slim volume changed my life: It brought Confucious to life.  What's more, by explaining Confucius's feelings about Taoism, this slim book did more to explain classic Taoism than the 2 books on the Tao I've already read.<br />Be aware that this book is due to the editing of Hannah Arendt. This means that Jaspers did not put this book out and say &quot;Ta Da, the 4 Greatest!&quot;  No, Jaspers wrote a 2 volume book on the great philosophers due to his post War interest in increasing tolerance among men (per the Encyclopedia Britanica). This book does not appear to have any noticable Existentialist influence.<br />Finally, if you are a fundamentalist Christian, be warned that it is clear from his writing that Jaspers does not believe that Jesus is the Son of God, nor does he believe the Bible is free of error. He is not disrespectful of Jesus nor of Christianity, but do not think that because Jesus is in this book that the book is strongly pro-Jesus.	2002-01-08

This book is NOT about project management, it is about 1st line supervision.  Of course, 1st line supervisors interface with management and this book addresses that some, but that doesn't address project management  from a manager's view, just a supervisor's.  You need to know who this book  is for.  It is for an experienced supervisor, someone who can spot the  occasional errors.  In this case the errors are strongly held but misplaced  opinions.  One error the author made was to call programmers lazy who read  source code as part of a job (p. 50).  That's a foolish statement.  If  you've ever debugged someone else's undocumented code, you have to read the  source to even figure out what the code is supposed to do. He praises  people who make snap decisions (p. 20). That's silly.  It's better than no  decision, but certainly not praiseworthy.  And on pp. 113-115 he says to  &quot;Give Experts the Boot.&quot;  Here he's parroting the &quot;we need  generalists&quot; mantra that became popular about 5 or 6 or 7 years ago.   I've seen a very noticible drop in quality all over the industry. One  example, when one company I worked at got rid of their Ph.D. from MIT who  did thermal analysis and replaced him with a non-degreed mechanical  designer who was trying to run thermal analysis software, not even having a  clue on the intricacies of thermal analysis and design.  At this point the  thermal design of their computers became a joke.  Maybe it would work and  maybe it wouldn't.  Don't get me wrong.  The author has a number of good  points. E.g., fix bugs ASAP (p. 128), don't let them pile up for later. Set  your coding priorities (pp. 17-19), and do proper postmortems (pp. 78-80).   Very good book, but you must beware of his errors.  If you are young, read  this again after 10 to 15 years.	2000-06-03

It is for pre-school or kindergarten.  It is for printing in italic style.  If you want your child to learn &quot;block printing&quot;, this is not the book for you. Personally, I think a child should know how to do block printing, sometimes  called traditional manuscript.  If you buy into this series, you'll want  the instruction manual too.  If you just want to teach/learn the italic  cursive, start with book D in this series.  Be warned.  If you or your  child likes the &quot;loopy&quot; cursive, this is not for you.  Italic  cursive, starting in book D, does not have loops.  It looks a bit  different.  It is a major alternative to the old fashioned way of doing  cursive.  Remember those goofy capital &quot;Q&quot;s that looked like a  numberal &quot;2&quot;?  Italic cursive gives you a Q that looks like a Q,  unlike what I saw as a child.  I recommend considering this series.	2000-03-20

So many things are now clear to me!  Hey, now I now why one guy is working on a monitor task!  It's like I've been groping in the dark and someone has  turned the lights on.  I particulary liked the way the author explained  what features are needed for an OS to be a real time OS (RTOS).  When you  are fresh out of school the experts might explain what's going on, but once  you have any experience it's sink or swim. This book will help you avoid  sinking.	1999-12-30

The individual authors -- Rumbaugh, Booch, Jacobson -- all have worthwhile contributions to OO, but the Fusion method takes the best parts of each and puts them together. One  glaring shortcoming: some notation that the authors call the Life-Cycle  Model. It's academic junk. No one uses it. This means that you don't want  to follow their method blindly. (I didn't care much for their Visibility  Graphs, p. 80, either.)  One strength of the book is that they present a  Fusion Process Summary in Appendix A that ties things together nicely,  including a useful diagram of the entire method.  Even if you use UML, you  need to pick out what parts of UML you will use. I recommend using the  Fusion method -- minus the Life-Cycle Model (p.31) -- and do it with the  UML notation.  The book, UML Distilled, gives a nice summary of UML  notation and terms. The Fusion Method is excellant for object oriented  design.	1999-12-27

If you program in C or C++, you must read this book if you want to consider yourself a superior programmer.  If you are a college student, definitely read this book. Koenig fills in a lot of gaps left by authors of  introductory books on C or C++.  Why do I mention C++?  Because C++ is far  more than just objects and classes.  The lower level implementation of  functions is still basically C programming. He includes chapters on  linkage, the preprocessor, and portability. It is a short book that is  definitely worth reading.	1999-12-27

I suggest  that this book is best suited for readers strong in relational databases,  and maybe for those currently working with object oriented databases.	1999-12-18

But why buy it when the author has newer versions out? Because (1) it is more concise and (2) it has info not in the other editions. I recommend you read this one cover-to-cover and  buy the others as more detailed reference. His 3 other books (Advanced  Programming in the Unix Environment, Unix Net. Prog.,2nd Ed., Vol.1; Unix  Net. Programming, 2nd Ed., Vol.2) are far more detailed and worth having,  but each is very thick.  AND, the author died without finishing Unix  Network Programming, 2nd Ed., Vol.3 (Applications). You have to buy this  older edition to get the applications. It's easier to read 1 book 700 pp.  long than to read 3 books, each 700 pp. long. Time is money.	1999-12-17

But the schools now insist on what they call &quot;thinking&quot; problems. These types of problems ususally are just  confusing to kids because they are hard to understand. But the problems in  this book really do stimulate thinking and they also offer the  &quot;confusion&quot; factor that comes in trying to figure out what they  want. Hey, we are stuck with these types of problems in the schools,  whether you like them or not.  This book has excellant problems and they  have the answers in the back of the book. My daughter is 8 years old and  she has found this a challenge. You still need to drill your child in the  basic math facts, and this book does not do that, but you don't need a book  for that. You do need a workbook of &quot;thinking&quot; problems. I think  the teachers' colleges have lost their minds. This whole approach is  flawed, but this workbook will help you teach your child how to cope with  this goofy stuff. I highly recommend this book. And, wow, it's cheap!	1999-12-08

Well written.	This book is very well written. I suspect it was written with college students in mind. As a professional, I went through it like a hot knife through butter. I really liked his showing a number of ways to solve a  problem, with a discussion of the tradeoffs (e.g., iterative vs. concurrent  servers). The programming is in ANSI C. I enjoyed seeing a makefile and  some Bourne shell scripts in this book. So many authors act like this stuff  doesn't even exist. You might want to get the UNIX Network Programming,  Vol.1, book by W. Richard Stevens also.  The Stevens book serves better as  a reference and has more detail. E.g., Stevens talks about tcpdump, but  Comer doesn't. Yet Comer's book is very easy to read and gives you a clear  picture without drowning you in details.	1999-09-11

It packs a lot of useful info in less than 300 pages. I once got a job offer because I answered a programming question with a better answer than the  interviewers had up their sleave, and I got that better answer from reading  this book. Contents: (1) Optimal C Coding Style, (2) Review of Standard  Pointer and Array Operations, (3) Linear Dynamic Data Structures: Stacks,  Queues, and Linked Lists, (4) Advanced String Handling, (5) Advanced Input  and Output, (6) Bit Manipulation, (7) Recursion and Binary Trees, (8)  Multidimensional Arrays and Arrays of (Non-Char) Pointers, (9 &amp; 10) are  a variety of topics. The examples are clear, there are useful illustrations  and sample code.  An outstanding book. If the author were from AT&amp;T or  Berkeley, this would be a runaway best seller. This is an overlooked gem.	1999-07-11
US	52530217	R2BCWUPB8QEUUJ	1565921151	885921795	PThreads Programming: A POSIX Standard for Better Multiprocessing (A Nutshell handbook)	Books	3	26	29	N	N	Okay for concepts, but no help in coding	The strength of this book is it's brevity: 233 pp of text plus appendices. But the code samples are incomplete (fragments). You'll be able to get an idea of how pthreads work and the methods available, but you'll have a very  hard time if you need to actually write code. There is an error on p.126.   If you want to write code, get &quot;Programming with POSIX Threads&quot;  by David Butenhof. It has complete code examples and is not that much  longer: 305 pp of text plus appendices. But I did find this Nichols book  helpful when I was curious about pthreads. I commend O'Reilly for the nice  illustrations in this book -- above average. They helped convey concepts.	1999-06-24
