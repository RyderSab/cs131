US	53061783	R22APDSNA441I6	007135896X	958485827	Schaum's Outline  Introduction to Mathematical Economics	Books	4	46	47	N	N	An excellent resource	This is an excellent book for non-quant jockeys who want to brush up on their mathematical skills for upper-level or graduate-level econ courses.  The best strength of the book is its organization.  After a chapter on introduction and discussion of a mathematical technique or theory, a chapter on the technique's application is presented.  This is an excellent way to not only reinforce the material but demonstrate its applications and relavence to economics. <br /> <br />However, several caveats should be noted: <br /> <br />First, I believe that the ideal reader should already have some exposure to calculus.  For instance, Dowling discusses the fundamentals of differentiation in about 26 pages, which is far too little if one is learning calculus from scratch.  If the reader already has some exposure to calculus (as I did), then Dowling's chapters on differentiation and integration could be used as review. <br /> <br />Second, the learning curve really steepens in the latter chapters when Dowling discusses differential equations as he appears to sacrifice detailed explanations for brevity.   <br /> <br />Lastly, I think the reader would be best served to use this book as a resource and not just as the main text.  Mathematical Economics is a very broad and challenging subject, and as good as this book is, it only scratches the surface of a complex topic.  I would also recommend \\"Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics\\" by Alpha Chiang. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-18

It gives good profiles of overlooked schools that could very well give certain students a better education than any Ivy ever could.  Prospective college students should keep an open mind and consider all schools to find one that will provide an environment to bring out their best--whether it is an Ivy or a \\"no-name\\" school.  One of the best lines from the book: Judging a college by its selectivity or the quality its student body is like judging a hospital by the quality of the patients it admits. <br /> <br />All that said, this book is not without its drawbacks.  In his zeal to spread his message of going against the crowd, Pope overemphasizes the negative aspects of a large university and the positive aspects of the smaller colleges profiled.  It might be nice to have a one-on-one interaction with your professor, but is it really necessary when you're just learning basic physics or econ?  It might be nice to live in an idyllic, small liberal arts college environment for four years, but how prepared will you be after graduation when you are thrown into the cutthroat real world? <br /> <br />This is a great book for prospective college students.  However, I will have to employ the author's own message in addressing his preference for smaller liberal arts schools: Keep an open mind, consider all the possibilities, and find the school that will best fit your own individual needs.	2005-01-22

I must say that I was a bit turned off at first by the amount of colorful pictures and charts the Brigham book contained under the assumption that the more staid the book was, the less gimmicks it had and the better it was (like the Brealey-Myers book).  However, I was repeatedly struck by how conscise Brighams' explanations and examples were.  The book not only had exhaustive coverage, but it was very well-written.  The vignettes at the beginning of each of the chapter really shows a good application of the chapter's lesson in the real world.<br />When ever I come across a question concerning finance, I almost always reach for the Brigham and Houston book first--it's that good.	2003-06-15

The answer is, of course, the system that General Manager Billy Beane built that challenged irrational baseball orthodoxy and made the most with the least in an inefficient system.<br />Beane himself was once touted by scouts who thought he had all the right attributes: speed, power, athleticism, and, yes, \\"the Good Face.\\" When his major league career ended bitterly as an unambiguous failure, he turned his other talents to bringing rationality to an irrational baseball establishment. His new tools: statistical analysis, a willingness to discard conventional wisdom, an ability to think, and a demeanor designed to bait unsuspecting GMs into making foolish deals.<br />One of the best scenes from the book is Billy Beane in action during the 2002 trading deadline when he cobbled together a few good and undervalued players to add to the Oakland juggernaut. The funniest line in this section comes from Beane's dealings with the hapless Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a team he fleeced before: \\"[W]hile Tampa Bay's management was willing to talk to Billy, they were too frightened to deal with him.\\" A god among mere mortals indeed.<br />To me, the most engrossing part of \\"Moneyball\\" is the Oakland A's 2002 amateur draft which would lay the foundation of the team in the coming years. While other teams were quite content to gamble and to dream the very possible dream of mediocrity in selecting raw and untested high school players, the A's used their seven first round picks to draft a bunch of college no names the baseball establishment scorned. Why? They were either too short, too fat, too skinny, too slow, or even too ugly to become, in the minds of baseball scouts who supposedly knew better, future stars. Beane rightly dismissed this subjective and irrational hogwash by highlighting attributes the scouts should have paid attention to instead: on base percentage, slugging percentage, walks, strike out-to-walk ratios, and other quantifiable measures that correlate highly to future success.<br />A word on the recent controversy between White Sox GM Kenny Williams and Beane when the former accused the latter of talking too much to Lewis and making Williams look stupid in their lop-sided trades. In \\"Moneyball\\" there is not one section where Beane says anything directly disparaging about his fellow GMs, but the Oakland GM's record nonetheless speaks for itself: GMs like Williams are letting irrational and institutionalized baseball prejudices blind them and Beane took advantage accordingly.<br />In the end, baseball commissioner Bud Selig could continue to continue to chant his mantra that \\"small market teams can't compete\\" over and over until he secures taxpayers' dollars to build every stadium. Teams could continue to ignore the mounting evidence that college players are a good bet and instead blow their money and time chasing down high-risk high schoolers or over-valued mediocrity. In the meantime, the Oakland example will show (and continue to show) that how wrong--and yes, how needlessly stupid--they are.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-05-13

This book will teach the reader not only how to install Tomcat, but configure it for optimal performance. In the first few hours with the book, I had learned how Tomcat actually worked, how to connect Tomcat with my Apache server, and how to configure those sometimes cryptic server.xml and web.xml files. The book also has a chapter on JDBC for readers interested in using web-based databases and has a separate chapter for two other open-source programs: Ant and Log4J.<br />Some web-admin pros probably will not need this book, and yes, some of the information the book provides can be found for free sprinkled throughout the web. However, it cannot be denied that the Jakarta Project's own documentation on Tomcat (as well as the open-source Tomcat book on Sourceforge.net) are definitely not as thorough or good as &quot;Professional Apache Tomcat,&quot; not to mention that the book provides a convenient one-stop source for all questions.<br />Many other reviewers agree: &quot;Professional Apache Tomcat&quot; is worth its weight in gold if you use Tomcat extensively.	2003-01-06

The authors take the reader gently through the major topics of Java: classes, methods, control flow, etc. The examples and the discussions provided are not particularly deep, but for a novice programmer, they are more than sufficient.<br />I would recommend following through the examples and tutorials in the book to get a basic understanding of Java. Decide what areas you want to focus on, and get more in-depth books on those subjects. Don't expect to be a Java expert after reading this book.<br />Two last things: I would recommend this book over O'Reilly's &quot;Learning Java.&quot; That particular book is not a tutorial and novice programmers and is poorly written. Also, the second edition of the book will do just fine if you're just interested in learning the basics of Java. The second and third editions are not significantly different, and you can save yourself some real money by getting a copy of the former.	2002-12-15

Larry Ullman's &quot;MySQL: Visual QuickStart Guide&quot; is a solid introduction to a popular open source database program that's quickly becoming an industry standard. If you want a step-by-step tutorial showing you know how to set up a MySQL database and learn about the basics of relational database programming, this book's for you. Ullman even shows step-by-step instructions for different platforms, ensuring that no matter what OS you use, you won't get lost in the tutorial.<br />If you have already successfully installed your MySQL database and have tinkered around creating manipulating a few databases, you don't need this book. Instead, turn to Paul DuBois' wonderful and highly-acclaimed &quot;MySQL&quot; published by New Riders.

While the book succeeds in showing readers some simple commands to navigate through Unix, its coverage is far too shallow. Macusers interested in knowing just the basics will do better with David Pogue's section on Unix in &quot;Mac OS X: The Missing Manual.&quot; That section alone probably contains more than 50% of the material in &quot;Learning Unix for Mac OS X.&quot;<br />If you are *serious* about learning Unix for Mac OS X, get a copy of &quot;Mac OS X: Unleashed&quot; by John and William Ray. At +1,000 pages, the book is a doorstopper, but it covers almost everything a Unix power user aspirant would want to know: how to navigate through Terminal, set up an Apache webserver with PHP and MySQL, etc. Again, get &quot;Mac OS X: Unleashed&quot; only if you truly want to unlock the power of Unix in OS X.<br />In short, whether you are a casual or power user interested in learning Unix for OS X, there are better options other than &quot;Learning Unix for Mac OS X.&quot;	2002-11-05

Unfortunately, I found \\"Learning Java\\" to be a disappointment. The book begins by creating a simple \\"Hello, Java!\\" pop-up box along with brief explanations of the basic concepts of Java (class, methods, etc). The book, however, then gives an overview of syntax and tools with no practice exercises. The book essentially went like this: \\"This is what a class is. This is what a method is. This is what an exception is.\\" And so on. The book spends a few paragraphs describing many important concepts of Java without adequate examples and no practice exercises. The author's organization and presentation of the materials made the book more of a dictionary than a tutorial.<br />Don't get me wrong, the book does provide an excellent overview of Java's history and heritage. It also serves as a handy (but incomplete) reference, although \\"Java in a Nutshell\\" is a much more complete reference. However, like some reviewers, I believe that the title was a bit misleading for those wanting to actually learn to program in Java. This book is not for someone new to programming.  \\"Learning Java\\" is actually more like an overview or tour of Java that introduces the program's features and tools. It is not a tutorial. <br />My recommendation: See if you can get a hold of \\"Learning Java\\" and take a look at a few chapters.  If you like the author's approach (and several reviewers did), then by all means purchase the book.  I was originally going to recommend that only those with C or C++ programming experience give the book a try, but I've noticed several reviewers with such experience giving the book a poor review.  If you are looking for a tutorial, try the deceptively named but excellent \\"Teach Yourself Java in21 Days\\" by Laura Lemay.	2002-10-19

I can see why readers heap so much praise upon this book. The author's intent is to show the reader how to write clean HTML, arguing that since web surfers can always change their browsers' appearance settings, content is still more important than style. I am a rookie at making web pages, yet after tinkering with HTML for a few days, I had already found myself thumbing through the book for reference.<br />I am not a programmer, and I think novices could still appreciate this book. However, I *strongly* recommend that potential readers have some exposure to HTML and understand how it works before purchasing. (Check out Jennifer Niederst's excellent &quot;Learning Web Design&quot; if you need a tutorial on the Internet and HTML.) In any case, the book is mainly geared towards experienced programmers, but I honestly believe that anyone can get the most out of this book if they are willing to experiment with HTML continually through trial and error.	2002-10-15

I consider myself to be an &quot;advanced beginner&quot; (an oxymoron, of course).  To get the most out of these two books, you should know HTML well enough to read it (you should at least recognize some tags) and it would definitely be helpful if you have some programming experience. You could very well make PHP your first programming language, but I would advise against it. Start with something like Perl (whose syntax is very similar to PHP's).<br />I highly recommend both books to prospective PHP and MySQL developers who are willing to spend some time and effort.	2002-10-15

To get the most out of these two books, you should know HTML well enough to read it (you should at least recognize some tags) and it would definitely be helpful if you have some programming experience. You could very well make PHP your first programming language, but I would advise against it. Start with something like Perl (whose syntax is very similar to PHP's).<br />I highly recommend both books to prospective PHP and MySQL developers who are willing to spend some time and effort.	2002-10-15

It is not a complete *reference* where you can find any in-depth discussions on different topics or even advanced web programming techniques. I do keep the tutorial for a reference on techniques, but check out \\"Dreamweaver MX: The Complete Reference\\" for more advanced treatment. Rather, the book shows the reader how to create tables, forms, CSS, and simple JavaScript with DW MX. Each chapter covers an individual feature of DW MX with step-by-step instructions and ample pictures to guide the reader. (Honestly, you really have to be brain-dead to get lost following the instructions.)<br />I would recommend that prospective readers have some exposure and experience with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The book focuses on how to create and add web features via DW MX. In my opinion, the ideal reader will be one already familiar with some web programming techniques and design but want to know how to actually use DW MX to create their sites. Highly recommended.	2002-10-03

While Schwartz claims a novice could learn from the book, I had to re-read several passages and chapters before I fully comprehended his ideas.  Tinkering with some Perl code and writing some experimental programs with the book in hand is a must.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about learning Perl and who has some experience in Unix and/or another programming language.  I was a complete novice to both Unix and the basic concepts of programming when I bought the book.  It took me the whole night to figure out how to execute a simple &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program on Mac OS X.  After nailing down the basics of Unix through trial and error, however, I was able to execute more programs flawlessly.  Assess your abilities and your commitment honestly before making the purchase.  Good luck!	2002-09-19

I can see why readers heap so much praise upon this book.  The author's intent is to show the reader how to write clean HTML, arguing that since web surfers can always change their browsers' appearance settings, content is still more important than style.  I am a rookie at making web pages, yet after tinkering with HTML for a few days, I had already found myself thumbing through the book for reference.<br />I am not a programmer, and I think novices could still appreciate this book.  However, I *strongly* recommend that potential readers have some exposure to HTML and understand how it works before purchasing.  (Check out Jennifer Niederst's excellent &quot;Learning Web Design&quot; if you need a tutorial on the Internet and HTML.)  In any case, the book is mainly geared towards experienced programmers, but I honestly believe that anyone can get the most out of this book if they are willing to experiment with HTML continually through trial and error.	2002-09-08

Niederst then takes the reader through a sampling of topics such as graphics and frames, highlighting the do's and don'ts of web design.<br />In my opinion, I recommend this book if you are:<br />A complete newbie to the web but wants to make web pages the right way.<br />A programmer who understands the basics of HTML but does not consider him or herself a designer.<br />You will also need a dose of patience, and I also recommend you follow along her lessons with your computer with a basic text editor software like Notepad.  I would also recommend checking out &quot;Web Design in a Nutshell&quot; by the same author for a slightly more advanced and in-depth treatment of web design and &quot;HTML and XHTML: The Definitive Guide&quot; for a complete treatment of how to write HTML.<br />Lastly, Niederst doesn't cover JavaScript or CSS in this book: it is strictly an intro for beginners on the fundamentals of HTML and web design.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-07

John Walkenbach's &quot;Excel 2002 Power Programming with VBA&quot; was an informative and excellent resource that taught me most of what I was looking for.  Walkenbach begins with a brief explanation of Excel and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP), which underpins VBA.  The reader has to be patient and be willing to experiment; working through Walkenbach's examples with Excel open is almost a must.<br />There are several issues that I would like to point out.  One reviewer was upset over the fact that Walkenbach did not offer some utilities from the book's CDs for free.  I did not try any of the utilities because I was more interested in the book's actual contents and explanations.  Walkenbach does, however, offer the reader a full and unrestricted PDF version of the book in the CD, which I think is mighty generous of him.  Instead of lugging the +1,000 page book, I sometimes leave the PDF version on my laptop so I could always have it with me.  Lastly, I use Excel 97 at work and Excel X on the Mac at home, and despite some minor incompatibility issues, I would say that the book for the most part could be used for all versions of Excel 97 and up.<br />BTW, I would also recommend \\"Excel 2002 VBA\\" by Bullen, Green, Bovey, and Rosenberg published by Worx Press for a more advanced treatment of VBA.	2002-08-31

Yergin and Stanislaw show how Western intellectuals and policymakers-disturbed by the rapacious nature of unrestrained laissez-faire in the latter half of the 19th century, the \\"triumph\\" of the Soviet Union, and the agony of the Great Depression-sought to implement greater controls on their seemingly irrational and volatile economies to ensure equality in the distribution of wealth and enhancement of national power.  For the communists, their prophets were Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. For the West, their prophet was John Maynard Keynes.  Humanity's experiment with communism came to an end by the late 1980s, when it was clear that the economic system that professed equality for all resulted in poverty for all.  Mixed economies have been more successful in ensuring economic equality, but it is also clear to many in the West that the burden of maintaining the welfare state is gradually getting heavier.  Yergin and Stanislaw take the reader across different continents and countries to show how this shift occurred, giving a general overview of world economic history in the 20th century.  The authors then end by proposing several questions and issues for the reader to consider in assessing the viability and efficacy of the future economic order.<br />Readers already familiar with 20th century economic history will may still find \\"Commanding Heights\\" to be of interest, although Yergin and Stanislaw's analysis is too shallow from an academic perspective.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend \\"Commanding Heights\\" to all those interested in learning more about how the world economy today came into being, and where it could potentially go.	2002-06-27

The aim of \\"Emperor of Japan\\" is to shed some light on the life of the Meiji emperor while placing him in the context of his times.  Keene, however, only partially succeeds in this regard due to several problems he himself highlighted.  The Meiji emperor kept no diary but wrote thousands of poems, although few revealed his true thoughts; official court chronicles kept a detailed record on the emperor's activities but all were concerned with events (i.e. the emperor did this and that); and eyewitness accounts by relatives and advisors-although extremely valuable-were sometimes contradictory or inaccurate.<br />Despite such formidable obstacles, Keene nevertheless does an incredible job of bringing Meiji to life by pulling as much sources together and making educated speculations on the implications of Meiji's day-to-day activities.  Meiji was a diligent emperor who understood the gravity of his position and the responsibilities it entailed by taking a more active role than his predecessors in discussing and examining state matters with his officials.  He had toured Japan a number of times during his reign, out of the conviction that an emperor should be closer to his people.  He was open to adopting western ways but remained a traditionalist, as exemplified by his distrust of western medicine and his preference for hearing lectures on Confucian philosophy.  He placed great value on education, as shown by his propensity to tour schools and offer dictionaries as gifts to pupils and his obsession with his son's (and the future Taisho emperor) education and curriculum.<br />The real strength of the book, in this reader's opinion, is the detailed account of Japan's march towards modernity from the end of the Tokugawa shogunate through the first decade of the 20th century.  Readers will get an extremely detailed account of the Meiji Restoration, the political disputes that led to the Satsuma Rebellion, Meiji and his advisors' thoughts on the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, and Japan's search for a viable and more modern system of governance.  Individuals like Saigo Takamori and Ito Hirobumi come to life in Keene's account.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who familiar with modern Japanese history and is interested in reading this narrative on the life and times of a well-known-yet poorly understood-individual.	2002-06-27
US	53061783	R2UNMW2J8PG97J	0300028849	35513314	1587, A Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline	Books	5	47	49	N	N	A *must* read for all serious students of Chinese history!	A reviewer below has already done an excellent job of summarizing the book, so I can only hope that my review can serve as a complement.  \\"1587\\" is essentially an examination of why the Ming dynasty--an institution that commanded great wealth and governed a vast nation--was already showing signs of decay and its impending collapse under the reign of the Wanli emperor.  Ray Huang does an excellent job to show how cultural inertia and an institution that governed miserably effectively neutralized the voice and power of individual participants.  The Ming dynastic system did not tolerate loyal opposition and was not designed for ministers or individuals to discuss opposing views in an orderly manner, which meant that power struggles were bound to be ugly as rival ministers and bureaucrat employed moral arguments to tarnish each others' reputation. Avenues for advancement within government amounted to a zero-sum game in which an official's effectiveness in governance was a barometer of his morality (bound with tradition and Confucian precepts open to interpretation).  Imagine if your local mayor was judged not on his or her effectiveness or merit, but on whether he or she was a morally upright individual who was adhering to both the spirit and traditions of the past.<br />The Ming imperial system also placed a greater value on the institution and sought to dehumanize the emperor. The emperor was the emperor--he was not Wanli, not Jiajing, etc. The bureaucrats and officials--whose power was constrained individually--exercised great power as a group, effectively dictating how the emperor should act, behave, and present himself to the public.  Little wonder then, that the Wanli emperor, whose power was in the negative and not the positive, hardly sought to rule in an effective manner after being weighed down by such an institution.  Others in the drama--the powerful minister, the innovative general, the eccentric bureaucrat, and the dissenting scholar--would find the same forces inhibiting their ability to affect real changes.<br />Huang ends his book by concluding that the Ming dynasty was a \\"highly stylized society wherein the roles of individuals were thoroughly restricted by a body of simple yet ill-defined moral precepts, [and that] the empire was seriously hampered in its development, regardless of the noble intentions behind those precepts.  The year 1587 may seem to be insignificant; nevertheless, it is evident that by that time the limit for the Ming dynasty had already been reached. It no longer mattered whether the ruler was conscientious or irresponsible, whether his chief counselor was enterprising or conformist, whether the generals were resourceful or incompetent, whether the civil officials were honest or corrupt, or whether the leading thinkers were radical or conservative-in the end they all failed to reach fulfillment. Thus our story has a sad conclusion. The annals of the Year of the Pig (1587) must go down in history as a chronicle of failure.\\"<br />I recommend this book for all those not only interested in the history of the Ming dynasty, but to those who are interested in the nature of Chinese imperial statecraft and the question of how government should be structured.	2002-06-21

Caro's narrative shows several interesting sides of LBJ as senate Majority Leader: 1) LBJ was no bigot, but was hardly a champion for the downtrodden and the oppressed, 2) LBJ was in some ways a \\"compassionate\\" man, but ambition always overrode compassion when the two came into conflict, 3) LBJ owed his rise to preeminence through ingratiating himself with \\"the three R's\\"-FDR, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, and powerful Georgia senator Richard B. Russell, and 4) the Civil Rights Act of 1957, so-oftened hailed as LBJ's legislative triumph in outmaneuvering conservatives, was actually a watered-down and ineffective law passed with the tacit approval of the Dixiecrats.<br />Caro contends that while power may or may not corrupt, it certainly does reveal, and LBJ's time as Majority Leader show a shrewd, ambitious, and political man who never forgot individuals who crossed him and used his power to punish accordingly.  In this sense, Caro did an incredible job of offering readers a portrait of a man and his time.  <br />One flaw I find with this book is the absence of footnotes.  While Caro does cite his sources, the absence of footnotes made it difficult for this reader to reference or crosscheck his sources.	2002-06-08

Jim Carlton's \\"Apple\\" is a fascinating account about the growth, the fall, the rebirth, and the slow decline of one of Silicon Valley's original PC pioneer.  It provides an exhaustive account of the egos and problems within the top ranks that prevented Apple from being a great company.  Again and again, Carlton shows how Apple blew opportunities to become a \\"standard\\" in the PC industry if it had licensed its technology, merged with a partner like IBM or Sun, or just had the competence to execute effectively and efficiently.<br />For the most part, I do agree with Carlton's account.  However, one cannot help but feel after reading numerous accounts of Apple's \\"failures\\" or \\"lost opportunities\\" if Carlton is making too much out of Apple's strategy.  Carlton also implicitly believes that becoming \\"the standard\\" could have been and should have been Apple's only goal.  Naturally, like another reviewer, I got tired of reading Carlton's 20/20 hindsight version of history that harps on every failure as somehow contributing to the company's decline.<br />The book was also published around 1999, so while it does include a section on Job's return and Apple's introduction of the iMac, it naturally missed out on some of Apple's more recent accomplishments: the new TiBook, the iBook, OS X, the \\"digital hub\\" strategy, and the fact that Apple is sitting pretty these days as other Wintel box makers are seeing their companies disintegrate under brutal price wars and commoditization.  Overall, Carlton's book provides a good history of the company, but its propensity to apply a 20/20 hindsight type of history that harps on every mistake the company made gets annoying after awhile.	2002-02-18

The book is very well-written and readable since the author employs plain english (no pun intended) to make his three major points: 1) accounting numbers--while by no means perfect--are excellent tools in evaluating stocks, 2) accounting-based stock valuation is superior to (but does not neccessarily supplant) cash flows, and 3) competition ensures that eye-popping financial performance doesn't last forever.<br />Contrary to another reviewer, English employs excellent examples to clarify and explain his points.  Some examples: Gateway 2000's earnings history was used to explain how to find and interpret non-recurring items (NRI) on financial statements.  Ratio analysis was demonstrated by looking at the PC industry in 1998.  Emerson Electric was the company chosen to show why mature companies were still good buys.  Many other examples abound, and English does a successful job in tying their relevance to his arguements.<br />But successful use of examples is not just the only strength of the book.  The author also tackles a range of topics complete with insightful and clear discussions: the flaws of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), Economic Value Added (EVA), financial statement analysis, fundamental analysis, etc.<br />A quick glance at the table of contents below gives you an idea of the scope of English's book.

It gives readers a vision of a post-apocalyptic society that is still trying to wrestle with its destiny while vaguely attuned to the fact that another invasion is coming.  McKinney's story of four teenage orphans on the run from both the government and the yakuza in the crazy underground city of Tokyo provides a perfect blend of the cyberpunk theme and the main Robotech storyline.<br />Robotech fans will enjoy the story of the brilliant--but insane--Dr. Lazlo Zand's first contact with the Robotech Masters and the rivalry between the Southern Cross and the remnants of the RDF.  I was personally impressed with McKinney's imaginative setting of a world recovering from war, and a society strangely similar to George Orwell's vision of the future in &quot;1984.&quot;<br />Although this is an excellent story in its own right, only serious fans of the Robotech saga would be able to appreciate the story's background.

He shows why and how investors should hold a broadly diversified portfolio.  He promises no gimmicks but merely some wise advice on what to do with your money.  His writing style is clear, and he peppers his advice with a touch of humor that--at the very minimum--makes this book an interesting read.<br />Most controversial has been Malkiel's support of the efficient market theory, which leads him to believe that &quot;Investors would be far better off buying and holding an index fund than attempting to buy and sell individual securities or actively managed mutual funds.&quot;  In the thirty years since its first edition, Malkiel's assertion has been supported by an ever-growing mountain of evidence that shows how, over the long run, an index fund outperforms the average actively managed fund.  Few believe this advice, and prefer to show how smart they are through active trading, seeing their gains eaten away by brokrage commissions, management fees, short-term capital gains taxes, etc.  Even Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch--the most successful traders in history--have admitted that most investors would be better off holding an index fund.  Malkiel DOES NOT argue that you should not trade individual stocks or not buy options.  He just explains why holding stocks instead of engaging in rapid fire trading will yield hefty returns over the long run.  He also shows how options could be a great hedge against uncertainty--if you know what you are doing.<br />This is a great book that every investor should read.	2000-12-18

I had used this book for my Introduction to Statistics class, and I think it was the best $60 I had ever spent.  The authors explain all the major statistical concepts clearly and succinctly, drawing on a variety of samples and adding a touch of humor.  The math in this book is more than doable; anyone with a basic grasp of algebra and a willingness tackle numbers is the only prerequisite to understanding this book.  However, the authors also try to convey to the reader that there is more to statistics than just numbers.  How an experiment is constructed, how polls are taken, what biases exist, and how assumptions are made are all integral parts of statistics.  This book is applicable to almost every subject--political science, sociology, sciences, engineering, etc.  There are enough exercises in the chapters to assist the reader in reviewing the concepts.  I can't stress this enough: Buy this book and you won't regret it!	2000-11-22

Another reader commented that those who want an introduction to this topic is &quot;wasting their time and money.&quot;  I believe otherwise.  If you have a strong interest in the subject, this book will prove very usable.  I was surprised that this book was not very math-intensive since the authors assume that the reader already has a rudimentary understanding of finance and accounting.  Robert Higgins' &quot;Analysis for Finance Management&quot; is an excellent companion to &quot;Valuation.&quot;	2000-11-21

It explains every calculation simply and without any technical (and incomprehensible) jargon found in many textbooks.  It includes examples, hints, and a glossary of important financial concepts.  If you are willing to learn, then this book is for you.  A good reference tool for even pros.  A bit expensive but NOT sorry to have bought it.	2000-10-22
US	53061783	RLOFACFD2X75Y	0679410708	544454716	The American Century	Books	5	17	19	N	N	An excellent book that should be read	Don't let the &quot;coffee book table&quot; size or look of the book fool you; &quot;The American Century&quot; is a very well written and very well thought out book.  Its central thesis: Through political, economic, and social changes, the promise of American democracy (along with freedom, equality, and justice) slowly became a reality for all Americans.<br />Some criticisms leveled at this book are quite off the mark. One reader slammed Evans for imposing his own views and opinions on the past and thus committing a &quot;cardinal sin.&quot;  Ridiculous.  No history is free of judgement or opinions. Whether it is in an overt statement or how the facts are presented, history is never impartial or neutral.  Another criticism is that the book is a product of leftist revisionism.  Perhaps, but a closer reading reveals otherwise.  Evans, for instance, claimed that Ronald Reagan was &quot;no racist&quot; despite the fact he opened his 1980 campaign in the Deep South in the town where the three civil rights workers were murdered.  He was also quite easy on Richard Nixon, describing his handling of the Alger Hiss case as &quot;fair&quot; and dismissing any notions that Watergate was part of some Oliver Stone-esqe conspiracy that somehow involved JFK's assassination.<br />The pictures alone make this book a good buy.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a solid grounding in American history but would like to get a different perspective.	2000-10-13
US	53061783	R6EZGARIVYWVF	0393307808	827530852	The Search for Modern China	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A magnet for the eyes	War, revolution, drama, triumphs and defeats: It's all here in this 800+ page book.  Spence, a scholar with unquestionable competence, does a great job detailing the struggle of a nation trying to claim its place in the modern world.  From the conquest of the Manchus to the dominance of Western powers, from the fall of the last imperial dynasty to the birth of a republic, and from the tragedy of Tiananmen to the promise of a better future, the reader gets a sense of history unfolding before his own eyes.  The beautiful photographs and illustrations included brings the reader even closer to being a witness of history	1997-03-29
