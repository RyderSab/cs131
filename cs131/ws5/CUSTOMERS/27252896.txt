Hanh's work during the conflicts in Vietnam and his teachings since have inspired many followers and disciples, and the writings in this book, with a few exceptions, follow his conception, a conception which seems to me inadequate to face up to the gravely mounting threats to life and happiness in the world.<br /><br />The vision of Engaged Buddhism presented in most of the essays is individualist, metaphysical, naively pacifist, and bereft of class analysis. So it offers inadequate insight into the forms and approaches of collective action that we will need to avert global catastrophe.<br /><br />A few examples of the kind of crippled thinking I'm talking about: \\"We always deserve our government.\\" (p.106); \\"If the leaders of all nations had all the information about the consequences of their actions, they would desist from the foolish policies they espouse.\\"(p.89); \\"The success of nonviolent struggle can be measured only in terms of the love and non-violence attained, not whether political victory was achieved.\\"(p.63) These sorts of blindnesses to the structural and institutional nature of oppression and violence in our world would preclude effective social engagement, in the mechanincal sense of the word, and replace it with spinning wheels. Real engagement will mean a meshing and monkeywrenching with the hard gears and cogs of a system that increasingly resembles a runaway train.<br /><br />Gary Snyder, whose political views and spiritual practices were formed independently of Hanh, offers in his contribution the most important corrective to this worldview: \\"The mercy of the West has been social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void. We need both.\\"<br /><br />The other essays that I found most useful were Hanh's and Laity's discussions of the Six Concords of the sangha, as they have applied them to life in their community of Plum Village.<br /><br />For a more thorough, constructive critique of the Engaged Buddhist tradition from an anarchist perspective, I highly recommend seeking out Ken Knabb's pamphlet \\"Strong lessons for Engaged Buddhists\\" on the web.of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void.

Personally, it has helped me begin to gain real insight into myself, my friends and family, and my society.<br /><br />Synthesizing psychoanalysis, western philosophy, and eastern meditation techniques, the book presents a new and vital perspective on mental health and illness, as well as a series of exercises and practices designed to bring us into closer contact with our daily experience and gain insight into the neurotic mechanisms by which we ward off excitement and growth.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts (their intended order reversed by the publisher). In the second part, the foundational theory of Gestalt Therapy is layed out. The presentation is vague and unsystematic, but its insights and approaches are crucial. Breaking with Freud, and developing Wilhelm Reich's methods of Character Analysis, the authors shift the focus of therapy from our memories, dreams, and unconscious functions, onto our present, aware functions.<br /><br />Gestalt Therapy defines the self as our individual, historically, culturally, and biologically determined system of contacting our environment. Health, in GT terms, is the ability to recognize and act on elements in our environment to satisfy our impulses.<br /><br />The 'gestalt' comes from gestalt _psychology_, a non-therapeutic German experimental discipline which studied the way we discern 'figures' from the 'ground' of experience. (Think of the famous picture that looks like a candlestick or two silhouetted faces-- each of these images is a 'figure' or 'gestalt' formed from the 'ground' of light and dark on the page.) The crucial ability of the healthy individual, according to Gestalt _Therapy_ is the power to easily form 'gestalts' from the experiential 'ground' of daily life, recognizing opportunities for fulfillment in the environment and acting on them with vigor and grace.<br /><br />Unhealth, or neurosis, on the other hand, is conceived of in GT as 'interrupted excitement', a habitual breaking of contact with our environment and our impulses, an inability to form gestalts. Our neuroses work by avoiding novelty, tensing our muscles against impulses, and projecting our desires and resentments onto others. These neurotic strategies, Goodman and Perls observe, are pandemic in our culture, and manifest themselves in widespread anxiety, boredom, resentment, and violence.<br /><br />Part One contains a series of 18 exercises in awareness and contact through which we can begin to recognize our neurotic mechanisms and the impulses they ward off. They form the practical core of the Therapy, and deal variously with focusing attention on breathing, body sensations, emotional reactions, eating, and speech, etc. Some are more clearly conceived and presented than others.<br /><br />Ultimately, this great book is not a theoretical template to be applied. Rather, it provides an orientation, and an _invitation_ to assume the responsibility for our own well-being, discovering \\"What excitements do I refuse to accept as my own? Where do I begin to avoid or suppress them? How do I do hinder myself?\\" Gestalt Therapy is a call to awareness, a challenge to start to contact our experiences, change our behaviors, and grow. It is a book the must be lived with, tried, challenged, discussed, returned to. I recommend going through the exercises in the first part, then reading and digesting the 2nd, then returning to the exercises.<br /><br />\\"Relaxing deliberateness, interpreting oneself, feeling one's body and emotions, these don't themselves solve any problems.

Set largely in Naples, it picks up where his masterpiece Kaputt left off, and nearly attains the haunting, hallucinogenic power and bitter humor of his earlier work.  <br /> <br />'The Skin' is tainted, however, by a deep misanthropy that permeates the work, and which was perhaps latent in Kaputt but seemed more justified when directed against the Nazis and other Fascists he encountered than against his countrymen. This misanthropy is voiced explicitly on a few occasions, but most venomously expressed in his racist, homophobic, and red-baiting descriptions of black American soldiers and upper class gays, respectively. So the hopeful, humanist note on which he ended Kaputt decays sourly as he recounts his experience in the ruins of Naples following the Allied landing.      <br /> <br />Translator David Moore doesn't attain the fluid clarity of Foligno's English rendering of Kaputt, and he irritatingly refuses to translate the French and German conversations that appear throughout the book. His rendering of Florentine street idiom in Cockney accents is a poor choice. <br /> <br />Overall, not the equal of Kaputt, but still a memorable book.	2005-09-09

Welch's short book contains 4 parts. In the first part, he explains that the ambiguous nature of the ancient Chinese characters, compounded by the oftent inscrutable and paradoxical writing style of Lao Tzu himself, makes definitive translation and interpretation of the text impossible.     In the second part, he offers his own informed and wise interpretation of the the Tao Te Ching, explicating three inter-related central concepts: (1)the doctrine of 'wu-wei' (spontaneity and non-interference in action), (2)the concept of 'pu' (original human nature (literally 'the uncarved block'), the way of the newborn child as an ideal counterposed to the adult corruption introduced by society), and (3)the mystical experience of the 'tao', or 'way' of the universe through meditation.    In the third part, Welch lays out the bizarre history of the development of Taoism since Lao Tzu, its intersections with other religions, and its devolution into arcane practices of asceticism, alchemy, hygiene, and geomancy.    In the final section, Welch offers a reading of the relevance of Lao Tzu's teachings to the present day (c. 1950s) that now seems pretty dated and hackneyed.    I recommend the first 2 parts as a valuable and illuminating companion text for anyone reading the Tao Te Ching.	2005-09-09

In this overlooked tour-de-force, Malaparte brings Sherman's commonplace to life, rendering World War II Europe with a grotesque, sardonic clarity that has its closest analogue in Dante's visions of the Underworld.  <br /> <br />Malaparte was the gadfly of the Italian Fascists, and an oficer, war correspondent, and diplomat during the early years of WWII. Kaputt, a manuscript smuggled out of Nazi territory, consists of a series of vignettes alternating between firsthand accounts of the savage bloodshed of the Eastern Front, and the dinner parties of the debauched Fascist political and diplomatic elite. It presents a unique insider portrait of the Axis elites and their collaborators, and a grim and unforgettable account of the battlefields, slaughter, and ruined cities of Europe.  <br /> <br />Beautiful translation. Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />A sidenote: the system of symbolic correspondence between nationalities and animals which Malaparte structures the book around was cribbed nearly whole cloth by Art Spiegelman for his comic-book masterpiece Maus; Spiegelman in turn never ceases complaining that Spielberg ripped of _his_ framework of animal caricatures in the cartoon feature \\"An American Tail\\".	2005-08-22

He describes the way these nominally multilateral institutions were shaped by the US to perpetuate and extend its hegemony over the particulars of world trade and finance, opening foreign markets to US producers while protecting domestic industries with tariffs, ensuring ample flows of raw materials to US manufaturers and stunting the development of 3rd world nations.  <br /> <br />In his most penetrating analysis, Hudson describes the way the US managed to turn its chronic trade deficits from the Vietnam War era onward into a mechanism of \\"Super-Imperialism\\": by unmooring the dollar from the gold standard, the US established a 'debtor imperialism' whereby nations with trade surpluses against the US were forced to buy US treasury bills in lieu of gold. The rest of the world is thus forced to finance the growing US trade deficit (and thus US military interventions) in perpetuity, or face a meltdown of the current world economic order and a collapse in the value of their own immense dollar holdings. <br /> <br />Hudson's presentation of the intricacies of the events and negotiations that gave rise to the present order are somewhat belabored and presume a familiarity with macro-economics. For the layperson, his basic thesis is clearly presented in the preface and introduction, and those without a special interest in economic history are advised to pass over the body of the book.	2005-07-24

Reich argues for a new practice of \\"Character Analysis\\" that takes the whole personality  under examination, superceding the old therapy that focused narrowly on alleviating painful 'symptoms'.<br /><br />Our characters, Reich points out, are not created by chance or heredity, but represent the habitual strategies by which our egos come to cope with external threats, secure pleasure and sustenance, and regulate the flow of sexual energy. They are most definitively shaped by our interactions with our parents in the first few years of life and sexual development. Moreover, Reich argues, our characters are created and recreated in service of systems of social and class domination; thus sexual psychology and class struggle are inextricable.<br /><br />Chalquist's glib distortion of Reich's project in the comment below is typical of the attacks Reich's work was subject to in the vicious campaigns to to quash his influence by Nazis, the Psychoanalytic establishment, and the Authoritarian left alike. Nowhere does Reich suggest that simply having more sex is the solution to social problems. Rather, he asserts that widespread healthy sex-life is both a necessary condition and an inevitable result of successful class struggle and social emancipation. For those interested in what this means concretely for social movements, his book Sex-Pol is highly recommended.<br /><br />The typology of Characters that Reich draws up in the closing chapters is vague and ill-presented, leading me to suspect that the distinctions and psycho-sexual mechanisms he was describing weren't clear even in his own mind. And yet there are occassional flashes of insight into behavior that I immediately recognized as true of myself and my friends and family.<br /><br />Reich's insights have deep ramifications for parenting, schooling, and political organizing, and were formative on the work of the New Left. this book is highly recommended for people interested in such questions.<br /><br />The last sections of the book are concerned with Orgone research, which I haven't investigated myself but which seem pretty wacky.	2005-07-08

These efforts resulted in his being outcast from both the CP and Freud's psychoanalytic circles. In the years following, Reich was dismissed as a crank for his studies of the 'Orgone', but these early writings on sexuality and class struggle were to prove prescient in light of the upheavals of the 1960s. <br /> <br />Bertell Ollman's introduction is a pithy summation of Reich's project and his importance, and indeed presents the key ideas in the book in a more concise and transparent fashion than Reich himself. <br /> <br />The first essay is a rather belabored effort to reconcile Marx and Freud, but it perhaps provides a useful introduction to dialectical materialism and psychoanalysis. <br /> <br />The central piece, \\"The Imposition of Sexual Morality\\" relies on some rather sparse anthropological evidence to chart the course of human development from the free sexuality of matriarchal society through the sexual repression that marriage institutions of paternal, accumulative society require. Here as elsewhere, Reich makes some striking assertions about the role and origins of sexual repression, but he is less fastidious than his mentor Freud in making clear claims illustrated by example. <br /> <br />In the latter essays, Reich makes some suggestions, drawn from his experiences in Germany, as to how a program of sexual liberation might be incorporated into the larger struggle to develop class consciousness and bring about socialism.	2005-06-23

In Essay I he charts a progression in the history of western literature from myth through romance through realism to irony in which the hero becomes increasingly human. Essay III envisions different archetypal literary forms (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) as continuous phases of a central quest-myth that recurs throughout the history of western literature, and lays out a rich and resonant typology of their symbolism.  <br /> <br />I found Essays II and IV, which are concerned with forms of symbolism, and genres, respectively, to be somewhat muddled, and much less insightful than the other two essays. <br /> <br />Bottom line- if you read Essays I and III you will gain a new and lasting insight into the stories you come across and the way they work, be they novels, films, plays or poetry. <br /> <br />Highly recommended as an antidote to the facile post-modernism and literary identity politics that most English departments are awash in these days.  <br /> <br />For those reading the book, I also recommend googling Everett Frost's recreation of the mandala diagram of Essay III that Frye left out of the manuscript.	2005-05-10

Hinton's saga immerses the reader in the shocking, brutal war of each against all that characterized life in rural China in the years before the revolution, and the struggles, challenges, excesses, and corrections that realized the equitable redistribution of agricultural land from the hands of a few landlords to the peasants who tilled it.<br /><br />Eighteen years in the making, the book presents a revolutionary process of rich complexity, constructing a narrative with deep insight and revealing illustration that ranges beyond simple class and economic analysis into questions of organization, family, gender, sexuality, and human frailty, courage, discipline, and altruism.<br /><br />Like the real work of revolution, the long narrative has its slow, grinding parts, but the book is punctuated with many moments of clarity, humor, and human recognition, and rewards the diligent reader immensely.<br /><br />Contrary to the crude and invidious red-baiting review posted by Mr. Collins on this site, Hinton in fact takes great care to examine the violent excesses of the early days of the revolution in the village; indeed the latter half of the book is concerned precisely with the attempts of the community to come to terms with the initial violence and authoritarianism of the Communist Party members and cadres.	2005-04-05

They also contain some of his most dubious constructs (the castration complex, penis-envy), and a bizzare treatment of female sexuality and super-ego formation that will seem sexist to the modern reader, if not outright misogynist. Sadly, the most controversial of these concepts are not illustrated with the kinds of clinical examples that readers of Freud will have come to expect, relish, and rely on, and thus are very difficult to come to grips with.  <br /> <br />The remainder of the work is a rather cursory attack on various disciples and rivals, and an attempt to place psychoanalytic theory within a scientific worldview in contraposition to religion and Marxism, as well as a suprisingly credulous treatment of the occult. <br /> <br />For the educated layperson seeking a general familiarity with Freud, I would recommend beginning with the Introductory Lectures, and then cherrypicking lectures 31 and 32 of this work for a synopsis of later developments in the theory.	2005-03-09

His humble, direct writing, grounded in a wealth of personal experience in the military and sharpened by years of disciplined autodidactic study, raises many important issues for the anti-capitalist left. His comparison of the Colombian FARC with the Zapatistas in Mexico is an incisive challenge to unexamined pacifism, and his discussion of radical leadership and forms of organization will stimulate anarchists and authoritarian communists alike. I, for one, will be reading his blog closely in the coming months. <br /> <br />A few favorite passages: <br /> <br />\\"Every successful revolution requires either the neutralization or active participation of military people. It's really time we factor that into our thinking. It's time we thought about organizing within the military. And organizing is not helping out a handful of conscientious objectors (though that is important) or dropping into Fayetteville with antiwar petitions for GIs to sign. Organizing is getting to know them, listening to them, building relationships with them, and standing alongside them when they confront their own institution.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I will say this about the Zapatistas and the FARC-EP. At the end of the day, the difference between the two, aside from those who are condoned or condemned by those outside the conflict, is that one is winning and one is losing... because one understands the iron logic of war, and the other does not.\\"	2005-03-03

The prose is delightful-- erudite, lucid, penetrating (ha!), and illustrated with beautifully observed examples from literature, history, and Freud's own life and practice.	2005-03-03

I was not disappointed.    This book is a plain-spoken, humble, wise, good-natured, and non-tendential introduction to a variety of buddhist spiritual outlooks and practices, with particular attention to Vipassana (insight meditation) and Korean Zen methods. I strongly recommend it both to novice meditators and more experienced practitioners. Each will find an ample store of insight, example, and inspiration for continued practice within its pages.    Stephen Batchelor's luminous formalist photography of the everyday nicely complements the unadorned truths of the writing, though the overstylized graphic design undermines the impact of the images.	2005-02-21

Big and small, legal and il-, the 62 recipes run the gamut from dumspter-diving to banner drops, open relationships to locking down streets, monkeywrenching to coalition building. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the direct action tactics that have developed in anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian circles in recent years. <br /> <br />One gripe-- the section on \\"undermining oppression\\" is a clumsy and unfortunate endorsement of the kind of identity politics that have so recklessly divided the left.	2005-01-31

It brings alive the great figures and achievements of working class struggle that have been distorted by or excised from mainstream histories. Highly recommended for anyone who has read \\"A People's History of the United States\\" and wants to know more. <br /> <br />Sadly, the book pussyfoots around the important role of communists in the labor movement, and almost totally erases the contributions of anarchists-- mentioning Sacco and Vanzetti's political convictions only in passing, and completely eliding the fact that Albert Parsons and other Haymarket martyrs were anarchists. Also, it ends on a rather pat and rosy note of hope that the then (1955) newly-formed AFL-CIO would rally American labor to even greater achievements. Thus it offers few lessons for the routed, coopted labor movement of today. Important conclusions about internal democracy and autonomy that could have been drawn from labor's defeat are left to readers to draw for themselves.  <br /> <br />One more thing-- <br />Notice that those reviewers who paint this book as 'biased' don't actually attempt to refute any of the factual matter Boyer and Morais bring to light. Having a point of view is no crime, in fact it clarifies debate to state your allegiances and conviction in the open, as the authors do. Attempting to conceal bias behind a facade of objectivity, as mainstream textbooks and news sources do, is what ought to be called into question.	2005-01-30

The book offers virtually no wisdom on the questions of how to live and act as a human being in the world. Her reduction of politics to a question of personal animosity is naive and dangerous. Her presentation of Buddhist concepts is imprecise, and her examples don't come alive for me. <br /> <br />For those hoping to find an inspiring presentation of Buddhist wisdom and its relevance to modern life, I recommend the writings of Stephen Batchelor, Jack Kornfeld, and Larry Rosenberg. Batchelor's \\"Buddhism Without Beliefs\\" is a marvel of clarity and truth. Also, the 'engaged buddhism' tradition begins to engage in questions of political commitment and human progress in much more sophisticated and useful ways than Chodron.	2005-01-29

In the book's first half, he argues convincingly that the general prosperity that blossomed in America after WWII permitted people to retreat into 'counterfeit communities' in the suburbs, in which fear of the overwhelming diversity and disorder of urban life stunts suburbanites at an adolescent phase of personal growth, resulting in stultifying conformity, and confounding the possibility of personal growth and real communal life. <br /> <br />In the second part, he comes up with a muddy and rather conflicted vision of a rebirth of city life based on a sort of half-anarchism not worthy of the name. His proposals, while showing a healthy respect for diversity and local control, would have benefited from a clearer understanding of the history of utopian anarchist thought. As it is, his description of anarchism  as purely nihilistic and anti-urban is spotty and misleading, and his proposals lack clarity in their  outcomes and implementations. <br /> <br />For a more practical reformist proposal for the re-invigoration of urban community based partly on Sennett's critiques of suburbia, see Gerald Frug's excellent recent book 'City Making'. For clearer visions of possible anarchist societies, see the works of Kropotkin, Pannekoek, Murray Bookchin and Ken Knabb.	2005-01-11

Its central thesis, that modern American life is governed by a fusion of bourgeouis and bohemian values, is simply spurious. I do not recommend this book for anyone seeking a better understanding of the underpinnings of class and the currents of culture in the US. Better to go back and read the classics Brooks references: Paul Goodman, Arendt, Daniel Bell, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte. Things haven't really changed so much as Brooks claims.  <br /> <br /> <br />A few particular quibbles I have with the book: <br /> <br />1) What Meritocracy? <br />Brooks argues that the era of WASP privilege has been eclipsed by a brave new age of meritocracy ushered in by standardized testing and egalitarian college admissions practices. This is true in part, but grossly overstated by Brooks. The levers of power in our society are still held by white protestant men, despite a Kissinger here and a Condi there. Further, the best predictor of SAT scores continues to be parental income. The legacy system is alive and well. Perhaps the most gaping hole in Brooks' analysis is the absence of any mention of the middle and working classes, and their position with regard to the upper-middle  <br />class he examines. <br /> <br />2)Bobos, or just yuppies? <br />When GW Bush, the born-again blueblood scion of generations of CT Yankees is said to be a Bobo, does the term really have any meaning? Despite repeated assertions, Brooks does not make a convincing case that his 'Bobo' represents a new and equal synthesis of the Bohemian and the Bourgeouis. The caricatures Brooks presents for inspection represent a superficial bohemianism, a bohemianism of the checkbook. They are simply the old bourgeouis, sans Christianity, and with a life thoroughly colonized by 'you-are-what-you-buy' consumer capitalism. True bohemianism, to me, means sacrificing the stultifying comforts of bourgeouis society (security, material possessions, safety from criticism, and yeah, good dental care) for the risks and rewards of a life in search of beauty and truth, whether that happens in front of a canvas, in the wilderness, on the barricades, or in the monastery. <br /> <br />3) Don't kill your idols, reread them! <br />Brooks' attempt to repudiate the great cultural critics and public intellectuals of the last century (like Lionel Trilling and Hannah Arendt) in favor of the TV and op-ed pundits of our time is craven and presumptive. The old guard made statements that were too sweeping, Brooks argues, too hostile to the mainstream. What's worse, he maintains, they weren't in touch with 'real life', as it's lived in the boardroom and cul-de-sac. Much better, he argues, are the great sound-bite critics of our day, who can offer up a few glib, unthreatening bon mots between commercials, sanctifying the bourgeouis mores they know so intimately. Great critics such as, well, David Brooks. I leave it to the reader to judge the relative merits of the critical output of the 1950s against that of our own era.	2004-12-30

Other reviewers have complained that the book lacks structure, but hey, so does life, and what the novel lacks in conflict and suspense it makes up for in its faithful, regretful depiction of a now-vanished urban milieu. The black characters in the novel don't quite come alive for me, through a failure of omission rather than any particularly wrong notes struck. Similarly, the adult Dylan of the second half of the book is something of a cipher.  <br /> <br />All in all though, a moving account of a young person's failures to make human connections across racial and cultural barriers.	2004-12-06

The interlaced series of biographical sketches of communist and socialist figures of the late 19th and early 20th century are engaging, thoroughly researched, and well-written, but often border on caricature. Lenin is painted as a saint, and the anarchists are given short shrift, represented only by a sketch of Bakunin as a vicious nihilist. Wilson gives voice in analyzing his characters to form of ethnic essentialism that is now discredited, starting more than a few sentences with phrases like \\"Only a Jew...\\".<br /><br />The actual details of organizing, strategy, tactics, mistakes, and successes that went into the uprisings of 1848, 1871, 1905, and 1918 are ignored in favor of intellectual history and personal/family anecdotes of the figures involved, which, though understandable given that the writer relies on published writings and personal correspondence to construct his narrative, isn't particulary useful. Marx's labor theory of value, which is to my mind perhaps his most powerful insight, is hastily dismissed by the author, and Wilson's brief attempt to paint America as a virtually classless society seems like naive apologia given the rapidly increasing inequality of wealth in our society.<br /><br /> The first couple chapters, a historiographical analysis of French writers, is boring-- I recommend that those interested start with part 2 of the book.	2004-12-05
