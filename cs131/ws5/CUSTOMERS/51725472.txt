Lowell was a tireless and prolific correspondent and never dull. He expressed love, wonder, and a surprisingly cheerful interest in mundane things and events. He wrote, for example, to Elizabeth Bishop, congratulating her (somewhat self-consciously) on her weight loss, among many other achievements. To Elizabeth Hardwick (second of his three wives) he sent tender and intimately newsy letters - often with an ache.  Randall Jarrell, another friend, received a letter that began \\"Lying awake in bed the other night after my reading, I thought of the joy of seeing you.\\" <br /> <br />Lowell would have loved email: he complains every now and then about the slowness of the mails, especially between the US and Europe. He is by turns thrilling and everyday in these letters, and often tender and loving. <br /> <br />Much has been made posthumously of Lowell's bipolar disorder. It's sad and sweet to read his notes to his mother. After beginning \\"psycho-therapy\\" in the late 1940's he writes to her that \\"I've been trying to understand my first six or seven years, and have many questions to ask you.\\" He is uncynical and open. After her death in 1954 (also documented in letters) he had a psychotic break during which, as ever, he wrote letters. <br /> <br />Editor Saskia Hamilton has arranged these chronologically so you can read them as a sort of a biography. This is a terrific window on Lowell and his world.	2005-08-03

Over the years I've sought out a variety of the classic and not-so-classic examples of the genre, both academic and just for fun. The expression of sexuality Bentley promotes is neither shocking nor abhorrent (millions can attest to this) and her story deserves to be told. <br /> <br />Bentley is a former professional ballet dancer and competent writer and reporter. Her memoir about an intense affair that had as its centerpiece frequent, albeit compulsive (she kept count) anal intercourse seemed like something worth reading.  <br /> <br />Instead of \\"showing,\\" though, Bentley tells - and you understand pretty quickly that Bentley has told her story and explained herself many, many times in many, many therapy sessions. She offers some nuggets of self-analysis that sound very much as if a mental health practitioner came up with them. Her father was cold and difficult to please, pain became a friend, she early on became perfectionist, etc.  One is led to believe that it is a given that an old psychic wound is necessary in order for one to enjoy anal sexuality. <br /> <br />The Freudian punning is unnerving. <br /> <br />There is little dialogue in this story and precious little deep feeling. The guy to whom she insists she surrendered  is called \\"A-Man,\\" a cutesy moniker and far cry from the grave dignity of the Stephens and Sirs of the genre. <br />  <br />This is less an \\"erotic memoir\\" than a series of descriptions - told by the way in the breathy prose of fashion-magazine reportage - of what she wore and how she looked, the state and the size of genitalia,  and where to buy the supplies most cheaply (Costco), of an affair that while undoubtedly wonderfully physically intense and affecting, sounds surprisingly lackluster in the retelling. I was disappointed in this story. <br /> <br />	2004-10-18

The story begins in the 1880's and ends with the 1924 Immigration Restriction Act, which  severely curtailed further Jewish immigration to the US.<br />James Nottage contributes a Foreword in which he poses the question, Just what is a Westerner? In fact, the American Jewish westward migration was a picture of diversity and variety. Married and unmarried men and women,  entire families, and orphans found their way West, often in reaction to economic conditions in the eastern United States, sometimes because of wanderlust or an urge to farm - or just out of curiosity. <br />Immigrants experienced problems of adjustment and, often,  acute isolation. The early years were often difficult. Community had to be built from scratch.  One boy wrote to a popular newspaper column,\\" I am all alone in this world, and am an orphan and live out here among the cowboys trying to earn an honest livelihood.\\"  Communities in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada,  California, Oregon, Washington were begun, grew, and thrived. <br />Dr. Kahn contributes two essays. The first, \\"Looking at America from the West to the East, 1850-1920's\\"  explores Jewish expectations of economic opportunity: the Gold Rush, the fur trade, and  opportunities in mercantilism and agriculture. Hasia Diner's \\"American West, New York Jewish\\" explores picture of the West as drawn by Easterners, and includes a remarkable \\"Map of the United States in Yiddish,\\" first published in 1912 in the book \\"Guide to the United States for the Jewish Immigrant,\\" by John Carr, and published under the auspices of theConnecticut Daughters of the American Revolution.<br />Agriculture, the building of community, politics, culture, inevitable class tensions, anti-Semitism, and the various roles of women are explored at length in this exhibition as in its  catalog. The names - of people, congregations, and businesses -  are here, too. Historical societies and families have provided archival material.  Along with seventy illustrations there are census data, notes, and a good index in this smart and moving tour of the historic Jewish American West.<br />In his Afterword historian M. Rischin asserts that the mandate of the Autry Museum was to \\"divest the history of the American West of its bunkum and hokum.\\" This book succeeds handily.	2002-09-06

She remembers her Catholic childhood. She had a lively inner life,  kept scrapbooks, and as an adult has led an unusual and enthusiastic sexual life. She has been in favor of men of all shapes, nationalities, classes, colors, ages, and sizes occupying her body (if not her mind) for a few moments, an evening, or an entire relationship. But this book is not about \\"relationships.\\"  Think of these four essays (\\"Numbers,\\" \\"Space,\\" \\"Confined Space,\\" and \\"Details\\")   as theory and  criticism - not of art, but of desire and pleasure -rather than confession or apology. She's very smart, and she is not showing off. The images are vivid. She observes and describes an enormous variety of remembered  sexual acts and subjective inner states. She deconstructs pleasure most satisfyingly. She explores the \\"why\\" of her pursuit, too. Millet lets readers in,  but only if they are wise enough to read between the lines. <br />Millet the enthusiastic participant was appreciative of bodies, desire, and earthly pleasure. She wanted connection and intensity, and clearly she craved company. Male bodies and male desire - along with her own -  were  the way to get it. She explains right off that she is submissive. This is key to understanding her story.  She underwent some pain in the service of her desires, too.  There's no shame here; in fact, she is refreshingly accepting.  She is calmly reflective regarding \\"dirty words,\\" asserting that their use during anonymous sex serves \\" to fuse us all together and to accelerate the annihilation of the senses that we are all trying to achieve in those moments.\\"<br />There emotion in her story, but it is screened at times, and it is unsoftened by love or romance, and free of guilt. Millet was, she claims frankly, not a seductress; she was simply available. It seems, too, that she was kind. Men were, too. There is frequently tenderness. Millet describes the feeling she loves:  that she is literally disappearing into pleasure. <br />At least one Renault and a Citroen Deux-Cheveux are in this book, too, along with YSL and other good French clothing.  The French are loyal to their cars and their designers.<br />Why did Millet write this book?   Certainly not for any of the reasons  that American readers might prefer, such as \\"healing,\\" \\"recovery,\\" or some plea for social or religious absolution. She does not recant. Millet's lack of apology or contrition and her frank self-revelation might inflame readers who are confused by her stance and her presentation. This book is neither \\"erotica\\"  nor anguished memoir. Instead, it's four essays on an unconventional life. Millet as tour guide tells all, shows all, and, finally, asks a variety of good questions.  I found myself thinking quite a lot, and greatly enjoying Millet's approach to her account of an astonishingly unconventional sexual life.	2002-08-03
US	51725472	R2P27HRFTEZGG3	0375400273	598144362	The Fly Swatter: How My Grandfather Made His Way in the World	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Gerschenkron's world	Growing up Nicholas Dawidoff had a talkative and demonstrative larger-than-life maternal grandfather who had lived in, to paraphrase the Chinese curse,  interesting times: his home town Odessa during the Russian revolution and Vienna (where he had to start over, learning German as a student) during the rise of Nazism. Alexander Gerschenkron (called Shura) had married a fellow student, Erica Matschnigg,  in Vienna, whom he would deem &quot;perfect,&quot; and who was his lifelong intellectual sparring partner.  To save their lives they emigrated to the US. After a time Shura found work at UC Berkeley, The Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC,  and then at his favorite place ever: Harvard.  In addition this brilliant and cultured grandfather was kind and funny, educated, eccentric, and more than willing to act as a sort of a dad for his grandson, whose own father was mentally ill. <br />The one thing, though that Gerschenkron couldn't, or wouldn't, provide for family, friends, or colleagues - or his beloved and loving grandson -  was so much as a shred of concrete information about his childhood, his youth, and anything remotely resembling his feelings. No one got into his inner life, and those who tried (and there were many) learned that it was at all times off-limits.  So this book is a memoir but also a work of informed conjecture and detection.<br />Dawidoff, an insightful man and a compassionate reporter,  draws a careful and reasoned portrait, &quot;a biographical memoir, a work of reconstruction&quot;  that is a pleasure to read. The &quot;dismal science,&quot; economics, has never seemed so vitally important and downright interesting as it does in this book. <br />Gerschenkron was hyperactive; he gave up reading the newspaper in middle age, citing the number of books he had yet to read and reasoning that the time the papers took from this was objectionable. He loved to argue and to win, but he was courtly, too. He practiced what he called &quot;French manners,&quot; combining recognizable rules of  European etiquette with extreme chivalry.  He could be exasperating, but he was generous and possessed  astonishing depth and breadth of knowledge (in many areas, not just economics)  which he more than willingly shared with the world. Gerschenkron developed theories of economic behavior that are classics, now, and some which were of great importance to US policymakers' understanding of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and of developing nations' economic behavior. He was a prolific essayist and loved literature. Rather than read translations, he taught himself entire languages. He worked out chess problems without a chessboard. He was a character, and became something of a curmudgeon in later life.<br />Gerschenkron was also fiercely loyal to certain things - countries, colleagues, ideas, people, and the most ordinary stuff of his life. Dawidoff takes  pleasure in this information, and I did, too Of Shura he writes. &quot;[He] had a party (the Democrats); a team (the Red Sox); a player (Ted Williams); a board game (chess); a breed of dog (Labrador retriever); a flower (pink rose); a lower body haberdasher (he sent to a Vienna tennis shop for white linen trousers); an upper body haberdasher (he ordered his wool plaid lumber jackets and matching caps from a hunting supply outfit in Maine); a brandy; a chocolate bar; an aspirin; a bullet; a pencil; a shaving soap; a foreign bookstore; a domestic bookstore; a barber; a newsstand (he would go miles out of his way to buy his periodicals from Sheldon Cohen at Out of Town News); and a weekly news magazine (L'Espresso).&quot; And of course he had a school, Harvard, which he loved beyond all measure. Gerschenkron's calculus was simple: the US was the best nation on earth, and Harvard its best school. He thrived there. Dawidoff claims that Harvard &quot;made his personality possible.&quot;<br />Gerschenkron dominated people and gatherings and enjoyed contact, but also required anddemanded great blocks of solitude. Sometimes he hurt those he loved. He insisted that his young daughter practice her flute when he wasn't at home, because the sound annoyed him. He disappointed his daughters often and had some stormy relations with friends and colleagues.<br />There's hardly a dull moment in this account of a life and the many lives that Gerschenkron touched, and Dawidoff has provided enough interesting tangential information to serve as jumping-off points for a lot more reading and inquiry.<br />There are Source Notes and Acknowledgements.  The books lacks an index, which is a real shortcoming. There are hundreds of interesting and important people, places, and works of art and scholarship in this book and its publisher ought to have splurged on something so essential as a good index. Gerschenkron (a lover of notes, acknowledgements, appendices, and indices) would agree.	2002-07-08

Weidensaul, an accomplished naturalist who seems also totally comfortable with people,  traveled the globe for this book and he writes that the search for lost species is \\"a good deal more subtle than I'd originally realized.\\" He calls the process of rediscovery \\"the many ways in which the lost come back from the grave,\\" and explains that what at first may seem like the business of biology and science is in fact \\"enmeshed with human psychology, deep-seated desires, and the ways, accurate or imagined, in which we view our world.\\" Later in his narrative he confesses that if he had one crack at a working time machine, he would without a doubt set it for \\"about twenty thousand years in the past.\\" The last Ice Age would have had a terrific reporter in Weidensaul.<br />There is a variety of famous and not so famous little-known and in some cases \\"extinct\\" creatures (Bachman's Warbler on the island of St. Lucia, the ivory-billed woodpecker, the Australian night parrot, the golden toad, and more) to be written about. Weidensaul delves into theories of hybridization, cloning, and numerous current issues in nature and science. As to the discovery of obscure or assumed-vanished species, he writes that finding an unknown plant or animal is not difficult since \\"the roughly one million species that scientists have named and catalogued may represent only a tenth to a thirtieth of the planet's total biota.\\"  For example, never-before catalogued species of birds emerge from the famously shrinking tropics at the rate of one or two per year.<br />His stories combine reportage and layman's science with historical narrative. The writing, sometimes about complicated matters, is delightfully clear;  you would be thrilled to find it in a good magazine that publishes high-quality nonfiction pieces of some length. He explains some of the bravery, hunches,and wonderfully educated guesswork, along with incredible heroism and pluck, that the scientific and naturalist communities have shown in the search for \\"lost\\" species.  The author is present, but never the center of attention. He's a naturalist and a reporter;  his stories are bracing and exciting. Weidensaul's grasp of issues in nature, science, the mysteries of lost species and the people who fight to find them is firm. There are notes, a bibliography, and 15-page index.	2002-06-17

Men's magazines (in contrast to women's)  have traditionally shorted men on information about their sexual organs. Gilbaugh writes that for years patients asked the same questions, and he wished that he could hand them (and their partners) a book that would supply them with what he feels is basic information that is really essential to health and peace of mind. <br />Gilbaugh has set things right in this book. He is compassionate regarding the worries that patients live with and bring to him. Problems of impotence,penis size, the varieties and causes of erectile dysfunction, vasectomy, the prostate, the bladder, anomalies of the penis and testicles, issues specific to aging, STDs and other dangers and problems are discussed. Gilbaugh addresses drug treatments and surgical procedures (including a section on \\"Avoiding the Knife\\"), cancers of the male reproductive organs, Viagra, AIDS, penis function, infections, dysfunction and more.<br />Gilbaugh has an easy approach and is informative but not particularly sciencey. He even quotes Winston Churchill on a urology topic. When asked by an impressionable young man for advice upon entering His Majesty's diplomatic service, the great man \\"pursed his lips for a moment, then replied. 'Young man, never pass up the opportunity to take a leak.'\\"<br />This is an informative, quick, and elegantly simple book. If you leave it around, the man of the house just might pick it up and read it from cover to cover, and that would be a very good thing.	2002-06-14
US	51725472	R1WBZRCICCBSTU	0316150487	925598518	The Perfect Store: Inside eBay	Books	5	12	14	N	N	The how and why of a terrific idea	The legend of Internet auction site eBay's birth is irresistible: a smart young guy starts it so that his girlfriend, who collects PEZ dispensers, can find more. Pam Wesley, Pierre Omidyar's fiancée, did want more PEZ dispensers in 1997, but in fact this creation myth was dreamed up by AuctionWeb's (later eBay's) Mary Lou Song, who pitched it to Omidyar, reasoning later that \\"No one wants to hear about a thirty-year-old genius who wanted to create a perfect market.\\" <br />The boyfriend, Pierre Omidyar, was born in Paris in 1967, and moved to the US as a six-year-old. He grew up in Washington, DC in a home that prized brain power and education. (His father's a medical doctor, and his mother has a doctorate in linguistics.) He loved computers early on, and snuck out of PE in order to tinker with his science teacher's cheap Radio Shack computer in a school closet, eventually teaching himself to program in BASIC. <br />But this was no asocial loner/misfit writing code in a closet. Author Adam Cohen draws a portrait of the young Omidyar as a dyed-in-the-wool humanist and idealist, a brilliant programmer who was also a sociable and thoughtful young man who fully believed that cyberspace ought to be about people and community. Cohen asserts that Omidyar \\"wanted his corner of cyberspace to be a place where people made real connections with each other, and where a social contract prevailed.\\" Quite deliberately, and with no goal toward making its founder a gazillionaire, Omidyar's idea created, after plenty of tinkering, eBay: \\"a perfect marketplace.\\" <br />Along the way there are evolving business plans, bright and devoted employees, and a consistent and profitable fiscal (though not cultural) conservatism. According to Cohen, eBay's leaders have been very good at recognizing a poor plan and rejecting it. The feedback practices that eBay pioneered - and so many have adopted - are fully described. There's an IPO, and the swelling and the bursting of the dot com bubble. Cohenis careful to contrast eBay with other big dot coms (Amazon most visibly) whose leaders have been seduced by schemes, nearly all of them involving overinvestment in new and unproven online companies, that consistently failed after bleeding millions of investor dollars. Issues of ethics, legality, fraud, plus the inevitable technological challenges of a fast-growing online site are intelligently and colorfully discussed, too.<br />The vast stuff of eBay is in here, too: knickknacks, new and used clothing, cars, furniture, pornography, antiques, books, Barbies and Beanie Bags, art and things you might not have ever thought existed. There are profiles of real characters - told compassionately and well. Cohen has a sense of humor, but he doesn't laugh at people - no matter how unconventional their practices and proclivities. <br />Cohen discusses the comparatively new psychological disorder of cyber addiction. Ebay took an interest in this, and sponsored a forum for users. People wrote to eBay's Mary Lou Song with their stories. One wrote,\\" I love it when I hear my boyfriend snore, because that means he's deeply asleep and I can go downstairs and turn the computer back on.\\" Clinical psychologists treat Internet addiction, and eBay is often - though by no means always - the drug of choice. <br />The editing of this book could have stood some improvement. I wished for chapter headings more colorful than \\"Chapter One,\\" \\"Chapter Two,\\" and photographs would have been a nice plus. The eBay story deserves at least a few good graphics. Some of the book's organization is spotty, too: Chapter Ten is a hodge-podge that would probably defy naming. <br />This is a full and affectionate story about one of our more interesting companies, the fruits of idealism, and (not coincidentally) some great ideas combined with smart business practices. Ebay really IS a community as well as a corporation - and Cohen makes that wonderfully clear. Although the subtitle is \\"Inside eBay,\\" in fact the story begins in Omidyar's adolescence and concludes in 1999, when Omidyar leaves eBay to move to Paris with his wife (of the PEZ myth) and their baby. Cohen likes these people, and I did, too. I came away with a full understanding of what Cohen means by \\"the perfect store,\\" and feeling that I'd gotten to know some of the visionary people and the sort of sociable optimism, brainy hard work and creative thinking responsible for eBay's beginnings and its continuing success.	2002-05-23

Her father left shortly after her birth and she lives with her elderly mother, who is, we are told, old enough to be her grandmother, and her \\"inquisitor and executioner all at once.\\" Her mother has given her all to assuring her daughter's talent: \\"Erika has never had to do housework, because dustrags and cleansers ruin a pianist's hands.\\" The daughter's \\"vocation is her avocation: the celestial power known as music.\\" Erika has a room of her own in their apartment - mostly a place to hide some of her possessions. Mother and daughter sleep in one bed. Her mother expects obedience, loyalty - and Erika's paycheck, which is to help buy them a new apartment. <br />Erika wants a life of her own but has no idea of how to go about getting it. She is repulsed by the fact of her aging and by her femaleness. Love and suffering are inextricably linked. She wanders through Vienna after work and lies to her mother in order to indulge herself occasionally in excursions to peep shows and furtive shopping trips to buy beautiful, well-made clothes which she takes home stuffed in her briefcase - so that Mom won't see. <br />Erika's cacophonous memories of her past sexual episodes with men roil in her head. She is overwhelmed by herself. She cannot feel nor respond to conventional expressions of tenderness and love. She knows what she wants, however, and develops a relationship with a much younger student, Walter Klemmer, in order to get it. <br />This is an amazing novel about an unconventional and unconventionally disturbed woman, the urge to direct one's own suffering, and the consequences of a life so thoroughly dedicated to control and perfection. The descriptions are compact and rich: not a word is wasted. It's a political novel, too: critical of modern bourgeois life. I was mesmerized and disturbed by it, and awed by Jelinek's abilities.	2002-04-27

Shields was a cute baby, a good-looking kid, and is a handsome man - but that's no reason to hold it against him.  <br />Despite the flippancy of the book's title, in fact this is collection of deeply personal essays and informal cultural and literary criticism. Shields is a Professor of English and it's obvious he loves to teach:  he provides a quirky survey course, too.  In the first 45 pages, he cites more than several writers, among them his parents, Walt Whitman, Thomas Wolfe, Steinbeck, Bellow, Hunter S. Thompson (who once called him a \\"pencil-necked geek\\" for doubting some Thompson reportage), Sartre, Shakespeare, Proust, Updike, Nabokov - among others. In addition you quickly catch on that he loves film, and sports, and games, too. He loves to laugh - and is interested in the comics who provoke that laughter.<br />Shields doesn't embarrass easily, but he doesn't want to embarrass others, either.  The piece \\"Properties of Language\\" is an appreciation, and it  reminded me to reread some of my favorite writers. He loves Bill Murray and explains why in \\"The Only Solution to the Soul is the Senses.\\"   Shields  recalls and deconstructs his obnoxious behavior toward a college girlfriend, his relationship to sports (he loves basketball, but would rather watch than play), and a variety of books and authors that have provided him intense pleasure. <br />His stuttering is a topic, too. He explains that his father stammered,  but that as his son he took his dad's \\"halting speech and turned it into a full-blown stutter.\\" Shields got help for his stutter at the University of Iowa, and tells that story, too. He wrote a great piece for his father's ninetieth birthday, but fear got ahold of him, and he never spoke it. Among Shields' many astonishing and beautiful assertions regarding his dad is this one: \\"He showed me how to love being in my own body, showed me how to love the words that emerged from my mouth and from my typewriter, how to love being myself and not some other self, and this self owes all of that to him.\\" <br />These are essays that are personal, thoughtful, and satisfying.	2002-04-16

He writes that a \\"rosy patina of relentless suburban niceness shimmers on the surface\\" of his childhood. In this terrifically readable account he writes about his parents with compassion. This is not a \\"victim\\" story. \\"My mother was an emotional woman who cried at the drop of a pin. At the drop of a hat. At the drop of a hat pin.\\" He describes her, achingly really, as someone who \\"could make a wild wailing hard-baked baby coo with the soothe of her touch.\\"  He loved his dad - and strives to understand him. Sterry's an adventurer who happens to feel and think deeply, and he's written a thoroughly absorbing adventure story about the nine months he worked as a prostitute in Los Angeles \\"partying\\" with women while he was a freshman in college.<br />He registers for classes and works frying \\"industrial chicken, \\" of which we learn quite a lot.  In a few weeks his boss, a seedy, weirdly friendly guy,  asks him if he's ready for Real Money. Real Money, it turns out, is to be made \\"partying\\" with women.  He won't be a streetwalker, but will be on call. Sterry insists on women only:  \\"I started having  sex when I was thirteen, and I took to it like a well-watered carrot in fertile earth. I'm fluent in Sex. I take direction well. I love making women feel good, and I've learned the importance of a slow hand, a sweet mouth, and paying attention.\\"  He is seventeen.<br />Sterry gets his pager and his instructions which, aside from the instructions regarding pay,  aren't as far from the Boy Scout credo as you might think.  (\\"1. Don't be late. 2. Don't rip anybody off. 3. Don't speak unless spoken to. 4. Be clean. 5. Say as little as possible. 6. When in doubt say even less. 7. The customer's always right. 8. If something seems weird it probably is. 9. GET THE MONEY UP FRONT!\\"). For the next nine months he's a boy toy for pay: $100 an hour, more or less.It's all here. This book is painful and trusting and generous. It's appalling in places, not a turn-on but a page-turner.<br />So how does a seventeen year-old boy do in the sex trade? It seems that he did pretty well. Oh, he trained some. \\"On the first day of my rookie season, Frannie gives me excruciatingly explicit instructions in her droll monotone, detailing exactly what she wants me to do and how she wants me to do it. I'm ready. I was born for this work.\\"  His customers, mostly middle-aged women - among them lonely married women, aging rich hippies, lesbians, the horribly disconcertingly grieving mother of a dead son his age -  were pleased with him.  He is workmanlike, puts forth effort,  and he is kind.   His customers say \\"Please,\\" and \\"Thank you.\\"   He strives to understand not only their physical selves, but the rest of them, too. Best of all, the pay is amazing  ...<br />It turns out that, at least for Sterry, the provocation of the female orgasm is the easy part. The more difficult thing, and the true sticking point,  is the impossibility of living in a way that gives him even a modicum of happiness. His relationships with his peers (specifically Kristy, a coed - in whom he is interested) are strained to the breaking point.  The pager keeps going off, and he can't not obey its call. Lying in the service of the keeping of his secret  is behavior  which feels \\"familiar and familial.\\" It  becomes a way of life. Something's got to give, and after nine months, it does.<br />This is a strange story told easily and well. The  ragged particulars (and often eloquent and heartbreaking throwaway lines) of the daily life of a seventeen year-old boy who happens to be turning tricks for a living while attending college are no small thing. Sterry intersperses  trenchant and interesting vignettes from his childhood and the ongoing drama of his parents' troubled lives. It works well. The precocious and energetic boy \\"for rent\\" has clearly grown up to be a man who is smart and wise and compassionate This is a terrific read.	2002-04-05
US	51725472	R2RYGZDDI81PAS	0465028446	558802515	A Memoir Of No One In Particular	Books	5	13	17	N	N	Sit-down comedy and much, much more	Daniel Harris is a clear thinker, a hilarious raconteur, a Ph. D. dropout (and therefore consigned to \\"the Gulag of the intelligentsia\\"), a gay man in his forties,  a cultural critic, a student of sex and semiotics, literature and media and all things pop. He's his own best source of jokes and - in his latest effort - a thoroughly engaging  and an intensely thoughtful autobiographer.  The title, the subtitle, the flyleaf and the introduction  (\\"Beginning\\") posture a disdain for the craft of memoir.  Don't you believe it. Harris is great at the art of remembering, of retelling rivetingly well,  and - best of all -  of making some sense of his life up 'til now.  His story as he tells it is by turns sad and serious, wonderfully sensitive, harsh (toward himself)  in places and sweetly sympathetic in others. It's also hilarious. It's likely that you'll laugh uncontrollably in places. I tried to read this while eating and nearly choked on my food.<br />In a dozen intensely personal and readable chapters - among them \\"Writing,\\" \\"Dressing,\\" \\"Laughing,\\" \\"Speaking and Listening,\\" \\"Cleaning and Decorating,\\" \\"Lying,\\" \\"Reading,\\" and others on sex and sexual preferences and practices, Harris generously hosts a tour - of his past, his present, and himself. He doesn't stint on self-criticism, either. In fact, he pathologizes his often quite harmless behaviors sometimes. Does he not know that hardly any men throw out old T-shirts? He has not talked to wives, for he seems to think there's something abnormal about his masculine habit of saving his worn-out clothes, calling it \\"my irrational tendency to hoard superannuated garments.\\" You will laugh.<br />Harris grew up in \\"a liberal, middle class family,\\" his father an accomplished Jewish academic and then a psychotherapist and his mother \\" a disaffected Southern Baptist, a country girl.\\" He's appalled at some of his family tree - specifically, the Southern Baptist branch that lynched a black man. When he told his dad he was gay, his father thought it might be curable, and offered his son a home version of electro convulsive therapy. Harris smartly refused. <br />Sometimes it seems that he is his own worst enemy - but he's  also his own best friend.  He loves to shop, he can't afford expensive stuff, and his reportage is hilarious. He wants to be alone (needs to - in order to read and to write),  and also longs for contact and communion. Life can be hard, and he tells you why. His lifelong best friend, a man named Philip, was killed tragically in Lebanon.  He is \\"obsessed with straight men,\\" and envies what he imagines is their easier lives, free of the fetishes and compulsions that Harris assumes are the ken of gay men. He loves conversation, and he's doubtless very good at it -  but it distresses and disappoints him, because it is so inferior to his written words. But talk he must, and he deconstructs his conversational style (\\"I pour on the plain American accent so unconvincingly that at times my voice cracks like a prepubescent boy's, the mellifluousness of the elegant gay man giving way to the abrupt, hard-boiled delivery of a character out of a Raymond Chandler novel.\\") - along with dozens of other parts of his life. He writes about sex and his own proclivities, and traverses the complicated terrain of his own desires in intensely personal ways.<br />These are great autobiographical essays that are history, confession, and successful self-examination. Despite his protestations to the contrary, Harris is a brave and trusting man. In this self-deprecatingly titled book he's trusted his readers with his life. It's an act of faith, and of love. I enjoyed it thoroughly.	2002-04-03

Without one, the other loses form - and meaning. Each and both are his focus here, and he manages in this book to ably wear two hats: that of an enthusiastically literary (he read English as an undergraduate) psychotherapist, and also an essayist on literary topics who is - not at all by accident - unapologetically psychoanalytically-oriented. He is playful and he writes with clarity and precision. You never puzzle out a Phillips sentence; you reread because you were pleased the first time. In addition his clinical experiences (as a child psychotherapist) inform some of the pieces.<br />Sometimes he is elegantly simple - to set the hook, and is almost epigrammatic, as when he asserts, &quot;One way of describing growing up would be to say that it involves a transition from the imperative to the interrogative - from 'Food!' to 'I want' - to 'Can I have?'&quot; In addition, the Phillips knack for successfully and bracingly arguing both sides of a story is out in full force. <br />Some of the subjects under discussion are poetry and psychoanalysis; narcissism (not such a bad thing); anorexia nervosa; clutter (as &quot;the obstacle to desire&quot; and the &quot;object of desire&quot;); agoraphobia; poet Frederick Seidel's one book of published poems; grief and melancholy; jokes, and an appreciation of Martin Amis (which jauntily starts out, &quot;For three words once, in 1987, Martin Amis sounded like D.H. Lawrence.&quot;) Several (among them &quot;Christopher Hill's Revolution and Me&quot;) are autobiographical, and all are thoroughly engaging. <br />There are 28 essays. Some are book reviews. Some discuss writers or thinkers I'd never read. One of Phillips' abilities is to reference someone with whom you are unfamiliar, and make that person come alive in the course of the essay. You will not be lost, or lose interest.<br />You candip into this book, come back to it, skip around, or steam through it. Phillips is flexible, and so is this collection. From Phillips' essay on American psychotherapist and essayist Leslie Farber, in which he mentions Farber's writing style: &quot;Out of languages at odds with each other, if not actually at war with each other - the languages of Freud, of Sullivan, of Buber; of autobiography, of existentialism, of phenomenology, of a too-much-protested-against romanticism - Farber has found a way of being at once easily accessible to his readers, and surely but subtly unusually demanding of them.&quot; Phillips was also describing himself.<br />A very worthwhile book.	2002-03-14

I was grabbed by its first description, and held closely throughout. McEwan has created characters who are so fully realized that I felt as if I had known them for years. It's an amazing story, though not at all far-fetched.  It's slyly easy to read - think \\"page-turner\\" - but it is about vitally important things. In addition considerable historic research went into it, and that's a delicious plus.<br />McEwan invites you into an English world that you will smell, hear, feel, and taste - and your mind and emotions will be fully engaged.  The family has money and servants but this is nothing you've seen on television or the movies. The story is told with discipline and control, and  from several points of view. The people are palpably real. It's a tightly organized and  satisfying assemblage of the things that matter, among them family life, childhood, debt and obligation, loyalty, imagination, faith and hope, innocence and guilt, love, desire,  varieties of destruction -  and the urge to make a difference. Finally: war and peace. (In fact, you might be reminded of Tolstoy in more than a few ways.) In addition it's a fierce and moving meditation on  the life of the mind and creativity.  At the same time, McEwan's powers of description are such that all of your senses are never anything but fully engaged. English country life in the 1930's - a heat wave, and the fragrance of wildflowers, the feel of a silk dress that is sticking to skin, the thick dark of a moonless summer night - through  the horrors of the Second World War (Dunkirk most dramatically and effectively) and beyond. It is either sheer brilliance, or a deeply humane urge, or maybe just a workmanlike sense, but McEwan takes full responsibility for each of his characters- and sees them through to the end.<br />Nearly every page has something unselfconsciously remarkable to think about - or to reconsider. I used my pencil throughout; there is so much that is wise or just plain awe-inspiring in this book.  McEwan has accomplished something amazing. I'm telling friends to read the book first, reviews second.  The story is so terrific, and so moving and important -  and might unfold best for the reader who comes to it blissfully uninformed. It's not very often that I've felt transformed by a novel.  Read it as soon as you can.	2002-03-13

His past wanderings have taken him into the vagaries and varieties of the language of erotics, which he tackled enthusiastically - with a thesaurus, no less. The subject of beards is one that he admits he had never given much thought until one morning a few years ago.<br />His interest was piqued, he says in his introduction to this delightful book, in \\"one of those perverse moments of inspiration.\\" Walking to work in downtown Toronto, \\"rather than indulging my own thoughts as usual,\\" he started noticing faces, and he then noticed that more than a third of the males were in some fashion bearded, soul patched, sideburned, mustachioed -  and so it began. He wanted to uncover the meanings of facial hair, the \\"unconscious reasons\\" that men grew and tended beards,  and even the \\"ritualistic symbolism of shaving.\\" He wondered what women thought about beards.  His survey expanded to his colleagues, his psychotherapy patients, and strap-hangers on the Toronto subway. (You might guess that he asked his friends, too.) He was off and running.<br />This marvelous and generously-illustrated book is the result of his considerable ability to tackle his subject with energy, brainpower, humor and a sense of fun. It's a documentary, a history, a survey, an appreciation, and a catalogue. There are hundreds of black and white illustrations, and topical quotations from famous and not so famous beard-wearers.  Chapter 6 deals with the (usually) unwanted thing:  \\"The Feminine Beard.\\" The  compulsory beard (the Taliban being a recent and dramatic example of mandatory beardedness) is examined, too - in a chapter on religious beards. There's a \\"Timeline of Queer Facial Hair\\" among other remarkable bits of information in the chapter \\"The Gay Beard.\\" <br />Facial hair's inevitable products and labors (shaving cream, razors, clippers, trimmers, and more) are included. Chapter 13, \\"The Personal Beard: Grooming Strategies\\" is a sort of owner's manual. If Great-grand-dad is no longer around to show you how to strop a razor, you can use Peterkin's instructions.<br />There are a lot of useful addresses and websites listed at this book's end (even \\"Where to Order False Facial Hair\\" should you need some), an extensive bibliography but, unfortunately, no index. Nonetheless this is a delightful book that is comprehensive and smart -  and also a lot of fun. I know that I won't look at or think about facial hair in quite the same way ever again.	2002-02-19

Books	4	340	382	N	N	Laughing on the outside	Michael Moore is a muckraker, an American original, and a versatile and funny man. He has written a noisy and important book. Despite its jokey title, it's about lots more than &quot;stupid white men.&quot;  Moore is righteously indignant about out current American state of affairs: the huge disparity between rich and poor, racism,  pollution, unemployment, sinking educational standards, women's issues, American violence and media culture. (When he likes someone or something, you know it, too.). He supports his opinions with facts and figures.  Helpfully, he includes specific instructions to readers who might want to contact their Congressional Representative (an act that Moore asserts can be quite effective), organize in their own communities, and intelligently make a difference.<br />Moore's  first and easiest target in this book is the current administration and, in his view, wholly illegitimate ascendancy to the Presidency of George W. Bush. Moore is irate about what he views as Bush's appalling lack of &quot;Presidential&quot; qualifications, his untruthfulness regarding his past, and his vast array of family and financial connections.  Moore's  retelling of the stealing of the election, via the delivery of the Florida vote before the election ever took place (by the pre-Election day illegal disenfranchisement of thousands of Democratic voters) will shock readers. Although ignored by US media when it broke,  it is factual, and it is appalling.<br />Moore's style, unfortunately, is part student activist and part class clown. This clash of roles is at times a hindrance to his effectiveness. He is funny, and he loves to kid around,  but at times his humor is slapstick - which didn't always work for me. He sometimes tends toward sarcasm, or volume (he will use all caps, for emphasis) which isn't really necessary given the importance of his message. In addition, disconcertingly, the book's tone changes midway through.  In the first half Moore supplies the reader with a variety of important lists: &quot;How to Stage the Countercoup,&quot; a sensible how-to for community organizers; &quot;Survival Tips for White America,&quot; which is a serious discussion of ways to end racism; and the useful &quot;Guide to Student Rights.&quot; Inexplicably, though, halfway through this book his lists change, and become jokey. &quot;How to Use Less Gas,&quot; for example, has among its bullet points &quot;Siphon gas from parked cars at airports,&quot; &quot;Hitchhike,&quot; and &quot;Live in your office or place of work.&quot; His chapter on gender issues is very funny, but I'm not quite sure why it's in the book.  He is serious, but then he jokes at times about surviving global warming, recycling, and gender issues, too - at the expense of his thesis, which is that things are messed up and badly need changing if the people (_all_ the people) of the US are to thrive.<br />This an important book with more than several  messages toward advancing an old institution Moore thinks is definitely worth saving: American democracy. &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; is deadly serious in places, and funny in others, and well worth reading.	2002-02-19

He was, she writes, a pioneer and an utterly original thinker and writer who contributed amply to our present-day notions of the forms and possibilities of literature. In her view Freud virtually \\"fathered the creative writing class\\" by legitimizing not only subject matter but writing forms that had hitherto been considered unsuitable for public consumption. From Freud we inherited new literary forms for self-revelation, self-discovery, and confession.<br />Chamberlain shows how Freud devised \\"the \\"double-well,\\"  an \\"artistic form with a moral component,\\" a new way to tell a story in which \\"a dream sits on the divide.\\" His stories about his patients have more in common with contemporary novellas than the medical case histories of their time, extending at times \\"a typical Freudian invitation to the reader, to pull the [...] thread and see where it leads.\\" <br />Chamberlain examines Freud positively without minimizing his shortcomings. \\"Freud was not a model of tolerance by today's standards, \\" she writes, and cites his views on homosexuality, women's sexuality (on which she says he was \\"underinformed\\"). Nonetheless, Chamberlain writes that Freud \\"gave us a more relaxed attitude toward sex, freed from values of God and the soul, and gender, and divorced from insensitive stereotypes.\\" This is, then, no small thing.<br />Chamberlain has accomplished an unusual and stimulating combination of biography, literary analysis, intelligent conjecture, and thrilling narrative. Her writing is crystal-clear, she tackles complicated things, and explains them wonderfully well.  Freud's wide-ranging creative and personal relationships to philosophy, the visual arts, poetry, nature, music are explored. Along with a good index and bibliography, here are over a hundred pages of fluid and impossible-to-resist (because so interesting and energetic) \\"Notes, Arguments, and Explanations.\\"<br />Well worth reading.	2002-02-16

It's an inventive sort of a ghost story (&quot;wooooo-hooooo&quot; is, believe it or not, used often in this novel) with commentary on love, childhood, and memory. Contemporary English life and political musings are everpresent: TV, movie stars, contemporary economics and more. There are no memorable characters, but there is some suspense. Smith uses stream-of-consciousness in places, but it comes off as a kind of authorial laziness - rather than a way to arrive at psychological truth or meaning. But what ultimately hamstrings this novel the most is the sloppy diction, careless word choice, and the dire need for editing - or at least a critical reader, pre-publication. <br />Early on in this novel Smith's narrator muses about the feel of &quot;a mouthful of dust.&quot; The experience is more visual than tactile, though - and unconvincing. She doesn't feel it, and neither will you.  Elsewhere, a reflection &quot;looms,&quot; &quot;misshapen and small.&quot; A woman enters a room in which &quot;clear and plastic, was the smell of new computer.&quot; A Booker nomination ought not to beg the reader for a red pencil.<br />It's hard to get excited about a novel that asks one to forget about language's meaning (and potential to thrill) as often as this one does.	2002-02-08

Cattrall's an actress, though, and has a different life story altogether - which should not be news to anyone who loved Marcus Welby, MD, for example - and struggled with the fact that actor Robert Young was not, in fact, a doctor. <br />In this book Cattrall and her new husband, handsome jazz musician Mark Levinson, have collaborated to present their inarguable philosophy of communication, honesty, and love, plus their assortment of fail-safe techniques for attaining what is ardently desired but (according to Cattrall) can be elusive for heterosexual couples: female orgasm. Cattrall begins with the truth of her past: twenty years of sexual unhappiness, remedied only recently by her new husband, Levinson. Readerly expectations are set at \\"high.\\"<br />It's all-around good advice: communication, enthusiasm, honesty, and a work ethic are recommended. Oral sex is mapped and described. Diversity is honored, but anatomy trumps, and is carefully explained.<br />There are beautiful, strong drawings  - albeit with instructive and probably sensible red arrows, lines, and various markers - showing precisely what needs to be where in order to succeed at the provocation of the female orgasm.  But it is more craft than art that is illustrated and promoted. It's a \\"how-to,\\" a series of road maps. Often there is more to getting there than asking for (and following) directions - but the Levinsons do not address that issue<br />This is earnest stuff, it means well - but aside from the lovely drawings, and the thrill of hearing from Kim Cattrall,  it's not all that different from other, similar books on the shelf.	2002-01-28

In this story two immigrant Indian women, Sudha and Anju, cousins, are enmeshed in the making of American lives and in the work of living with passion and commitment - with parents, children,  men, with one another and, most importantly  of all, in their own skins. Their compelling story and that of a lot of their friends and relations is told with confidence and grace.<br />Cultures do not so much clash as interweave in Divakaruni's version of events. This works well at times, and not so well at others. Along with compassion and intelligence, she also has a terrific ear and eye for the things of American culture, and a sense of their place in her characters' consciousnesses and everyday lives: from Sweet 'n Low, Cocoa Krispies, Grohe bathroom fixtures, designer perfumes and labels to cars and the &quot;right&quot; neighborhoods, mostly around San Francisco. Her characters are believable and passionate. There is love and romance, hope (dashed and sustained)- and righteous anger at times. The story is easily visualized (as is the screenplay) and it moves at a fast clip.<br />Occasionally she tends to overdo.  Divakaruni's short stories are comparatively spare, and in this novel she sometimes uses a metaphor or a simile when a simple declarative statement would have sufficed. <br />This is a full and satisfying story about interesting people leading passionate lives. Definitely worth reading.	2002-01-17

He didn't want, he says, to &quot;start at the bottom,&quot; and he wondered how working directors he admired had, in fact, gotten their starts. He had loads of questions - and decided to ask them - for himself and on behalf of the many people who have wondered the same things. This book is the result of Jarecki's good idea.<br />Jarecki's questions tend to focus on early influences, the educational and life experiences of the directors, and afford elegant ways into the personalities and attitudes of his subjects. The material is fresh and personal, and makes for great reading. Kimberly Peirce, who directed &quot;Boys Don't Cry,&quot; tells a heartrending story of how she came to want to tell the Brandon Teena story. Barry Sonnenfeld compares directing to being a father, since in his view much of directing is &quot;about consistency and love and hugging.&quot; Amy Heckerling generously gives credit to people who helped her along the way - including the friend who taught her to drive (no small thing) once she had moved from NY to LA. Part of what makes this book such satisfying reading is that Jarecki has somehow managed to collect interesting, lively, and quirky details from each and every director he interviewed.<br />Jarecki is smart and humane, and he doesn't show off. He's done something special here. In these interviews he listens actively and intelligently, with restraint and subtlety. One of the best things about these interviews is that they are quite specifically about work and love (and sometimes, luck) - not stardom. These are interesting autobiographies that afford keen insight into the motives, the practice, and process of directing. As it turns out, passion and good writing are two keys to good directing - and nearly all of these directors credit a good script (sometimes their own) first and foremost.<br />In addition there is brief biographical material, a photo of each director, filmographies, and a good index. A first-rate book.	2002-01-09

Chris Kilham writes interestingly and well, and one's attention is riveted to his stories and opinions. The biggest problem with this book is that there are no footnotes and no endnotes. Kilham offers a lot of stunning notions, but does not cite his sources. For example, in his chapter on decaf, in his view &quot;coffee interruptus,&quot; he asserts that the rate of suicide is higher among drinkers of decaf than drinkers of caffeinated coffee. Citation, please!<br />Read this book for its stimulating opinions and lively patter and a sort of pop-sci approach to its subjects. According to its author, this book is intended as a reference work. It's fun to page through, but in order to be a convincing reference work it needs the added muscle of citations and a bibliography.	2001-12-27

It seems that a working knowledge of high levels of testosterone can teach us quite a lot. (Women, proceed with caution!)<br />Unfortunately, she neglects other factors (and there are so many that make up human choices in love and sex: psychology, for example - and whether or not a couple has a single thing besides the kids to talk about after twenty-five years of marriage) that for me the information loses any authority it might have had.<br />In addition, she has an ax to subtly grind, and it is that men and women in their fifties (and older) have the very best chance for sexual compatability - for a set of specific chemical and biologically determined reasons. This information would seem to argue for couples staying together, but as we know, there are many other factors beyond sexual compatability (which is often fully present in couples who are literally coming apart - in every other way)  that must contribute to couples' happiness - not to mention fidelity.<br />This book has interesting information about biochemicals' influence on our sex and love lives. You will doubtless recognize yourself and your mate in some of her descriptions, but as science it should be taken with a large grain of salt.	2001-12-14

This beautifully produced book consists of six compulsively readable chapters and hundreds of illustrations. I couldn't put it down.<br />In the first chapter &quot;Steel and Whalebone: Fashioning the Aristocratic Body&quot; Steele provides an overview of corseting. An &quot;essential element of fashionable dress for over 400 years,&quot; the corset nonetheless was oftentimes condemned, perceived by historians and some contemporary thinkers  as an 'instrument of torture,' an accessory to the sexual exploitation of women.<br />Steele has studied her subject deeply and widely, and so can confidently object to simplistic rejections of the practice of corseting, its heir tight-lacing (no waist is ever small enough, in the views of the women who practiced this), and other attempts at female self-modification,  asserting that, in fact, it &quot;was a situated practice that meant different things to different [women] at different times,&quot; and that &quot;the corset also had many positive connotations - of social status, self-discipline, artistry, respectability, beauty, youth, and erotic allure.&quot; <br />The history, economics, and sociology of the Renaissance corset are discussed,  along with the corset's unmistakable relationship to the earlier armor of Rome and the middle ages. (The Madonna, wearing a snug laced-bodice dress, one breast bared for her son, was painted by Jean Fouquet in the fifteenth century.) Men were not immune to their own versions of the corset.  &quot;A polished and disciplined mode of self-presentation was important for members of the elite,&quot; with physical self-control uppermost, but in 1588 Michel de Montaigne wrote of female deaths by corseting,  describing the ultimately fatal voluntary modifications of the body that could take (and did) place. Steele points out that corseting wasoften condemned by the medical establishment, but that there is much more to the story. The corset's role in the erotic lives of men and women is undeniable.<br />Steele explores the medical controversies that raged around corseting and tight-lacing, the considerable medical and feminist controversies of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, fashion history, theories of sexuality and politics, and their inevitable intersection. There is fitting and thrilling supporting evidence for a variety of ways to think about the corset,  culled from literature, media, advertising, contemporary accounts, fashion history (Europe, the US, and Africa), studies in sexuality and psychology,  along with examples of the corset in art (paintings of corseted women  Manet, Degas, Seurat, Toulouse Lautrec are reproduced) The corset's historical and contemporary  role in erotics, along with its use as fetish apparel (another area in which Steele is an expert) is thoroughly explored. Fashion photography of this century and Madonna, too.  There is the eventual introduction of latex, the birth of the rubberized girdle of this century, and the ultimate demise all of these tight everyday things, except as openly sexualized accessories,  curios, or ironic artifacts.<br />Finally, Steele discusses women's corseting of the past relative to contemporary ideals of female youthfulness and thinness, some women's enthusiasm for various aspects of self-discipline and alteration,  &quot;the hard body,&quot; along with dieting, exercise regimes that  intend the sculpting of the female body,  and elective surgical practices such as liposuction.<br />There are pages of endnotes, an amazing Bibliography, and a good index.  Great book.	2001-12-10

He's got an eye and an ear for detail, and can comment wryly on marriage (for example) without ever being misogynistic. He writes that he was his Grandma Goldy's  first and favorite grandchild - and that this designation and honor is sticking for life. You will laugh a lot, and admire Maron's ability to sometimes make lemonade out of lemons. In addition, Maron is more than willing to tell us about the silly, sad, and ridiculous jams he has gotten into - and how he found his way out. Maron is not only smart; he is kind and compassionate without ever being maudlin. This memoir, by an American comic with a deservedly bright future, is funny and sweet and well worth reading.	2001-11-27

In addition there are original fables that are suitable for children or adults. Eisenman invites readers into a daunting variety of  Jewish triumphs,  calamities, and inner states, from the beginning of time to 1980's Warsaw. The ordinary and the mythic are honored equally.<br />Eisenmam's deceptively simple &quot;musical word improvisations&quot; are usually a page long. &quot;Apocalypse,&quot; a prose poem on the longing for communion when there seems to be no hope (&quot;Dance with me. Hold me close. Embrace me.&quot;) is a simple, powerful plea. The loneliness of old age in &quot;Tango&quot; (&quot;the bittersweet tango I now dance alone&quot;) is inarguable. <br />Occasionally, Barnett Zumoff's translation falters  (&quot;woven braids&quot; for dreadlocks, for example).  In all, these pieces are well worth reading - for a look at a somewhat experimental Yiddish writer who has a great imagination, generosity of spirit, and an enthusiastic knack for describing his world.	2001-11-14

The author's focus on age fifty and over is sensible, too. She assumes (not unreasonably)that middleaged singles are serious about finding a partner, know themselves reasonably well, and can put this self-knowledge to good use in the writing of a good ad.<br />The author takes a thoughtful and systematic approach; she begins with chapters that invite readers - men and women - to figure out at least the beginnings of who they are, the sort of person they are looking for (an exercise that can save you a lot of wasted ad space, time, and money), and what kind of relationship you are looking for. Refreshingly, she steers clear of sappy &quot;success&quot; stories in favor of useful information (on safety, &quot;red flags,&quot; personal appearance, manners, and more.)<br />Harrison shows you how to write an ad that really expresses who you are, while avoiding pitfalls (such as negativity and too much generality.) She is encouraging and stresses truth-telling, and a positive approach. It's a mini-course in effective self-advertising, and as such it's very useful.<br />I've had some varied experience with Personals and was gratified to read Harrison's book, which reinforced much of what I had suspected. (Men appreciate some friendly personal information, and they are drawn to the word &quot;fun-loving&quot;). In addition Harrison provides useful tips on screening respondents, selecting, meeting, dating. <br />A compassionate, helpful, and very worthwhile book.	2001-11-01

He's savvy regarding semiotics and the arcana (and meanings) of  unconventional sexuality. Fashion, money, and  French and German literature and philosophy are important, too. There are discussions of death and customs around it, and suicide, too.  You will learn more about gems and jewelry than you might have imagined possible (including just why size really does matter, and in the world of gems, what it says about the giver and the wearer). There are hundreds of topics in this story that Klein somehow exhilaratingly ties together, including tattooing and piercing. <br />The narrator has chosen an heir in &quot;Zeem,&quot; a young  woman who will inherit his amazing trove of jewels. He doesn't know her, but he has plenty to tell her, in a variety of registers. He's by turns a fast-talking New Yorker, sometimes professorial, and sometimes almost naïve.  He can be efficient and technical, and sometimes he writes with a luminous clarity and beauty. He talks about his personal sexual history, crossdressing, and the worlds of the transgendered - and jewelry and more jewelry.<br />There's a good variety of methods used (fiction, the essay, and a lot of direct quotation from other sources) to discuss famous women, famous jewelry, theories of gender, sexuality, love, language, style, and money - along with gossip, innuendo, and a lot of information (factual and/or prejudiced) about gems and adornment, and erotics - to make an assortment of points. There's an attention to detail that is sometimes a pleasure, and sometimes (as when discussing each of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands) tedious. <br />This story is much more than a catalogue of great jewelry and is never less than strangely interesting.	2001-10-30

Freud, Brahms, Celtic folklore, Milton Shakespeare, Keats, Yeats, and the British Victorians, too. Even Dr. Strangelove!  We're treated to a grab-bag full of descriptions of customs and practices around separation of the sexes, initiation rites, the vagina, menstruation, marriage,  conception, childbirth, the damp and the wet, daily life,  and inevitable death.  Gilmore spares few details (though he does not include clitoridectomy).<br />What is all of this universal woman-hating about, and where did it come from? Gilmore's not sure. He cites a lot of thinkers, many from anthropology (some, like Chagnon, now discredited). He pays lip service to several psychoanalytic approaches but scant attention to political or economic explanations for misogyny.<br />Gilmore confides toward the end of his book that &quot;many, if not most, of men's feelings about women are a hodgepodge of strongly contrasting impulses, starkly contradictory affects and fantasies.&quot; He clears a path for himself when he asserts that &quot;unlike some who have studied misogyny, I believe this tension-ridden state, not simple hatred or a wish to dominate, accounts for men's denigration of women.&quot; His  social-psych explanation essentially takes a little from here, a little from there. But finally, he theorizes.<br />Men. It is _they_  who have suffered, really - according to Gilmore. Men are afraid of the &quot;femaleness&quot; within. It's hurt them as much as it's hurt women. (Gilmore really says that.)  Men know that they needwomen, but they have &quot;phobias, terrors, fantasies.&quot;  Men suffer from castration anxiety, are afraid of mutilation, have sexual urges at odds with marriage, and just generally have a darn hard time of it.  What, then,  is to be done for the contemporary problem?  Gilmore prescribes &quot;education&quot; and  dads caring for their baby sons more. In conclusion he suggests that &quot;men must get more comfortable with their ambiguous sexuality, their subterranean dependency needs for women's nurturing,  their 'corrupt' feminine side, and their 'poisonous' bisexual self.&quot;<br />This book is more of a big catalogue of bad things, with a feel-good solution for a very few men at its conclusion,  than a deep inquiry into its topic.	2001-10-23
US	51725472	RLSSWSLYQYXW0	1840680539	79044881	I Was For Sale	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Memoir of an appalling and interesting time	Lisa Falour is a former &quot;sex worker&quot; (the term hadn't yet been coined), a  raconteur who is  defiant and glib, jaded and heartbreakingly hopeful all at once. Her humor is deadpan. She has an astonishing story.  Part of the surprise is that she is alive to tell it. This is a dead-on memoir that is informative, sometimes painful -  and intended to inform but not to arouse. <br />A cute, blond Midwesterner,  Falour arrived in  New York in the late 1970's (amidst the &quot;smell of things falling apart&quot;).  Ambitious, not yet educated, and chronically short of money, she enrolled in a succession of colleges, art schools and,  eventually, graduate programs.  She also worked two jobs. At brokerage firms as a secretary or a research assistant,  she wore good suits and heels. In the second job of prostitute and more - the locus of this story - Falour wore often not much more than the standard accoutrements of the sexual galaxy BDSM-  and much higher heels. (Some of her johns preferred her in her office clothes - something she exploited, too.)<br />You may well be appalled at the job description of &quot;bondage model&quot; - as well as the many other things Falour did for money. She was paid to endure pain, and to mete it out. Sometimes she enjoyed herself. She liked drugging and drinking, and did lots of it. The details of what  she calls her &quot;dirty little voyages&quot; take up a lot of this book.  She minimizes the psychic (if not physical) pain of that work by asserting that &quot;the only difference at my secretarial jobs during the day was that I was wearing clothes while men (my bosses) humiliated me.&quot;<br />With unconvincing insouciance Falour claims that the money drove her into it - but then, more convincingly, though not with much elaboration,  she acknowledges that &quot;low self-esteem&quot; was motivation, too.<br />She's impulsive and smart and  self-destructive. She married three men, lived through a series of near-disasters,  and she made a lot of friends, whose portraits she draws with wit and gentle humor.  The story of many of the friendships' unraveling is one of the saddest parts of the book.<br />This is a strange and disturbing memoir that is well worth reading. There's a portrait of a seamy underside of New York City in the late '70's and early 80's that's awfully well drawn. Readers repulsed by honest depictions of  comparatively unconventional sexual acts or tolerance of unconventional behaviors might choose to skip this book. Despite Falour's  claim that &quot; at 41, my spirit is broken, I am alcoholic, and my bouts of depression are now lasting years at a time,&quot; without benefit of writing workshops or thousands of hours of psychotherapy - she has managed to succeed at telling an astonishing personal story.	2001-10-22

There is dialogue that is familiar, tiresome, sometimes funny, hip or dated; and interior monologue that is occasionally moving and important. Franzen can write lucidly about anything and everything, and does so in this very long story. Unfortunately, nothing has been left out.<br />By now the plot is familiar to readers. There's not a lot to it. The pre-publication hype has been intense. A family (two parents, three adult children and several in-laws) is to gather from around the United States for one last Christmas together. This plot requires of the reader an agreement to assign &quot;Christmas&quot; a considerable emotional weight. (Some people really do watch &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; every year.) This will succeed with some, but not all, readers.<br />Parts of the text are nearly soporific. Here's an excerpt, about the matriarch, Enid: &quot;She told not only her friends but everybody else she knew in St. Jude, including her butcher, her broker, and her mailman, that her grandson Jonah was coming for the holidays. Naturally she was disappointed that Gary and Jonah were staying for just three days and were leaving at noon on Christmas, but plenty of fun could be packed into three days.&quot;<br />Is it an important book, and  will it change your way of seeing the world? Probably not. It's 570 pages long. It weighs two pounds. Some of the descriptions of the most commonplace things and inner states seem to stretch on for pages. Parkinson's disease afflicts the family's patriarch, and getting old is no fun, either. Franzen describes how the disease looks to others  but not, really, the experience of the disease. In more than a few places Franzen squanders the chance to go deep, in favor of yet more description of how things looked or sounded. For a novel that uses this much paper and ink to tell its story, the emotional lives of his characters are often frustratingly slight.<br />The visual-details-laden, dialogue-heavy tale of a complicated and somewhat interesting (but also quite average) American middle-class family is a sure draw, but readers old enough to recall the best-selling page-turners of the 1950's and '60's of Leon Uris, James Michener, Jeffrey Archer and even Harold Robbins might not be wowed by this novel. Younger readers new to the genre may well be pleased.	2001-09-26

There are a lot of friends, heart-wrenching and tender hospital scenes, visits to doctors and others who might have a cure, plus nightmares, dreams, and characters and memories out of life and literature. It can be said that for this writer, friends and literature sustained him, and he knew it.<br />The protagonists exert a powerful erotic pull on one another. They are highly verbal people and clear thinkers. Sometimes, though, words fail them.  Some of their exchanges seem almost shocking in their honesty, even harshness. Gottfried (Weiss's name for himself in this)  never loses his desire for Alexander; he says that he never loved him more than at the moment of his death. Not quite defeated, he says simply, even clinically, of his lover's final moments: &quot;In the end life and death were a simple question of oxygen.&quot; <br />This is an unusual AIDS memoir, unsentimental, wholly affecting, and well worth reading.	2001-09-23

She's lived through a lot, and she has a highly developed social conscience. She is concerned about ordinary life, love, war, death, and meaning. In poem after beautifully translated poem, she shows her understanding of the things of this world, the mysteriousness of life, and the things that might matter the most. <br />I reread these poems after the events of September 11th and was astonished to find  so much of use to me in thinking about the unthinkable, really.  In &quot;A Thank-You Note,&quot; she writes &quot;I owe a lot/to those I do not love.&quot; In the incredible &quot;Cat in an Empty Apartment&quot; Szymborska takes a cat's point of view, noting &quot;Something here isn't starting/at its usual time./Something  here isn't happening as it should./Somebody had been here and had been,/ and then had stubbornly disappeared/and now is stubbornly absent.&quot;<br />Szymborska knows that there are not only unimaginable horrors in the world, but also  &quot;miracles,&quot; small truths that are awesome and often wonderful  - not because of any religious or magical event, but because they remind us, once again, of our humanity and of what good things might be possible. She treasures ordinary life,  love, physicality - and communion. Her poems on love (and lovers) are beautiful, and beautifully simple.<br />She cautions against war in &quot;The End and the Beginning,&quot; reminding the reader that &quot;After every war/someone has to clean up./Things won't/straighten themselves up, after all.&quot; She wryly and trenchantly describes war's motives in &quot;Hatred.&quot;  Hatred, she insists, &quot;is not like other feelings,&quot; and &quot;gives birth to causes/which rouse it to life.&quot;<br />Szymborska's vision is one worth taking in, reflecting upon, and learning from. Current events aside, Szymborska's a terrific teacher of poetry. <br />This is a wonderful collection of poems.	2001-09-21

In the course of her research on this book she found that the housewives she had become so curious to learn more about had &quot;left no records at all.&quot; Contemporary Victorian literature, Draznin posits, could not be relied upon to provide the hard data she sought.  She combined information culled from contemporary magazines, &quot;domestic manuals,&quot; and the history of commerce with her knowledge of Victoriana and her &quot;deep familiarity with housewifery&quot; to create her models. <br />Draznin's readable, jargon-free, and to-the-point chapters are each able to stand alone. &quot;Greater London in 1875: A Resident's  View,&quot; provides a portrait of London that is deep and thorough. You can smell it and hear it:  prodigious amounts of manure on the streets, &quot;the deafening noise of traffic,&quot;  and the astonishingly poor air quality that motivated urban dwellers to support the establishment of suburban towns. Many moved out of the city. <br />Family health, contraception, the bearing, rearing and education of children, the managing of servants (protocols were carefully spelled out and, it was assumed, observed), choosing where to live, decorating the home, buying, using, and maintaining the considerable gadgetry (especially the sewing machine) of modern life  all were the housewife's concern. In addition there were spiritual and moral issues that she was expected to manage. Volunteering one's time for helping or nurturing activities was higly socially acceptable, and widely practiced. In addition there are budgets and ledger entries, menus for meals plus teas, and black-and-white illustrations. <br />&quot;The Matron as Her Own Person: Satisfying Personal Needs within and Outside the Home,&quot;  details the considerable industry that grew to serve the needs of the housewife in possession of more free time than ever. Magazines, lending libraries located in bookstores,  (for there were few public libraries, and of them, few were &quot;free&quot; ), visiting, sewing, card-playing, and socializing filled what free time she had. Draznin's high praise, though, is reserved for an activity that was &quot;restful and pleasant,&quot; one that middle-class housewives &quot;engaged in with lady friends in quiet and elegant surroundings that offered many amenities.&quot; Draznin asks rhetorically, &quot;What did she do?&quot; and then answers, &quot;She went shopping.&quot; This reliance on stores combined with the troublesome (to the consumer) quirks of British shopping -- no prices marked on goods, no advertising, snobbishness, and little price competition -- eventually engendered considerable changes in consuming throughout Britain.<br />This is a delightful, accessible,  and well-researched book that will interest students of Victoriana, urban history, and women's history. Young readers will be pleased, too.  There is a lengthy bibliography and a good index. Completely worthwhile.	2001-09-03
US	51725472	R2880GW19SL44J	0374177155	186767040	The Invention of Clouds: How an Amateur Meteorologist Forged the Language of the Skies	Books	5	25	25	N	N	A wondrous story about weather and much more	Until the early nineteenth century, there was no unified system within any scientific or meteorological community for either naming or classifying clouds. The texts produced by nearly all ancient civilizations, the Chinese Shang Dynasty, and in addition Aristotle, Plato, and much later, Descartes, Linnaeus (much too rigidly) and many others had sought to analyze and describe clouds. Hamblyn notes that clouds' observed properties had been variously cited over time in order to reinforce the status quo in politics, philosophy, and religion - or to promote ideas (offensive to Napoleon among many others) about the zodiac, divination, and prophecy. Lamarck had attempted classification of clouds. He published vivid descriptions that were, as it turned out, of no real scientific use.<br />English amateur meteorologist Luke Howard had thought about this problem for quite some time. In 1802 he delivered his address, &quot;On the Modification of Clouds,&quot; to a teeming lecture hall in London. His seven &quot;modifications&quot; of clouds were cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus, cumulus, cumulostratus, nimbus, and stratus. (If you never have been able to memorize the list, you're in good company: contemporary complaints included the gripe that, innovative or not, &quot;the seven 'easy ' names [were] doggedly difficult to remember.&quot;) Despite the Latin, his news was received with great enthusiasm - although there would eventually be controversy regarding nomenclature, with British colleagues urging the use of the mother tongue.<br />Howard described not only the look of clouds, but the specifics of their formation, structure and behavior. His lively audience was captivated by his simple, elegant, and wholly original view, and &quot;by the end of the lecture Luke Howard, by giving language to nature's most ineffable and prodigal forms, had squared an ancient and anxiogenic circle.&quot; Howard had &quot;named the clouds,&quot; and he was the first to have done so.<br />Hissystem was useful to scientists, sailors, poets and philosophers - and just about everyone in between. Coleridge and Wordsworth were enthusiastic. Goethe wrote to Howard. (Howard thought the letter was a hoax, and dispatched a close friend to get to the bottom of it.) Later, Goethe would write poetry on clouds, and Constable would paint them<br />This is an unusual and beautiful book. Hamblyn is a humanitarian and a sensitive and skillful writer. He provides a deeply intimate and sympathetic biography of Howard, a good man for whom fame and celebrity was never the point of his life's work. (He was happy to take time off from science, for example, to tend to his wife and new baby in 1803.). Correspondence and contemporary accounts have been consulted. What could have been a rather dry, even plodding story becomes completely engrossing and full.<br />In addition, there is a thrilling and detailed portayal of the many towns and cities of nineteenth-century Britain (particularly London) that teemed with scientific lectures, &quot;philosophical shows and diversions,&quot; cheering audiences eager to learn more, always more about &quot;every animal, vegetable, mineral known to man, samples of all four elements, and challenges to all six senses, not to mention machines, inventions, and novelties of every kind, were regularly paraded before the eyes of an insatiable and astonished public.&quot; <br />The English scientific community's relationship to the French is explored. One of the many good things about this book is the way that it conveys the immense popular contemporary enthusiasm for science, technology, and innovation in nineteenth- century Britain. Hot-air ballooning, advances in the understanding of the properties of wind, fog, rain, and microclimate, Arctic exploration, and dozens of major and minor figures in the history of science are compellingly described and discussed. The meteorology is clear and requires little more readerly background than would a good look at the Weather Channel. There are good endnotes and a good index. In every way this book is a wonderful read, utterly accessible, and full of contagious passion for its very interesting subject.	2001-08-24

A boy: his family, his childhood and adolescence, and his present life, which veers between feeling like too much (&quot;I'm an apple with a razor inside&quot;) and too little - each and every day.<br />Protagonist Alexander Vine is adored by his mother, who has told him &quot;If anything happened to you, my life would be over.&quot;  He has problems with his father (he cannot bear to hear him eat). He goes to summer camp and gets  poison ivy. He plays in the woods with friends as a child. He totals the family car playing &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; with a buddy.  He loves his great-aunt, and mourns the loss of his grandfather. He's afraid of a lot of things.  He's afraid of germs, but likes bums, drunks, and street people very much.<br />The adult Vine at times can barely get out the door. &quot;I spent the whole day moving in and out of consciousness between naps and reveries, counting the hours until the free phone-sex message would change.&quot; He recalls the details of a wholly conventional and loving middle-class family and upbringing (sometimes with a lot of humor). He frequents peep shows and prostitutes. He is a good friend to his friends. Sex with both men and women  (and there is a lot of it in his story) means everything and nothing to the protagonist: excitement, anticipation, surrender and the hope of communion,  an escape from boredom. But the event never quite succeeds the way he hopes that it will. He wants passion and love - and never gives up hope.<br />Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Crack-Up,&quot; these interesting pieces vary in length and in mood, are arresting and varied, are either autobiographical or not, and together form a terrifically cohesive whole. I enjoyed this novel very much.	2001-08-23

In addition it includes serious and well-thought-out discussions on the meaning of food to humankind.<br />Camporesi, a Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Bologna,  informs the reader in his first essay, &quot;Bread and Death: Food and Peasant Rituals in Italy&quot; of something that may come as a surprise: &quot;the fearful threat of famine continued to hang over people's lives until the middle of the nineteenth century,&quot; and what is thought of today as the &quot;Italian national diet&quot; was in fact a late nineteenth- century invention. Before then,  the peasants of Italy were frequently hungry, &quot;thrift was the iron law of the table,&quot; people lived frugally on some bread, maybe a little wine, greens and root vegetables, maize and chestnuts, snails and frogs, fish occasionally, a little pasta, very little fruit, and very little meat. Dairy products and eggs were limited to what one's one animal (or much less frequently, animals)  could produce.<br />Industrialization contributed greatly and decisively to the expansion of the Italian diet, and what we think of today as Italian food owes much to the ninteeeth century's embrace of railroad and steamship.<br />Camporesi has an unromantic and passionate interest in the social history of the Italian peasantry. In &quot;The Two Faces of Time: The City Calendar and the Country Calendar&quot; he explores the myths and ritual of the clock and the calendar, and his focus on the diet and practices of the peasantry threads through each essay. <br />An essay of particular interest to students of food history, food geography, meaning and ritual is &quot;Dietary Geography and Social History,&quot; a remarkable study which includes a discussion of the geography of fats and oils (no small thing in a country that is the  world's largest exporter of olive oil). There are essays on the contrasts between city and country cooking, and  bourgeois cooking in the nineteenth century. One of Camporesi's pet topics, &quot;Shopping for Food&quot; includes a plea to &quot;touch, sniff, handle, and swallow.&quot; He rejects grocery-store modernization and standardization  (and food as status symbols), and wants food to be sustenance and sensual essential, &quot;the umbilical cord that must never be cut.&quot;  Food is too important, he asserts,  to ever be &quot;still life.&quot; <br />There is much to this careful and scholarly book that will thrill and educate, as well as surprise.  There's a glossary of Italian food names, a bibliography (most of the books are in Italian only, though),  many pages of endnotes, and a good index.  Great stuff.	2001-08-22

He is a raconteur, and writes about sex a lot. Puberty arrived late for him, and he still frets about size - even the size of his nose (too big, he says).  He's been a model, but thinks he's ugly. He doesn't ever have much money.  He worries about flatulence, and is beset by constipation (for which he takes a fiber supplement) and stomach troubles.  He watches TV with his dad. He adores his mom. He's unconventionally sexual at times - fretting  guiltily that his great-aunt Pearl, a real character with whom he is wonderfully close,  lives nearby some of the locations of his escapades,  and he isn't going to be stopping in to visit her.<br />He's insomniac and wonders how he could ever spend a full night with a lover, since he has so much trouble getting a good night's sleep, period. He is drawn to many women, endeavors  to please them, and it would seem that he does. He is funny, but he is quite competent.  <br />Ames freely admits to intense Oedipal conflicts (except for him they aren't conflicts; he embraces them - and they don't get in his way in the least). At the age of 28 he meets an appealing woman, a composer 37 years his senior. They go to bed, and have a lovely time of it. Ames describes the event in its entirety (&quot;Oedipus Erects&quot;). He's sweet.  He wants you to laugh and to love him, and it's easy to do both.<br />Ames' revelations about love, attachment, sexuality, and his winsome acceptance of his own and others' foibles make this book a delight. He is sincere and sweet and uninhibited. He believes in love and friendship, and he has a great memory. This book is thoroughly worthwhile.	2001-08-20

This is the third of his trilogy.<br />Bayley says early that after his wife's death, he felt afraid, and really quite unable to cope. Even old friends seemed frightening: &quot;All old friends were now threats.&quot; Of his wife's effect on him he writes, &quot;And although Iris was unaware of it in the old days, before she was ill I was always under her protection.&quot; A catastrophe, then, has occurred; he is alone in the world, and scared of the world. But she is gone, and he finds himself in demand, the object of solicitous attention and effort  but unable or unwilling to value the people, especially the women, who offer it. Of his situation he writes that widowers &quot;don't lead lives. They wait for something to happen. And when something does happen, it becomes a muddle from which at once they have to try to escape.&quot; In fact, Bayley writes that he wants solitude, not company, but it is company that he is warmly and enthusiastically offered.<br />An old family friend, a widow, &quot;Margot,&quot; extends courtesy, warmth, and a variety of selfless kindnesses to him. Margot brings him casseroles. Bayley confides to his reader that he dislikes casseroles, but it is an unendearing confession.  Eventually he becomes reacquainted with &quot;Mella,&quot; an enigmatic and unlucky young woman, a former student, who not only makes a series of good attempts to clean his famously squalid house, but also passes many not at all unpleasant hours with him.  These two women shower the recalcitrant Bayley with attention and affection. His response is for the most part lukewarm at best, and horrified -in a sort of quiet and not quite subtly misogynistic horror - at worst. <br />Bayley was lucky: he lived in what he freely describes as a physically chaotic and  dirty mess,  took minimal care of himself and  - from the sound of his report - made paltry efforts toward others. Still and all, he was attended to with grace and kindness. He writes, &quot;How much I had suffered lately from kindness, and from goodness.&quot;  I would offer that widows will not see themselves or their situation in that of John Bayley - and may even want to give him a good shake.<br />The second half of the book is a series of interesting musings on grief and loss, with good literary allusion and references (Thomas Hardy, Kipling, Shakespeare, Milton, Virginia Woolf, and many more). In addition there is good description of his married life, Alzheimer's disease, and of his life as a caregiver.  A mystery involving Margot and Mella is resolved, and for Bayley there is a happy ending.<br />A story  that is worth reading for a look into the mind of its author. I'd disagree with its publisher, who claims on its cover that it is  &quot;a book to be give into anyone dealing with the catastrophic loss of a loved one. &quot; Many widows' primary problem is acute social isolation, which was not experienced by Mr. Bayley - a man who, despite his protestations, was awfully lucky in the year of his widowerhood.	2001-08-11

Zebras, awnings, prisoners in old movies: stripes may have seemed either unusual (the zebra), somehow functional (traffic crossings) or banal (tee shirts) but in all cases, not particularly meaningful. This book will change all that. It is several things: a scholarly semiology of stripes, a thoughtful and thought-provoking investigation into the variety of historic social meanings of striped surfaces and, best of all, an irresistible initiation to the reader to ponder (under wonderfully playful and able guidance) not only stripes but their significance - both unconscious and deliberate - to the varieties of historic and contemporary human social discourse. It turns out that stripes mean a lot.<br />Michel Pastoureau is an accomplished French paleographer and archivist and an expert on heraldry and other symbology. This book, he informs the reader in his introduction, is the one among the thirty-five he has written that most &quot;truly corresponds to what I had hoped to write at the outset.&quot; His idea for the book, as well as his burgeoning interest in, and curiosity about, the stripe derived from his interest in Medievalism. &quot;In medieval dress, everything means something,&quot; and therefore he knew he was onto something big ' regarding stripes. Asserting that the stripe is &quot;not a form but a structure,&quot; Pastoureau organizes this exposition chronologically, beginning with the 13th century. He explores the history and the meanings of pattern and structure from a social point of view; his knowledge of production methods will please textile historians, and his playful and open-minded approach (he asks a lot of questions, to which there may or may not be answers) incites both awe and curiosity in the reader.<br />The stripe's changing meaning is explored; two chapters, &quot;From the Diabolic to the Domestic,&quot; and &quot;From the Domestic to the Romantic&quot; are especially useful. He followsthe stripe into its contemporary uses and meanings (&quot;A stripe often leads to a uniform, and the uniform to a penalty.&quot;) His discussion of its many roles and ramifications takes off in &quot;Stripes for the Present Time,&quot; on contemporary stripes.<br />Pastoureau is eager to share both his sources and his further thoughts, and does so in his 112 generous and interesting endnotes. (He has studied the social meanings of animals and colors, too.) So, for example note 28, on the leopard (for there is a section on spots in this book) remarks &quot; The bad name given to the leopard in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries allows the lion to unload on the leopard all its own negative aspects.&quot; There is a good index, too.<br />Far from being merely another little book on a footnote to fashion or art history, this is a scholarly and philosophical work that is by turns deeply playful (Pastoureau discusses striped toothpaste, too), deeply thoughtful, and generously invites the reader to join the conversation. A topic that you might have thought too small or unimportant to be the subject of a book proves itself to be wholly worthy. A great book.	2001-08-08

I read it in one sitting and was deeply moved. There is great tenderness and an aching acceptance of people and their confusions and inevitable weaknesses (and power) in it. Its several digressions (from its loose plot) are trenchant and valuable - and come as something of a pleasant surprise. As in so many of Roth's books several erotic themes predominate: they are Roth's currency, and  his way into his psyche, and into the hearts and minds of his interesting characters. (For example, Roth never confuses sex with food.) In this layered story Roth takes on sickness, aging, and impending death.  He intimately explores people who refuse to go quietly, who rail and protest and want to hang on to life and all of its exquisite pleasures - which for Roth, are frequently erotic. Rothian eros is so much more than sexual acts, but rather is so often at the heart of the matter, and the vantage point from which his readers might begin to understand the world. <br />A great book that is thoroughly worth reading.	2001-08-07

By the way, it is not only for straight couples; the information is universally useful -regardless of one's sexual orientation.  Female genitalia and sexual response are mysteries to enough well-meaning lovers of women that a book like this becomes particularly useful.  More than mere physiology, however, the Bodanskys also convey the mindset of each partner (to successfully give pleasure to another you need to listen, practice, enjoy yourself - and, yes: to nicely take charge) that promotes and then enables full sexual expression and, yes - reliable and then even &quot;extended massive&quot; orgasms.

These are candid (though not unplanned) shots of men and women, men together, women together, kids together, smiling threesomes, lovers kissing, carnival scenes, nudists, swimmers, sea lions, dogs, horses,  trees and plants, a Raggedy Ann and Andy, monkeys in the zoo - and even two old cars, one dark, one light (taken in 1950)  that somehow all make sense. The pictures are lively, vivid, and satisfying in black and white. <br />While some of his subjects (children, dogs, nudists, lovers) might provoke easy sentimentality or, in other cases, voyeurism elsewhere, under Erwitt's gaze, people and animals retain dignity and depth and, often, a sense of humor.  He often photographs people or animals in the act of looking at something or someone else: there is rarely just one thing happening in an Erwitt photo, no matter how simple and straightforward the shot. In addition, his subjects are wrapped up in what they are doing, and it's great fun to watch them at their lives.   Erwitt contributes a thoughtful and personal introduction that is part autobiography,  part artist's notes,  and part theory. This is a great collection, happy but never maudlin,  that is fun, interesting, and a useful and patient teacher of the art and craft of photography.	2001-07-30

If you dig a little,  you will find that in fact, buried deep in the middle of this book  are two choice bones: an essay, &quot;My Dog Days,&quot; by Erwitt, and  P. G. Wodehouse's &quot;About My Friends,&quot; an appreciation of Elliott Erwitt and of dogs, in Erwitt's words, &quot; easy, uncomplaining targets.&quot; Wodehouse traces his own colorful history of dog-owning with warmth and dry humor. Whereas Erwitt writes that &quot;with dogs, as with love affairs, the first and the last are most vivid,&quot; Wodehouse seems to vividly remember many more than a couple of dogs.<br />Wodehouse is convincing, for example, in his assertion that Aberdeen terriers are so &quot;full of the Calvinistic spirit that it is impossible for an ordinary erring human being not to feel ill at ease in their presence.&quot; He loves dogs, (some more than others), he doesn't apologize for it, and asks, finally, for &quot;a standing ovation to all dogs,&quot; which is precisely what this terrific little book delivers.	2001-07-26

We are treated to its cast of characters, old New York, country life up the Hudson River, the clothes, the houses, and the remarkable (and unremarkable) personalities - Washington Irving was a friend of the family - as well as the sensibilities of a sociable, bright, and wonderfully observant little girl.<br />Edith began to read so early that it surprised her upper-class (but unintellectual) family. Before long she became an &quot;omnivorous reader,&quot; happiest plowing through the volumes of the classics in her father's library. She soon found that she required time alone - to invent characters, to make up stories. She knew that she had to write fiction - from childhood on, despite realizing by young adulthood that &quot;in the eyes of our provincial society authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a form of manual labor.&quot; Of the social imperative to closet one's writing urges she elaborates: &quot;My father and mother were only one generation away from Sir Walter Scott, who thought it necessary to drape his literary identity in countless clumsy subterfuges, and almost contemporary with the Brontes, who shrank in agony from being suspected of successful novel-writing.&quot; The idle rich, Wharton makes clear, were intended to stay idle - and not busy themselves with writing, especially for (horrors!) pay. Her descriptions of her early popular successes are memorable.<br />In subsequent chapters Wharton lays out her well-thought-out opinions regarding childhood, self-discovery, the formation of the writer's imagination and intellect, and the importance of finding one's own way - as an intellectual and as a social being. There is dry humor, too. She treasured good literature and good conversation - and pursued (and found) them throughout her life. She loved beautiful things and places, too. Finally, she describes her sojourns abroad (mainly England, France, and Italy) and the relationships and places that sustained her and nurtured her creativity, her productivity - and her soul.<br />Lifelong friends play a central role in much of this memoir. She describes people well, without breaches of privacy or confidences. This is not at all limiting. She writes tenderly of the blossoming of her friendship with &quot;American gentleman&quot; Egerton Winthrop, a man of &quot;cultivated intelligence,&quot; a shy, physically awkward man whom Wharton considered &quot;the most perfect of friends.&quot; Others were George Cabot Lee, Vernon Lee, Howard Sturgis, Geoffrey Scott, Percy Lubbock, and most of all, Henry James, who is drawn wonderfully (and not uncritically) in this book. Of her friendship with James she remarks &quot;The real marriage of two minds is for any two people to possess a sense of humor or irony pitched in exactly the same key, so that their joint glances at any subject cross like interarching search-lights.&quot;<br />I loved this memoir, and greatly admired Wharton's ability to reveal herself and her world so fully and well.t her life.

Simpson's protagonists are smart married London women-with-children in their thirties. Several are well-paid professionals working in corporate worlds, and the rest used to, but are now home with young children. (Their good-looking husbands are not much part of the action of these stories.)  These competent women are by turns cynical (&quot;Stress! She could handle it. She positively enjoyed jumping in its salty waves.&quot; - from &quot;Burns and the Bankers&quot;) and full of yearning - for connection, for sex, love, enough hours in the day, and - to their husbands' consistent dismay: even another baby. <br />Simpson's protagonists are most often outwardly composed and howlingly distressed. A day starts out like any other and quietly appalling (and wholly believable) events take place.  The action is described acidly, accurately, and sometimes from several points of view. <br />Simpson's ability to turn a phrase wowed me, along with her pitch-perfect ear for dialogue.  She can by turns describe a shopping trip, an evening at the opera, sexual disappointment, the inner life of a teenage girl, the weather, office politics, men in kilts, or intense emotional states in ways that left me breathless.

Myers' voice is calm and reflective. He has looked back on the vanished world of his 1940's and 50's Harlem childhood and adolescence with a deceptive calmness, and a pleasing recall of detail. School, friends, teachers, family life, community life, and (not insignificantly to Myers, a voracious reader) the covers and contents of pulp novels and magazines, as seen through a child's eyes - are all here. <br />Some of the more disturbing facts of his young life are reported on in a deadpan manner that at first seems almost flat. In one emblematic incident, a well-meaning teacher asks him his career plans, and upon hearing that Myers hopes to become a lawyer, flat-out tells him he can't, since he has a speech defect.<br />Myers made trouble, and he matter-of-factly tells why. Kids will appreciate his thoughtful explanations and self-understanding. But Myers was also a reader - not just for escape, but for the love of literature- and he lets us in that that process (and its consequences to his social life), too. <br />The chapters &quot;Bad Boy,&quot; &quot;I Am Not the Center of the Universe,&quot; and &quot;Stuyvesant High&quot; are particularly useful for their descriptions of important and formative experiences. <br />This is a story that is told humbly. It lacks melodrama not because Myers' early life was dull, but because Myers is a quiet writer; he trusts himself and his legions of young readers. He invites them in this quiet memoir to enter his quite remarkable experiences - and to form their own opinions.  I enjoyed this sensitive (but not humorless) story very much, and came away with renewed interest and respect for its author.<br />Completely worthwhile.	2001-07-19

The collection is much bigger than that - in conception and execution.<br />Having culled the opinions of well- and lesser-known writers, humorists, thinkers, and fictional characters, the editors have managed to put together a lively tour of bibliophilia and its satellites (education, censorship, and more).  Chapters such as &quot;What to Read,&quot; &quot;What Books Do - and Don't Do - For Us,&quot; &quot;How to Read,&quot; &quot;Books and The Young,&quot; contain quotes that are by turns thoughtful, funny, sensible - and sometimes wonderfully silly. So there is James Thurber (presumably answering the query, &quot;How do you read?&quot;) offering, &quot;I always begin at the left with the opening word of a sentence and read towards the right, and I recommend this method.&quot; <br />To readers who imagine that books will necessarily change their lives, George Bernard Shaw offers the tart and deflating remark that &quot;People get nothing out of books but what they bring to them.&quot; <br />The editors give the issue of freedom of the press plenty of room, and Terence Qualter's remark that &quot;The weapon of the dictator is not so much propaganda as censorship,&quot; from his 1962 book &quot;Propaganda and Psychological Warfare&quot; is cited. Jimmy Walker, past Mayor of New York, weighs in with &quot;No girl was ever ruined by a book.&quot;<br />Critics everywhere can laugh at the words of Sydney Smith of &quot;The Smith of Smiths&quot; (1934) by Heskith Pearson, who asserted &quot;I never read a book before reviewing it; it prejudices a man so.&quot;  And cat lovers everywhere will be offended by Mark Twain, who wrote,&quot; I like a thin book because it will steady a table, a leather volume because it will strop a razor, and a heavy book because it can be thrown at a cat.&quot;<br />There's an index of people quoted, but not a subject index (which would have been nice).

Mythology, religion, linguistics, classical influences, and Picasso's upbringing and circumstances and adult life (among many other things)  are all explored in the dozen essays that make this book such great reading.<br />Clair's own &quot;The School of Darkness&quot; is a heady and passionate appreciation of Picasso. He contributes right off to the decades-old debate regarding Picasso's view and treatment of women. He defends the artist and the man,  rejecting portrayals of Picasso as &quot; the ogre, the dark demon, the wife-eating Minotaur,&quot; quoting writer Micheline Sauvage's words on Don Juan: &quot;Not the profaner of love, but the hero of profane love.&quot; Picasso possessed energy and drive that included prodigious eating, drinking, sexual expression, writing, the production of art, and more art.<br />Housekeeping out of the way, Clair's  essay grows into something remarkable: part biography, part chant. If you read it aloud you might well amaze and delight yourself and your listener. <br />Annie Le Brun's &quot;Painting in the Bedroom&quot; successfully places Picasso's erotic sensibilities and drive  in context and in comparison to other painters, whom she asserts (and proves) shared traits with Picasso. 'Diamond Made of All the Love of the Loves of Blood,' (the title comes from a diary entry of  the artist) by Marie-Noelle Delorme is a fabulouscompilation, effectively and subtlely organized, that shows Picasso the energetic and larger-than-life diarist - a passionate and powerful writer on love, bodies, intimate landscapes, and much more. <br />The illustrations - a &quot;Chronological Catalogue of Exhibited Works,&quot;  fill over 200 pages. The layout and the colors are good and the plates are big enough. There are oil paintings, etchings, drawings in pencil, colored pencil, chalk, ink, and charcoal;  aquatint, drypoint, etchings; sculptures in wood, plaster, clay and bronze - and more. The earliest drawing is a copulation scene, &quot;Donkey and She-Ass,&quot; done by a nine-year old Picasso - who as a schoolboy was already drawing confidently and well and, it can be argued, had already found his voice. <br />The works are of men, women, animals together, animals with people, blind men, lovers, voyeurs, brothel scenes, outsized genitalia,  mythological beasts and people, nudes in classical poses, Cubist paintings on erotic themes, sketches of solicitude and tenderness and caring, playfully altered pin-ups from the 50's, visions of sexuality altered but undimmed by old age, and much more.<br />By virtue of its twelve strong, smart, passionate essays, and its 300 plates,  this  book becomes much more than the sum of its parts.  Very worthwhile, and a great read.	2001-07-11

Despite the fact that the Editorial Review above contains what are nearly plot spoilers, there were plenty of surprises, puzzles, sly and enjoyable literary references and plays on words - plus dozens of opportunities for outright guffawing. This is a very, very funny book.<br />I  picked up &quot;The Sonnets&quot; hoping to not need to dutifully  flip through Shakespeare's 154 sonnets (plus &quot;A Lover's Complaint&quot;)  as I went, since - in contrast to the novel's clever and passionate - but comically self-deprecating narrator - I have neither read nor &quot;taught the Bard so long that his thoughts had become mine.&quot;  I hoped to read one book, not two. I think it went okay.  You don't need to have Shakespeare alongside this novel in order to enjoy the goings-on, be appalled at times, delighted at others - and to laugh a lot.<br />Protagonist Will Marlowe is a readily recognizable fiftyish English professor. He's a smart world-wise guy, a dyed-in-the-wool left-winger with an impeccable intellect, and a freight of desires. He is by turns vexed and thrilled by his wife, his kids, his dull or clever and beautiful students, aspects of work, domestic life,  sexuality, and urbanity. He is seducible and cynical at once: he falls for a thing, an idea, a person - but watches himself - carefully. He checks his back. <br />He has got the soul of the poet combined with a reporter's eye for detail. He is most definitely of this world. Academic life engages him at times, but often gets on his nerves. A colleague has received a MacArthur grant, an endowed chair, &quot;so successfully had he pulled the New Zealand wool over the eyes of the administration,&quot; and it stings. Marlowe sniffs, &quot; Meanwhile I remained unacknowledged, occupying a small oak and leather chair that had no name other than that of its manufacturer - the Acme Furniture Company of New Bedford, Massachusetts.I like to think of myself as the Acme Furniture Professor of Shakespearean Studies.&quot;  <br />Whether it's a bad dinner guest, scenes of discovery and betrayal,  modern manners, urban life, the contents of gourmet food shops, fabulous scenes of love and varieties of endearingly realistic sexual encounters (originally, convincingly, unegomanically and successfully described), an obnoxious colleague, post-modern hijinks and linguistic acrobatics - or a  quirky and funny approach to some psychoanalytic themes - all are handled well by Davis.<br />His protagonist screws things up in ways that are absurd, sometimes reference back to Shakespeare's sonnets, often deeply affecting - and are often laugh-out-loud funny. <br />An academic novel that is a lot of fun.	2001-07-08

Klee fought in World War One. He had begun his working life as a draughtsman, but soon moved toward finer \\"art.\\" His early doubts about himself as well as his eventually confident assertions are here. The result is a clear picture of Klee the man and the artist - as well as a feel for his artistic and deeply thought-out process - over the years of his too-brief life. (He died at 61, in 1940.)<br><br>Hall discusses Klee's significant contributions to theories of color, composition, the relationship of music to visual art; edges, textures, the use of the frame; !abstraction and symbolism. Klee's participation in the Bauhaus at Weimar (closed by the Nazis in 1931) is detailed. He was fired from his teaching job at the Dusseldorf Academy in 1933. The Fascist persecution of modern artists began and Klee and his wife left Germany to return to the safety of their native Switzerland.<br><br>The plates' color is good and best of all, many of the paintings in this book are in private collections, so you're seeing some things you won't ever find in museums. Some of the plates show only a detail of the full painting, with the full painting reproduced in black and white, opposite. This is occasionally frustrating.<br><br>Finally, Klee's well-known late paintings : boldly colorful, starkly minimal and emotionally expressive - each about his own imminent death - are included with trenchant and sympathetic commentary. There is an Outline Biography, a Select Bibliography, and 48 color plates spanning Klee's entire painting life.<br><br>A great book.	2001-07-04

Grohmann was Klee's biographer and longtime friend. He is respectful without being sycophantic, and thorough but never plodding. He uses a variety of source materials, including Klee's own writings (diaries and letters).  Grohmann establishes Klee's lasting importance to art and to painting by asserting, &quot;It is as though he were still among us, to be consulted on every problem of life and art.&quot; Grohmann's generous(40 pages, 58 illustrations) and lively essay on Klee is also charming and personal. It combines biography, criticism, a wealth of references, and  thought-provoking appreciation. It's generously illustrated with photographs of Klee and his studio, plus ink, tusche, chalk, and pencil drawings, collage, watercolor, tempera, and oil paintings, a woodcut study, and etchings.<br />The  text that accompanies the following forty color plates (a selection of paintings) is the calm, clear art criticism that Grohmann is so good at. The plates' reproduced colors are good but not great.  What's best is that Grohmann is such an able teacher. He describes each painting straightforwardly, and then asks intelligent questions, suggests answers that seem well-thought-out, and inspires one to further thought and research. His friendship with Klee gave him some additional understanding of his friend's work and lifelong passions and motives.<br />A very worthwhile book on a great artist.	2001-07-04

Bennett, intrigued by her and  concerned for her safety (which was not always assured)  subtly befriended her.  Within a few months she had moved the van closer to his house. She stayed for years  and this slim book, first published in 1989 as a long piece in &#34;The London Review of Books,&#34; is the story of their gently and sometimes humorously intersecting lives. In subsequent years Miss S.'s highly individual sense of upward mobility would find expression, and there would be replacement vans.  Miss S. was a Catholic who loved to paint her vans and favored yellow - asserting &#34;it's the papal colour.&#34; She was sometimes demanding of Bennett's time, requesting favors and errands of him. She never said &#34;Thanks.&#34; She revealed precious little about her past: only of her current opinions. She wrote and sold pamphlets on the street that she claimed were authored anonymously. She sold pencils on the street, claiming that her pencils were the best.  She was given to fanatical religious and political pronouncements, and outrageous statements of prejudice and some silliness.  Her right-wing politics clashed with Bennett's, and her comments on current events - reported deadpan, and verbatim - were often very funny. Old age and its freight of health and personal problems dogged her, and Bennett did what he could to help. Alan Bennett is a great listener. In addition he can  tell a story simply and clearly, with  precision and understatement.  He tells just enough. He encourages his characters to speak for themselves. This is a great little nonfiction story that is tender but never mawkish - told with wit and elegance.	2001-06-30

Sometimes it's the hardware, occasionally it's the software, but often it's the operating system, Windows 98, that is giving me a problem. The Dell employee recommended this book to me, asserting that in his view and the view of his cohorts &quot;Windows 98 Annoyances&quot; is the best reference available for the wide variety of little problems, bigger puzzles, and flat-out mysteries that Windows 98 is so devilishly capable of posing to its zillions of users.<br />I like to read a book from start to finish, which you obviously do not need to do with this one. On the other hand Karp has explained and provided straightforward solutions to at least twenty obstacles, glitches, or difficulties I've encountered with Windows 98. There is a wealth of conceptual information here, too. In addition to  responding awfully well to niggling problems, Karp also supplies the demystifying know-how that enables you to modify aspects of your set-up. It's terrific, there's a CD ROM with it, the index is a real index that is a tool and not a token - and I wish that I could personally thank that Dell tech support guy for giving me such great advice by recommending that I buy this book.	2001-06-27
US	51725472	RYVFK37RI672N	0465007074	713282813	The Future Of Nostalgia	Books	5	45	49	N	N	Exile's disease	This amazing book has been efficiently described by its Editorial Reviews. It is ingenious, absorbing, and by turns difficult and thrilling. Do not be misled by the kitschy or simplistic associations you might have to the term &quot;nostalgia.&quot; Exile, either voluntary or forced - no small thing either way -  is its precondition.<br />Many, but far from all,  of the examples and references are Russian and Eastern European. Each of the seventeen chapters is an essay of depth and precision. They are greatly satisfying: rich and dense with associations and references from art and literature, and the entire span of recorded human history. <br />Boym names Part One &quot;Hypochondria of the Heart,&quot; and variously introduces her kaleidoscopic interests in  nostalgia - as an  &quot;epidemic.&quot; Nostalgia, she asserts (and proves convincingly) is &quot;the disease of an afflicted imagination.&quot;  It afflicts those who would become assimilated to their new worlds -  as well as those who (variously and often highly individualistically)  resist.  The second section, &quot;Cities and Re-invented Traditions&quot; contains five chapters that  focus on Russian and  European conceptions and realities. The final part, &quot;Exiles and Imagined Homelands&quot; is my favorite.  Its chapters cover among other things the excess of souvenirs to be found in immigrants' apartments (knickknacks of identity and remembrance that would not ever be displayed back home); cyberspace, which &quot;makes the bric-a-brac of nostalgia available in digital form&quot;; the persistence of immigrant eccentricity;  the preservation (and transformation) of attitudes, and various phenomena of adjustment. Some of the personages discussed (for there is never mere name-dropping in this book)  are Adam and Eve (&quot;the first exiles&quot;)  Ovid, Telemachus, Oedipus,  Odysseus, Walter Benjamin, Freud, Hanna Arendt,  painter Ilya Kabakov, Joseph Brodsky, and Vladimir Nabokov - to name a few. <br />I loved this book. There isn't a slow page in it.  Boym is passionately interested in art, history, psychology, signs and symbols, literature, urbanism, politics, and people. She's a deep thinker who is guided by her considerable ability to keep several balls in the air at once, to teach with clarity, and to really understand what makes people tick. There's a good index and over thirty pages of notes that enable a lot of further reading in this big and interesting subject.<br />A great book that deserves more than five Amazon stars.	2001-06-22

The many photographs, engravings, historic and relevant photographs, beautiful paintings, and good nature photography  - are first-rate. <br />Jim Poling, Sr. begins at the beginning with &quot;The First Canoeists.&quot; Christopher Columbus writes of his astonishment at seeing canoes in action:   &quot;They are not so wide because they are made of a single log of timber, but a galley could not keep up with them in rowing  for their motion is a thing beyond belief.&quot; <br />Pacific Coast canoes were made of cedar;  northern inland canoes, of bark ( most often elm, hickory, spruce, and cedar).  The &quot;perfect material,&quot; birch, plentiful and remarkable, was used in the canoes of what would become the Canadian Maritime Provinces, northern New England, and Quebec, Ontario, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In addition birch (or its bark)  provided  the material of choice for Indians' toboggans, snowshoes, utensils, children's toys - plus  winter covers for wigwams, food wrapping, animal calls, arrows and quivers, among other things. Finally, there were skin canoes.<br />Poling describes the building of the various types of canoes. The initial contact between Europeans and the indigenous people of the North American continent is the focus of the second chapter. The canoe enabled access to inlands  - and the ensuing frenzy of fur trading - that would otherwise have been impossible to accomplish on anything but waterways. <br />Poling describes in good detail various components of historic canoe culture among the sixteenth and seventeenth century European settlers, paying close attention to the New France coureurs de bois - &quot; runners of the woods.&quot; These were physically sturdy young men employed to fan out into the deep north woods, make contact with Indians, and facilitate the fur trade. But once set free, these fellows almost to a man dropped out of the repressive seventeenth-century French culture they had known. They embraced the woods and the physically taxing but otherwise rather freewheeling nonChristian life to be lived there - to the utter dismay of  the colonists back at the settlements.   The coureurs comprised  &quot;a distinct social class in the new land [...] neither liked nor accepted by the establishment [...] disrespectful of authority, irreverent, and violent...&quot;  Their occasional temporary  re-entry into the precarious settlements was always problematic. They openly patronized prostitutes and rejected conventional European customs and manners.  The problem became so severe that &quot;the matter was brought to Louis XIV, who issued a 1681 decree limiting the number of coureurs du bois. Those who ignored it were branded with the fleur-de-lis, the symbol of France, and third offenders got life on the galley ships.&quot; Poling adds: &quot;The decree didn't work.&quot;<br />The beaver - mainstay of indigenous culture - is given good treatment in this book, and interesting tidbits are supplied - such as the fact that the French settlers enjoyed  beaver meat to such an extent that &quot;in an odd twist of logic someone persuaded the Roman Catholic Church to allow beaver consumption during Lent, when meat was forbidden. The argument was that the beaver spent most of its time in water and therefore was more fish than animal.&quot;<br />Additional chapters detail among other things the horrors of the various skirmishes and all-out wars between Europeans and Indians (no detail spared), the role of the canoe in war (transportation only, too tippy to be battleships)  the canoe routes, freight, trade, and changes in canoe design and function.   Finally, there is information on the modern face of canoeing, building your own, and resources for canoeists. This book lacks an index and a bibliography, but is otherwise a great read (and would be great read aloud) - and thoroughly worthwhile.	2001-06-20

An elegant and informative Foreword by Michael Wood provides biographical material on Stanley Kauffmann, a lifelong theater and film critic, film and theater professor,  and essayist.  <br />Kauffmann sent his first (unsolicited) film review to The New Republic in 1958, and has been their film critic since then.  Kauffmann : &quot;The mere physical act of film-going is part of the kinesis of my life- the getting up and going out and the feeling of coming home, which is a somewhat different homecoming feeling from anything else except the theater...To have my life unpunctuated by the physical act of film going  is almost like walking with a limp, out of my natural rhythm.&quot;<br />This terrific collection has been divided into a few sections: &quot;Reviews,&quot;  &quot;Reviewings,&quot; &quot;Comment,&quot; and &quot;Books.&quot; The reviews are written deceptively simply, one of Kauffmann's many  subtle abilities. He draws you into his view of a film and its possibilities (realized or not) with gentleness and assuredness. He is never noisy, flippant, or condescending. When he objects to something (and he does, often) he lays it out clearly - and humanely.  It's a pleasure.<br />Kauffmann can be funny, too, and has an innate sense of what is worth re-telling. Kauffmann's  wonderful review of Kevin Brownlow's biography of director David Lean starts off: &quot;David Lean began life as a dunce. His kindergarten teacher told his mother that she was afraid he would never be able to read and write. He managed to disprove that prediction, buy otherwise there was little sparkle.&quot; Of course Lean, raised a Quaker in London,  discovered movies at age 13, and everything changed.<br />Kauffmann eagerly promotes his favorites (Emma Thompson is one, he has much respect for Warren Beatty, and pays close attention to smaller, unsung filmmakers) and is painstakingly fair to actors and filmmakers -in consistently thoughtful uses of his pulpit. He begins his review of a small Iranian film, &quot;Through the Olive Trees,&quot; by expressing his thanks to the friend who prompted him to first have a look at its director's work, and then he thanks the director himself. Kauffmann is a man who loves the medium,  and reveres its potential to provide hope and transformation - along with a lot of fun.<br />These great pieces are definitely worth reading and rereading.	2001-06-17

Cute childish scribbles, elaborate adolescent doodles  - or one's cleverest penciled responses to one text or another - provoked the same horrified response from the librarian. Dr. H.J. Jackson asserts and then asks, &quot;Of course children should be taught not to write in other people's books; but why should they be denied the outlet of writing in their own?&quot;<br />&quot;Annotation,&quot; known by your grade school teacher as &quot;ruining your books,&quot; has a long and colorful history. Erasmus recommended to his students that they write in their texts. In England, Coleridge was revered in his day as now for his prolific commentaries and, according to Jackson, &quot;his name associated with the publication and popularization of the genre.&quot;  At one point English children were taught how, specifically, to best annotate their books. Importantly, annotation was finally seen in a positive light, as a way to read actively: &quot;a discipline that fosters attentive reading, intellectual self-awareness, and incisive writing.&quot; <br />Dr. Jackson's tour of marginalia's  most ardent and consistent practitioners reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of English-speaking literary history: Sir James Frazer, Boswell, Johnson, Hester Lynch Piozzi, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexander Pope, Virginia Woolf, John Ruskin, William Blake, Ellen Terry, T.H. White, Gertrude Stein, Northrup Frye, Vladimir Nabokov - and many more. In addition,  much good annotation was done by readers whose names have been lost.  There are hilarious anecdotes and quotes as well as perceptive character sketches. Jackson loves her subject and her cast of characters - and includes many interesting and amusing stories about the lives of the annotators.  (In one anecdote  Maurice Sendak, at a book signing, is warned by a panicked child not to wreck his new book - by autographing it. Sendak complies with the child's wishes.)<br />In addition Dr Jackson discusses North American and British museum and library collections of annotated books. There are novels, nonfiction,  family bibles, college textbooks, cookbooks, and children's books in addition to classic and obscure texts. <br />Dr. Jackson is passionate about her subject. She's been at it for years. Addressing the arguments against its practice. She includes a thoughtful essay  &quot;Book Use or Book Abuse.&quot;  There are hundreds of endnotes, a  Bibliography of Annotated Books Cited, a Bibliography of Secondary Works Cited, and a good index. <br />This  thrilling and careful study is by turns English literary history, the history of books and reading,  trenchant psychological exploration, and biography. In addition, there is mystery, gossip, and fun. This is a wonderful book on a subject I'd never given much thought to, not realizing that writing in the margins has a glorious past -  and having felt vaguely guilty for years for penciling so many of  my books. <br />Definitely worth reading.	2001-06-14

It is  introduced by its creator, Michael Green. In one elegant paragraph he tell us a lot about the diaries he used: &quot;What struck me was their fascination with food (dinner was usually described in great detail and many of the dishes were rather strange by modern standards). Death and illness were also subject to close scrutiny. There seemed a compulsion to record sexual adventures in high-flown language which contrasted with the sordid realities [...] And there was an obsession with small sums of money.&quot; Green's protagonist, Amos  Haggard (soon to be joined by his son) stays within these parameters as he takes the reader on a tour of his world (London, and then a comic tour of Europe).  His diary entries are in turns droll, hysterically funny, gently repulsive (mostly the menu items), bawdy, and shot through with very funny political commentary on the hypocrisy (and criminality, sometimes) of the upper classes.<br />The journal begins on September 16, 1777  with a deadpan report of a man, Jas. Soaper,  having been hung for stealing a nail.  By the next day, we learn  that &quot;Jas. Soaper found to be innocent.&quot;   Amos Haggard is a man who knows his own mind; if not closed, it is narrow.  &quot;I make it an infallible rule while travellg. abroad to see as little of the scenery as possible; thus the mind is not unsettled and disturbed by the wild excesses of Nature and barren deserts such as the Scottish Highlands.&quot;  But he does travel; he goes to France, landing on &quot;the loathsome land of Toads and Pederasts&quot; and then to Paris, where for sport he insults the French, and finds that is impressed by the Bastille. He admires the variety of punishments there, is impressed by the prison's architecture, and  makes a quick sketch - &quot;with a view to erctg. a smaller copy in England.&quot;<br />Squire Haggard  knows that  December 25th is &quot;the most sacred feast in the Christian Calendar,&quot;  and observes annually by setting out early in the morning to evict his tenants who are in arrears. The day proceeds. He reports on his misdeeds and lack of nominal ethics with an insouciance that is constantly ridiculously funny.<br />There is a slyly woven plot  that offers ample satirical commentary on the historic English preoccupations of class and money. There are imagined and real insults,  bad food and dyspepsia, gossip and civil intrigue, poisonings, outrageous behavior, and (in a wholly successful parody of  Plague diaries) the ever-present Death. In addition there is romance, bawdy fun, much too much drinking and, at evening's end - Squire Haggard's inevitable reluctance to settle the bill. <br />I laughed my way through this very entertaining little book.	2001-06-05
US	51725472	R2JOM67MFPH5KK	0670899844	631117873	Thinks . . .	Books	4	33	34	N	N	Collision avoidance	David Lodge by his own admission has been writing novels since he was 17. He's in his sixties, now, and is a master of the craft. He has produced  coming-of-age novels, comic romps, academic novels, comical and bittersweet stories of yearning and loss - along with a variety of other conventional and experimental works. He has a big heart. In addition he is a prolific critic and essayist.  He is great at parody, and has firm and interesting opinions regarding Catholicism, academia, modernity, the writing life, sex,  death,  relationships between friends, spouses, and lovers - among many other things. <br />&quot;Thinks&quot; is both an academic novel and a comedy of manners - containing elements of all of the above. Within a plot both complicated and much too simple the fictitious University of Gloucester provides the setting for the events.  A bright,  sexually and intellectually restless - and highly verbal - married but chronically adulterous scientist,  Ralph Messenger (a dead ringer for Lodge himself, down to each  facial feature) meets a younger female writer-in-residence at the school.  She is a grieving widow, feeling out of place, away from her home in London, and out of sorts. They close in on one another and pull away - throughout the novel. It's a troubling (and troubled) dance.<br />The story unfolds by means of the transcripts of Messenger's stream-of-consciousness on-the- fly musings into a tape recorder. (In perfect Lodgeian fashion, Messenger self-consciously edits the transcripts.) Messenger fancies himself a modern, but is confounded by some of modernity's trappings.  In  alternate chapters, the diary entries of Helen Reed, a novelist of some acclaim and considerable self-awareness, are used to let us in on her thoughts and feelings.<br />So what's the problem? Messenger is a familiar man: we've watched him in action in other novels of Lodge's. Unfortunately  in this one he  possesses much less of the the tenderness, the heartrending confusion,  and (sometimes comical) sexual frustration and/or energy - and vulnerability - that made so many of Lodge's previous protagonists  so irresistibly appealing. In addition, Messenger/Lodge's self-referencing begins to seem precious. Characters from past novels (including Robyn Penrose from &quot;Nice Work&quot;) make cameo appearances that seem almost token.<br />Helen Reed's diary entries are not sufficiently believable- for they are often wooden, much too full of tedious description of the obvious - and usually lacking in any trace of the register of a diary. She doesn't seem to be writing for herself, but for Lodge's presumed audience.  This is a real problem in this novel.<br />The story entertains by means of plotting and timing. As usual from David Lodge there is wit and parody, self-consciousness without narcissism, humor and foolishness,  desire and the reasonable wish to connect  - occasionally running amok. In addition there is Lodge's basic decency toward all. I had hoped for more, though,  from such a capable mind - and wonderful writer.	2001-06-02

Without the irony or condescension heretofore prevalent in discussions about the 1950s'  remarkably popular and widespread middlebrow hobby of painting by number,  William L. Bird, Jr., a curator at the Smithsonian,  starts from the beginning and tells all.  <br />Leonardo da Vinci seems to have thought of it  first, as a way to teach painting.  In 1952 (after  considerable work in the lab and at the drawing board) mass culture combined with smart American commercialism to sell eager Americans first, the rest of the world later - this surprisingly  controversial and intensely pleasurable hobby: paint by number. The paintings and their deeply satisfying means of production were denigrated by cultural critics  - and loved by millions of regular folks - and Andy Warhol, too.<br />Students of popular and consumer culture and advertising,  those curious about a popular phenomenon that provoked the critics of art and culture to attack relentlessly - or anyone interested in reading about the fun of these paintings and how they came to be - will love this perfect book. The author's mind is flexible and fertile;  he takes us on a terrific tour.  Clever and funny in places, with a bibliography hundreds of articles and books long. Great book.	2001-05-30

Ingres was &quot;a wealthy member of the middle classes associated with 'virtuous art' and Raphaelesque purity, the leading exponent of the classical school,&quot; and yet an artist who so often and with such evident enthusiasm and commitment often devoted himself (on canvas and in sketchbooks), despite the taboos of his world,  to the depiction of the unapologetic uninhibited erotic life  of his subjects. Neret goes on to describe the European century as one of comparative repression - which artists craftily got around in the production and then the distribution of their works. To reduce the risk of imprisonment, some claimed anonymity.<br />This is a varied and somewhat difficult collection. Neret has assembled examples that are sometimes jarring in their contrasts.  There is for example the lushly golden torso, in a tangle of sheets, of painter Gustave Courbet's sleeping female model (&quot;The Origin of the World,&quot; 1866) and Degas' nudes (not, I would argue, &quot;erotica&quot; in intention or result). Series of engravings, illustrations for a variety of fancifully obscene books, were in high demand in the first half of the nineteenth century, and they are included. They are nearly cartoonish, and the colors are often garish.  There are dream sequences, parlor high jinks, threesomes, foursomes, voyeurs, business being conducted, feathers, orgies, settings indoors (with great attention paid to interiors: carpets, wallpapers, and furniture depicted carefully) and out - whether in nature on the Grand Canal.  The  men and women in these are in various stages of undress. (Later on in much mainstream pornography, the men would often remain clothed.) This is the stuff of middle-class fantasy - and one suspects it sold well. <br />The devilwould appear to have figured heavily in the pornographic lithographs of Achille Deveria and Eugene Le Poitevin.  As sexual antagonist without parallel the devil conducts his business, enlists his fellows, thinks up and accomplishes hideous erotic &quot;punishments,&quot; lurks in the rooms of the unsuspecting, and causes mayhem and (if the artist is to be believed) not altogether unwelcome mischief. One assumes that nineteenth century sensibilities must have in some way welcomed his leering presence and his tacit approval -in order to feel free to enjoy the goings-on. <br />Victorian mores get sent up in a variety of satirical drawings. The prodigious output of painter and illustrator Felicien Rops, working in Namur,  is included. He's a fabulous artist and a stalwart misogynist capable of a wide range of styles and moods - so long as they depict female suffering in some fashion.   There is death and disfigurement in some of his works, cruciform imagery, and a wide variety of emotionally freighted visual signals. The drawings are sometimes troubling and disturbing. <br />Finally, Neret includes the sinister illustrations for &quot;Lysistrata&quot; done at century's end by the misanthropic and spectacularly misogynistic Aubrey Beardsley. <br />The standout feature of this collection is that it likely will not provoke desire in all but a few, or particularly promote the enjoyment of any sort of sexual expression. Because of that, this collection is not altogether successful as &quot;erotica.&quot;	2001-05-26

He starts out with the far-reaching assertion that &quot;there is only one real antidote to the anguish engendered in humanity  by its awareness of inevitable death: erotic joy.&quot; This collection focuses on the representation and the provocation of that erotic joy.  Those who enjoy explicitly graphic erotica (including those who might prefer to call it 'pornography') will not be disappointed in this book. <br />Neret has an abiding enthusiasm and a curatorial talent,  for he has assembled a wide range of examples of  erotic paintings, drawings, and engravings.  In addition he has a sturdy confidence in the rightness of erotica's goal for its admirers: the enhancement of sexual experience. So yes, at least some of this art will do the customary and expected job of successful 'erotica.' <br />The approximately 170 plates are by European painters and printmakers. When color was used, it has been faithfully reproduced.  The range of media and mood is wide, and the subject matter is consistently explicitly sexual.'Everything' is revealed at times. Threesomes, orgies, assorted combinations and recombinations are sometimes the subjects of  these works.<br />There are boudoir scenes from the 1700's ( paintings of French artist Francois Boucher; the golden and voluptuous paintings of Jean-Honore Fragonard (softly beautiful women: dreaming - attended by cherubs - or sated and asleep in appealing disarray) and an assortment of anonymous politically satirical aat the same time sexually explicit paintings. There are social and cultural satires and a series of explicit and graphic paintings &quot;for the education of the dauphin&quot; that Napoleon hung in his bathroom. (Only several survived).  A 1797 Dutch edition of de Sade's &quot;The Story of Justine or the Misfortunes of Virtue&quot; featured detailed and often gruesome illustrations - and some are included here. <br />From Italy, Carracci's series of engravings, &quot;The Loves of the Gods,&quot; done in 1602, shares similarities of mood and topics with much mainstream pornography of today, but Carracci  named his exuberant couples after classical gods, and inserted  edifying visual details into his scenes of frank and explicit sexual activity: the satyr's hooves, Bacchus' grapes, Achilles' warrior equipment, discarded in favor of Briseis, etc. <br />Rembrandt (yes, Rembrandt)  loved to paint women and evidently loved sexual subjects, for he did numerous erotic paintings, often of his wife and  himself.  His women (and his men) are  real, often in a sort of sensuous and happy disarray,  wrinkled and  classically imperfect -  and beautifully human. The attitudes of the lovers are unidealized, sensuous because so natural - and the drawings are lovely. <br />English painter Thomas Rowlandson published  a series of graphic and consistently and deliberately insulting caricatures of &quot;the sexual practices of the English aristocracy&quot; in the early years of the nineteenth century. Orgies, various sorts of sexualized cruelty, and an assortment of sexual embarrassments pervade his paintings. They were published then, and are reproduced here.<br />This is a  great little book. Art history enthusiasts will not be disappointed in this collection. More to the point, those in search of explicitly sexual art that succeeds at erotica's primary goal will not feel that they have wasted their money on yet more Art History.	2001-05-23

Whether or not you are familiar with Rakoff from his radio spots, in print he is often side-splittingly funny, always witty, and occasionally profound. He is a 'raconteur' in the tradition of the great ones: an event is reported on through his lens, and the results are smart, satisfying. His undergraduate degree is in Japanese studies; he returns to Tokyo (where he first noticed the earliest symptom of cancer, years earlier) and files a report that is original and a great read. <br />In other of his travel pieces, for example, one of his recurring themes (never boring or overdone) is the desperate feeling that inevitably overtakes him when there is nothing left to do in a place, yet there are another few days before he can leave. His wit and cynicism is tempered, though, by self-deprecation and a sense of absurdity (also not overdone). <br />Amortized on a per-laugh basis, this collection is a remarkable bargain, too. Completely worthwhile.	2001-05-20

The photography of Dr. Emil Mayer (the &quot;Dr.&quot; was an honorary title in common use by lawyers in Austria) is a sublime example of that happy merging. Mayer was an enthusiastic practitioner, teacher, and proponent of bromoil process photography - a method that allows for a freedom of expression via a series of laborious chemical  manipulations of the negative, and produces a monochrome print that has a softly grainy appearance, and a sort of quietude, in addition to effective, evocative  painterly depth.   From this collection and the essays that accompany it one comes to understand Mayer had the soul (and the eye) of an artist, and the patience and skill of a scientist. The results are terrific.<br />Rudolf Arnheim's Foreword offers an elegant preview of these atmospheric documentary  photographs of a vanished time and place:  turn-of-the-century Vienna, a city and a culture that has been called a &quot;uniquely civilized world.&quot;<br />Edward Rosser's sensitive accompanying biographical essay,  &quot;The Life and Art of Dr. Emil Mayer,&quot; is both an appreciation  and a fine critical piece. Mayer, a Jew,  was born in 1871 in Bohemia. His family moved to prosperous, bourgeois Vienna when he was a child. He was well-educated, and became a lawyer and a passionate hobbyist photographer, leading a large Viennese amateur photography club for  20 years, from 1907 to 1927. Mayer published numerous monographs (some in the US) on bromoil process.<br />Rosser explains that Hitler's annexation of Austria intervened, however.  In  June 1938  Mayer and his wife committed suicide. Their possessions, including of course most of his photographs, were confiscated, lost, or destroyed. Rosser's essay elaborates: Many if not all of the Europeans who would have remembered him after the war fell victim to the Holocaust themselves. Mayer's disappearance, then, was nearly assured in a scenario replicated - unthinkably and by the millions - in our time.<br />But in fact Mayer's photographs were rediscovered, and the facts of his  life reconstructed by the hard work and efforts of several people (credited in Rosser's essay).<br />The complete portfolio of the 51 photographs in this collection reside in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. They are of everyday street life - a sort that vanished with the coming of the First World War. They are portraits: at least one interesting person is in each.  People conduct all sorts of business on the streets. Horses pull wagons and coaches.  (Most everyone wears a hat, a cap, or a kerchief - and aside from a group of men in bowlers, the hats are quite thrilling - to this modern eye). The cobblestone streets are for people, goods, and horses - and there are many. The profusion of things to buy and to sell,  so emblematic of the bourgeois ideal that was Vienna,  caught Mayer's eye - and caught mine, too.<br />This book engaged, challenged, and delighted me. Anyone with an interest in European street life at the turn of the century, in the deep and absorbing technique known as bromoil process, and the sensitive, artful,  and deeply humane photography of a man who very nearly disappeared - will appreciate this fine book.	2001-05-18

Like their author they are approachable and unpretentious. She explains in her Preface, &quot; I seem to write continually about politics, the arts, and women's equality. But I am not ashamed of my concurrent interest in real estate, diet, and my mother.&quot; It is at the confluence of her dozen or so passions that one is so helplessly and happily drawn in.<br /> Wasserstein's many  concerns - all delightfully described -  range from the ridiculous (dieting, Manhattan real estate, Hollywood stars) to the sublime: family (especially Mom and sisters),  friends, personal history, New York theater (she adores it, and has since childhood), the importance of art to education and to life. &quot;For children, the arts are not simply icing on the cake. They are a way of including everyone in a joint, and joyous, venture.&quot;  In addition: love, loyalty, and the terrific inner (and outer) life of their author. She has a lot of great friends, and they say some very funny things sometimes.  She has never married, and has a take on that state of affairs that is a pleasure to read.<br />Wasserstein chronicles the harrowing (because premature and complicated, necessitating many good doctors and a group of supportive friends ) birth of her daughter - and the months following - in &quot; Days of Awe: The Birth of Lucy Jane,&quot; a piece that is at once poignant, full of information, and at times, so funny as to provoke a side ache.<br />The Wasserstein family of origin is a constant source of humor and is reflected upon with tenderness that is never cloying - just full of love.<br />I loved this collection and marvel at the ability of its author to talk so smartly and passionately about herself, to care deeply about improving the world, and to work toward that end - while at the same time conveying quite clearly to the reader that when she's through, she'll be right there - in orderto hear what might be your own very interesting story. A great read.	2001-05-13

Several additional and valuable pieces appear in this new edition.<br />Leslie Farber was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst (not, as the blurb on the back of the book says, a psychologist) with a private practice, professional affiliations, and a passion for thinking and writing about the ways of the psyche, culture, art and literature, and a variety of other concerns. In his life as in his practice he was nonconformist,  original, thoughtful, deeply humane - and well-loved by many. He died of a heart condition in 1981. (Unmentioned in this book.)  <br />His essays are unusual and wholly original - not just for the playful and deeply creative ways that he writes about psychic matters, but  for his radical departure from the prevailing language and comparative abstruseness of most psychoanalytic writing of his time. It can be said that Farber began a trend (that Adam Phillips most of all, continues) of pleasurable and readable psychoanalytic essays that embrace literature,  history, popular currents, and are intended to thrill with their elegance, their psychic playfulness (and rigor - at once) and  their process - as well as for their conclusions.<br />Some of his writing appeared in the popular press (Harper's, Commentary, The New Republic, and others). There is a compelling  playfulness to his method. Some of his pet themes are jealousy, envy, lust, sex, despair, suicide, lying and truth-telling, love and its attendant difficulties.  Some titles of his essays: &quot;I'm Sorry, Dear&quot; - - on the expectations that the sexology movement engendered; &quot;O Death, Where is Thy Sting-a-Ling?&quot; - on death and dying; &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; - more on the life of couples. Henry Stack Sullivan, schizophrenia, will and anxiety - are additional subjects. <br />There are thirteen essays. To read them is to get a good picture of Farber's amazing mind and method. &quot;Lying on the couch,&quot; first published in 1975,  begins by noting that deliberate lying -  as psychopathology or just bad form - has historically been ignored in the psychoanalytic literature. Freud, however, expelled a member of his inner circle for just this vice. Farber quotes the text of that pink slip, and then proceeds with a discussion on lying, on &quot;dubious revelation,&quot; on the panoply of reasons, justification, and excuses for lying. It's a great read.<br />The big topic of 'will' (its predecessor is Victorian 'will power') was one of Farber's large concerns. Sexuality - its freight of complexities (&quot;the failure of dialogue&quot;)  and complications, as well as the transformational power of its full expression -  are explored in several essays.  &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; is one of many gems.<br />Of Farber's compelling style and substance, Adam Phillips has written: &quot;Out of languages at odds with each other, if not actually at war with each other - the languages of Freud, of Sullivan, of Buber; of autobiography, of existentialism, of phenomenology, of a too-much-protested-against romanticism - Farber has found a way of being at once easily accessible to his readers, and surely but subtly unusually demanding of them.&quot; These essays, along with Robert Boyer's excellent Introduction and Anne Farber's Afterword (an essay that is also a tender remembrance) show us how he did it.	2001-05-09

She chose &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (later on, &quot;Lysistrata,&quot; &quot;A Doll's House,&quot; and &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;) for its potential to challenge and instruct - and because of her hunch that the women who participated in her classes might benefit immeasurably  from art and the intense experience of learning to make theater - and actually doing it, as a team.  <br />The experience was much larger and emotionally affecting for all involved than she could have predicted:  both she and her six participants were transformed by  this ambitious, consciousness-raising and, ultimately, healing endeavor.<br />Trounstine describes the project from its beginnings: it's a class some sign up for to alleviate crushing boredom - or because it's an alternative they prefer to aerobics class or volleyball. Trounstine introduces the (future) cast members: Dolly, Bertie, Kit, Rose, Rhonda, and Mamie, each in her own chapter.  There's not a lot about their lives before incarceration (prison authorities frown on Trounstine's knowing any histories),  and much more about who they are - and who they become -  in acting class. The women learn the art of improvisation: initially skeptical,  but soon with real commitment. They  literally expand their consciousnesses via these exercises; they erxperience the thrill of a true group effort,  and then their view of what is possible. It's a joy to watch - and to read about. <br />The vicissitudes of prison life are center stage, as are and the ups and downs of the women's personal relationships within and outside of the class. Trounstine is not naïve in  her respect for,  and sensitivity to, her students. She is the best kind of teacher. Later, she suggests readingmaterial and is frustrated by prison rules that are constant roadblocks, she feels, to inmate welfare. Some of her students have serious chronic health problems. She is often moved to tears by what she hears and sees<br />Trounstine's reporting method includes lengthy verbatim conversations. Readers who enjoy dialogue will not be disappointed: the voices are here, clear as day. In addition Trounstine is generous to a fault in the sharing of her impressions and thoughts along the way. The story is moving and important and a convincing plea for the ability of art and education to transform lives. Not surprisingly, this book and the story it tells make a convincing case for significant changes to American women's prisons.	2001-05-04

Editor Wendy Maltz has collected 120 poems, from various times and places,  on the not at all small topic of sexual love. Maltz explains in her Introduction  that she has spent a lot of years pondering the subject -  in her work and her life. In addition,  Maltz loves poetry and is eager to promote its inestimable ability  to provoke desire, describe physical and emotional states  -  and above all else express what may have hitherto been inexpressible. This collection meets her goals.<br />It is 'erotica,' and these terrific poems are definitely and unabashedly about the real thing. Should you leave it around the house? If you don't object to teenagers (for example) reading poetry of sexual experience that promotes love and some sweetness along with the passion - you can most assuredly leave it around the house. There is no gender bias or sexual orientation bias, although there is also no overt campaigning, either.<br />There is  flirtation and  playfulness (Nikki Giovanni's 'That Day&quot;: &quot; if you've got the key/then I've got the door&quot;). Intense sensuality (Sharon Olds, Walter Benton, David Watts, Neil Carpathias, Laura Gourlay - among many more.) The reader is treated to ways of talking about love and sex that are fresh and surprising. One poem (by Renaissance poet  Johannes Secundas) has been translated from Latin. Powerful stuff - that would have enlivened many a Latin class.<br />Unfortunately there is no information on the contributors other than the fulfillment of the  legal requirement of Permissions Acknowledgements.  The reader is left to his or her own devices to find out more. The title sounds faintly oxymoronic. In addition the poems are presented without dates of either composition or publication. No index of first lines, either.  Wonderful poets such as these deserve the kid-glove treatment, and all the publicity they can get. These gripes aside, this is a book of poetry thatis well worth reading and rereading.	2001-05-01

Evelyn Lehman Ryan, 'contestor' extraordinaire,  claimed that her inspiration (thousands of them) hit while she was at her perpetually-in-use ironing board. Evelyn Ryan kept a notebook at the ready, and jotted jingles, rhymes, ditties, and ideas constantly. The house was full of box tops, some culled by picking through people's trash. She often involved the kids in the fun - and taught them a lot about life in the process.  This was while caring for ten children on a tiny bit of income,  walking everywhere she needed to go (she did not drive), hatching ingenious and workable schemes,  yelling herself hoarse at her sons' baseball games, gently evading, placating, or satisfying creditors, advocating for her kids at school (where despite being bright - terrific - kids, some were assigned to 'Special Education' for Freshman year in high school -  thanks to the ignorance of the nuns at the kids' Catholic school.)   She inspired each child on a daily basis, taught them to care for one another - and found time to love animals, too.  An Easter chick grew into an obnoxious rooster named Charley, hellion of the yard but affectionate and loyal to one person: Evelyn.  A wounded baby sparrow was nursed back to health, allowed to live indoors for a spell - and subsequently bonded to her so well that a visitor to the house asked her if she knew that she had a bird in her hair.<br />When Playtex stopped making her favorite girdle, she returned to her ironing board with parts salvaged from her worn-out ones. Using her iron she melted seams together to craft new girdles.  The kids were familiar with the smell of burning rubber. She had no social life beyond kids until she met a group of women contesters - and her world opened delightfully.  Maneuvering around a rather immature, alcoholic and often bitterly disappointing husband and father took some doing, too. Evelyn's well-thought-out rationale for sticking it out- with grace and forgiveness - is included in this book. And to the author's credit, she explores that relationship just enough, avoiding shortcuts or easy ways out.<br />Terry Ryan sustains a young and wholly sincere voice throughout this beautiful memoir that is pure and clear. This is not about &quot;nostalgia,&quot; or about sugar-coating pain. It is also not about victimhood. It is a story about her mom first, and then the amazing family that was nurtured by her.  Ryan reports on life in her family so well that  I was completely transported to the 1950's and the small-town Midwestern world of the Ryans, Although  rich beyond measure in love, talent, energy, and brainpower,  they were truly poverty-stricken  (sometimes not a nickel could be found) a good deal of the time.  I loved this story and the very interesting family in it.	2001-04-29

The conceit - a barely-managed 'memoir' of someone other than the memoirist - is ingenious. Who hasn't had a great idea that just wouldn't work out? This one, in Maddox's hands, allows for plenty of room for antics on several levels. The narrator is one of those people who has read so much, and thought about a lot of things, and his mind is buzzing. He contrives (at first) to write in a voice not his own. He sustains the invention for brief spates. He can't sustain the voice, and he knows it at times. He collapses, then perseveres. Repeatedly but not tediously, he nearly runs away with himself. <br />Maddox inserts himself into the life span of his not-at-all believable heroine when you would expect it, as well as when you might not. (Think of a puppy who cannot stay away from the action for long.) Since he knows his heroine insufficiently, subplots and diversions intrude. There's a sort of manic braininess here.  This is an unpretentious romp, uncynical and a bona fide comic novel. It's utterly original and a lot of fun.	2001-04-26

As an adolescent he finds himself confused about his sexuality, and afraid - of girls, of boys, of a disappointed mom, a dad who has left - of feelings in general. He has a deeply complicated relationship to his father, a good man who has gone to live with a man. Giardina's narrator, Luca Carcera, reports calmly, carefully, and reasonably - from the eye of the storm. Despite an inner life that from childhood has been constrained by the keeping of a series of secrets, Luca's world brims with friends, relatives, and lovers.<br />Luca's considerable conflicts are of the yearning for love and connection, of desire versus the longing for acceptance and the safety of conventionality, and some real confusion regarding his sexuality, and - ultimately - of how to live. Countless other protagonists in similar straits have been encouraged by authors  to drink like fish, wreck cars, abandon families and betray lovers. Giardina's narrator fights his battles quite differently, with a quietude and a respect for those who would love him. That is some of why this story is well worth reading.<br />Luca's urge to live honestly competes agonizingly with his desire to hide.  There are moving and poignant descriptions of people and inner states. The suburban milieu of Luca's childhood is memorably rendered. There is no misogynism, and no homophobia. Transcendent (hetero)sexual love would seem to be Luca's goal, yet throughout this novel desire is muted, and during lovemaking with women, Luca's mind is often elsewhere.<br />There are several unintentionally disturbing aspects to this novel, among then a narrative that is sometimes too quiet; less than convincingly drawn Italian and (especially) Jewish ethnicity; the not-quite believable sexual transformation that the protagonist  experiences, and the finale, which left me frankly worried.  I am not sure if that is what Giardina intended.  Still and all, well worth reading, because Luca Carcera is someone well worth knowing.	2001-04-20

He grew up as the hearing child of Deaf parents  in New York's South Bronx, where his parents, he reports, &quot;were as good as any other person in the South Bronx, which is to say they were pretty badly off.&quot;<br />Chapter Four, &quot;Nationalism and Deafness: The Nineteenth Century&quot; offers historic perspectives on deafness, including the fact that by the beginning of the nineteenth century, sign language had become a transnational language. Anyone fluent in sign language could communicate with any other signer - worldwide. This is no small thing. The Deaf &quot;became a subgroup within each state throughout Europe.&quot; Some additional topics are: oralism and sign language, disability, class, nationalism, eugenics, politics, poverty, industrialization, and health. The bigger concepts of inclusion and exclusion are touched upon, too. <br />&quot;Deafness and Insight&quot; is a challenging and complex chapter in which Davis explores &quot;deafness as a critical modality.&quot; A main assertion throughout this book is that the concept of the &quot;normal&quot; body informs cultural assumptions about art, literature, and the totality, in fact, of culture.<br />Other chapters with much to offer and challenge the reader are &quot;Universalizing Marginality,&quot; in which Davis explores the reasons behind the intense cultural and philosophical interest during the European eighteenth century of deafness. Health and 'fitness,' images of the 'normal' and the not-normal body, and the fact that disability is most often an acquired thing (you get hurt or get old - and wind up with a 'disability.') are investigated. Art, literature, and media are cited with success.<br />This is a book that is thought-provoking, remarkably informative, and completely worth the effort it requires. Dr. Davis'world view is clearly presented and wholly graspable. His  methods of analysis are consistently intellectually muscular, Occasionally he ventures into academic methodologies that are a bit out of the range of the common reader. Tough stuff, and worth the effort. Many pages of endnotes, a (long) list of works cited, and a very good index.	2001-04-19

Discover Who You Are by Looking at What You Eat	Books	4	14	14	N	N	The nose knows - or at least takes good guesses	This book is really about the world of smell first, taste second -  and the findings, meanings, ramifications, and just plain weird and thrilling things neurologists, psychiatrists, educators, and all sorts of additional folks have learned in the past several decades about olfactory stimuli. <br />Dr. Alan Hirsch is a neurologist and a psychiatrist, and has published a study entitled &quot;Effects of Garlic Bread and Family Interactions.&quot; He has my vote.  The results of that study, and a series of other, equally engaging ones (on migraines and fragrance, firefighters' loss of smell, nostalgia, the effects of &quot;malodors&quot; and more)  are included in the wonderful appendix of this very entertaining book.<br />Considering the wealth of understanding and information that Hirsch has at his disposal, this book is a bit &quot;lite, &quot; and the chapter on meat is quite general. But the narrative seems to be grounded in Hirsh's research, and in his especially playful and hopeful sense of human possibility. <br />In addition, Hirsch mentions some strange and interesting things: for example,  research into humans and smell has shown that certain floral smells are stimulating, ever so slightly anxiety-provoking, and therefore  promote learning in test subjects. (Your third grade teacher who &quot;smelled good&quot; may actually have enhanced your ability to learn - by wearing perfume.)  Male chefs - for a variety of reasons -  have senses of smell that are often less acute than the diners in the restaurant.  In order to make foods &quot;taste like themselves,&quot;  artificial flavoring often does the trick better than natural flavorings. Men and women have very different noses. (Men, think twice about taking a female date to a barbecue.)  If someone &quot;smells right,&quot; it's a very, very good thing - for a developing relationship. Likewise, the &quot;wrong&quot; smell jinxes things - utterly. However, men are turned off by many fewer smells than are women.<br />Much of research has been done by Hirsch. The index is a bit scanty, but on the other hand I have no idea how he managed in this book to describe me to a T based on my preferences in food and odors. I pestered family and friends and they, too, were impressed with his on-target analysis of their psyches and behaviors - based on food and odor preferences.  <br />This book is a lot of fun.	2001-04-11

He provides an overview and defines the field and its terms. Davis cites many of the developers and 'early' thinkers (ancient times to the present) of  disability studies and,  in summary, asserts that Disability Studies is not about &quot;sensitizing&quot; &quot;normal&quot; persons. Disability Studies is, rather, &quot;in favor of advocacy, investigation, inquiry, archeology, genealogy, dialectic, and deconstruction.&quot; <br />The book (which does not have to be read in any particular order)  is divided into  seven main sections: &quot;Historical Perspectives,&quot; &quot;Politics of Disability,&quot; &quot;Stigma and Illness,&quot; &quot;Gender and Disability,&quot; &quot;Disability and Education,&quot; &quot;Disability and Culture,&quot; and finally a small section of fiction and poetry.<br />Davis' &quot;Constructing Normalcy&quot; appears first, appropriately so, for in my view it's really required reading. There is a generous selection of essays on Deafness and Deaf culture. (Davis himself grew up as the child of Deaf parents).   Some of my favorite essays: Harlan Hahn's &quot;Advertising the Acceptably Employable Image,&quot; on the relationship between capitalism and disability; Susan Wendell's deeply personal and thoughtful &quot;Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability,&quot; in which she points out, &quot;When you listen to this culture in a disabled body, you hear how often health and physical vigor are talked about as if they were moral virtues.&quot;  Susan Sontag writes on AIDS and metaphor. &quot;Blindness and Art&quot; by Nicholas Mirzoeff is complex, difficult, and worth the effort. In addition there are a number of incredibly powerful historical discussions.<br />This is a terrific textbook - for it contains a wealth of material that is challenging and engaging. Readers interested in this field and its ideas will be pleased.  As a reference work it'll  doubtless be useful for many years. It's solid and complex,  and definitely worth reading.	2001-04-09

You could memorize these scenarios and their protocols, but more likely you will not. The phrases-for-the-terrorized section is my favorite. It includes multilingual versions of requests such as &quot;Please do not hurt me&quot; and &quot;Please take me to a clean hospital,&quot; as well as a variety of courteous pleas that one might imagine would be of use in a dire, horrific emergency.  But what, really is the point? It's entertaining and bizarre and silly. Also great reading for the Indiana Joneses - or the Walter Mittys - of the world who would never (for example) need to stop a runaway camel or save themselves or another in a fall through ice - because we just would never be there in the first place. The sources are impressive: the scorpions information comes from an entomologist who is also an Army major, and the section on surviving a swim among the piranhas credits a leader of Amazon (the river) tours. Each terrible possibility and its antidote seems well-researched. Not a good travel gift for any but the toughest folks, but nerve-wracking fun nonetheless.	2001-04-04

So, for example, in an essay about the school-uniforms discussion in New York City, she starts out by noting that the &quot;public school systen has libraries without books,&quot; that a girl was killed in one school by falling debris - and then, later - she is onto the school uniforms debate - in perspective. If you read the Nation, these essays are a terrific reprise. If you don't, you will find that they are smart, brief (a few pages at most; think of a long, utterly incisive newspaper editorial), and for students, a series of very good examples of political writing. Humor, wit, and a high level of caring about the things that matter. Some are grounded in the politics and goings-on of New York City, where Pollitt lives,  but many are of national (and international) interest. Great collection.	2001-04-02

Without one, the other loses form - and meaning. Each and both are his focus here, and he manages in this book to ably wear two hats:  that of an enthusiastically literary (he read English as an undergraduate) psychotherapist, and also an essayist on literary topics who is - not at all by accident - unapologetically psychoanalytically-oriented. He is playful and he writes with clarity and precision. You never puzzle out a Phillips sentence; you reread because you were pleased the first time. In addition his clinical experiences (as a child psychotherapist) inform some of the pieces.<br />Sometimes he is elegantly simple - to set the hook,  and is almost epigrammatic, as when he asserts, &quot;One way of describing growing up would be to say that it involves a transition from the imperative to the interrogative - from 'Food!' to 'I want' - to 'Can I have?'&quot; In addition, the Phillips knack for successfully and bracingly arguing both sides of a story is out in full force.  <br />Some of the subjects under discussion are poetry and psychoanalysis; narcissism (not such a bad thing); anorexia nervosa; clutter (as &quot;the obstacle to desire&quot; and the &quot;object of desire&quot;);  agoraphobia; poet Frederick Seidel's one book of published poems; grief and melancholy; jokes, and an appreciation of Martin Amis (which jauntily starts out, &quot;For three words once, in 1987, Martin Amis sounded like D.H. Lawrence.&quot;) Several (among them &quot;Christopher Hill's Revolution and Me&quot;) are autobiographical, and all are thoroughly engaging. <br />There are 28 essays. Some are book reviews.  Some discuss writers or thinkers I'd never read. One of Phillips' abilities is to reference someone with whom you are unfamiliar,  and make that person come alive in the course of the essay. You will not be lost, or lose interest.<br />You can dip into this book, come back to it, skip around, or steam through it. Phillips is flexible, and so is this collection. From Phillips' essay on American psychotherapist and essayist Leslie Farber, in which he mentions Farber's writing style: &quot;Out of languages at odds with each other, if not actually at war with each other -  the languages of Freud, of Sullivan, of Buber; of autobiography, of existentialism, of phenomenology, of a too-much-protested-against romanticism - Farber has found a way of being at once easily accessible to his readers, and surely but subtly unusually demanding of them.&quot;  Phillips was also describing himself.<br />A very worthwhile book.	2001-03-25
US	51725472	R2UOMN20KAHZDU	0767904303	358488108	Kindred Spirits: How the Remarkable Bond Between Humans and Animals Can Change the Way We Live	Books	5	36	38	N	N	Thoughts of a soulful caregiver	Allen Schoen is a kind and compassionate veterinarian who from childhood has felt an intense bond with animals, and a mission to heal them. He is interested in service and sprituality, and  is also a clear thinker.  One of the best things about this book is that Schoen has a real, live, active veterinary practice, large and small animals, and shares it with the reader.  Beneath his sweet and tender heart and soulful approach is sheer bedrock:  the fact that he has (for example) gone out in the middle of a freezing cold night to drive miles to a barn, scrubbed, put on gloves, hunkered down in straw, and reached into a laboring animal in critical trouble - to aid in a birth. You are reading a man who walks the walk. His redoubtable philosophy is grounded in his career.<br />In vet school Schoen met with resistance to many of his convictions regarding the humane treatment of lab animals. As a practicing veterinarian, he bumped into similar resistance regarding humane treatment of  livestock in particular.  He shares generously - and without prejudice. Sometimes things don't always turn out in agreement with his beliefs, and he writes of them, too.<br />In this engaging book Dr. Schoen treats the reader to contemporary American versions of James Herriot-style adventures  (heart-stopping rescues, birthing stories, and a tale about a dachshund-owning woman who ended up presenting what Schoen, in a great play on words,  calls &quot;Munchhausen by Dachsie&quot;) - with a generous helping of intelligent contributions on topics ranging from the increase of food allergies in animals; disorders of the immune system; how to &quot;think like an animal&quot;; cancer; aging and ailing, and the role of love, touching, meditation, and mindfulness in humans' best efforts to facilitate healing in their animals. Finally, he offers good advice on what to do when no more can be done. <br />This book has much to offer readers interested in bettering the lives of their animals. I would addthat some, if not many, of Schoen's opinions regarding animal consciousness and the 'rightness' of humane treatment of animals are much more widely accepted today than when Schoen entered veterinary school. This book is valuable for its message of connectedness, hopefulness, and love. To that end it joins a number of other voices who have also called for those virtues. Dr. Schoen's obvious wealth of clinical experience contributes considerable muscle to this worthwhile book.	2001-03-18

The photographs themselves form a true treasure trove that can't help but enchant dog lovers and fans of Victorian photography. There is more, however, that makes this book so good. For starters, Libby Hall contributes a brief and egoless Introduction - how she started this collection, what it means to her, and why she wants to share it. Perfect. Then there are the postcards, reproduced in their original sepia tones, and captionless - as they should be.<br />What about the dogs? Hardly a leash on these dogs (I counted only two). The dogs sit on tables, chairs, laps, in baby carriages. In one card, a little boy sits on his dog. Women with their dogs. Men in a group, with a dog. Embarrassment of riches: one man poses beside his wife and dog, with his parrot on his shoulder. The canine faces stay with you for a long time. This is a gem of a book. It's always a real treat when a collector can curate well, too. The simple act of restraint - of not captioning these photographs, which wisely enables the viewer to wordlessly experience these dogs and people - transforms this sweet and humble collection into something great.	2001-03-16

Riv-Ellen Prell is a committed academic and her passionate interest in her subject is obvious. In addition she is a clear thinker and terrific at conveying complex ideas without being the least bit reductive.<br />There's an  historic and political framework for Dr. Prell's topics, among them: the damage done to Jewish men and women by stereotyping both from within and without (additional American ethnic groups might take note);  historic sources of class prejudice within the group; the resentment of (Jewish) newcomers and attempts to restrict immigration; changes in the workplace and in workplace participation; changes in expectations and practices - regarding romantic love, courtship, and marriage; the rearing of children; urban and suburban life; class and intra-religious aspirations; Jewish humor in the '50's; popular culture's reinforcement of intermarriage; changes in religious practice. Chapter Six is a detailed and smart deconstruction of the Jewish American Princess stereotype.  <br />There is a terrific attention to detail throughout - and that is part of what makes this book so satisfying. Clothing colors, the specifics of living situations,  food, ads and media, and most effective:  a &quot;typical&quot; - self-revealing and moving - adolescent diary of Lois Greene,  an 'ordinary' American  teenager born in 1932, who gave her wonderful diary to the American Jewish Historical Society in 1988.  It's in good hands, here. <br />Films are brought into this interesting discussion, to good effect. &quot;Abie's Irish Rose&quot; for starters. &quot;The White Palace,&quot; &quot;Dirty Dancing,&quot; &quot;Crossing Delancey,&quot; &quot;Private Benjamin,&quot; among others. Dr. Prell has also thought deeply about novels (immigrant lit. and  American novels) jokes, advertising culture, and media's contributions to issues of self-image, self-esteem, and assimilation. <br />There are over fifty pages of notes plus an index. This is a serious study and a great read.	2001-03-16

It's a riot of visual stimulation - for a reason I couldn't fathom. The various font sizes (six point all the way up to 72 or so - white,, greys, black, squeezed close, far apart, italic, bold)  present a visual challenge. Pages are variously white, pale grey, medium grey, black. Text is superimposed on photographs. The effect of the half-tones, great-big, teeny-weeny, moody/chipper/quiet/loud art and design is a feeling of confusion, and then - a suspicion that this is a comparatively big hullaballoo over very little. The quotations can for the most part be found in a variety of other collections. (Some of the best ones are from F. Scott Fitsgerald's notes and diaries, published years ago as &quot;The Crack Up.&quot; ) I found it disturbing that sometimes a truly small thought is presented in big font size. In addition, the names of the authors of the remarks are often so small (or pale) as to provoke eyestrain. One page 82, for example, Shakespeare and Raymond Chandler are paired. The unfortunate coupling minimizes each author's remarks on insomnia. <br />The editors occasionally contribute their own glib observations, and more often than not they come off as self-congratulatory and narrowly focused. They contribute some remarks on REM sleep (among them &quot;Kittens on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,&quot; and a suggestion that you experiment on your bed partner by &quot;accidentally&quot; waking him or her up when you see a twitching of the eyelids) that are actually downright bothersome.<br />A disappointing read.	2001-03-15

Some of them have oiled skin, or are wet. This is doctrinaire stuff: fairly routine gay male erotica (albeit rated PG-13 - because detumescent.) There's a stultifying sensibility amidst the 'come-hither' poses and angles in use here. The Mapplethorpian conventions are all here: buttocks, genitals, abs, biceps, quads. No eye contact. I was bored, because I had hoped for interesting photography,and a sense of the human beings inside the bodies - and instead got a parade of 'perfect' physiques -in conventional poses.	2001-03-15

Since she is a fan of plants and gardens I had hoped that we could walk the grounds - quietly and appreciatively. Instead my friend chattered incessantly for the entire hour and a half we were there. Each plant provoked a monologue: anecdotes, jokes, asides, and factual material in an ultimately maddening cacophonous symphony. This book had the same effect on me. You are awed by the quiet beauty of Rene Eisenbart's paintings, you know that the plants described are great,  but the text is so talky as to be distracting - and even annoying. If you enjoy a lot of off-topic opinions and chat about all sorts of things, then this is the book for you. If you want to study and enjoy beautiful plants in a quieter frame of mind, look elsewhere.	2001-03-14

In addition he is often saving the day for his characters, and he is humble.<br />These stories are great and short (as in, most are ten or fewer pages long) but each with a distinct purpose. You also find out that the narrator's brother, now schizophrenic, was once a Professor of Philosophy - and that Kostman knows an important moment when he meets one. He likes people, and they like him. You understand why.<br />This is a fine collection of stories that are unpretentious, elegantly simple, and very humane.	2001-03-13

She brings this brainy, sturdy, and playful approach  to this book, too. She is self-aware but not self-absorbed. It's a pleasure. This is not a polemic either in support of or against animal rights. It is a serious conversation regarding the yardsticks used to define and then assess animal intelligence. <br />Dr. Yoerg is especially interested in the origins and the meaning of the persistent human urge to order the animal world.  What is animal intelligence?,  she asks, and then, even more importantly, Why has it been so important to our society to measure it? She asserts that the ancient (and contemporary) urge to design a hierarchy of intelligence ( usually God first, man next, then apes, and so on) says more about us  than about the animals that behavioral and biological research has (often foolishly) refused to observe in context, but instead has sent through mazes, tested in boxes, and hypothesized in a variety of ways over time - for a variety of reasons. Sometimes deeply-held beliefs are turned on their ear. For example it is widely assumed that sheep flocks respond to herding dogs, who in turn are responding to the rancher's  whistle. But Gujarti shepherds in India &quot;whistle just like their British counterparts&quot; while the dogs often sleep. The  sheep respond to the shepherd's whistle. The dogs protect the flocks from predators - but the sheep &quot;herd&quot; themselves.<br />Dr. Yoerg supplies the reader with some surprising tidbits. &quot;During the Middle Ages, all sorts of creatures were convicted of criminal behavior and tried by the courts,&quot; and later, &quot;In 1386 a sow was convicted of the murder of a child and was led to the public execution dressed in man's clothes.&quot; (pp. 71-2) Her point is that human opinions regarding the animal world have been a highly mutable thing - subject to religion, politics, economics, and emotion.<br />Dr. Yoerg offers a reasonably detailed historic overview of this contentious field - from Aristotle to the middle ages to Darwin, the behaviorists, the Germans and Gestalt theory as advanced by Wolfgang Kohler,  cognitive psychology, and many more. In addition, rather than being a collection of 'things you might not have known about animals,' it is an orderly and thoughtful discussion.<br />There is sly humor (why doesn't a dog use a mirror to right an inside-out ear?) and  wealth of interesting information here - why some animals (the rat, the crow, the coyote and the fox for example) are comparatively unpopular in the US - and are reputed to be 'cunning,' 'wily,' 'crafty,' and 'sneaky,' whereas others (dogs, cats, squirrels)  are more often described as 'clever,' 'smart,' or 'cute.' (Disney and Warner Brothers and TV have a lot to do with it, Dr. Yoerg asserts.) Animal research - and the fact that our pets kill other animals. (Quoting another writer, A.H. Herzog: &quot;If each pet cat in the US ate only two mice, chipmunks, or baby birds each year, the number of animals slaughtered by pets would greatly exceed the number of animals used for research.&quot;)  Neoteny - the existence of juvenile features (big eyes, round head - the cuteness factor)  in the adult of the species- is a contributor, too, in human opinions about the species. The dicey matter of different cultures' treatment of the dog is discussed.  Notions of love and attachment - and a convincing send up of behaviorism - are included.. <br />Dr. Yoerg has taken a wide array of material and organized it and presented it in an accessible and lively way. She ranges widely and well.  The bibliography names over a hundred books and articles, and the index is excellent. She comes to no sweeping conclusions. Instead she has begun a variety of thoughtful and thought-provoking conversations. She's a terrific teacher. A great read.	2001-03-12

Sheila McGrath, in her Foreword, looks through a different lens, seeing &quot;an inborn and unyielding independence that must have been difficult to maintain,&quot; a wholly original woman who traveled, had adventures, made friends, and wrote about all of it with an unflagging energy and dedication. She lived exactly as she chose to, for her entire long life.<br />This book is a collection of essays that Hahn herself assembled in 1970, in order to fulfill a commitment she'd made to a publisher to produce an autobiography, which she was loathe to write, according to Cuthbertson. There are several delightful pieces on Hahn's good childhood and school days in the American midwest, and then the rest bright and incredible travel pieces - letters home, really -  that appeared in The New Yorker magazine, from 1937 to 1970. (One describes a cross-country trip she and a friend made one summer during the '20's,  as undergraduates, in a Model T).  Artful and sensitive ordering of these pieces  supplies the reader with a chronology. Unfortunately,  the pieces are undated, so you must guess as to date of writing, and date of publication.<br />Hahn's adventures and quirky and strong views are fabulous and charming - and quaint at times. From &quot;The Big Smoke&quot;: &quot;Though I had always wanted to be an opium addict, I can't claim that as a reason I went to China.&quot; She supplies a witty and  thorough description of how she did it. (And later, of how she kicked the habit.) In other venues she had a pet gibbon named Mr. Mills, she lived in the jungle for a while, and was literally trapped in Shanghai for a spell. Amazing things, reported in a calm - but playful - voice. The people she met and got to know are drawn less fully than her escapades. You, in turn, never really get to know them, either.<br />Hahn does not go deep so much as range far and wide. She has a great ear, an even better eye, and is fearless. That she reported so dryly and well on her doings in the US, the Congo, China, Japan, England and Europe is the icing on the cake. A very good and atmospheric read.	2001-03-11

Howard Kissel has compiled, or possibly combined, tapes in order to come up with these &quot;classes,&quot; or chapters.<br />Adler was an eloquent and reverential  philosopher of acting, a teacher and acting coach extraordinaire of Brando, de Niro, Warren Beatty, Harvey Keitel, Candice Bergen, and many more. As a young, serious actress she had traveled to Paris, in order to study with Konstantin Stanislavsky, founder of &quot;Method&quot; acting. She was his only American student. She brought his philosophy back to the US, but added her own considerable beliefs to it.  She cautions students: &quot;Don't read his book, because it makes absolutely no sense. He came from a culture entirely alien to yours, and you won't understand it.&quot; <br />The twenty-two classes are seemingly presented verbatim. Each 'class' forms a chapter, and has a named subject as its organizing principle.  (&quot;Acting is Doing,&quot; &quot;Developing the Imagination,&quot; Building a Vocabulary of Actions,&quot; &quot;Understanding the Text,&quot; Dressing the Part,&quot; &quot;Instant and Inner Justifications,&quot; etc.) Each class is clear, thoughtful and thought-provoking, and wonderfully stimulating. Adler focuses on meaning and the soul of the thing - at all times. In addition, she is delightfully concrete, so you are never lost in well-meaning platitudes. <br />Right off the bat, you are educated as to why acting is not a cousin to, for example,  fashion modeling. Adler is blunt, and supports her assertions. Acting has nothing to do with being &quot;discovered,&quot; it is not about fame or celebrity.  She bemoans the loss of the theater companies of mid-century, and the opportunities they provided to actors, who are now left to 'go it alone.'<br />To Adler acting is a labor of intelligence and will and love, a &quot;profession that is over 2000 years old&quot;  and one that requires boundless energy and a sort of selfish (but not narcissistic) ambition first, and then &quot;critical seeing, self-awareness, discipline, and self-control&quot; - for starters. She talks about the importance to an actor of the use of one's imagination, the disciplined willingness to actually do the research -in order to care deeply and conscientiously about the play. She asserts, &quot;A great disservice was done to American actors when they were persuaded that they had to experience *themselves* on the stage instead of experiencing the play. Your experience is not the same as Hamlet's - unless you too are a royal prince of Denmark. The truth of the character isn't found in you but in the circumstances of the royal position...

It was the canon, really, for middle class America. So I expected more than twenty-odd quick (though arresting) briefs filed from the various historic madhouses - that comprise this collection. Why so meager? The listing claims 229 pages. My edition has 175 plus an eight-page Introduction. In addition, quite a few of the selections have likely already been read by many, since they have been culled from American best-sellers of the past several decades.  As dark and important a subject as women and madness deserves more than this quick once-over.	2001-03-09

Grimke was a published author of plays, short stories, and poetry. Dunbar-Nelson was an editor, poet, and journalist, and an important hostess to the famous and not-so-famous personalities of her time. Johnson was an educator, an assured formalist poet and a considerable social force with a memorable and important salon. Despite the minimization of Johnson's contributions in, for example the 1932 edition of &quot;Who's Who in Colored America,&quot; in which she is listed as &quot;housewife/writer,&quot; Dr. Hull is undaunted in her pursuit of the truthful meaning of these writers' full lives and contributions.<br />These writers led purposeful and productive writing and personal lives despite the fact that &quot;at no point in their lives did anyone ever provide them with leisure to write.&quot; (p. 10). In addition, Dr. Hull asserts that black women participants'  experience of the Harlem Renaissance had embedded in it the usual social tensions of caste and social class - plus the biggest handicap of all: femaleness. In most aspects, it was (not surprisingly) a man's world.<br />Dr. Hull  has done something wonderful here.  Photographs of each poet are included in the  wealth of biographical material. The research is deep, as is the interpretation. Texts are excerpted.  She has read letters, diaries, and a wealth of unpublished material. There is good historical and social context provided. This is a valuable, assured study. There are pages of notes, and a good index. <br />Definitely worth reading.	2001-03-08

He is a fast talker, too. These pieces appeared in monthly popular magazines, where likely he was the resident curmudgeon/ intellectual - albeit with a deadline. As he explains,  he spent enough time in academia, &quot;stuffing myself like a Christmas goose (Dickens) from the groaning board of books on the prescribed reading list&quot; to earn a doctorate in twentieth-century British literature and teach for awhile (at Vassar)  before moving &quot;up&quot; and out, into a job as a writer and mainstream critic. <br />  Mallon loves language's usefulness - sometimes as weaponry - and revels in his ability to use it well. There are lots of smart bits, arcana and literary and cultural trivia. He does his research, and then lays it all out for the reader. He loves proper nouns, too. Sometimes there are as many as twenty on a page. I actually wished for an index to somehow gather, at book's end, the many people, places, book titles, and other index-worthy things in this collection.   He sometimes goes for the jugular. (Dos Passos' &quot;unpunctuated Joycean singsong&quot;)  He can be mean and lacking in the sort of tact that (for example) an undergraduate might require - in order to ever write again.  It's not appealing, for example, when he savages David Guterson -not only his first novel, but his wholly extraliterary views on a variety of other things. Mallon can turn a phrase, but sometimes it would have been better not to. <br />In other places this long-knives approach is just what you want.  Regarding Mencken's reprehensible political views, during the 1930's, Mallon writes, &quot;These are less the genteel barbarities of another age that the eternal chant of the crazy who's just boarded the subway car.&quot;  On the other hand, when Mallon approves, he says so. (&quot;In 'The Ice Age' Margaret Drabble surveys England like a sociologist in a helicopter, a sort of digitalGeorge Eliot.&quot;)<br />In these pieces he is brainy, unforgiving, and approves, unfortunately, of comparatively few things. Good reading, but in measured doses.	2001-03-05

Her son, Porter Shreve, has his great own story to tell - as the bedeviled (and bedeviling) 'scholarship kid' at the school that employed his dad.  <br />There are 16 additional pieces in this somewhat uneven collection. All of the contributors are Americans; academics and/or professional writers.  More than a few grew up poor and felt ostracized -  and talk about that experience. The domestic debate regarding public versus private schools continues, with varying success, in several of these pieces. (Nina Revoyr, Francesca Delbanco, others). In some of the stories,  memories are likely fresh because the writer is only a decade or so away from the actual experience.   The  remembered pain and turmoil of adolescence combines is here.  Sherman Alexie's young life was under a long shadow: poverty, alcoholism, and an awful disconnect. Alexie's account - of Indian cruelty to Indians - is powerfully bitter. (He reports having asked a bulimic female classmate to &quot;Give me your lunch if you're just going to throw up.&quot; ) Immigrant experience, feelings of being an outsider for other reasons - and the ever-present threat of bullying and ostracism are here, too. Learning disabilities, sex, death, vandalism, parents, good and bad teachers - all present. Class conflict and political tension, too. Teachers have enormous powers  - to annoy and to hurt, but also to love and redeem. Michael Patrick MacDonald's &quot;Fight the Power&quot; offers an astonishing picture of violence in to-be-integrated South Boston that slyly compares it to Belfast.  Jeff Richards' essay &quot;LD&quot;talks about family, learning disabilities, persistence and love  - with honesty and passion. David Haynes writes, straightforwardly and well, about teaching - in the dark, really, at first, and by default. He says blithely but not flippantly that he had neglected to choose a profession, so he began to teach.<br />Class clown David Sedaris (&quot;I Like Guys&quot;)  does not fail to deliver - in one of the liveliest of the stories.<br />Definitely worth reading.	2001-02-28

The exhibition tackled questions of how assimilated postwar American Jews view themselves, how the larger culture (media in particular) has viewed them, and - with humor and utter seriousness, often together -  the awesome power of stereotyping on Jews as well as all peoples regarded as &quot;other.&quot;  There is serious analysis that is by turns insightful, imaginative, even fanciful - and fabulous and absorbing visuals, too.<br />The cover illustration is a detail from artist Deborah Kass' ironic silkscreen of  multiple Barbra Streisands as Yentl, in  &quot;Triple Silver Yentl (My Elvis).&quot; It's the tip of the iceberg. Other pieces (pictured in color) are similarly trenchant commentary. Art Spiegelman's  &quot;Preliminary Sketch for Maus: A Survivor's Tale&quot;; Ilene Seagalove's &quot;Jewish Boys,&quot;  Kenneth Goldsmith's memorial plaque - to Bob Dylan (also Allen Ginsberg and Abbie Hoffman), and more. There are eight essays, accompanied by color and black and white illustrations,  and 36 color plates - photos of the artwork of the exhibition -at the book's end.  It can hardly be considered only a catalogue. Norman Kleeblatt's overview,  &quot;'Passing' Into Multiculturalism&quot; is a great long essay that uses loads of examples from visual art and literature to make its points about the effect of perceptions of 'otherness' and its companion, assimilation.  Art historian Margaret Olin writes on Clement Greenberg, formalist criticism, and Jewish identity. Dr. Riv-Ellen Prell contributes a powerful essay on desire, female body image and the effects of stereotyping, and Rhonda Lieberman's &quot;Jewish Barbie&quot; also addresses (funnily) the struggle for self-esteem and self-worth within a culture that so powerfully values - insists upon - conventional notions of  consumerism, beauty, and sexuality. Maurice Berger's comprehensive and insightful  &quot;The Mouse That Never Roars: Jewish Masculinity on Television,&quot; though ending pre-&quot;Seinfeld,&quot;  has much to offer. Students of television and pop culture should take note.  Many writers, thinkers, and artists have a say in this book. Wendy Wasserstein, David Mamet, Jackie Mason  are here, along with hundreds more.  Essays and graphics  address issues of beauty, pleasure, the body and sexuality, conformity, religion, consumerism and material culture. Beneath the surface is the Yiddish world of the past, its physical and psychic persistence in the present - and much more. The art is often funny, and always articulate - and brave.<br />There are artists' biographies and an extensive bibliography. A terrific contribution to Jewish studies, gender studies, 'multicultural' studies.	2001-02-27
US	51725472	R1IIUGHOLAU686	0802130771	413564677	A Personal Anthology	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Borges' anthology of his work	Jorge Luis Borges was born in Buenos Aires in 1899. His parents, multilingual intellectuals, would soon travel to Europe with their children  in the hopes of finding medical treatment for the progressive (inherited) failing eyesight that Borges' father was experiencing. Borges was a brainy, precocious, nearsighted and bookish child who was deeply attached to his sister Norah,  with whom he played nearly exclusively and happily, mainly in the protected indoors of  the family's library, or in the garden, and at the Buenos Aires Zoo, where Borges adored tigers most of all. (Stroking the fur of a living tiger was a lifelong dream and one that he finally attained - in old age).<br />Borges wrote his first short story at age six and, amazingly,  at the age of nine translated Oscar Wilde's short story &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; from English to Spanish, publishing the story in a local newspaper. It was simply assumed that his father (also &quot;Jorge Borges&quot;) had done the translation.  Borges was educated in the classics, was multilingual, and was eventually named Director of the National Library of Argentina. The irony of being blind - and also in direct control of &quot;800,000 volumes&quot; did not escape him. <br />This book was assembled by Borges himself, in the 1960s.  It's an assortment of  short stories, essays, fictions and nonfictions, and poems. It is a demanding and rewarding read. Like most of his work, his human subjects here are mainly males- of history, myth, and his own invention. Women are not much included in his oevre. I add that so that readers new to Borges are informed, in advance.<br />He does not court the reader so much as respect readerly intelligence.  As such his work sometimes initially intimidates students - and later, thrills. It stays with you, permanently.<br /> Borges was a master of several forms, and they are here. Most of his areas of interest are 'big'  themes : art, poetry, mortality, loyalty, destiny, ancient and world history.  (He even wrote articles about books or other articles that, in fact, did not exist - other than for his express purposes.)  In his poetry and other pieces, notions of eternity versus mortality  (for example: one's knowing that one will never again open a certain beloved book, travel a familiar street, or know or see a still-living loved one)  is approached with profound humility and grace. There are meditations on a variety of men and topics, among them Shakespeare, 'the Aleph,' and Shih Huang Ti, the Chinese emperor who ordered that the Wall of China be built, and &quot;likewise ordered all books antedating him to be burned.&quot;<br />Borges loves details, material culture, and even minutiae, too. There is much to hang on to in these pieces. It's  a deliberate and purposeful sampling of some of his work - not a &quot;best of,&quot; since one volume of 200 pages can't really do that. His writing demands full engagement. Many of his stories lack characters of romance, drama, or overt emotionality - but have great power nonetheless.<br />Several of his most well-known poems are included. &quot;The Art of Poetry,&quot; as able an explication of the meaning of art, life, and eternity as you might ever read and &quot;The Tango,&quot; a poem about (among other things) Argentina (&quot;The South, behind suspicious walls,/Keeps a knife and a guitar.&quot; In conclusion: &quot;An impossible recollection of having died/ Fighting, on some corner of a suburb.&quot;)<br />Borges is considered to be a modern master, and this collection illustrates why.	2001-02-25

Ardizzone soon came into a small inheritance and, &quot;encouraged by his wife but to the horror of his father,&quot; devoted the rest of his life to the passionate and dedicated work of painting, drawing, illustration, and, to a lesser but no less successful degree, print-making.<br />Ardizzone's work was recognized and valued early on. In his Preface Paul Coldwell writes accurately that Ardizzone &quot;displays that rare talent, along with Tenniel and E.H. Shepard, of representing a vision of what it is to be a child that is as intense as the reality experienced.&quot;  In 1941 Ardizzone was named official War Artist; he sent home incredible drawings from North Africa, Normandy, and Germany. He was the first British soldier to set foot in Denmark. In all, he submitted over 500 drawings, including over 400 watercolors. Some were prints, and are included here. This beautiful 'catalogue raisonne' (salmon pink endpapers, and many color plates)  was published in conjunction with a traveling retrospective exhibition (England only) of Ardizzone's prints. The hundred or so etchings and lithographs have as their subjects lovers, dancers, children, boats, life drawing class, street scenes, public schools, the beach, pubs, prostitutes, wartime, Gloucestershire, Suffolk, plus 'various commissioned posters' (all in great color), menus, and more The images  reflect his overriding optimism and acceptance of human frailty and foibles. He loved to dance, he got along well with people, he loved the world - and it shows.  His images are most often generous and emotionally expressive, often a little humorous or moody, and gentle - without being weak in the least. Ardizzone is a tender and careful tour guide. A &quot;sharp observer of life at all social levels,&quot; he &quot;preferred the fat to the thin,&quot; (White, in the Foreword), was considerate of his subjects, and never objectified the powerless. <br />It's a terrific book, with a Foreword, a Preface, and Introduction, and a comprehensive and informative narrative (by cinematographer and art historian Dr Nicholas Ardizzone, the artist's son).  There are over a hundred good illustrations, some in color, as well as several photographs of the genial and lovable Ardizzone. In addition, the gritty details of the art and craft of printmaking are included - a nice plus.<br />Finally, there is a list of autobiographies (diaries, memoirs) written by Edward Ardizzone, and a  bibliography that Dr Ardizzone compiled as part of the work of his doctoral thesis. You can take that list and read for months, if you choose to. <br />This is a beautiful book. It was compiled and assembled by a team of Ardizzone devotees - a labor of love as well as scholarship.  Aside from being a guide to Edward Ardizzone's prints, it's a terrific value, because along with the images you get insightful and informative commentary, and a sense of the man - that money really can't buy.	2001-02-21

Dr. Mori offers a concrete portrait of the Japan of her childhood and of her withdrawn and grieving adolescence. She provides hundreds of interesting visual, auditory, and emotional details - using a disciplined structure. This is a story that has a chaotic event at its core, and yet there is no chaos in the retelling.<br />In an explanation  of traditional clothing colors in Japan, Dr. Mori explains that girls and  younger woman may wear pastels, bright pinks, and reds, but as a woman ages, browns and blues predominate, giving way to the grays and  dark blues of middle age and beyond. Mori's mother committed suicide at 41, when her only daughter was twelve years old. Dr. Mori: &quot;She never completed her transition into the brown-and-dark-blue middle age.&quot; <br />Dr. Mori does not solicit your tears, but you will want to hold that bereft little girl in your arms.<br />Her father, a largely absent man whom she barely knew, remarried. She became an eagle-eyed observer, but  Japan was a society and a  country that could not hold her, and did not. She left immediately after high school.   She contrasts Japanese culture and customs with the genuinely &quot;nice&quot; midwestern American milieu that she eventually adopted, gladly,  as her home. (There's even a discussion of the ubiquitous Jell-O mold.) It's a very interesting tour, led by a woman who is searching for meaning, intent on learning more, and is a compassionate interpreter. Not a word is wasted in this narrative. <br />The meanings of colors, of emotional states, of visual and auditory symbols, of cities and crowds, fashion, guilt and obligation, of ways of speaking (form and content), as well as food, furniture, creativity, women's roles and even proscribed registers for female speech - are decoded, deconstructed, and analyzed by Dr. Mori. Her tone is quietly thoughtful and compassionate, though deeply critical. Her memories of her life with her mother, and of childhood and adolescence, inform some of her discussions. This ambitious book attempts the work, perhaps, of two books: comparative conversations about Japanese culture,  and a daughter's grief at losing her beautiful mother. In that sense Dr. Mori took a risk with this book. I liked it very much.	2001-02-21

Rabbi Boteach, young (as a kid he attended a friend's Star Wars theme bar mitzvah) rabbi and talk show denizen, argues his thesis with dedication and enthusiasm in ten chapters, but he spoils the mood far too often by joking around, often irrelevantly or quite tastelessly. He has a fondness for slapstick.  It is as if a bright, tender-hearted Hasidic rabbi and your friend's smart-aleck thirteen-year old nephew had collaborated on this book. <br />In one chapter per commandment, he cites specifics (why one shouldn't talk about one's 'ex' - see the second chapter, &quot;Making Your Date Your One and Only&quot;; what the Sabbath and a date ought to have in common; &quot;Sacred Moments and Sacred Time,&quot; fourth chapter). He seems sincere in his wish to help people - single or married -  find lasting married love. It's his delivery that interferes. <br />Rabbi Boteach digresses, careening wildly, sometimes.  He sometimes loses the thread. (Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorena Bobbett, Monica Lewinsky - are all here.) He is often flippant. A paragraph or two of sincere and thoughtful commentary will be zapped, really, by a silly, jokey reference. In an earnest discussion regarding (for example) &quot;How to behave on a date,&quot; he digresses nearly compulsively, inserting a silly story (fictional) -involving cartoonish violence - about a date he once had with his now-wife.  Sometimes it's difficult to know when he's kidding - until you've been 'had.'<br />A disappointment, especially since there is much that is valuable here.	2001-02-21

The posters are reproduced nicely, although in postcard size. To readers with questions about the actual canine work of a race, this book explains quite a lot. Siberian huskies are the stars of &quot;the last great race,&quot; and there are many modern-day improvements to their lot - food-warmers, airlifted straw drops (for their sleeping comfort) and more. The Van Zyles' dogs are varied and gorgeous. Jon Van Zyle is a handsome bearded man who appears - with great success -  in some of the posters. Jona Van Zyle offers a wealth of information.  The drawings are romantic and even heroic - without being kitschy. For example, the piercing blue eyes of a Siberian husky are actually hauntingly beautiful in real life - and a Van Zyle painting might confirms that. A great look at beautiful, hardworking dogs by two people who love them.	2001-02-19

That magazine, which Kincaid points out was &quot;a magazine that has since gone out of business, though there exists now a magazine by that name,&quot; was her home for over ten years.

If you are new to Jamaica Kincaid's mind and writing, they are a great introduction.

Dr. Rosenblum is passionately involved in the art and craft of photography. She has a world view that she puts to great use here. One of the best and most respectful things about this survey, aside from its obvious profusion of well-chosen photographs and the assured and authoritative commentary, is the effectiveness of Dr. Rosenblum's knowing method of assemblage. In the arrangement of these photographs there is ample room for readerly associations, emotions, and thought. The commentary, both in form and content, reinforces this. We are in the hands of a gifted teacher, in fact. Whether it is a series of photos of human hands, folds of clothing, leaves, children's faces, natural forms - the reader is taken on a deeply affecting, associative journey, and the results run deep. This is in addition to this book's obvious workhorse usefulness as a terrific reference work.<br />One hundred pages at the book's end are devoted to notes, careful and thorough biographies of the photographers, a selected bibliography, and an index. The production values are first-rate.  A wonderful book.	2001-02-14

She begins assertively and positively, naming a central problem: the depiction of black &quot;otherness&quot; in historical photographic representation.  She loves photography, a medium that has &quot;given me the opportunity to walk through history.&quot;  She believes in photography - and her understanding of the medium's power and her ability to teach it to maximum effect are at the heart of this successful book. <br />Eighteen contemporary African American artists, writers, poets, professors, and critics contributed essays.  As a jumping-off point, the contributors begin with a photograph of their choosing. There are around fifty photos in this book, one image often leading to another. <br />In some cases, the stories are easier to come by than the photos.  Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor writes, &quot;If family stories were photographs, I'd need a small museum to house them, but a shoebox could house all the photos I have of my family.&quot; Her amazing grandmother gazes forthrightly at the photographer, but it's the remarkable family stories that are left.<br />Big themes challenge the reader. Family histories, objective and subjective views of African American culture, suffering and diaspora are, not surprisingly, woven through many of these essays. Some of the photos are well-known; others, not. Contributors chose family photos, and others present personally experienced public images. Robert A. Hill writes on Marcus Garvey, mentioning that through the 1920s there was a huge and important annual parade in Harlem - in which a contemporary newspaper reported that &quot;fifty thousand Negroes of all ranks and stations in life and from every part of the globe - there were princes, high officials of various governments, [...] were in the line of march.&quot; (p. 190).   Angela Davis regards her own image on 1970 &quot;Wanted&quot; poster. There are daguerreotypes, news photography, and portraiture. In some cases, the absenceof photos - and of visual evidence - is the compelling theme.<br />St. Clair Bourne analyzes African American images in film, including the (cinematic) birth of stereotypes. A gorgeous and confident man exuding &quot;carefree masculine identity,&quot; bell hooks' young father before he became a father, is the introductory image in her absorbing essay. E. Ethelbert Miller's &quot;In My Father's House There Were No Images,&quot; is sad and disturbing. Disarmingly, he writes, &quot;When you are the baby of the family, seldom do you know what is going on around you,&quot; and then proceeds to show that he knew very, very much. His story is compassionate, brilliant and wise. Carla Williams' &quot;The Erotic Image is Naked and Dark,&quot; begins with a French daguerreotype from the 1850's in order to discuss physicality and representations of sexuality. Jacquie Jones writes about a photo of a 1930's lynching that as an eleventh grader she spotted in her (integrated) high school textbook &quot;reproduced carelessly in the tome, added as an afterthought to whatever the text was (...)&quot;   recording for us the awful moment in which she, in fact, understood the 'banality of evil.' The image, she guesses,  was not so unsettling to the white world - and, worse,  that the spectators in the photo were, in all likelihood, still very much alive. Jones' deconstruction of her experiences of &quot;intense, personal racism&quot; is at the heart of her essay. <br />There are contributors' notes at the end, and detailed captions for each photograph. A great and beautiful book.	2001-02-07

I was unfamiliar with this book, now being reissued, and so was surprised (and a little disappointed) at the fact that it has precious few color plates. The zillions of illustrations are for the most part reproductions of contemporary 1920's ads and other published materials - and so are in black and white. There is an enormous amount of good material in this book - furniture, houses, and a lot of decorative and/or functional objects - but the casual reader (someone who is not a confirmed history-of-design maven) would be helped by having seen the artifacts in another venue - whether in museums, private collections, or in color photographs. This is a great resource for readers who are familiar with, and committed to, the subject.	2001-02-06

In what at first seems like a bit of a patchwork they tell a sort of blinding truth, in the tradition of Hasidic folk tales. God is not only a presence, but a character. In a mirror of the human mind, an assortment of worlds - places, times, emotional and mental states - somehow coexist. There are important yet homely recognizable details plucked from bourgeois prewar European life, but no quaintness in the descriptions of the characters' histories in Europe (mainly Germany, Hungary, Austria, Rumania) and then Palestine and Israel.  For example, the protagonist segues quite reasonably from a consideration of an ice cream cone  to the burden of his father's mental illness - in several paragraphs. Love among people (parents and children; men and women) is often a troublesome thing. &quot;Women, Joseph thinks, yearn to embrace a man, and a man yearns to embrace his Creator [...]&quot; <br />Patience is required, and rewarded. The presence of the several languages (German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Arabic and the English of the translation) is the tip of the iceberg, really, in these stories that attempt so much. Definitely worth reading.	2001-02-05

In his Introduction, a thoughtful essay on Yiddish, he asserts that although he born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1934, he grew up in a one hundred percent Yiddish-speaking world (&quot;I didn't know that anybody in this country spoke English until I was old enough to go to the movies.&quot;) His family moved back to New York before he was five.<br />This little book contains a wealth of Masonisms. Jackie Mason used to have run-ins with censors and others. He reserves the right to be both self-deprecating and insulting. Jews, gentiles, politics, marriage, family, ethnicity, money, power, and God himself - all are up for grabs. There are a lot of funny stories. In addition, he has an understanding of the Yiddish language that he is happy to share.  (Harry Truman was haimish - accessible, natural - FDR was not. Colorful explanation is provided.) He offers a theory of chicken soup that links it -successfully - to most of the world's cuisines.  He is never dull. Mason: &quot;It seems that in English that you have to prove that you're not emotional in order to have class.&quot; He posits his sociolinguistic theory (which you've heard if you've seen or heard his stage show) that the more emotional the speech - content and structure - the more &quot;low class&quot; the speaker. He defends emotionality. He loves Yiddish, and in fact the language (black English, specifically) of any people engaged in a battle of wits to survive.<br />A funny and endearing book.	2001-02-04

It deserves all of the praise it has earned. <br />Hamburger is a lifelong Democrat.  He is old enough to remember fascism's disastrous effects on the world, and wise enough to have no patience for its contemporary apologists, although he is good at describing them. He is deeply humane and deeply ethical - along with being a wonderful storyteller. He is very, very smart, and  has a great ability to listen, to watch, and to get to know people. In a quiet and subtle way, he is wholly present. These are some of the abilities that are at the heart of his writing. <br />He has been at it, &quot;warily,&quot; (his adverb)  for a comparatively long time. In his Prologue he offers some interesting autobiographical material. This collection begins with a piece written in 1943, and the most recent is from 1993. He reports on his fourteenth inauguration, and that he had to skip two of FDR's. Students of American politics of the '40's, '50's, and '60's will not be disappointed. &quot;Lonely Day,&quot; a short, atmospheric piece about voting for President in 1960, and &quot;One Man's Vote,&quot; written in 1992, are two of many pieces that in 2001 seem nearly prescient. In the second one there is some suspense regarding election day, a crisis regarding broken voting machines, and, in this instance, a happy ending. The machines are fixed and voting resumes. Democracy prevails. &quot;One man&quot; votes. This event had deep meaning, and the reader knows it.<br />An  April 1970  piece &quot;Hand on Cardozo,&quot; quotes then-Nebraska Senator Roman L. Hruska's public defense - against charges of mediocrity - of Judge Harold Carswell, President Nixon's nominee to the US Supreme Court. Nixon: &quot; Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers, and they are entitled to a little representation, aren't they?&quot; <br />In addition to being smart and colorful political reportage, his pieces also form a series of lessons on how to write. I can't imagine students not learning from him.  Whether it's the grape juice that a public figure happens to be drinking, or the atmosphere of City Hall in NYC Mayor LaGuardia's administration (&quot; ..the Hall seemed electric. Secretaries addressed one another hurriedly, the way spies talk in Hitchcock movies.&quot; ), he can distill and enlarge -  to great effect. Finally, there is a jewel-like piece on seeing the Vermeer show (&quot;I slipped down on the Metroliner&quot;)  at the National Gallery in Washington, in 1996. <br />This is a great collection and thoroughly worthwhile.	2001-02-02
US	51725472	R2UDY1RYGMQUMA	0688176755	550036136	Tim in Danger	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Seaworthy excitement and drama	Edward Ardizzone is skilled at describing children's adventures that are harrowing, exciting, and original. Tim is a nice boy and a loyal friend. He lives a comforting, cozy English daily life in a seacost town - and also has amazing adventures. Modern kids aren't awfully familiar with life at sea, and certainly no one my children knew could set out into the world in order to search for a friend who had left home. Ardizzone's locales and situations manage to seem exotic, yet totally reasonable. We were pulled into this story. The plot is complex enough, the action is convincing and, as usual with Ardizzone, the denouement is pleasing without being Milquetoast. The story can withstand repeated readings, which is a nice plus, since your child might want to hear it repeatedly. In addition the pen and ink drawings, with watercolor wash, are a constant treat for adults and kids.	2001-01-31

You can read this story to a five year old, and both of you will interested - even enthralled. There is a quietude to his illustrations that my children loved.  Pen and ink with watercolor washes, they convey the mood of an English seacoast town, the moods of this story's many characters, and allow room for the viewers' moods and varied reactions to the text. Children don't so much gawk at his drawings as enter them - safely.<br />In this story, despite wearing a life belt, a little girl nearly drowns, and is rescued by the boys Tim and Ginger. They carry her limp body into Tim's house where &quot;Tim's mother put her to bed with lots of hot water bottles and blankets.&quot; No one knows who she might be.  The doctor is called, and her convalescence begins. Her recovery is rocky and it is that process, with plenty of drama,  that forms the rest of the story. <br />Ardizzone's messages are in favor of friendship and sticking out one's neck for others. There are some disturbing but manageable events in the story that parents might want to talk about with children. (Charlotte's amnesia; the absence of her parents; Tim's treatment at school - for writing to Charlotte, later - whom he misses.)<br />Another wonderful children's book by Edward Ardizzone.	2001-01-31

A part-time job at the Boys Club (thanks to the WPA) in the early 'thirties enabled him to meet photographer Lewis Hine, take his photography class, and acquire Hine as teacher, mentor, and friend for life. Rosenblum joined the Photo League in New York, a national locus for photographers and the burgeoning field of photojournalism. According to Shelley Rice's great introductory essay, in several rooms it offered photographers &quot;a place to go, a focus for creative energies, and a chance to become part of a positive and dedicated community.&quot; In addition, the League, largely motivated by photographer and teacher Sid Grossman, &quot;offered Rosenblum an education in the arts that was lacking in his family background and formal education, and the opportunity to write about photographs as well as to make them.&quot; It is this ability to articulate his passions in order to  allow his photography to  reflect and magnify his humanism and unwavering sense of ethics that both distinguishes Walter Rosenblum, and places him squarely among the world's best documentary photographers.<br />Rosenblum joined Life Magazine in the late '30s. After the US joined the war he enlisted in the Army and was assigned to the Army Signal Corps, where he was trained in filmmaking. He was the first photographer to film the liberation of the camp at Dachau, and was highly decorated, receiving  the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and more. Awards aside, Rice asserts that &quot;the motivating force of his life has been his interest in people and his inner need to communicate with them, whether in the classroom or through his camera.&quot; He became a member the faculties of several colleges and art schools, and is Professor Emeritus of Photography at Brooklyn College, among many other honors.<br />This is a  beautiful book of 140  black and white photographs and able, perceptive commentaries that discuss Rosenblum biographically and, later,  in a larger context in &quot;The Camera Image in Social Action,&quot; a careful and lengthy essay by photography historian Naomi Rosenblum.  The series of black and white  photos are of  Pitt Street (1938), War (1944), Spanish Refugees (1946), Gaspe (1949), 105th St. (1952), Hospitals (1962), Haiti (1958-59), Europe (1973), Long Island City (1979), and the South Bronx (1980) They are arresting and emotional. They have historic value, too - as documentary. Street life, families, interiors, lovers, fun and suffering and a lot that lies in between, along with the detritus and disastrous artifacts of war and displacement - are here. The photos have been chosen and arranged sensitively. There is compassion without bathos. Open the book at any page, and the pair of facing photos that you see are complementary in mood and meaning. In addition there are remarks by photographers who worked with Rosenblum.<br />This is a terrific and well thought-out compilation with great accompanying writing and high-quality production. There is a bibliography and a list of Rosenblum's writings. This book is definitely worth the effort it takes to find it.	2001-01-28

Immediately, it becomes much more than that.  Eric Clapton contributed the forward, and author Richard Chapman, an accomplished musician, offers a brief introduction. He has a heartbreaker of a story, told in around fifty words.  As an English teenager living in a village in  Kent in the '60's he loved the guitar, saved his money, and bought one. His parents disapproved. &quot;When I was 14, all my music and instruments were destroyed and burned by my father (...)&quot; You know you are reading a work of passion and love - and great optimism, for he continues, &quot;but this only gave me a greater determination to succeed.&quot;<br />Chapman surveys the guitar's music, history, and many of its most significant players. There is a gorgeous painting of Segovia, and engravings and pages from medieval manuscripts that show guitars or guitar-like instruments.  You read his paragraphs in awe of his ability to tell a lot, briefly. He analyzes the music - pleasingly. You get a little music theory, and I welcomed it. In addition Chapman seems to have a deep store of music-history tidbits. On the roots of slide guitar, we learn that W.C. Handy in around 1903 &quot;passed through a southern railroad station and saw a singer playing slide guitar with a knife, producing what he termed 'the weirdest music I ever saw.' &quot;<br />The book is divided into Classical, Flamenco, Blues, Country, Folk, Jazz, Rock and Pop of the UK and Europe, Rock and Pop of North America, Latin and World. Within those categories are many subcategories. Lots of great photos. The text is orderly and elegant. Influences and origins are given careful attention. There are color and black and white illustrations - historical documents, appropriate snippets of written music, paintings, and archival material.  Famous electric and acoustic guitars - Gibsons, Resonators, Rickenbackers, Stratocasters, Martins, others - are in here. There's an enormous amount of material. The layout and art direction is continuously a pleasure, the captions are consistently informative, and the glossary and index are thorough.<br />Chapman lets you know at the outset that the vastness of the subject necessitated an enormous amount of culling, and then paring down. He loves the guitar, and can teach it, too - and has put that enthusiasm to great use. It's a first-rate documentary that is scholarly, lively, and greatly satisfying.Stratocasters, Martins, others - are in here. There's an enormous amount of material.

Burt, the narrator, is a bright, active child, often anxious, and an able reporter, but he cannot begin to feel for other people. It is not a character flaw; he is ill. On the other hand, Burt is observant and he tells us what he sees. There's a fantastic inventory of the &quot;stuff&quot; of a middle class American 1950's childhood. You can see everything - from the classroom to the table set for Thanksgiving, to the stuffed animals in his room at home. His concerned parents, his cozy home life, a brother, cars, other kids' families, summer camp. He has a photographic memory but it's of little use to him, since the lens is cracked. <br />The normality and conventional comforts of his suburban life are the backdrop for the unfolding of his autism, and for the deliberate, sly tale he tells. On the one hand, Buten reports on the usually manageable events of the downside of an average child's &quot;good&quot; childhood (missing a Halloween party, reluctantly returning to school after vacation, the dentist, mean teachers, bullies, annoyed yet kind parents). You know from the outset that things are going to go very wrong, and you watch the storm gather. <br />A strange and disturbing novel.	2001-01-23

Some of it seems like checkstand reading. In the (successful) effort to supply readers with an avalanche of factoids suitable for chitchat, any scholarship that might have been utilized is, instead, sacrificed. Arguments (the existence, for example of DNA testing to determine paternity) that would contradict some of its silliness is left out.  Pop culture, advertising, rumors, humorous bits, and a mishmash of anecdotal evidence combine and bubble in this stew. It's more of an idea for a board game, really - than a thoughtful study. Instead of citing their references, the authors add a note asserting that their book has been &quot;assidiously researched and documented.&quot; They name their fact-checkers, and the reader is then invited to visit the &quot;Mean Genes&quot; website. A cynical and disappointing read.	2001-01-17

Duchting has chosen illustrations that consistently reinforce his assertions. The commentary is smart, informed, and lively. Even if you dozed in Art History, this book is excellent. Duchting has done his homework, consulting Klee's own (published) diaries, notebooks, and sketchbooks, and  the extensive writings of Klee friend and biographer Will Grohmann, and additional early biographers. In addition Duchting has spent a lot of time looking at the paintings themselves.  Some of Klee's incredible lecture notes (which you must see to believe) from his years of teaching art are included, as are several quick drawings and works of artists who were associated with Klee.<br />This book has terrific production values. The paper is good,and the approximately 100 color reproductions are exquisite. Photographs of Klee, his wife Lily, and his studio. Page layout is a visual treat. It's really a gem of a book, right down to the lemon-yellow endpapers. There is a a short biography, pages of good endnotes, and a 'Selected Bibliography' (page 111).	2001-01-17

As such it suffers from some of the usual maladies of history textbooks.  It seems to have been compiled by committee. One wonders to whom - other than undergraduates with required reading - it is addressed.<br />Big, mind-numbing (because not particularly thought-provoking) statements abound. Often, they stand alone, to be followed by  more big statements. For example, &quot;Popular music gradually surpassed, but did not completely supplant, classical music on urban radio stations. In 1938 the Federal Communications Committee conducted a survey of the content of 62,000 radio hours, and found that one-third of the air time was devoted to commercials.&quot; This statement is offered, not to make a point about the growth of advertising culture but, rather, as an irrelevant topic sentence for an assortment of subsequent statements about radio content. The book is dominated by this hodge-podge effect, and the mind wanders because of it.<br />Precious little - whether social movements, political realities, or cultural phenomena - is given more than a few sentences. Urban culture, the labor movement, sexual mores, Christmas, fashion, funerals, comic books - all seem equally weighted. The authorial tendency toward generalization, although an accepted &quot;register&quot; for textbook writing, is unfortunate for what is omitted. The consequence is that students are uninspired, and aren't taught how to do history. An opportunity is lost.<br />The introduction would seem to promise the inclusion of at least snippets of oral history and remembrance and some primary sources, but none is included, other that what has been predigested by the author. The effect is that the reader is distanced from the material and, unfortunately, from the very interesting history it purports to introduce.<br />In the plus column, there are wonderful photographs and good notes, and an index. Frustrating reading.	2001-01-14

Abagnale's compulsive lying, the felonies it engendered, and the numerous women he met but never really seems to have known begs the question, &quot;How did he get that way?&quot; One would hope that the author would have wondered, too. One might assume that there was some terrible deficit somewhere in his early life. Unfortunately there is no introspection in this story, and no self-awareness, either.<br />An autobiographical portrayal that, finally, allows the reader to think of Austin Powers as a deep, sensitive, and complex man. In addition, it's an unintentional catalogue, whether factual or not, of just how much a reasonably clever, ambitious, well-spoken, well-dressed middle-class white American male, intending to do harm, could get away with - albeit before Interpol. Depressing stuff.	2001-01-12

You can read it a little at a time, or all at once. Edwidge Danticat has done a fantastic editorial job.<br />The contributors are of various cultures and ages. They all write in English, and also live in the U.S. Many are teachers of writing, too. Whether originally from Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, or Africa, each writer has a sensibility of inevitable &quot;otherness,&quot; and a challenging sense of differentness - and, sometimes, of belonging to a mother culture that is ultimately - and often after difficulties - rich and giving. Gay culture, too.<br />Conflict abounds. The stories are not predictable, and the points of view are varied. These pieces each have palpable tension - and satisfying, non-formulaic resolution. Chang-Rae Lee writes of a harrowing set of events in &quot;The Volunteers,&quot; for example. Larry McMurtry's &quot;Death of the Cowboy&quot; is somber and sad personal essay. Lois-Ann Yamanaka's &quot;Ten Thousand in the Round&quot; is strange and arresting. Poets are included, with great success.<br />Contributors' notes provide additional good information. The list of small-press and mainstream publications - where these pieces originally appeared - at the collection's end includes descriptive and subscription information and is sufficient to keep one happily reading for weeks - or throughout the year. A great value and thoroughly worthwhile. I only wish I'd had this book with me the last time I was stuck at an airport for an extra few hours. <br />Deserves more than five Amazon stars.	2001-01-07

Some, but not all, of the world's best photographers - through the early 1960's - are in this book.  This is a comparatively small (8 x 10 and under 150 pages) assemblage of great black and white photos and brief quotations, mostly one and two-liners, relevant to various modes of transporatation. Like the original Life, you look at the fantastic pictures first, and read second.  Whether or not you agree with Daniel Okrent in the Introduction that &quot;photographers like things that move,&quot; these are great, varied pictures. Commuters on the New Haven Railroad, Nov. 22, 1963 (headlines: &quot;President Shot Dead&quot;), German men assembling electric toy trains in 1931, Irving Schild's photo of a bicyclist who is carrying an impossibly tall stack of newspapers in Mexico City, construction workers pouring out of the QE II at the end of the work day (John Loengard, 1968). Drive-ins, airshows, the open road (with the cumulus clouds that Life's editors loved). Many, many more.<br />The feeling is less nostalgic than archival. And this time around, all photographers are identified. Great photos. Transportation buffs and at least several dads and grandfathers I can think of would enjoy this book a lot.	2001-01-07

There is much more than suffering, though, in this story. Gently, simply, and beautifully, his life is described: in Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge and during nearly unimaginable years of famine and deprivation. National history as well as that of his close large family, their culture, religion - including food, festivals, personalities, and a panoply of observations about nature and the animal (and spirit) world. Kravanh's deep attachment to music, specifically (and to this reader, surprisingly) the accordion, is a theme, and a source of sustenance in the years of his suffering. <br />There are countless themes that are reinforced in this story. His parents, especially the personality of his remarkable father are described rivetingly and memorably. <br />Lafreniere, Daran's collaborator in this work, describes their method in a prefatory note. &quot;It is not,&quot; she writes, &quot;a translation, an oral history, or an autobiography.&quot;  Lafreniere goes on to write that it is the result of &quot;the interplay of opposites,&quot; presumably those of herself and Daran.  In my view, this is disconcertingly vague and isn't an adequate discussion of methodology. There was extensive collaboration, (no tape recorder), and the reader deserves a clear description of the method that produced such an amazing account. It's a shortcoming of this otherwise amazing, eye-opening, and soulful story.	2001-01-07

I know that I did. David Hays has a surfeit of academic, personal, and professional accomplishments. In his sixties, he was semi-retired, kids grown, had good health and a happy family life. His mind is unquestioningly fertile (yet organized) and he seems to embrace new experiences. As a child he gazed into a mud bubble, and glimpsed eternity. As an adult he throws himself  into the grass in his back yard, in order to look more closely at the earth.  His life was full, and meaningful, but  he does not brag, and he is likable from the outset. Rather than rest on his not inconsiderable laurels, he decides to become a Bar Mitzvah, joining a class of local eleven and twelve-year olds - in order to devote himself to study with his congregation's rabbi, Doug, for more than a year. It is this journey - and there is a steady unfolding, with no outburst of religiosity -  that forms the starting point for this wonderful narrative. Hays has an ability to tell you a lot about himself by telling you about other people. He respects himself, and he respects others. He is never boring. His parents, in-laws, grown children, grandchildren,  his wide circle of friends and acquaintances, and his classmates are interesting to him, and worthy of reportage. He lets you in on these people and their lives and their histories with unstinting (and never maudlin) respect, even awe. In doing this you find out a lot about Hays and his subjects. Their privacy is never violated, and their dignity is sustained. There is uncloying, laugh-out-loud humor throughout. Family lore emerges, and it is often funny. Hays delights in his wife Leonora's knack of elegantly summing up a situation with a trenchant malapropism. Of his new-found fervor for religious study, she says, &#34;He hooked, line and sinker!&#34; Of the Bahamas: &#34;It's a third-war country.&#34;  He also shares his family history, including a terrific (true) story, &#34;How my family saved Israel.&#34; His feelings and observations as a sensitive member of his class (of the kids at  recess he marvels, &#34;They always know where to go.&#34;)  - and his relationship with his wonderful rabbi - are a pleasure to watch unfold. Hays includes a piece on Anne Frank that is dramatic, thoughtful, and not at all funny. It is appropriately included, given that the concerns of an adult approaching his bar mitzvah are different from those of a child. And at one point, he attends a Harvard reunion - which maybe could have been left out of this book, with no loss of substance to this great story. In all, a wonderful book.	2001-01-02

It deserves all of the praise it has earned.  The chapter &quot;Aids and Advice&quot; contains a helpful subsection, &quot;Advice for Friends and Family Members&quot; that is invaluable. Tips such as &quot;invite us to a quiet place,&quot; &quot;get our attention,&quot; &quot;face the light and face us,&quot; &quot;rephrase,&quot; &quot;create a context,&quot; and &quot;speak slowly&quot; are essential for successful communication with people with hearing loss since, for many people with hearing loss, lip-reading is necessary or at least desirable. <br />Wearers of hearing aids  become particularly vexed by, for example, noisy restuarants. This is because most hearing aids still amplify all sounds without prejudice - the words you want to hear (the signal) along with the crash of dishes three tables away (the noise). Add curtainless windows, uncarpeted floors, background music, and ever-increasing decibel level of voices competing to be heard, and you get a very noisy place. Myers explains this in good detail. He then shares his wonderful fantasy : respite from the &quot;noisy world&quot; of most restaurants and coffee shops via a chain of acoustically thought-out tea rooms and coffeehouses named &quot;A Quiet Place.&quot;  He quotes various studies and surveys that have shown that a great many restaurant patrons object to excessive noise.  <br />Myers offers some great trivia, such as the fact that umpires' hand signals were invented in 1892 by William Hoy, the major leagues' first deaf player. In addition, Myers cites the works and writings of others (whom he names) - Oliver Sacks, linguist William Stokoe, Alexander Graham Bell, for example - leading his reader further into this interesting field, should one wish to read on. He also mentions, though not in much detail, some current research and developments, using lay person's terms. There is an appendix of resources for the hard of hearing, and an index. Nobibliography, unfortunately.<br />A great book and thoroughly worthwhile.	2001-01-01

This 'snow country' is not the same freezing place that your car needs shoveling out of every few days. Rather, it's an exquisite and pristine weekend wilderness where you snowshoe, ski, or - back at the cabin - quietly read or maybe just beat everyone at Scrabble. The fine photos of snowy mountains and inviting cabin windowsills and a few interiors complement the equally beautiful photos of the hearty and appetizing food. <br />The recipes are mostly for the sort of American &quot;bistro&quot; food to which many urbanites might be accustomed. It is essentially humble, but not necessarily quick to prepare. (Someone might like to stay back at the cabin, in order to cook.)  There is &quot;Four Seasons Pizza,&quot; &quot;Three-Onion Soup with Gruyere Croutons,&quot; an omelet and a frittata, various gratins and stews, hearty hot sandwiches, and simple, good-sounding desserts and breakfasts. In addition, there are hot drinks such as Irish coffee, hot buttered rum, glogg, and chai.<br />The ingredients should best be purchased before heading up to snow country. Pearl onions, fresh ginger, turnips, tomatillo salsa, allspice berries, prosciutto, and fontina cheese are some of the things that might be hard to find, once out of town. A few paragraphs on &quot;The Snow Country Pantry&quot; gives the reader advice on this.<br />Nutritional analysis (minus sugars) is provided for each recipe along with a useful note on high-altitude cooking.<br />This is a nice, small collection of seemingly foolproof recipes to satisfy both the winter athletes, unfussy and famished after a day on the slopes, and the folks who've spent the day indoors, enjoying the light, the views, the board games - or the preparation of some incredible meals.	2000-12-27

The biographical portraits of the human rights activists are compelling, and their stories shocking, infuriating, sad, and ultimately inspirational. These are amazing people - prevailing against enormous odds. You read it in awe of the subjects, and their often appalling stories. The black and white photographic portraits are respectful, serious, and appropriate. The one thing I would change about this book is its &quot;coffee-table-book&quot; presentation. It's not an &quot;art&quot; book, there is intensity of feeling and action in its stories, and so is really too important to browse. In my view the big (and expensive) format invites a sort of readerly casualness that is at odds with the subject. There is outsized courage in these stories, but a surfeit of human suffering and cruelty, too.  I wanted to be able to take it with me, and the size of this book makes that impractical. So I hope that it will eventually be published in a more accessible format. Five Amazon stars for excellence in all ways but that one.	2000-12-24

In addition, the section on time-consuming (because you have to keep checking the steam bath) Steamed Puddings - fabulous, moist cake-like English desserts, including Chocolate, Pear, a spiced pudding, and Papaya - is invaluable, and my initial reason for buying the book. One might want to resist baking conventional cakes in the microwave, but cakes are included, and several I tried emerged exactly as promised. Frostings, too. In addition, there are reduction sauces that you can prepare in minutes, and beautiful soups - Caribbean Fish Stew, cream soups, and much more. The ingredients lists are refreshingly straightforward and do not demand obscure ingredients. Kafka has got microwave cooking completely figured out, she is generous with her know-how, she is an innovator, and best of all - offers great food in this very useful book.	2000-12-20

The fabrics and outfits are pretty incredible, and invite you to stare at the goods. The kings look variously dignified, stately, and occasionally mildly hostile to the photographer's gaze. Some seem plainly overdressed, even to themselves. To the author's credit, the reader is told (briefly and somewhat perfunctorily) of the often complicated political, cultural, and kinship machinations that surround a king. In today's African nations these men have little (or no) conventional political power. In some instances, their claim to royalty is viewed, for a variety of reasons,  as wholly illegitimate. The clothing and accoutrements of their position is fascinating to look at, although little information is supplied regarding the meaning of the clothes. Unfortunately there is a stiffness to both the portraits and the commentary, and  that distances the viewer from the diverse and likely very interesting subjects of this book.	2000-12-18

The visual imagery in this collection is terrific, enabling readers' memory, longing, wisdom, regret, sorrow, enormous admiration (of the subjects and all that they represent)- and wonderment. The people and the settings resonate. These are important images. You might well be moved to tears. There is no shortage of emotional appeal to the viewer. One cannot be unaffected by this collection, and all that it represents. <br />In addition, historically important works of art (engravings and paintings) are reproduced - although unfortunately none in color.  The captioning is - for a work of this scope and size, and for illustrations of such power - inconsistent and therefore disappointing, though. <br />Because it's published by an academic press, I expected a more careful and rigorous treatment.  Books of this scope and ambition are few and far between, and one treasures the illustrations - the historic visual record - in and of itself. It's dicey to criticize a collection that has as its focus such a compelling (and neglected) subject: the history of African American women.<br />The subject matter is terrific - but the book is less so. One wishes that the editors had had an editor. (Why, for example, is the &quot;b&quot; of &quot;black&quot; capitalized? To my knowledge this is not conventional usage, and it detracts.)<br />So what happened?  At times the work seems rushed. For example, three people are photographed, two are identified by name, the third called &quot;unknown.&quot; In fact, the writer means &quot;unidentified.&quot;  Accompanying a photo of a shoeless farm worker is the caption telling one, redundantly, that she is barefoot. A number of captions identify the subject as &quot;Unidentified woman, [location, date.]&quot; That seems lifted directly from states' historical societies' archives. One expects more - or less - but not words that merely interfere with one's experience.  One does not need to be told that a photograph is a &quot;photograph.&quot;<br />Occasionally, the editors engage in assumptions regarding the illustrations that, in my view, interfere with the power of the imagery, and reduce the value of this compilation. Guessing as to the subjects' activities in a photograph by Jack Delano, they write that a woman and several children are &quot;possibly waiting for the husband and father to get his hair cut.&quot; In fact, one cannot know, and do not need to know,  what the people were doing that day. The photo is about much more than that. Another incredible photo of a woman and a girl is accompanied by more guesswork as to the relationship of the subjects (mother and daughter?). There is wordiness to many of the captions.  Worst case, there is sometimes unintentional patronization: subjects are identified as &quot;lovely young women,&quot; (p. 81) or &quot;fashionable,&quot; &quot;attractive&quot; (p.4). The end result is a sense that this book was rushed, and that - despite the impressive pool of archival material from which it was assembled - some corners were cut. The editors use interesting and illuminating quotations in places - but meagerly. There is brief index of names of subjects, and names of quoted women, omitting place names and more.<br />I wish that the authors of this work either done more, or less. Mostly, I wish that they had more convincingly respected the ability of these powerful and important illustrations to speak clearly to the reader, and had also trusted readers to make the connections between text and visual imagery that is so satisfying and essential to the meaningful experience of organized archival material.	2000-12-09

If parents read to children, it's nice if a story and its illustrations stay interesting - for at least twenty reads. In addition, it's nice if an author respects a child's ability to be absorbed by an exciting (but not confusing) plot. William Steig and others figured this out. Edward Ardizzone, author and illustrator of this book, has also got it figured out. This book has terrific pen and ink drawings, watercolor-washed, and an unforgettable story. (My kids are grown, yet remember it still.) Tim and Ginger, two boys, are friends who live in an English seacoast town. Without looking for adventure, they find it. A nerve-racking realistically drawn mishap occurs, and is resolved - to the reader's satisfaction.<br />My children loved this series (this is the first book) when they were young. It has a comforting middle-class British sensibility throughout. Children have parents who occasionally require their presence at home or on excursions, bystanders offer help, people meet at tea-time, and if you get wet you warm yourself, later, by the fire. People get frightened, feel sad, and recover and laugh.<br />The story has a neat plot that parents reading to young children will enjoy. It's never cloying. The drawings are wonderful, and contribute perfectly to the mood and the message of the story. People come to one another's aid in fresh and interesting ways. There is no preaching, though, in this neat adventure story for kids - ages five and up.	2000-11-23

Emily Dickinson's reputation was in many ways greatly distorted posthumously by her contemporary Mabel Loomis Todd, late-arriving dragon lady of the Dickinson menage (and eventual mistress of her brother Austin Dickinson, Susan's husband) and originator of &quot;many of the fallacies that have since become Dickinson legend.&quot; (p.204)   Emily Dickinson was capable of deep and durable friendship. She treasured her own company, and also that of a few close friends. She adored her brother's wife, Susan Huntington Dickinson, who lived next-door in Amherst. The feeling was mutual. They were attached to one another, and utterly loyal.  There were no telephones then. Dickinson needed to 'talk' or at least - to write. Some of the letters - mere bits of writing - were on homely topics.  I can guess with certainty that were they alive today, they would have thought nothing of communicating throughout the day via email. So we are all of us in good company.<br />My only mild gripe about this book is the use of the word &quot;intimate&quot; in the subtitle, and the unsubtle choice of the (chaste yet suggestive) photograph by Imogen Cunningham for the cover. This material probably doesn't need to be marketed that way. Dickinson devotees will read this book without the implied promise of sex, and those who don't read Dickinson will be disappointed if they are expecting heated-up correspondence, or in any way sexualized letters from Emily Dickinson to her best friend. These letters are passionate, sometimes playful, and sometimes pedestrian. One reads them for a window on the writer - who was &quot;intimate&quot; with life.<br />A thoroughly worthwhile read.	2000-11-20

This homely book turned out to be the most useful one. It is full of good information, patiently and compassionately conveyed. The entire &quot;Dummies&quot; series is burdened with chaotic graphics (little dartboards, hand icons with strings tied around a finger, checkmarks, a little man) and a schoolbus look for the books' covers. If you like a book to look good on the shelf (always a nice plus) you will have to make a cover for this one. Highly recommended, though, for the neophyte Windows user.	2000-11-18

It is clearly intended for the neophyte, and I bought it when I switched from Mac to Windows 98. Like many new users I was mystified - and frustrated - by various aspects of Windows and looked to the index for help on specifics. Nearly every time, this book failed to address my question. Now that I'm fairly competent this book is useful, but would not recommend for the Mac user new to Windows. The author has not adequately anticipated the most common new-user emergencies, and the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; sections - that you turn to in a bit of a panic - are quite meager.	2000-11-18

Michael King's affection and deep understanding of Janet Frame - and her cooperation with him - inform this work. She is a very private public figure. In this book one gets to know her quite well, with so sense that her privacy has been compromised. One guesses that is due to King's considerable talent for people as well as for biography. <br />King gets the emotional tenor of events just right. He looks into Frame's entire life and work - and focusses on the little things along with the big picture - down to mentioning (for example) that Frame attended one of many dinners in her honor in Wellington, NZ - wearing a formal dress that she had bought for $1.50 from a Salvation Army shop. It's a detail that he could have left out, but that Frame herself would have included. I was grateful for details, for the inclusion of  Frame's considerable and insightful analyses (often only a few words long!) of the works of her writing peers, and liberal use of quotations. This biography manages to be comprehensive, graceful, and not wholly uncritical - although clearly and reasonably charmed by its subject. In addition there are great photographs and notes.<br />Admirers of Janet Frame and of the art and craft of biography will like this book very much.	2000-11-11

Price makes it seem easy. His topics are consistently interesting.  You will never check your watch. Somehow he distills the feel and the details of an event, a remembered feeling, place, or thing, and the results are completely satisfying. He is kind, even courtly toward his reader/listener. You sense that he is good at relationships (family and friendship) - and at telling an utterly fresh and original story. In &quot;Wheelchair Travel,&quot; a very large topic is explored - in around 600 words. &quot;Father and History&quot; covers a father's effect on his son, again, in brief - but deeply.<br />These short essays are great examples of how to write. In addition, there is a refreshing absence of curmudgeonliness, an attitude which (outside of nature writing) seems to dominate the field of short essay-writing, lately.	2000-11-03

Not being a midwesterner I had never heard of Iowa station KMA or its &quot;radio homemakers.&quot; The author informs us early on that the station &quot;relied on talented and creative women&quot; from the outset, in 1925. These Iowa women were radio journalists, home economists, and radio personalities - all in one. There were call-in shows. Their communities depended on them for weekly entertainment, information, humor, and continuity. These women and their shows, which had great longevity, were loved by their listeners, who considered them a part of their lives.<br />This book assembles recipes and life stories with equal ease. The careful stories are of the various women who had shows on the radio, the topics they explored on-air (mostly homey ones of interest to Iowa farm wives), and their effect on their listening community. <br />The photographs are poignant and wonderful. The recipes are mostly high-fat, high-calorie dishes that should probably be eaten in moderation. They are perfect for any one who longs for typical old-fashioned midwestern American food: meat and more meat, potatoes, hearty casseroles, vegetables cooked in old-fashioned ways, cheese balls and dips, cakes, pies, cookies, and candy. Some did not sound like anything one might like to try - &quot;Chipped Dried Beef Deluxe,&quot; &quot;Six-layer Washday Dinner&quot; and (to this reader) improbable party foods such as &quot;Crockpot Chili Dip.&quot; Some are downright disturbing to read, such as &quot;Chipped Beef Chicken,&quot; which combines creamed cheese, chicken, bacon, and beef. Heart attack!<br />The main thing, though, is the size and the goodness of the personalities profiled here, along with the picture of a mostly vanished world. It's really not about replicating the food. A very worthwhile read about a group of interesting and truly nice people.	2000-10-31

The ticket is one-way.<br />But what of Hell today? Camporesi asserts that it has all but disappeared, its once-fetid landscape gentrified, 'improved,' so that really, Hell has ceased to exist. Things have softened - in this life and the Church's hereafter. Think of the most terrible possibilities (genocide, torture, famine) here on earth. As &quot;hellish&quot; as they are, one dies and it is over.<br />What was the purpose of all this? There was a variety of goals. Keeping order was a major one, he asserts. &quot;The Hell which was created by the Jesuits - the dominant model which would later influence the hells of other rival 'religions'- had been primarily conceived as a deterrent for the noble and high-class worlds, and designed to make the loathsome and disgusting smells of the the tomb waft up those large, refined noses.&quot; Camporesi further shows how so many conceptions of hell (and they changed over time, and within the Church) were often quite similar to how the poorest of the poor actually lived. <br />A second section discusses a preventative: the host. This section is less appalling, but relevant and interesting. &quot;The mysterious food&quot; was subject to thievery, intrigue, and large quantities of superstition. Camporesi covers all the angles.<br />This book is appalling and fantastic. Camporesi uses various sources, mostly Italian writiers and historians, and Dante's &quot;Inferno,&quot; of course.<br />Anyone shocked that children are exposed to modern media violence will learn by reading this book that the Churchgot there first - hundreds of years ago. There was no V chip. Kids knew about hell, and it was much scarier than a night of &quot;Cops,&quot; or R-rated films. <br />Definitely worth reading.	2000-10-15

As a teacher - and a famous promoter of poetry, its creation and its creators -  he is fun-loving, but also trustworthy. He knows a lot, he is  humble and giving, and his goal is that you should know a lot, too. He tells the reader, &quot;Certainly you don't have to be embarrassed by not understanding a poem right away.&quot;  He succeeds. I took several weeks to read this book. You can't rush through it - it's too rich for that. Half is Koch's tour of poetry. His approach is bracing, stimulating, and calming in turn. It's a course, really, in Koch's approach, which is utterly straightforward, while retaining plenty of respect for language's possibilities for delight, mystery, enchantment, and love.<br />Kenneth Koch admits on page 281 that he does not always understand W.H. Auden. I appreciated that. This book is especially useful for teachers of poetry. The &quot;Anthology of Poems&quot; that comprises the second half of this wonderful book are each followed by wise, interesting, and fresh commentary by Koch. Definitely worth reading.	2000-10-12

J.D. Salinger is  exposed in this book, not unkindly or recklessly, but exposed nonetheless.  Dad will not be pleased if he reads it. (And most likely, he won't. You  know why - after reading this book.)<br />Peggy Salinger is an able academic,  a smart and thoughtful person, and a perceptive daughter. In addition, she  wants to better the world, and has spent many years attempting to overcome  a sort of misanthropy (disguised as intellectual snobbism, perhaps) that  her dad willed her. She knows her father's published works by heart, and  then some. <br />She has a sharp memory for detail and language,remembers an  astounding number of childhood events, sounds, and smells -  and puts that  recall to good use in this book. <br />In addition, she takes the high ground  through-out. She tries so dilgently to understand her father, for he did  love her - and to interpret him to the world. At the same time, she is  compassionately fair to each and every beautiful and bright young woman to  whom her father, one by one, attached. The results were uniformly  destructive to these women - Peggy included.  In fact, one of the most  interesting chapters deals with the topic of cults, and cultic  indoctrination. Her dad, she asserts, knew how to do it - intuitively.  <br />Peggy Salinger obviously spent many years emotionally processing the  effect on her of her highly unusual parents, specifically her father - and  the truly weird upbringing she experienced. How difficult it would be to be  adored and destroyed - in turn, and never with any predictability.  To her  immense credit her portrayal of her famous father is multi-faceted and  intensely analytical, thoughtful, and even respectful. <br />In addition, she  has interviewed cooperative family members at length, and so this work is  not quite a memoir - at least not wholly her momoir -  but almost ahistory. Her reclusive father is, in fact, the only member of the family  who refused to talk about J.D. Salinger.<br />The facts of her case are at  times appalling, charming, and just plain strange. For example, the  author's parents eschewed the religions of their families and had a yogi,  Lahiri Mahasaya. pictured in the book, who looked to the little girl (and  to this reader) uncannily like Peggy's paternal grandfather, also pictured.  The resemblance is striking, and like much in this book that is not  necessarily wholly germane, it's another interesting thing.<br />I liked this  book very much. It leaves many questions unanswered, but - with Salinger's  writings as primary and secondary source material - tells a lot, too.  Definitely worth reading.	2000-09-11

This one disappointed me. At  its heart is the notion that there are easily-codified, distinct 'types' of  bad-news men, and that with the proper preparation, a woman can recognize  them in order to steer clear! It all makes sense, but it's awfully  simplistic, and therefore not terribly enlightening in the long run. <br />If  a companion volume were written for men about &quot;loser&quot; women, I  believe that we women (who, let's face it, are the primary readers of most  of these books, whether they are directed at males or females) would be  enraged - and rightfully so. The authors take discrete negative traits and  enlarge and universalize them so that they become the defining aspects of  personality. Much is ignored in this process.<br />I do not think that this  book is more than a fun read. I think that often, people we love may have a  number of annoying traits, but many others which can balance the negatives  quite well. And it's in that balancing that couples often find their good  relationship.<br />I gave this book only 3 atars, because it's just too  simplistic.	2000-09-09

They come at it in an energetic and engaging way.  The result is a source book that is a visual treat, and a great home tour.  The rooms - living, bed, kitchens (in which W. African design elements are  adapted to ceramic tiles, with gorgeous results) and more - are lively,  smart, and modern. <br />You notice in reading the text, and drooling over the  abundant photos of the beautiful and stimulating rooms, that well-known  European textile designers of the sixties (the Finnish company Marimekko,  for example) owe a debt of gratitude to indigeneous  African cloth  designers. This is something I hadn't ever realized. <br />A lovely,  inspirational, and worthwhile book.	2000-09-09

It is not an &quot;epic,&quot;  and it was not written with the film  rights in mind. You don't hear the soundtrack somewhere in the back of your  head, nor do you get to &quot;identify with&quot; or &quot;love&quot; the  characters. One of its central characters is rather shy, timid, and  nonverbal. Ha Jin does not tell the reader how to feel - or what to think.  There is no sly authorly manipulation of our emotions. Ha Jin tells an  important and essentially sad story which he narrates with control and  purpose. <br />John Lennon said that &quot;Life is what happens to you while  you're busy making other plans,&quot; and this novel makes that point,  among others. The story unfolds during a specific time (1960's) and place   (People's Republic of China). A group of people is caught in lives over  which they have varying degrees of control. Ha Jin fleshes out his  characters - but just enough. This story is written concisely and  economically.<br />This is a quiet, strong, meaningful, and heartfelt novel.  Its quietude and lack of melodrama - its remarkable menus are often the  most colorful aspects of its characters daily lives - serve its humane and  important message. Definitely worth reading.	2000-09-06

Books	5	11	14	N	N	Rational, sensible, and useful information and advice	Between the screaming chartreuse and hot pink covers of this book are several hundred pages of utterly calm and good advice on love  relationships. The title is misleading, but it does take advantage of the  success of Cox's first book, &quot;Hot Sex.&quot; In fact, a more apt title  would be &quot;Rational Relationships&quot; - not very catchy.<br />Cox is  respectful of both sides of every story, and her advice is  middle-of-the-road, and very reasonable. She takes partnership seriously,  but includes a wonderful chapter on what's great about being on one's own,  too.<br />For adults, much of what she promotes and explains has perhaps been  seen elsewhere - in my case, in the many advice columns, magazine articles,  and self-help books that have come my way over the years. <br />But for  teenagers and young adults, I would recommend this book without  reservation. In fact it's a book that a really good high school  &quot;Health&quot; class might include as recommended reading. All kids  would benefit from its wisdom.	2000-08-31

He has a job in addition to  being a full-time student. Also, he has some inattention problems which he  deals with (successfully, with medication.)   He has been on Sears' program  for one week - substituting soy protein products successfully for his  animal-based menu ingedients - and reports that he has never felt better -  ever. No lags in energy, no sleepy afternoons, and feels mentally more  acute - throughout the day. Sears' theories about insulin and  carbohydrates' deleterious effects on blood sugar make sense to him, since  he says he's felt those effects for years - unpleasantly. So this book is a  huge success for him, and I plan to begin its seemingly simple and sensible  way of eating - today!	2000-08-30

They are of famous people, mostly American,  caught in wonderfully human moments by Davidson over many years. The  Supremes have a snowball fight in Detroit in 1965; a pensive (or exhausted)  Sammy Davis Jr., shirtless, a microphone strapped to his chest - in his  dressing room; Antonioni filming, on a bus in LA in 1968; Marilyn Monroe  getting made up on a set; Paul Newman (fishing) and Joanne Woodward with  their dog on the water's edge in Connecticut in 1965. Linus Pauling at  Stanford, seated at a desk, papers piled high, with a fabulous, chaotic  chalkboard in view. Lots more, too, and not all of them are glamorous  &quot;celebrities,&quot; some are well-known Americans such as Fannie Lou  Hamer, poet Sharon Olds, James Meredith - at work, in bed, on the street.  Great photos, some almost candids, that are expressive and informative - of  the era as well as the subjects.<br />While great to browse through, this  compilation seems a little rushed. There is no table of contents, and no  index. Some of the subjects are puzzlingly unidentified by name;  &quot;Henry Fonda's wife,&quot; for example. Davidson supplies memories and  anecdotes about fewer than half of his subjects.	2000-08-27

It's different from a lot of the other dog books out now, in that  it's every bit as much about dog-lovers as dogs. The pictures are great. In  one, a little Chihuahua peeks out of a macho guy's shirt front. You can't  not love them both. There is humor and dignity and love in these photos. I  salute the authors. In addition it's a compliment to the American South,  for there are folks of all ages, colors, and economic strata co-existing  between this book's covers. A great little book.	2000-08-20

In addition, it's a terrific  teacher of portrait photography. I know that I have tried for years to take  pictures of loved ones that could show even half of what I was feeling  toward my subjects. <br />So how does he do it?  Smith's portraits of  beautiful dads and their delicious babies succeed magnificently for a  variety of reasons. He uses light and shadow to make a point: for balance  and harmony. If a dad's face is partially obscured in darkness, the beaning  grim on his baby's face assures the viewer of the dad's (unseen-by-us) big  smile.<br />Where a muscled fatherly arm is in view, there is the pudgy  softness of the baby's arm. One feels the strength of dad, the  vulnerability of baby, and is thrilled with the photo. Torsos, either trim  or pudgy, are nearly always balanced and complemented by one another. A dad  holds a baby in one hand, and the solidity of the dad's legs - and the calm  face of the baby - assure us that the child is safe.<br />Another thing I  loved about this book is that it reveals mature bodies - not for their  conventional &quot;perfectness,&quot;  but as vessels of love and (in the  dads' cases) protection. It's about bodies, but is never voyeuristic.   <br />But it is the faces which are so arresting. Study this book, not only  for its message of love, hope, and caring - but for the great advice it  offers on how to begin to take much better, if not downright successful,  pictures!	2000-08-20

It's &quot;Volume Two&quot; of a  trilogy, but does not have to read along with the companion volumes. Like  his other two works on childhood, this interesting work, again, introduces  his ideas and promotes a compassionate understanding of the lives of  children.<br />Separation anxiety, anxious attachment, and other phenomena of  attachment are well-known and accepted reactions now - we expect it from  our pets as well as our babies - but at one time, were less well understood  (and anticipated.) This work, lucidly and compassionately, lays it out for  the reader. The book is divided into three sections, and in a  well-organized and deeply accessible fashion, Bowlby proceeds. The Sections  are  &quot;Security, Anxiety, and Distress,&quot; &quot;An Ethological  Approach to Human Fear,&quot; and finally, &quot;Individual Differences in  Susceptibility to Fear: Anxious Attachment&quot;.<br />Bowlby uses his own  prior clinical work and that of others to support his assertions. The  father's role, the role of anger and fear, and many other factors are  discussed. This is a scholarly study, and has much to tell readers. It's  thoroughly readable and interesting, not only for its subject but because  Bowlby can tell a story and hold the reader's interest through-out. Not a  &quot;how-to&quot; or a quick fix - rather, a deeply sensible and basic  study. Highly recommended for parents, teachers, clinicians.	2000-08-20

Wood.: The Compulsion to Build	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Much more than housebuilding	This book is every bit as good as all the praise on its back cover, and its additional reviews promise. Thomas Glynn is a clear-headed,  self-deprecating, and slyly reverent wise man. Often in this book he seems  nearly egoless. It's part of how good and smart he is, and how well he  tells his story.<br />This is a seemingly simple but actually multi-layered  book, on its surface about the building of a small house that Glynn and his  wife planned on &quot;cheap land,&quot; that they bought. The land   appealed to him despite the fact that he knew &quot;I didn't really want to  live on a farm, I wanted to live on the idea of a farm.&quot; And he really  does build a house, and on a tight budget. He hires helpers, and is part of  a little team. &quot;Years ago I realized I wasn't much good at making  money. I don't know why it took me so long to realize this.&quot; But he  knows what it is that he loves, and one of those things is the work of  carpentry.<br />Glynn's book is divided into neat, short chapters.  Some are  almost meditative. He thinks deeply about a lot of things.  He writes about  himself, and several people and places who in the course of this project  become important to him. There's a lot about wood, tools, and building, and  somehow it is all very interesting, whether or not you liked Woodshop  class. <br />You learn about as much about the characters as you might know  had you lived around there for twenty or thirty years. One of Glynn's  incredible abilities is that he never tells too much about a person. It  works well in this book. Whittled-to-the-bone declarative sentences reveal  deep inner lives, complex and layered thinking, real emotion. It's a guide  to run-down things, to parts of the northeast US that don't show up in the  guidebooks, to persistence, to the value of things that might not have a  price tag, or might be had for free if one knows where to look or how to  ask - and a meditation, really, on nature, work, creativity, human (and  canine, come to think of it) oddness and will. Glynn would seem to be a man  who without any self-consciousness is, in fact, in tune with his  surroundings and his fellow man - and can teach us a lot about love and  acceptance. <br />A great read, I have bought copies to give away, and you  definitely do not need an interest in carpentry to enjoy it.	2000-08-13

This new edition is even  better. The pieces, personal and trenchant, ingeniously selected by  Sternburg over twenty years ago, have withstood the test of time. <br />There  is deep feeling, variety, astonishing articulation of complex things, and  warmth and humor in these essays. Many of  the writers fight to write, and  show us their battle plans. It's inspiring and encouraging, and sometimes  it's sad.  Some - I am thinking of young writer Michele Murray, who  struggled against terrible odds - are heartbreaking. Anne Tyler's darkly  humorous recitation of her typical working day, &quot;Still Just  Writing,&quot; is a classic. Alice Walker's essay, &quot;One Child of One's  Own&quot; speaks to motherhood, and its fragile but undeniable relationship  to a writing life.<br />The new Preface, by Dominican-born Vermonter Julia  Alvarez, is touching and insightful and very personal - in keeping with the  rest of the book - and speaks to the concerns of the essays. Sternberg has  also edited her orignal Introduction, and updated the contributors' notes  at the book's end. <br />Without question I'd recommend this wonderful book to  anyone interested in reading women on the process of writing, the art of  memoir, and the considered and considerably interesting opinions of a group  of very wonderful writers.	2000-08-12

Kenton Nelson	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Paintings that talk to you - intelligently and well	These paintings are not so much a 'perfect world' as a figurative and  simple-to-understand world that is saturated in light and color. If you  grew up somewhere else and then visited California, the light quality may  have astonished you. It did, me. Nelson gets the shockingly bright  California light just right. It's mostly the suburbs of southern  California. Nelson loves the '20's houses and their lush yards - bulbous  shrubs and all. In addition, he has painted people and urban scenery -  reminiscent of and deliberately and humorously imitative of Edward Hopper.  But Nelson's scenes have a happiness about them -a little garish at times,  and ironical perhaps, but cheerful nonetheless. <br />Nelson uses color to a  variety of ends. A palette of moody greys and browns is used for  &quot;East, Coast 1990&quot; (there is a comma between East and Coast - in  the book)  and again for &quot;Years of Discretion, 1997,&quot; also the  east coast. You get his point: a Californian in New York notices the greys,  the browns, and would appear to feel the somberness of things. In fact,  &quot;Years of Discretion&quot; begs the question - What, exactly, was  going on that was represented by that bridge? You sense some sadness  there.<br />Nelson's paintings wink genially at Rene Magritte, David Hockney,  and many others. Nursery rhymes, too. (A grown-up Jack and Jill climb a  hill, in one painting.) Their titles are often funny - but never cute.  These are literate and extroverted paintings, and deserve to be seen by a  wide audience.	2000-08-12

In  fairness, I am not a physician, so might not be qualified to really judge  the science in this work. Posner's &quot;me&quot; parts were fine, too. Her  blissful marriage is positioned at center stage, regardless of its  relevance to menopause.  She is passionate about her husband AND her topic.  <br />By midpoint, her cloying and repetitive praise of her husband, Gerald -  (&quot;dear,&quot; &quot;wonderful,&quot; &quot;eternal partner&quot;)  becomes an unseemly bit of bragging that I, a cranky perimenopausal woman,  was in no mood for! Not all of us are lucky enough to live in Heaven with  an angel like Gerald Posner.<br />I wish that the editing process had helped  to tone down the author's excessive praise of her mate - or saved it for  another book, maybe a book on how to meet the Geralds of the world. I'd buy  it!	2000-08-08

In order to do this  work with integrity we need to seek actively to create a safe space for our  interviewees as well as for ourselves.&quot;   Evidently she succeeds. The  interviews - oral histories, really - are presented and interpreted with  care and subtlety by Dr. Davidman. The stories are heartbreaking, each  subject has suffered a grievous loss; but this book is never maudlin. In  addition, its lessons are useful not just for readers who have lost  mothers, but for anyone interested in the why and hows of human caring,  hope, and love. <br />I was deeply affected  and inspired to action as a  result of experiencing this book. I will say that in my view,  &quot;Motherloss&quot; helps to heal the world - not a small thing for  academic research and hard work to accomplish.	2000-08-07

He has a utopian vision, but he is in  command of the facts.  He cites sources, references, and examples from  literally all walks of life - pop culture to world history to cultural  studies to genomics. It's an incredible ride.<br />The book is divided into  three sections, and the chapters are each able to stand alone as insightful  and original essays.  In his first section, the foundation is laid with an  essay on modernity, which traces the beginnings of 'race thinking' to the  eighteenth century in Europe. <br />The second section deals with the  frightening realities of modern fascism, and its considerable threat to  society. Tangentially but not unimportantly, Dr. Gilroy includes a  discussion of power, war, and the language, imagery, and culture of  fascism, including advertising and promotions of mass movements.<br />In the  third section, &quot;Black to the Future,&quot; the author addresses a  panoply of issues including sexism, race and guilt, success, the world of  Black culture, and the considerable implications of cosmopolitanism - a  unified world - as opposed to separateness.<br />No brief review can  adequately discuss this important and erudite author's contribution. The  book is dense, well-organized, and easily could form the text for a  college-level course on this interesting and riveting topic. It is also  totally readable and useful - out of the classroom.  There are nearly 100  pages of notes, and a comprehensive index. <br />A must-read for anyone with  an interest in the multitude of topics he explores - or anyone looking for  a set of good reasons to work to better the world. It has a wealth of  information - and deserves more than five stars.	2000-08-07

Carol Adams believes that it can, and in this  beautifully crafted work she lays out the entire argument. She does not  minimize her personal revulsion toward the eating of meat, and the meat  industry, but she ventures widely - from there. <br />This serious,  disturbing, and well-researched book covers many interrelated topics, among  them women, linguistics, animal rights, violence and terror, political  resistance and patriarchy.<br />Food's meaning and importance to sustenance,  spirituality, ritual and symbol and more - is undisputed. Adams'  interesting, accessible, and scholarly polemic builds a solid foundation  for her fervent wish that feminists embrace vegetarianism, or more  accurately, veganism - the rejection of all animal-based foodstuffs. <br />But  Hitler was a vegetarian and an animal lover; and until I got to Adams'  deconstruction of that seemingly hideous contradiction, I thought,  &quot;There goes the notion of the moral weight of eating habits!&quot; But  Adams tackles the topic of Hitler's vegetarianism (for example)efficiently  and convincingly, and in doing so removes him from the discussion.<br />This  is a serious, disturbing, and well-researched book. Adams sounds a rational  and convincing call for all people with control over what they may choose  to consume - to live and eat deliberately and mindfully. Definitely worth  reading.	2000-08-06

All the passion  &quot;we&quot; brought to sex and love, now &quot;we&quot; bring to the  desire for the right house. It's a glib and silly assertion, made all the  more so by the annoying &quot;We.&quot; Speak for yourself! I kept wanting  to shriek.<br />Dr. Garber is an able writer, her eyes and ears are peeled for  symbols and signs, and she can discuss her various themes wonderfully  coherently, even elegantly. But she is not making sense when she attempts  to pathologize (for example) communities' attempts to standardize exterior  paint colors. For heaven's sakes, it's been done in Scandinavian and  European countries (now democracies) for generations, with no measurable  loss of the citizenry's psychic well-being.<br />She indulges in  generalization which grate. Dr. Garber asserts that today's  glossy,over-the-top shelter magazines such as Architectural Digest are  today's pornography. She lists wording that anthropomorphizes real estate,  as supporting evidence.  This high-minded thought is evidently unknown to  pornographers, who would appear to be doing a good business despite their  continuing exclusion of real estate from their products. Again, one wishes  that she could have personalized her assertions.<br />I think that a more  honest subtitle for this book would have &quot;Why I Love Houses.&quot;  Were Dr. Garber to have simply written of her own passionate flights of  fancy and considerable obsessions and attachments, rather than attempting  to universalize them, I think she would have had a better treatise.	2000-08-04

She is well-organized and  clear, but at times this book's lack of deeper discussions on the subject  seemed like a deficit.

British pediatrician, humanitarian, and  ground-breaking psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott died in 1971, having made a  nearly immeasurable contribution to the fields of psychoanalysis and child  psychology. In this volume, as with his other writings, his ideas are deep,  reverential and respectful, and often somewhat complex, and at the same  time, his presentation is utterly simple and straightforward. The reader is  fully engaged, as a result of Winnicott's incredible knack for connecting  with his audience.<br />The lively and interesting papers comprising this  utterly accessible collection were written over a wide span of time - three  decades or more. The selections are varied, and have been separated for  readerly convenience into several sections: &quot;Health and Illness,&quot;  &quot;The Family,&quot; and, finally, &quot;Reflections on Society.&quot;  Some were written in order to be presented at meetings of the medical  and/or psychoanalytic community; others, to various civic, political, and  other groups (The Progressive League, The Liberal Magazine, The Borstal  Assistant Governors' Conference, etc.)<br />The collection is various and  interesting for its content but also for - not in spite of - its grab-bag  feel. Winnicott was comfortable with his listeners, and never afraid to  speak simply, clearly, and with his trademark empathy intact. In fact, that  empathy was at the core of his work. There's a great variety in it, too.  &quot;The Price of Disregarding Psychoanalytic Research,&quot; a talk given  in 1965, details the importance of his philosophy. (&quot;The link between  poetic truth and scientific truth is surely in the person, in you and  me.&quot;) Essays such as the 1963 &quot;The Value of Depression&quot;  (&quot;Always, depression implies ego strength...&quot;) and the 1967  &quot;Delinquency as a Sign of Hope&quot; (&quot;the antisocial tendency is  linked inherently with deprivation&quot; ) show Winnicott at his very best.  And the playful and kind 1969 &quot;The Pill and the Moon&quot; - written  for an address to the Progressive League in the 1960's - is  wonderful.<br />Some of these hopeful and kindhearted essays show their age,  but in a welcome and lovely way, and therefore each is well worth reading  and thinking about.	2000-08-03

He is also a little bit scary, for  food to him - like sex, drugs, and cigarettes (mentioned throughout the  book, often) is a consumable, at its best thrilling, but also devoid of  real meaning.  These forceful essays are meaty exposes of the restaurant  business, and probably should not be read for &quot;inspiration&quot; or  enlightenment, or even particularly creative ways to think about people or  food. He's a hedonist, and free with his dislikes (vegetarians, for  example), but - in contrast to other famous 'writing' chefs - Julia Child,  James Beard, Alice Waters come to mind - he does not love people or the  possibilities of food nearly as much as he loves excitement and power. I  was disturbed by his mercenary approach to his business, and some of the  scenes he described are downright sickening - and included purely to shock.	2000-08-03

Though  this novel has been called &quot;sexy,&quot; there is very little sex in it  - and, more importantly, very little real desire. There is, instead, a  complex but essentially nonsensical plot, an improbable generations-old  feud between two families, uneducated references to both Italian and Jewish  ethnicity,  and numerous frustrations and plot twists that the would-be  lovers must endure. (Their adult children and grandchildren would appear to  run their lives - distressingly, to this middle-aged reader).  Roy makes  numerous comical references to underwear, aging, and manners. Roy is a  smart observer, and a glib reporter, but unfortunately she confines her  considerable abilities to jokey references and a plot that is not  believable, nor interesting. I was really disappointed in this novel, which  with a little help from an able editor, might have been something more than  a cute, silly story.	2000-08-02

Each concerns the experiences and observations of bereft narrator/subject Alex Fader, a thoughtful, materially privileged but heartbroken (New York) city  boy, only child of intellectuals,  and then Alex as a young man. In fact,  Alex is rather innocently appealing - until, in a story which totally  undermined my faith in him,  he molests his elderly aunt's  housekeeper.<br />In precise, smart, but disassociative prose, Beller's  deadpan narrator leads the reader on a sad boy's tour of 1970's  Manhattan  for the moderately privileged - and then London. Prep school, Manhattan  upper-class landmarks (apartment buildings, neighborhoods, clubs, bakeries,  and more) and diversions figure heavily in the stories. The boy's  psychoanalyst father, benign, &quot;handsome,&quot; but barely-known by his  son, has died of cancer - quickly. Alex embarks on a series of quiet  adventures in order to grieve for that painfully absent father. There is no  solace. His mother, a subtle and appealing stranger,  dotes on him, and he  loves her.  <br />There are several puzzling small details which a  fact-checker might have spotted: a misunderstanding of the symptoms of  Alzheimer's,  a convenient but utterly undeveloped (and therefore, not  believable) link to the Holocaust,  an Austrian grandma liking to make  gnocchi, and Yiddishisms that the boy - who ought to know better - calls  &quot;German.&quot;  The reader is shown much too little, and it's a  shortcoming of these interesting stories.<br />In some ways this book is a  sort of psychic companion to Anne Roiphe's  &quot;1185 Park Avenue.&quot;  Both detail the essential emptiness of a certain sort of 'good life,' and  are sad and telling for having done so. Definitely worth reading.	2000-07-30

It's a metaphor for flexibility and psychic and intellectual playfulness. In his Preface, the author asserts,  &quot;Flirtation keeps things in play, and by doing so lets us get to know  them in different ways.&quot; Phillips, a British child analyst and  respected literary critic,  has assembled a series of readable, erudite,  and sometimes thrilling essays on his customary favorite topics. They are  fresh and insightful - as usual from him. He is interested in literature,  contemporary and traditional psychoanalytic theory, attachment, depression,  the uses and wonders of language, Lacanian musings and  principles, and  much more. The bibliography itself could form the backbone of a lengthy  course of study. The collection is divided into several parts: &quot;The  Uses of the Past,&quot; &quot;Psychoanalysis Revisited,&quot; and  &quot;Writing Outside,&quot; which includes literary essays on Philip Roth,  Isaac Rosenberg, nineteenth century writer John Clare, and Hapsburg  Empire-era Austrian Karl Kraus. But it his the essays on, or  &quot;flirting&quot; with, a wide variety of  psychoanalytic themes which  are at the heart of this interesting, intelligent, and useful collection.  &quot;Freud and the Uses of Forgetting,&quot; &quot;On Love,&quot; and  &quot;The Telling of Selves&quot; reveal Phillips' ability to range widely  - yet with focus, inherent compassion and kindness, and clarity - in the  telling of his themes.<br />An essay on depression, in which he talks with  great respect about the work of Lacanian analyst Julie Kristeva, is  particularly interesting. Erich Fromm, Freud and his biographer, Jones, are  also subjects of essays. <br />This is a terrific book, full of  humane and  productive thinking, and ought to be read and reread by anyone with an  interest in the uses of psychoanalysis, and the very modern, creative, and  original mind of Adam Phillips. Highlyrecommended.	2000-07-06

He was Freud's analysand and, relatively quickly, moved into intellectually uncharted psychological waters. He  gained a reputation as a passionate, unorthodox, and even flakey analyst.  This &quot;clinical diary&quot; charts with candor, disarming simplicity,  and stunning lucidity the thought process of Ferenczi as he discusses his  patients, Freud, his own interesting experiences of countertransference,  and his highly original and ( especially for their time) unconventional  notions regarding the psychoanalyst's rightful and appropriate levels and  types of engagement with patients. He was a caring and humane doctor. The  writing is complex and layered at times.  A very, very worthwhile read.	2000-07-05

It's cluttered with old photographs, furniture, clothing, European and American place-names, German and German Jewish surnames, holidays, defunct European  institutions, sewing supplies, music, the names of plants, and more. All of  this detritus is deceptive and fascinating and essential to the stories of  the lives lived, and now gone. <br />Similarly, but for different reasons, EL  Doctorow's &quot;Ragtime&quot; did this, too.<br />Allusions to Nabokov,  butterflies, and Nabokov's amusement at American place-names shadow some of  the action, and I did not fully understand why - other than perhaps as a  sort of symbol of longing-for-place.<br />One is gripped by all of these goods  and stories: their once-upon-a-time existence, their owners, their  disappearance, and - miraculously - their return. The material culture of  the early twentieth century is used, fabulously and unapologetically, in  order to summon memory, show God in the details, and to illustrate loss.  There is no nostalgia here.<br />An amazing and successful effort by a German  born in 1944 to come to terms with the unthinkable: Germany's attempt to  destroy European Jewry, and Europe, really, too. A wholly original and  efficiently disturbing novel.	2000-06-30

Many wonderful ethnic American  cuisines are represented. In addition, we might long for recipes that are  simple to shop for and prepare. Most of the recipes call for no more than  six or eight  ingredients, all available at the supermarket. (Grandma would  not ever have gone to three stores to bake one cake, remember). That's one  of the best things about this book. There are no hard-to-find ingredients,  or complicated, 'foodie' techniques required. There are tables of  equivalents (US, British, and metric) and a good index. In addition, many  different culinary &quot;grandmothers&quot; contributed, so I'd guess that  just about anyone would find recipes that jog the memory - and appeal  thoroughly. The sweets, &quot;treats,&quot; and desserts are some of the  best I've yet found in one book.  A great collection and well worth its  'remainder table' price.	2000-06-23

They are profoundly cynical, not terribly intelligent, and seem to be as emotionally affected by a J. Crew catalog as by the death of a friend. Women love them and go to bed with them, and those women are unimportant, annoying. Klam has a knack for describing a female's body so that not just her privacy, but her very humanity is threatened. In &quot;Issues I Dealt with in Therapy,&quot; the money- and status-obsessed narrator catalogues the physical flaws of his lover, a medical resident, who has a single hair on her chin, which distracts him. In &quot;The Royal Palms&quot; there is perfunctory sex, after which the grateful woman tells the disinterested narrator that he is the world's greatest lover. The men couldn't care less.

The story is simple: a middleaged novelist and his  wife are visited by an old friend who has become a successful writer of  screenplays. Together they decide that an annoying and aggressive  journalist should get her comeuppance. Not deep or passionate, and not  particularly witty, either. A disappointing story from a usually first-rate  writer.	2000-06-13

Something worth pointing out about Kim's story is that her adoption by essentially cruel and inhumane (and for the most  part, lacking even the rudiments of what today would be called  &quot;parenting skills&quot;) ultra-religious evangelical Christian   parents was in fact a huge contributor to the immense pain she endured,  post-adoption. Not only was she prohibited her past, she was prohibited any  discomfiting (to her parents) emotional expression. She had to learn not to  cry; unhappiness was an affront to a god who had died so that Kim might be  happy! The religious education she received was thorough, and damaging. Of  course she rejected it as an adult, though remarkably, maintains a  respectful and forgiving relationship with her adoptive parents.  Amazing  in all ways.	2000-06-03

His tone is calmly instructive. Most of the gardens shown are  relatively small (and manageable!) He explains and defines the basics of  gardening: a terms glossary, tools, design basics and possibilities,  properties of plants, renovating old gardens, growing vegetables,  troubleshooting, the how-to's of cuttings, and many more topics. Edwards is  a British gardening writer, and his gardening slant is British, too,  although the book has been carefully edited for US hardiness zones and  climates. (Most of the gardens shown require some shade.) He discusses  various methods of weed and insect suppression, both toxic and nontoxic to  the environment.<br />This is not &quot;low-maintenance&quot; gardening,  although the deliberate wildness of some of the gardens might suggest that  - to the &quot;virgin&quot; eye. Not so.<br />One of the handiest sections is  &quot;Keeping it Looking Good,&quot; which takes one purposefully through  spring, early summer, late summer, fall, and winter, with relevant tasks  for the maintenance of containers, lawns, beds and borders, and pools  (water gardens). This is especially useful because so many gardening books  are big on the selecting and planting phases, but fall short on the  all-important maintenance piece of the gardening picture, resulting in all  too many newly-installed plants looking great this year, and not so great,  next year.  <br />In addition, there is a humility to the gardens in the  photographs that is not only appealing, but downright inspirational.  Sculpture, water, and assorted design elements are shown. A novice gardener  could easily replicate some of the peaceful and beautiful environments in  this book. <br />I've gardened haphazardly for years and, if not a  &quot;virgin,&quot;  amstill a novice gardener - and I found this book to  be useful, totally approachable, and beautiful to look at. The gardens vary  and could be relatively inexpensively accomplished. There's a good index,  too. A very nice book.	2000-05-31

The first half takes place in the several mental institutions around Chicago to which the seemingly average, but troubled, teenage Fleming is sent. It is never made  clear just what his diagnosis was, only that the treatments were cruel and  senseless. An appalling psychiatrist is profiled in Fleming's almost  deadpan voice.<br />In the second half of the memoir, Fleming's brother,   worldy New Yorker Uncle Ed (Edmund White),  comes - dramatically,  generously, and nearly unbelievably helpfully - to his nephew's rescue. He  invites him to live in his NY apartment. Once there, White takes over the  care and redemption of the boy. White is a saint, and it's obvious in this  story. Fleming is taken to a dermatologist in order to finally get proper  treatment for his severe acne, he is outfitted in great new clothes (the  shopping trip is memorable),tutoring is arranged for, and eventually, prep  school tuition paid. <br />White offers a benign and comforting acceptance  that the boy has never known. (And educates Fleming, who is straight,  regarding gayness and White's NYgay world of the 1970's - in what has to be  one of the most interesting and sweet aspects of this memoir).  Fleming  quite naturally and sensibly  falls under the spell of what has to be the  world's best living relative. Uncle Ed is everything and more that readers  of his many books can glean. He is sociable, witty, kind, generous to a  fault. He works on books and writing assignments, talks on the incessantly  ringing telephone, cooks for the boy, makes arrangements for his benefit,  and then, while Fleming does his homework in the kitchen, White leaves to  cruise gay bars, nightly.<br />White offers Fleming a tolerance and love that  literally seems to save the child's life.<br />Fleming has a troubled and  troublesome girlfriend, Laura. Their relationship is mapped for the reader,  and Ed's acceptance and support of that love affair is described.<br />This is  an incredible story. Things happen around this boy that are almost too  heartbreaking and sad to believe. He describes his family and his several  worlds with a clarity that is almost eerie. It seems reasonable to assume  that he went through a hell much more difficult that the usual teenage  stuff, and yet the reader never quite feels Fleming's sense of it. He  quotes White liberally, lists the novels and music that his Uncle  prescribed for him.  You can smell the sulphur treatments that Fleming had  to use, nightly - and hear the racket of Columbus Avenue outside of his  little bedroom is his uncle's apartment. <br />This remarkable story is full  of nearly photographic detail. The people are well drawn and memorable.  Fleming lacks any self-pity In fact, I was terrorized by the life Fleming  lived before being rescued by his uncle. Fleming's life in NY is pretty  unusual, too, despite the outward conventionality of &quot;coats and  ties&quot; from Barney's basement, and a prep school education. <br />This is  a very interesting story  of family, of Edmund White, and of his nephew,  Keith Fleming. Definitely worth reading.	2000-05-26

According the  the authors, a clinician who is unaware of the 'as-if' pathology  may have  a feeling that something is not quite right with the patient, but be  continuously unable to identify it - or to treat it. To add to the  elusiveness (of the pathology as well as its diagnosis), the authors write  that it's a given that all persons, to greater or lesser extent, experience  transient identifications - ideally,  on the way to a solid, developed  identity. So one of the difficulties that clinicians have in identifying  this pathology is that patients often seem pretty &quot;normal.&quot; It  takes a perceptive - and educated - clinician to competently diagnose and  treat these patients. This book would seem to make a sizable contribution  to that education. Many examples are provided, in a fluid and readable  format.<br />The authors rely on literature,  their clinical experience,and  what is obviously a great deal of their focused attention in order to  describe intervention strategies and techniques. The final chapter,  &quot;As-if Trends in Culture and Therapy,&quot; strives to place this  pathology in societal context. <br />There is an extensive bibliography and a  good index. I'm not in the field, rather an enthusiastic reader - but I  wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the  subject.	2000-05-16

They  provoke an immediate response: grief, and then - one hopes - an immediate check in the mail to &quot;Doctors without Borders&quot; or a comparable international relief organization. What seems strange and  distressing, however, is the intentional namelessness of each child. Each  startling and heartbreaking portrait is captionless. Maybe Salgado believed  them to be more effective, that way. You check the terse notes at the back  of the book. The subject, in this case a boy missing an arm, stares  forthrightly as the photogrpapher. He is identified as (for example):  &quot;38. The Natinga School Camp for displaced Sudanese. Southern Sudan,  1995.&quot; This Euro-bureaucratese is followed through-out. Each child is  unnamed by the author, and this is a failing of this book, and one which  serves to reinforce the initial crimes committed against these young  people.	2000-05-14

Kincaid's narrator suffers a grievous loss, and the  circumstances of her life reinforce and magnify that loss. No one has ever  protected her and she hangs onto life by a thread. Though amidst  &quot;family,&quot; she is truly alone in the world. Franz Kafka wrote that  one should only read novels that hurt, because those are the works that  raise consciousness. This straightforward and skillful novel is replete  with imagery of anger, sadness, and layers of detail that provoke utter  despair in the reader - and that's just Kincaid's point. Kafka would have  approved of this gripping story.	2000-05-14

One is that Pottruck is refreshingly but not inappropriately candid about more than business. By way of supporting his notion that consensus-building and compromise (not just &quot;leadership&quot;) is vitally important to any organization that seeks to succeed, he reveals that a reason that his (two) earlier marriages failed was not because he had a &quot;wife problem,&quot; but because he was, in fact, a &quot;husband problem.&quot; He claims that he had used the traditional &quot;executive&quot; operating methods within his marriages, meaning a &quot;you're in charge of this, and I'm in charge of that,&quot; way of doing things. Rather than acting as a reasonable &quot;division of labor&quot; model, this ended up being merely divisive, since it provided neither the experience of sharing and compromise within the marriage(s), nor the relationship-building practice that is so essential - in business and marriage. Wow! That's pretty interesting and univerally useful material for a business book. Pottruck's use of personal anecdote is appropriate and trenchant throughout. Wise authors, and a very worthwhile book.	2000-05-13

The fussy details  are often wonderful, as is the story.

She endured numerous hardships -- one of her children died of malnutrition  -- and a period of exile. She returned to Russia in 1939, but was so beset  by her circumstances that she committed suicide in 1941. These passionate  and autobiographical poems are deep and important. I don't know Russian, so  cannot comment on the translation.  From them one learns about Tsvetaeva  the artist: her subjects are love and transformation, nature, poetry, love,  and her complicated, exasperating country -- and, later, the bleakness  which enveloped her.

It is unified by its subject: childlessness, from the point of view (for the most part) of contemporary American women  who, for various reasons, are without children. This is, we learn, no small  thing.<br />The book is in three sections, &quot;Facing Choice,&quot; Knowing  Loss,&quot; and finally, &quot;Bearing Life.&quot; Some of the writers are  troubled, or grieving; some (Amy Hempel) are acidly funny, and many are  coping with daughterhood, rather than motherhood. There are childhood diary  entries, bitter memories, and great tenderness. The variety of  experience  in this anthology makes it an admirable and moving collection.	2000-05-11

She grew up in New York City, the daughter of an artist father, a powerful intellectual who became her mentor, and a mother who was a  dreamer, a bookworm, and a fabulous housekeeper. (Years later, the home  arts reappear in some of Schapiro's ground-breaking feminist  installations.) Striving to be an artist in a critically harsh and often  socially difficult male-dominated art world (anecdotes abound), Schapiro  created paintings, lithographs, and paper, paint, and fabric collages, and  later, original and amazing installations and collaborative works. She was  a teacher, too, and provided inspiration and community-building skills to  countless students and women artists. Her awareness of women's lives  informed much of her later work, and her observations are insightful and  powerful. This book is generously illustrated, and provides a detailed  biography as well as a picture of the various art scenes of this country,  midcentury and beyond. Schapiro's recollections and journal entries, along  with the author's careful and extensive research, form the source material.  First-rate book on a terrific artist.	2000-05-11

It's full of coherent details, narrated clearly. There are thousands of footnotes, and a huge bibliography. As reference material, I'm sure it's flawless. It's obvious  that the author accomplished his goal. But I wished for one meal described,  one suit of clothes worn, one grand (or not-so-grand) apartment described.  Alas, none of this is included in this story. Pitifully few tidbits flesh  out this text. It's business history set against a background of world  history, but neither the motivations nor the humanness of the Rothschilds  is part of the picture. Ultimately, it disappoints.	2000-05-09

Using obscure and fascinating source materials, case histories,and numerous  contemporary accounts, Brumberg (one author, despite Amazon's  mistaken  listing) presents the reader with the history of anorexia nervosa: its  roots in changing but always powerful popular notions of female  attractiveness; religion; psychology; social relations, and class.	2000-05-05

Camporesi, a Professor of Italian Lit. at  the University of Bologna, gives the reader the sights, smells, and tastes  of the tables of Europe, from the lowliest of the low classes, to the  pretentious dining rooms of the ruling classes. He traces food history, the  introduction of &quot;new foods,&quot; such as spices, &quot;unthinkable  meats,&quot; and &quot;unpredictable fruits,&quot; whether by the  discoveries of trade and travel, or changes in popular attitudes. Flowers  became a commodity.  Food fads, foods as status symbols and tokens of  refinement - are described. The birth of orangeade and lemonade, popular  notions of the curative or restorative powers of one food or another, are  all detailed - in an organized and satisying fashion.  Camporesi covers a  fascinating and thrilling subject with clarity and erudition. The book is  organized into fourteen chapters, and each can be read as a separate and  complete essay. Some of their titles: &quot;A Blissful and Drinkable  Eternity,&quot; &quot;The Botany of the Palate,&quot; &quot;Mad and  Startling Names.&quot; This book is really a must-read for any student of  European social history, culinary history, or popular culture.	2000-05-04

This  beautiful and in-depth book is lavishly illustrated both with plates of the  actual art works, and photos of the artists.

It is especially important as a set of historic writings. His kindness and intelligence prevails. Winnicott was a child psychoanalyst with an especially tender heart, and his love of  children, and respect for the efforts of families - often against unnerving  odds - is obvious. However, it should be noted that some of his theories,  while advanced in good faith and  respected at the time they were  introduced, have been disproven over the years. For example, enuresis  (bed-wetting) is now known to be something that psychoanalysis does not  &quot;cure.&quot; (It is often inherited, and afflicted children outgrow  it, period.) His articles on adolescence, written more than thirty years  ago, are not &quot;current,&quot; but still valuable. Winnicott's  discussion of autism, while humane and well-meaning and enlightened for its  time, is also somewhat off the mark, in light of  contemporary findings on  autism. Nonetheless, there is much that is valuable in this collection of  papers. &quot;The Niffle,&quot; with its report on a discussion about God  that a small boy has with his father, reminds the reader again that  Winnicott was not only capable of great love and understanding, but of  awe.<br />Definitely worth reading.	2000-05-01

She has written that since childhood, the thing she loved most was &quot;listening to people telling  me their stories.&quot; Her intense and fruitful intellectual engagement  with her work was well known, and was matched by her commitment to her  patients - their hearts and minds as well as their &quot;stories.&quot;   She specialized in, but was not limited to, consultations for diagnosis and  assessment, and was renowned for her skill and sensitivity in referring  more than 3,000 patients to especially suitable practitioners. In addition,  she had read Modern Languages at Oxford at a young student - medicine came  later - and so is a writer for whom the whole world is (sometimes) just  barely big enough. All but one of these clear, well-organized essays were  written in the past several years. In them she details her various  philosophies and opinions, and offers compassionate, insightful, and  sometimes thrilling stories from her clinical practice. (She successfully  treated one patient with ulcerative colitis with psychotherapy.) She  includes - and lovingly explains - many of her personal, relevant, and very  interesting opinions. She illuminates her interest and commitment to  Buddhism, and its helpfulness to her professional work, in &quot;Buddhism  and Psychoanalysis Revisited.&quot; In &quot;Endings,&quot; her topics are  death, the difference between worry and concern, termination of the  analytic relationship - and much more. She notes, not insincerely,  that  one of the worst things about her own death will be her inability to write  about it afterwards.<br />This is a fine collection which anyone with an  interest in psychoanalysis will find valuable and pleasurable.	2000-04-29

Davis presents the reader with how his young life looked,  smelled, sounded - and most importantly, how it felt. It's a remarkable  story of growing up in the now-lost world of the working-class Bronx  (Tremont Avenue) of the 1950's, the much younger of two sons of smart,  devoted, hard-working Jewish British immigrant parents, who are also  &quot;stone deaf,&quot; in his father's words. His mother lost her hearing  in childhood, and so can speak and be understood by the hearing world; his  father lost his as a baby. The circumstances surrounding these events are  examined, too. Their shared disability both constricted and greatly  enlarged his life.  <br />Young Davis was deeply loved by his parents, but  hyper-responsible and desperate for contact and life in the outside world.  Readers are given the terrific minutiae of his life as a child - the weekly  dinner menu at home, the interior of his family's apartment, life at  school, the kindesses of teachers and his parents' friends in the deaf  community, (lower case &quot;d,&quot; , then) the neighbors, and the  sights, sounds, smells of family life, including what he describes as a  nearly religious object (because of course his father couldn't hear  baseball on the radio): an Emerson Console TV. A very personal iconography  of Television -- he develops a superhero alterego he calls &quot;The  Zenth&quot; -- is part of the immense charm and humor of Davis' story.  (Years later, he finds the exact same Emerson Console in a junk shop in  upstate New York, another great scene in this book.) In the chapter  &quot;Honeymoon with Mom,&quot; he goes to England to visit relatives. The  cozy domesticity and accepting, familial love - the music in every house,  English candy - that he finds there is movingly described.  <br />From the  confines and immense security of his family's one-bedroom apartment Davis  learns difficulty and differentness of being the hypervigilant hearing  child - conscientious, smart, and emotionally desperate, sometimes - of  Deaf parents. There are two brothers in this family, and their interesting  but troubled relationship is examined with compassion and intelligence.  <br />Davis is a careful writer with a wonderful and loving sense of the  world. Not a word has been wasted. By the way, &quot;Zenth&quot; becomes a  Professor of English. His generosity in revealing his life to us is  immeasurable. The full picture of the old neighborhood is in itself an  excellent historical narrative. You can smell the food - and hear the  voices. It's also very funny at times. One of the best autobiographies I've  ever read.	2000-04-02

Westchester County, N.Y. contains densely developed towns and commercial nodes, run-of-the-mill  suburbs, gorgeous wooded areas, and lots of history.

(Grazing  animals, mainly horses, kept the woods back, then.) Shoumatoff has talked  to folks, read histories, and lived there.

A given is the unity of the the political and the personal. In addition,  there is a general agreement that the fragile individual's psychological  health is specifically threatened by modern society's abject failure to  provide adequate supports, which would provide a sort of societal  &quot;holding&quot; environment. In addition,  capitialism's  destabilization of the old social structures is cited in &quot;The Culture  of Uncertainty,&quot; by Paul Hoggett. In the background of many of these  essays are the ideas of British stalwarts Winnicott, Melanie Klein, WR  Bion. Many, many more thinkers are cited. Topics include nuclear war,  racism, sexism, politics,cynicism, changing notions of the self, witchcraft  (!) and AIDS.

He's obviously thought about this for years, and developed an embracing yet flexible stance. A polite rant against &quot;our current infatuation with science and technology&quot; seemed misplaced, though he included it in order to lobby for increased respect for nature. He's also opposed to pharmacological 'fixes' in favor of the obvious - though unaffordable for many - benefits of good long-term psychotherapy.  He skewers brief therapies - convinvingly. Essays on evil, and contemporary problems such as homelessness and drugs' misuse are included.

His entire adult life has been devoted to education and several other passions (music and art) and he hasn't missed anything. This book combines fiery and opinionated scholarship, a humane and  humanistic approach, and years of practical experience in education. Botstein: &quot;Going to school should be like taking swimming and driving lessons: preparation for something adults continue to wish to do.&quot; It's so on-the-mark that as I said above, I believe it should be required reading for anyone interested in education and/or the future of American culture. Botstein is a 'visionary' and fortunately also President of Bard College, so one would hope that he gets to put some of his ideas into practice. One point he makes is that students would be well served if teachers expended the same amouht of energy and enthusiasm on each child that, for example, coaches do on their student athletes. He wants schools to change, but he's utterly down to earth at the same time.

Palac's lucid recitation of the facts of her birth, happy midwestern childhood, and undergraduate years seem as though she's told them many, many times before. But she's witty and cute and very bright - also adventurous and &quot;fierce&quot; (her term). She's kind, too. But being brought up Catholic - and the grim-to-hilarious results - just isn't enough to explain her unusual and interesting career. The best - because the most heartfelt, detailed, and surprising - chapter is on an explicitly sexual, consensual, and obsessional relationship with a man, &quot;Stephen,&quot; whom she met online. She fell in love with him. He was reluctant to meet her, but Palac insisted, and they eventually did meet, and continued their love affair. (She's a romantic, too.) Palac is a spirited, smart, and magnetic person; I just wish she'd slowed down and gone a bit deeper inside herself (no pun intended) in order to write her autobiography, because she's well worth the time.	1998-05-04

I needn't have worried, because there is a world of experience and observation in these, along with masterful, thrifty use of language, attention to detail - and much love, yearning, and compassion. The voice is constant and consistent; the stories are told meticulously and with great clarity. &quot;The Woodcarver's Tale,&quot; centered on the narrator's father, is heartbreaking.

He can keep lots of ideas going simultaneously. In this substantial slim book he draws from literature (Proust, Tsvetaeva, Dostoyevsky, Christa Wolf, Kafka, Primo Levi, etc.), history, psychoanalytic studies, especially the works of Jacques Lacan. His own clinical practice informs his observations. He is a French medical doctor, and a Lacanian psychoanalyst - and in this book you must wrap your mind around Lacanian standards such as the Other - defined in a footnote on p. 25 as &quot;that who internally represents all the wealth of signifiers (yet who can nevertheless be imagined as relay for the first Other, the mother).&quot; His thoughts on substance abuse, addiction, eating disorders as they relate to mourning and melancholy are presented well. A main point is that depression and melancholy can't be &quot;cured&quot; with anything quick or pharmaceutical. Dr. Hassoun ranges far and wide in the service of his treatise; he quotes (among others) Thomas Mann, Andre Breton, Cocteau,  St. John of the Cross, and his interesting patients - fluidly and appropriately. Not for the lazy reader. The Lacanian linguistic acrobatics are hard for the uninitiated. This good book requires readerly effort, and is worth it.	1998-04-12

They sat down in the kitchen without any light on. It was between three and four o'clock. It must have seemed as if they were waiting for Eunie to come and tell them what to do.

Informed by her own prejudices and beliefs, she's come up with nearly four hundred pages of reasons for women to resent and dread the aging process, and the ways in which they will (inevitably, according to this book) be devalued.  The chapters on allopathic, traditional, and alternative treatments are informative, also a chapter on the 'old wives' and 'witches' of history, but overall the forecast is grim. Chapters with flippant titles such as &quot;Sex and the Single Crone,&quot; &quot;Misery,&quot; and &quot;All Your Own Fault&quot; seemed more polemical than informative. Many of Greer's generalizations and assumptions are just plain silly, for example her statement that aging men want the energy of youthfulness, while women are content with its appearance (p.135). She's against makeup, too -- and has damning words for wearers of it.	1998-03-04

The poignancy is here, too, because even though he didn't go to Harvard -- or even finish high school -- the guy was a beautiful father, kind and enthusiastically nurturing to his prized, brainy and adoring only child. Her yearning for her dad is nearly overwhelming. As an adult, she mourns the loss of the lock his hair -- and other artifacts -- she had for a while, after his death. But why does Gordon refer to herself as a Jew?  She is Catholic. (She merely looks more like her father than her mother.) For a purposeful Catholic writer to change religions in such a literary fashion seems manipulative and disingenuous.	1998-03-02

(Certainly honest accounts of women's experiences have been historically harder to come by, no pun intended, than masculine accounts and descriptions.) There were too few memorable personalities in this book. I could always &quot;tell&quot; that a man was writing the lesbian point of view.

This is the seamless, appropriately elaborate, and richly detailed adventure one experiences in reading this book. Troyat called this book a mere &quot;sentimental promenade,' but he was much too modest. Biographer of Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Elizabeth I and others, he had a pre-Revolutionary Russian early childhood, and the recollections of his (refugees-to-France) family members. In this book he enthusiastically and carefully recreates the sights, sounds, smells of daily life. The peasantry, workers and their everpresent sufferings and struggles, commerce, law, food, the gentry,  the tsar and his retinue, social life, the hapless serfs, plus plans, hopes, and dreams. The chapter &quot;Moscow's Many Faces&quot; is reminiscence,  and very informative. The research is the backbone of this work, which is greatly enriched and informed by Troyat's emotional ties to -- and sensory recall of -- the time and place.	1998-02-20

Queen's a reverential philosopher of sex, and she knows something about shyness, too. She admits it takes a good therapist to overcome this stuff, but lets us in on what she does know that might help! She never trivializes or minimizes her readers' hangups; she's a teacher of the best sort. Queen is experienced in all areas -- she's done everything -- and  knows and respects human sexuality of all stripes. She wants to teach its happiest and best expression to her readers. Along with some comparatively unusual practices are words of amazing wisdom. Good ideas for ways  to think about, talk about, and practice masturbation and safe sex with panache.  I might not follow her advice word for word (I'm still too shy), but I loved this book.	1998-02-19

As a child, she's proud of her eccentric, high-achieving mom; she's her best student, too. The household and small community is a bubbling stew of English coziness, friends and neighbors, superstition, religious fervor and misinformation, vulgarity, harsh pronouncements and oddly good-natured fanatical beliefs. <br /> The girl soaks it up -- to a point. Things begin to come apart, inevitably, and later still, as a teen, there's the narrator's growing knowledge that she is passionately, yearningly, and quite happily in love with a girl her age named Katy -- and no amount of exorcism will change that. The affair proceeds.  Winterson is smart enough to put it all together with grace and humor. Her bright and resourceful protagonist travels a great and difficult path, avoiding all the predictable plot formulas. No whining or self-pity, either. <br />  There is incisive wit, a smart and brave presentation of the (sometimes appalling) facts; very good use of myth, history and politics, fairy tales, Bible and church miscellany; amazing observation. This is a detailed and often funny picture of a truly strange household, a great girl, and there's a lot of love -- in this wonderful novel.	1998-02-08

This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten --  he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended.

It's a coming-of-age story set in Depression-era New York, somewhat autobiographical, and vividly drawn and atmospheric. Some of the descriptions are heartbreaking. The enormously popular author Robbins, who died last year, was simultaneously rejected by book critics and loved by millions of readers -- for more than three decades -- much like Krantz, Susann, et.al. He was a master of his genre: low-to-middle-brow page-turners containing the tried-and-true best-seller ingredients of his time: love, lust, money, dangerous men, glamorous, sensual, and/or &quot;fallen&quot; women, &quot;interesting&quot;-- vividly exotic, dangerous, or historical -- settings, and  memorable &quot;characters&quot;... Robbins reached much higher in this book,  and it's more than just formula. The dialogue rings true, there's a satisfying use of interior monologue, and his eye for details is sharp. It's a story with a lot of heart, and remains well worth reading.	1998-02-02

Winnicott (1896-1971) was a pediatrician and then a child analyst whose contributions to theories of child development and psychology (mothering, love, language, attachment, dependency, anxiety and many other topics) were enormous. Phillips' book illuminates Winnicott's body of  work and includes a chronology. The tone is respectful and insightful and Phillips' knack for skillful explanation and analysis is here. But he knows Winnicott's work -- and life -- by heart, and has written extensively on him elsewhere, and  occasionally in this work he meshes the two -- biography and work -- so seamlessly that I wished for more. As an intro to Winnicott's ideas, this is first-rate.	1998-02-02

With apologies to Chas.Shultz, this book reminds me of an updated, even nerdier version of &quot;Love is Walking Hand in Hand, &quot; and it's a puzzling disappointment.

A wonderful preface by Swedish film writer Stig Bjorkman, an article by photographer Per Kirkeby, and an introduction by Von Trier.   Photos and film info, even the locations list. The story is compelling, obsessional, intensely carnal, heart-breaking, and critical of doctrinaire religion. Von Trier claims that, quite simply, it is a story about &quot;good.&quot; He even advances the theory that love -- physical, sexual love -- can heal. Not a welcome notion in Calvinist Northern Scotland (or  many other places, for that matter), the setting for the story. It was interesting to see how von Trier's much-touted (by the actors) commitment to improvisation allowed last-minute script changes -- and there were many. The book is beautifully assembled, translated gracefully from the original Danish. It's definitely great.	1998-01-22

This autobiographical novel is many things: well-written, simply told, generous to his quite wonderful family and the place he grew up in. It's also heartbreaking because the reader knows from the outset that Grumley has died of AIDS; the introduction is a beautiful one, a eulogy really, by Edmund White.  A good book for gay teenagers -- the observant and comforting portrayal of childhood, adolescence, and (blissfuly untormented) emerging sexuality amidst the comfort of a good family is refreshing and heart-warming. The descriptions of nature, people, and New Orleans are precise and seem effortlessly well-wrought. The requisite trip to early- 1960's California is (sanely) made brief, and Grumley returns home to Iowa none the worse for wear -- and ready to take on his future. I really liked this man and the story he tells, and it breaks my heart to know that's he's gone.	1998-01-19

Most of all: about Edmund White and his lover Hubert Sorin. Economical yet enjoyably gossipy, kind-hearted, opinionated, informative. Achingly sad, though, because Hubert is dying of AIDS, and in fact does die at the book's end. Definitely worth reading -- especially for fans of Edmund White. Engagingly illustrated by Sorin, who was trained in architecture and took up drawing when he became ill.	1998-01-19

There is heartbreak and sadness and inconsolable pain in these characters' lives. But unfortunately, Roy's clutter-it-up approach interferes.	1998-01-19

Its subject is the intoxicating, intimidating, seductive, and ultimately cruelly destructive hip gay demimonde: the ruling class there -- and its &quot;subjects.&quot; Gifted and kind-hearted novelist-critic-memoirist-teacher Edmund White's first novel, and the one that got him noticed, then praised by Nabokov and many others. It describes a lost world, but has much to say about the one remaining. Beautifully constructed and definitely worth reading.	1998-01-10

In fact, it's historiography, and the title and subtitle are a bit misleading. It's as much about Poland as about the shtetl, and is -- incomprehensibly -- lacking an index. Hoffman grew up in Poland, emigrating as a teenager, and brings a compassionate mind to the historic problems of that country. Definitely worth reading.	1997-11-25

These and other disorders of self-esteem are discussed by this compassionate and careful Swiss psychoanalyst. This is not a 'blame the victim' thesis, but a psychoanalytic exposition of a disturbing and pervasive European and American mental health topic. According to Battegay, several discrete disorders have at their root early emotional (and sometimes physical) unmet hunger and /or a  crazy-making lack of infant tactile stimulation. Result:adolescents and adults with bottomless cravings for love and/or attention; sometimes food, alcohol, drugs; and attendant insatiable longings. &quot;Eating disorders&quot; are but one of the symptoms of this dysfunction. A chapter on diabetic patients, and another on gastrointestinal disease are especially interesting.Lots of hard data. His findings  and those of other researchers and observers seem well-grounded, his observations are often quite keen, but some of his sociopolitical conclusions now seem a bit outdated.However, he has a treatment plan which is sensible and compassionate. Some of his data is forty years old -- but still relevant. The epilogue contains kind and wise 'advice' for the future. Worth reading.	1997-11-24

Readers with interests in folk culture and history, Russian studies (history, literature, whatever) and/or culinary history will feel like they've struck gold. The thirteen scholarly pieces, some with a few illustrations, cover a wealth of topics (see table of contents above)-- consistently well. It's anything but dry; Pamela Chester's article on the relationship between (state-) tormented poets Marina Tsvetaeva and Osip Mandelstam (and their uses of food as symbol and, tragically, their deprivation of it, later) is heartbreaking. Peasantry, the gentry, and the Eastern Orthodox church; brilliant fussbudget Tolstoy's vegetarianism is in here; the uses of food in the writing of Dostoyevsky; fasting and food fashions; Catherine the Great (hardly any tastebuds; hearty interest in 'presentation'); the new Soviet state with its ambitious dreams for the citizenry, and the ultimate cynical mess that resulted. Food as power, class marker, moral symbol, and solace. The roots of asceticism (Orthodox church).Unfortunately, Jewish life and gulag life has been omitted, and a careful list of the prices of foodstuffs in St. Petersburg in Catherine's time is all rubles and kopeks... so I couldn't tell what I might have been able to afford.. What's here, though, is very good. I'll look for Volume 2.	1997-11-24

But there's a chilly lack of heart in this novel which all the brains and visual effects in the world can't fix. One of the characters, Blanche, says of her brother, &quot;His eyes revealed more than the usual contempt common to his kind of Englishman (...) pure hatred.&quot;  Flanagan's meticulous emotionless descriptions almost seem like a form of cruelty.On second thought, is that the point? Puzzling.	1997-11-22

Camporesi posits a startling theory: Europeans lived in various ongoing states of &quot;collective vertigo,&quot; hallucination and illness brought on by starvation or the eating of tainted foodstuffs, commonplace at that time. This state of affairs, Camporesi asserts, was promoted and exacerbated by various medical, social, and religious establishments.(The medical establishment of Bologna, for example, codified the foods 'medically' appropriate for rich and poor, resulting in additional loss of life.) Hunger was the central organizing principle in the lives of so many. The notorious famine years were times of acute rather than chronic starvation -- and &quot;incredible and repugnant substances&quot; were often eaten, often with fatal results. It's all here : &quot;Terrible noises, worms, vermin, ghosts and goblins,&quot; opiates, visions, toxic brews, exorisms, violence, and always death and more death. Christianity's scant words of encouragement are quoted, too. This study is replete with evidence from literature, political history, the history of medicine and religion, and contemporary accounts. It's well-organized and elegantly presented. No illustrations, but the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch would work well. A great book.	1997-11-21

They're in here, though. It's heartbreaking to read of everyday annoyances and delights, and to know the fate that was soon to befall many of these diarists. &quot;A Chronicle of the Year 1937&quot; is almost more than I could bear. A sad and good book, well worth reading.	1997-11-20

She's been practicing since 1972.  I love these essays because she is hopeful, helpful, and very wise. Her references are her clinical practice, art, philosophy, and literature. She reads, listens, and describes -- widely and well in these essays. Rarely, she lapses into jargon (rocky reading for the lay person), but usually avoids it.  Some of her topics:  wordlessness and the unthinkable;the silent patient and the meanings of silence (she isn't at all afraid of it); sin and conscience; the squaring of the practice of psychoanalysis with her chosen practice of Buddhism. Coltart reveals herself to be  thoughtful and remarkably humane; open to the world, and at the same time disciplined and clear in her beliefs and goals. Wonderful reading and rereading.	1997-11-20

The size and the scope of the daughter's bereavement take up the whole of this slim book. She's had a lifetime of gentrified confusion, short bursts of happiness,   rejection, and grief. Levy recounts this skillfully and stylishly, and with a blameless bitter heart. The remembered details of her childhood (toys, clothes, mundane events) take on a burning importance, as if they're all that's left -- after a catastrophe. There's a growing genre of these memoirs of yearning and loss, and this one is a fine addition.	1997-11-20

Garden State is Moody's first novel. It's a messy story about a (thank God) vanished time. It was really interesting to read, because his subsequent writing just gets better and better. It's bound by a plot at once  complicated and sublimely simple.  The several main characters, basically nice-people male and female twentysomethings in the 'eighties, can't quite 'leave home,' are are often stoned, drunk, or otherwise debilitated. They sleep late, smoke, party, drive around, play music, fret about their moms, (there's a freakish car accident), experience despair, visit the sick, poke through piles of laundry in search of leggings, hang out, wear black nail polish, have desultory sex, and reflect rather thoughtfully on things while spending a month (one of them does this) or so in a pretty nice mental hospital.There is wonderful yearning for meaning and love -- also oblivion and ecstasy. The whole thing takes place in NJ, which is also used as a symbol of -- something or other.  Great sense of place, and a hip sort of warmth and compassion is in there, too. This novel is strange, a little bit difficult to love, but worth the trouble.	1997-11-20

It's her first novel, written as an undergraduate (and reworked a few yrs later when she was a young mother.) She was obviously passionate, perceptive, brainy, busy, and full of life.The protagonist Anna notices, thinks about, and feels things -- intensely. The autobiographical story is interesting, and less deeply upholstered than  Byatt's subsequent novels. The narrator's  immediacy is compelling, and the young woman's struggles to define herself within (and separate from) her intellectually consuming and  powerful family are well drawn. Lots of 'characters,' the Byatt ear for speech and eye for the telling detail. Memorable escapades and love affairs, too It's intense and brimming with energy and life.	1997-11-19

The narrator, Timothy, is a much-loved child in a middle class home. The voice is intimate and childishly sincere and perfectly suited to Lodge's intentions: sympathetic understanding of a very likable kid. Characters are affectionately but not cloyingly drawn, and bad things happen, too. Eventually Timothy goes to postwar US-occupied Germany to visit his much older sister (in Lodge's actual past, it was an aunt). It's a heady experience. Some of the best Lodgeisms are in this novel: the untrustworthiness of  happiness, which he fears is simply &quot;a ripening target for fate;&quot; the  meaning of travel; leavetaking and loss; loyalty to home and the known vs. the desire for adventure and newness; the powerful lure of the material world; love and eroticism and their yearned-for occasional convergence.Funny, too. This novel is a gem and a great yarn besides.	1997-11-19

In much the same way that Philippe Aries took the subject of childhood and illuminated it for all time in &quot;Centuries of Childhood,&quot; fellow French writer (although Bulgarian-born) and Lacanian psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva examines depression and melancholia. She comes at it from various angles and filters: fine arts, literature, history, philosophy, religion, and of course psychology. She posits psychoanalysis as a (really THE) 'counterdepressant' -- convincingly. This is great highbrow stuff: chapters with titles like&quot;Beauty, the Depressive's Other Realm,&quot; and &quot;Life and Death of Speech.&quot; Death, suicide, the inevitable gloom resulting from loss of maternal, later erotic,  love; all are insightfully discussed -- even rather tenderly. If you're depressed BLACK SUN won't make you more so -- and if you're feeling okay to begin with, it's a terrific scholarly study.	1997-11-18

A chapter on world-class hypochondriac James Boswell, biographer of Samuel Johnson, is a highlight, as is a chapter on European treatments and philosophies of this malady. Imagined illness' role in childhood, among the elderly, in other cultures; its function in relationships -- all discussed. The historic stuff is great. The book falters on the contemporary problems of hypochondria. Baur's clinical approach seems sensible and pragmatic, and I would suspect that it doesn't work.Can hypochondriacs really 'unlearn' it? I wish she had dug a little deeper in her final chapter, &quot;Getting Better.&quot; Definitely worth reading.	1997-11-18

A comprehensive guide to real working cowboys' -- not in the movies or on TV; on the open range of Wyoming, in the old days -- clothing and  equipment.  Hundreds of black and white photos and drawings; illustrations from historic catalogs; schematics of tack; diary entries and contemporary descriptions; history and the reasons behind the  specific gear of the cowboys (and girls) of the Northern Plains from 1870 to just until the Great Depression. The authors are historians and give us the names of, and the stories behind, the people and the great stuff; Levi's of course, but how about 'Rodeo Booger Reds'? -- a would-be competitor. Underwear -- you can imagine how important Union Suits were before central heating. (They could be ordered in white, grey, ecru, light blue, and, finally, in 1909: pink.) Shirts, jackets, leather goods and fabrics. Horse gear. There's even a chapter on Camp Equipment; now you can build a chuck wagon.  Loads of well-captioned photos, many portraits; you're 'there.' Best of all, the tone is enthusiatically academic rather than 'nostalgic.' This is the real thing -- a scholarly, well-organized and well-written book about a vanished world.	1997-11-18
