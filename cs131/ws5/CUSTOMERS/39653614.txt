Colquitt is reluctant to acceot the notion being an ordered and rational person but eventually she is driven to confront the house and the evil etched into its very walls . <br />This is a superbly ambiguous novel .Colquitt firmly believes the house is demonic -other readers may conclude the house is simply the scapegoat and the real evil comes wrapped in the desires and actions of its residents and neighbours .Is the evil in the house or in us ,in our fragile and surface value systems ? Ms Siddons lets us make up our own mind   <br />Colquitt is not an especially likeable person -she is emotionally detached ,a little vain and self absorbed ,and the changes she faces during the novel are profound .Nothing in the book is quite what it seems . <br />The book came to my notice when Stephen King wrote about it in his collection Dance Macabre ,and in the essay covering this novel he pointed out the novel may well resonate more with women -to a woman says King her homeis her world to a greater extent than with men .Such a view seems to ignore trends of the past 20 plus years and I maintain that this tale of evil at work in the nuclear family will chill most readers .Do not expect a gross-out however -this is cool,elegant and distant in its style . <br /> <br />A minor modern classic in the horror vein .Please give it a go	2005-08-26

The description of their fog bound journey in a dinghy through the narrow waters of the Memmert Balje is a superb piece of writing and the atmosphere of the islands is brilliantly captured .The two men are adequately characterised heroes and in \\"Clare Dollman \\" he created a spirited and personable heroine . <br />The book is a precursor to the modern spy story and memorable for that reason amongst others . <br />The book is no longer topical but it is still eminently readable	2005-06-15

Please be advised ,if this is your own situation ,that all the movie takes from the book is its title .Everything else has been jettisoned including the tone of the story .The movie was gently comedic in tone being a parody of the Western as well as a Western in its own right .Brand's novel is altogether more serious in tone being essentially a straightforward revenge Western  <br /> <br />Destry ,while not exactly a criminal ,has achieved some notoriety in the town of Wem -he is not noted for backing down when trouble raises its head ,and is handy with gun ,knife and fists .This has earned him many enemies one of whom ,\\"Chet\\",while posing as his friend sets him up on a charge of train robbery .He is convicted by a jury made up of his enemies and sent to prison for 10 years despite a powerful plea of innocence and an exposure of the juror's ulterior motives .He vows revenge and when released  after 6 years the jurors flee the town in fear of their lives . <br />Yet he seems a broken man -timorous and shattered in spirit by his incarceration .Encouraged by this two of the jurors ,The Ogden brothers ,test his mettle in a gun battle and are shot down .Destry was play acting -he still intends revenge .Two jurors are broken by means short of death -shown as cowards or having their links to political intersts exposed .Others are hunted down and shot in fair fight  <br />Chet plots with the remaining jurors to kill Destry all the while posing as his friend and Destry can only rely on a hero worsshipping boy and Charlotte the woman who loves him . <br />The book is by todays standards somewhat windily written and the sermonising tone sits poorly with todays  literary taste but overall this is a good read and the hero is shown as not the fastest gun or most handy in a fight being bested by the baddie at a critical time  <br /> <br />I am not sure that it will appeal beyond the ghetto of the Western readership but its worth your time if you have an interest in the genre and in vintage pulp writing	2005-06-06

If the narrative now and again bogs down -which it does -there are ample compensations  namely in the strongly drawn characters  like the Italian clan and Maria's protector ,Michael ,and the pathetic celebrity stalker Kevin . <br />Its a rich and rewarding book full of incidental detail and some fine minor figures ,like Kalpanna's father ,Dr Jaggadanam  . <br />Enjoy it for its insight into the corrosive impact of too early fame and as a study in deracination -the plight of the person who takes flight from a small place to a larger stage only to discover they are at home in neither one . <br /> <br />The ending is upbeat and cautiously optimistic -would that its inspiration were around to read it . <br />	2005-05-20

Hall Nightingale Series Edition)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Qiietly abrasive tale of murder and deception	Margaret Yorke ,while an English woman who writes crime novels ,should not really be bracketed with the so called Golden Age writers like Christie or Allingham .She is less interested than such writers in creating classic whodunnits ,and instead looks at the deceptive reality that lies behind the peaceful outward apearance of things .The Point of Murder-originally published in the US as The Come on -illustrates this neatly .There is no secret as to the identity of the killer ;the murder is described and the book ,on the action level is really the tale of two separate hunts .One is the police hunt for the killer and the other is the tracking by the killer of potential witnesses and his attempts to eliminate them .  The novel opens with two sharp pen portraits .Kate Wilson is a middle aged spinster  looking after her venomous and deeply selfish mother who is nowhere near as ill as she pretends and compenstaes for her deep disappointment with life by treating her daughter like a skivvy ,one constantly at her beck and call .But Kate has a secret -at regular intervals ,feigning visits to a friend who is in the know ,she vanishes for weekends at a small hotel in the countryside where she has assignations with Doctor Stern a partner in the medical practice where she works as an administrator .One time she comes across a woman,Sandra King .who is struggling to change a puntured trye on her car .She is unable to be much help but a passing encylopedia sal;esman ,Gary Browne ,comes to the rescue .  Gary is a plausible young man who thinks women are fair game for his charms and he follows Sandra home and kills her when she resists his increasingly forceful attempts to get her into bed .  He remembers Kate as a witness and also that she had mentioned the hotel where she was staying ,under the name Mrs Havant ,and he feels he must find and kill her to eliminate a witness able to connect him to the dead Sandra   The trail takes him eventually to Kate and he takes her prisoner withthe aim if killing her ;meanwhile the police are on his trail.  The book is as much character study as police procedural or crime novel ;Gary is an opportunist ,a man whose several jobs bespeak a footloose man with grandiose ambitions he is not dynmaic or clever enough to transform into reality ,not evil; just predatory . He is a man who sees no reason why he should not have what he wants ,simply because he wants it and rationalises his attack on Sandra on the grounds that she was \\" asking  for it \\" Kate is a resourceful woman ,clear thinking and realistic ,able to take care of herself in an emergency   The book is also a study in hypocrisy -beneath the facade of middle class British life sexual secrets and snobbery abound and there is no real sense from the book that justice will be done .Browne may well escape lightly ,it is hinted ,and Kate a relatively  blameless figure ,sees her vestiges of happiness threatened by events over which she has no real control    The prose is uncluttered and clear .The characterisation is diamond bright .The police work is accurately shown if undramatic   Lovers of the crime novel may feel happier with books where the stress is on detection rather than the consequences of criminal acts but overall this is a well written book that will appeal to those who like UK crim novelists,such as Rendell and James where detection is secondary to social analysis	2005-05-19

Her father is frequently absent in Boston and the rest of the family consists of her older brother William , plus her stepmother Audrey .Audrey is disliked by the children and she in turn dislikes them neither parety being unduly concerned to conceal their opinions from each other .It is a loveless marriage on all sides . <br />Amanda is thrown much upon her own devices and befriends the reclusive and notorious Lizzie  who teaches her card tricks ,her experise being the result of hours of solitary practice ,a bye product of loneliness and social ostracisation . <br />The ,one hot August day ,murder rears its ugly head .The stepmother is murdered -cut to pieces with an axe .The local police chief suspects Lizzie ,based on past experience ( he was an officer in Falls River during the Borden murders).There are other supects however .William and Audrey quarrellled violently on the day of the murder and he has gone missing ;nor does Mr Burton have a watertight alibi .The town has racial tensions and some would like to pin the crime on a local black tradesman seen in the area while others are persuaded it was the work of anarchists ( The book makes explicit the fear of anarchism and Bolshevism that wracked America after WW1 -alluding to the Sacco and Vanzetti case ,explicitly )  <br />Employing a shrewd local lawyer ,and a Pinkerton agent Lizzie resolves to uncover the mystery as much for her own safety as anything else --she is pelted by the mob who hover ghoulishly outside herhome )It builds to a climax whose grand guignol qualities are slightly at odds with the  tone of the bulk of the book ./ <br />The author  shrewdly teases us with the possibility of her guilt both for the crime in the book and Falls River -similarities between the two are pointed out ( The death of a step-parent ;the modus operandi .the very hot weather ;the physical similarities of the dwellings in which the murders took place ) <br />It is satisfying as a mystery ,has a convincing narrator and leaves the figure of Lizzie Borden what it should always be --a fascinating enigma . <br /> <br />Well written and satisfying on every level	2005-02-25

A star system is included ranging from zero to five stars .In some instances the review will have a list of other movies on similar themes ,as for example The Alamo(1960 ) which then gives titles like Lone Star and The Last Command 'although not the  Jim Bowie biopic The Iron Mistress  <br />The last section of the book is a listing of movies by historical period ranging from pre classical antiquity to Desert Storm ;and there is also a listing of key directors and their war related output .The book is well but not lavishly illustrated throughout . <br /> <br />It is a useful guide if you want to know what movies have been made about particular wars and war theatres .The reviews are not massively detailed but serve as some guide to their subject matter and quality -although the latter is a value judgement .,like all reviews  <br /> <br />The bibliography is useful in steering interested readers towards other -more specialist guide but this is a good introduction to a wide ranging subject.I read the 2000 edition -and obviously movies released since then are not included  <br />	2005-01-14

The true theme of the novel is &quot;the worm in the bud &quot;--how a respectable facade can hide moral corruption and a lack of self -knowledge ;the chief abuser is persuaded he is motivated by love rather than cynical and inexcusable exploitative impulses.<BR> It is a tawdry tale ,heavy and oppressive with an air of sleaze and corruption hanging like a pall over the whole novel.There is physical and forensic violence here but the real violence is one of atmosphere -a miasma of corruption hangs over the events described in the book and the realisation of this quality is the ultimate triumph of the novel .It makes it honest but does make for comfortable reading and some will find the subject matter inherently disquieting .<BR>The events of the previous novel I referred to earlier that impact on the book are more to do with character than plot -Tolliver and town pediatrician / pathologist Sar Linton are striving to re-ignite their relationship , hard driven cop Lena is still suffering the trauma of rape which she endured in Blindsighted and struggling to rebuild her professional and personal life .<BR>This is well written but the absence of any lighness in atmosphere or incident make the book heavy going .<BR>Slaughte is immensely talented but for my money need to lighten up a little -it would throw the themes of her stories into starker relief but adding a contarsting shade .	2004-07-02

They have however become more formulaic and less interesting in tone .<BR>This is an instance for the book romantices Holliday the shootist and gambler whom we first encounter when he is diagnosed with the consumption that was eventually to kill him .Leaving his native Atlanta and his betrothed , his cousin Mattie ,he sets out for the West hoping the climate will prolong his life .From town to town he drifts building a reputation as a mankiller and a gambler and Braun is at pains to point out his killings were always in self-defence and at the expense of cardsharps and cheaters .<BR>The novel develops a repetitive quality as the incidents are remarkably similar and the middle part of the books is laboured and faintly tedious enlivened mainly by his sparky relationship with the saloon girl Katie Elder ,an unregenerate prostitute and with the loyal Lottie a faro dealer whose love and regard for Holliday are neatly and unsentimentally etched .There is an effecting passage dealing with the severing of his engagement to Mattie that is quietly moving .<BR>Overall while the setting changes --Cheyenne .Texas , Dodge City -the pattern of building a reputation , killing in self -defence and moving on ,does not and eventually becomes a tad wearisome .<BR>In the final part of the book we read of his growing friendship with Wyatt Earp but the book ends before he links with Wyatt in the most famous incident of his careeer ,the O K Corral shootout .It ends with Doc in transit for Tombstone and that notable if over hyped fight .<BR>Doc is well drwan by Braun -a romantic ,doomed and erudite man with a penchent for Shakespeare ( a scene where he defends a classical actor from the drunken saloon patrons is pure My Darling Clementine ) .The dry sardonic graveyard humour of the man is compelling and the aura of death surrounding him comes from within as well as being based on his proficiency with guns <br />Plain and unfussy style is placed at the service of a fictionalised chronicle rather than a novel <br />Its okay but too long and the author has done better.	2004-06-14

The Egyptial Hall was an actual building and was  established by the Victorian entrepreneur and magician J N Maskelyne ,who has a brief role in proceedings although the chief magician is another real figure ,Makelyne's protege David Devant .  Holmes and Watson are called in by a performer at Egyptian Hall, a conjurer named Cyrano .During the course of his act a priceless ring has gone missing  and the owner wants it back .The intrepid duo visit the theatre where things take a darker turn with the murder of Cyrano .  The obvious suspect is an enraged inventor who claims Cyrano had stolen one of his illusions but -of course ,this being a mystery ,the obvious suspect is innocent .  The murderer is unmasked on the stage of Egyptian Hall and the \\"new fangled \\"device the cinematograph plays a key role in exposing the killer   It is a bit thin from the mystery angle and one glaring anachronism rears its head when Holmes speaks of the sum of 30 pence -a mere 100 years before the decimalisation of the currency ! Holmes is an man of many parts but clairvoyant is not one of them !  Quick read at less than 200 large print pages and just about worth it if you are a devoted Sherlockian	2004-03-20

Tom and Scott are somewhat idealised figures-good looking,athletic and popular and are btheweakest parts of the book .There are some well etched supporting figures like the lesbian bar ownwer Daphne and the ultimate bad guy is a strikingly drawn figure with an outwardly plausible excuse for his depridations. <BR>The dialogue is dull and the plotting mechanical but it remains just about readable.	2003-10-27

Billy  witnesses a murder ,and the book then becomes essentially a tale of two hunts.The hunt for the killer of Lisa Ramsey ,under the leadership of  LA detective Petra Connor ,and there are two principal suspects--her former husband ,the TV star Cart Ramsey and his business manager ,Greg Baulch.Then there is the search for Billy ,a srearch involving the killer ,the boy friend , the police and others after the reward posted for information on the killing.The case is not solved until there have been further killings and some narrow escapes for Billy.<br />Kellerman is a big seller with a loyal readership and has not achieved these feats without being able to produce page turners of some quality .The book is strong on narrative and there is a good depth of characterization not to mention some sharp criticism of police bureaucracy and the way in which fear of publicity in potential high profile  cases can retard a police investigation.The juggling of the two searches is dexterously handled<BR>My only real reservation is an old bugbear of mine -excessive length .The book runs nearer 600 pages than 500 and much of this is due to what strikes me as padding --for instance ,the domestic worries of Petra's partner contributes nothing to the evolution of the plot and merely serves to slow proceedings down.<br />Good solid read and fans of the regular series character Alex Delaware may like to know he makes a cameo appearance in the last chapter	2003-08-29

In his study of the crime novel &quot;Bloody Murder &quot; the critic and novelist Julian Symons made out a persuasive case for Caleb Williams to be considered the first fully fledged crime novel to be published.As a contrast Scott Bradfield ,writing in the book &quot; Horror ;the Best 100 books&quot;(edited by Jones and Newman)included the book as his choice for the best horror title.<BR>I am more persuaded by Symons categorization -although there are elements of the Gothic novel present that lend support to Bradfields assertions and it strikes me as an interesting paradox that such a pioneering work in the crime literature pantheon is one that fundamentally contradicts so many of the values espoused by later crime writers with their social and intellectual conservatism.Caleb Williams is the work of a political radical , an Anarchist and supporter of the French Revolution,many of whose friends and associates were in prison for sedition and treason at the time he wrote the book eg Tom Paine.<BR>Caleb is a young man taken into the employ of the local squire Falkland ,a kind and public spirited man but one who harbours a secret ,which is concealed in a room that Caleb is instructed he must never visit .He disobeys and finds evidence that Falkland is a murderer ,guilty of a crime for which another man was hanged.He is forced to flee to escape Falkland's vengeance ,a flight that sees him throw in his lot with a robber gang amomgst others.<BR>On one level it is a tale of pusuit and flight ;on another it is a swingeing critique of injustice ;an injustice Godwin sees as inherent in any oligarchial political system.<BR>The first part of the book -which establishes Falkland as an essentially kind and decent man-is heavy going for modern readers but as the novel gains pace and Caleb's plight intensifies it becomes a more gripping tale .<br />Recommended for crime fiction devotees who want to see what the  pre Poe practitioners were doing ;it will also interest students of therelatively unexplored highways and bye ways of the English novel.	2003-07-23

It opens in May 1997 the day after New Labour has been returned to power in the UK following 18 years of Conservative government.The narrator is Colin Pinnock a Labour MP who is designated a junior minister in the Department of Education.He receives a note thrust under the door of his London apartment aking the stark question \\"Who do you think you are?  It prompts him to undertake a search for his family origins which lead back to a minor sixties political scandal.This is clearly modelled on the real life affair of Lord Lucan who went missing after allegedly killing his wife.

Most people in the book remind us of Thorteau's dictum that the mass of mankind have lives of quiet desperation.San Francisco and   its less touristy parts in particular are well realised.<BR>Not the best starting point for the series and among its weaker entries but devotees of the author and/or genre will probably not complain unduly	2002-11-06

Looking good takes money.The author conveys with admirable accuracy the thousand and one humiliations of life on the margins-where choice is a hollow mockery and every stroll past shopping malls and restaurants further drives a nail into the coffin that is now housing your self -respect<BR>Some of the employment practices detailed are truly odious especially advertising vacancies which do not exist merely in order to build up a picture of the labour market in your area,and the interview conducted without human agency.The wiping clean of overtime dockets and curious induction practices further shame the employers and the nation that permits such practices.<BR>I was uncomfortable with the idea of the book -a white middle class journalist \\"slumming\\" always has an out which those about whom she is writing do not possess but she has performed a service in raising the issue of poverty both of money and expectation.The pity of it is she is more likely to be read by those already sympathetic to the issues and people involved-it should really be read by the advocates of such pernicious nonsense as \\"monetarism\\" and that comic modern shibboleth \\"trickledown\\"<BR>I worked construction,drove trucks,swept the streets for 20 years due to family necessity and what got me through into an education which turned things around was blind cussedness and family support to die for.Others-equally bright ,equally courageous and less white, will never get the chance<BR>What emerges for me here is that we are not talking race or gender but power and until economic power is distributed with more compassion then America will be failing to ensure equality of opportunity for all its citizens.<BR>I never criticise what I dont love,and this is written from love because I still believe in the American dream Pity more CEO's dont.<BR>Longer on description than diagnosis though it is this is still a powerful starting point for debate and the book is worth yur time especially if you instintively shy away from its arguements and its subject matter	2002-08-20

She is capable,tough and resourceful the kind of person you want as a friend but her headstrong tendencies troubled me a tad.professionally,she struck me as quite hard to take and I was nodding agreement when the sympathetic cop Ryan asks at one point \\" Is there anyone on the planet who can get through to you ?\\" She goes against procedure,places herself in danger and muddies the water a time or two.Not a team player our Tempe .We need people like her but my can they be a trial .<BR>I think I am going to like the series though since I rather like exasperating heroines and heroes .They give us a book we can argue with rather than one slipping away unremembered.<BR>The faults seem those common to a debut and I look forward to more books	2002-08-12

Several attempts to unearth the hoard having come to nought the novel centres on the attempt of a specialist treasure hunting company ,Thalassa,headed by the intense Captain Neidermann to retrieve the 2 billion dollar booty.He is aided by a team of specialists in their fields(fustain English academic,tetchy computer freak,beautiful  archaelogists etc)and by Malin Hatch the hero whose brother had perished in the treasure caves some decades earlier<BR>All is not plain sailing.The local minister actively opposes the venture,claiming the treaure is cursed,the mission is plagued by accidents and computer malfunction,and riven by internal tensions within the team which ultimately erupt into violence<br />At the heart of the tension  is the mysterious sword which turns out to harbour a deadly secret.<br />Characterisation is good,the build up of tension adroit and the climax powerful<br />I just feel that some minor excisions and the concomittant shortening of the book would have made it an even better read but I can think of many worse ways to while away a journet or a rainy evening.	2002-01-31
