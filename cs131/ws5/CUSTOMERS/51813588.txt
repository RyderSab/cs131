He uses the concept of &quot;paracolonialism&quot; to discuss a range of Renaissance texts, some well known, some not.  The intelligence of Archer's prose and analysis make this book an welcome oasis in the increasingly arid desert that Renaissance studies has become. Old Worlds will also be of deep interest to anyone working in colonial and post-colonial theory.	2002-04-08

But little has changed in terms of gender bias.  The mother still typically gets the kids, especially if they are young.  After my ex took our daughter out of state when our daughter was two and remarried (her third husband), she thought I should disappear and made visitations increasingly difficult.  After five years of this, I went to court thinking I could get better visitations, and, at the least, peace of mind by having he the agreement redone.  Although I don't regret going to court because my ex was forced to abide by a clearer agreement, I ended up paying more in child support even though my ex made twice what I did at the time, about 15k to my attorney, and had LESS time with my daughter. (I have a Ph.D., a full time job as a prof, no criminal record, no substance abuse, etc., and I had joint custody when my ex left the state.  Even though my ex taught one class a semester as a prof, she had our daughter in full time daycare, and even though she described her new husband as &quot;abusive&quot; both to her and to our daughter, the shrink didn't care.)  In my state, the court appoints a &quot;guardian ad litem,&quot; a shrink who reports to the court.  His or her decision is basically final.  You can't take hoim to court and examine him.  What happens in cases of conflict, I learned later, is that the shrink always shortens the visitations.  So if you are not the custodial parent and a man, the deck is really stacked against you.  Thus, I would say that if you can manage to negotiate with your ex out of court, by all means do so. Go to court ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. I had a very good attorney.  But there was no way I could win.  Moreover, the shrink made a new recommendation each year for the whole coming year, so that cost another 500 each year.     The good thing is that it was all worth it in terms of the visitations being made more exact. (In our initial agreement, only th enumber of vistations was agreed to, not their length or their dates.) As my daughter has gotten older, she has begun to see for herself just how how unreasonable my ex is (I decided it was best to let her figure things out for herself rather than comment on them to her).  I remarried happily when my daughter was eight, and my wife and I have a two year old son, who my daughter loves. So things have worked out, especially for my daughter and me, but also for her and my new wife, and for my wife and me, because we don't have to communicate with my ex (except about pick ups and drop-offs). <br /> In some ways, the court system is a terrible racket.  The courts pass the buck to the shrinks, and the shrinks pass the buck right back to the court.  Everyone claims to be acting in the &quot;best interest of the child,&quot; but that is just empty rhetoric.  So stay out of court, if you can.  Present yourself as calm and reasonable if you do go to court, and do not correspond by email with your ex.  Also, make sure you research the shrinks.  Some of them are very conservative about visitations, others are much more reasonable. And use that &quot;best interest of the child&quot; rhetoric too.  Never talk about your own needs. They don't count.  Somehow, the idea that a child would benefit from having her father be financially stable and emotionally happy is not an idea that shrinks or the courts care apparently about.  Don't talk much about yourself unless asked.  Don't talk about your ex, and don't express any anger aout her.  Do talk about how much you love your daughter.  Cry. Get very emotional about ho wmuch you miss her, how you ar concerned about her. And if you do to court, get an agreement that spells everything out in advance--exact dates, etc, for as long in advance as you can.  That cuts down on any need to interact with ex.  And of course, never talk to your kids about any conflict over the visitations, even if your ex is, and don't talk to them about your ex either, even if she is the ex from hell.  Shield them from the conflict as much as you can.	2001-08-20

I took a course from Greenblatt when an undergard at U.C. Berekely, and he then directed my dissertation when I took my Ph.D. From U.C. Berkeley as well.  But I am not alone in regarding this book as a masterpiece, exteremely well-written adn insightful.  This book transformed not only the study of the Renaissance but of English literature in general.  Moreover, it has influenced historians such as Natalie Daivis and anthropologists.  After 17 years, Renaissance Self-Fashioning totally stands up.  The chapters on Wyatt, Tyndale, More (truly stellar), Spenser, and Shakespeare remained unsurpassed.  Readers may quibble, but though whose do have never written and will never write a book anywhere remotely near the excellence of Greeblatt's.  It is truly inspired and deservedly influential.	2001-02-24

It is little more than name dropping.  Johnson's thesis, emerging on p. 51, is that the Renaissance is about individual people (all men), and genius cannot be explained.  Gee, how enlightening.  Johnson also bizarrely includes medieval writers such as Dante and Chaucer in the Renaissance without explanation or justification.

Surpassing other  novelists who have written on Artemisia (Marine Bramly, Raouda Jamis)  Lapierre has turned up a lot of new facts by going back to the archives in  Rome and elsewhere ,and she has extensive notes for each chapter.  The  English translation is rather pedestrian and it also omits the lengthy  bibliography of primary and secondary sources in the original French  edition (available at amazon.fr). A note at the end of the book says they  are available on line, but I could not access the URL.  The Enlgish  translation also moves an aferword up and retitles it as a preface.  Also,  the English translation does not reproduce a series of paintings and  drawings in the notes of the French edition. (It does reproduce the plates  of several paintings in the middle, as they appear in the French edition.   So if you read French, I recommend French edition.  If you don't, this  English translation, though limited and incomplete, will still be welcome,  I'm sure.  Anna Banti's historically inaccurate novel, Artemisia, remains  the best novel on the Italian painter, in my view, as a work of literature,  but Lapierre has written the best novel that tries to be historically  acurate.	2000-09-02

This is a superbly written and researched account of Artemisia's Gentileschi's fascinating life and art.  While not at all hostile to feminist interpretations of the painter, chiefly Mary Garrard's, Bissell is  refreshingly skeptical and respectfully critical of many of their key  points.  Bissell is a more traditional art historian than I myself prefer,  but one can't find better art history than this.   Despite the high price,  I wholeheardtedly recommend this wonderful book to anyone interested in  Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings and as a feminsit icon.	2000-07-28

Apart from the fact thtthte style is unconvincing (no teenager I know could think like this), the plot resembles a Victorian softcore s and  m romance more than it does life in the 17th Ct.

She is happy to criticize the other women in the  household in order to get Vermeer's attention, as if she were saying,  &quot;Daddy, daddy, I can clean better than they can. Paint me (Guess what  else) me too!&quot;  The novel tells us next to nothing about Vermeer, his  painting, or the process of painting them.  Nor does it tell us anything  about being a model.

Quite different from the recent romantic Elizabeths in _Elizabeth_ (directed by Shekar Kapur) and _Shakespeare in Love_ (directed  by John Madden) ELizabeth I here appears in male drag throughout the play.  (The play is subtitled &quot;almost by chance a woman.&quot;)  Represented  as a grotesque figure, Elizabeth regularly goes out in London disguised as  a man in order to spy on her subjects.  Written in the early 1980s, the  play is a Jean Genetesque satire directed at Margaret Thatcher and her Tory  government. It is one of many instances wherein Elizabeth is represented in  drag.  In a 1980s management training video, John Cleese played a  Thatcherian Elizabeth hectoring a restive Privy Council. And the last  episode of The British sit-com _Blackadder II_ (Miranada Richardson of _The  Crying Game_ fame plays Quen Besie), a Prince Ludwig masquerades as  Elizabeth and kills the entire court.  More recently, Labame houston's  playlet _Elizabeth R_ also has Elizbeth in drag. And in Sally Potter's  _Orlando_, an ageing Elizabeth is played by the famous drag queen Quentin  Crisp.  Perhaps Fo's play is not so far away from _Elizabeth_ and  _Shakespeare in Love_ as one might think at first sight.  For though she  does not appear in these films in male drag, Elizabeth is the cause of drag  in others.  In _Elizabeth_, Anjou's marriage proposal is dismissed after  Elizabeth discovers him relaxing in bed dressed in women's clothes, and in  _Shakespeare in Love_, only Elizabeth can see through the corss-dressed  disguises of both Shakespeare and Viola.  Fo's _Elizabeth: Almost by Chance  a Woman_ deserves a wide readership.  I certainly hope to see in print  again soon.	2000-03-30
