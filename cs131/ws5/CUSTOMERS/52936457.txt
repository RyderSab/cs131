It's more than worth the money. I'll read this one cover to cover as soon as I can bestill my beating heart. I've checked out the write-ups for newer shows such as Buffy -- the authors have proven that they're still in top form. This edition even includes a trivia section, which I will attempt after reading the 1500 or so pages of television history. A must-have for anyone who watches TV.	2003-10-14
US	52936457	RWIIMGMQO3CE0	0770518214	265973400	Hurricane Hazel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A good book about a brutal storm	Betty Kennedy's tale of Hurricane Hazel provides good background for the storm, and  focuses mostly on how the storm affected Toronto, Canada. The photos are great, and many of the personal anecdotes are priceless.<br />Early in the book Kennedy mixes up the days of the week, and has October 15, 1954, as a Thursday, and later on as a Friday (it was Friday). Other than that, the book seems factually accurate.<br />Otherwise, this is a fine addition to any hurricane library, if you can find it.	2003-08-16
US	52936457	R1GCIJKIGVKC3Q	0739302043	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A good diversion for a long trip	It's easy to get lost in this story of religious artifacts and secret societies. The author stays away from romance, for the most part, which is a nice change. This is a classic thriller (minus the token romance) about a secret code related to Leonardo Da Vinci and a secret society that is hiding the Holy Grail, protecting it against the most conservative of Catholics. Ludicrous stuff, but entertaining.<br />The narrator does a fairly good job, but I have a few quibbles. First, the female voice he does is not convincing and may make you laugh out loud. His French accent is not bad, but it is cookie-cutter variety. His British accent needs some work, and his Scottish is, well, not Scottish. He paces the story well, however, and keeps us entertained.<br />In the abridging of the text, a few substantive errors have crept in. For one, the heroine lets slip to another character that her grandfather was involved in the secret society, but later on when she mentions it a second time to the same character he reacts with great surprise.<br />The Da Vinci Code would likely make for a better read than a listen, but it will help pass the hours on the interestate.	2003-08-16

Thompson's depictions of the world seen through an ether cloth are absurd, sometimes frightening. I'm still thinking about his hallucination of his dead grandmother crawling up his leg with a knife between her teeth. Also of negotiating a deal to buy an ape from its handler at a casino, and of a terrifying polar bear exchange high above Circus Circus. Whoa.<br />I don't know enough about this book (I was in diapers when it first came out) and will now read more about Thompson and the school of Gonzo journalism. I wonder about the accuracy of Thompson's power of recollection. How could he possibly remember and render his hallucinations so clearly? Surely, he must have taken some license. Otherwise his ramblings would not seem so coherent, so reflective, so funny.<br />I would have given this book five stars, but it started to fall apart somewhere in the middle, probably about where the second of the original Rolling Stone articles begins. In the second half Thompson leaves out much of the action and gives us a combination of highlights and longer essays and transcriptions. Each piece probably worked completely as a magazine article, but as a book, not quite. Still, this is probably the funniest book I've ever read. I'm just not sure what it all means, or what I'm supposed to take away from it. Maybe I'll find out the next time I'm looking down the neck of a 40 of tequila.	2003-07-22

Fatsis lives the world of the Scrabble elite while taking us on his own journey to Scrabble greatness. For two years Fatsis turned tiles, travelling around the country and across the world to the Nationals. People who play this game for a living are very weird and seem to have great trouble fitting in anywhere but in this game world, but even among other word freaks they still maintain a kind of distance.<br />I would have loved this book a lot more if I enjoyed the writing, which I mostly didn't. I simply don't like Fatsis's style. His tone is uneven, he seems to write for teenagers, and the book is not well organized or conceived. But he's a remarkable researcher and is not afraid to tell it like it is, so I admire him for that.<br />Reading this book sent me back to my own Scrabble board, which had been gathering dust for some time. Thank you, Mr. Fatsis, for that. Until the obsession again dies down, the words will swirl in my head, and I'll be daydreaming, looking for tags and triple-triples.	2003-07-11

Still, I found THE HORNED MAN a haunting work of literature. It reminds me greatly of FRANKENSTEIN as a study of the Calvinistic nature of humans. Duplicity lurks everywhere in this bizarre tale. I won't say anything else or it might alter your reading experience. I will say that this book will stay with you; Lasdun's triggers will spring on you in moments of quiet reflection.	2003-06-10

He drinks too much, sleeps around with a lot of women, lies his way into bed. Then he takes a teaching post at a remote Greek island, where he gets an inordinate amount of free time. And he makes a friend of the eccentric billionaire living on the other side of the island, and the sweet nymphettes who live there as well.<br />But after a while it gets so boring. After about page 300 you'll do one of three things: stay up all night reading it because you love it, stay up all night to finish the thing so you can say you read it, or you'll chuck the book into the recycling bin. Conchis says in the book something to the effect that he gave up reading fiction because he found in 500-odd pages only a dozen half-truths. He couldn't have been more right about The Magus. Fowles makes some startling observations, then pounds them repeatedly into our skulls until we're more zombielike than Nick the Clueless.<br />I'm glad I read this so that I can tell my enemies to read it so they'll never talk to me again.	2003-06-04

I never realized before the angst that haunts war photographers, the guilt that plagues them when they file their photos and stories with their editors. They make money on other people's suffering, yet their photos often help the people who suffer by informing the world of what's going on. But for the most part they can't help the one person they've captured so brilliantly in one frozen moment in time, and because of that many can't sleep at night. They make the world a better, safer place, and pay for it with damaged psyches.	2003-05-30

The Japanese in World War II took a step back as a civilized nation when they committed atrocities against British, American, Canadian, and Australian POWs, as well as countless Filipino, Chinese, and other civilians and soldiers. On nearly every page of this book you'll read of the horrific treatment the POWs underwent: beheadings, medical experiments, forced labour, disease. Also you'll find out about what man will do to man in the confines of a prison camp: stealing, bribing, gambling with others' lives.<br />I thought what I'd find most interesting in this book would be what happened to the POWs after the war, when they reintegrated into society, and I did find the info interesting. But what I found most interesting, astounding in fact, was the way the American government treated its own soldiers after they came home. Not only were the Japanese who conducted medical experiments on soldiers not tried as war criminals, they bought their lives, their freedom, by selling the results of their \\"tests\\" to the American government. I can understand, in a way, why the government did this, as they were entering the Cold War and the war in Korea (a difficult act of a desperate government) but why didn't they provide the victims with cash or property in exchange for what they suffered? The POWs very nearly paid for their time in the camps with their lives. Surely they deserved more on return than a lack of understanding and one new set of clean clothes.	2003-05-20

The updated, irritating photo of Andrew Vachss with the eyepatch on the backcover should have helped me figure out that this is a new book. The Getaway Man is Vachss' take on the classic story of a young hood with a lot of character climbing the criminal ranks. I love the cover. It's brilliant, harkening back to the '40s and '50s, when these novels were at their peak.<br />Vachss tries to imitate the feel of the genre, but has written a book without soul. Those books are charming because they were written that way instinctively; Vachss plays copycat. I admire that Vachss has placed his timeless character in the modern age instead of setting this as a period piece, but in doing so he falls short. His naive getaway man, though having spent many years of his life in jail, is unconvincing. His character has never used a VCR or rented a tape. All he knows are cars and driving. Come on.<br />Still, I enjoyed this short read, which you can finish in a week of commuting. But it ain't Raymond Chandler. Then again, nothing is.	2003-03-26
US	52936457	R2WIJZ98F63K8V	0451204476	476746763	Ordeal by Sea: The Tragedy of the U.S.S. Indianapolis	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A decent retelling of a horrific tale	Ordeal by Sea does not feature great writing -- the character portrayals are weak, the suspense is almost non-existent, the narrative rambles. What this book does have in its favor is that it was written twenty years after the sinking of the Indianapolis, while the event was still relatively sharp in the public's mind, and in the survivors' minds as well.<br />As I've mentioned, the dramatic aspects of this book are weak. These guys were in the Pacific five days with sharks pulling them under the water, and Helms makes it seem almost like a swim meet. Helm was not a great writer, but he does tell this horrifying story reasonably well: the Indianapolis delivers materials for one of the bombs to fall on Japan in the summer of 1945, the ship is sunk by a rogue Japanese sub, the survivors float for five days in shark-infested waters, some injured in the sinking, their bones pushing through flesh, the unfair court-martialing of McVay, the ship's captain. This is one of the best stories of surviving the worst conditions out there.<br />One caveat: The publisher does not present this as a classic, as an older book brought out again. You find that out in the new introduction. I thought that this was a brand new book when I purchased it. That dings the book's rating.<br />Truly a remarkable story, however.	2003-03-17

It should be sold dog-eared with the cover torn and with pages falling out. After all, that will be the condition of your copy after you've read it and reread it and reread it again. Chandler's startling first novel is a lot of fun. His innovative style rings true today, never to be matched. Philip Marlowe, tough, unrepentant, loyal, yet acting above the law, is a remarkable character. His encounters with crime figures and loose ladies stand the test of time.	2003-03-04
US	52936457	R2UQ6SJJGJWT12	0333120698	227071057	The Weekend Man	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Often funny, dreary	The Weekend Man, Richard Wright's novel of a sales representative in an educational publishing house wading through life, is often hailed as a classic. I disagree, not because this isn't a good book -- it is -- but it lacks something, or perhaps it has too much of other things -- melancholy, perhaps immobility. The book is humorous, as Wright offsets incongruent elements; his timing is excellent. But there is something that drags you down about this novel. You want Wes Wakeham to wake up, to throw off his dreary everyman appearance and at the very least disagree with someone. But that's the whole point, I know, that he doesn't. Well, the device works -- Wes grinds you down. You want success for him that he doesn't want for himself. But success finds Wakeham whether he wants it to or not, with women, his job, his son.<br />The setting, Toronto about 1970, is sweet, almost quaint. The world was much quieter before the advent of 24-hour news services and the Internet, as Wright aptly shows. (The novel was first published in 1970, so it is a novel of the times, not a period piece.) The sexual and office politics are on the money. The characters are believable. They are everyone we know.<br />A fine novel, but not a masterpiece, not the great Canadian novel. A good read, all the same.	2003-01-28

It's a good book -- it's solid, but not spectacular. Tilman is a fine character, a young man who knows from a very young age that his role is not to live in one place, but to roam. His sister Klara absorbs the family's obsession with carving in his absence. She falls for the silent Irishman, Eamon, and watches him go off to war.<br />Eventually a few of these characters make their way to Vimy to participate in the completion of the memorial -- an insufferable pilgrimage that to me does not work at all. I understand that Vimy is the crescendo of the novel, but to me it's an unlikely and uninteresting finale.	2003-01-24

In the Border Trilogy, McCarthy is all about nuanced characters. All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain are modern cowboy stories: raw, vivid, visceral, without gratuitous bloodletting.<br />Blood Meridian, while a fascinating book, betrays the true quality of McCarthy's inspired prose. He pours so much blood on his characters, while smashing their heads in and killing babies and drowning puppies etc., that we are quickly desensitized and expect any of the characters to die soon enough, or be maimed, or slaughter a family of pilgrims, and are almost happy when they do so. The world that McCarthy describes is horrid, awful, a place no one would ever want to go. The chances of survival slim.<br />But still, there's something appealing about the Kid, the teenage Tennessean who roams the west, often with the Judge, in my eyes a nod to Conrad's madman in Heart of Darkness, or Apocalypse Now for the modern generation. The Kid comes from a bad family, not Jerry Springer bad, but better-get-out-before-you're-killed bad. He rides through the west with the Judge, a sinister character, the devil on earth. The Judge's army needs him to survive, but why they want to live in that existence is anyone's guess.<br />The ending of Blood Meridian is as fine and as frightening as you'll find in literature. Stephen King, not even close. A truly chilling book.	2003-01-10

I can't fault his faulty characters, either, or the pedantic explanations of legal procedures. I was, however, disappointed by the ending, which might have been a twist when this book first came out 15 years ago, but not now. Now, we've seen far too many episodes of Law &amp; Order to ever be surprised by this kind of conclusion. We know the ins and outs of the courtroom, at least as they are portrayed in the media. We know what fibre analysis is, about fingerprints, alibis, etc. Turow explains these things to us throughout.<br />Turows characters are weak as well. His blacks are either ghetto thugs or Uncle Toms who do their race justice. The black judge speaks in ebonics, his black punks talk like Tupac. He even uses the word &quot;negro.&quot; His slimebags are short, fat, dumpy, Italians or other ethnics. The women are receptacles for male lust, or hollow housewives or grannies wearing round glasses. Hardly a sampling of American society.<br />I did enjoy this book, however faulty its sociological representation of our culture. It's far better written than most thrillers that now line the bestseller shelves.	2003-01-09

Kaiser appears to have been no help whatsoever in penning this disaster.) The celebs never seem to realize that what we find interesting about them is what they're best-known for. In this case, Farr is best-known for M*A*S*H, yet he barely even touches on the show until two-thirds of the way through the book, then he charges ahead without giving us much insight into the show, the actors, or the creators, then rambles on about his life after M*A*S*H (without touching upon the sequel to his hit show, AfterM*A*S*H).<br />Jamie Farr cannot write, which is not his fault, he's a comedian, not a book writer. The publisher should have stepped in and at least had the thing PROOFREAD! Missing periods and commas throughout, typos rampant. The writing is atrocious. No pacing whatsoever. No transitions between paragraphs. And not enough M*A*S*H. The only celeb memoir worse than this one is Carroll O'Connor's I THINK I'M OUTTA HERE. It makes me cry to think that even one tree was killed to print that insult to writing.<br />I would have given the book one star, yet I like Farr and loved the show, so I added a star to spare his rating.	2002-09-28

ALL THE PRETTY HORSES and THE CROSSING feature John Grady Cole and Billy Parham, respectively, two young bucks full of wisdom, the last cowboys on the frontier of the latter half of the twentieth century. The two meet in CITIES OF THE PLAIN, with Parham twenty years Cole's senior. They appear as the same character, really, at different stages of a cowboy's life. Cole gets mixed up with a Mexican prostitute, again giving his all for the love of a young woman. Parham, who never seemed to have much time for women, watches Cole self-destruct, much as his brother, Boyd, had in THE CROSSING. McCarthy obviously loves John Grady Cole, this wise-before-his-years teen who can beat anyone at chess and can tell a horse's worth from his gait. I love Cole, and all of McCarthy's creations, too. THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN doesn't quite work, however. In many ways, it's predictable. The book is driven by dialogue, whereas in the previous two books in the Border Trilogy dialogue was sparse, the few words all McCarthy needed to help us understand. If you're paying attention, you should be able to figure out the direction of Cole's affair long before it reaches its crescendo.<br />I would have given this book five full stars, except that it isn't as good as the previous two, which I've given five stars, and for the strange epilogue, which I tried to read three times, then gave up and slammed the book shut. A weak, weak ending to a glorious trilogy.	2002-09-28

Faulkner's SANCTUARY must have been mind-blowing to the genteel masses. They were reading material that they still don't show on network television today, in an age where such things are so commonly discussed in the media that we hardly look sideways at it. This book must have arrived like an explosion, shaking the sensibilities of readers everywhere, daring booksellers to put it on their shelves.<br />SANCTUARY is not an easy book. You'll find yourself, if you're like me, rereading passages to understand exactly what's going on. The characters, though precisely described, can be difficult to picture in your mind, especially as we move further away from the Jazz Age, with its unusual expressions, costume, and mores. Imagine Tennessee and Mississippi when cars were relatively new to the roads, when the various social strata -- some wearing suits, some overalls -- began mixing together more easily. Imagine being a teenage girl acting as a woman trapped in a moonshiner's shack, far away from the protection of her home, encountering men like creatures in a horrific play who drink liquor and watch her lie under the covers, her only protector passed out beside her.<br />Faulkner's reintroduced introduction is a godsend that will help you decipher the book somewhat. The editor's notes at the end of the book will help you understand much of the jargon and the motivation of the characters.<br />A good read in any age.	2002-09-13

The Crossing may also refer to metaphorical journeys, such as from boyhood to manhood, from tame to wild, wild to tame. I won't say anything else and ruin the story, as other reviewers are wont to do.<br />A thoroughly engaging and gripping book. At times McCarthy has Billy meet up with strangers who opine for pages on end about the mysteries of life. These intermissions I find excessive and unnecessary to the story, and I almost didn't make it past the first one, though I'm glad I did. By the end of The Crossing your brain will be full of the book, images of horses and guns and senoritas and the Mexican countryside implanted in your head, ideas of mortality, friendship, honor, and duty stuck in your imagination for days.<br />A few notes to the other reviewers: McCarthy has constructed the Spanish dialogue so that we can figure out what people are saying in context. All you have to do is pay attention. Also, if you aren't used to the lack of punctuation by the third page you might as well pick up the classic comics edition instead. The spare dialogue without quotations draw us into the spare, harsh scenery of New Mexico and Mexico.<br />On to The Cities of the Plain!	2002-09-03

Wilson skins musicians, esp. Michael Jackson, as well as fashion models, wannabe film actors, authors, and the theater in her inimitable caustic tone.<br />At times, Wilson is brilliant in carving new holes in the already-thin fabric of celebrity. Later in the book, however, you can tell that she and her editor have sewn together her columns from salon.com, which, though wonderful as columns, do not come together to form a cohesive argument. In a way, Wilson has become a victim of her own fame, toddling out used commentary and selling it as new, like a remake of a Hollywood favorite, starring Peter Scolari and Molly Ringwald.<br />This book is mostly enjoyable, however.

For these top-end people to happen to come together to form this hunt club, for the homeless to pull together to allow hunting of their own, for the resourceless Jeff Converse to find his way through the maze of tunnels that even the hunters with their infrared goggles find nearly impassable, and for his family to pretend to be homeless and to walk the subway tunnels to find him . . . arrgh!	2002-08-14

Narayan's memoir gives us a glimpse into the uncomplicated life of a simple man who became one of the 20th century's literary giants. On par with Graham Greene, Narayan shared in his literature the world of Malgudi, a busy place peopled with hilarious characters and a clear reflection of the politics of a small Indian city. Narayan's India is real, bereft of the imperial feel of Kipling's version of a few decades earlier. In Malgudi, everyone knows each other, and the circle of life revolves around a little print shop, fashioned after the shop Narayan would visit when creating his local arts paper as a young man.<br />MY DAYS is a fascinating look into Narayan's psyche, though it does drag at times. Narayan clearly writes better make-believe than real life, but this book is still a treat.	2002-08-13

Each writes about life in a small town: the personal relationships, the petty politics, the damaged families hiding behind vinyl siding. I have yet to finish a novel by either, however. In EMPIRE FALLS, Russo takes 100 pages to set the scene and introduce us to his characters' histories. Ford does the same in THE SPORTWRITER, a melancholy work about one man rebuilding his life after the death of his son and the break-up of his marriage. This is a sad book that I'm sure becomes less sad over the course of the long weekend of the book's many pages, but after the first day I couldn't stand it anymore. These books lend themselves better to film: see NOBODY'S FOOL, based on the Russo novel of the same title -- a brilliant film, one of the best I've ever seen. The film works because the scenery and character description are summed up in one panoramic shot, and the film cuts to the personal relationships and what happens now, not what happened then.<br />I had hoped to enjoy Ford's fiction, but I was disappointed. I might catch up to Ford's protagonist in INDEPENDENCE DAY, but I don't know if I feel like feeling that sad again for a while.	2002-08-13

Her sultry sister, Cecilia, and the charwoman's son, Robbie Turner, also live on the expansive grounds of the rural estate outside of London. What was a dinner party planned on a gloomy day becomes the turning point of the novel -- perhaps. It is difficult at times to figure out what's real and what isn't. McEwan deftly turns us from the realistic to the chaotic to the unreal, and by the end of the book, which will keep you up several nights in a row absorbing the beautiful words, you aren't sure what's happened, and might believe, as others do, that McEwan has compromised the story with the ending, hamstrung a 400+ page novel with the strange few final pages. I am not a fan of the ending, but the second and third parts of this book more than make up for that. You'll find some of the best wartime narrative in fiction in these pages.<br />A brilliant work, truly, one of the best novels I've read in years.	2002-08-12

He describes scenery, women, and horses through the eyes of grizzled young riders in the Texas dust. His landscapes are remarkable -- dry, dusty, steaming, other times lush, but always hot. His characters are truly wonderful, 1950s cowpokes and members of the Mexican aristocracy lost in time, not yet used to the world of the automobile, unaffected by the Baby Boom and the economic surge post-WWII.<br />John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old horse handler on the run from his mother's affairs and his father's illness, is what we all want to be: noble, wise, rugged. His pal Rawlins is a hilarious sidekick, though more than that. He lacks Cole's early wisdom, but enjoys life more and makes fateful decisions on instinct alone. Cole's romance with the beautiful Alejandra is masterfully handled, though the awful cover of this movie tie-in would tell you otherwise.<br />Find your favorite chair, turn off the phone, and curl up with this gem.	2002-08-12

Books	2	1	1	N	N	Monotonous	The premise of this book is fascinating: what happens to a man when he does nothing but watch television over a two-week period? I expected a fun narrative about how the author spun out, going deeper and deeper into his TV hell. Instead, the author gives a play-by-play, often at 10-minute intervals, of what he watched and what he thought of the show of the moment, which takes us inside his world but does not comment on it. The book could have been titled &quot;Reports from the TV Front: An Examination of What's on TV at This Very Moment.&quot; This book would have been far better if Brownstein had sat back after compiling his diary and had written a more general description of what happened to him on his journey, rather than what was on the tube (because who really cares?). The diary entries would have worked best as add-on elements rather than as the core of the narrative.	2002-02-19

Much of the book is hilarious, especially the list of basic TV plots and the collective wisdom of sitcoms. I especially loved the examination of the amnesia plot in comedies and the proliferation of the \\"hit on the head\\" trigger and \\"hit on the head again\\" cure.<br />The list of 100 top sitcom episodes is interesting, but, like any list, is controversial (at least to classic TV types). Why the Leave it to Beaver episode with Captain Jack, when the boys take home a baby alligator, instead of the one where Beaver becomes trapped in a giant teacup? Why the episode of Happy Days when Richie fights back against bullies instead of the famous \\"jump the shark\\" episode, or the one where Richie returns to the show for the first time in years?<br />The thinly veiled ads for TV Land -- its shows, specials, books -- seems tongue in cheek, but irritates as well. I flipped past those sections quickly. Some of the lists of top shows are short, and are conspicuously filled with shows that TV Land currently airs.<br />A nice addition, overall, to your TV book library, but not the \\"classic compendium\\" it's purported to be.	2002-02-12

As in Saramago's Blindness, we're never sure where the novel takes place, or even exactly when (though we can guess it's modern-day Portugal). Without the mention of cars and appliances, for example, we would never even know that All the Names takes place within the last century. Saramago's works are timeless, placeless, faceless. All the Names, at times, is also paceless.<br />I love Saramago's elliptical style, but this book never really gets rolling. Saramago sacrifices plot for the pure beauty of his writing and the expression of his timeless message of our collective humanity, but after 50 pages you'll find yourself begging for story. The novel eventually hits a bit of a groove, but too late to save it. Throw in some curious Christ imagery and the fruitlessness of Jose's efforts and you'll steam through the last few pages with great eagerness to slam it shut.<br />As in Blindness, only one character get a name -- Senhor Jose. He represents the great majority, many of whom live and die in pointless obscurity in the files of the Central Registry. Day after day, Senhor Jose files index cards, takes in new information, stacks papers. He follows the protocol that the rest of the Registry follows, including waiting in line at the door to enter in order and speaking only when spoken to. These are data soldiers who retreat only at the end of the day.<br />Senhor Jose's only life outside the Registry is in examining the lives of celebrities. He begins to hoard the index cards of politicians, actors, and athletes. One day, Senhor Jose finds the card of a common woman and decides to follow any lead he can to track her down. He finds a life not exciting but normal; nevertheless his obsession for the woman grows. His quest takes him into the woman's private world and begins to tear Senhor Jose's life apart. By the end of All the Names, Senhor Jose is changed, his view of all the names in the Central Registry altered forever.<br />All the Names is a neat little book at times, but dreadfully slow at others. Blindness is far superior and covers much of the same territory. Read it first.	2002-02-11

Scott Berg: Author of Genius	Max Perkins: Editor of Genius is one of the best non-fiction titles I've read in a long time, and will likely be one of the best books I'll ever read. Berg (with the help of his own editor) truly is a genius: he pulls us directly into the story, introducing us to Scribner's Max Perkins at the zenith of his editorial career, then plunges us into his first acquisition -- F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned -- before taking us, methodically, through Perkins's life. An intrepid biographer, Berg tells us only what we need to know about Perkins's early life, getting to the good stuff: his discovery of Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe and his work with Ernest Hemingway. We also find out about Perkins's work with other remarkable authors, including Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (The Yearling), S.S. Van Dine (the Philo Vance mysteries), and Arthur Train, creator of the mythical DA Ephraim Tutt. I laughed out loud at the story about how many believed that Tutt existed after the publication of his \\"autobiograhpy,\\" complete with photos.<br />We learn of Perkins's patient relationship with the frustrating Thomas Wolfe, a mammoth talent and physical specimen who could not contain his own enthusiasm. Berg suggests that, as Perkins discovered, Wolfe wasn't writing \\"books,\\" he was writing one book, which would have encompassed thousands of pages if he had not died early -- a profound insight into the heart and soul of a dynamic author.<br />We learn much of Papa Hemingway as well, including some insights into the macho author's home life. Elements of Hemingway's unpublished fiction suggest that the bullfighting fan, fisherman, and big game hunter might have enjoyed switching gender roles in bed with one of his wives.<br />Fitzgerald comes off as one who excelled in being pathetic, a man who suffered desperately with his wife, Zelda, alcohol, and simply living large. Berg gives us a tender portrait of Perkins's greatest find.<br />As with all excellent biographies, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius examines only what made Perkins who he was: the editor of the twentieth century. Perkins preferred to sit on the sidelines, championing his authors. Often, he sits on the sidelines in this book as well, but this only makes sense: he was famous for his work with his more famous authors. It wasn't Max, it was his interaction with these great authors that made him all great.<br />As some reviewers have pointed out, Max would have enjoyed thsi book.	2002-01-21

But I do not like Carroll O'Connor. I THINK I'M OUTTA HERE is a convoluted, self-centered work showing O'Connor to have been a man oblivious to the world around him. This book is dreadful. His belligerence likely sent his editor into hiding, for what else could explain why O'Connor was allowed his digressions into Irish history and his ridiculous footnotes about nothing? At one point, he tells of the &quot;Divil&quot; on his shoulder (with a footnote explaining how the &quot;Divil&quot; is another form of the &quot;Devil&quot;) who speaks with an Irish accent, and how this Divil helped steer him through life.<br />I'm sure that O'Connor worked very hard to get where he did, to get the roles he did. But he makes it seem as if he deserved everything: he was born to his roles, and everyone in Hollywood thought so, too. I'd admire the man more if he told us how hard he did work to become a star. I'd enjoy hearing more about his friends in entertainment, and what he thought of working with Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers.<br />O'Connor follows the path of others who are known for doing one great thing and then write about it: he skirts around his most important accomplishment. He tells us how brilliant he was when he recreated Norman Lear's Archie Bunker, about how great Jean Stapleton was as Edith (no argument there), but then says something like &quot;Those of you looking for a rehashing of what happened during the production of that show won't find it here,&quot; then jumps to his life post-cancellation of the show. Nothing new here.<br />The final chapter of this book is pitiful, but also made me pity Carroll O'Connor, which I'm sure would have angered the man greatly. His son, Hugh, succumbed to his drug habit, committing suicide after O'Connor attempted numerous interventions with his family at his side. It wasn't enough. Only in this final chapter do we see O'Connor as just another person -- vulnerable, powerless to control the lives of others -- a real man. It's sad that he could not have broken free of the reins of pretentiousness and told us his whole story with such emotion.<br />If you're a fan of All in the Family, steer clear. If you're a fan of Carroll O'Connor, rent some of his movies, watch episodes of All in the Family and In the Heat of the Night, then turn off your TV. This book does him no justice.	2002-01-11

Rob, anti-hero, slacker, hero to his fellow thirty-somethings, lives what he does, listening to music. He and his two part-time full-time co-workers don't really work, they sit around talking about music, listing their favorite and most-hated songs. After work, Rob whines about Laura, who has left him for the guy upstairs, and hooks up with other women while he waits for her to come to her senses.<br />Rob is at his best as the unrepentant male. His world circles around him, as our worlds circle around us. He's selfish and small: a real guy. He continually lists his life's efforts and failures, categorizing them like records in his collection. Shades of his honorable self shine through. I kept wanting to tell him to keep his head down, he'll get through it, but eventually he falls into the maw of predictability and is on his way to a future of diaper bags and car pools.<br />The first two-thirds of HIGH FIDELITY are an anthem for anyone born in the sixties. The last third, anathema to anyone who hoped for something different.	2001-12-24

Much of this book is entertaining: meeting up with Harvey's various lady friends, visiting the bizarre William S. Burroughs months before his death, eating in truck stops, Paterniti rambling to strangers having Einstein's brain in the back of his Buick Skylark.<br />DRIVING MR. ALBERT is no ON THE ROAD, however. This book is a long-winded magazine article, stuffed with sidetrips and a light biography of Albert Einstein. Paterniti never truly has a meeting of minds with Harvey; he does not develop a friendship or any kind of trust. Paterniti is merely the driver, Harvey a spectacularly unusual character along for the ride.<br />Paterniti thanks a friend in his acknowledgments for pulling him back from precipices of metaphor, though it's obvious the friend didn't pull at him enough -- Paterniti still goes over the edge a few times, sprinkling the text with phrases such as &quot;big as the cosmos&quot; and &quot;we drove down the highway like neurons racing through the brain.&quot;<br />Pacing is a problem as well. The backstory of Einstein's life is not well integrated into the book, taking us on day trips to nowhere. Paterniti has obviously researched this book well, but has merely inserted others' paraphrased words wholesale.<br />I love road trips, especially with cerebral passengers, but I was ready to bail on this one somewhere between Lawrence, Kansas, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.	2001-11-23

Most of the time, however, it's quite boring. Crace is obviously a gifted writer, but in this tale of death and life his microscope is too finely tuned, giving us minute details of dull lives. I found neither of the protagonists, Celice and Joseph, engaging, and their daughter, Syl, I found unlikely -- unrepentant, pessimistic, yet ultimately frail and hopeless. I'll still read Mr. Crace's QUARANTINE without prejudice, however. Everyone deserves a second chance.	2001-11-23

I like the premise -- two kids writing their own comic books, their principal turning into an underwear-clad superhero -- but what bothers me is that in the kids' comic strips, the author has purposely misspelled dozens of words, as if ignorant children have written the captions. For the adults this is cute, but for the children who read these cartoons over and over again these misspellings will become fatally etched in their memories.

Maas has an easy style and paces the story well. Other reviewers have complained about how Maas jumps around, leaving us hanging as the Squalus sits dead at the bottom of the ocean to tell us about Swede Momsen, the legendary submariner, or to take us to the families of the not-so-doomed sailors below. I call this good storytelling.<br />Swede Momsen will live long in your memories. A true hero, Momsen invented many devices that have saved thousands of lives and have allowed us to explore deeper into the oceans. He was a true visionary. Maas tells us much about his good friend. We're lucky Maas found this lost story before we lost Momsen. Sadly, we recently lost Peter Maas as well.<br />I would have given this book five stars but for the lack of photos, maps, and diagrams -- a tremendous shame, as other reviewers have noted. Why not include photos if they're available, especially of Momsen, the crew of the Squalus, and the other subs and ships mentioned in the book? Without a diagram of the sub, I had trouble visualizing just where the crew members were at various times or how the rescue-ship Falcon hooked into the sub to raise it. And without a map (and being too lazy to reach for my atlas) I couldn't quite picture where the drama took place.<br />A terrific book marred by lack of supporting resources.	2001-11-17

I have always had a fascination with how people begin anything, but especially how women or men cross the line (I don't mean that negatively) and become prostitutes. What this book is, however, is half stories from women in the industry and half academic writings on the plight of prostitutes. Not what I wanted, but still pretty good.<br />The stories, from street prostitutes, call girls, massage parlor workers, and strippers are often quite touching. The women, many of whom are lesbian, I've discovered in this book, choose to become prostitutes, prostitution doesn't choose them. They profess to either enjoy their job or to suffer through it not unlike clockwatchers do. Still, I can't help but read pain between the lines in these women's stories. These women are used -- well used, poorly used -- for others' whims. All of us prostitute ourselves to some end, but these women live short careers. To them, there is no glass ceiling, only plaster and dim lights in dingy rooms.<br />The academic essays supply some fascinating insights into how prostitution started. The authors offer facts about who prostitutes are, where they live, how the law applies to them, and how prostitutes are grouping together for safety and power.<br />This book, an amalgam or heartbreaking stories and academic consideration, is really a college-level reader, but for those of us who didn't study this stuff at school or are simply interested in the way prostitutes live, it still makes for interesting reading.	2001-10-28
US	52936457	RUV05QQ6LQZJ0	0689844085	614019833	Robinson Crusoe	Books	4	8	9	N	N	The original Survivor	Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe never lived with a number of other people on his deserted island, competing for food and immunity icons every week, a television camera constantly in his face. Crusoe lived his solitary life not for the entertainment of others, but to suffer the plight of the lonely.<br />Ignoring the advice of his wise father, who begged him to choose an honest life close to home, Crusoe heads to sea and almost dies three times before ending up on his deserted isle. He chooses a life of a plantation owner, hiring slaves to do much of his work. He chooses to ignore the teachings of God, and puts himself at the top of his own kingdom. On a journey to collect slaves to increase productivity on his plantation, his ship wrecks on the rocks of an island. All are lost but him. He saves some provisions from his ship, but has to work the land on his own to survive nearly three decades in solitude. It isn't until one lucky Friday that Crusoe's isolation ends and his purgatory is over.<br />Defoe's book is really a treatise on humility, of suffering for the sake of one's soul and finding one's place in the world. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Crusoe, alone for 400 pages, keeps our attention to the end.<br />This is a children's edition, put out by Simon and Schuster's Aladdin Paperbacks. What makes this a children's addition is the foreword by Avi, a children's author, and the reading guide at the end worded for children.<br />But there's little, really, to distinguish this edition from others. As a book for children, Robinson Crusoe needs more than a few simplistic questions and a wispy introduction. There is much in this book from another age that parents and children will want to discuss: racism, slavery, misuse of your fellow man, cannibalism, butchery. Defoe's readers believed that cannibals inhabited many of the unchartered islands of the southern hemisphere, and the children of today, though not stupid, will need guidance to disavow them of this same incorrectthought and others. We should not censor this book -- it's as much historical document as it is literature -- but parents should be aware of what their children are reading, read it with them, and help them understand the world as it was (and wasn't) 300 years ago.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars (Robinson Crusoe alone deserves 5 stars) except for the mistakes on the back cover --Unabridged spelled &quot;Unabrdiged&quot; -- and in Avi's foreword -- foreword spelled &quot;foreward,&quot; comma splices, and a reference to Crusoe's 24 years on the island (he was on the island 28 years!). Errors creep into most books, but in a children's book a publisher should take more care to ensure that the information is accurate.<br />This is a beautiful edition, marred by errors and lacking in supporting reading. Any other edition would suffice.	2001-10-28

To us, hard reality is forgetting to bring bottled water on a camping trip, or burning a souffle, or being stuck in traffic when picking up our kids. To Rawicz and his fellow escapees from a labor camp, hard reality included walking through driving snow wearing little more than sacks, walking through a desert for days on end without water or food, chasing snakes for food, climbing the Himilayas without any equipment or guides, drinking polluted water, and living in your own filth in a chimney-sized cell for a year. Rawicz's story is magical for the armchair adventurer, though it must have been unbearably brutal for those who lived it.<br />Ghostwritten by a British journalist, THE LONG WALK at times reads as if an Englishman experienced the journey, though this only adds to its charm.<br />I commend the Lyons Press for reviving this book, which I would not otherwise have found. Check out the other titles they've rereleased, especially David Howarth's THE SLEDGE PATROL, WE DIE ALONE, and THE SHETLAND BUS.	2001-09-24

The book is so packed with information it's hard to access. The type is extremely small, and the design so busy it almost makes you not want to read it.<br />The questions are hard, really hard in fact. I don't think they're even that interesting. It's not a test of sports knowledge to know on what day a sports event happened, or what various teams' won-lost records were.

What Ted Conover has uncovered, as other authors about prisons have -- especially Pete Earley -- is that prison life is extremely dull (not that I've experienced it), which explains why Newjack is only peppered with interesting incidents instead of being an action-packed saga of life in prison.<br />The most fascinating points of this book are Conover's dialogues with pseudointellectual lifers about the nature of imprisonment. One con says, aptly, that we should stop planning ahead to build prisons for tomorrow's children, instead spending that money on social programs to prevent those children from going to prison in the first place. Idealistic, yes, but still pertinent, especially coming from a con. As he says, it's too late for him, but save the children.<br />Conover's plan, to live and work as a correction officer for a year then to quit to write about it, was slightly flawed, I think. Conover knows there's an escape for him, so he becomes ever more upbeat as his last few days approach. If he knew he was in for the long term, I doubt he'd be so upbeat. I would think his attitude would differ from that of most correction officers. In that aspect, I'd rather read a book from the point of view of a lifelong guard, or, even better, from a literate prisoner.<br />The historical aspects of this book, especially the minihistory of the electric chair and corporal punishment, are excellent, though slightly out of place. Still, I enjoyed the history as an aside.<br />All around a solid read. Check out Pete Earley's The Hot House for another insider's (yet still an outsider's) viewpoint of life in prison (this time Leavenworth).	2001-09-10

Fans of Law and Order will find this book a valuable guide; the episode section of this book is great, listing the main stars, guest stars, crew, and production staff for each show.<br />The narrative about the concept of the show -- how it came into being, who did what, etc. -- is lacking, however. The authors have chosen a thematic approach, short chapters on the main stars, guest stars, the executive producers, the theme song. The chapters are far too short. The interviews with cast are good, but the narrative holding it all together is kind of dull.<BR>You'll find some great revelations in this book, especially about how the cast members, past and present, think about each other, but really you'll flip past most of that stuff to get to the episode guide.<br />The book is now sorely out of date, missing more than two seasons of new episodes. I suggest you wait for an update.	2001-09-10

What We Call Ourselves and Why It Matters -- this subtitle promises much, but, unfortunately, the authors haven't delivered on it. A better subtitle for The Language of Names would be Dozens of Neat Anecdotes About Names in Thematic Form But Without a Common Thread. There's no premise to this book, just thematic chapters that discuss maiden names, sports team names, etc. That doesn't mean that this isn't an interesting book. At times, The Language of Names is really quite interesting, but this book isn't what the package claims it is.<br />I recommend this book as a fun exercise in why we name ourselves what we do, not as a serious effort to uncover why it matters.<br />One other point: the chapter on maiden names attacks at length the tradition of the woman taking the man's name, which is really out of context with the rest of the book. A history of why women take men's names and what the other options are would fascinate. Attacking men and belittling what others choose to do, at least in this context, does not.	2001-08-22

I read his The Sledge Patrol, which is a terrific story in itself, and bought 1066: The Year of the Conquest soon after. Howarth brings us what we might have learned in school but have long since forgotten (at least I have). His histories are melodic, packed with facts and personalities, and blessedly short. If you want to read more about a subject, buy a definitive history, but Howarth's books are great primers.<br />1066 tells us about Europe (well, England, Normandy, and Norway) at the dawn of the second AD millennium. He begins with the view of that world through the eyes of a tiny village near Hastings: how they lived, worked, and died. He effortlessly moves into the background of the Battle of Hastings and thrills us for the rest of the book with tales of Harold Hardrada and William the Conqueror and Kings Edward and Harold and, of course, the Battle of Hastings.<br />This and Howarth's other books should be required reading in high schools and universities, and for anyone who wants to find out what the world was like before they were born.	2001-07-20

I can see some of Dilbert in me, and some of me in Dilbert (especially the bent tie), and easily recognize parallels between Dilbert's workplace and mine. I at least have an office and don't have to live with the cubicle dwellers and my boss is somewhat brighter than Dilbert's, but it's still scary how realistic Dilbert's world is.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars except all of these cartoons appear, in sequence, in my 2001 Dilbert desk calendar, so I've already read many of them and I have no reason now to flip to the next day on my calendar. That's almost Dilbert-esque, in a way.	2001-07-13

(That still hasn't happened.) I was disappointed when I finally sat down to read it. The authors jump from story to story within paragraphs, many starting with &quot;So-and-so of Middle of Nowhere, Kansas, found out that what glitters isn't always gold.&quot; Rarely do they go in-depth into what it is really like to win a lottery. They interviewed many winners, it seems, but haven't been told much beyond the moment the winners discover they've won the jackpot and pick up their tickets. Most of the people who win lotteries do the same thing with their earnings: buy a new car, a new house, settle debts, go on a trip. Then they disappear from sight. Who cares! Buy lottery tickets instead of this book -- you'll be happier even if none of the tickets is a winner.	2001-07-02

He was not a goon, however -- he would end fights simply by wrapping his muscular arms around much-bigger players and pulling them apart. He was known for his generosity and gratitude. His teammates made gentle fun of his poor eyesight, calling him &quot;Cousin Weak-Eyes.&quot; Horton and Bobby Baun anchored a Leaf defense unmatched in team history.<br />Tragically, Tim Horton was killed in a car accident in February 1974. Hockey lost one of its heroes.<br />Craig MacInnis's REMEMBERING TIM HORTON is a terrific look back at the man and the legend. MacInnis and his roster of veteran journalists and writers bring us back to the days when honor meant more than stardom, when pride and winning meant more than a contract hold-out and who's picked higher in the NHL draft, when the Leafs were fighting to winning the Stanley Cup instead of hurrying to pack up their golf bags a few weeks earlier than the Cup champions.	2001-06-06

The rants, which, Carey says early on, his editors made him put in, are mostly lame, though the one where he tells the presidents where to go is pretty sharp. He's thrown in 101 &quot;members-only&quot; jokes, which he wrote with the help of the show's writers. Many of these are dumb, but some are pretty good. The short stories are just weird. They're a mix of fact and fiction, it seems. Some of these stories appear to have become episodes of The Drew Carey Show. Carey's reliving the themes from his childhood that make up the series: his disdain for wrongful sexual harassment charges, beer, being overweight, living in Cleveland, hanging out with friends, eating burgers and pizza.<br />The stuff in the middle of the book is great, especially the show's writers' back-and-forth with the ABC censors. It's a wonderful inside look at how a show is written and is transformed by the writers and the suits in the days before an episode is taped. I didn't buy Dirty Jokes and Beer for this material, but it's the best stuff in the book.<br />Admidst the humor, you can feel Carey's pain about the loss of his father, his weight, his difficulty in having a normal relationship with a woman, about being molested as a child, enduring substance abuse and depression, and surviving two suicide attempts. He tries to laugh off these moments, though they permeate the book. Carey tries to make us laugh even with baring his soul.<br />Beyond that, this book is an enjoyable romp through the eyes of Drew Carey, with some classic lines such as &quot;My favorite game to play in Las Vegas is hooker.&quot; Carey's story about Mardi Gras is priceless.<br />My advice: kick back and enjoy the dirty jokes with beer.	2001-06-03

FELICIA'S JOURNEY is filmic, Hitchcockian: Trevor gives direction to the characters, who take unexpected paths to unexpected ends. The darker sides of Felicia and Mr. Hilditch elude us. Trevor gives us only brief glimpses of them, like figures disappearing around corners when the lights of a car give them away.<br />Mr. Hilditch is one of the most memorable characters I've encountered of late. Like Count Fosco in Wilkie Collins' THE WOMAN IN WHITE, Hilditch appears to be a benign giant, overweight and always eating pastries, a charming man. Inside, however, he's dark. His past haunts him and compels him to act out unspeakable evils so unspeakable that Trevor leaves it up to us to figure out what exactly he has done. Therein lies the suspense: what are this man's crimes, what is the runaway Felicia up against, where are the bodies, if any? We watch, helpless, as Felicia slowly enters Hilditch's trap, wondering how she could possibly escape.<br />The suspense builds steadily throughout, especially as we learn more and more about Mr. Hilditch, as we begin to feel sorry for this tortured soul. FELICIA'S JOURNEY is a little slow, perhaps, but a worthwhile read nonetheless.	2001-05-22

Long before these books went to press, however, David Howarth penned THE SLEDGE PATROL, a remarkable story of survival and adventure. Written only a few years after the war, THE SLEDGE PATROL tells the story of seven Danish and Norwegian hunters and adventurers (and many Eskimos) who patrolled the entire east coast of Greenland during World War II on their own. Hundreds of miles of raw, icy coastline, thousands of square miles of nearly uninhabitable land, mountains, crevasses, driving blizzards, polar bears -- you ask, Why would anyone bother to protect that? The answer, as Howarth tells us so skillfully, is that the weather for the North Atlantic begins in Greeland, and accurate reports from just south of the north pole were vital to the survival of Allied convoys and the success of Axis U-boat patrols.<br />Seven men patrolled, by dogsled, the dangerous yet beautiful coast of Greenland, sending out weather forecasts to the British while sledding along the shore to report sightings of Germans in the vicinity. These men, who could hardly believe the Germans would or could venture this far north, one day find a strange footprint in the snow -- not theirs, not an Eskimo's. What begins is a 200-page race across the Arctic to evade the Nazis and end transmission of their weather reports back to Germany.<br />Howard writes of the beautiful danger of the Arctic, of hearty men who lived in harmony in the far north and who could not fathom evil in their midst. A great read.	2001-05-22

Over the next 725 (!) pages he continues that chase, which pulls him into the midst of an international conspiracy peopled by various criminals and comrades from France, the U.S., Germany, and Switzerland.<br />An entertaining read. Folsom has a nice way of interrupting the mundane with matter-of-fact horror. Still, there are long sections that could easily have been cut -- this should have been a 400-page book. Some of the plot twists are ludicrous, the good luck of some of the characters entirely unbelievable, but enjoy the book nonetheless. One other note -- the book is marred by numerous typos that should have been corrected in the paperback edition. A good beach read, or save it for a long, long train ride.	2001-05-09

Everest Disaster	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A remarkable tale of hubris, courage, and bad luck	I have little to add to the praise for Jon Krakauer's INTO THIN AIR, but I feel I must make my small contribution nonetheless. Each chapter of this stunning book builds upon the suspense of the last, becomes as chilling as the ill-fated 1996 expedition to the top of Everest itself. As we read we know the disaster looms just ahead over the next peak, but Krakauer lulls us into a sense of oxygen-deprived serenity -- much like Krakauer experienced on Everest -- before the storm hits and the horror begins.<br />An unbelievable story, truly, that made a folk hero out of Beck Weathers and the survivors the center of controversy for, perhaps, a foolhardy attempt at Everest's summit hours after the window of opportunity had been slammed shut.<br />Every day now, as I climb any hill or tall set of stairs and find myself out of breath, I'll think of the adventurers at the roof of the world -- out of oxygen, dehydrated, beaten by the hurricane-force winds, exposed to unbelievable cold -- and I'll quietly, and humbly, be on my way.	2001-04-29

It's the stuff of conversation -- quite conversation -- in coffee and barber shops around the world. The anecdotal evidence points to an obvious athletic edge for black athletes. Jon Entine, a journalist, not a scientist, has researched the subject fully, but still fails to come up with a valid argument.<br />The obvious question to ask Entine is &quot;Why?&quot; Why do we need to know that blacks are better athletes than whites? He does not answer this question in TABOO. Entine is passionate about this subject, but why? What does it matter to him? Does it help society to know there are racial differences, or even to establish that there are different races in the first place? I'm not dismissing the need to find out if blacks make better athletes. We always want answers even to unanswerable questions.<br />TABOO winds through more than 300 pages of Entine's rhetoric, unnecessarily so. Rarely does his premise surface. Often he tells us for dozens of pages how great black athletes are, but doesn't tell us why they're better than white athletes. His argument is uneven. He lauds scientists and science that support his view, and dismisses as crackpots those scientists and sociologists who disagree.<br />Though he doesn't say as much, Entine's basic argument is that blacks are better athletes than whites because they just are. It's obvious. Don't you watch the Olympics, everybody? Or watch the highlights on ESPN?<br />Entine uses socioeconomic evidence to support his claim at times -- blacks are better basketball players because it's an inexpensive game to play -- but at other times ignores the evidence. He doesn't say that blacks would be better at expensive, elite sports such as sailing and fencing if the sports were entirely open to blacks and more affordable. He ignores the interesting example of hockey, a sport that features few black players, but which is seeing more and black players taking itup. Hockey is an expensive sport. Will blacks, as socioeconomic conditions improve, one day dominate hockey, too?<br />I was intrigued by the very idea of this book when I saw it in the bookstore. I wish Entine could have written a less convoluted and more scientific book. Still, perhaps it is better not to know if blacks are better athletes than whites after all.	2001-04-23

The Woman in White is truly a classic. Count Fosco and Frederick Fairlie will long remain in my memory as unusual creations. Fosco, in particular, is a remarkable concoction: big and fat, but strong and quick; highly intelligent, yet conniving and evil. The protagonist, Walter Hartright, brings us the story in the words of a middle-class hero, who speaks easily to nobility and the lower classes alike. In the eerie opening scene, Hartright encounters the Woman in White on a dark country road. She appears as a ghost at his shoulder and startles him. He helps her escape the police. Thus begins his quest to uncover her identity and to unearth the mystery surrounding Limmeridge House and the Woman in White.<br />Invest in The Woman in White.

These lifers don't trust easily. Earley has done a remarkable job of extricating the most fascinating details of the lives of hardened criminals. He shares their stories of childhood crime and imprisonment, of killing for fun and profit, of escaping, of fighting and murdering in prison. We learn of the self-imposed segregation of blacks and whites in prison, even among friends, and just how thankless a job being a prison guard is.<br />The material is poorly organized, however. Earley's style is to tell a chapter about one inmate, then not revisit that inmate's tale until later on. This works, but not always. He begins the book with an excellent story about one of the inmates, then inexplicably gives a lengthy history of the prison, then returns to the anecdotes. Earley did the same thing in Super Casino, though it worked in that book.<br />I hope that Earley continues to infiltrate and study and share with us fascinating stories of unusual people.	2001-04-04

For those of you who have never been to Las Vegas, Pete Earley's SUPER CASINO will give you a good background to the most intense city in North America. For those of you who have been to Vegas, this book will remind you of why you went, why you came back with great memories (though with a lot less cash), and will make you want to call your travel agent and book your next trip there.<br />SUPER CASINO is a curious hybrid -- half history, half personal anecdotes. The history tells of the Circus Circus company, from its earliest days under weirdo Jay Sarno, to its recent reincarnation in the form of the Egyptian-style casino Luxor and its Strip neighbor Mandalay Bay. The corporate history of Circus Circus is fascinating. Imagine starting out with nothing, buying/building casinos, then gambling enough profits every day to keep a family of four going for a few years.<br />The anecdotes of the denizens of the Strip breathe life into this book, though they don't really mix well with the Circus Circus material. Really the anecdotes belong in a book of their own. Earley interviewed Las Vegas cab drivers, blackjack dealers, prostitutes, security chiefs, showgirls. Each has a fascinating story of the desert paradise.<br />Ignore the structural problems with the book and simply enjoy reading about Las Vegas.	2001-03-11

After that, however, this 300+ page novel plods ahead.<br />Rainie Conner, a female police officer in Bakersfield, Oregon, must push back her own demons and move the case ahead against the son of a friend. Conner, who as a teenager found her mother's dead, dripping body in their living room, must somehow come to terms with this new bloody crime scene while reliving her past. And the real killer, as we're told even on the back of the cover, is out to get her.<br />Rainie is a caricature -- 110 pounds of rage and savvy, keeping men at bay, keeping her emotions deep inside. Her dialogue is inane. Pierce Quincy, the FBI love interest, besides having a ridiculous name, is perfect -- perfect suits, perfect hair, perfect eyes. Shep O'Grady is Bakersfield's bumbling, drunk sheriff who knows the truth about what happened to Rainie's mother.<br />Take a pass on this one. Other than in the first and the last few pages, there's little suspense. The Third Victim is part unthriller, part Harlequin unromance. Unlike in typical thrillers, there's nothing -- nothing! -- to keep you reading at the end of each chapter. The characters are empty, the dialogue will make you laugh out loud. I suggest that Lisa Gardner go read a few Hardy Boys novels if she wants to learn about pacing and suspense.	2001-03-06

Stephen Williams covers every detail in his study of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, and the rapes and murders of Tammy Homolka, Leslie Mahaffy, and Kristen French. Every horrid detail. This book is not for the easily disturbed. Williams leaves nothing out, not the details of the rapes and murders, not one iota of personal information -- he even includes addresses of the victims' families. Therein lies the one major flaw of this book -- overinformation. A good editor would have trimmed 200 pages from this book and Williams still would have told the entire story. Still, Williams has proven himself an excellent researcher, and an adequate writer. It's only too bad that our society continues to give writers like Williams fodder for future books.	2001-02-25

But now I'm sure she had to cut some stories -- maybe she's saving them for the second edition. Some of these reports seem too ridiculous to be true. She's right, though -- we should thank these people for exiting the gene pool. How can we address humanity's greatest challenges -- starvation, human rights abuses, cures for disease -- when we kill ourselves trying to get into Metallica concerts for free?<br />This book's a pretty good bathroom reader, though it isn't without its problems. The introductions to each part are inane, and hardly relate to the material that follows. In some of the stories it isn't clear what happens to the people involved. Also, I think the book would have worked better with the urban legends collected in their own section instead of sprinkled throughout. Somehow, mixed in with true stories, they're given legitimacy.<br />Anyway, bring on volume II!	2001-02-15

Minor (the Madman) and their unique relationship, which led in part to the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. Minor, suffering from paranoia, kills a man in Lambeth, London, in a fearful panic, and is placed in an asylum. He finds a life preserver in a published request by Murray, editor of the dictionary, asking for submissions to the great tome. For decades, Minor descends further into madness while feeding supporting quotations for word definitions to the OED staff.<br />Winchester draws the story slowly, exceedingly so. He seems to admire the long length of Dickensian texts because this book is as verbese, suffering from the weight of its wordiness. Repeatedly you'll find yourself asking the author to get to the point. Why spend numerous pages explaining the etymology of a single word within the story? Even Winchester's acknowledgements plod on for seven pages.<br />Curiously, Winchester hasn't included any photos in the book. He could have saved us some of his lengthy descriptions by providing photos instead. He has not included an index either, a strange omission for a book about the creation of perhaps the greatest index ever compiled.<br />Many will undoubtedly enjoy the saga of Murray and Minor, though few will enjoy it (or Winchester) as much as Winchester does.	2001-01-01

The ship encountered a giant sperm whale in the middle of the ocean. The whale attacked the ship, disabling it, sending the men into the whaleships, where most of them would live, and die, for eighty-odd days. This is a rich tale of courage, starvation, cannibalism, and racial politics.<br />Nathaniel Philbrick's account of the ill-fated Essex is thick with history. Philbrick has meticulously researched his book, evidenced by the extensive notes and bibliography. Still, In the Heart of the Sea lacks the heart of Erik Larson's excellent Isaac's Storm, in my mind the book of the year. For all of Philbrick's keen facts and thoroughness, his writing is often academic-sounding, and he does not boldly follow historical tangents as Larsen does so well. Don't get me wrong, In the Heart of the Sea is a remarkable book, well deserving of the National Book Award. I think, however, that Larson deserved it more.	2000-12-26

MacInnis's book seems lost in this same storm -- it jumps here and there and gets caught up in the waves of controversy. Only thirty pages or so deal with the actual sinking. The rest of the book covers the construction of the ship, the aftermath of the sinking, the telling of the families, the investigation, the scabs who harvested the Fitz for cash, and, of course, Gordon Lightfoot's famous song. The book tries to be everything and ends up being little.<br />MacInnis writes in an overwrought style, mixing metaphors and making poor analogies. Still, if it wasn't for his purple prose, the book would have come in far short of its 126 pages.<br />MacInnis obviously has a vendetta against the poachers who salvaged the Fitz. He writes about them with fury, calling them heartless thieves, which they probably are, but he loses objectivity here. Much like the Edmund Fitzgerald on that stormy November night in 1975, MacInnis falls off course and grounds himself on a shoal of confusion.	2000-12-21

DISGRACE is a difficult read from beginning to end, but a satisfying one.<br />David Lurie, professor of communication of a university in Cape Town, has an affair with a 20-year-old student, and when their relationship falls apart, he pays dearly for his misuse of power. He cooperates with the university's authorities, who want something more than he can give, and banishes himself to his daughter's farm/kennel at what seems to be the edge of the world.<br />Father and daughter suffer a brutal attack, and though the pain and shame of the event should bring the two together, they're driven apart -- she by his fathering, he by her wish to keep the attack quiet and remain on the farm.<br />I admire much in this novel, especially the character of David Lurie. He pays out far more than he owes. The image of fire engulfs him, in the poetry of Byron, the fire during the attack, and the burning of dogs. Unlike the phoenix, however, Lurie is unable to rise again. He can save no one, nothing. The ending is pure heartbreak.<br />Coetzee skillfully weaves his tale without hammerhanded comment on racism and class, though, like the poor people living in the shanties not far from the Lurie farm, they're there.	2000-12-04

The subtitle -- Inside the Toronto Raptors' First Season -- is misleading. Jack Batten discusses the team from before they were even created until the end of their second season. The most interesting stuff in the book lies in the discussion of schmoozing with David Stern and the other NBA bigwigs in trying to lure the NBA to Toronto. Batten covers the usual expansion woes -- bad players doing bad things -- with flair. He interviewed all of the key people involved.<br />The drawbacks of this book are many: no index, no stats, only eight pages of photos (and black-and-white ones at that), and the ending just hangs out there, with the drafting of Marcus Camby. The book tries to be a little too much, and ends up being a little less.	2000-12-04

I read this book in 40 minutes -- 20 minutes on the bus on the way to work, 20 minutes on the way back. The little mouse story is cute, and the author makes a lot of sense, but all you really find out is that you need to look at yourself and think about what you will have to do when everything you count on changes.<br />Here's the author's cheat sheet summarizing the book -- for free!:<br />* change happens * anticipate change * monitor change * adapt to change quickly * change * enjoy change<br />* be ready to quickly change again and again<br />Some good lessons, great marketing, and a lot of hype. Wait for the paperback.	2000-11-30

The narrative grows like the mounting winds of the hurricane, reaching a sudden crescendo that surprises the reader as much as the storm might have surprised its victims.<br />I'd give this book five stars but for the lack of photographs. Larson describes existing photos in vivid detail, but for some reason hasn't included them in the book. After reading about the devastation and heartbreak, I wanted to see it for myself, however morbid that may be. It's hard to believe that one storm could do so much damage and kill so many.<br />Isaac's Storm surpasses The Perfect Storm, its closest rival in storm-disaster books, in narrative, structure, language, detail, and pacing. Well done, Mr. Larson.<br />Next up: In the Heart of the Sea.	2000-11-02

In On Writing, Stephen King shares with us the motivations and mechanics behind the man who has become perhaps the greatest storyteller of our time. I gained some excellent insights into King, how he crafts his fiction, and why he writes horror novels.<br />The jacket copy calls the structure of the book &quot;brilliant,&quot; but I found it a weakness. King states early on that On Writing is not an autobiography, but a large part of it is. King has written a memoir, but just doesn't know it. For almost half the book he tells us about his New England childhood, his mother's terrible illness, and meeting his wife, Tabitha, and he ends the book with an excellent piece on being run over by Bryan Smith and how writing became a good part of his therapy.<br />I love all that stuff -- it's the best stuff in the book, and it's far more telling of King's development as a writer than the straightforward writing instruction (which you can find in most other books on writing) -- mechanics, grammar, writing a good cover letter, getting an agent.<br />His chapters on writing are less useful, I think, but are still interesting reading. King spins twenty pages or so about getting Carrie published. I could have read an entire book about the publishing history of each of his forty-odd titles.<br />You get three books in one with On Writing, folks, and each one's damned good. I was sad when it all ended.	2000-10-25

Blown-up covers from both series liven up the book, triggering memories of adrenaline surging through the veins of teenagers everywhere.<br />The material on how the books changed over the years -- especially the evolution of racial stereotypes of &quot;Negroes,&quot; Jews, and Italians -- is truly fascinating. I never realized that the books I read in the seventies had been homogenized by a factory of authors. I now want to read the original books, if I can find them (eBay here I come!).<br />I could do without most of the overlong and annoying sidebars. Again and again they fill us in on how teens have changed over the last century, but seldom are the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew even mentioned in them!<br />I give this book an &quot;A&quot; for the terrific images and accurate and enlightening history, but overall, marred by some poor editorial decisions, the book deserves a &quot;B.&quot; Still, this is required reading for those interested in pop culture and the literature of our youth. Now I'm off to solve the Secret of the Caves . . .	2000-10-17

From his nights flying over Berlin to the bombing of North Africa to his time spent convalescing after a crash (when he went on some of his most dangerous missions), Hewer spares few details in providing a colorful first-hand account. Anyone with even a passing interest in war memoirs, or who truly enjoys the view of the world from 10,000 feet, should read this book. Without a doubt the best memoir I've read in a long time.	2000-10-11

Tim Green, who keeps telling us how smart he is, rarely gives us the scoop.  He'll say, &quot;Someone I knew did this once.&quot; On groupies, he tells  us that NFL players stay away from them, and can't get girls -- yeah,  right. In a book about the dark side of the game, he fails to address the  type of violence demonstrated recently in the Rae Carruth, Ray Lewis, and  Fred Lane situations, nor does he explore the NFL's drug culture -- Bam  Morris, Andre Rison -- nor does he get into the real problems with college  football and how so many players with college educations can be so dumb. I  was hoping for something better.	2000-08-15

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was worth the wait. You can, for once, believe the hype. I stayed up all night reading this book after buying it at midnight at my local bookstore.

He's got a gift with words, for fabulous turns of phrase. But he's an angry young man, caught up in his grief, and sounds entranced by his talent and his initiative. His angst comes out in  his prose, though he sometimes depends too much on vulgarity to get his  message across.<br />The man is widely loved for this story of a family  surviving back-to-back tragedies, and justifiably so. The first part of  this book is as sad and tragic as anything I've read. It falls off from  there, but it's still a fine read. I've read that Eggers turned down $1  million for the movie rights, and that he hates promotion. That tactic has  helped his book grow from underground sensation to bona fide bestseller; I  doubt he's turning down his royalties. I hope they don't make a movie out  of AHWOSG -- they couldn't improve much on the book.	2000-06-20

Each word in this incredibly rich story is carefully rendered. Each sentence grows on the one just read, and each paragraph is a story all its own. MacLeod is a master of fiction. He has few peers.<br />The story glides along, oozing with history and pain and sentiment. The MacDonald clan, through the eyes of Alexander MacDonald, comes clearly to life. We follow the clan for more than 200 years after they leave Scotland. To this family, history is all-important, and family is everything. The red- and black-haired and dark-eyed MacDonalds survive heartbreak and loss in the &quot;land of the trees&quot; -- Cape Breton -- and dig out a new life on the Maritime shores. Young Alexander and his twin sister live with their grandparents, near their other grandfather, and are eternally schooled in their family's past. I felt honoured to share in their history, to soak in their very lives. From the coast of Scotland to the hard-rock mines of northern Ontario to the bleary streets of today's Toronto, MacLeod takes us on a road seldom taken in modern fiction. Buy this book at any price.	2000-06-18

Those who work closely with authors to help them develop their work will appreciate it even more.<br />Korda gives us a rare inside look at  how publishers publish. He shares with us how he got into the business, how  he climbed the S&amp;S ladder, and how he came to run the editorial  department of one of the most successful houses in publishing history. He  tells us hilarious and eye-opening stories of Tennessee Williams and  Jacqueline Susann and Harold Robbins. We learn just how much work editors  put into creating bestsellers. We find out who the authors are and who the  writers are. If you're like me, you'll read these stories as you would a  bowl of candy. You'll eat and eat until you're scratching at the bottom of  the bowl for more.<br />I don't recommend this book without reservation,  however. Michael Korda, the famous editor, could have used even a junior  editor to help him dig out his story. At times, the book thuds along,  caught up in Korda's telling of the history of publishing in the United  States. His asides into the money side of the business -- how publishing  developed from a cottage industry into a mere cog in larger multinational  entertainment companies -- is numbing. Still, I soaked in these parts of  his story to get to the good parts.<br />Korda is not a great writer, though  he worked with many, and has a wonderful story to tell. Skip past the dull  moments if you like, but most definitely read this book.	2000-06-18

As Sherlock Holmes said (in not so many words), our fear of the wilderness is greater than our fear of the city.

Lions gnawing on brains, crocodiles clamping down  between legs, jaguars thrashing from person to person, tearing out jugulars  -- all slendidly recounted.<br />Not a book for the faint, but a must for  those in search of tales of adventure and survival.	2000-06-11

Cederberg spares few details of the courage and the horror of war, and shows how love  and lust often bloomed among the destroyed buildings and shattered souls.

The last half of the book is particularly good; the action is thick and well described, and the characters come right through. I read the last twenty pages of the  narrative holding my hand up on the page, moving it down line by line so I  wouldn't spoil the ending.<br />However, I have many problems with the  structure of this book, the main one being that The Perfect Storm is  essentially a 300-page magazine article, betraying its roots as a story in  Outside magazine. The true narrative could have been wrapped up in about  200 pages, perhaps less. I didn't need to read 100 pages about the history  of swordboats in the Atlantic, nor did I need intricate descriptions of  fishing and how satellites work. The true value of this book is in the  action and the telling of the human story, which Junger does well.<br />The  other problem is that I expected, with all of the hype, for this to be a  book about the Andrea Gail, but there are many other stories worked in,  some of which take even greater stage. The material on the PJs is even  better than the tale of the poor souls on board the AG. The spattering of  stories about other ships going down is thoroughly enjoyable. Junger,  however, pulled me right out of the action and threw me into the slow  beginnings of a different scene.<br />I recommend reading this book. The  Perfect Storm and books like it have brought the genre of non-fiction  narrative back to life, which is a good thing. Still, I think I might enjoy  the movie even more.	2000-06-10

Amid the clamor of bright lights, designer names, the latest in stereophonic equipment, and the hottest new Manhattan clubs, Patrick Bateman swirls and tumbles into the abysmal depths of his mind, the  depravity that it seems he and all of his clones on Wall Street are capable  of. The monotony, the blandness of throwing around cash and Gold Cards is  enough to drive anyone to execution.<br />Midway through this book, stunned  into uncaring by Ellis's repetitive style, boring like a drill into my  skull, I was ready to tear the book into strips and go on a rampage. No  wonder Bateman feels so compelled to maim and kill. His unrelentingly  boring rich lifestyle demands it.<br />Read this book if you want. Ignore the  hype, and take the book for what it is, a commentary on excess and  homogeneity, and one man's perhaps unguided efforts to bust out of his  coffinlike existence.	2000-05-22

This is the story about Sarah, or Tabitha, a stripper from BC. Many different aspects of her life conflict: her relationship with her mother and her father, her slug boyfriend Lloyd, and her own past history with disease that has disfigured her. She is highly intelligent and literate, in part owed to her father, an English professor. This makes her stand out among strippers. <BR> I found this book to be overwritten, and pretentious in some places. We get the feeling that Tabitha thinks she's better than the other strippers because she can quote Dante, yet she's exactly like the rest of them.
