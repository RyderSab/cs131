But the Best American series continues to be consistent. My only complaint is the policy to exclude people of other nationalities whose stories are published in American magazines. Where the story is published, not the writer's nationality, should be the criteria. For example, my favorte short story writer, Haruki Murakami, who is frequently published in the New Yorker, is excluded. To add insult to injury, the policy is arbitrary so that Canadian writer Alice Munro (one of my favorites, no disrespect toward her) is included.<br /><br />In any event, here are some highlights:<br /><br />1. The Smile on Happy Chang's Face by Tom Perrotta. Vintage Perrotta fiction of adult children who are playing house while suffering from their infantile ways. The story could have been swiped from the pages of Perrotta's masterpiece novel The Little Children. Here a divorced husband who rejected his gay teenage son tries to resolve his family conflicts while umpiring Little Leage baseball games.<br /><br />2. Stone Animals by Kelly Link. One of the most original young writers around, Link writes \\"ghost\\" stories full of domestic angst such as this one about a family moving into a strange house.<br /><br />3. Silence by Alice Munro. A mother grieves the separation of her daughter who decides to flee from her parents' problems by joining a cult in the Canadian wilderness. The cult is headed by an elephantine half-witted, self-aggrandizing matriarch. You will despise this woman.<br /><br />4. Death Defier by Tom Bissell, an American journalist covering the Middle-East conflict becomes more and more deranged leading to the story's climax. A great story about America's role in Afghanistan and Iraq and the complexities of being a journalist over there.<br /><br />5. The Girls by Joy Williams. Perhaps inspired by Flannery O'Conner's Good Country People. Two thirty-something sisters, still living with their parents, seem like in part the reincarnation of O'Conner's Hulga. Like that grotesque, these sisters are full of intellectual pride while blind to their repulsive arrested development. They mentally torture their parents' houseguests.<br /><br />6. Natasha by David Bezmozgis. Perhaps one of the best stories I've read in the last seven years. A Canadian boy hosts a Russian teenage girl and discovers that she made adult films to get by in the moral wasteland of modern Russia. This is one of the most devastating loss-of-innocence stories I've ever read.part the reincarnation of O'Conner's Hulga.

His thesis is that we have become actors, either unconsciously or not, and that as such events are contrived and/or interpreted as being \\"cinamatic.\\" We all want to be the stars of the movie, that which is life.<br /><br />Another important theme is that entertainment has trumped substantive knowledge in the media currency so that we are well entertained but grossly underinformed.<br /><br />He quotes from and praises Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, a fine companion piece to Gabler's Life: The Movie.	2005-09-12

Scapegoating the Jews as the necessary evil force that rejects Christ, Paul misportrays Christ as a savior figure modelled after Mystery Cults. Maccoby argues that Jesus saw himself differently, as Jewish Messiah with political intentions to create a Utopia, a common type of Messiah during his time.<br /><br />Paul comes across as a back-stabbing misanthrope who will do anything to make himself the most prominent religious figure of all time, in part by creating myth, in part by claiming divine visions, and in part by parasiting the Jewish tradition for his own aims.<br /><br />The book achieves much in showing the connection between Paul's Christianity and anti-semitimism.	2005-09-09

Unfortunately, Indiana's language, his strength, is also his weakness. He is so excessive in his verbiage, his obscene sexual metaphors, his overreaching anger, that the prose takes on a redundant quality and worse his ornate fire-breathing language becomes a distraction from his very compelling and insightful polemic. With such great insight and such a profound content, he didn't need to go overboard and razzle-dazzle us with his fireworks language display, which becomes in this book an unfortunate side circus and makes the important issues of fraud, self-promotion, and a gullible voting populace seem at times flippant. It's okay to be maddenned and outraged by our degraded political discourse, but show some discipline and tell the story of Arnold's disturbing political ascent without showing off your literary powers at such an excessive and obsessive degree.	2005-07-26

Tosches' conceit is that he suffers from diabetes and that the opium is his only cure. But his real mission is to discover in opium life's most ethereal and sublime pleasures. He contrasts the higher pleasures with those phony snobs who, fond of detecting black licorice and bell pepper in their expensive wines, repel Tosche so much with their philistinism that he goes on an exotic quest for not just elusive opium dens but the faraway pleasures of the senses. In many ways Tosches' sensibility reminds me of the TV and writing persona of gourmet gadfly chef Antony Bourdain who disdains popular culture attractions and always looks for food in the dark margins of the far reaches of the world. Bourdain fans will like Tosches and vice versa.	2005-07-26

Nunn's novel deals with a lot of violence and bloodshed, specifically of Earl Dean's forebears, that surrounds the history of Pomona's making. In that context we go into the nightmare world of Earl Dean, a vacuum cleaner salesman who goes to one house too many to sell his wares. His final house is owned by a drug-soaked, violent Dan Brown who kidnaps Earl Dean to conduct an order of business so bizarre you feel like you're entering a nightmare. Indeed, the nightmarish quality, punctuated by grotesque humor, evokes the dream journey, complete with perdition and the longing for redemption, which has similar components that we see in Mulholland Dr. In both the film and Pomona Queen, the dream journey is a sort of wish-fulfillment  fantasy and in both the dream journey is never arbitrary or weird for weird's sake. There is a psychological realism that makes the events seem necessary and logical.<br /><br />Earl Dean, a down and out vacuum salesman who's been duped by his stepfather and the world in general is looking for redemption, courage, and belonging. You'll have to read this harrowing, often bleakly funny novel to see if he finds them.	2005-07-16

True perhaps but the craft and aristry of Coetzee is so exquisite that he pulls it off. Here's the situation: An aging writer Elizabeth Costello, award-winnning novelist and humanist and animal lover, is asked to lecture after winning her awards and she speaks on a variety of subjects--the role and responsibility of the novelist, the nature of evil, Christianity vs. Greek philosophy, the brutality of animals and an argument for vegetarianism, the nature of the third-world novel. Each subject is presented in a separate chapter in which Costello either lectures or argues with other intelligent people, so that you get, not just Costello's worldview, but a vigorous opposition.<br /><br />In this way, Costello's views don't go unchallenged. Also her views, especially comparing the slaughter of animals to the Holocaust, causes great controversy and animosity between her and the community. In another case, she accuses the novelist Paul West of exploiting Nazi evil in his graphic and indulgent portrayals of it resulting in the writing community to accuse her of cencorship. These contentious scenes give her arguments a context and a drama that essays wouldn't have provided.<br /><br />Vulnerable, fragile at times, not always prepared to answer her detractors, Elizabeth Costello is a very human advocate for her positions and never comes across as a bullying superhuman to mouthpiece Coetzee's philosophy. He's too subtle an artist for that.<br /><br />I think there is a place for a novel of ideas. Gulliver's Travels and Voltaire certainly were such novels and Elizabeth Costello is worthy of following their lead.	2005-07-08

As foul as Buddy is and as important his scheme is to the plot, he is not really the focus of the novel. The real focus is Buddy's son Ralph, a sympathetic adolescent overwrought by natural lusts and in possession of an honesty and integrity that his father lacks. It is those chapters told from Ralph's POV where the novel really shines for at its heart Sneaky People is, for all its lusty rogues and ironic twists and turns, a sweet and tender novel about a wholesome boy awakening to his sexuality and connecting that sexuality to a gallant form of manhood that his father, sadly, never showed him.<br /><br />Only Berger, a true original, could pull off a novel like this: Part seedy, malicious plotline, part perverted, unctuous characters, and part tender loss of innocence story--told with the sneaky, ironic syntax that Berger is so famous for.<br /><br />One last point: The childhood friendship between Ralph and his vulgar, bullying neighbor Hauser seems to have been used for a later novel, when they've reached middle-age, in what for me is Berger's best novel, titled Best Friends.	2005-07-03

However, the aforementioned themes are rendered with expertise, vigor, and indeed pure poetic prose so that even a cynic like myself was able to surrender to Doerr's magical stories. Here are some highlights:<br /><br />1. The Shell Collector: A scientist who collects shells lives like a hermit in a isolated coastal land in Kenya where he discovers an elixir, derived from a sea snail, which forces him to contemplate the manner in which civilization usurps all of nature's wonders for its commercial purposes.<br /><br />2. The Hunter's Wife: A man takes his wife into the barren wilderness where she eventually leaves him to pursue a career as a celebrity New Age figure.<br /><br />3. The Caretaker: An African refugee who has seen unspeakable evil during civil war and has been coerced into doing something that violates his conscience moves to an ocean house in Oregon where he learns, through the help of a young woman, to find his redemption.<br /><br />4. Mkondo: A white fossil hunter goes to Tanzania where he becomes obsessed with a young African woman whom he marries and takes back to Ohio. There the woman languishes in despair until she finds her vocation in photography, which brings her closer to nature.<br /><br />Over and over again, Doerr pits the vulgarity and soul-sapping forces of civilization with the pure spiritual powers of nature as his characters attempt to straddle both worlds.<br /><br />For a thematic companion to Doerr's stories, you might want to look into the 1971 film masterpiece, set in Australia, called The Walkabout, which wonderfully is now available on DVD.	2005-06-28

But there is something far deeper in this book: The fascinating analysis of how Escobar made himself into a mythical figure beloved by the Columbians. Bowden does an excellent job of showing the historical forces that positioned Escobar to take advantage of the people's hunger for a great mythic icon. Bowden describes the history of acrimony between the people and the government and how banditos were elevated into revolutionary figures who represented the voice of the poor and the powerless. Assuming this moniker of Populist Savior, Escobar amassed a huge empire in the 1980s and indulged in sociopathic hedonism, ruthless violence, and shrewd entrepreneurialism as he fancied himself a sort of god, a figure who lived above the law, and figure whose sheer power made him worthy of being loved by all. These megalomaniacal delusions are well rendered in the book's first sixty pages as Bowden gives us a psychological profile to accompany a chronicle of Escobar's rise to riches and glory. The pleasure-seeking excesses and sadism are  vividly described as Bowden sets the stage for a morality tale: the man who would be god must come crashing down. The most disturbing thing about this book is that it shows that people, no matter how smart, are so hungry to believe in a savior that they will hinge their hopes on a clever sociopath when he knows how to elevate himself into a mythical figure.	2005-06-16

The premise, a twenty-something Joe Lon Mackey is stuck in a trailer home with a woman he loathes and several hungry children while he escapes with recent memories of his glory football days, drinking moonshine, and helping the town with its annual snake festival. Vipers are a prominent image in this novel, which is, among other things, a refutation of unchecked masculinity. The men in this novel thrive on violence and primal expressions of masculinity to fill their void. It is this need to fill the void with a demonic energy that informs the novel's viper metaphor.<br /><br />The plot is easy to follow enough. We watch Joe Lon Mackey and others go down a descent of debauchery as they seethe with rage and resentment, partly because they sense there is a better life out there and partly because they have no real vision of what that better life could be.<br /><br />With a parallel to The Great Gatsby, we see Joe Lon Mackey long for his high school sweetheart, Berenice, a stuckup cipher who thinks she's superior to all the locals after she leaves to town to go to an elitist college in the north east. Her world becomes the chimera in the way that Daisey's became a chimera or a mirage to Gatsby.<br /><br />For all its nihilitic despair and Dantean violence, there is enough humor in this novel to keep it bouyant. It is also a short, terse 175 pages, crammed with themes about the chimera, the lost American Dream, male violence, tribalistic bonding rituals, racism, and the need for some kind of \\"religion,\\" even a venomous one, in order to fill the abyss.	2005-06-09

The subject, those masses of people who give up everything and join movements, political, religious, you name it. Hoffer, who thankfully abjures academic prose in favor of precise aphorisms, lays out the psychological shortcomings of \\"true believers\\": They are misfits with no family or social connections; they have trouble with intimacy; they have nothing vested in society and as such have nothing to lose; they have weak identities and want to escape their failings by disappearing into the cachet that a large organization affords; they are do-gooders without a solid foundation to justify their position; they are often dangerous and fanatical because they are not well grounded and have nothing at stake; frustrated with their own failures, they hold a grudge against the successful and seek to upturn society and create havoc and a \\"revolution\\" in order to spite the successful.<br /><br />In many ways, the profile we get is that of terrorists; thus, Hoffer's classic analysis bears relevance today as we seek to quell the unrest and aggression from the True Believer mindset.<br /><br />Short, easy-to-read, compelling, absent of academic pretentiousness, The True Believer deserves its place as a \\"Perennial Classic.\\"	2005-06-09

Reilly, a thirty-something \\"genius\\" who lives with his mother and finds work of all kinds repulvise, has a passion for philosophy, bombast, and jelly donuts. His quest is to save mankind from its vulgarity by sharing his wisdom with the masses. Unfortunately, the French Quarter and the world at large is not prepared to appreciate this rotund neurotic's widsom, which he flails at people with great supercilious venom. The plotlines are too many to account here. Told from the point of view of Ignatius and other comic characters, the novel is not so much plot-driven as it is a slice of life capturing the folly of the human race.<br /><br />Ignatius is a comic hero worthy of Don Quixote; only he isn't killing imaginary dragons; he is on a quest to kill popular culture's meretricious debauchery. For example, he is hostile toward Doris Day and all forms of sentimentality.<br /><br />Many subsequent novels have tried to imitate the humor in the Confederacy but most have failed. For a worthy modern comic masterpiece, check out The Lecturer's Tale by James Hynes.	2005-06-04

For example, he shows that Mercedes tells a story about the craftsmanship of an earlier age when quality mattered; Toyota Prius flatters its buyers by telling them how smart and righteous they are; the wearer of Puma sneakers is asserting her maturity and independence. Godin argues that if you can't market your product into a story that appeals to your target customer's self-image, you're out of the game. He shows the basic stories we tell ourselves but warns that there are distinct \\"worldviews\\" that are constantly changing and that a marketer has to know the worldview at any given time. Grodin uses several salient examples to support his points but the book seems like a \\"quickie,\\" written quickly and shorter than it need be.<br /><br />For a companion book about the way consumers buy products that flatter their self-image, check out David Brooks' Bobos in Paradise.	2005-06-01

With well-founded documentation, he shows in readable prose the Bush Administration's predisposition to invade Iraq. He shows for example how the Administration ignored the International Atomic Energy Agency's report that Iraq did not have WMDs. What's even more disturbing is that the Administration bypassed the vetting process, known as \\"stovepiping,\\" whereby information is filtered meticulously before it reaches the President's hands. In this manner, the President, in theory, won't make any life or death decisions, such as waging war, based on faulty information, but he shows how Bush dangerously and recklessly ceased using these safeguards.<br /><br />Over and over, Hersh provides evidence, from both Right and Left sources, including the CIA, that Bush relied on corruption to get us bogged down into the disastrous war in Iraq. And I haven't even touched on the prisoner scandals which are chronicled here. No doubt about it, Hersh has written a masterpiece about highly-organized government deceit and corruption.	2005-05-28

His book is an attempt to explain this paradox as it occurs in affluent societies. I think he succeeds though I doubt many will want to hear his prescription: Curb our appetites and stop hinging our happiness on materialistic acquisition.<br /><br />He does a good job of showing how our desires are insatiable because of something called \\"reference anxiety,\\" the need to always compare what we have to things that are constantly getting better than what we can acquire.<br /><br />His solution to our soul's greed and avarice is pretty much common sense: We should learn to forgive others; we should find a sense of community and purpose in our lives to fill the void; we should be grateful for what we have; we should find ways to reduce stress. While this may sound trite and full of platitudes, Easterbrook does an excellent job at the end of his book for refuting nihilism, the belief that there is no purpose in life, no right and wrong. He argues effectively that the very philosophers who claim that the world is a \\"cosmic accident\\" are the same people who push for human rights, improving the environment, and so on and as such their activism contradicts their claim that \\"nothing matters.\\" Finishing his book with a lecture on the importance of finding meaning and purpose, while being a bit predictable, is well articulated and said in a new and different way so that the book is still a valuable diagnosis and prescription of our modern woes and the manner in which we can find a way out.	2005-05-26

He infiltrates the country's most violent motorcycle gang, The Mongols, and earns his stripes by faking drugs and acting as tough as the barbarians who are scrutinizing his every move. One of the most harrowing elements of the book is the author's ability to profile the motorcycle gangster mentality. These are men who devote their whole life to purging whatever goodness they have in them out of their system and to becoming as evil, sociopathic, and violent as possible. Why? Because, the author points out, they worship one thing only--power and the way to achieve that power is to instill fear in others. The sampling of grotesqueries the author describes is frightening enough, but all the more terrifying since any second we fear that William Queen will be found out and killed. One thing that makes the book so suspensful is that throughout the book Queen maintains a dreadful tension between the gangs' love for him and their suspcicion of him. You never know if and when the facade is going to crack. I'll let you read the book to find out how it ends. One thing for sure, this book will be made into a film. I'm sure the movie rights have already been sold. And what a great movie it will be.	2005-05-21

He divides his book into three parts: First, he profiles the backgrounds and personality profiles of the hijackers, many who started as regular citizens and slowly drifted into their extremism, often by chance. Second, he explains the political forces in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan that helped to revive Jihad and give power to Osama Bin Laden. Third, he focuses on the actual plot to hijack the planes on 9/11. The reportage is remarkable and provides clues to the hijackers' personalities that have so far not been publicized. What's scary is the effective way the author shows the hijackers often came from privileged backgrounds and then drifted into the fringes of society where, needing direction and identity, they were susceptible to the extremist rhetoric of fundamentalism and violent jihad. Where I might disagree with McDermott is his characterization of the hijackers as \\"fairly ordinary men.\\" Perhaps I have a different definition of \\"ordinary\\" than does McDermott who uses hundreds of salient illustrations to paint these men anything than as ordinary: They are often portrayed as sullen spoiled narcissistic brats and bullies. One of the most prominent of the hijackers, Mohamed Atta, in particular is an extreme personality study in repressed sexuality, narcissism, and sociopathic hatred of others. He cannot smile or enjoy life in the slighest so that when he eats food he mutters to himself how boring and tedious the task of eating is. Everyone who knew him, even people who shared in his beliefs, found him an obnoxious presence. Sullen, brooding, and controlling, he made the hairs on people's neck bristle whenever he entered a room. In spite of his fastidious religious adherence, he takes to the mysterious and disturbing desire to wear eye mascara. I'll let you decided if he is \\"ordinary\\" or not. In any event, Atta, like the others, is misogynistic; women are shunned and held in contempt. The total sum picture you get of these hijackers is a bunch of malignant malcontents who need an extreme cause to be a vehicle for their personal frustration and deeply-set anti-social tendencies.<br /><br />For an excellent companion book to better understand the types of personalities who get drawn to extreme forms of belief, I highly recommend Eric Hoffer's slim masterpiece The True Believer.mpt.

He shows, to name some examples, how our names affect our career paths; how abortion and the crime rate are related; how a man used his cunning to humiliate the Klu Klux Klan rather than rely on conventional methods; how easy it is to identify the role of public school teachers when they help their students cheat on standardized tests; why drug dealing is only lucrative for the dealers at the top of the pyramid; the myth that real estate agents are looking for our best interests.<br /><br />The book, co-authored by Stephen J. Dubner, is  breezy and anecdotal, which is an effective format for presenting a lot of sociological trends without being dry or losing the scintillating reportage in dense prose.<br /><br />The lesson of this book is that we should be leery of trusting society's common assumptions or common wisdom. In other words, the book encourages us to keep our mind alert and break out of the mold in the way we see things. By looking at social trends with a fresh eye, the book succeeds at making economic trends a fun, adventurous endeavor.<br /><br />If I were to criticize the book, it would be that it is too short. It's barely 200 pages and if you take out the blank chapter pages, the charts, the lists, and so on, it's really closer to 150 pages. Because the material is so current and topical, the method of \\"freakonomics\\" presented here would make a good format for a monthly magazine. My guess is that there will be many sequels.	2005-05-06

By all accounts it is his masterpiece. It even as a style of its own, a compression and economy that Doestoevsky isn't known for. Premise: A cuckolded widow visits the lover of his recently deceased wife to torment him. He never lets his betrayer know that he knows or doesn't know about the affair. Much of the torment is rooted in the betrayer's uncertainty. For pyschological drama, if you like this kind of discomfiting intensity, where the main character seems an inch away from descending into complete madness, you might also like The Horned Man by James Lasdun and Contempt by Alberto Moravia.	2005-04-15

He doesn't have any easy answers but he does probe brilliantly into possible causes of the genocide that hit Rwanda in April 1994. Using the oral history of many eye witnesses, Gourevitch weaves story telling and history, especially the role of the Belgians in dividing and conquering by giving special privileges to the Tutsis, resulting in incredible resentment in the hearts of the Hutus who are 85% of Rwanda's population.<br /><br />There are compelling anecdotes and news stories covered here that as amazing and shocking as they are were never covered in the American press. This alone makes the book valuable. For example, he shows the alleged role of a naturalized American citizen, a minister from Rwanda, who used his religious authority to snare hundreds of Tutsis in his church before they were killed. We learn of this minister's guilty conscience and the FBI's pursuit of him in Texas and Mexico. There are scenarios covered in this book that could make a movie.<br /><br />Ultimately what ties this book together, a lucid narrative of human evil and the history of political exploitation, is Gourevitch's refusal to surrender to despair and nihilism. He keeps his hope in our humanity by remembering that Hutu girls in a Catholic school would not separate themselves from the Tutsi girls when the Hutu killers demanded they be separated before a killing. The Hutu girls saw themselves as humans first, and if the killers were going to slaughter it would have to be all the girls, which, sadly, is what happened. This act of courage on the part of the Hutu girls provides a burning torch of hope for Gourevitch who writes about this tragic part of history with great humanity.	2005-04-14

The author Frankfurt does an excellent job of showing how we take for granted B.S. as it pervades us like a fog. He makes a clear distinction early on between B.S. and lies. The latter is a precise contradiction of fact to deceive. B.S. is something more grand, large-scale, insidious, and devilish. It is, at its very essence, Frankfurt writes on page 34, an indifference to truth in general, or to use his words, the way things are. We are lax with language and lazy with our craft of articulating our world so we rely on B.S. to describe our condition. B.S. is a form of slop in this sense. Worse, we often rely on B.S., hyperbole and exaggeration and fale analogy for example, for all manners of self-aggrandizement. But the B.S. artist has an even larger agenda, to draw you into a world or abyss of complete B.S. and make you beholden to his relativistic world where he has a low bar of accountability. Franfurt shows the rhetorical strategies employed by the B.S. artist, sloppy analogies, gross exaggeration, vague language, cant, sanctiminious pieties, and so on. He also shows the conditions in our modern society that prove a rich breeding ground for B.S. Finally, he draws much of his definition from a book by Max Black titled the Prevalence of Humbug.	2005-04-05

He takes you into the heart of modern day Afghanistan, for example, in his story \\"Death Defier,\\" where an American journalist, haunted by family demons, appears to be a courageous photographer of truth on one hand and a man with a death wish on the other. In \\"Aral,\\" his story that more than the others ventures into exposition and polemic, a nihilistic KGB officer lectures an American biologist UN worker about the \\"fat souls\\" of Americans who, for all their platitudes, know nothing of real suffering before subjecting the woman to a little trial of her own. In \\"The Ambassador's Son\\" a rogue narrates his licentious exploits and the manner in which he corrupts a Christian missionary.<br /><br />Amazingly, these stories can be peeled layer upon layer for their psychological depth while at the same time they percolate with the buzz of the chaos that we read about in the daily newspapers and blogs. A great achievement.	2005-02-28

Her speech, based on her book Bad Leadership, was precise and purposeful. Not surprisingly, the book contains her precise language and her purpose, which is to show us how leadership, even when in the hands of well-intentioned people, can go wrong. She first argues that too many of us, inundanted with optimistic, often business-oriented books about leadership, assume, erroneously, that leadership is somehow synonymous with goodness and virtue. To the contrary, Kellerman argues, leadership goes wrong more often than not. In what appears to be a reverse pyramid from benign to malignant, Kellerman catalogs the seven deadly sins of leadership: 1. incompetence 2. rigidity 3. intemperance 4. callousness 5. corruption 6. insularity 7. evil.<br /><br />She gives historical (Hitler) accounts and more contemporary (Rudolph Giuliani, Howell Raines) to illustrate her definitions of bad leadership.<br /><br />She concludes by prescribing corrective measures. Her book is invaluable in that for us to fully grasp good leadership we must first comprehend its antithesis. A negative definition of leadership in all of its facets is a necessary nudge in the right direction.	2005-02-03

Told from the perspective of a neurotic egotist, the narrator accounts how he \\"sacrificed\\" his literary writing career to debase himself in the tawdry task of writing screenplays so that he can afford to lavish his wife with a bigger more opulent living quarters. The narrator convinces himself that not only does his wife not appreciate his \\"sacrifice,\\" but that she  no longer loves him. It's horrifying to read this narcissist's account of his marital disintegration because you begin to realize that he is projecting his own lack of love toward his wife (a pefectly fine, loving woman) and you realize that he is so emotionally arrested that he is incapable of loving anyone. Further, a close reading reveals that the narrator never sacrificed his writing career for his wife's opulent tastes, but rather is debasng his writing talents for his own greedy materialistic acquistion.<br /><br />Many see Moravia's novel as the quintessential example of \\"modernism,\\" the movement that emphasizes the human limitation for self-understanding and the understanding of others. Also, the novel explores Freudian themes of projection, paranoia, and the powers of the unconscious.<br /><br />The novel is fast-paced save for a few chapters where the writer and director indulge in long-winded discussions about the mythical exposition of their film but overall the novel is a real page-turner full of suspense and psychological realism.<br /><br />If you enjoy this suspensful novel told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator, I recommend Asylum by Patrick McGrath,  Despair by Vladimir Nabokov, and The Horned Man by James Lasdun.	2004-12-26

Here are some highlights that make Naked a must-read:<br /><br />1. Get Your Ya-Ya's Out--a merciless profile of his crabby grandmother and the power she held over the household when infirmity required she move in with Sedaris' immediate family. The acrimonious conflict between the grandmother and Sedaris' mother is juicy and hilarious.<br /><br />2. Planet of the Apes--chronicles Sedaris' hitchhiking escapades, some of which are so dramatic and dangerous that a film could be adapted to these adventures.<br /><br />3. The Incomplete Quad--to get a room and board discount from the university, Sedaris agrees to room and care for a roommate, a college girl who suffers from quadriplegia. Her physical limitations and life of rejection cause her to be Sedaris' cynical hitchhiking soulmate. The two travel together throughout the country, as \\"husband and wife,\\" Sedaris the upstanding husband standing by his lady's side as he languishes in her wheelchair. They use this ruse to pique the sympathy of strangers and become inflated with pride and arrogance as they dupe the public.<br /><br />4. C.O.G. (Child of God)--at fifty pages and comprised of three parts, this is perhaps Sedaris' strongest essay in the collection. He describes mifits who ride the bus across the country, a strange middle-aged man who lives with his mother whom  Sedaris meets while working at an apple processing plant in Oregon, and the C.O.G. a born-again amputee (right of a Flannery O'Conner short story) who suffers from alcoholism, flatulence, and a dream, contrary to his self-proclaimed piety, of making materialistic riches.	2004-12-23

For example, here are some favorite specimens that are featured under Lanham's magnifying glass:<br /><br />1. Happy Mondays--overbearing, needy bovine office workers with \\"overly earnest or maternal natures.\\"<br />2. Office Lichens--needy geeks who are dead weight at the office and make their co-workers work harder to make-up for their sloth and incompetence.<br />3. TGIFs--emotionally retarded males who read Maxim and impose their obnoxious, adolescent masculinity on everyone in the office.<br />4.

Here's what I like about Angels and Demons:<br /><br />1. Great handling of religious and scienfitic history, especially the way they are integrated into the plot. You actually learn something and in a way that is never boring or feels forced to the novel's plot lines.<br /><br />2. Great research. You can tell you're in the hands of a super smart, assured author who knows his stuff.<br /><br />3. Great pacing and suspense.<br /><br />4. The book experience is like sitting back and watching a glorious three-hour movie.<br /><br />Here's what I don't like:<br /><br />1. Cliche, somewhat thin, predictable characters. For example, one of the chief scientists goes around in a wheelchair. This familiar wheelchair device has been used in James Bond and other spy novels.<br /><br />2. The main character is such an Everyman that he is almost bland and boring.<br /><br />But for suspense novel, this is probably the best of its kind. I read it with no shame.	2004-12-05

We are, Zengotita argues,  so self-absorbed, so obsessed with our own flattery, so hell-bent on the creation of our own perverse sense of celebrity that we have lost the true measure of greatness. For example, he argues that we can no longer aspire to great heroism because truly heroic figures are no longer relevant in our media world. Heroism, which requires devotion, sacrifice, imagination, and mythos, has been replaced with counterfeit celebrity that makes \\"heroism\\" appealing only when it's a consumer product. Literalism, self-aggrandizement, being pandered to by an onslaught of advertisers in every media form, and the resulting delusion that we are always the center of the universe makes us into pseudo celebrities so that we have no room in our consciousness for the real heroes of the world. He makes a great case for the fact that we have become, thanks to the media, more like full-time actors than real humans. All of us, he says, have learned from television \\"method acting,\\" so that a media person could stick a microphone in front of any Average Joe and that Average Joe would be able to give a polished interview. We're all competing to be the star in a world of wannabe celebrities.<br /><br />He does a good job of showing how television gives us a God's-eye view of everything so that we have a delusion of omniscience and this false power fuels our delusions of grandeur. Additionally, this God's-eye view spoils us so that we can't live in stillness and see life in the here and now but only media's cheap, hyped representations of life.<br /><br />This unhealthy quest for god-hood, he shows, has taken shape in the popularity of Reality TV shows, which feed our sense of entitlement, self-pity, and our narcissistic wish to be recognized over others.<br /><br />By showing how our inability to embrace true heroes connects to our obsession with making ourselves into pseudo heroes, Zengotita has found an original, sometimes funny, and always profound way to make us look at the way the media is shaping our psyches and our souls.heroes connects to our obsession with making ourselves into pseudo heroes, Zengotita has found an original, sometimes funny, and always profound way to make us look at the way the media is shaping our psyches and our souls.	2004-11-21

The answer, wonderfully, is a clear NO. Thankfully, America (The Book) is a mock social studies text book, rife with all sorts of charts, graphs, and photos, that looks at American democracy, in all of its absurdity and mutations, through the scabrous lens of irony. In nine chapters, America covers the founding of America, the history of the presidency, the machinations of Congress, the rules of the Judicial Branch, the tomfoolery of campaigns and elections, the profound \\"vulgarian\\" elements of the media, and, God bless us all, the \\"future of our democracy.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the same ironic sensibility informs the book that informs the TV show, so fans of The Daily Show and The Onion should love this book.	2004-11-18

With supreme assuredeness, Wolcott lambastes the minions at Fox News and other cable news pundits. So why only four stars? Because there's an intensity to Wolcott's language that is his greatest strength as a writer but that asserts limits for book-length works. After being razzle-dazzled by Wolcott's delicious display of scathing critique, the exercise becomes redundant. He deftly defines \\"the attack poodle\\" in the book's opening, then proceeds to paint every media figure according to his definition so that the exercise, after 150 pages or so, becomes predictable and a bit monotonous. Still it is a pleasure to watch a master of language do his work, so please let me end this review on a positive note: Wolcott is always worth reading. For a companion piece about the way the media is the lapdog of politicians, you might pick up the equally deft and more complex critique Sore Winners by John Powers.	2004-11-06

Lindbergh, who in The Plot Against America, uses his cheap jingoistic rhetoric, convincing the American public during the 1940 presidential election that he loves America more than FD Roosevelt. Championing himself with fear and a friendship with Adolph Hitler, he creates a poisonous atmosphere for all of America, not the least of which are the Jews who come under heated persecution, isolation, and discrimination.<br /><br />What's most poignant about this novel is the way Roth has--either consciously or unconsciously--drawn parallels between his fictional creation of Lindbergh with George W. Bush. Both are fear-mongers, both use either/or fallacies in their speeches (\\"You're either for us or against us.\\"), both resort to demagoguery, both rely on unconvincing macho posturing, both stubbornly ignore the valuable advice of their political advisors, both are intoxicated by their own sense of destiny. Thus we're faced with the question: Did Roth write this novel as a subversive way of critiquing George W. Bush? I honestly don't know, but this question and the exploration of the manner in which a president's dysfunctional qualities have a rippling effect on the country make this an urgent topic.<br /><br />So why only four stars, not five? Sorry to say, there's some filler here. At 362 pages, the novel is paced too slowly. There are peripheral characters, a World War II vet amputee for example, who get too much time here. The novel should have come in a lean, mean 200 pages. For an example of one of Roth's more gem-etched taut novels, take a look at his masterpiece The Dying Animal.	2004-11-01

He explains that the obesity rate, which was always stable at around 25%, shot up to 60-65% in the 1980s and he provides a coherent narrative, packed with well-documented statistics, to show the major forces of that obesity spike. He shows that Earl Butz, Secretary of Agriculture for Nixon, was a key player in making the environment conducive to our being fat. In the 1970's, under Butz's charge, farmers grew more corn to make a cheaper form of sugar, High Frutose Corn Syrup, which metabolizes in far more dangerous ways than regular sucrose. Secondly, he made a deal with Malaysia, allowing them to export palm oil, also called \\"hog's lard,\\" to America. Palm oil turns out to be a form of trans fat which, with a shelf life of infinity, clogs our arteries. The other enviromental condition that led us down a path of obesity was the Super-Size-Me Philosophy spawned in the fast-food industry. Shrewd business men who wanted greater profits preyed on our psychology and created a new way to make us fat:<br /><br />1. Disguise our piggishness by making huge bags of fries rather than shaming us into buying two bags.<br />2. Combine low-profit (hamburgers) with high-profit (soda and fries) foods to create a \\"value meal.\\"<br />3. Emphasize price and value over taste and presentation, which they found to their giddiness, made us eat MORE.<br />4. Banish the shame of gluttony. Create a culture where it's cool to overeat in the same way that it's cool to drive a big SUV and be a huge, conspicuous consumer.<br /><br />What makes Critser's analysis so refreshing is that even though he points at the environmental hurdles we must face if want to be fit and trim, he always encourages us to educate ourselves and to take responsibility for what we put into our mouths. Reading his book is the first step in that education.education.	2004-10-25

The stories, as she confesses herself, tend to be longish, 20-30 pages for the most part. In the back of the book the writers give their accounting of the stories, explaining how the stories were set into motion and even touch on some important themes. Eight of the twenty stories, almost half, were chosen from The New Yorker. Its dominance as a source of \\"best\\" stories is somewhat disconcerting. Can one magazine really be that good? I don't know. I admire Lorrie Moore so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. In any event, the anthology's contents follow:<br /><br />1. What You Pawn I Will Redeem by Sherman Alexie<br />2.

It is a well developed profile of a bullying husband and his effete, sympathetic, girlish wife and the story is haunting in the way it renders a dysfunctional couple and the wife's decision to choose a familiar hell over the fear of the unknown. Her imprisonment is all too common and explores universal themes of the way people acclimate themselves to a quiet, seething domestic inferno.

Here are some highlights:<br /><br />1. \\"Envy\\" by Kathryn Chetkovich. In this autobiographical essay, Chetkovich, an obscure short story writer, chronicles her romance to Jonathan Franzen who with his novel The Corrections becomes a publishing phenon, making her consumed with guilt for experiencing, against her own will, envy. She combines narrative with a sharp analysis of the causes and effects of envy in her life and shows how the condition is a universal one.<br /><br />2. \\"Caught\\" by Jonathan Franzan. Franzan writes about his high school years as a misfit trying to find belonging among the hipsters by challenging authority and the icons of authority. An amazing feat, he writes a comical narrative combined with a penetrating analysis of the pitfalls of adolescence.<br /><br />3. \\"A Sudden Illness\\" by Laura Hillenbrand. The author of the famous nonfiction book Seabiscuit which was made into a hit film, the author traces the origins of a consuming fatigue disease for which no real specific diagnosis can be found. The result is a lack of sympathy from others and a heroic struggle for which she somehow, as a sort of miracle, wrote Seabiscuit.<br /><br />4. \\"The Last Americans\\" by Jared Diamond. Diamond compares our piggish, consumer-obsessed country with other fallen empires and refutes the fallacies and misconceptions that afflict us: our dismissal of the environment as a crucial part of our survival; our blind faith in technlogy to cure all our woes; our tendency to demonize environmentalists as extremist crackpots who are overstating their catastrophic predictions.<br /><br />5. \\"Against Cool\\" by Rick Moody. Denying that he is cool, Moody, in a sneaky rhetorical technique, proves just how cool he is by giving us a thorough, definitive, and historical definition of cool.<br /><br />6. \\"Arrow and Wound\\" by Mark Slouka. Somehow Slouka takes an ambitious, philosophical theme of human suffering, mortality, and our intuitive ability to prepare for our agony and makes the theme both accessible and readable, quoting Kafka, Dostoesvsky, and the poet Jaroslav Seifert and weaves their philosphical ruminations into a frightening and bizarre narrative he experienced.r />6. \\"Arrow and Wound\\" by Mark Slouka.

Wolff is too profound a writer to rely on gimmicks of any kind. Here are some highlights of the collection:<br /><br />\\"The Rich Brother\\": Two brothers, one rich and arrogant, the other a poor drifter, both blame each other for their problems when in fact both are blind to their own pride and their own neediness which makes them need to rival against the other as a distraction from their empty lives.<br /><br />\\"Desert Breakdown, 1968\\": A spoiled brat, now married to a beautiful pregnant woman, has fantasies of leaving his wife to be a single hedonist. He also loathes his parents who have spoiled and enabled him all his life. His delusions catch up with him in a way that I'll leave for the reader to discover in this excellent story.<br /><br />\\"The Missing Person\\": A spiritual cousin to the drifting brother in \\"The Rich Brother,\\" Leo is a waif afraid of women who sublimates his fears by joining the priesthood where, in an ironic twist, he meets a Trickster and becomes a corrupt hustler upon which, through too many twists of events to chronicle here, he finds his real self.<br /><br />\\"Say Yes\\": A naive young house wife realizes that her husband is a racist and that racism can't be compartmentalized. His racist views contaminate all other aspects of his personality and he must therefore re-invent himself or suffer his wife's contempt and perhaps worse.<br /><br />These stories are mostly gems, wrought with irony, tales of folly, people's misguided attempts at redemption, predatory tricksters wreaking havoc on the lives of others.

Thus it's not surprising that our disaffected narrator, Michel, feels nothing after his father's death and uses his inheritance to engage in sex tours throughout Thailand where, as he explores the depths of the salacious and skewers his traveling companion philistines, he throws the reader little nihilistic aphorisms about the emptiness of life. His misanthropic quips were amusing for the first sixty pages or so, but as a 260-page novel, I found the book to be a bit flat. How many pages do you need to tell the world that life is a brutal bore punctuated with some sexual respite? How long can you listen to a narrator talk about how alienated he is from his fellow humans, who come across as pretentious philistines, impostors, and clich&eacute;-loving, soulless bureaucrats, and religious fanatics? The rant should have been relegated to a novella, a taut hundred pages, but the author pads the plot with a mundane business enterprise that dilutes the novel's pungency. For a more fiery, intellectually complex treatment of nihilism and the ecstasy of sex, I recommend Philip Roth's Dying Animal.	2004-08-13

He shows that our archaic systems of intelligence are not changing at a radical enough speed to adapt to our enemies' tactics; he shows that Osama bin Laden, contrary to charges of being a fringe crackpot, is a beloved hero in the mainstream Islamic world who has tapped into their long-held, festering grievances and in doing so cites a thorough listing of those grievances and shows how American foreign policy contributes to that anger; he shows how America is in denial and is not gearing up for this war in proportion to the threat; he shows specifically how Al Qaeda's operating tactics are unbeatable, especially with our sluggish, outmoded bureaucracies responding at a snail's pace.<br /><br />Particularly sobering, is his rendering of the manner in which Al Qaeda has created an atmosphere of chaos and panic in our self-defense strategy. He writes: \\"By treating each threat as a real possibility, we try to protect everything and end up protecting very little.\\" He then quotes a Chinese philosopher who once said, \\"And when he prepares everywhere, he will be weak everywhere.\\"<br /><br />What's particularly devastating about this book is that the author, a CIA agent, is not writing from an anti-American, left-wing, or partisan point of view. He's a realist telling Americans we're in a war that has to be fought on many fronts, diplomatic and on the battlefront, none of which we're doing. To the contrary, we've wasted enormous resources and lost international good-will in our debacle of a war in Iraq, which, the author shows, has simply been a brilliant recruiting tool for Osama bin Laden as he amasses more and more disciples.<br /><br />This is compelling reading, written in pungent, vigorous prose, a must-read from an insider who isn't afraid to give us bold diagnosis of our perilous condition.sn't afraid to give us bold diagnosis of our perilous condition.	2004-07-30

Packer's characters break out of any kind of preconceived molds and faced with Groupthink, pressures to conform, and the patronization and condescension of liberal whites, these characters become infuriated by the stupidity that surrounds them. The style of the stories is intensely realistic, often satirical, bitter, nihilistic. At the same time Packer brings a deep humanity, complexity, and sympathy to her cast of misfits, all who search for belonging and never find it.<br />In \\"Brownies\\" African-American girls stir a brouhaha with a dubious charge of having heard a racial epithet uttered by the white Brownies. The story in many ways is a funny and disturbing exploration of Groupthink whereby the black Brownies never really heard the epithet but get caught up in the self-righteousness and mission of their revenge. In \\"Every Tongue Shall Confess\\" a cross-eyed, homely lady, Clareese, plays by the rules, reads her Bible, and works hard as a nurse, only to be exploited by her church deacons who use her as a door mat. We cringe as we watch Clareese sink deeper and deeper into loneliness. In \\"Our Lady of Peace\\" a young woman takes on teaching in a public school in order to change nihilistic, lawless high school children, but in a reversal, the children make her a nihilistic misanthropist. The teacher Lynnea Davis not only begins to despise the children, but the teachers she works with. In the \\"Ant of the Self\\" a precocious teenage boy named Spurgeon must face the dilemmas of having an alcoholic bully of a father who drags his son to the Million-Man March where Spurgeon, the innocent party, is berated by rhetorically-inflamed black men to respect and love and appreciate his father for taking him to such a great event when in fact his hustler of a father simply took him to the march in order to sell a bunch of stolen exotic birds. In \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" a young girl runs away from home where her overly pious aunt subjects her to the abuses of a dysfunctional, abusive church. However, running away to Atlanta to find her mother, the young girl discovers that the secular world-full of pimps, hustlers, and libertines-offers no refuge.<br />For all the diversity of these stories, we can see Packer's general themes-her animosity against Groupthink, her loathing of convenient stereotypical thinking, her objection to the use of religion and false piety in order to bully others, her disdain for the manner in which clich&eacute;s offer people false solutions and self-aggrandizement.

The world in question is Puritanism, specifically Scottish Calvinism in its most virulent form. The Calvinists in the novel, Robert Wringhim and his son of the same name, are scabrous parasites, full of religious cant and envy, who plot to takeover the inheritance of the Colwan household through murder, an act they rationalize because they are, they believe, already predestined to be saved so no sin can bring them damnation and secondly because the murder victim is an evil sinner who, in their mind, deserves to be killed. Thus we have the profile of those who commit evil even while convinced of their own piety, a very relevant theme in today's world of quasi-spiritual leaders who foment violence in the name of their faith.<br />The novel is divided in three parts, ninety pages of The Editor's Narrative, a third-person account of the rivalry and murder; the 130-page first-person Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Sinner; and, thirdly, the 10-page epilogue, told again from the Editor.<br />This is a very disturbing, funny, frightening novel, especially since its murderous characters are so believable. However, I can only give the novel four stars, not five, because the Confessions section, at 130 pages, is too long. It's unbearable and repetitive to observe Wringham's rhetorical excesses and lame justification and skewed point of view for so long. His evil is clearly and convincingly established and to hear him bloviate about how good he is and how evil everyone else is for over a hundred pages becomes tiresome.  However, I don't wish to sway anyone from reading one of the best novels I've ever read about the role piety and self-rectitude play in enabling people to wreak evil and havoc on the world.	2004-05-29

Now comes Perrotta's novel The Little Children, which in many ways is even more ambitious and relevant social commentary than his entertaining novel Election. Like the stories of John Cheever, Perrotta's novel shows that there is no suburban Eden. It is rather a place seething with infantile lusts, narcissism, arrested emotional development, and all kinds of tomfoolery that keep the novel from taking itself too seriously. For all the serious subject matter, this novel departs from Cheever in terms of tone. Whereas Cheever deals with suburban ennui with somberness and subtle irony, Perrotta prefers the comic romp. We see Todd, unhappily married to a wife who dotes on her child at the expense of giving her husband any attention, leaving him sexually starved. We see Sarah, from another marriage, who, failing as a professor of women's studies and working in a Starbuck's, marries for reasons of financial security and convenience and ends up having an affair with Todd whom she meets at the park playground where many adults take their kids to play. Perhaps the most grotesque character who comes close to being a cartoon figure is busy-body Larry, a macho retired cop who, bored with his early retirement, intrudes on the life of a released sex criminal, becoming in many ways more of a nuisance than the pariah who infests the neighborhood. The scenes where Larry pressures the namby-pamby Todd to play hardcore park football with Larry's Marine buddies is hilarious and gives the novel, which is so full of many sobering themes about dysfunctional suburbia, great comic relief. As many have said, The Little Children is about adults who wear a mask of bravado and assuredness to conceal that behind all their middle-class trappings and domestic comforts, they are little more than frightened children who, without a moral compass, have lost their way.dysfunctional suburbia, great comic relief.

Gatsby is a classic example. Having read the novel ten times over the last twenty years, I have enjoyed a certain distance and just as importantly the opportunity to compare different impressions at different stages of my life. The result is that I am even more impressed with the novel than all the annoying hype and commotion that continues to follow the novel would allow me to have. Without boring you about all the themes that have been hashed over and over, I would like to point out that there is a great question the novel asks us: Why does the narrator Nick have sympathy for Gatsby while loathing all the other chasers of the American Dream? It seems that Gatsby is a contradictory fellow, part ruthless dreamer zealously selling his soul to afford himself the trappings of fame, popularity, and glory. However, Gatsby, unlike the other ambitious characters in this novel, has a certain innocence and vulnerbility. Also, he is a true believer in his own delusion that if he can live a life a wealth and afford parties, he will overcome his childhood limitations and win the love of others. It's his craving of others' love that makes him sympathetic. In a way, he's a spiritual cousin of Citizen Kane who, for all his gaudy possessions, simply wanted the unconditional love represented by &quot;Rosebud&quot; on his sled, the embodiment of childhood belonging. Nick the narrator has the sensitivity to see this wounded child in Gatsby and reserves judgment against him.<br />Gatsby's pathological hunger for attention and popularity reminds me of all the people who go on Reality TV shows, hoping to promote themselves and be seen by all, grabbing their fifteen minutes of fame even as they debase themselves in various types of tomfoolery that showcase America's blind ambition and back-stabbing competition. Many years earlier, Fitzgerald saw how dangerous it was to blindly embrace American images of success without self-knowledge and without a moral code to keep us sane and he wrote about this theme so elegantly in Gatsby, a masterpiece that transcends all our limiting preconceptions we bring to it.ompetition.

Weil uses credible science to backup his assertions, never offers fads or extremes, and best of all, he writes in an intelligent, personal voice, using phrases like &quot;I'd like you to . . .&quot; which give the book an intimate feel, as if you were consulting with a personal nutritionist. Further, he has the wisdom to see that improving our health is not based on micromanagement, tweaking one thing or another, but rather is a holistic approach requiring daily walks, bringing beauty into our lives with something as simple as having fresh flowers on the table, and meditating or doing yoga. While I don't embrace everything Weil suggests, I have embraced the gist of his message and, more specifically, have radically changed my diet. No longer eating refined sugar and hydrogenated oils, I have lost 40 pounds  in the last five months. A great companion book that is compatible with Weil's philosophy on many levels and which has also helped me is The Philosopher's Diet by Richard Watson.	2004-04-12

Yes, there is a rogue great white shark featured in this nonfiction account of an adolsescent great white that apparently went crazy and attacked bathers and swimmers off the East Coast during the summer of 1916, but you have to read a lot of padding in this book, long expository segments on man vs. nature, the industrial revolution, the drum beats of World War I, back stories of people who were directly and indirectly in contact with the shark. The writing is excellent, but the book seems at least twice as long as at it would have been had the author focused on the shark attacks. It seems so many books are in reality essays that literary agents and publishers inflate into books. If you don't want all the peripheral information, what I'm calling padding, you may be disappointed. In the end, though, I have to give the book four stars because the prose style is sharp and the author recreates the harrowing shark attack scenes with lucid clarity and suspense.	2004-03-22

Reminding me of Flannery O'Conner and Lorrie Moore, these stories are tied together by the theme of belonging. In the opening story, for example, Brownies, the African American girls, members of the Brownies, want to avenge the white girl Brownie members at a campsite not so much because they feel they have been genuinely offended or because they feel the need to avenge anyone but because they need a rite of passage that will test their loyalty to each other. In the second story, Every Tongue Shall Confess, a skinny, somewhat homely nurse does everything she can to be a good Christian: she sings in the choir, she witnesses, she submits to the church deacons' patriarchal rules, she lives a life of chastity . . . yet for all her good works, she remains a misfit, a lonely outsider who wonders if there is any power in her life of piety and she begins to wonder, watching the hypocrites in her church, if she will ever find a sense of belonging. In the third story, both tragic and funny, Our Lady of Peace, a young woman who is in desperate in need of job resorts to teaching high school English at a tough inner city school in Baltimore and she suffers incredible isolation and burnout as she sinks further and further in her failure to reach her students to the point that she surrenders, however temporarily, to the powers of nihilism. All these stories point to the outsider looking for a place to belong is a common theme in these stories, which are told with complexity, humanity, irony, and deep humor. These wonderful stories have that quality that demands that they be reread, a sign of the highest literary art.	2004-03-18

Jonas, the main character, is a twelve-year-old boy who, like Jim Carey in the Truman Show, must re-evaluate what freedom is and act on his courage to change his destiny. A society that seeks to remain ignorant in the name of a utopia is a great theme that is explored effectively in this novel. For some companion pieces, I recommend H.G.

Jones' title story, reading like an autobiographical essay, is about a man who tries to make that return and salvage his life and save it from nihilism. Unlike Krebs in Hemingway's &quot;Soldier's Home,&quot; the narrator finds at least some kind of love (he loves his dogs) as he courageously lives on with his deep psychic war scars.

Mr. Parker has a lovely daughter who arouses our narrator's senses but merely titilates him. One mishap after another makes the narrator feel obliged to stay longer in the town even though he keeps reminding us--and himself--that he wants to break free and begin his exotic travels. His major impediment to leaving, he would have us believe, is Mr. Parker, a brutal, intimidating man who demands that the narrator do all sorts of chores and odd-jobs for him, but gradually we realize that the narrator is afraid to adventure out of his comfort zone and would rather live in the relative prison of Mr. Parker's campsite tent, with its severely limiting rules, than inch his way into the flux of the vital, real, outside world. Thus the novel's theme is the conflict between our need to branch out and challenge ourselves vs. our tendency to roll up into the fetal position and die a spiritual death in our tiny world of comfort and familiarity. This theme is further explored in Mills' subsequent novel Three to See the King.	2004-03-11

Human Depravity	This fantastic nonfiction account, reading like a page-turning thriller novel, of the great World Fair in Chicago renders a blood-curdling profile of serial killer H.H. Holmes who, like a spider waiting for its prey, lurked in the background of the smoky, pungent World Fair, as naive, star-struck women visisted Chicago, only to be victimized by this monster. In alternating chapters, we see the ambitious Daniel Burnham who became obsessed with erecting the World Fair as a testament to American greatness. Some reviewers have criticized the book's structure, alternating the episodes of serial killer H.H. Holmes with World Fair designer Daniel Burnham, arguing that the two stories are hardly related. I believe they error. The purpose of setting up these two stories, one of a thoroughly chilling man, the embodiment of evil, and Burnham, a man trying to bring splendor and light to the world, is to show the range of good and evil in the human animal. I'm  reminded of the Tower of Babel, the attempt to become like gods through human achievement, a quest embodied by Burnhan. The author is in a subtle way warning us to never become too intoxicated or giddy with our great man-made achievements in the realm of technlogy and science because there is this horrible thing called human depravity, which is the flipside of our ambitious nature.	2004-03-05

The European dove approach to everything, however, makes Europe heavily dependent on America for its protection and stability, costing Americans our tax dollars and bloodshed even as Europeans use the money they save from not investing in military technlogy to enjoy shorter work weeks, longer vacations and other socialist perks. Thus not only does Europe piggy-back on American tax money and military might, it has the audacity to condemn Americans as being a bunch of hot-tempered cowboys, even as they wallow in their peacnik delusions and cowardice. Kagan shows with very subtle prose that Europeans embrace an outdated peacenick approach that is rooted in selfisness and delusion and that forces America to be the only realistic power, a situation that ultimately is disadvantageous for America. Kagan would prefer that Europe use more military might in sustaining world stability and not rely so much on America, making the US the world police. What's impressive about Kagan's polemic is that he's never heavy-handed or overtly accusatory in his treatment of Europe. Rather, he makes his case with a certain sympathy and diplomacy, sympathizing with Europe for having been so devastated by World War II but ultimately wanting Europe to carry its weight when it comes to flexing military muscle.	2004-03-03

The real business of this absurd (I mean that as a compliment), allegorical novel is to poke fun at the human  need for safety, for mother, for the womb, all embodied by the pancake house. Tom's quest for a mother in the metaphorical sense compels him to invite his colleagues at this pancake emporium every year or so where they try to mend the their bruised egos, a quest that backfires. Antrim's major conflict in the novel is the human drive for safety vs. our utter sense of helplessness in this metaphysical parody, which showcases Antrim's brilliant writing skills. Why only four stars? Because after about 100 pages, I grew a bit tired of the metaphysical explorations. Similar themes are pursued with far more intensity and efficacy in my opinion in Antrim's 20-page essay, &quot;I Bought a Bed,&quot; published in Best American Essays 2003.	2004-02-05

Salvation, they argue, is a transformation of the soul, being liberated from self-absorption, which has little to do with embracing any kind of orthodoxy, a Nicene creed, or some canned mantra. While I'm not sure where I stand on the issue of the afterlife, I found the book helpful in showing that biblical interpretation is a sort of Rorschach test. The God we pull out of the Bible often reflects our own biases and temperaments. For example, the authors say that the more mature they become, the more they see the complexities of human behavior, the more they replace their anger with love, the less they can believe in eternal damnation. Thus it is that the God that grows inside their hearts contradicts the notion of eternal perdition. As a result, they have evolved their interpretation of the Bible to exclude the idea of an eternal concentration camp for nonbelievers. They use several Bible passages to support their views and argue that not all scripture is equal. Scripture that defines grace, they assert, has more weight than scripture that defines God as a wrath-hungry Father displeased with his children. If I had to fault the book, the authors are too inclined to pick and choose from the Bible to come up with the God of their experience. As a result, the God of the Bible seems a bit sugar-coated and almost seems like wishful thinking on their part. On the other hand, I do appreciate a theology that rejects the idea of eternal damnation, which seems just as extreme, at the opposite pole, as does the candy-coated version of God.	2004-02-01

Because the plot is so well known through the famous film version, I will focus on the prose style. Leonard makes the prose look easy but it's not. It's really a sort of jazz riff and in an interview, if I remember correctly, Leonard says jazz fuels his writing tempo. You can see the musical quality in his playful, clean, clear prose. I've also heard that many aspiring writers try to imitate Leonard's prose style yet no one can do it. For a clinic on character study through witty syntax, Get Shorty remains one of my favorite crime novels of all time.	2004-01-24

But the book, full of logical, convincing, and coherent arguments, was for me and I suppose anyone who reads the newspapers, a bit redundant. It didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know regarding the Left's weak stance on terrorism and the various obstacles that our country faces as we try to protect ourselves. Anyone who reads a modicum of news will probably not learn anything new. However, it is an effective document that backs up its sources so that you can use it when arguing with people who disagree with you.	2004-01-15

As a result, a tragic paradox has inflicted the canine world: On one hand, dogs are now regarded with higher esteem but on the other hand our unrealistic expectations result in disappointment and frustration, resulting in the neglect, abuse, and anger against dogs, many of which are abandoned. Katz isn't saying we shouldn't lavish love on dogs. Rather, he is saying we should be aware of the kind of emotional needs we're requiring our dogs to make and to perhaps not fall into the trap of overdoing our dog obsession. To make his point, he provides about a dozen in-depth profiles of dog owners, many lonely and alienated from society and shows the pressures their loneliness puts on their dogs.	2003-11-24

Books	5	13	14	N	Y	Masterpiece about the Psychology of Evil	With the page-turning suspense of the finest mystery novel, Levy, who risked his life and his sanity to write this book by descending into the bowels of evil, traces the footsteps of Daniel Pearl, a fearless, principled reporter, and not only uncovers the evil behind Pearl's murder, but probes into the psychology of evil that drives Islamisists: the way they define themselves not through a positive conception but by negation: hatred of Jews and Christians and for that matter any nonMuslim. Levy analyzes the sickness of fanaticism: the latent homosexual misogyny, the narcissism, the labyrinth of murky evil, which he describes as \\"one trap door leader to another and another . . .\\" Even more frightening, Levy shows that the pathology of hatred exists as a normal condition, nurtured by Islamic fanatics in the madrasas, which work in a symbiotic relationship with the ISI, the secret Pakistani police. In fact, Levi shows that it is Pakistan, not Iraq, which is a principal center of evil and potential apocalypse. All of Levy's revelations are rendered with profound humanity and anger at an evil that is glorified in too many parts of the world.	2003-11-15

But Bully transcends the genre. Fast-paced like a suspense novel, it is written from a standpoint of moral absolutism so that a stinging lash of condemnation is rendered against a white upper middle class community in Florida that seems to be raising teenagers with no moral compass. The true story, the murder of Bobby Kent by his peers, is brutally shown not for sensationalism but to show how the murderers had no sense of right or wrong. In other words they were completely numb to the evil they were committing. There are some highly accessible companion books that deal with the loss of today's society's moral conscience. I'll name a few: The Wilding of America by Charles Derber; For Shame by James Twitchell (sadly out of print); and The Twilight of American Culture by Morris Berman.	2003-11-15

For a more serious companion book, you might check out Thomas S. Hibbs' very accessible book Shows About Nothing: Nihilism in Popular Culture from the Exorcist to Seinfeld.<br />I give Queenan's book four stars only because the book seems to have a good 50 pages of filler.	2003-10-24

The trial, based on CaroleAnne's bogus lawsuit of sexual harassment, examines a major theme in the novel, namely America's inability, through its often bovine-minded populace, to discern between rational and cheap argumentation. Fred Tell suffers from a viable fear that the jury is too uneducated and brainwashed by unexamined emotionalism used by CaroleAnne's attorney to see through her paranoid delusions. I'll let you read the book's conclusion to see what the jury decides.<br />The themes of corporate loneliness, suffocating paranoia, and insanity, rendered so well in this book are also done well in two companion novels, Moral Hazard by Kate Jennings, and The Ignored (a horror novel, if you can believe it) by Bentley Little.	2003-10-22

His wife would prefer him to be more upbeat, socially adroit, clean, and ambitious, but Thomas' religious struggle slowly and insidiously consumes him as he forges his own \\"gospel,\\" a Book Against God, which articulates his reasons for being an unbeliever.<br />A good companion piece that covers someone losing his faith is Martin Gardner's The Flight of Peter Fromm.	2003-10-05

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	4	32	40	N	Y	Lucid Account of Theism vs. Atheism May Be Stacked	Some reviewers have criticized the author Nicholi for &quot;stacking the deck&quot; in favor of C.S. Lewis over Freud, a sort of hidden tactic Nicholi, who professes to be &quot;neutral,&quot; employs. They may be right since Lewis looks like the winner here. Lewis finds peace, love, transformation, and a good-hearted rectitude after his conversion. In contrast, Freud comes across as paranoid to all religion, especially Christianity, which Nicholi points out, was for Freud the cause of much anti-semitism he suffered. Also Freud comes across as a cranky, pompous man ranting and raving against God to his grave, a man who, for being an atheist, sure devotes a lot of energy to this God he does not believe in. Finally, Nicholi shows how Freud constantly contradicts himself when it comes to God. He is a man who embraces a conservative Moral Law for himself (though he professes a sort of hedonism for others), for example. So indeed perhaps there is a hidden subtext and/or agenda here. I don't know. The truth of it is, Nicholi has written a real page-turner here, his account lucid and even suspensful. It's rare that an author can create this effect with argumentation and dialectical reasoning.	2003-09-27

As Levison recounts his hellish jobs, we see a man too smart and too proud to subject himself to  Groupthink, &quot;team player&quot; sycophantism, sadistic, arbitrary employers, and jobs that are clearly designed to humiliate, dehumanize, and impoversih the employee.

The narrator is extremely funny. So why only three stars? Because the observational elements in the novel work (they read like essays) while the plot--a laid-off worker turning to murder for hire--was too morally repugnant for me to relax and enjoy the narrator's laughs and gags. Maybe it's just me, but it's hard for me to establish a bond with a cold-blooded murderer who happens to keep his warm humanity in reserve for the down and out working man. Another flaw--the novel's last act appears forced, a gratuitious plot line to make the novel languish toward the 178-page mark.<br />Having said this, I still like Levison. He is so smart and funny that I bought his nonfiction book, A Working Stiff's Manifesto, a satire about many of his cruddy jobs, which I look forward to reading.	2003-09-12

His gimmick, if I can use that word, is to pose as the &quot;outsider,&quot; the angst-ridden Brit, who coming to America to work for Vanity Fair, finds that his irreverent sensibilities clash with the pompous American literati. Much of this book is a chronicle of Young's self-destructive, compulsive, selfish, infantile, salacious behavior, which I suspect he orchestrated because by playing the fool he was, in effect, gathering pungent material for his book. In other words, this book is about a brilliant British graduate of Oxford (later went to Harvard) who, posing as a tough-fisted rebel, finds an effective persona for jabbing the insiders of a prominent magazine, the dangers of American democracy (he quotes Tocqueville extensively to good effect), political correctness, and the grotesque egotism of the American literati.<br />Young is an excellent writer who knows how to tell entertaining, compelling stories and this gift compensates for his less than convincing affectation as an outsider.	2003-08-21

In Beyond Belief Pagels unearths the religious meanings of The Gospel of Thomas, which emphasize inclusiveness, an Inner Light, and a less dogma-obsessed approach to Christianity than Thomas' rival, the author of The Gospel of John, who, Pagels implies, was an egotist who wanted to be Jesus' favorite, \\"most loved\\" apostle and therefore constructed the most hyperbolic version of Jesus possible, as proof that he, more than others, knew the essence of Jesus. Pagels is suggesting that the Gospels that were selected as the official canon were chosen for political reasons: The more stringent and narrow the orthodoxy, the easier to consolidate the fractions of Christians that were splintering during Christianity's early days of tumult. Thus the orthodoxy that is the basis for our present day belief, Pagels suggests, may have been rooted in clashing egos and an urgent attempt to consolidate power, but not, in the spirit of The Gospel of Thomas, to emphasize to the human race what it really means to be spiritual, to walk with God, and to be transformed by one's Inner Light.<br />This strain of Christianity that Pagels longs for seems to have survived in the literature of the Quaker writers--George Fox, Thomas Kelly, and Rufus Jones.	2003-06-15

Sam has over the years asked Roy for loans of huge sums of money to compensate for his capricious consumer habits and Roy, the benificiary of a large inheritance, has happily obliged. But as the novel unfolds, we see that Roy begins to examine his friendship with more vigor. Sam Grandy is after all emotionally undeveloped (seems like a twelve-year-old) and seems more in love with his gadgets than he is with his wife, Kristin. Roy and Sam's wife Kristin bond when they both must nurse Sam, the sufferer of a heart-attack. Through this bonding, they see themselves, and the feelings they have for each other, with more clarity and also see, with equal clearness, the noxiousness of Sam. With these new revelations, they must test where their loyalties lay. The conflict is handled well as the novel, well paced, reaches a steady climax.<br />I've read much Berger over the years and argue that this must be one of his best novels in part because it relies on less slapstick than previous efforts and instead relies on complex characters and highly ambiguous situations so that the reader is constantly amazed by the novel's twists and turns.	2003-06-12

Stanley Yelnats must unpeel the onion of his family's past (a metaphor from one of the novel's few good characters The Onion Man who serves--what else?--onions to the ailing)and reverse the legacy of inverted love, failed promises, and greed.<br />What makes Stanley, shy and fat, such a great hero, is that he learns not to pity himself for the curse that, no fault of his own, afflicts him. Instead, he finds salvation by helping Zero, one of his prison mates at the desert work camp. By teaching Zero how to read, write, and learn math, Stanley is able to free himself from self-pity and transcend the limitations that have been imposed on him.<br />Like the novel's Onion Man, Stanley becomes a giver of hope in a world of holes (gaping chasms of despair)in a mysterious masterpiece of allegorical fiction.	2003-05-29

In addition to his clear analysis of irrational mass movements, Berman shows how \\"rationalists,\\" whether they be liberal or conservative thinkers, are in great error when they try to come up with some coherent theory or absolute explanation to answer the question: \\"Why do terrorists do what they do?\\" Berman shows that there is no rational answer, no victimization that can account for such evil acts of nihilistic theater and rage. He shows that this dark impulse is aroused by several unsavory factors, egotism, a lust for death, and a fear of freedom.<br />A great companion to Terror and Liberalism is Eric Hoffer's The True Believer, which, written 50 years ago, provides a thorough analysis--often in sharply polished epigrams--of those \\"true believers\\" who follow irrational mass movements.	2003-05-16

Mostly the book is a third-person narrator putting us inside the head of seventy-year-old widower Frank Delabano whose life consists of trying to isolate himself from his neighbors and who finds refuge in his roses, which are for him a sort of redolent drug, an intoxicant that he associates with serenity and safety. The roses have an underside or a demonic side as well, for they are not real. They represent the artificial kind of sanctuary we find when were cut off from the human race. In many ways, then, Delabano is a picture of Dead Suburban Man who, unable and unwilling to connect with society, immerses himself in the false comforts of suburban life.<br />In many ways Ordinary Horror is a long essay or critique of suburbia disguised as a horror novel. Apart from the novels slow pace, which gets bogged down, especially when we must go over lengthy expositions on horticulture, this approach works, showing us, like David Lynchs film Blue Velvet, the hideous malaise that afflicts those of us who isolate ourselves in suburbia and infatuate ourselves with our own mythology of innocence.<br />If you like the theme of Modern Man Dying in the Suburbs, you might want to take a look at Thomas Bergers classic and funny novel Neighbors, which showcases Earl Keese, a spiritual cousin of Frank Delabano.	2003-04-07

We sympathize with brilliant wits like Jerry Stahl who tend to have addictive personalities because they are constantly seeking some kind of medication to soothe the soul's inevitable ache, the result of their razor-edged wit turning most harshly against themselves.	2003-03-21

We travel with him during his ascent to political and social power as he tries to downplay all the backstabbing he does to become a hot shot or what is in reality a cliche-mongering, bloviator who has no principles but can only opine in order to further his career. As with most deals with the devil, this one doesn't end the way the bargainer thought it would.

Culture is a great humming machine that slowly drips her lies and mythologies into our bloodstream. By questioning the \\"story\\" we tell ourselves, Quinn does a good job of criticizing the excesses of the Takers, his term for post-agricultural man. However, many of his points seem flawed in oversimplification, historical inaccuracy, and faulty comparison. For example, he compares everything we learn from Mother Culture to the beliefs of Nazis. Surely, Mother Culture is more complex than that. Second, his solution for our self-destructive ways is for us to go back to our pre-agricultural days (when we were Leavers), a task that would entail the suppression of our creative (and destructive) urges.  Third, Quinn hasn't sold me on his idea that man is just like all the other animals and therefore has no special place. Man is both higher and lower, more angelic and more demonic, truly exceptional and apart from the animals, contrary to Quinn. Fourth, I'm suspicious of anyone who says humans can turn back and recover some more \\"simple way of life,\\" another utopia hustle. Fifth, I'm suspicious of anything that smacks of a noble savage myth. Leavers, as he calls them, are somehow better than Takers. I suspect the Leavers were just as barbaric and bloodthirsty, if not worse, than us. Sixth, Quinns solution would result in mass starvation. Who decides who starves at this point? Seventh, his assertion that savages had no prophets seems like an unlikely oversimplification. Many so-called primitive cultures have had spiritual leaders or prophets, contrary to what he says on page 85. Eighth, he says God only became important when \\"neolithic white men showed up.\\" Another falsity. In fact, all the major religions came out of a Semitic, dark-skinned people. Ninth, contrary to his claim that Leavers had no prophets, many primitive tribes, or Leavers, were just as guilty of warring with competing tribes of different gods as are the Takers. Tenth, he doesnt do a good sell of his moral relativism\\" on page 87 Case in point: there are universal values like courage that are embraced by all cultures. What culture values cowardice and betrayal? None. So perhaps there IS A RIGHT WAY TO LIVE. And finally, after making general truths about how we become captives to lies, he slowly but surely plants his own lies, half-truths, exaggerations, and oversimplifications and makes us captives to his propaganda.

Max is effete, inept, egotistical, completely lacking in passion and intimacy. His whole life is defined by his work at an asylum for criminal patients. Stella's marriage to Max in a way is the real asylum. Tormented by passions and lusts, Stella begins a completely irrational affair with one of the patients, thus beginning a whole new kind of torture. This is a novel of extremes--extreme loneliness, extreme passion, extreme repression, extreme self-abandonment. Humans were not designed for healthy relationships, the narrator seems to be saying, and thus are doomed to a life of imprisonment whether it be that of the frosty cell of a passionless marriage or the mercurial tumult of illicit sexual passion. McGrath has created an assured, suspensful novel wrought with psychological complexity and universal themes, which makes it one of the best novels in the last ten years or so. If you enjoy this novel, I hope you will try James Lasdun's The Horned Man, another great novel about repression told by a dubious narrator, and a perfect complement to Asylum.	2003-02-16

Lasdun's stories skewer the notion of free will and seem to say that attempts to defy our destiny, our true urges, will only make those urges stronger. Thus the theme of repression and its discontents runs through all these stories, which are magical, plot-driven and told with poetic acuteness. If you like to read about characters consumed by obsessions as they face the consequences of their repression, you will like this sterling collection.	2003-02-01

We learn that Theresa's caretaking is rooted in more than just her empathy and precocity; it is born out of necessity because Theresa finds herself a skycraper of moral sturdiness in a community of adults who, through alchohol, selfishness, and class envy, have abnegated their responsbility to their children, abandoning them as they pursue their self-interests. In contrast, Theresa is compelled to be a caretaker, to impose her moral sharpness where it's lacking. Distant from her parents, she finds solace in playing this earth mother role. She needs to be needed as much as the children and stray dogs need her. Detailed and realistic, the novel shows a heart-broken girl trying to take the slack in a world where adults have forgotten how to love.	2003-01-22

Wallace's depression is our joy because he is extremely funny in the way he shows how the Pampering Industry, that is, the boat cruise staff, is in fact a bunch of bullies who force us to \\"have a good time\\" as we luxuriate on a cruiser, which Wallace envisions as a sort of huge, warm womb where consciousness is lost and where the tourists experience a sort of death. Funny, profound, disturbing, Wallace hits a home run in an essay that was originally published in Harper's magazine around 1995. I believe this version is slightly different, longer, but curiously, missing some juicy parts that I remember enjoying in the magazine version.	2002-11-18

Sadly, the truly pious Servetus loses the relgious battle to Calvin and the former is burned at the stake. The burning is literal but also a metaphor for the truth and goodness in Christianity that, for the middle of the 16th century, lost out to the legalism and festering cruelty of John Calvin and his ilk.	2002-11-16

The novel explores the way repression, in its extremes, fragments people so that they can divide themselves into various personalities. Indeed, the Horned Man proves to be the alter-ego of English professor Lawrence Miller, a man who cannot face up to the evil let alone normal impulses within himself as he tries to hide behind the ivory tower of academia. I look forward to reading future James Lasdun novels.	2002-11-09

Why? Because it seems that too much that is explored here is already known or somewhat obvious to many: That students, divided by cliques, are caught up in pop culture craze and have contempt for education. That teachers have egos and frailties that often impede their careers. That there is no coordination between teachers, parents, and students, so that the school system is in chaos.

Perks never preaches, analyzes, or tells us much. Instead, she narrates strings and strings of memories. The only problem with this approach is that there is not much dramatic tension, no roller coaster ride, but a sort of flat line throughout the 160-page book. However, her style and language are sharp and immaculate.	2002-08-16

Each chapter is like a trenchant poem and indeed it did not surprise me when I found out later that Jennings is an award-winning poet. The novel's title &quot;Snake&quot; seems to be a metaphor for the deranged, poisonous state people become seduced in when their desperate need for social acceptance compels them to capitulate to traditions and customs (in this case a marriage with all its false promises)and after the intoxication of the ceremony and public approval wears off they must face the sobering realization that they have joined union with someone completely incompatible with them.

One way to use this book is to pair up the stories. For example, one can look at &quot;The Misfit's Misguided Quest for Love&quot; by studying &quot;Bartleby&quot; by Melville and &quot;The Overcoat&quot; by Gogol.<br />Another good pairing is to study &quot;Lost Love and Alcohol&quot; by looking at &quot;Babylon Revisted&quot; by Fitzgerald and &quot;The Swimmer&quot; by John Cheever.  In both stories the characters lose free will as their self-destructiveness reaches a point of no return.<br />The power of empathy to remove blindness can be found by looking at Raymond Carver's &quot;A Small, Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Cathedral.&quot; Another great story about the power of empathy is Richard Baldwin's &quot;Sonny's Blues.&quot;<br />Also take a look at &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot; by Singer and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot; to study the love and widsom of fools.<br />The dangers of intellectual pride are dramatized in Flanner O'Conner's &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; and Hawthorne's &quot;Young Goodman Brown.&quot;<br />Yet another fine pairing can be found by studying the conflict between romantic, personal love and public responsibility in Chekhov's &quot;The Lady with the Dog&quot; and John Updike's &quot;Separating.&quot;<br />One of my favorite pairings is to study &quot;The Love of the Tribe over the Love of Humanity&quot; by studying &quot;Those Who Walked Away from Omelas&quot; and &quot;The Lottery.&quot;<br />There are even far more stories than the ones I've mentioned.

He lives the life of a voluptuate, a sensuous predatory playboy whose life gets derailed during a sex scandal. Expelled from the university, Lurie must venture into the wildnerness and find redemption by developing a sense of community and empathy.

What makes Ronson's book remarkable is that he never condescends to his subjects, he never takes cheap shots, and he never tries to show how cute he is (the way Michael Moore does in his film Roger and Me, for example). Ronson is smart enough to know that his crackpot characters speak loudly enough for themselves. With spare, sometimes droll, prose, Ronson provides an entertaining and piquant picture of the extremist mind. Finally, Ronson should be praised for never promoting any kind of political agenda of his own. We can infer that Ronson is too clever and has too much humanity to be an ideologue. Reading this book is like a cross between a Bill Bryson travel book and an Errol Morris documentary. Very compelling reading.	2002-05-20

Tobias' stepfather Dwight is so frustrated and enraged by his own incompetence that he needs a scapegoat. And who should it be? His stepson Toby of course. This memoir pits the bright young Toby against his evil stepfather in a collision that has more drama than most novels. Tobias Wolff is so sharp that he is able to put his memoir in the context of The Great Gatsby and show a young man and his mother searching for identity and the American Dream of Eternal Self-Reinvention. We see Tobias grow up and become someone of great strength and humanity in spite of his malice- and rancor-filled stepfather in what is a highly compelling story of survival, wit, and struggling into young adulthood.	2002-05-20

By showing the disparity between Glahn's perception of himself, which is rather romantic and lofty, with the \\"other\\" Glahn, the uncouth, abrasive one who clashes with other people, Knut Hamsun succeeds in writing an ambiguous, mysterious fable about the conflict between solitude and civilization, and how the \\"self\\" cannot be defined in its isolated state.<br /><br />For an updated theme of the man being taken over by his inner beast, check out James Lasdun's modern masterpiece The Horned Man.	2002-02-28

Divorced twice, the lonely narrator lusts over young women who flock Joe, a feral young man, who, sustaining a brain injury, takes on the role of the town's \\"Noble Savage.\\" The novella's comedy and deep, soulful pain comes from the  sexually-frustrated, overintellectual narrator idealizing Joe into something akin to a hypersexualized Pan. It's clear that the narrator lives vicariously through what he perceives as Joe's unlimited sexual prowess.<br />The novella is well-paced and combines a compelling narrative with a meditation on the conflict between our impulse to live the simple, \\"real\\" life resembling our animal nature and our impulse to indulge in our \\"sophisticated\\" passions, which too often make us forget who we really are.	2002-02-05

To the contrary, this promise was a big lie that was a thin guise for a culture of protracted adolescence, selfishness, hedonism, and ultimately nihilism and despair. Looking back, it's almost easy to criticize the sexual revolution since we can see the zany pop psychology beliefs and appalling displays of selfishness that this so-called \\"Revolution\\" spawned. However easy the target, the sexual revolution is still considered the final word on sexuality for many and these essays for the most part offer an incisive and stimulating antidote to the excesses of the sexual revolution and make important critiques against the way we denigrate monogamy, the way children are inappropriately sexualized and exploited by pop culture, and the way certain \\"intellectuals\\" reduce human beings to science, removing the soul and its needs from any kind of discussion about family and sexuality. Bear in mind, these essays are written by writers who are members of a conservative think tank, so you're not exactly getting diverse opinions here. Nevertheless, considering how saturated our popular culture is with frenzied sex, these essays are an important call to pause and examine sexuality and its discontents in our society.	2002-01-21

Absent in Carver's stories are stereotypical characters. For example, in &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,&quot; we read a story about a heart surgeon, Mel McGuiness, who is obsessed with preaching the virutes of absolute love to his wife and two friends, another couple. As we read the story, we see evidence that Mel is the embodiment of the absence of love. He is imperious, bullying, dogmatic, control-obsessed, fearful of life. Yet Carver doesn't allow us to dismiss Mel so easily. As Mel pontificates on love and gets more and more drunk, we are afforded glimpses of Mel's profound wisdom, which shows that there are two Mels, a tyrant and a vulnerable searcher of truth, that are warring against each other. Mel, the searcher of truth, knows there is a more profound, permanent love than merely carnal or erotic passion. At one point in the story, he confesses, in a moment of drunkenness, that he is completely ignorant of life. We sympathize with Mel's passion for &quot;ultimate love,&quot; yet we are at the same time appalled at Mel's bullying and vanity.<br />Mel's character is indicative of the kind of complexities and contradictions that Carver dramatizes in his very readable stories.	2002-01-17

Starting with her son's disastrous jaunt into an expensive college, Lee does some soul-searching and concludes that in too many cases college is wasted on people who are not poised to benifit from it. She cites many reasons for not going to college. Among them a lack of maturity, the low rate of college graduation, the culture of hedonism, slackers, and ant-intellectualism, the binge drinking at college campuses, the many students who go for lack of any other alternatives, the outrageous college costs, the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of too many colleges. Lee suggests that young high school graduates might be better served if they take time off and do &quot;character-building&quot; activities such as volunteer work on an Indian reservation, an orphanage, or some such place. Only after someone has matured and is hungry for college learning, Lee argues, should that person go to college. Finally, she points out that many successful people never went to college and that many high-paying jobs only require, at the most, a certificate or a two-year community college degree.<br />There is much to admire in Lee's critique of Americans' blind march to college. However, some of her arguments seem less than convincing. First, her idea that high school graduates should take time off may result in protracted drifting. These young people, more than ever, may need structure and guidance found in some college environments. Second, the &quot;character-building&quot; activities Lee discusses require a certain emotional maturity, the very thing these young people lack, which is why they're not ready for college in the first place. I'm not sure very many people have the tools to work at an orphanage or a reservation right out of high school. Third, only a small percentage of people have the brilliance to be computer wizards and entrepeneurs. Therefore, I'm not sure these glorious careers can be obtained by a significant portion of the population. Fourth, when Lee wrote this book the economy was booming. She cited Cisco hiring people with two-year certificates at 60 and 70K a year. Since the book's publishing, the stock market has become sluggish and Cisco is probably not hiring as robustly as it did when Lee was writing. Finally, I'm not sure Lee's experience with her son, who by all accounts was a spoiled rich baby, makes sufficient basis for generalizing about the virtues of going to college. Whatever refutations Lee makes about going to college, the fact remains that in this country there is a huge stigma attached to those who don't have a college degree and all too few of us can, like John Cheever or Bill Gates, transcend that stigma.refore, I'm not sure these glorious careers can be obtained by a significant portion of the population.

Additionally, Charles marries a young, beautiful woman, Emma, who intoxicated on romance novels, expects her marriage to Charles to be as grand and splendid as the romances she has gorged on all her life. As one would expect, her marriage is hellish, isolating, and frustrating; Emma grows more and more irritable with her husband and looks to allay her frustrations by spending beyond her means and by engaging in affairs with fops, charlatans, and other mountebanks who seduce Emma with the illusions of romance she has read in her novels. Her growing debts and growing disillusionment with her lovers reaches a climax that I'll save for the reader.<br />The novel's plot is actually a vehicle for Flaubert's real agenda: to skewer the vulgarities and pettiness of the middle-class. He shows no mercy and is rather misanthropic in his portrayal of his characters. Nevertheless, his vision is a true and vigorous one. This is not a novel for people who want to sit back and enjoy a French period piece romance.

To counterpoint this dream of infinite freedom and excess is the the Puritan impulse of repression, so that the characters are tormented by a contradiction: the need to live out their Dionysian fantasies and the need to scour those excesses with their Puritan background. My favorite stories, &quot;Torch Song,&quot; &quot;The Swimmer,&quot; &quot;Pot of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Country Husband,&quot; Goodbye, My Brother,&quot; and &quot;The Enormous Radio,&quot; dramatize this conflict between people carried away with a twisted version of the American Dream and how this dream, a delusion, eats away at them until they're hanging on a thread.

The narrator, Jack Gladney, is a professor of Hitler Studies, a program he created in order to be a sort of celebrity figure and even an American icon. Of course his ambition is an absurd one. To erect Hitler studies as a &quot;product&quot; like Panasonic and Lexus is to be morally disconnected from the meaning of Hitler. But of course Jack is drunk, like most Americans, on commercialism. He believes, erroneously, that commercialism at its best converts mundane things into icons, giving them the power to transcend the one thing that nags Jack above all else--death. His misguided attempt at transcendence results in an amazing final scene that I cannot divulge for fear that the current reader has not yet read the novel.<br />Final note: The book contains priceless aporphisms that are for me the real treasure of the novel.	2001-12-29

Clearly, the cat bite is an &quot;existential&quot; bite, that opens up her true wounds and allows her to see her life for what it is: She is living the yuppie dream, a misguided quest for perfection through class ascent and image. Her husband Otto is realistically drawn, an anal money-grabber who distrusts humanity. Everyone is a potential competitor, including his wife, so that even love making for him is a sick enterprise of &quot;triumph.&quot;<br />This book is your consumate modernist novel, which is to say, it is about a character, Sophie, searching for vitality and, not finding it, sinking into inertia and nihilism.<br />This is an excellent condemnation of the modernistic dream of money without anything else.	2001-12-15

This new effort, fifty pages shorter than the others, is less earthy, more abstract. Mills is audacious enough to retell the story of Adam and Eve, Man's quest of knowledge, his need for faith and conformity in a story about people who want to live in tin houses who feel threatened by a man who would &quot;branch out&quot; to houses made of clay. The narrator, a definite &quot;tin man,&quot; represents the impulse to retreat into the cozy womb of nonrisk and stagnant consciousness while a strange messiah figure, Michael Hawkins, represents the impulse to venture into unchartered territory. The novel has the same droll sensibility of the other novels and is packed with philosophical ideas, yet I must confess I love the first two novels more, as Mills has plenty of thematic richness when he keeps both feet planted in the soil.	2001-12-10

Shark: The Novel	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Entertaining, Intelligent Skewering of Informercials and TV	If you like The Simpsons and The Onion and were waiting for a brilliant young novelist with that sensibility to incorporate that kind of satirical aim with silky prose, loaded with original aphorisms and biting observations about infomercials and an entire culture drugged by TV hype, I suspect you will like this novel. Close to a hundred chapters with each chapter around two pages, this novel is comprised of potent epigrams that made me sometimes think I was listening to one of my favorite comediens Steve Wright or at other times watching my favorite cartoon The Simpsons, or at other times reading something from The Onion. As far as plot goes, a family goes to Vegas to watch a pay per view special event, what is a hyped up battle between a bear and a shark, hence the title. Of course, this premise is simply the excuse to write his satire. If you read &quot;page turners&quot; in the sense of &quot;what happens next?&quot;, then this is not your kind of novel. But if you love the humor of Steve Wright, The Simpsons, and The Onion and appreciate incredible writing style and polish, I'm almost sure you'll love this novel, as I do.	2001-11-12

The aging melancholy, dyspeptic professor is both immersed in New York and alienated from it as he analyzes all that is around him during the summer of 2000 when among other things there is national hysteria over the Elian Gonzalez case. For me the treat of this novel is not the story line but Rushdie's diatribes against human idiocy. For example he succinctly derides the sentimental brutishness of the Elian worshippers in a way that made me laugh and say to myself, &quot;Why didn't I write that?&quot; I kept doing this as I read the novel, envying Rushdie for his ability to articulate human foolishness in all its magnitude. This book is a profoundly beautiful satire where Rushdie combines the topical with the mythical and makes it look easy. I've tried to read three Rushdie books before and couldn't finish them. This book is an exception.	2001-10-27

The result is a collection of stories that is both comic and sad. These characters seem rather nihilistic in their lack of free-will and the abyss of despair and acedia that they've succumbed to. Lorrie Moore is at the top of the literary food chain when it comes to writing these kind of short stories. There are imitators who try to be cool with their nihilistic, cynical stories, but Lorrie Moore is the genuine article.	2001-09-03

The title suggests that this will be a rigorous refutation of the weak-minded victimization that afflicts our society. Addiction is, after all, a choice and we are morally accountable. While I agree with Schaler that we are accountable for our bad choices, these bad choices are, contrary to Schaler, indeed the result of a \\"diseased\\" individual whose will has to be subordinated to a new set of values, a change that many people cannot perform on their own volition. Schaler's \\"Free-Will Model\\" is partly true and helpful, but ultimately an oversimplification that denies that diseases can be more than literal, scientific afflictions like syphilis. Diseases can, contrary to Schaler's thesis, be of a spiritual origin. For example, a husband who watches internet porn for several hours every night and ignores his family has both made a bad choice and at the same time is demonstrating a diseased spirit. Why can't Schaler see this? And why must Schaler use unimpressive demogoguery to refute his opponents, as he does on page 9, where he writes that if you find his \\"Free-Will\\" Model of addiction \\"ludicrous or outragous, you are addicted to the disease model.\\" I find the disease model, in its extreme, as morally repugnant and illogical as Schaler does. However, I find his extreme free-will model to be an equal oversimplification. The truth is somewhere in the middle. But forcing his thesis and his Procrustean cure for addictive behavior, he creates an either/or dichotomy, which is not sophisticated or convincing argumentation.	2001-06-06

A sixty-two-year-old lit professor, cultural critic, and minor celebritiy, Kopesh uses his privilege to seduce the youngest, most beautiful women in the world, students, groupies, sycophants. What elevates this story...is the context of competing social forces in the American psyche, the forces of hypersexuality vs. the forces of anti-sexuality. It appears that Kopesh's despair is that the more he seeks religious experience and fulfillment through sexual ecstasy the more empty, vulnerable, and discombobulated he becomes. He does not preach for or against the sexual revolution; rather, he shows the wreckage of his life as a sort of casualty of the sexual revolution, which promised freedom, happiness, and fulfillment through unlimited access to orgasms. A highly readable novel. What makes Roth such a major writer is that too many writers of his caliber waste everyone's time by blowing smoke up our butts while Roth speaks the truth in his own eloquent style.	2001-05-14

A life devoted to provisionalism, prudence, hoarding, reason, the same kind of life embraced by the narrator in Melville's &quot;Bartleby,&quot; proves to result in a spiritually bankrupt soul. George earnestly seeks in vain for meaning and in doing so the novel sheds light on the bleakness of provisionalism as the modernist philosophy which the American middle class championed so blindly in the 1960s, the era in which this novel is written. George may fail in his search for meaning, but the novel is a triumph of vigorous prose, muscular syntax, and an uncompromising, angry critique of the smug middle-class complacency that afflicts too many of us.	2001-03-09

Mills' novel is so funny and so deceptively facile. My friends who have also read and love the novel can't  get over how easy Mills makes it look. But no one else is doing what he is  doing. His latest novel All Is Quiet On the Orient Express is just as good.	1999-12-18

He did it in Restraint of Beasts and does it again in his latest effort. He brilliantly has pulled off a fable about barter and  wages in a contemporary yet primitive society ruled by a mysterious  partiarch. The nameless narrator sinks deeper and deeper into the  patriarch's clutches while deluding himself that he is about to make a  voyage. But the narrator's trip east is simply a chimera. He has more in  common with the stagnant town than he wants to believe. Ultimately, it's  not the plot but the style, the language, the dialogue, and the humor that  is so magical and compelling. I hope Mills publishes his absurd fables once  a year.	1999-10-02

A great stylist, Queenan ranks up there with Paul Fussell's BAD, The Dumbing of America and Class. His Red Lobster critique is written with vigor and  talent. It's so easy to surrender into malaise as we contemplate  the championed vulgarities of our culture, but Queenan effectively and  rightfully and humorously denigrates Americans' affection for the crass and  the ignorant. A must read for any critical thinker.	1999-06-12

Luther is painted as a compulsive sometimes hysterical man trapped in the adolescent stage, hungry for \\"grace\\" as a solution to his arrested emotional development. He further develops the notion  that man must find God by himself and his Bible has had a huge effect on  the Western World. This book articulates some of the most trenchant  insights on psychology, history, and religion.	1999-05-09

There are two stories, &quot;Tarantula,&quot; and &quot;Mouses,&quot; which alone are  worth the price of the book. The former is a scathing satire about a man  full of ugly ambition and ego who sees himself using a poor inner city  school as a stepping stone for his career in education. He alienates  himself from everyone and is, to the reader's delight, flung from his tower  of self-importance. The second story is about a grotesque man with a knot  in his spine who becomes obsessed with keeping mice in his home, where he  conducts cruel experiements. While the tale is morbid, the narrator's voice  is comical enough to compensate for the sheer darkness of the subject  matter. Jones succeeds in writing a fable about power. And here lies one of  the strengths of Jones' art: By being able to assume the persona of the  most extreme personalities, he is uses humor while exploring man's hubris,  his cruelty, and his ambition. He ranks with Tobias Wolff as one of my  favorite short story writers.	1999-01-16
