I have read all 15 novels Tyler has written prior to \\"The Amateur Marriage\\"; I even read the picture book she wrote for children. For the past year or so, I have been checking this site every couple of weeks, waiting and waiting to see if a new Anne Tyler novel is in the works. (Even though there are lots and lots of other authors I love, present and past, to keep me very busy, especially in that I usually read four or five books at the same time. Nonetheless, I still very much look forward to that new Tyler novel.)<br />\\"Marriage\\" was reviewed in both the daily edition of \\"The NY Times\\" and in the Sunday \\"NY Times Book Review.\\" It was the cover story of that Sunday book section, and both reviewers were falling over themselves praising this book, especially the Sunday reviewer. As I wrote, I had been eagerly awaiting a new Anne Tyler book for quite a while. After I read those reviews, I was almost having apoplexy until I could get that book into my hands.<br />Well, it was in my hands over the weekend, and it was read. What a HUGE disappointment. It does not feel like an Anne Tyler book -- the writing is pedestrian. It is a WONDERFUL plot with a very important theme -- the pain of a mismatched couple not only for themselves, but also for their children who are subjected to their unfortunate union. But it is just not written well enough to really illuminate this theme. <br />If this is the first Anne Tyler book you've read and you don't think it's anything special, please, know you are right, but don't give up on this author. Please try Tyler's \\"Saint Maybe,\\" \\"The Accidental Tourist,\\" \\"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,\\" \\"Ladder of Years,\\" and the Pulitzer prize- winning \\"Breathing Lessons.\\" In fact, all of Tyler's novels prior to \\"Marriage\\" are either excellent, or very, very good (except \\"The Tin Can Tree\\", which was pretty boring), but the ones I have listed are the best of the best, IMO.<br />Remember, this review waswritten by a rabid Anne Tyler fan, and it did, indeed, pain me to write it.	2004-02-04

Finally, one snowy weekend last month, I took it off the shelf and started reading. I loved it from the get-go -- it's simply one of the best memoirs ever written, IMO. (I've read a lot of autobios/memoirs, especially in my younger years, so I write with some knowledge in this area.)<br />I'll always remember that snowy weekend I spent \\"with Neil,\\" and I'll also always remember how I ran to get the sequel, \\"The Play Goes On,\\" on Monday.

I have absolutely no interest in fashion, but I do have a great interest in well-written contemporary literature, especially first novels, which is why I love \\"Elegance.\\"<br /><br />I was drawn to this book by its fire-engine red cover, and the great drawing and design. So many times, the cover is WAY better than what's inside (and vice versa, also, of course), but this is not the case here.<br /><br />I'm exactly half-way through this book, and just had to stop reading and give it a well-deserved plug on this site. I skimmed the other customer reviews here, and IMO this book is nothing like \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" -- I read one chapter of \\"Bridget\\" and then called it quits. Other reviewers also commented that this is \\"Brit Lit\\" -- the author is American, the protagonist is an American albeit one who is living in London, and this book has a distinctly American voice to it, despite the author's appropriate use of some British words. (\\"When in Rome,\\" etc....)<br /><br />Simply put, the book is beautiful inside and out. I hope you're working on a second one, Ms. Tessaro!	2003-12-26

This is the first book I read by Hijuelos, and as soon as I finished it, I went and got Hijuelos's first novel, \\"Our House in the Last World,\\" and loved it every bit as much as \\"Mambo Kings.\\" I've read Hijuelos's three novels that followed \\"Mambo Kings,\\" and while they were all OK (this is a talented writer) they were not as good as his first two.<br />Oh, I almost forgot. About a year after I read \\"Mambo Kings,\\" I lent it to a woman -- a very bright woman -- but, unlike me, she's just not much of a reader. She also loved this book.<br />I'm a female. The two aforementioned people are females. Unlike many of the previous reviewers, not one of us was one iota offended by the book's sexuality. Everything in the book rang true, and that's what counts.<br />My tastes change. I'm not so sure I would love this book now as much as I did about a dozen years ago.

It appears Karon's been given free rein to pubish just about anything, based on the best-selling popularity of her &quot;Mitford&quot; series.  There are TONS of better things available for children.	2001-11-04
US	41492292	R3GOBLMMLSCE0H	0446364495	879659950	The Bridges of Madison County	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not a Great Book, but I Like Waller's Sense, and Sensibility	This is a story about a woman named Francesca and a man named Robert. In one scene, Francesca is preparing a meatless stew and Robert is talking to her. Here's a snippet of their conversation: <br />&quot;'It already smells good,' he said, pointing toward the stove. 'It smells . . . quiet.' He looked at her.<br />&quot;'Quiet? Could something smell quiet?' She was thinking about the phrase, asking herself. He was right. After the pork chops and steaks and roasts she cooked for the family, this was quiet cooking. No violence involved anywhere down the food chain, except maybe for pulling up the vegetables. The stew cooked quietly and smelled quiet. It was quiet here in the kitchen.&quot; <br />I honor and admire the sensitivity of the man who wrote those words, which is why I have read most of Waller's work. His &quot;Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend&quot; was particularly enjoyable (maybe even better than &quot;Bridges&quot;) but I LOATHED &quot;Border Music.&quot; But even though Waller is certainly not a great writer, I'll always keep an eye out for his work, because, as I said in my title, I like his SENSE, and I like his SENSIBILITY.	2001-10-30

Might particularly resonate with adoptees, but should be enjoyed by all gentle readers. To give you a good feel for the book, I'm going to quote one-half of my very favorite passage. If it doesn't make you want to read this book IMMEDIATELY, then this book isn't for you. Here goes: <br />&quot;He held me and let me cry into his neck for what felt like hours. He produced a bubble bath somehow when I didn't even own the stuff. He found a tray and a bud vase and the makings of cinnamon toast. I told him I loved him, and not because I was vulnerable and hysterical and orphaned or because he was acting like a paid companion from the Visiting Nurses Association, but because he left school for me and never mentioned the leaving or getting back. 'You'd do it for me,' he said.&quot;<br />I liked Lipman's second book, &quot;The Way Men Act,&quot; but not as much as this one. Her short story collection, &quot;Into Love and Out Again&quot; was pleasant, but her third novel, &quot;Isabel's Bed,&quot; was a tedious bore. Because of how disappointed I was by &quot;Isabel,&quot; I gave up on Lipman, and have not read her most recent couple of novels.<br />But I'll ALWAYS remember how glad I was that I found &quot;Then She Found Me.&quot;	2001-10-30

Well, I'm going to quote just ONE SENTENCE from this book; if it appeals, this book, and Updike in general, is for you; if it doesn't, steer clear of this novel, and Updike in general. Here goes: <br />&quot;As her mind clears of its dreams -- plausible dramas sinking rapidly into oblivion, leaving behind shreds that melt as her mind tries to grasp them: her father and mother present in the Jenkinses' front parlor on South Duke Street, her father holding a teacup poised beneath his double chin, the saucer several buttons below, her mother on the sofa in her lace cap, Ann feeling her breast bursting with pent-up rage, the handle of a riding crop long and leathery in her hand, all discussing some issue (there were others present, Slaymakers and Jacobses) involving Mr. Buchanan, how a prankish bid of his at an auction had caused all the banks in Lancaster to fail, and a terrible vastation of financial panic to fall upon the entire town, while she was crying that it had not been his fault, he had simply misjudged, in the eagerness of his desire to be accepted by his peers and fellow Masons; and then they were outdoors, or rather she was outdoors alone, in a little close place of frozen ferns and ivy and mossy bricks, all rising around her like the walls of a well, to a spot of sky no bigger than the moon, a man's cut-out shadow at the top, gazing silently down, and she tried to scream for help and the silence that emerged from her locked throat must have been what woke her so suddenly -- as her mind clears, she sees the horror in her hopeless social humiliated situation.&quot;<br />Folks, this is ONE SENTENCE, and it took up more than half the page of my edition of the book. (I measured it; the page is six and a half inches long, the sentence is three and a half inches long.) I congratulate Mr. Updike on his ability to remain grammatical while avoiding the punctuation mark known as a period for over half a page of text. But I don't much care for this unnecessarily convoluted writing style.<br />I really liked Updike's first two &quot;Bech&quot; books (I haven't yet gotten to the third one), and was very fond of &quot;Roger's Version.&quot; I really disliked the much-celebrated &quot;Rabbit&quot; books, and couldn't stand &quot;The Witches of Eastwick.&quot; (The movie was lousy also.) I plan on reading his latest &quot;Bech&quot; book, and then, as I said in my title, I'm giving up on Updike.	2001-10-28
US	41492292	R177VEC4UTTIGO	0684804433	296077082	Look Homeward, Angel	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Look to this book	A very well-read, highly educated person, with whom I had a passing acquaintance, mentioned one day that &quot;Of Time and the River,&quot; by Thomas Wolfe, was her all-time favorite book. Very shortly after that, I read somewhere that &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; was the actor Anthony Quinn's favorite book. Okay, now this title, previously unbeknownst to me, was somewhat &quot;following me around,&quot; and my reader's curiosity was piqued, and I went to investigate. I discovered that &quot;Time and River&quot; was a sequel to &quot;Look Homeward, Angel,&quot; which is how I wound up reading this book. Did I feel about this book the way my acquaintance (and Mr. Quinn) felt about its sequel? Not by a long shot, but still this book is a MUST-READ. Why? Even though parts of it are dull, Wolfe has a brilliant capacity for poetically explaining certain types of situations and behaviors that I have oft found incomprehensible. If I'm compelled to underline sentences and paragraphs, as I was with this book, then I'm also compelled to recommend this book and rate it even half a star higher than it deserves. (It doesn't really deserve a full four stars, because it took me FOREVER to finish, which is never a good sign.) <br />Well, now I'm off, to begin the much-anticipated sequel, &quot;Of Time and the River.&quot;	2001-10-28

It took me longer to read this boring novella than it did to complete &quot;Gone With the Wind!&quot;  I know, I know, Bellow is a Nobel prize winner, but just because his work has merit doesn't make me like this tedious book any better.  This book is for you if the thought of endless talk about the price of soybeans and lard on the stock market, spoken by essentially dull characters, makes your heart beat faster and your pulse start racing.  Thankfully, this book was not my introduction to Bellow;  I started with his first two novels, &quot;Dangling Man,&quot; and &quot;The Victim,&quot; and I liked them.  Then I read &quot;Herzog&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sammler's Planet&quot; and I LOVED them.  I will never give up on this author -- he's a masterful writer, and his &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; and &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; are waiting for me on my bookshelf. (Books are so patient.) But &quot;Seize&quot; was definitely a disappointing dud.	2001-10-27

I came to this book because Tyler is one of my favorite contemporary novelists, and even though I love tons of other novelists both present and past, sometimes I just can't wait for Tyler's latest to hit the stores. So, I read her children's book, and I was enchanted.  The story is great, the pictures are charming, but what I liked best was the book's &quot;Child is father of man&quot; philosophy.  Modarressi, who happens to be Tyler's daughter, has written and illustrated a number of other books: don't miss &quot;Yard Sale!&quot; and &quot;The Parent Thief&quot; and even the weaker &quot;The Dream Pillow&quot; is worth a look-see.	2001-10-22

This is a very absorbing, comforting read, and I'd have to say it was one of my favorite books of the 1990s (and I read approximately 500 books a decade), since it was somehow instrumental in soothing me after the death of my beloved cat.  Don't miss this one.	2001-10-21

But to say this book is a downer is putting it mildly. Hassler's &quot;Simon's Night&quot; and &quot;A Green Journey&quot; tie for my favorite Hassler novels, with his first novel, &quot;Staggerford,&quot; coming in at a close second. I just wish he'd lighten up a bit, and give a little more warmth and coziness -- in the hands of a skilled writer such as Hassler, those qualities don't always mean &quot;saccharine&quot; and &quot;lightweight.&quot;<br />But I can't stress enough that Hassler is, indeed, a VERY skilled storyteller, and certainly worth your time.	2001-10-19

I want to read more and more and more, now and always and forever.\\" This is truly the first book I LOVED, and absolutely the book that started me on my bookish path in life, from where I have never strayed. Parents, teachers, or anyone who wants to give a wonderful book to a child between the ages of eight and ten, order this book now.	2001-10-18

I read James' &quot;Turn of the Screw,&quot; and &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.)  One of my all time favorite books was James' &quot;Washington Square.&quot; It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote &quot;Square&quot; and &quot;Maisie.&quot;  This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts.	2001-10-17

I just finished reading &quot;Grownups&quot; ... what can I say, it's a page turner, it's an easy, light read, but it's certainly not one of Tyler's best. I've read every novel Tyler has written (I've even read Tyler's daughter's children's books -- they're great, and I even checked out her husband's novels, but those didn't interest me), my favorites being (more or less in order): &quot;Saint Maybe,&quot; &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,&quot; &quot;Ladder of Years,&quot; &quot;The Accidental Tourist,&quot; and the Pulitzer prize winning &quot;Breathing Lessons.&quot; But if you're a step-parent, &quot;Grownups&quot; might resonate with you -- its protagonist could serve as a role model for step-parents everywhere.	2001-10-14

But I went back to it, and was very glad I did. On page 147, the character of George was introduced, and gave the book some much needed life. If I could have communicated with the author I would have advised him to tell the story from this character's perspective; I like to imagine that this character might be Pei's alter ego, but of course have no way of knowing that. I'm glad I stuck with the book because I got to &quot;meet&quot; George; I liked the sweet, sensitive, smart George so much I even went running to check out his favorite book, Robert Penn Warren's &quot;All the King's Men.&quot; If you just read the book from the page where George is introduced all the way to the end, you wouldn't be missing much, unless you like endless descriptions of household chores, errands, and especially, home repair.<br />Without George, I would have rated this book two stars. I'd like Pei to write another novel, and bring back George, this time as the protagonist.	2001-10-10

(Why? Because Irving is a master at pulling at the heartstrings, but in the most INTELLIGENT of fasions.) Of Irving's pre-1990 work, this is his best novel, with &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; running a distant second, and &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and the lesser-known &quot;Water Method Man&quot; tying for third place. Irving was one of my favorite novelists of the 1980's, and this book was one of the oh, say, top five books I read during that decade (and I read about 500 books a decade). Since my tastes seem to change over time, I have not read any of Irvings's work in about a dozen years. Nonetheless, I implore you not to miss this book, for you'd be missing a unique literary epiphany.	2001-10-10
