US	52830880	RL4RGK4QHPP3A	0345347951	589013680	Childhood's End	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Enjoyable Read	I've only read a couple of books by Clarke, but someone recommended it to me so I figured why not.  The story is about these aliens that come down to earth in the late 20th century for some unknown reason.  Within 50 years, humanity has advanced to the point where nobody has to work anymore and science has advanced so fast.  But there is a catch, which I won't spoil here. <br /> <br />I liked the pace of the book, and I think Clarke is pretty descriptive of things that could be.  He skips from the 1970's to the 2050's.  He also does well describing the homeland of the aliens.  A couple of things bothered me, however.  One was the explanation of how we had seen the aliens before.  I thought it was a bit convoluted and could've been much simpler and more to the point.  Another is the \\"catch,\\" which wasn't really fleshed out that much.  I was a bit disappointed by the end, but it does make sense that it would end that way.   <br /> <br />Overall I would recommend sci-fi fans to read this if they haven't already.  You can grab it from the library or used-its pretty short for the price of paperbacks.  If you don't like sci-fi, it doesn't have a lot of detail of science theories (except for a brief discussion of relativity).  It is a well written book, and I did enjoy it despite the flaws.	2004-08-29

After reading it I must say that I will be reading more from this author.<br />The story is told from the first person viewpoint of Fitz, the (...) son of Prince Chivalry, next in line for the throne of the 6 Duchies.  Basically this first book is a big setup for the rest of the series.  We see Fitz trying to adjust to court life, his training as a noble, and his training as an assassin.  We're introduced to many characters around the castle, as well as the harrowing attacks on the coast by Red Ship raiders.<br />I've read others comparing this book to Martin's, and even Tolkien (huh?).  I would say that its difficult to compare to Martin mainly because this is written in first person while GRRM writes in third person.  Both do focus more on the politics of their respective realms, and both have very little, if any, of what would be described as \\"magic.\\"  I would give Martin the edge only because I tend to like epic fantasy more.<br />Overall, I would recommend this to any fantasy reader.  Its well written, and it tweaks the traditional fantasy conventions enough that you'll come back for more.  I know I will read at least the rest of the series.	2004-04-16

I first read this book 20 years ago-before I read any Tolkien (I know, I know).  I really enjoy the banter between the characters, as well as the descriptions of the lay of the land and the different cultures.  The story is about a young boy Garion growing up at a farm.  One day, he and his aunt, with the help of an old storyteller, must leave on a dangerous mission.  I don't want to give too much away because part of the fun is that you discover things the same time as Garion does in the book.  <br />I will say that the tone of the book is unlike most fantasy novels.  These characters are pretty sarcastic and confident of themselves, unlike most of the other series that I have read (Tad Williams, George R R Martin, Robert Jordan, Tolkien, Donaldson, etc.).  It makes the book (and the series) a bit lighthearted and humorous at times.  If you haven't read it yet, I would highly recommend not only the book, but also the entire series.	2004-01-06
US	52830880	R1LP1515F6WYXL	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Enjoyable read	This is my first foray into the cyberpunk genre, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It takes place in the no-so-distant future, where everything in California has become privatized.  Hiro, a self-proclaimed freelance hacker, is delivering pizzas for the mafia when he finds out about a computer virus, Snow Crash, that not only crashes the computer, but hackers' brains as well.  The rest of the story is Hiro, his ex-girlfriend, and sidekick Y.T. trying to figure out what is going on and how they can stop it.<br />The book hits the ground running and never lets up.  Stephenson has an interesting take on religion and has done some solid research on Sumer and its gods and goddesses.  I enjoyed the Metaverse and see definite parallels with today's 'Net, although the virtual reality part of the Metaverse has never caught on in real life.  The ending was a bit of a disappointment for me-it seemed like he just realized he had 5 pages to finish the book and kind of threw it all together.  Overall, though, I thought it was a great read and recommend it to all.	2003-10-31

I picked up this book on a whim awhile back.  After reading the reviews on here, I can understand why the author warned the reader that his view is controversial.<br />Basically Ruhlen gives you a list of about 10-15 words from 10 or so different languages.  Basic words like &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;head&quot; or &quot;water,&quot; words that would've been around for awhile.  He lets the reader group the words accordingly while he would give a few pointers on how words change over time and what one sound would tend to change to.  He starts with the Indo-European languages and proceeds to do the same with Native American, African, and Asian languages as well.  Eventually we find out that all the languages have come from a single mother tongue.  We also find out that his theory coinsides considerably with current genetic theories on the spread of humans.  It was very interesting and fun to do, and Ruhlen never talks down to the reader.<br />That said, there were some problems.  He kept referring to &quot;Indo-Europeanists&quot; who, according to him, dismiss his theories in-hand without even looking at them.  I find this hard to believe.  Sometimes it seemed to me that he all but called them racists.  Then again, after reading some of the quotes from those who disagree with his theory, it all seems a bit petty, like someone who disagreed with a person's theory personally attacked that person.  <br />All in all, it is a good book to read to get a different take on the story of language.  If you're really interested after this, you probably need to get a book that has the &quot;traditional&quot; viewpoint of linguists.	2003-08-21

While I must say that I don't agree with all of them, I will say that this is a great book that I would recommend to anyone.<br />The story is told from the viewpoint of Xeo, who was captured by the Persians after the Battle of Thermopylae, as he told the story to the royal historian, generals, and Xerxes himself.  The first part of the book sets up the conflict:  How Xeo and the other 300 Spartans made it to Thermopylae.  Pressfield goes into detail about Spartan life and customs and doesn't apologize for the brutality of it.  I can't speak to the historical accuracy of it, but from what I remember from my Ancient Greece college classes many years ago it seems pretty accurate.<br />The last half of the book goes into detail about the setup and battle at the Gates of Fire.  The quote [...]in its review is typical of his writing style-no nonsense, almost Spartan in his description of the battle scenes.  His descriptions made me feel like I was there.  After the battle, the last few pages are almost anti-clamatic:  You know (or should know, if you stayed awake for you history classes) the Battle gave the other Greeks time to get their act together and defeat the Persians once and for all.<br />I urge anyone reading this review to pick up a copy of the book as soon as you can.  I highly recommend it.	2003-08-04

I read his book with the hope of finding out how he went from preacher to atheist.  <br />In the first few chapters of the book he tells of this &quot;conversion&quot; and how people around him reacted.  The rest of the book is various articles he has written that basically defends freethinking and atheism.  The two that really hit home for me were the &quot;Dear Believer&quot; and &quot;Dear Theologian&quot; chapters.  He sums up the logical fallacy of believing in a deity so well.   Sometimes he comes off as an atheistic preacher, like when he makes comments to retailers about &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on the money he was giving to her, or advocating &quot;Bible free&quot; rooms at hotels.  This seemed petty to me, but it just shows his dedication to the cause.  <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  Its a good introduction to the basics of freethought and atheism without being too philosophical.  Of course if you're a deeply believing Christian I think you should read it too.  And then try to reconcile you faith with what he says.  It won't be easy.	2003-02-18

I'm glad I did.  Dawkins wrote this book to show that natural selection is the &quot;blind watchmaker.&quot;  Using the exmples of the eye and bat sonar, Dawkins has some pretty persuasive arguements and explanations to show that complex life developed without an ultimate design or designer.  Along the way he explains the subtlies of the theory of evolution via natural selection very well.  At the end of the book he shows that other scientific theories simply don't make sense.  He also points out that, even though other scientists have different theories, they ALL base their theories on the evolutionary process that Darwin formulated.  The only problem I had with Dawkins was his tendency to veer off on some tangents.  Granted, he needed them to explain some point or another, but when he finally got back on point I needed to re-read the section to figure out what the point was.  A minor quibble at best.  <br />So if you're interested in learning more about evolution and natural selection I recommend this book to you.  Come with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.	2003-02-12

An actuary by trade, I enjoy reading books about evolution and prehistory.  When I saw this book, I figured it would be good for a type of background reading to help me more fully understand what went on during the Holocene and how it affected humans.<br />While it did not really make that connection, I did find it pretty interesting.  He explains the different techniques of dating and why you would use them.  It is facinating that the experts can determine so much information about the local environment over, say, a meter long core sample from the bottom of a lake.  It didn't get too technical until the last chapter where he was discussing the impact of pollution on the environment.<br />The last chapter sums up nicely the major developments of the last 11,000 years and also discusses why viewing nature as a static entity is not the proper way for conservationalists to look at it.  All and all a good read for those interested in weather and the transformation of the earth.	2003-01-17

I expected another book that was well written, where the author could explain the material to a novice on this subject like myself.  I was not disappointed.<br />How did humans become human, and how did we evolve so differently so quickly from our primate relatives?  Those are the questions he tries to answer in this book.  Readers of GG&S will be familiar with a couple of the chapters in this book that touch on the same subject matter.  However, don't let that stop you from looking at this book.  Diamond looks at many aspects of humanity-both good (art, language) and bad (drug abuse, murder/genocide, destruction of environment) and tries to figure out how they developed or where they came from.  I particularly enjoyed his treatment of language developement as well as his discussion of murder and genocide.  We are not as different from animals as I thought regarding those topics.  Plus, he explains everything very well.  I had no problems following his logic or explanations.  I would recommend this book for all to read.	2002-12-09

I am not disappointed.  This has more graphs and pictures than Stewart to help explain some of the fundamentals better.  While the content and the layout are pretty much the same as other Calculus books, I particularly liked the writing style of the authors, who eplained things well without being really technical.  If you are looking for a Calculus text that helps you solve the problems then I think this one is for you.  There is a fair amount of rigor (i.e. proofs and theory) here, but no more than other texts.  If you are looking for more of the theory behind the applications, I would try Apostol's 2 volume set which is much more rigorous.  If you are looking for a text to study Exam 1, then this is the one for you.	2002-10-24

Leakey writes very well and explains things quite concisely.  He gives an overview of the major theories, but due to the shortness of the book (only 171 pages including index) he only fleshes out his own theories.  I am not an expert in anthropology so I don't know if he is grasping at straws or not.  He gives a pretty good bibliography in the back for further reading.  There are some problems with the book.  First, it is very short, so the author does not have time to really delve into the different theories as much as you may wish he would.  Second, this book was written almost ten years ago.  There has been more discoveries since then, including the 6 million year old hominid fossils in Chad, which I wish he addressed in an epilogue or an updated version of the book.  I would recommend this if you have no background in anthropology and then do some extra research on the web to get up to date with new findings.	2002-07-12

There is too much memorizing, and not enough math for my tastes.  When I picked up this book, I figured I'd give it a try anyway.  I had read Richard Fortey's book _Life_ (a good intro to the history of life) and wanted a little more depth.  Boy did I get it.<br />This is a well written book.  The first section is about the history of the quest to find these early fossils and the different theories.  I found the stories interesting and fascinating, especially the encounter with Salvador Dali.   <br />I don't want to give away any of the suprises.  I found that he explained everything very well.  I was able to follow the biological ideas and I have only had one class in college biology.  I think if you have not had ANY biology knowledge you probably should get the basics down before reading this book.<br />But that shouldn't stop you from reading it. If you have any interest in how life started on Earth you have to read this book.	2002-07-12

I had just finished Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ (a must read BTW), and picked this one up because I thought it would discuss the period of time before Diamond's book really got into.  I didn't really get what I expected.<br />If you read the book discription on the back cover, it gives the impression that the book would cover human and hominoid development from about 5 million years ago until recent history i.e. 10,000 years ago.  <br />There are some good parts in this book.  I particularly liked how he gave an overview on how evolution works.  He explained things well and I was able to follow pretty easily despite  being a complete novice regarding the specifics on the theory.  I also liked the section on human evolution and how he explained the possible causes and effects of the spread of Homo sapiens.  His discussion on the overkill hypothesis was top notch.<br />However, this book is not without its flaws.  One major flaw for me was the fact that the main topic only takes up about half of the book.  There is a long chapter on mammal development, and at times he just simply lists creatures haphazardly.  It would've been nice to have a chart to identify the possible ancestors of animals that are alive today.  <br />A glossary would have been nice as well.  I got tired of trying to find the first time he mentioned poikilothermic animals just to name an example.  Yeah I know, I could've written down the definition, but is it too much to ask an author to do what most other authors do?  A bibliography would've been wonderful too.  There didn't seem to be that many references in the text, and I would've liked to see others sources for further reading.<br />The final problem for me was the fact that the book wasn't really about what the description on the back cover says.  For example, the first chapter is a detailed description on how the climate and atmosphere works on earth with a warning about excess CFC's and the depleting ozone.  Next he describes the different types of mammals and proceeds to seemingly describe every one that lived in the past and present.  There are so many names and descriptions that they kind of all blend together.  There is a chart, but it isn't detailed enough for you to really follow the author.  Finally, the last chapter is a plea for humanity to be careful and not kill off any more animal species.  <br />Now before people start assuming that I am anti-conservationist let me clarify.  I love animals as much [messed] up.  However, reading about those topics is not why I bought this book.  I bought it to read about the devlopment of Homo sapiens in the past, not a \\"save the ozone and don't kill the animals\\" plea, which really took up about a third of the book.<br />To summarize:  If you're looking for a strict account on human evolution then I wouldn't buy this book.  There is too many other topics that the author focuses on and really doesn't give that subject the just amount of pages in this book.	2002-06-30

Sure the easy explanation is that the Europeans had better technology and organization that the Native Americans could not overcome.  But, ever wonder why it wasn't the Inca who sailed over the Atlantic and conquered Europe?  Or why Africa was colonized by Europe, even though Africa is the birthplace of Homo sapiens?  Guns, Germs and Steel tries to answer this question.  <br />Diamond has written a facinating book trying to answer that question.  He argues that the early domestication of plants and large mammals (cows, horses, etc.) allowed civilizations in Europe and Asia to develop much faster than civilizations in the Americas, Africa or Austrailia.  Contributing to this (relatively) quick development is the fact that Eurasia's main axis is east-west, which allowed an easier spread of basic food production package from the Fertile Crescent to Europe, as well as the Chinese food production to spread throughout Asia as the local hunter-gatherer communities had to either adapt the sedentary way of life or get overrun by the more populous farming societies.  <br />I don't want to give much more away, since the author really explains the points of his thesis quite well.  Some reviews have criticized him as too repetitive.  I found it quite easy to follow his arguement since I didn't have to waste time trying to find the specific page from 10 chapters previous to refresh my memory.  <br />Also, as I read some of the previous reviews, I found that many of the negative reviews were based on two objections.  One deals with a sentence at the beginning of the book where he states that an average New Guinean is smarter than an average westerner because of our sedentary lifestyle vs. their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  Personally, I don't think there is a way to create a test which would prove or disprove that statement.  <br />Others have claimed that the author is too PC, and has made some Marxist statements.  I was going totry to refute those arguements, but instead I implore anyone reading this review to get the book and judge for yourself.  Is it perfect? No.  Are his theories air-tight?  No.  He admits this himself.  I encourage everyone to read this with an open mind.  You might be suprised.	2002-06-03

His style is very readable.  I liked his uses of metaphors and similies when describing what an ancient animal looked like or did.  While not a textbook and definately a bit thin for the amount of time he covered, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in our ancient past.  <BR>And while I do recommend the book, there are a few minor problems here.  The first one was the fact that there is no table to know what time period he is referring to.  I had to find one online, which is not that hard to do.  Also, near the end of the book, Mr. Fortey seemed to be more interested in the conflicts between the scientists than the history of life at times.  I understand that our knowledge of fossils and the new ways of dating and analyzing fossils causes us to re-examine older finds, but he basically didn't outline any development of the dinosaurs throughout the Mesozoic.  Instead, he focussed more on the experts' fights with one another.  I thought he did that too with the mammals during the Cenozoic, although not as much.  <BR>But those are minor problems that should not cause anyone to shy away from this book.  It is a good, well written book that any non-expert can read and understand.	2002-05-22

When I first saw it I thought it was simply about how Americans love fast food.  Boy was I wrong.  Instead Schlosser goes over everything fast food: from the history to where the meat comes from to the social and political power the fast food industry has.  And, for the most part, he scores a direct hit.  <br />There is a great deal to like in this book.  I particularly enjoyed the history of the fast food business.  I also found the sections on how the food is flavored (with \\"natural flavors\\") and the franchiser/franchisee sections eye-opening to say the least.  Another thing he did was not focus on the animals that the food is made from.  This has been done already numerous times prior to his book, and very well I might add.  Instead he focuses on the humans who work throughout the industry.  <br />However, there are a couple of points, and I know I'm probably nitpicking here, that I disagree with.  The main point everyone else has pointed out is how hard he is on the Republicans.  I agree that at times he mentions that \\"Mr. X, who is a Republican...\\" without really having to mention that he is a Republican at all.  He addresses this in the Afterword in the paperback edition.  Other points:  He interviews the teens working at McDonald's who buy all this expensive stuff.  Well guys, maybe you wouldn't have to work so many hours if you didn't buy the name brands.  Also he mentions about how all these farmers have been run out of business.  While I never want to see anyone unemployed, those people chose to be farmers in a society that continues to be more and more suburban and urban every day.  Like I said these points are pretty minor and didn't take away at all from the impact of the book.<br />... To sum up: This is a very interesting book that isn't dry at all.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in where exactly their food comes from and how the fast food industry treats its employees.  Its a pretty fast read and well documented with footnotes and bibliography as well.	2002-02-20

Jordan has fleshed out an amazing world with credible characters.  Paragraphs of descriptive prose.  Like another reviewer said, you feel like you are in that world.  People have compared it to Tolkien.  I guess in some basic way it can be similiar (good vs. ultimate evil, hero starts with humble beginnings), but it definately isn't one of those &quot;cookie cutter&quot; type of fantasy novel.  The female characters are much stronger, and you can argue that women run the show here.  The pace of the novel is excellent, as the protagonists are chased throughout the land by evil forces.  If you like fantasy books and you haven't read these books yet, shame on you! <BR>If and when you do start reading it, take you're time!  Jordan is on book 9 with maybe 2-3 books to go.  If you blow through them you get caught in the waiting game and have to re-read them to remember everything (not that that is a bad thing).  So sit back, open the book, and prepare to be transported to a magical, wonderful world.	2002-01-15

Hawking has a very engaging style and is very funny at times.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought the pictures added a great deal.  Sometimes the captions for them didn't explain much.  Its also difficult to express in a picture multidimensional branes.  I liked how he explained relativity and quantum mechanics, but honestly if you've read Brian Greene then Hawking's treatment is more of the same.  I think his main theme is to keep an open mind to all these potential theories (not including the Big Bang which the scientific community has shown its validity experimentally over and over again) and to give an overview of each of them.  He gives a brief bibliography, spliting it up into technical and non-technical books.  I would recomend this to anyone interested in the universe and the research about the universe.  If you come with a closed mind then don't waste your time.	2002-01-03

I can say now that Tad Williams is my favorite author.  Its been about 6hrs since I read the last page and in many ways I am still stunned.  The way he wrapped up the series is amazing, and, like many other reviews, I found my mouth dropping open as each chapter brought to light a new twist.   I read some of the &quot;professional&quot; reviews of the other volumes in the series, and it seems like they didn't get it (especially the Kirkus reviews).  His descriptions of the futuristic VR are amazing.  Its almost like he had a crystal ball and could see in the future.  Even the blurbs at the beginning of each chapter seemed to show a great deal of insight to the future of society on earth.   Well to sum up...don't punish yourself and not pick up this series.  Yes it is long (4000+ pages); But even if you are a die hard fantasy reader who really doesn't like science fiction that much, Williams has managed to write a wonderful series that walks the line between science fiction and fantasy beautifully.  Read these books-you will not be disappointed at all!	2001-06-05

He explains everything very clearly and concisely.  This would be a good book for someone interested in Linear Algebra to read.  The exercises are not simply computational, but he makes sure you understand the theory behind the math as well.  The odd answers are in the back of the book, and on some of them he will give you hints instead of the answer itself.  The one problem I had was that sometimes the exercises did not follow from the examples in the sections, but those were few and far between.  Another thing:  there are quite a few proofs as exercises so if you are not familiar with math proofs you may want to look at a book dedicated to proofs.	2000-12-08
US	52830880	R24QCMKX12W8BL	0697160998	280720912	Introduction to Vector Analysis	Books	4	4	4	N	N	good introduction	I just finished a class on Vector Analysis that used this book.  This book is good for those who are interested in vectors.  The authors start off with the basics and then move quickly to the more difficult lessons.  Basically this text treats the material the same as a calculus text does with a couple of exceptions.  First, the book moves more quickly than a calculus text, so if you are shaky on the first part i would advise having a calculus book there with you.  Second, this book shows the proofs in a more precise manner that the calculus text that I used (Stewart).  You study the same equations and theories, but now you have harder exercises to do at the end of the chapter (with most of the answers in the back of the book).  So I would recommend this book to those interested in vectors who are familiar with them.  Otherwise you may want to look at a calculus book to get up to speed first.	2000-12-08

From what I understand it is one of the first to be published.  It is a good overview of the progression of the Black Death in Europe, starting in Italy and working up to England.  As one other reviewer has said this is a popularized book:  there is no new research done.  He pretty much just follows the course the Black Death went throughout Europe.  The story of the village at the end was interesting, and I gives the reader a peek into how a typical farmer/villager would react and live thorough the horror. Overall I would recommend this book for someone interested in the Black Death but doesn't really care about the science behind the spread.	2000-11-24

I have to say that the book is very good.  The author takes time to prove all the theorems and there are about 10-15 exercises for each section with random solutions in the back.  Sometimes he skimps on the proofs and at times it is hard to follow his logic.  But overall I would recommend this for anyone interested in analysis who has a good background in calculus.  He starts with basic properties of numbers but then jumps pretty quickly into sequences, series and the rest of calculus.  Put your thinking caps on for this one!	2000-10-24

The book has great pictures of various cats acting out  various behaviors, what a kitten should look like at a certain age, and  even different parasites that a cat may get.  Also included is a list of  emergency situations and ways you can help your cat if he/she is injured.   This is a great book no cat owner should be without.	2000-06-08

This book is a great reference for people interested in the Roman Army.  Keppie describes the changes that took place within the army throughout the Republic.  He includes pictures and diagrams of how the army set up before  battle as well as pictures of the weapons and armor the legions were using  at that time.

The author looks at the primary sources critically and attempts to draw out the probable scenarios of the major points of the war.   Personally I thought he did a great job regarding that.  He has many maps  at the end of the book so you can find out where the major action is  happening without any problems.  Although I wouldn't recommend it for a  complete novice (i.e. someone who doesn't know a thing about ancient Rome)  I think it is an excellent introduction to the finer points of the Second  Punic War for anyone else.	2000-06-08

I'm not a big mystery reader, but I really enjoyed this novel.  It takes place in England in the later Middle Ages, where a group of traveling actors stop at a small  village to perform a religious play called a morality play.  The actors  discover that a murder has recently been committed so they decide to  research the murder and put a play about that instead.        This is a  short book but the author really fleshes out the characters well and you  really feel like you are discovering clues along with the actors.  The  ending is a suprise as well.  I would recommend this to all myster fans and  to anyone interested in reading about the everyday life of a person living  in the Middle Ages.	2000-06-06

This along with Scullard's other book that covers from the Gracchi to Nero make a great pair that covers the entire Roman Republic plus the first few emperors.   The book is pretty easy to read, and the author has provided an extensive  bibliography and series of endnotes for the reader who wants more.  I high  recommend this book to anyone interested in Roman history.	2000-06-02

The teacher used this translation.  I was so impressed I bought the book myself.  Ciardi has made this text accessible  to everyone, with plenty of notes and diagrams to keep you from getting  lost as you journey with Dante to Hell, Purgatory and Heaven.

Pelikan discusses each doctrine and shows the evolution of the Christian (and Heretical) beliefs.  This book is not for a beginner.  I  think you need to have a good grasp of church history and the major  theolgians' core beliefs.  This book (part 1 of a series) is invaluable for  the theologian or student of church history.	2000-05-28

The crux of his arguement is that the generation of Caesar, Pompey, et al did not realize that their actions would cause the Republic to end.  He cites many examples of senators who did not heel to Caesar, Pompey, or Crassus.  In fact, most of the time their political enemies got the better of them.  He examines the lists of the magistrates during this time, as well as different court battles.  He stresses the factionality of Roman politics without becoming confusing with the different factions. The only problem I have with his premise is that he never really explains why &quot;politics as usual&quot; still contributed to the fall of the Republic and the rise of Augustus.  This book is recommended to anyone interested in this time period of Rome who wants to read a different perspective on the events	1997-08-29
