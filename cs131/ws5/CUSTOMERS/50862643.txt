It is, instead, a narrow, but detailed and incisive study of Lincoln's exercise of executive power between his election in 1860 and his assassination in 1865.  This is important because, as author Philip Shaw Paludan explains: &quot;No president had larger challenges than Abraham Lincoln.&quot;  And Paludan proceeds to state the obvious, that Lincoln was &quot;responsible for two enormous accomplishments that are part of folk legend as well as fact.  He saved the Union and he freed the slaves.&quot;  No other president did so much in so little time, and Paludan explains why.  As a result, within its limited confines, this book is excellent!  <br />Paludan demonstrates in the chapter entitled &quot;Assembling the Cast: Winter 1860-61,&quot; that Lincoln, as president-elect, was a shrewd politician.  According to Paludan: &quot;Lincoln could be effective only if he unified the six-year-old Republican party,&quot; so one of his first appointments was &quot;his strongest party rival,&quot; William Seward, Senator from New York, as secretary of state.  As political payback for delivering Pennsylvania to the Republicans in 1860, Lincoln was obliged to appoint the notoriously-corrupt Simon Cameron Secretary of War.  To counter that stench, Lincoln named as his secretary of the navy Connecticut newspaper editor Gideon Welles, who &quot;had a glowing reputation for honesty.&quot; Within a year, Cameron also proved to be incompetent, and, in 1862, Lincoln replaced him with Edwin Stanton, who proved to be not only a man of great integrity but a very capable manager as well.   It proved to be one of the most talented cabinets in American history, although Paludan makes clear that its operations were not always harmonious, most notably during the &quot;cabinet crisis&quot; of December 1862.<br />With most of the executive departments in capable hands, Lincoln &quot;involved himself actively in matters of strategy,&quot; claiming &quot;`war power' authority to use his office to the limits.&quot;  Lincoln's focus on military affairs was essential because the Civil War generally went badly for the Union for the first year. Paludan ably demonstrates that even while Lincoln struggled to find generals who had both the talents and temperament to be successful, the Union was &quot;forging the resources of war,&quot; which eventually proved decisive.  Gen. George McClellan was a brilliant military administrator but proved much too cautious in the field, appalled by the &quot;mangled corpses and the poor suffering wounded.   Lincoln eventually lost confidence in McClellan, and he had to be replaced.  One of McClellan's eventual successors, Gen. George Meade, won the great victory at Gettysburg in July 1863, but the Union did fully gain the initiative in the field until Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who won an equally great victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi almost on the same day, was appointed general in chief in March 1864.                       <br />Lincoln's original war aim was merely to restore the Union.  But the costs, human and material, of the war's first two years, made eradication of slavery a necessity.  Following the battle of Antietam in September 1862, which was a &quot;tactical draw but a strategic victory&quot; for the Union, Lincoln announced the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.  The issue then became: What was to be done with the former slaves?  In December, Lincoln proposed a constitutional amendment for the federal government to pay to colonize any blacks who wished to emigrate, but blacks &quot;rejected it, abolitionists had condemned it,&quot; and this &quot;doubtful solution&quot; was beyond the practical realities of the time.  Even while the war continued to rage, the prospective problems of reconstruction never were far from Lincoln's mind, and, according to Paludan, this difficult issue increasingly divided the president from radical Republicans. <br />Paludan writes that, while the radicals favored confiscation of land which had prospered from slave labor, Lincoln believed in &quot;peaceful, gradual, compensated emancipation.&quot;   Lincoln opposed the harsh remedy of confiscation and believed that the Constitution permitted him to free the slaves only &quot;in places where war was being made.&quot;  The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 potentially freed 3 million slaves but did not mention colonization or compensated emancipation.   Nevertheless, the emancipation issue proved controversial.  Solidly Republican New England remained largely committed to the war, but, according to Paludan: &quot;Especially in the regions of the Middle West settled from the South and in cities where job competition existed between the races, people resented the idea of fighting in order to free blacks.&quot;  <br />Equally controversial was the Emancipation Proclamation's &quot;arming of black freedom fighters.&quot;  According to Paludan, &quot;Lincoln and his party clearly were committed to Union and to emancipation and to the belief that the two were linked indissolubly by the need for black soldiers.&quot;  Almost 180,000 black troops were serving in Union armies by the end of the war.  Lincoln was very conscious of the importance of maintaining the national moral, and, in Paludan's view, northern whites increasingly recognized the benefits of having black soldiers defend the Union.<br />According to Paludan, the Union's victory was in large part a result of Lincoln's &quot;devotion to and mastery of the political-constitutional institutions of his time.&quot;  Some Civil War buffs and many general readers are likely to find this book rather dry because it focuses on the science of politics.  But, as Paludan writes, the preservation of the Union &quot;was achieved chiefly through an extraordinary outreach of national authority.&quot;  This book is an exceptionally thoughtful account of the exercise of executive powerduring the most serious crisis in American history.	2001-07-06
US	50862643	RVXAUTPULE6ML	0316774707	318063863	Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America	Books	4	21	33	N	N	A Balanced Account of an Imbalanced Era	Notwithstanding the harshness of the title, I found this book to be a generally-balanced, thoughtful account of the intense and extensive anti-Communist campaign in the United States which flourished from the mid-1940s through the mid-1950s. Now 50 years after the fact, the study of McCarthyism remains worthwhile for two reasons: As author Ellen Schrecker shrewdly observes, McCarthyism both predated and outlasted the heyday of Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, which lasted only from 1950 until 1954; and McCarthyism reached practically every aspect of American life. It is virtually impossible to understand the history of the United States during the first decade after World War II (which also, of course, was the first decade of the Cold War) without careful reference to the phenomenon of McCarthyism. Somewhat to my surprise, this book is largely free of ideological cant, even as Schrecker carefully recounts the various ways in which McCarthyism distorted American politics in the early years of the Cold War, and I found her concluding chapter on the impact of McCarthyism to be especially effective. <br />Much of the copious background material Schrecker presents is both useful and interesting, although it takes her 150 pages to get to the mid-1940s, which is the ostensible beginning of the era of McCarthyism. Schrecker's formulation is intelligent and straightforward: By 1946, the United States was engaged in the growing Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union; McCarthyism was the home front of the Cold War; and it took little imagination to make American Communists and anyone who was or ever had been associated with them the principal targets on the home front..... <br />The focus of this book generally is events within the United States, but Schrecker does not whitewash the horrors perpetrated by Stalin's Soviet Union, nor the threat it posed to the United States. To the contrary, Schrecker is candid in reporting that, even during World War II, when the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were allies, the Soviets engaged in extensive anti-American espionage, the most egregious example of which was the passage of the secrets of the Manhattan Project, which allowed the Soviet Union to develop its own atomic bomb in 1949, &quot;a year or two sooner than it otherwise would have.&quot; I believe that Schrecker's main premise, however, is that the dangerous international situation in the late 1940s and 1950s was conflated into a vicious hunt for subversives within the United States grotesquely out of proportion to any real domestic threat which might have existed. The record presented here of illegal conduct by the F.B.I. and its conscious exaggeration of the danger posed by Communism on the home front is what makes this book an important cautionary tale.	2001-07-05

There is the one-sentence version: The evil Axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and imperial Japan attempted to conquer the world, and was defeated by the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and their allies.  Many wonderful books have been written about the major, turning-point campaigns and battles.  And there now are many individual stories of heroism and sacrifice, which make up what might be characterized as the micro-history of the conflict.  Hampton Sides's Ghost Soldiers is of the latter variety.   In chronological order, it begins with the defeat of the American forces in the Philippines in 1942, which resulted in the largest surrender in U.S. military history, takes the prisoners of war through the brutal Bataan &quot;death march,&quot; follows them through nearly three years of insufferable captivity in prisoner of war camps, reports that the Japanese were preparing to slaughter the surviving prisoners as they retreated, and narrates the fascinating and stirring story of the liberation of about 500 American and British POWS by a small force of American Rangers and Filipino guerrillas in January 1945.        <br />In Sides's view, several factors accounted for the near-unspeakably harsh conditions to which Allied prisoners of war in the Pacific were subjected.  Sides ably demonstrates that, for cultural reasons, the Japanese generally held their prisoners in contempt.  According to their Military Field Code, Japanese soldiers who fell into enemy hands &quot;brought irrevocable shame&quot; to themselves and their families.  That attitude could not be expunged when Japanese soldiers were assigned to prison camps, and this explains, but certainly does not excuse, the harsh discipline, which included beatings, torture, and occasionally random acts of murder, imposed by the Japanese.  The camps, themselves, often were poorly equipped with medical and sanitary facilities, and exposure to the elements and natural pathogens made tropical diseases rampant.  For instance, the camp where most of the Bataan POWS were marched was planned for about 25,000 troops, but the actual number of prisoners held there began at closer to 100,000.  It is nearly miraculous that anyone survived. <br />By late 1944, most of the Allied POWS held at Cabanatuan had died or had been taken to Japan to serve as slave laborers, and only about 500, mostly men with severe psychiatric disorders, dysentery, and tuberculosis, survived.  When the American military command obtained reports that the Japanese were in the process of annihilating the remaining prisoners, a plan was rapidly improvised to send about 200 American Rangers and Filipino guerrillas to Cabanatuan to rescue the POWS.  This may not have been, as the subtitle asserts, &quot;World War II's Most Dramatic Mission&quot; (I consider that merely publisher's hyperbole), but the story of the indomitable prisoners is inspiring, and the chapters devoted to the rescue mission are very exciting.     <br />Books of this type are not without their critics.  An example of the most serious criticism recently appeared in The New York Times, where the reviewer wrote that that &quot;Sides's effort to expand gratuitously a brief chapter in Army history is an egregious of the recent trend to milk every drop of drama from World War II, a conflict whose realities are heroic enough unembellished.&quot;  If Sides exaggerated or &quot;embellished&quot; the drama of the Ranger raid on the Cabanatuan prison camp, he committed a serious error of judgment and reportorial ethics.  But the suggestion that this &quot;brief chapter in Army history&quot; does not deserve book-length attention strikes me as ungenerous and short-sighted.  It is true that the events at Cabanatuan in January 1945 did not determine the outcome of the war in the Pacific, but they did illustrate some ofthe conflict's principal themes.  I have read that American veterans of World War II are dying at the rate of 1,000 per day.  In 20 years, practically all of them will be dead.  And then, the stories of this great generation quite literally will pass into history.  I am in complete favor of the publication of every possible book about World War II, especially first-person accounts and those in which the participants tell their stories to professional writers.  Only in that way will succeeding generations have the fullest possible record of what happened during this horrific conflict.  In one hundred years, students will still ask: Why did 50 million people die in the world war of the 1930s and 1940s?  Hampton Sides's Ghost Soldiers offers a partial answer to that question, and that is why books such as this are so valuable.	2001-07-03
US	50862643	R3CNMSRWQ6WZ61	0671890913	686500362	The Longest Day: The Classic Epic of D-Day	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The Day for which the World Waited Four Years	This is a classic account of D-Day, June 6, 1944, the day on which the Allies invaded Hitler's Europe at Normandy on the northern coast of France, over four years after the French had ignominiously surrendered to Germany during the first year of World War II.  With the benefit of over 50 years' hindsight, the successful D-Day invasion may now appear to be anticlimactic.  Although, as Ryan observes, the Germans had to anticipate the possibility that the long-awaited invasion could occur at nearly any point along 800 miles of coast of the Netherlands and France and at virtually any time that the always-unpredictable weather over the English Channel permitted, a German intelligence source had corrected predicted that the invasion would take place at Normandy on June 6.  But the Germans had convinced themselves that the Allies would wait for perfect weather conditions.  Ryan succinctly reports General Dwight Eisenhower's decision on the night of June 5 to take a chance that there would be a short break in the weather.  The order to proceed with the invasion was given, and, because by June 1944 the Allies had virtually total naval and air superiority in and over the Channel, the Germans were unaware of the massing of the invasion forces on that night.  I found Ryan's terse, understated description of a German coastal observer's reaction when the 5000-ship invasion fleet appeared off the Norman coast early in the morning of June 6 to be gloriously exciting; when the German officer calls headquarters to report that the invasion has begun and is asked \\"what way are [the] ships heading?\\", he replies, \\"Right at me.\\"  This is simply one of the greatest battle stories of all time!    <br />As Ryan ably demonstrates, the Allies' success on D-Day was, in fact, the result of thousands of acts of individual achievement and heroism.  Like the glider-borne troops who landed behind enemy lines during the night and seized key roads and bridges to prevent German reinforcements from reaching the five invasion beaches; the paratroopers whose radios, bazookas, mortars, and ammunition landed in marshes and had to be retrieved by diving into the chilly water before they could proceed to their objectives; and the 120 underwater demolition experts who landed on the beaches first to clear paths through minefields and obstacles for the waves of assault troops who followed.  <br />There are many moments of life-and-death struggle.  At the end of the book, Ryan includes a short \\"Note on Casualties,\\" in which he writes that American casualties during the 24-hour period of the assault totaled 6,603 killed, wounded, missing, and captured, which seems remarkably low considering the vast size of the invasion.  Nevertheless, each death was a personal tragedy.  According to Ryan, the Germans \\"had organized a bloody welcome for the Allied troops.\\"  The overnight airborne operation, which involved 13,000 American paratroopers, was successful but at considerable cost.  Many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones.  The lucky ones just had a long walk to get where they were supposed to be.  But Ryan reports that the Germans had flooded large expanses of low-lying farmland and countryside surrounding the coast, and a number of unlucky paratroopers landed in the water and drowned.  The landings on the beaches were equally perilous.  Ryan writes: \\"Seasick men, already exhausted by the long hours spent on the transports and in the assault boats, found themselves fighting for their lives in water which was often over their heads.\\"   In one company landing on Omaha Beach, \\"[l]ess than a third of the men survived the bloody walk from the boats to the edge pf the beach.\\"  In one force of Rangers assigned to assault a 100-foot-high cliff, only 90 of the original 225 were still able to bear arms at the end of the day.   <br />Ryan's approach is essentially journalistic, but the events he records occasionally inspire him to wax poetic.  About the British Second Army, Ryan writes: \\"They were assaulting not just beaches but bitter memories - memories of Munich and Dunkirk, of one hateful and humiliating retreat after another, of countless devastating bombing raids, of dark days when they had stood alone.  With them were the Canadians with a score of their own to settle for the bloody losses at Dieppe.  And with them, too, were the French, fierce and eager on this homecoming morning.\\"   But, sometimes, all Ryan needs to do is report the facts.  At the end of the day, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the commander of the German defenses, is asked: \\"Sir, do you think we can drive them back?\\" and he responds, \\"I hope we can.  I've always succeeded up to now.\\"  In fact, Ryan writes: \\"From this day on the Third Reich had less than one year to live.\\"  <br />In some respects, this book is a curious account of a massive, unprecedented battle whose success depended largely upon organization and planning at the command level.  Ryan devotes only a few pages to the Allies' remarkable logistical preparations for the invasion by 200,000 men with massive amounts of equipment and to the Germans' equally-clever, if ultimately unsuccessful, efforts to prevent a successful landing.  Indeed, most of Ryan's narrative takes the form of a series of relatively short vignettes of the experiences of individuals, officers and enlisted men, Allied and German, on this momentous day.  Other books about D-Day, such as John Keegan's Six Armies in Normandy:  From D-Day to the Liberation of Paris and Stephen E. Ambrose's D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II are more comprehensive.  But it is inconceivable that any student of World War II can have a full appreciation of what happened on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944 without reading Cornelius Ryan's The Longest Day.	2001-04-21
US	50862643	RU4Y0RHXFUCZD	0684844168	38409771	Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War	Books	3	15	23	N	N	Star Wars and a Lot (Too Much) More	Frances FitzGerald's Fire in the Lake: The Vietnamese and the Americans in Vietnam, which won the Pulitzer Prize, was one of the best books written about the Vietnam War during the conflict, and her America Revised: History Schoolbooks in the Twentieth Century was a splendid study of how Americans think and write about the past.  So I was, quite frankly, a bit disappointed by this book about President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (\\"Star Wars\\").  I am, quite frankly, inclined to agree with what I perceive to be FitzGerald's main premises: Reagan never had a clue about the technical difficulties involved in devising and implementing a ballistic-missile defense system; the cost of the program would have been astronomical, even by American defense-spending standards; and, even if S.D.I. had been deployed, it never would have accomplished the one thing Reagan promised: Protecting the American people from the threat posed by nuclear weapons.  But FitzGerald meanders.  In an \\"Author's Note\\" at the beginning of the book, FitzGerald writes: \\"This book began with my interest in the appeal Reagan had for the American public and the direct connection he made to the American imagination.\\"  Well enough.  But FitzGerald then asserts that she chose to focus on S.D.I. because \\"it was surely his greatest rhetorical triumph.\\"  FitzGerald never establishes the validity of that premise.           <br />Preparing to write a book about public policy requires the author to ask herself: How much context is necessary?  In this instance, I believe most readers would have accepted as given \\"Reagan's ignorance of policy issues, his disengagement from the work of government, his distance from other people.\\"  She could, therefore, have started with chapter four, entitled, \\"Space Defense Enthusiasts.\\"  The 1980 Republican national campaign's defense platform called for the U.S. \\"to achieve overall military and technical superiority over the Soviet Union\\" and \\"to create a strategic and civil defense which would protect the American people against nuclear war at least as well as the Soviet population is protected.\\"  But missile defense was deliberately kept out of Reagan's speeches during the campaign.  In October 1981, the White House announced that it was pursuing research and development of ground- and space based defenses \\"but today ballistic missile defense technology  is not at the state where it could provide an adequate defense against Soviet missiles.\\"  That official policy statement, which was reported in the national media, is the effective starting point of FitzGerald's study and establishes the principal issue for the remainder of the book: Between October 1981 and the end of the Reagan administration in January 1989, did ballistic missile defense technology advance to the where point where it could have provided an adequate defense against Soviet missiles?         <br />Reagan had been long convinced, perhaps in defiance of the facts, that the Soviets had achieved nuclear-weapons superiority.  In January 1982, a small group of missile-defense advocates met with the president. According to FitzGerald, some participants believed Reagan was committed to, at the very least, a research program, while others were of the opinion that the \\"White House response to their work was distinctly and surprisingly cool.\\"  One concern might have been cost: During the campaign, Reagan had promised tax cuts, a balanced budget, and higher defense spending.  The administration was planning to spend almost $1.5 trillion in five years for its defense build-up.  But, according to FitzGerald: \\"Reagan had taken to saying, `Defense is not a budget item.  You spend what you need.'\\"  <br />Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative in a speech on March 23, 1983.  In FitzGerald's view, Reagan never gave the technical issues much personal consideration; \\"his job, as he saw it, was to sell [his administration's] policies to the public.\\"  The concept apparently simmered for most of the next one and one-half years.  The Pentagon created an independent entity to study missile defense early in 1984, but, according to FitzGerald, \\"many in the Pentagon, and in particular the [research and development] chiefs, had voiced considerable skepticism about the President`s project.\\"   What followed was a period of technical controversies known as the \\"science wars.\\"  FitzGerald writes that, during the 1984 presidential campaign, Democrat Walter Mondale \\"condemned Star Wars as a dangerous hoax that would cost untold billions, speed up the arms race and fail to provide any real protection.\\"  But S.D.I. was not a major issue in that election, and Reagan, of course, crushed Mondale to win a second term.       <br />The technical debate continued, and opponents of S.D.I. were denounced by Reagan administration officials as \\"traditional thinkers\\" and people \\"congenitally opposed to new ideas.\\"   One of the traditionalists was former President Nixon who expressed the essential problem in a nutshell: \\"With 10,000 of those damned things [nuclear warheads] there is no defense.\\"  The director of the Pentagon's S.D.I. office was forced to concede that \\"though Reagan's vision was the goal 'we may well find it unachievable,\\" and, according to FitzGerald, the chairman of the Defense Technologies Study Team concluded that no missile defense stem could defend the total U.S. population: \\"There is no such thing as a nuclear umbrella.\\"  <br />If, as FitzGerald puts it, \\"an umbrella defense of the United States was a virtual impossibility,\\" what accounts for S.D.I.'s continuing vitality through the end of the Reagan administration?   Reagan apparently believed that, even if significant reductions of offensive weapons could be negotiated, missile defense was necessary \\"as a safety valve against cheating.\\"  Others wanted to have S.D.I. available as a bargaining chip to be used in those negotiations.   And others supported it simply as a research program.  FitzGerald asserts that S.D.I. was the first military program Congress ever funded \\"knowing full well that what the public expected from it could not possibly be achieved.\\"  The annual cost for research alone was $3 billion.<br />In arms-control discussions in the mid-1980s, missile defense was a contentious issue.  The official Soviet position was that a missile-defense system in space might, in fact, be used for offensive purposes, to launch a first strike.  It is equally clear that the Soviets did not want to be pressured to undertake the expense of researching the enormously complicated technical issues.  (During one summit meeting, Gorbachev told Reagan: \\"I think you're wasting money.  I don't think it will work.  But if that's what you want to do, go ahead....We're moving in another direction....And we think we can do it less expensively and with greater effectiveness.\\")  After the end of the Cold War, Reaganites took the position that the challenges created by the Reagan defense build-up, including research into S.D.I., had pushed the Soviet economy into crisis.  There does not appear to have been any real possibility of developing and deploying an effective missile defense system in the 1980s.  <br />Whether one accepts or rejects FitzGerald's main premise probably depends upon the reader's ideology.  Reagan admirers, who believe that his efforts to rebuild American defenses helped end of the Cold War, will energetically reject FitzGerald's perspective.  Those who believe that S.D.I. was a costly exercise in futility probably will be embrace her indictment.  If I had been FitzGerald's editor, I would have encouraged her to reduce the length of the text from about 500 pages to under 350 and to focus on the following questions: (1) Was effective ballistic missile defense technologically feasible in the mid-1980s? (2) What would have been the cost of development and deployment? and (3) If deployed, what would S.D.I. have protected?  FitzGerald suggests that the short answers to those questions were: (1) Probably no; (2) At least $1 trillion; and (3) At best, S.D.I. would have offered some protection for American strategic forces, but it never would have provided population defense.  According to FitzGerald, the Reagan administration was not honest with the American people about any of those essential points.  That, in my opinion, should have been the narrow theme of her book.	2001-04-20
US	50862643	R3EVEMC6CCIXVJ	0880642378	842465724	The Last Parallel: A Marine's War Journal	Books	4	28	28	N	N	War in a Very Cold Place	This is the third first-person account of the Korean War I have reviewed here during the last year (the others were James Brady, The Coldest War : A Memoir of Korea, review date May 27, 2000, and James R. Owen, Colder Than Hell : A Marine Rifle Company at Chosin Reservoir. review date December 8, 2000), and I have enjoyed all three.  No war is pretty, but the Korean War was especially ugly: Most of the fighting took place over cold and barren ground from World War I-style trenches; the enemy, North Koreans and Chinese, was tough and relentless; and the conflict ended in a cruel stalemate that essentially persists to this day.  The author of this memoir, Corporal (later Sergeant) Martin Russ describes Seoul, the capital of South Korea, as \\"a huge trash heap,\\" and the countryside as \\"a frozen patchwork of fields and rice paddies.\\"     <br />By the time Russ arrived in Korea in December 1952, the war had been in progress for two and one-half years.  Although Russ was trained to be a small-arms mechanic, he informs us that all marines underwent advanced infantry training before being sent to Korea, and he spent most of his time as a rifleman in trenches.  Five days after he arrived in at his post in the field in January 1953, he wrote: \\"I consider it an honor to be here.\\"   It was, however, a hard life.  An occasional chocolate chip cookie is balanced by \\"an obscene putrescence in one of the cans which is labeled `Ham and Eggs.'\\"  According to Russ: \\"It is impossible to keep anything clean; showers of dirt fall each time an incoming shell lands anywhere nearby.\\"  At one point, Russ describes himself and his fellows as \\"bearded, filthy, and stinking.\\"  As a result, Russ writes: \\"The portable showers [were] a real luxury.\\"  <br />The trenches of the Chinese forces were no more than 200 yards away, and firefights occurred every night.  The fighting often lasted only for a few minutes (in one instance, Russ writes: \\"The fire fight lasted for at least five minutes - a hell of a prolonged encounter for this type of situation\\"), but it could be terrifying.  Even when they weren't fighting, the marines were almost continuously exposed to danger.  They often patrolled through heavily-mined rice paddies, looking for \\"line jumpers,...Korean or Chinese spies that had gotten through\\" the Allies' main line of resistance.  The possibility of imminent combat was so great that it was, according to Russ, \\"mandatory to carry one's weapon when outside\\" at all times.  On one occasion, a Chinese mortar round lands in the middle of a group of marines, and Russ reports that another marines described the scene as a \\"slaughterhouse.\\"  On another occasion, after \\"heavy assaults\\" by the Chinese on several successive nights, Russ characterizes the marine casualties as \\"appalling.\\"  Russ's crude drawings and diagrams help to illustrate the points he is making.   <br />Russ writes revealingly about his peers: \\"As a marine, one almost feels obliged to conceal any emotion except anger;\\" and \\"The average marine...hates sailors, is not averse to beating up homosexuals, and loathes civilians.\\"  It probably was inevitable that some marines would turn that anger inward, and Ross reports: \\"Suicide is not a rare occurrence in the Corps.\\"  According to Russ, \\"the men of the Corps are the most skillful killers in the world.\\"  Russ describes one instance in which a marine is killed while hunting for souvenirs, and this is the verdict of one of his peers: \\"He was a fool.  I don't feel sorry for him; only for his folks.\\"  <br />Russ's writing often is colorful, and he clearly has a gift for observation.  However, like the Brady and Owen books, his account makes few references to the geopolitical struggle at the heart of the Korean War.  And readers wanting to learn about the big picture of the early Cold War also must look elsewhere.  But I now believe that there is considerable value in reading about the individual infantryman's experience in this or any other conflict, andRuss's battlefield memoir is one of the best from the Korean War.  Thanks to Brady, Owen, and Russ, this is no longer the \\"forgotten war.\\"	2001-04-18

George Patton may have been the most successful battlefield commander of World War II.  And he had a reputation for honesty and fiercely-expressed opinions.  So I was disappointed by this relatively slim volume of reminiscences about his experiences in Africa, Sicily, Italy, and western Europe during that conflict.  The introduction written by Douglas Southall Freeman, the great biographer of Robert E. Lee, tells us that Patton \\"kept a full diary from July, 1942, until Dec. 5, 1945,\\" four days before his fatal accident,\\" and Southall asserts that the diary entries are \\"always candid, frequently critical, and occasionally caustic.\\"  I regret to report that I did not find that to be the case.  The notoriously fiery Patton temper is rarely on display here, which prompts me to suspect that the diary entries were heavily sanitized for publication.  (Patton's widow was the original editor this book, which raises my level of suspicion.)  It is possible, however, that Patton, himself, exercised extreme discretion in deciding what to commit to writing.  In either case, the result generally makes for dull reading.<br />Some of what Patton has to say is intriguing.  Patton frequently compares the casualties of the Third U.S. Army, which he commanded in France, and those of the enemy, and German casualties are consistently much higher.  Patton's nickname was Old Blood and Guts,\\" but there is, in fact, reason to believe that he was more economical with his men's lives than the conventional wisdom occasionally suggests.  Patton's competition with the British commander Field Marshal Montgomery is frequently on display.  In August 1944, Patton reports that Montgomery wanted all American forces to stop their advance across France so Montgomery's could make a \\"dagger thrust with the Twenty-First Army Group at the heart of Germany.\\"  Patton's colleague Gen. Omar Bradley was skeptical, stating that it would be \\"more like a `butter-knife thrust.\\"  In November 1944, Patton was visited in the field by Averell Harriman, the United States' Ambassador to the Soviet Union, who told Patton Josef Stalin had said: \\"The Red Army could not have conceived and certainly could not have executed the advance made by the Third Army across France.\\"  A lengthy footnote reports that, in December 1944, Patton ordered his chaplain to prepare a \\"prayer for good weather\\" because the general was \\"tired of these soldiers having to fight mud and floods as well as Germans.\\"  When the chaplain attempted to demur by saying, \\"Sir, it's going to take a pretty thick rug for that kind of praying,\\" Patton replied: \\"I don't care if it takes the flying carpet, I want the praying done.\\"  According to Patton, when he saw Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, the Allies Supreme Commander, shortly after the Battle of the Bulge, Eisenhower never mentioned the efforts of the Third Army, and Patton clearly was hurt.  (In March 1945, Patton clearly was pleased when Eisenhower attended a Third Army briefing and was \\"most complimentary.\\")   And Patton shows no remorse for the notorious incident when he slapped a soldier in a hospital who clearly was suffering from a psychiatric disorder.  <br />But the chapter on the Battle of the Bulge is more typical.  It contains some useful detail about one of Patton's most successful operations, but it is almost complete devoid of color and personality.   For instance, one passage states: \\"On [Dec. 31, 1944], the Germans made seventeen counter-attacks against us, all of which were repulsed.\\"  Is that all Patton had to say?   A couple of pages later, he adds: \\"At midnight on the night of December 31, all guns in the Third Army fired rapid fire for twenty minutes on the Germans as a New Year's greeting.  When the firing ceased, our forward observers stated that they could hear the Germans screaming in the woods.\\"  Now that's interesting!                    <br />Patton's account of his campaigns during World War II is an important document.  I only regret that moreof Patton's personality did not come through here.  One other interesting historical note: The footnotes, which are very helpful, were prepared by Col. Paul D. Harkins, who served as Patton's Deputy Chief of Staff.  After his promotion to general, Harkins commanded the United States's forces in Vietnam in the early 1960s.  Harkins clearly was a better staff officer than a commander.	2001-04-16
US	50862643	R185U4BVTNGWK3	0671499017	972608839	Eisenhower The President	Books	4	11	11	N	N	An Able President for the High Cold War	This is the second of a two-volume biography of Dwight Eisenhower, the great World War II military administrator who was elected president in 1952 without any experience in elective office and served two full terms, one of only five presidents in this century to do so.  Author Stephen Ambrose, whose Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869 became a bestseller just days after it was published last August, writes authoritatively here about a president whom he clearly admires.  This is a comprehensive study of an eight-year period which is sometimes portrayed as a mid-20th century era of good feelings.  As Ambrose ably demonstrates, it was, in fact, a period marked by frequent international crises, as well as by strong undercurrents of change in American life, most notably in the area of civil rights.<br />The Cold War was at its height in the 1950s, and Ambrose devotes a great detail of space to diplomatic and military affairs.  According to Ambrose, Eisenhower intended to \\"continue the policies of containment, foreign aid, and Europe first,\\" but opposition to Eisenhower's program came most frequently from within his own party, beginning with battles over Eisenhower's appointees to key State Department positions at the beginning of his first term.  Some of the most interesting passages in this book involve Ambrose's presentation of the frequent conflicts between the moderate Eisenhower Republicans and the \\"Old Guard,\\" which was practically hysterical in its opposition to the threat posed by international Communism, real and supposed.  Ambrose's discussion of Eisenhower's consistent opposition to increased military spending is fascinating.  This is one area in which Eisenhower displayed real leadership, even when the president's position was not popular.  By1960, one important issue was whether Richard Nixon and John Kennedy would spend more on national defense.  (Ambrose makes clear Eisenhower's disappointment with the choice the American people were offered in that election: Eisenhower, one of the giants of World War II, would have to turn over executive power at the height of the Cold War to a former junior officer, either Nixon or Kennedy.)  In his Farewell Address, Eisenhower warned of the dangers posed by the creation of a military-industrial complex.  Only a president with Eisenhower's impeccable military credentials could credibly have said that.  Ambrose leaves no doubt about Eisenhower's determination to decrease international tensions, especially in Europe, and most especially the threat of nuclear war.  For the most part, Eisenhower's management of the frequent international crises during his administration was deft.   <br />One Republican with whom Eisenhower publicly refused to dispute was Sen. Joseph McCarthy.  According to Ambrose, one of Eisenhower's reasons for avoiding conflict with the notorious witch-hunter was personal: \\"I just won't get into a pissing contest with that skunk.\\"   But Ambrose also writes: \\"Eisenhower was more on McCarthy's side than not on the issue of Communism in government.  It was McCarthy's methods he disapproved of, not his goals or his analysis.\\"  Ambrose concludes: \\"Eisenhower's cautious, hesitant approach - or nonapproach - to the McCarthy issue did the President's reputation no good, and much harm.\\"  <br />Eisenhower also was often criticized for presiding over a British-style cabinet government in which he purportedly delegated too much responsibility to his department heads.  Ambrose makes clear that Eisenhower was keenly interested in the big issues facing the State, Defense, and Treasury departments, but the record presented here indicates that Eisenhower had much less interest in domestic affairs.  The creation of the interstate highway system probably was the principal domestic achievement of the Eisenhower administration.   <br />Civil rights was an issue which begged for presidential leadership. Eisenhower rightly deserves credit for appointing Earl Warren Chief Justice of the United States, and Warren, of course, presided over the unanimous 1954 decision declaring separate-but-equal public education systems to be unconstitutional.  But Ambrose makes clear that, except on the issue of voting rights, Eisenhower refused to be pushed into the forefront in civil rights.  Eisenhower was a product of the late-19th century (he was born in 1890), and this is one area in which he failed to grow as president.  On occasion, according to Ambrose, Eisenhower could be \\"bumbling\\" and \\"ineffective.\\"  With regard to civil rights, Eisenhower simply failed to lead.  According to Ambrose: \\"In the field of civil rights, [Eisenhower] felt he had done as well as could be done.\\" The judgment of history disagrees.      <br />Ambrose makes very effective use of primary sources, including Eisenhower's diaries.  The text includes numerous references to Eisenhower's assessments of colleagues and subordinates, political rivals, other public figures international leaders, and some of them are cutting.  Although Nixon loyally served as Eisenhower's vice president for eight years, they never were close, and Eisenhower was not enthusiastic about Nixon's candidacy in 1960.  During that campaign, when Nixon was trying to make the most of his experience as vice president, Eisenhower told a reporter it would take him a week to think of a major contribution Nixon had made to the administration.  But if Nixon had followed Eisenhower's advice and had refused to debate Kennedy, he might well have been elected in 1960.        <br />Ambrose may admire his subject too much.  To cite just one example, although Ambrose writes that \\"friends as well as critics worried about how unprepared [Eisenhower] was for the presidency,\\" the author, himself, asserts that, in foreign affairs, Eisenhower \\"was undoubtedly the best prepared man ever elected to the Presidency.\\"  But I believe Ambrose is correct when he observes at the beginning of his chapter assessing the Eisenhower presidency: \\"To say that Eisenhower was right about this or wrong about that is to do little more than announce one's own political position.\\"  That is Ambrose's justification for examining Eisenhower's years in the White House \\"in his own terms.\\"       <br />When this book was published in 1984, Ambrose predicted: Eisenhower's \\"reputation is likely to continue to rise, perhaps to the point that he will be ranked just below Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt.\\"  I am skeptical that history ever will be that kind to Eisenhower.  Ambrose writes that, by November 1952, Eisenhower had come to actively dislike Harry Truman\\" because \\"in Eisenhower's view Truman had diminished the prestige of the office of the President of the United States.\\"  Even Eisenhower's critics, and there remain plenty of them, must concede, based upon the record presented by authors such as Ambrose, that he conducted the duties of the presidency with great dignity.   And that places him far above some of his successors.  The two-volume Ambrose biography of Eisenhower is now out of print, having been superceded by this author's Eisenhower: Soldier and President and more recent works of scholarship.  But Eisenhower, Volume Two, The President, continues to have value as a highly-detailed account of the administration of a president who may, indeed, have been under-appreciated.  Ambrose is partial to his subject, but he generally allows Eisenhower's actions to speak for themselves, and I do not believe that a reader may ask much more from a biographer.	2001-04-14
US	50862643	R1U5Q4U27RB1LX	0060164549	304333481	The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963	Books	4	18	19	N	N	Comprehensive Study of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Relationship	This is a massive (700 page), comprehensive, if not especially analytic, study of the United States' relationship with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, told from the perspectives of the superpowers' leaders, John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev.  At the beginning of his administration, Kennedy may have had sincere desire to improve relations with the Soviets, but his famous inaugural address was interpreted by many as a committed cold warrior's call to arms, and, as Beschloss's title implies, a series of foreign policy crises followed.  Often in minute detail, Beschloss discusses the disastrous invasion of Cuba by opponents of Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs, the construction of the Berlin Wall, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the Cuban missile crisis.  For those who enjoy narrative history liberally sprinkled with portraits of colorful personalities, this is a fascinating book.<br />There is little in this book which is new, but much of it bears repeating, especially for readers too young to remember the early 1960s.  However odious Castro's dictatorship was to become, the attempt to topple it in the spring of 1961 was destined to fail.  According to Beschloss, one of Kennedy's advisers warned him that \\"he could not recall a single case in history when refugees returned and successfully overthrew a revolutionary regime.\\"  The Berlin crisis that summer did not escalate into a nuclear confrontation because, as Kennedy observed: \\"A wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.\\"  And Beschloss writes about the missile crisis that the 39 hours' warning of the naval quarantine that Kennedy gave Khrushchev \\"demonstrated the President's wisdom in starting his response not with an irreversible air strike but with milder pressures that gave Khrushchev time to ponder his move.\\"<br />Some of Beschloss's observations about the leaders border on gossip.  He lends credence to reports that Khrushchev could be a buffoon who occasionally drank too much and that Kennedy's enthusiastic womanizing continued while he was president.  But personal traits and predilections often could not be separated from matters of substance.  For instance, the author reports that Kennedy was regularly treated by a medical practitioner with \\"vitamin shots\\" which \\"also contained amphetamines, steroids, hormones, and animal organ cells.\\"  Beschloss proceeds to explain the importance of this revelation: \\"Even in small doses, amphetamines cause side effects such as nervousness, garrulousness, impaired judgment, overconfidence, and, when the drug wears off, depression.\\"  Beschloss implies that Kennedy may have been under the influence of amphetamines at his summit meeting with Khrushchev in the spring of 1961, when the Soviet leader, by Kennedy's own admission, \\"just beat hell out of me.\\"  Beschloss concludes that Kennedy \\"should have been vastly more careful in pursuing his medical experimentation than he had been as a Senator.  The stakes now were not one political career but literally the fate of the world.\\"<br />This book is not without its limitations.  As I implied above, it is much stronger on narrative than analysis, and some passages give the impression that Beschloss was more interested in the personalities of Kennedy and Khrushchev than in the substance of the policies they devised and pursued.  Beschloss's discussion of Kennedy's approach to the growing conflict in Vietnam is brief and generally superficial.  The book's organization is quirky: The role of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in the development of Kennedy's national-security policy is barely mentioned until page 400.  And the index is not entirely reliable.  (For instance, the index's listing for Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, inexplicably omits reference to Beschloss's description of a critical briefing Lemnitzer gave to the President in September 1961 in which the \\"bottom line\\" was that \\"the United States enjoyed vast nuclear superiority.\\")<br />While I was preparing this review, I discovered that this book, which was published in 1991, is already out of print, and that surprised me a bit.  Some aspects of it clearly have been superceded by more recent scholarship, such as Lawrence Freedman's Kennedy's Wars: Berlin, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam, which I reviewed here shortly after it was published last November, but I believe that Beschloss's book continues to be of value.  The magnificent 19th-century English historian Thomas Carlyle once wrote: \\"The history of the world is but the biography of great men.\\"  Few eras provide more validation for Carlyle's perspective than the crisis years of 1961 and 1962, dominated as they were by the intensely personal diplomacy of Kennedy and Khrushchev.  Beschloss's coverage of that aspect of U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations during this period is superb.st nuclear superiority.\\")    <br />While I was preparing this review, I discovered that this book, which was published in 1991, is already out of print, and that surprised me a bit.

US	50862643	R2JA4BXRDP3SD7	0156788705	751192241	Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940	Books	5	110	114	N	N	A Great Political Biography of a Great President	I recently had occasion to re-read James MacGregor Burns's marvelous Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox and was deeply impressed by how well its has withstood the test of time.  The early paperback edition of this book, which was originally published in 1956 and covers the period from 1882 until 1940, characterized it as the \\"first political biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\\" and it continues to be the authoritative study of Roosevelt's preparation for and then conduct of his first two terms as president, when domestic affairs demanded most of his attention.  This remains a wonderful book about this country's greatest politician of the 20th century, and it also offers many penetrating insights into the American political system.      <br />Burns's treatment of Roosevelt is comprehensive, \\"[treating] much of [Roosevelt's] personal as well as his public life, because a great politician's career remorselessly sucks everything into its vortex.\\"  Roosevelt was the only child of a member of the upstate New York landed gentry, and he could have led a life of leisure.  Instead, he was sent to Groton School in Massachusetts, where the headmaster, according to Burns, \\"made much of his eagerness to educate his boys for political leadership.\\"  Roosevelt completed his formal education at Harvard College and Columbia University Law School.  Burns writes that Roosevelt's first elective office, as a New York State Senator was a \\"political education,\\" and he became a \\"Young Lion\\" in Albany.  Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in Washington, D.C., during World War I and was the candidate for Vice President on the Democrat Party's unsuccessful ticket in 1920.  In 1921, Roosevelt was stricken with polio, and the crippling disease would have ended the public career of a less ambitious and determined man.  Instead, he continued to work hard at politics, was elected Governor of New York in 1928 and then President in 1932.  This was just the beginning of a remarkable career in high office.<br />Burns makes clear that Roosevelt was a progressive in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson but was without strong ideas or a specific agenda.  According to Burns: \\"The presidency, Roosevelt said shortly after his election, `is preeminently a place of moral leadership.'\\"  Retired Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes offered this cutting assessment: \\"A second -class intellect, but a first-class temperament.\\"  Action to combat the depression was necessary to restore public confidence in government, and the first Hundred Days of Roosevelt's first term was one of the great periods of legislative achievement in American history.  Burns writes: \\"Roosevelt was following no master program.\\"   However, in Burns's view: \\"The classic test of greatness in the White House has been the chief executive's capacity to lead Congress.\\"  According to that test, Roosevelt was a great president.  Burns writes that, \\"[i]n his first two years in office Roosevelt achieved to a remarkable degree the exalted position of being President of all the people.\\"  Burns explains: \\"A remarkable aspect of the New Deal was the sweep and variety of the groups it helped.\\"  <br />As early as 1934, however, organized conservative opposition to the New Deal was forming.  (A newspaper cartoon reprinted here shows a figure identified as the Republican Party holding a sign stating: \\"Roosevelt is a Red!\\")  Roosevelt was increasingly attacked as a traitor to his class, but a large measure of his genius was his ability to hold the more extreme elements of the New Deal in check.  Roosevelt's political skills were tested in every way.  For instance, Burns writes that Senator Robert Wagner's National Labor Relations Act, which proposed to\\"[vest] massive economic and political power in organized labor\\" \\"was the most radical legislation passed during the New Deal.\\"  According to Burns, Roosevelt's initial reaction to the bill was \\"invariably cool or evasive,\\" and the president, with what Burns describes as \\"typical Rooseveltian agility,\\" announced his support for the bill only after its passage was certain.  Burns demonstrates that Roosevelt's support, both in Congress and among the public, gradually eroded in the late 1930s, but he was, of course, elected again in 1940 and 1944.  Roosevelt's nomination in 1940 was especially skillful.  Many in his own party favored maintaining the tradition of limiting presidents to two terms, and Democratic Party leaders lined up in the hope of succeeding Roosevelt.  Roosevelt outfoxed all of them and was elected to his historic third term.  <br />I believe it is fair to say that Burns admires Roosevelt, but this book is not a whitewash.  Burns candidly writes about Roosevelt's \\"deviousness.\\"  And the author is appropriately critical of Roosevelt's attempt to \\"pack\\" the Supreme Court following his overwhelming re-election in 1936.  However, in my opinion, these instances simply are proof of the truism that great men are not always good men.  Burns took the subtitle of this book from the Italian Renaissance political philosopher Machiavelli's dictum that a political leader must be strong like a lion and shrewd like a fox.  Franklin D. Roosevelt was both, and that made him a great president.  This is a great political biography of that great president	2001-04-04

Samuel Eliot Morison's superb biography of John Paul Jones supports, if not proves, that proposition.  Jones's greatness is undeniable: Although he was the son of an obscure Scottish gardener, he virtually founded the United States Navy, he won one of the most important sea battles of the Revolutionary War when he was only 32, and he later commanded ships in the service of France and Russia.  But Jones also was extremely temperamental, excessively vain (after receiving an honor from France, he liked to be addressed as \\"Chevalier Paul Jones\\"), and he had mistresses in practically every port.   Morison, a longtime professor at Harvard and the author of the authoritative, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Christopher Columbus, as well as a massive, multi-volume history of the U.S. Navy during World War II, reports all of this in a matter-of-fact fashion.  Morison's Jones is a great sailor and a man of the world in every respect.<br />According to Morison, Young Jones was highly ambitious and went to sea at age 13 \\"as a road to distinction.\\"  During the next 15 years, he learned well his trade and he also became an American patriot.  At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Morison writes that the American navy was \\"only a haphazard collection of converted merchant ships,\\" and the Royal Navy was probably the most powerful in history.  But General George Washington, according to Morison, \\"had a keen appreciation of the value and capabilities of sea power,\\" and, in October 1775, Congress appointed a Naval Committee of Seven to manage the colonies' maritime affairs.  In December 1775, seven months before the American colonies declared their independence from Great Britain, Jones accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the continental navy. <br />Although Morison is primarily interested in Jones's activities during the Revolutionary War, he makes a number of more generally cogent observations.  For instance, the UnitedStates government was in a state of nearly constant impecuniousness and was able to afford to build only one of the largest class of naval vessels, a ship of the line, during the conflict.  In Morison's view, this was the status of the war at the time of the battle off Flamborough Head in September 1779, which secured Jones's fame: \\"The War of Independence had reached a strategic deadlock, a situation that recurred in both World Wars of the twentieth century.  Each party, unable to reach a decision by fleet action or pitched land battles, resorts to raids and haphazard, desultory operations which have no military effect.\\"  That deadlock continued, according to Morison, until 1781.   Morison also writes that Britain took the position \\"since the United States were not a recognized government but a group of rebellious provinces,...American armed ships were no better than pirates.\\"              <br />Morison appears to be deeply impressed by Jones's technical competence: \\"One of Paul Jones's praiseworthy traits was his constant desire to improve his professional knowledge.\\"  That passion for self-improvement reached fruition September 1779 off the Yorkshire coast of east-central England when a squadron which Jones commanded from the Bonhomme Richard defeated the H.M.S. Serapis in a three and one-half hour battle during which those ships were locked in what Morison describes as a \\"deadly embrace.\\"  (Bonhomme Richard sank during the aftermath of the fierce fighting.)  It was during this battle that Jones defiantly refused to surrender with the immortal phrase: \\"I have not yet begun to fight.\\"  According to Morison, \\"[c]asualties were heavy for an eighteenth-century naval battle.  Jones estimated his loss at 150 killed and wounded out of a total of 322.\\"  Morison writes that Jones was at his \\"pinnacle of fame\\" in late 1779, and, when he visited France, which was allied with the U.S. during the Revolutionary War, in April 1780: He became the lion of Paris, honored by everyone from the King down.\\"   When Jones returned to the United States in 1781, however, he was unable to obtain what Morison describes as a \\"suitable command,\\" and he never fought again under the American flag.   In 1788 and 1789, as \\"Kontradmiral Pavel Ivanovich Jones\\" he swerved in the navy of Catherine II, \\"the Great,\\" Empress of Russia.  When he died in 1792, he was buried in France, but, in 1905, his body was returned to the United States and now rests in the chapel of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.<br />Jones's nasty temper is frequently on display.  Morison remarks on various occasions that his crews were \\"disobedient,\\" \\"sullen,\\" and \\"surly.\\"  Which was cause and which was effect is difficult to ascertain.   Jones clearly was an overbearing commander, which may explain, though does not excuse, his crews' bad attitudes.  On one occasion Jones had one of his officers \\"placed under arrest for insubordination [giving the officer] a chance to clear it up, and Jones was unwilling to admit his error.\\"  It is not prudent to compare events during war in the late 18th century to the peace and prosperity of our own time, but no reader of this book will be impressed by Jones's interpersonal skills.   <br />Morison makes numerous references to \\"prize money,\\" the curious, but apparently then-universal, practice of rewarding captains and their crews in cash for capturing enemy ships.  The fact that Jones pursued prize money with vigor may raise additional doubts about his character, but I would guess Morison believed that Jones simply followed a custom which probably motivated many successful naval captains of his time.<br />Morison held the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy during World War II.  Although the degree of detail in his narrative is fascinating, I found some passages too technical, and I suspect some other lay readers may be baffled as well.  (The book's charts and diagrams were, however, very helpful.)  But that is a small price to pay for a wonderfulbiography of one of the most intriguing figures of the American Revolution.	2001-03-29

He served as a tank commander under General George Patton at the Battle of the Bulge, in occupied Germany and wartime Korea, as commander of United States military forces in Vietnam, and as Army Chief of Staff.  It was a remarkable career!  Lewis Sorley's admiring biography of General Abrams narrates the principal events in appropriate detail.  In the prologue, Sorley asserts that Abrams was \\"the quintessential soldier,\\" explaining that Abrams \\"demonstrated strategic and tactical skill and audacity,\\" extraordinary physical bravery and intellectual courage, the capacity to lead and inspire men, [and] talent in dealing with complex and ambiguous managerial challenges.\\"  The measure of the value of this book lies in whether Sorley effectively makes that case.  I believe that he largely does, as the result of which this is a very good, if not great, professional biography.<br />Although Sorley's approach to biography is conventional, he demonstrates on several occasions that Abrams's views could be very unconventional.  Early in his chapter about West Point in the mid-1930s, for instance. Sorley asserts: \\"From the beginning Abrams was alienated by some aspects of the cadet experience.\\"  According to Sorley, Abrams was highly self-motivated and self-disciplined, and he resisted the petty tyranny of cadet life.  After Abrams graduated and was commissioned, Sorley writes that he \\"was tolerant of his soldiers' having fun.\\"  (Sorley quotes one Abrams subordinate that the general, if Abrams had a weakness, \\"he sometimes was too easy on some people.\\")  After World War II, while Abrams was serving in the Plans Section for Army Ground Forces in Washington, D.C., he was assigned to prepare a study on the future of the horse cavalry and quickly concluded that there was none.  In 1965, shortly after President Johnson ordered American forces in Vietnam out of their advisory role andinto combat, Abrams was briefing a civilian official about the sociological impact of the draft and stated that \\"the only Americans who have the honor to die for their country in Vietnam are the dumb, the poor, and the black.\\"  According to Sorley, \\"[o]ut in the field Abrams disliked briefings, especially of the canned and rehearsed variety,\\" and \\"[o]ne of [Abrams's] favorite ways [to find out for himself the truth of what was going on] was through small groups of young officers he would have in for dinner.\\"  And when Abrams left Vietnam, Sorley writes that \\"he went as he had come - no bands, no ceremonies, no flags, no fuss.\\"   Similarly, when he arrived back in Washington, according to Sorley, he got rid of the Chief of Staff's \\"\\"big black Cadillac limousine...using instead a small Chevelle from Pentagon motor pool that was painted robin's egg blue.  No amenities, not even a star plate.\\"    <br />Sorley occasionally offers significant insight.  For instance, Sorley writes that Johnson's decision not to call up the reserves at the beginning of the expansion of the war in Vietnam was \\"perhaps the most fateful decision of the entire conflict.\\"  (Abrams explained the impact of this decision: \\"We decide[d] to use the Army in Vietnam, minus the National Guard and the Army Reserve.\\")   In addition, according to Sorley: \\"A pervasive atmosphere of mistrust and antagonism characterized civil-military relationships in the Pentagon of the 1960s.\\"  Sorley describes the battle of Tet in 1968 as a \\"true watershed,\\" which is not penetrating analysis, but he proceeds to explain: \\"Before Tet, America was seeking a military victory in Vietnam, but after it she was seeking to get out.\\"  About Abrams's appointment to the position of Army Chief of Staff, Sorley writes: \\"Creighton Abrams returned from Vietnam to head an Army that was widely viewed, both by the nation and from within its own ranks, as dispirited and desperately in need of reform.  His appointment was the first step in getting on with the job of rebuilding.\\" <br />In other places, Sorley's approach to his subject approaches hagiography.  For instance, although Abrams' performance during the relief of Bastogne was heroic, Sorley's assertion that this made Abrams \\"the most famous small unit leader of the war\\" is debatable.  And Sorley's assertion that \\"Abrams command in Vietnam was...arguably the most difficult any top American soldier in the field has ever had to face\\" seems extreme.  But Sorley may well be correct in writing: \\"In terms of prior experience Abrams was probably the best-qualified man ever to assume the duties of Army Chief of Staff.\\"<br />This biography concludes with Abrams's death.  I would have much preferred for Sorley to devote a few pages to placing Abrams's accomplishments in the context of American military history from World War II through the middle of the Cold War.  But Abrams had an extraordinary career, and this is a very good narrative of it.	2001-03-27

(The image of \\"bohemia\\" as the antithesis to middle-class values owes much to Puccini's opera \\"La Bohème,\\" which was first produced in 1896.)  According to Stansell, bohemian New York \\"was one manifestation of gathering revulsion against a society that seemed locked in a stranglehold of bourgeois resolve.\\"   That is an intriguing thesis, and Stansell provides wonderfully-evocative profiles of many of the New York pioneers of American modernism.  Anyone interested in the origins and development of 20th-century American culture should read this extraordinary book.    <br />Stansell succinctly defines bohemia as the \\"revolt against bourgeois convention,\\" and she writes that New York's bohemia was widely believed to be peopled with \\"youthful libertines who despised bourgeois respectability and material success.\\"  One respect in which bohemia rejected middle-class certainties was to permit innovation in gender relations, and the appearance of the \\"New Women\\" in New York beginning in the 1890 is among the most important events Stansell describes.    <br />What Stansell characterizes as the \\"dissent from bourgeois  life\\" took many forms, and it is difficult to generalize without oversimplifying, but her chapter on political radical Emma Goldman begins with the important point that modernism tended to merge \\"disparate  phenomena.\\"  According to Stansell, Goldman \\"championed modern dance and modern drama, free love, homosexuality, and martyrs of the labor movement,\\" and she was a forceful advocate of \\"militant anticapitalism.\\"  I would recommend this book solely for Stansell's multi-part sketch of Goldman.<br />Stansell's discussion of changes in the publishing industry also is excellent.  According to Stansell established publishes were increasingly criticized as \\"aging, smug, priggish, stodgy,\\" attributes which probably could have been assigned to middle-class leaders of all facets of turn-of-the-century American society.  In contrast, Stansell writes, independent publishers, \\"mostly well-off German Jews,\\" marketed literature with a political nature, as well as \\"birth control information, pornography, and papers advocating free love.\\"  Stansell incisively observes that the frequent battles of this era concerning censorship laws were part of a broader \\"contest for cultural authority..., a battle over who was to determine the content of literature,\\" and censorship opponents \\"were delighted to find themselves free-speech heroes.\\"<br />Stansell's discussion of the political and cultural content of the revolt against middle-class America demonstrates the complex interplay of ideas, as does the section of her book entitled \\"The Human Sex.\\"  According to Stansell, the moderns rejected the \\"crippling convention of their parents' generation [that] had set the sexes against each other by segregating people into separate spheres.\\"  It probably is not surprising that, in addition to advocating sexual democracy, radicals of this era often supported women's suffrage.  Furthermore, Stansell writes, \\"controversy over contraception  often \\"turned into a free speech issue.\\"  Stansell's bohemians had liberated attitudes toward sexual activity, and she notes that \\"free love\\" also signified talking and writing about [sex], a lively discourse of sexual conversation and revelation.\\"             <br />I suspect that Stansell goes to far when she asserts that there was a \\"crisis of the bourgeoisie\\" beginning in the 1890s.  Indeed, I would argue that there have been few periods in American history when middle-class values were more dominant.  But Stansell is absolutely correct that the New York bohemians' resistance to bourgeois hegemony challenged numerous conventions of American society and culture, and many members of theAmerican middle-class considered themselves to be under assault.    <br />Most of the books I read concern military or political history, but Christine Stansell's American Moderns was fascinating, and I recommend it without qualification.	2001-03-26
US	50862643	R3F17PTCFD3AFE	0452272068	69768333	Stonewall	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Personality in the Gay Liberation Movement's Early Years	The \\"Stonewall\\" in the title of this intriguing, if narrow, study by Martin Duberman was a mobster-controlled New York City bar which was the scene of a series of \\"riots\\" in the summer of 1969, now regarded as an important milestone in the movement for gay and lesbian rights.  Duberman, who teaches at the City University of New York, has written extensively in the field of gay and lesbian studies, and this is one of his best-known books.  This is more a work of anthropology than a comprehensive history of the origins of the gay liberation movement because it is built around a series of sketches of gay and lesbian life in New York in the 1960s.  Duberman focuses on the lives of six gay and lesbian activists, and his research is prodigious, but, whether the lives he selected were representative of the times is subject to debate.  In the preface, Duberman acknowledges the book's \\"emphasis on personality,\\" and the story it tells also includes an interesting mix of petty mobsters and corrupt cops, as well as walk-on appearances by the famous and later-to-be famous, including future San Francisco Mayor Harvey Milk, Yippie leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, civil rights pioneer Bayard Rustin, author Rita Mae Brown, and Jim Morrison, The Doors' front-man.  But there is more to writing history than profiling the leaders even of great social movements.<br />Duberman is well aware of the important context surrounding the events about which he writes.  According to the author: \\"'Stonewall' is the emblematic event in modern lesbian and gay history\\" because the series of riots \\"has become synonymous over the years with gay resistance to oppression.\\"  He asserts that his focus on individuals \\"will increase the ability of readers to identify...with experiences different from, but comparable to, their own.\\"  Although this is not, strictly speaking, a conventional work of academic history, Duberman makes some important, incisive observations.  For instance, he briefly discusses what he refers to as \\"the endemic homophobia that characterized the black political movement\\" of the 1960s.  (According to Duberman, Bayard Rustin, the principal organizer of the March on Washington in 1963, was ostracized after Rustin's sexual orientation was revealed.)  In Duberman's view, the \\"new frankness about homosexuality\\" of the mid-1960s, \\"was part and parcel of a much larger cultural upheaval,\\" and \\"the homophile movement\\" reflected and contributed to \\"the general assault on cultural values.\\"  And, according to Duberman, the direct-action tactics adopted by groups such as the East Coast Homophile Organizations were \\"inspired\\" by the efforts of militant students on college campuses and Freedom Riders in the south to achieve social justice in a different arena.     <br />Focused as it is on the personalities of six activists, this book is, in some respects, less than the sum of its parts.  I found it fascinating reading, but it is far from the whole story of the early years of the gay liberation movement.  There can be little doubt about the importance of individual leaders in the emergence of gay and lesbian activism in the 1960s.  However, there is much more to the history of gay resistance to oppression than the extent to which it affords readers the opportunity to identify with experiences different from, but comparable to, their own.	2001-03-25
US	50862643	R1XNRM3JCBHAYJ	0684834804	742968691	Robert Kennedy : His Life	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Do We Really Know Robert Kennedy?	Author Evan Thomas, Assistant Managing Editor of Newsweek, has written several works of popular biography, and I especially enjoyed his The Very Best Men: Four Who Dared: The Early Years of the CIA.  Thomas's book about Robert Kennedy, the least-understood Kennedy brother, is characteristically well written, and Thomas covers the major events of  his life in less than 400 pages, so the author's economy of style must be applauded.  But Thomas presents little which is new, and, in that respect, this book is slightly disappointing.   Admirers of Robert Kennedy probably will continue to believe that his assassination in June 1968, when he was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president, left much undone, but I do not believe Thomas offers us much reason to believe we really understand RFK.  <br />     RFK was well educated at Portsmouth Priory, Harvard College, and the University of Virginia law school, but Thomas suggests that other events in his formative years and early adulthood were more influential.  Kennedy just missed serving in World War II, in which his oldest brother Joseph was killed in combat and from which JFK returned a hero.  According to Thomas: \\"Perhaps in part because he had never seen the real thing, Kennedy glorified war.\\"  In 1953, RFK briefly served as a lawyer on the staff of Senator Joseph McCarthy's permanent subcommittee on investigations.  Thomas offers no reason to believe that Kennedy was offended by the substance of the work; his early departure was, instead, the result of a personality conflict with the notorious Roy Cohn.   RFK eventually made a name for himself investigating corruption in the labor movement and the influence of organized crime on unions, and he later believed that the Mafia don of New Orleans played a role in the assassination of his brother.   <br />     After John Kennedy's election in 1960, according to Thomas, Joseph P. Kennedy insisted that Robert be appointed Attorney General to position him to serve as the President's \\"all-purpose consigliere.\\"  Some of RFK's assignments in that role were ugly, and Thomas suggests that the psychological effects were deep.  It is now well known that Kennedy pressured the C.I.A. to \\"get rid\\" of Fidel Castro, and RFK also gave the F.B.I. authority to wiretap the telephones of the Rev. Martin Luther King, caving in to pressure from Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was almost pathologically obsessed with attempting to discredit the civil rights leader.  If there is little in this book which is new, there is plenty to reinforce Robert Kennedy's reputation for ruthlessness. <br />     The vicious Lyndon Johnson-Robert Kennedy rivalry, which pervaded their formal relationship from President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 through the time of RFK's death, also attracts a good deal of Thomas's attention.  Their now well-documented hatred for each other was profound in its ugliness, and this made it exceptionally difficult for holdovers from the Kennedy administration to serve effectively under Johnson.  <br />     Some of the most telling passages concern Robert Kennedy's limitations as a practical politician.  During his 1964 campaign for election to the Senate from New York, according to Thomas, Kennedy proved that he \\"was not a natural on the stump,\\" and, although RFK defeated a Republican incumbent, he ran 2,000,000 votes behind President Johnson's awesome margin of victory in that state.  Once in office, Kennedy refused to exert himself with respect to the Senate's elaborate system of customs and rituals, and, according to Thomas, \\"in his three and one half years in the U.S. Senate, he lacked the seniority to pass any major piece of legislation.\\"<br />     Anyone who reads Evan Thomas's biography of Robert Kennedy will learn a lot about one of the most important figures in American politics in the 1960s, but I suspect that some readers will be left with the sense that they still do not really know the man.	2001-03-24

Author John Lewis Gaddis taught for many years at Ohio University and is now on the faculty at Yale.  He is a long-time, thoughtful analyst of the great confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union which dominated world events for nearly five decades World War II.  Since the end of the Cold War, Gaddis has had the opportunity to survey the English-language literature, as well as documents which, by the mid-1990s, were beginning to &quot;trickle&quot; out of the &quot;other side&quot; of the Cold War, to determine which aspects of the history of the Cold War, if any, require reassessment.  Although this book primarily discusses the &quot;high Cold War,&quot; the period from the end of World War II through the Cuban missile crisis, it is an important contribution to the literature.<br />Gaddis begins with Alexis de Tocqueville's intriguing observation, made in 1835, that &quot;[t]here are now two great nations in the world...the Russians and the Anglo-Americans.&quot;  Gaddis observes that there were several historical sources of &quot;Russian-American antagonism&quot; which predated the &quot;power vacuum&quot; that separated the United States and the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War.  More important were the attitudes of the countries in 1945: the U.S. was determined, according to Gaddis, to &quot;seek power in the postwar world&quot;  Stalin, the &quot;Soviet leader, too sought security,&quot; but Gaddis asserts that, to Stalin, &quot;[n]ational security had come to mean personal security.&quot;  The role of Stalin in the Cold War's origins is central to Gaddis's thesis.  <br />According to Gaddis, &quot;the nature of the post-World War II international system&quot; was characteristic of empire.  In Gaddis's view, Stalin fused &quot;Marxist internationalism with tsarist imperialism&quot; and this prompted the Soviet Union's territorial acquisitions and establishment of spheres of influence.&quot;  For the United States, according to Gaddis, &quot;Pearl Harbor was...the defining event for the American empire,&quot; and its post-war goals were to maintain &quot;a substantial peacetime military establishment and a string of bases around the world from which to resist aggression if it should ever occur.&quot;  Gaddis writes: &quot;One empire arose...by invitation; the other by imposition.&quot;  According to Gaddis, &quot;the Cold War through the end of 1948 remained primarily a European conflict,&quot; as a result of which &quot;the Cold War's sudden expansion into Asia in 1949-50 caught everyone by surprise.&quot;  According to Gaddis, &quot;Korea turned out to be the most bitterly contested of all Cold War battlegrounds.&quot;  Gaddis observes that the origins of the conflict remain complicated and controversial, but, writing about Stalin, Gaddis asserts that &quot;the normally cautious Soviet leader&quot; authorized the attack on South Korea as a result of &quot;Stalin's new optimism about the prospects for international revolution.&quot;  Nevertheless, according to Gaddis, when Stalin and Mao Zedong met to discuss the prospects for war in Korea, &quot;Stalin warned the Koreans &quot;not to `expect great assistance and support from the Soviet Union, because it had more important challenges to meet than the Korean problem.'&quot;  Gaddis remarks: &quot;Stalin...was determined to have the Chinese confront the Americans but at the same time so determined not to have the Soviet Union do so that he would have sacrificed North Korea altogether had Mao refused to intervene.&quot;   <br />Gaddis writes: &quot;By the time Truman left office and Stalin died, early in 1953, the basic patterns of the Cold War were firmly established.  Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union would accept the other's vision of the postwar world....Cold War  history is, at least in part, the story of how what was thought to be unendurable became endurable; how order and stability, if rarely justice, evolved from bitterand sustained rivalry.&quot;  Gaddis asserts that the &quot;German question...did more than anything else to delay&quot; the Cold War's settlement.  By the middle 1950s, Gaddis suggests, the &quot;continued division of Germany was...a convenient, perhaps even a comfortable option for the Americans, the Russians, and their respective allies.&quot;  While the Cold War settled into a comfort level in Germany, it threatened to ignite  nuclear war in Cuba.  Gaddis asserts that, after Khrushchev came to power, he &quot;hoped to improve relations with the United States,&quot; and &quot;Castro's insurgency had attracted little attention and no support from Moscow.&quot;  But Khrushchev seized the opportunity and by July 1960, according to Gaddis, the Soviet leader &quot;was openly threatening to the United States with a Soviet missile attack if it should try to invade Cuba.&quot;  That was mere bluster, but the missile crisis in October 1962 brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any time since the Korean War.  Gaddis asks: &quot;What is there new to say about the Cuban missile crisis?&quot;  Despite numerous &quot;revisions and reconsiderations,&quot; Gaddis asserts that &quot;the central place the Cuban missile crisis occupies in Cold War history&quot; has not changed.  The missiles were removed in what is generally regarded as a &quot;great victory&quot; for the United States, but Khrushchev later insisted that the crisis was a triumph for the Soviet Union because it was &quot;able to extract from Kennedy a promise that neither America nor any of her allies would invade Cuba.&quot;<br />In his concluding chapter on &quot;New Cold War History,&quot;Gaddis acknowledges that he is offering &quot;first impressions,&quot; which he states as hypotheses.  Perhaps the most interesting is Gaddis view that &quot;the United States and the Soviet Union built empires after World War II, although not of the same kind.&quot;  With respect to responsibility for the Cold War, Gaddis writes that &quot;the `new' history brings us back to an old answer: that &quot;as long as Stalin was running the Soviet Union a cold war was unavoidable.&quot;  That accounts for the Cold War's origins, but it does not explain why it continued for over 35 years after Stalin died.  As Gaddis observes: &quot;Tocqueville had predicted bipolarity but not necessarily hostility.&quot;  What was the principal cause of the bitter hostility essential to the Cold War?  Until that is understood, there will be plenty of work for Gaddis and other practitioners of the &quot;new&quot; history of the Cold War.	2000-12-28
US	50862643	R27YNKYKZV8ORO	0252064453	833405673	Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream	Books	5	31	32	N	N	A Lincoln Everyone Needs to Know	The &quot;prime goal&quot; of this marvelous book by Gabor Boritt, Professor of Civil War Studies and director of the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College, &quot;is the examination of [Lincoln's] economic persuasion, of how it broadly manifested itself in his political life, and how it affected American history.&quot;  For many readers, a book about Lincoln's &quot;economic persuasion&quot; may seem pedantic, if not trivial, but Boritt demonstrates that Lincoln's economic views were central to his political philosophy.  Had Lincoln not been an economic nationalist, he almost certainly never would have risen beyond being an unknown, provincial Illinois politician.<br />As Boritt explains in the preface, Lincoln's &quot;connections with political economy&quot; &quot;may appear to be dreadfully dull to some,&quot; but the author cautions that &quot;it is indispensable.&quot;  Lincoln first came to prominence in rural Illinois in the 1830s as an advocate for &quot;better transportation - `internal improvements,' as Americans called it.&quot;  As a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, Lincoln &quot;supported the creation of many, though not all, private, river, canal, turnpike, and railroad companies.&quot;  At the end of the first chapter, Boritt writes that Lincoln's &quot;political activity was inspired, beyond the hope of personal or party gain, by a vision of endless material progress,&quot; which became the &quot;American dream.&quot;<br />Because Lincoln's origins were humble, he often is portrayed as a champion of the common man, but, as Boritt observes, for Lincoln, &quot;banking was a special interest,&quot; and, in 1835, he supported a state bank because, according to Boritt, &quot;the Illinois economy needed banking facilities above all to support internal improvements.&quot;  By 1837, Lincoln was a member of the [Illinois] House Finance Committee, and, according to Boritt, he &quot;made economics the most substantial part of his campaigning,legislative labors, and private studies outside (and not infrequently inside) his legal work.&quot;  In an 1837 speech defending the state bank, Boritt writes that Lincoln &quot;was giving voice to the prime element of his developing economic persuasion.   The fact was that for the man who would rise, for the nations that would rise, banks were necessary.&quot;  Boritt's assessment is: &quot;Lincoln's involvement with improvements helped him reach  convictions which played a crucial role during his presidency.&quot;  According to Boritt, &quot;the improvement episode helped make Lincoln a lifelong opponent of the localism and sectionalism that proved so destructive in Illinois.&quot;  <br />In the mid-1840s, when Lincoln was hoping to be elected to Congress, his &quot;Whiggery was mainly economic oriented,&quot; and his acceptance of broad party principles &quot;meant national economic goals.&quot;  According to Boritt: &quot;Lincoln's thinking...exuded nationalism.&quot;  In Washington, he &quot;desired large scale federal improvements, federally directed, at federal expense.&quot;  &quot;But in Congress Lincoln began to shift his attention from specific questions of economics&quot; as a result of the Mexican War, which Lincoln opposed.  In Boritt's view: &quot;Lincoln's lack of enthusiasm about expansion may have been shortsighted in economic terms,&quot; but, according to Boritt, Lincoln appears to have believed that &quot;[e]conomic development demanded peace.&quot;   <br />In the 1850s, according to Boritt, as Lincoln was &quot;pulled...toward Republicanism,&quot; he continued to believe &quot;the economics of prosperity, freedom, and this democracy.&quot;  In several places, Boritt observes that Lincoln believed in the inevitability of material progress.  In contrast: &quot;Slavery was a relic of barbarism.&quot;  In 1856, according to Boritt, Lincoln noted that the &quot;`central idea' of America was equality.&quot;  To Lincoln, in Boritt's view, &quot;equality&quot; meant &quot;opportunity to get ahead in life.&quot;  Boritt explains: &quot;Since the central idea of America was economic, the measure of the nation's success had to be economic, too.&quot;  In this respect, according to Boritt, Lincoln &quot;institutionalized the American Dream - made it perhaps the most central idea of the nation,&quot; and slavery had to be extinguished because it &quot;subverted the Dream.&quot;  According to Boritt: &quot;Lincoln could perceive America only through nationalist eyes....As Lincoln saw it, the nation was to become either free or slave, one or the other.&quot;  <br />During the 1850s, according to Boritt, Lincoln became increasingly absorbed with the slavery issue.  Once elected president, according to Boritt, &quot;Lincoln's eyes remained set on one foremost goal: stopping slavery extension in the name of the American Dream.&quot;  According to Boritt: &quot;Lincoln defended the Union on many occasions and in almost as many ways, but by far his most extensive and determined defense was a largely economic defense.&quot;   In his annual message in 1862, according to Boritt, Lincoln declared that the &quot;United States could not be broken up...because it formed am indivisible economic unit.&quot;  In Boritt's view, &quot;Lincoln's first important military act was essentially economic: the proclamation of a blockade of Southern ports....The adaption of economic policy to military strategy, thus began a few days after the fall of Fort Sumter, continued to Appomattox.&quot;  According to Boritt: &quot;Emancipation by itself ran counter to the President's policy of enticing Southerners back into the Union through economic means.&quot;   Boritt writes: &quot;Lincoln appreciated the need for an economic base for the former slaves.&quot;  The employment of former slaves liberated by the circumstances of war, Boritt explains, &quot;transformed the slave into a wage-earning free laborer.&quot;  Nevertheless, in Boritt's view, Lincoln &quot;failed to come to grips fully with the needs of the masses of blacks.&quot;  In the final chapter, Boritt writes: &quot;For Lincoln, unobstructed upward mobility was the most important ideal America strove for....Mobility was the ideal and slavery its antipode.&quot;  For Lincoln, in Boritt's view, &quot;the most `central idea' of the Union war effort was the preservation of man's right to rise.'&quot; <br />What, ultimately, is the connection between Lincoln's economic and political philosophy?  I believe Boritt would say that Lincoln's economic nationalism made him a lifelong opponent of the localism and sectionalism, as well as a strong believer in economic opportunity.  In one of this book's key passages, Boritt writes that &quot;slavery was the supreme issue for [Lincoln] because he feared its extension would strangle the American Dream.&quot;  After reading this book, no reader will doubt that, throughout his public career, Lincoln was a man ahead of his time.	2000-12-26
US	50862643	R1DAHLZS8QZZQD	0822313863	549126668	In the Name of National Security: Hitchcock, Homophobia, and the Political Construction of Gender in Postwar America (New Americanists)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Early-Cold War Attitudes about National Security and Gender	Author Robert Corber's assertion that homosexual men and lesbians were intentionally excluded from the early-Cold War consensus is not surprising because, in the late 1940s and through the 1950s, the message to gays and lesbians clearly was: Conform or you will be at least marginalized and, perhaps, demonized.  What is surprising is Corber's main premise that liberals primarily sought to &quot;manage and contain the demands of women and minorities for greater recognition.&quot;  This is a provocative thesis, and Corber uses the films made by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s &quot;to demonstrate how these liberals achieved and retained hegemony over American society in the 1950s by producing a united cultural front.&quot;  I disagree with some aspects of Corber's interpretation, but this is very interesting, occasionally exciting, reading.  <br />According to Corber, in The Vital Center, &quot;one of the most influential books of the postwar era, when Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., wanted to emphasize the conspiratorial nature of the American Communist Party, he compared it to gay male subculture.&quot;  Corber explains that Schlesinger's purpose was two-fold: &quot;it helped to consolidate the Cold War consensus by making membership in the Communist party and other forms of political dissent seem `unnatural'&quot; and &quot;it helped to insure that gender and nationality functioned as mutually reinforcing categories of identity by suggesting that engaging in homosexuality and other `perverted' sexual practices was un-American.&quot;  According to Corber: &quot;Americans who thought of themselves as part of the gay and lesbian subcultures that began to emerge in the postwar period in large urban areas...could be seen as disloyal citizens engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the American government.&quot;  This is a provocative theory.<br />If, for the sake of this discussion, we accept Corber's thesis that both Communists and gay men and lesbians were perceived in the 1950s as conspiring to overthrow American government, his approach to gender issues in Hitchcock's films, which are at the center of this book, is fascinating.  Corber's premise is &quot;to emphasize the extent to which to which the construction of gender and sexual identity was governed by the discourses of national security.&quot;  According to Corber: &quot;Examining Hitchcock's films in the context of the emergence and consolidation of the national security state suggests that the juridical construction of `the homosexual' and `the lesbian' as security risks provided the American government with a mechanism for containing resistance to the postwar settlement.&quot;  Corber seeks &quot;to establish the crucial connections between gender, national identity, and national security in postwar American society.&quot;  According to Corber: &quot;I want to show that in the 1950s the construction of male and female subjectivity was conditioned by the identification of homosexuality and lesbianism as threats to national security.&quot;   Corber makes his case most effectively in discussing two of Hitchcock's films: &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951) and &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959).  According to Corber, the former was based on Patricia Highsmith's &quot;blatantly homophobic novel, &quot; and &quot;identified individual conformity to the political and sexual norms sanctioned by the state as an act of supreme patriotism.&quot;  Corber writes: &quot;Strangers on a Train goes further than the federal government in attempting to police male same-sex behavior.&quot;  In Corber's view, this film &quot;shows that straights are...susceptible to blackmail.  Because their sexual identities are fluid and unstable, straights are incapable of resisting the sexual advances of gay men and lesbians.&quot;  Corber writes:  &quot;Hitchcock's film questions whether the threatened homosexualization of American society can be presented....The crisis over government employment of gay men and women who pass as straight appears to justify extreme measures.&quot;  According to Corber, Strangers on a Train &quot;helped to underwrite and consolidate the postwar settlement by ratifying the liberal critique of postwar American culture.&quot; <br />In Corber's view: &quot;North by Northwest stresses the way in which gender and nationality functioned as mutually reinforcing categories of identity in postwar America.&quot;   In this  film, in Corber's view, &quot;Hitchcock shows how the discourses of national security operate so as to contain resistance to the postwar settlement.&quot;  Corber writes: &quot;North by Northwest shows that the construction of gender and national identity anchored and guaranteed each other in post-war America.&quot;  Furthermore, according to Corber, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; helped &quot;to underwrite and consolidate the link between communism and homosexuality in the discourses of national security.&quot;  This is powerful film criticism, whether or not one accept's Corber's interpretation. <br />A large part of my disagreement with Corber involves chronology and causation.  In particular, I expect we would disagree about the answer to this question: Was the McCarthyism of the early 1950s determinative, or merely illustrative, of deep-seated fears of Communist subversion?  In the introduction, Corber refers to the &quot;the wave of anti-Communism unleashed by the McCarthy hearings.&quot;  In my opinion, this &quot;wave of anti-Communism&quot; began rolling several years before Senator McCarthy came to national prominence following a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, in February 1950.  McCarthyism was, therefore, a symptom, as well as a cause, of a larger phenomenon of political intolerance.  Indeed, Corber, himself, writes that Schlesinger's  The Vital Center, which was published in 1949, &quot;[c]ontribut[ed] to the anti-Communist hysteria then sweeping the nation.&quot;  McCarthy clearly exploited, but did not begin,the domestic anti-Communist crusade of the early Cold War.  Similarly, Hitchcock's films of the 1950s did not create, but merely reinforced, attitudes about the link between national-security issues and gender.   <br />Corber is a very sharp, imaginative, and incisive analyst of popular films.  Readers not intimately familiar with the films on which he focuses (and I am not) must, I suppose, accept his interpretations.  I suspect, however, that Corber reads too much into Hitchcock.  It is possible that these films were merely clever entertainments, without the deep and complex political content that Corber sees in them.  Because Corber's grasp of the history of the early Cold War era is less assured, I believe that many readers will find Corber's comments about Hitchcock's films far more persuasive than his approach to the history of the era.  But that does not detract from the fact that practically every page of this book is thought-provoking.	2000-12-23

As a result, this slim volume edited by Charles Neu, Professor of History at Brown University, is most valuable.  It contains only five essays, but they cover a broad spectrum of issues, from the effect of the Vietnam War on American society to an assessment of the impact on the conflict on the American military to a former Secretary of Defense's &quot;reflections&quot; on the war and related topics.  This book sheds considerable light on the most controversial foreign war in American history.<br />Professor Neu's opening essay sets the tone: &quot;The legacy of the Vietnam War is an unending topic.&quot;  According to Neu, the Vietnam War transformed the U.S. in various ways, including &quot;weakening all of those Cold War assumptions that had crystallized in the late 1940s and guided American leaders through the late 1960s&quot; and &quot;hasten[ing] the decline of the old foreign policy establishment.&quot;  The war also challenged the &quot;belief in national righteousness and providential destiny.&quot;  For combat soldiers, according to Neu: &quot;As the war went on, the confusion deepened and old myths dissolved.&quot;  In World War II, American soldiers &quot;generally had been hailed as liberators;&quot; in Vietnam, the peasantry was wary, if not hostile.  Neu implies that this contributed to break downs in discipline, the worst of which occurred in My Lai in 1968, when 400 civilians, including women and children were killed by American troops.  In concluding, Neu writes: &quot;Most Americans sensed that the nation had entered a new era after Vietnam, one that was filled with divisions, uncertainties, and moral confusion, both at home and abroad.&quot;<br />The essay written by Brian Balogh. Associate Professor of History at the University of Virginia, examines the war's &quot;domestic legacy.&quot;  Balogh observes that &quot;Vietnam shattered the myth ofAmerican invincibility&quot; and explains: &quot;Innocence and omnipotence lost shattered the perception of American exceptionalism.&quot;  In discussing &quot;the power of the Vietnam metaphor,&quot; Balogh asserts: &quot;Vietnam became the cause of many of America's problems.&quot;  In Balogh's view, Hollywood's treatment of Vietnam as a metaphor &quot;contributed to the impression that the war was behind everything - or at least everything bad - that was happening to America.&quot;  According to Balogh: &quot;The war and the movement against it seemed to devour every other concern.&quot;  Balogh concludes: &quot;Metaphors are bad for history&quot; because they are &quot;emotional shorthand that obscures complex causal relationships.&quot;  <br />George Herring, Professor of History at the University of Kentucky, focuses on the Vietnam War's &quot;profound impact on a once-proud U.S. military establishment.&quot;  Herring quotes an expert on military affairs that, as early as 1971, there was &quot;a state of approaching collapse.&quot;  According to Herring, the symptoms included &quot;the hippie-like appearance of GIs in the field,&quot; rising AWOL and desertion rates, an &quot;epidemic of `fragging' incidents,&quot; skyrocketing drug abuse, and mounting racial tensions.  The reason, according to Herring was that &quot;servicemen brought with them to Vietnam and other military posts the drug problems and racial tensions that wracked the United States,&quot; but he also acknowledges, as any honest critic must, that: &quot;The way the war was fought contributed decisively to the military breakdown.&quot; One study blamed &quot;the managerial revolution instituted at the Pentagon by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara&quot; for the services' &quot;focus on what could be quantified rather than the more abstract and elusive concept of leadership.&quot;  According to Herring: &quot;Within ten years of the fall of Saigon, a full-scale military resurgence was underway, and, by the mid-1980s, &quot;the military had rebuilt itself...[but] fears of another Vietnam still haunted its leaders.&quot;  In particular, in Herring's view, &quot;senior military leaders &quot;brought from Vietnam a keen sense of the limits of public tolerance for a protracted war.&quot;  Herring writes, that the Persian Gulf War was &quot;more about Vietnam than about Kuwait, oil, and Iraq.&quot;  According to Herring: &quot;The nation's smashing and stunningly easy victory in the Persian Gulf War seemed for many Americans - military and civilian - a long-awaited vindication.&quot;  Herring concludes: &quot;The legacy of Vietnam for the military has thus been enormous.&quot;    <br />Utilizing Vietnamese-language sources, Robert Brigham, Associate Professor of History at Vassar College, writes about politics in postwar Vietnam.  According to Brigham, the Vietnamese Communist Party created &quot;national heroes out of those who sacrificed for the revolution,&quot; and the &quot;pantheon of champions&quot; included Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap.  At the same time, a new constitution was adopted in 1980, which created a Council of State, and, according to Brigham, this &quot;institutionalized the [Vietnamese Communist Party's] commitment to shared power.&quot;  (Brigham quotes an editor that, &quot;[d]uring the tension of the war all decision-making was concentrated in the hands of a few men and they had become over-confident.&quot;)  According to Brigham's, post-war Vietnamese society has treated the war leaders as revolutionary heroes, but their methods of governing have been dramatically altered.<br />Robert McNamara is the only non-academic contributor to this volume, but his perspective is worthwhile.  For instance, one of his conclusions is that the &quot;United States should never apply its economic, political, or military power other than in a multilateral context,&quot; except in the event of a &quot;direct threat to the security&quot; of the U.S.McNamara explains that this is the &quot;lesson we should have learned in Vietnam: external military force has only a limited capacity to facilitate the process of nation building.&quot;  I found McNamara's wide-ranging essay intelligent and well-meaning, but it addressed issues beyond Vietnam, and I suspect that some readers will join McNamara's critics (and there remain many of them) in holding that anything he has to say, except in abject apology for being the architect of U.S. Vietnam policy, is not welcomed.      <br />These essays are selective, addressing only some of the important historical issues emanating from the Vietnam War, but the perspectives offered by Neu, Balogh, and Herring, in particular, add substance to the ongoing debate.  Together, they demonstrate that the legacies of this conflict are many and complex, both in the United States and Vietnam.	2000-12-22

Nevertheless, there always have been poor.  This complex study by James Patterson, Professor of History at Brown University, seeks to explain the coexistence of wealth and poverty people in American society during the last century.  In the process, Patterson makes a number of incisive observations about the nature of poverty.  In the preface to the current edition, written in 1994, Patterson provocatively asserts his &quot;continuing belief that poverty in the United States is not only a major concern - [is] perhaps the biggest the nation faces.&quot;  This book is not easy reading, but it is essential for anyone seeking to understand an important issue in American politics at the beginning of the 21st century.<br />Patterson's explication of competing theoretical approaches to the problem of poverty is excellent.  In speaking about the 1940s and 1950s, Patterson identifies three &quot;overlapping insights,&quot; although it is clear that these schools of thought evolved and recurred over the course of the century.  The cultural anthropological perspective asserted that &quot;class and poverty were cultural instead of economic&quot; and that the behavior of poor people &quot;is usually a perfectly realistic, adaptive, and - in slum life - socially acceptable response to reality.&quot;    The liberal view originally expected the &quot;economic revival of 1940-42 [to] solve the problem of destitution, [but] they insisted that welfare must remain an important element in public policy.&quot;  The structuralists, according to Patterson, also &quot;assumed the long-term need for extensive need for extensive public welfare&quot; but also sought &quot;major initiatives to counter low wages and underemployment.&quot;  In the middle of the book, Patterson makes the astute, invaluable point that &quot;policy formation rarely follows from a single intellectual perspective,&quot; and the implication is that legislated poverty programs often have drawn from two or more of these perspectives. <br />Patterson writes: The economic growth between 1900 and 1929 prompted great optimism among social scientists.&quot;  According to Patterson: &quot;Some reformers, reflecting the optimism of the age, rejoiced that `public welfare' was replacing&quot; older philosophies.  During the crisis of the Great Depression in the1930s, some social workers feared the creation of a &quot;permanent relief class,&quot; and President Roosevelt stated that he meant to get the federal government to &quot;quit this business of relief.&quot;  Although the &quot;early welfare state&quot; offered &quot;categorical assistance for the needy over sixty-five, blind people, and dependent children,&quot; Patterson writes that a &quot;distaste for welfare&quot; persisted. When general prosperity returned during the 1940s, according to Patterson, it was &quot;mainly the result of heavy government spending during World War II.&quot;  That led to renewed optimism about ending poverty through economic growth, alone, and it was not until the early 1960s, as Patterson puts it, that Americans &quot;rediscovered&quot; poverty.  By 1960, Patterson writes, urban areas &quot;became the main locus of poverty.&quot;  In 1962, social reformer Michael Harrington wrote about &quot;a `new' hard-core poor of old people, female-headed households, and minority groups.&quot;   For them, according to critics of the system, welfare was inadequate.  Since the 1960s, and, indeed, throughout the 20th century, a principle issue has been how to provide for the &quot;deserving&quot; needy without encouraging a culture of welfare dependence.  Patterson returns to this problem several times, and it remains at the core of the poverty problem.                                 Early in 1964, Lyndon Johnson declared a &quot;war on poverty,&quot;the most ambitious effort to attack the problem since the New Deal era.  According to Patterson, Johnson &quot;looked upon his program as a way of lessening welfare dependency.&quot;  The Johnson administration's efforts did not eradicate poverty, but, according to Patterson, it &quot;had the unanticipated consequence of helping to arouse the poor.&quot;  Concomitantly, the attitudes of middle-class Americans hardened, and, Patterson writes, they &quot;continued to stereotype the poor disparagingly and to recoil at the thought of expanding welfare.&quot;  Between 1965 and 1975, there was an &quot;explosive growth of the welfare rolls, of AFDC,&quot; and critics &quot;blamed AFDC for contributing to illegitimacy and family breakup.&quot;  Furthermore, there was the longstanding concern that &quot;categorical assistance programs destroyed people's incentives to work.&quot;  By about 1970, as Patterson puts it, there was a &quot;fundamental idea that America had a `welfare crisis&quot; and this idea was buttressed by what Patterson describes as an &quot;explosion in welfare rolls.&quot;<br />Patterson writes: &quot;The Carter administration struggled to find an approach that could accommodate liberals and mollify conservatives,&quot; but &quot;Carter's welfare program bogged down in Congress.&quot;  The Reagan administration did not fare much better, and, several years after he left office, President Reagan stated: &quot;We fought a war on poverty, and poverty won.&quot;  The result, according to Patterson, was &quot;continued stalemate and frustration.&quot;  In Patterson's view: &quot;The deepest structural problem of the late 1980s and early 1990s, most experts agreed, was the sluggishness of the American economy.&quot;  In 1992, Bill Clinton campaigned on a promise &quot;to end welfare as we know it.&quot;  But in the mid-1990s, Patterson writes, policy-makers were still reaching for &quot;the elusive goal of ensuring more substantial economic opportunity and security for all citizens.&quot;  Patterson concludes on this pessimistic note: &quot;Barring substantial improvements in the economy, poverty seemed likely to persist as one of the ugliest blights on American society.&quot;    <br />Patterson ably demonstrates that the history of poverty programs in the United States is controversial and very complicated.  Nevertheless, some clear themes emerge.  Until 1929, there was a general optimism that continuous growth of the American economy was inevitable.  The Great Depression destroyed that assumption.  Massive government spending in preparation for and during World War II restored general prosperity, but segments of the population remained locked in near-perpetual poverty.  There is now a nearly-universal consensus for social programs for the needy over age 65, blind people, and dependent children, but this issue persists: What can be done to guarantee secure, well-paying jobs for all American adults who want, but cannot find, them?  As Patterson makes clear in this lucid study, until that problem is solved, poverty will continue to be one of the great concerns of American society.	2000-12-21
US	50862643	R1UJBRY0RH0Y71	0674000811	89670342	Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A Pragmatist in an Intensely-Ideological World	Dean Acheson, who served as Harry Truman's Secretary of State from 1949 until 1953, was in that office during a series of momentous events.  This was the period when the People's Republic of China emerged victorious from the Chinese civil war, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was organized, the Korean War started, and the superpowers' nuclear arms race commenced in earnest.  It is no wonder, therefore, that Acheson entitled his State Department memoir Present at the Creation and that his biographer James Chace, who teaches at Bard College, paraphrased that title for the sub-title to this book.  Acheson was a great Secretary of State, and, although I believe that this biography is longer on description than insight, it is a very good narrative of one of the exceptional public careers of the 20th century.<br />At the risk of stereotyping, Acheson was Eastern establishment to his viscera.  The son of the Episcopal Bishop of Connecticut, young Dean went to Groton School (where Franklin Roosevelt also received his secondary education), Yale College, and Harvard Law School.  After clerking for Justice Louis Brandeis and making the acquaintance of the Supreme Court's other Olympian figure, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Acheson practiced law at a prestigious firm in Washington, D.C.  Acheson was a good enough lawyer to have been offered a federal appellate-court judgeship in the mid-1930s, and he was under consideration for appointment as Solicitor General when President Roosevelt died in 1945.  But it is, of course, as a long-time State Department official that Acheson is best known.  <br />Acheson intellectual eminence is obvious, but Chace makes clear that, as Secretary of State, Acheson was an implementer, not an innovator.  Acheson believed strongly that foreign policy was made in the White House, and, according to Chace, Acheson brought a &quot;relentlessly pragmatic approach&quot; to serving the will first of Franklin Roosevelt and then of Harry Truman.But some Acheson-era policies clearly were rooted in his attitudes.  In the 1930s, Acheson supported an &quot;interventionist foreign policy,&quot; and, in 1939, two years before the United States entered World War II, Acheson favored a &quot;military and naval buildup&quot; as part of what he called a &quot;realistic American policy.&quot;  These were to be recurrent themes during Acheson's State Department years.  I was surprised, therefore, by how little thought was given to the post-war world until virtually the end of World War II.  Chace entitles one of his chapters about the early Cold War &quot;No Grand Strategy,&quot; but that phrase could have been applied to the entire era.  Part of the problem, as Chace makes clear, was the sheer technical difficulty of some of the issues.  For instance, in discussing what we now know was the beginning of the nuclear arms race, Chace writes that &quot;Acheson was well aware of his own limitations in understanding the scientific aspects of atomic energy.&quot;  Chace repeats an often-told, but splendid, anecdote about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the principal organizer of the Manhattan project which designed and built the first atomic bomb, trying to explain to Acheson and another high government official some arcane point in nuclear physics and then stating is exasperation: &quot;It's hopeless!  I really think you two believe neutrons and electrons are little men.&quot;  It is understandable that even the well-educated Acheson struggled with cutting-edge scientific concepts.  What is more difficult to comprehend is why Acheson was not better prepared for the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist forces in China in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War the next year.  Chace explains that &quot;myriad problems [faced] the new secretary  <br />This book constitutes very solid biographical writing, but it has surprisingly little personal color.  Although Acheson was famous (or infamous) for having one of the sharpest tonguesin Washington, D.C., it is only rarely on display.  But, when Chace shows this side of Acheson, it is wonderful.  For instance, in a latter to Harry Truman, Acheson referred to the Bay of Pigs disaster as &quot;this asinine Cuban adventure.&quot;  In an interview several years after President Kennedy was assassinated, Acheson told an interviewer that Kennedy &quot;did not seem to me to be in any sense a great man.&quot;  ....  And, while serving as one of Lyndon Johnson's &quot;Wise Men,&quot; Acheson instructed Johnson's national security adviser on one occasion to tell the President to &quot;take Vietnam and stick it up his a--.&quot;  Chace's approach to his subject tends to be too reverential.  There is plenty about Acheson to admire, but this book's readers would have benefitted from a more thorough exposition of his human, fallible side.<br />This probably is as close as we will come to a definitive biography of Acheson.  If one also considers Acheson's State Department memoir, which received the Pulitzer Prize in 1969, there may not be much more to say.  Nevertheless, I believe that some questions remain.  Most prominently, how do we reconcile Acheson the international Cold Warrior with Acheson the bitter opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy?  Can we separate the obvious threat to American national-security interests in the late 1940s and early 1950s from the clearly-exaggerated perception that there was an equally serious internal security threat to the United States?  In particular, I wish that Chace had considered the possibility that Acheson was Dr. Frankenstein to McCarthy's monster....  But the men may have had more in common than either would have been willing to admit.  In the final analysis, however, this biography should be taken on its own terms, and, my criticisms notwithstanding, it is very good.	2000-12-17
US	50862643	R39X79XTJL7XBS	0385493282	556829614	The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin	Books	4	10	24	N	N	A Great American Life	Although I do not agree with Author H.W. Brands, Professor of History at Texas A &amp; M University, that Benjamin Franklin was the foremost member of the revolutionary-founding generation of the American republic (in my opinion, that accolade remains the due of George Washington), this is an excellent narrative of Franklin's long life and important contributions to his times.  To say that Benjamin Franklin is one of the outstanding examples of the self-made man in American history is also to summarize his greatness in a nutshell, and Brands's presentation of Franklin's life from modest beginnings to national leadership is one of the book's most impressive strengths.  Indeed, I preferred this aspect of the biography to the long and meticulous, but not always enlightening, narrative of Franklin's public career. On balance, this book has many more strengths than weaknesses.<br />Franklin was born in Boston in 1705 and arrived in Philadelphia, the city in which he is primarily associated, in 1723.  Even at age 18, Franklin was independent of his family, and he earned everything he achieved.  With the help and encouragement of the provincial governor of Pennsylvania, Franklin became a printer, and that was the earliest source of his fame.  His Pennsylvania Gazette, according to Brands, &quot;grew into the leading newspaper&quot; in Pennsylvania in the 1730s, and Franklin also published his famous almanacs.  Franklin should come immediately to mind in any discussion of the greatest self-made Americans.  Franklin's long and active life brought him into contact with virtually all of the great political, social, and cultural events of his time.  For instance, in the late 1730s, Franklin met the English preacher George Whitefield, whom Brands describes as &quot;the most charismatic man Franklin ever met - perhaps the most charismatic man to speak the English language during Franklin's lifetime.&quot;  Franklin was a freethinker in religious matters and occasionally even anticlerical, but he befriended Whitefield.  Part of Franklin's motivation was pragmatic: He published Whitefield's sermons and journals in several installments, as well as the theologian's memoirs.  This is important because, as Brands writes, &quot;many historians would see the roots of the American Revolution in the turmoil&quot; produced by the Great Awakening, of which Whitefield was a leading proponent.<br />Franklin was considered a great American sage throughout the comparatively short road to independence.  At the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the American colonies were solid in their attachment to Great Britain.  As early as the Stamp Act crisis of the mid-1760s, however, one group of opponents of the Act called themselves the Sons of Liberty.  By the time of the Boston Tea Party in December 1773, parts of the colonies were in open defiance of the Crown.  Independence was declared in July 1776.  Franklin was an important actor in most of the events.  Early in the book, Brands makes the key observation that, &quot;[t]empermentally, Franklin was a skeptic rather than a rebel.&quot;  That appears to be accurate, and, in my opinion, it undermines Brands's thesis that Franklin was the leader in the movement toward independence.  But it helps to explain the value of Franklin's wisdom to that movement.  Franklin was one of the most pragmatic men of this or any era.  For instance, he had that rare and valuable quality which we now characterize as being a good listener.  When the Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in the spring of 1775, after the battles of Lexington and Concord, which effectively began the Revolutionary War, Brands writes that &quot;Franklin disappointed some of those who knew him only by reputation...[because] [h]e struck no lightning bolts of rhetoric, preferring to sit silent while others orated.  Washington cut a far more impressive figure in his soldier's uniform than Franklin in his philosopher's coat.&quot;  By this time, Franklin was nearly 70, and I am inclined to think that his contributions may have been more symbolic than practical.  Franklin was a member of the  committee which drafted the Declaration of Independence, but, according to Brands, he &quot;had little to do with the first drafting of the document, which the committee left to&quot; Thomas Jefferson.  However, Brands writes, Franklin made a delightful, if apocryphal, contribution to the deliberations.  When it was suggested that Congress's support of the Declaration be unanimous, the old, wise Franklin advised his colleagues, &quot;we must indeed hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;  After independence, according to Brands, worked on a new constitution for Pennsylvania and was elected by the Assembly to be president of its Committee of Public Safety.  His most important role during the Revolutionary War, however, was as the leading member of the three-man diplomatic commission to France, which sought to obtain arms and an alliance.  Brands writes: &quot;Franklin's arrival in Paris was a personal triumph....Franklin offered something to almost everyone in France.  He was a philosopher to the liberal philosophes, an ardent foe of Britain...to the conservatives who hungered for revenge against perfidious Albion, a wit to the habitués of the salons, a prophet of profits to the makers of weapons and outfitters of privateers.&quot;  For nearly two years, Franklin and his fellow commissioners labored with only limited success, but, shortly after the battle of Saratoga in October 1777, the first important American victory in the war, the obtained an alliance, &quot;pledging French support for American independence.&quot;   It was, in many respects, the high point of Franklin's public career. <br />How can one not be impressed by Benjamin Franklin?  A successful, self-made businessman, perhaps the most accomplished amateur scientist of his era, an able and dedicated public servant, and the grey eminence to the revolutionary and founding generation.  Even if Franklin was not the foremost American of his time, to be considered in the same light as George Washington, Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson, to name just a few, was an extraordinary achievement for a man from humble origins.  This may not be a great biography, but Franklin led a great American life.	2000-12-10

Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book about a marine officer's experience during the Korean War.  It was easy reading, its narrative was straightforward, informative, and, I believe, honest, and it provided some valuable insights into the harsh realities of the first of the Cold War's regional conflicts.<br />The United States' &quot;forgotten war&quot; began on June 25, 1950, when the People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) invaded the Republic of Korea (South Korea).  At the time, Author Joseph Owen was a Marine Corps lieutenant stationed in North Carolina, living with his wife and their two young children.  According to Owen: &quot;Nobody at Camp Lejeune had expected a shooting war.  Nor were we ready for one.&quot;  A captain who had been an adviser to the South Korean Marine Corps predicted Korea would be &quot;[o]ne lousy place to fight a war.  Too hot in summer, too cold in winter, and straight up and down mountain terrains all year round.  Except for those stinking rice paddies down in the valleys.  Human manure they use.  Worst stink in the world.&quot;  Nevertheless, according to Owen: &quot;The possibility of American Marines in a combat role excited us.&quot;  Owen writes: &quot;The North Koreans continued to overpower the meager resistance offered by the South Korean soldiers....Seoul, the South Korean capital, fell with hardly a fight, and the Red blitzkrieg rolled southward.  In response, President Truman escalated American involvement in the war.  He ordered General MacArthur, America's supreme commander in the Far East, to use U.S. Army troops stationed in Japan to stem the invaders.&quot;  And: &quot;General MacArthur called for a full division of Marines to help him turn back the North Koreans.   According to Owen: &quot;The Marine Corps welcomed the call, but we did not have a full division to put in the field;&quot; and &quot;More than seven thousand of us at Camp Lejeune received orders to proceed by rail to Camp Pendleton.  There they would form into companies and embark for Korea.&quot;  Owen's unit, &quot;Baker-One-Seven became one of three rifle companies if the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment....Our ranks were filled by 215 men and 7 officers who had never before served together....Many of [the privates] were beardless teenagers with little training beyond the basics of shouldering a rifle and marching in step.&quot;  While training, there was much concern about the readiness of the Marines for combat.  At one point, after a sergeant remarks that the troops need more training in boot camp, Owen succinctly invokes reality: &quot;They are not going to boot camp.  They are going aboard ship.  And they are going to fight.&quot;  On September 1, the company boarded a Navy transport for the three-week voyage to east Asia.  According to Owen: &quot;Ready or not, we were on the way to war.&quot;  And, according to Owen, the 1st Marine Division's orders were &quot;to go for the Yalu River,&quot; North Korea's border with China.  At one point, a veteran officer provides this paraphrase of William Tecumseh Sherman's famous dictum: &quot;War is hell, but you never know what particular kind of hell it's going to be.&quot;  The Korean War hell was cold and barren.  Owen writes: &quot;We were chilled through and bone tired as we slogged our way back to battalion....The bivouac was lumpy with rocks and boulders;&quot; &quot;The cold weather was as formidable an enemy as the Chinese;&quot; and &quot;Rarely did the [daily action] reports exceed zero degrees, and there were lows of twenty below.&quot;      <br />By the time Owen's outfit arrived in Korea, he writes, &quot;we were making bets that the war would be over before we got into it.&quot;  Owen's Marines could not have been more wrong.  While Owen is inspecting his men's weapons, a private asks: &quot;Think we'll get shot at today, Lieutenant?&quot;  Owen replies: &quot;We're taking the point for the regiment.  If the gooks are there, they'll be shooting at us.&quot;  A few pages later, after the outfit's first experience in combat, Owen comments: &quot;We were fortunate that the enemy had not chosen a &quot;fight-to-the-death&quot; defense of this hill, as they would when we advanced farther north.&quot;  But some fighting was hand-to-hand.  At one point, Owen writes: &quot;Judging from the noise they were making, and the direction of their grenades, the North Koreans were preparing to attack, not more than thirty yards away.&quot;  The Captain tells Owen and the other subordinate officers: &quot;The Chinese have committed themselves to this war....The people we will fight are the 124th Division of the Regular Chinese Army....They're tough, well-trained soldiers, ten thousand of them.  And all of their officers are combat experienced, their very best....A few hours from now we'll have the Chinese army in our gunsights.  We'll be in their gunsights.  You damn well better have our people ready for some serious fighting.&quot;  The combat was, indeed, brutal.  According to Owen: &quot;The Chinese attacked in massive numbers, an overwhelming weight, but they also endured terrible casualties.&quot;  Owen recalls that, while waiting for one Chinese attack, the &quot;men stacked Chinese bodies in front of the holes for greater protection.&quot;  And the fighting around the frozen Chosin Reservoir may have been the most brutal of the war.  Owen ultimately suffered wounds requiring 17 months of treatment, and he never regained full use of one arm.<br />A few months ago, I reviewed James Brady's wonderful The Coldest War: A Memoir of Korea here.  This book has different charms.  Whereas Brady is a gifted professional writer, there is no elegant prose here.  But Owen provides an equally vivid account of this ugly war.  Big, sophisticated studies of military history focusing on geopolitical principles and grand strategy rarely offer narrative moments like the ones in this book.  Reader are unlikely to forget the Korean War after reading Joseph Owen's Colder than Hell.	2000-12-08
US	50862643	R3EESKE6MC5AU3	0300084625	883424280	Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (Yale Nota Bene)	Books	4	42	48	N	N	Spying on an Ally in Time of War	This is really two books in one: The first is a slim, but absolutely fascinating, volume about &quot;Venona,&quot; the code name for the program in which approximately 3,000 extremely-secret cable messages sent by KGB agents in the United States to the Soviet Union were deciphered and translated from Russian between 1946 and 1981 by American counterintelligence authorities.  The other is a rather conventional survey of Soviet espionage in the United States in the 20th century and its purported connection to the American Communist Party.  At the very end of the book, authors John Early Haynes and Harvey Klehr assert that, &quot;from 1942 to 1945[,] the Soviet Union launched an unrestrained espionage offensive against the United States.&quot;  The now-indisputable fact that a state at war spied aggressively on one of its own allies is at the heart of this book. <br />According to Haynes and Klehr: &quot;This book describes Soviet espionage in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s.  It concentrates on operations during World War II, the most aggressive and effective phase of Soviet activity.&quot;  The authors write: &quot;Venona decryptions identified most of the Soviet spies uncovered by American counterintelligence between 1948 and the mid-1950s.&quot;  Haynes and Klehr report that Klaus Fuchs, Julius Rosenberg, and Donald Maclean, among others, were Soviet spies identified through Venona documents.   However, the authors make the controversial assertion that their book &quot;shows how the success of the wartime espionage offensive rested on the extensive base prepared in the 1930s by the Communist International and the American Communist Party.&quot;  In law school, students are taught to beware of this false maxim: &quot;After, therefore, because.&quot;   In other words, the fact that one event follows another in time does not necessarily mean that the first causes the second.  I am skeptical of the implication that the activities of the American Communist Party in the 1930s caused, or even contributed to, the success of Soviet agents in the United States during World War II.  <br />The first chapter, entitled &quot;Venona and the Cold War,&quot; which seeks to place the deciphered messages into historical context, is splendid.  The most intriguing section of this chapter, in my opinion, revolves around a counterfactual: What would have happened if Soviet agents had not succeeded in penetrating the Manhattan Project, as a result of which the Soviet Union had not developed its atomic bomb until after Stalin's death in 1953.  According to Haynes and Klehr: &quot;It is doubtful that Stalin, rarely a risk-taker, would have supplied the military wherewithal and authorized North Korea to invade South Korea in 1950 had the Soviet Union not exploded an atomic bomb in 1949.&quot;  That is not quite a revelation, but it is a very interesting idea.   And Chapter 2, which describes how the Soviet code was broken, is a great detective story, as well as an excellent introduction to the world of counterintelligence.  As Haynes and Klehr write, the United States' National Security Agency had the worldwide resources &quot;to attack the Soviet cipher,&quot; and its efforts, although laborious, proved to be a brilliant success.  According to the authors, in addition to many other benefits: &quot;Venona provided the FBI and the CIA with crucial information about the professional practices and habits of Soviet intelligence. agencies....Young [Soviet] intelligence officers who show up often in Venona continued to serve with the KGB into the 1980s.&quot;   Haynes and Klehr also write: &quot;Soviet cryptographic officials had great confidence in the unbreakability of their one-time pad and appear to have done little about early reports of attacks upon it.&quot;  According to the authors, Venona was eventually exposed by Soviet agents, including the notorious H.R. &quot;Kim&quot; Philby, a senior British intelligence officer stationed in Washington, D.C., who had access to Venona information until the summer of 1951 and later defected to the Soviet Union.  The first 60 pages or so of this book are positively riveting.  (So is the appendix in which Haynes and Klehr provide an annotated list of 349 &quot;U.S. citizens, noncitizen immigrants, and permanent residents of the United States who had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence that is confirmed in the Venona traffic.&quot;  Alger Hiss's name appears on this list, and it is now virtually impossible for any reasonable person to deny Hiss's connection with the Soviet Union's intelligence apparatus.)  I would enthusiastically recommend this book just for its presentation of the Venona material.  It was as interesting as anything I have read about the Cold War in quite a long time.  The text which follows the Venona chapters is less compelling.  Haynes and Klehr's description of the &quot;American Communist Party underground,&quot; various espionage networks, and the Soviet Union's &quot;friends in high places&quot; is interesting but only confirms what has previously been published.  I suspect that the authors realized that this ground had been plowed before because, for instance, they only devote about five pages to Hiss, the accusations against whom have been the subject of several books, both pro and con.  But the chapters entitled &quot;Military Espionage&quot; and &quot;Industrial and Atomic Espionage&quot; are well worth reading. <br />In their final chapter, entitled &quot;Soviet Espionage and American History,&quot; Haynes and Klehr candidly concede: &quot;While the Venona cables document Soviet penetration of the American government, they are of less assistance in determining how much damage Soviet spies did to American security.&quot;  My own conclusion is that, while Soviet espionage in the United States may not have been widespread in the middle decades of the century, when Soviet spies were successful, as in their penetration of the Manhattan Project, the damage was enormous.  Haynes and Klehr appear to concur: &quot;The major exception to the lack of specific knowledge bears on atomic espionage....Espionage saved the USSR great expense and industrial investment and thereby enabled the Soviets to build a successful atomic bomb years before they otherwise would have.&quot;  Like most good history, this book is a cautionary tale: One lesson clearly is that the United States cannot be too careful about protecting the security of its nuclear weapons and related technology.	2000-12-01

Weigley is one of the pre-eminent military historians in the country, and his The American Way of War&quot; A History of United States Military Strategy and Politics is a classic. Professor Weigley's current volume, A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History, is a solid survey of its topic but I believe that it adds relatively little to our understanding of the four-year conflict which is the great turning point in American history. In his bibliography, Weigley candidly refers to James M. McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, published in 1988 as the &quot;best comprehensive one-volume history,&quot; and so it remains.  If the leading authorities had to choose, I suspect that most would continue to recommend Battle Cry of Freedom.  As a result, Weigley's book will be of interest mostly to Civil War enthusiasts, like me, who never can get enough.<br />As befits a leading military history with broad knowledge of his field, one of Weigley's strengths is presenting the Civil War in context: I found the section of the introduction entitled &quot;Nineteenth-Century Americans at War&quot; and the sections in the second chapter entitled &quot;Napoleonic War&quot; and &quot;War in a New Style&quot; especially interesting.  When democracies go to war, military decisions and politics cannot be separated, and Weigley wisely interweaves the two subjects in his narrative.  Central to Weigley's interpretation of the war is this passage: General Robert E. Lee &quot;rightly believed that the longer the war, the smaller the Confederacy's chances of winning it, because of the relative scarcity of Confederate resources.  The South's best hope of keeping the war short lay in the Washington-Richmond theater.&quot;  In this, I believe Weigley is absolutely correct.  Although the war raged at various times from Pennsylvania to Texas and from the Atlantic Ocean across the Mississippi River, the conflict's most important events generally occurred in northern Virginia and its environs.  General Lee's campaigns which ended at the battles of Antietam in September 1862 and Gettysburg in July 1863 were attempts to pose threats to the national capital so severe that the Union government would be forced to sue for peace, allowing the Confederate States of America to go their own way.  Weigley's presentation of these critical campaigns are stronger on description than analysis of their consequences.  However, Weigley make some telling statements of fact and observation about the key players. Early in the war, Lee &quot;was widely distrusted in the Confederacy.&quot; General George B. McClellan, who commanded the federal forces around Washington D.C., during the first two years of the war, tended to avoid combat because &quot;[l]aboring under the terrible responsibility of dispatching men to die, he apparently found the prospect of actually witnessing many of the deaths more than he could bear.&quot;  According to Weigley, General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; &quot;Jackson's flank march to Manassas Junction [for the Second Battle of Bull Run] had been a Napoleonic manoeuvre sur les derrières as brilliantly executed as any by Napoleon himself.&quot; And, about the brutally-destructive Union campaign in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia in 1864, Weigley writes: &quot;A pillar of fire marked [General Philip] Sheridan's route northward...[I]n Sheridan's interpretation of what was necessary to deny sustenance to the rebel army, barns, mills, and corn-cribs all went to the torch.  When occasionally a fire spread to a barn or farmhouse, that was unfortunate but part of the chances of war.&quot;  <br />Weigley makes some curious choices.  For instance, he devotes over four full pages to &quot;Pea Ridge: The Great Battle of the Trans-Mississippi,&quot; in March 1862, which is noteworthy, as Weigley observes, primarily because it was &quot;one of the few major Civil War engagements in which the Federals were substantially outnumbered,&quot; but less than a page to the battle of Fredericksburg in December of that year, when the Army of Northern Virginia mauled a considerably larger Federal force as it futilely assaulted Confederate forces dug into the high ground overlooking the Rappahannock River in this central Virginia city.  Fredericksburg is significant in its own right, as well as because of the influence it had on the battle of Gettysburg; in the rolling hills of south-central Pennsylvania in July 1863, the Federals offered battle precisely because they held the high ground along Cemetery Ridge, and Confederate General James Longstreet's hesitated to assault the far right of the Federal position on the critical second day of the battle as a result, as Weigley notes, from Longstreet's fear of a &quot;foredoomed Fredericksburg in reverse.&quot;  In a book of only 450 pages of text, hard choices are necessary: Pea Ridge was noteworthy, but, in the grand scope of the war, Fredericksburg was more significant.     Weigley might also have devoted more attention to comparing the presidents of the warring nations, Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. Weigley could have made the point that Lincoln, a president without a West Point education and experience as Secretary of War, largely had to leave matters of tactics, if not strategy, to his generals.  But Davis had both that education and experience, as a result of which he spent most of the war meddling.  In contrast, Weigley's comparison of President Lincoln with General McClellan, and especially their conflicting views about the war's purpose is splendid.  (McClellan was eventually relieved of command and ran against Lincoln for the presidency in 1864.)  There is absolutely no question about Weigley's command of the material.  When I am critical, it is only of the author's execution of the daunting task of compressing that material into a cohesive narrative of approximately 450 pages.  <br />A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History is written in smooth but not especially compelling style.  I enjoyed reading it because the military history of the Civil War is among my favorite subjects, but I cannot honestly recommend this book as superior to previous one-volume histories, most notably McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom.  Although Weigley is an exceptionally accomplished military historian, this book does not quite carry the day.	2000-11-28

According to Seymour Martin Lipset, who currently teaches at George Mason University of Virginia, and Gary Marks of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, they are addressing &quot; a classic question of American historiography.&quot;  That is an accurate assessment, and the authors tackle it with intelligence, imagination, and useful comparative analysis.  In an era of global capitalism triumphant, I suspect that most readers will not be interested in a long, albeit erudite, discussion of why the working-class challenge to industrial capitalism failed in the United States.  Nevertheless, I recommend this book because it offers deep insights into American society which go far beyond answering the narrow question presented in the title.  <br />Lipset and Marks present three principal reasons for the failure of socialism in the United States.  First, that it is &quot;but one instance of the ineffectiveness of third parties in the United States over the last century.&quot;  Second, socialists and labor unionists &quot;never succeeded in bringing the major union movement, the American Federation of Labor and later the AFL-CIO, to support and independent working-class political party.&quot;   Third, &quot;immigration created an extremely diverse labor force in which class coherence was undermined by ethnic, racial, and religious identity.&quot;  Lipset and Marks devote a long, detailed chapter to each reason, and they are the heart of the book, along with the authors' fascinating discussion of the socialists' tendency to battle among themselves over issues of &quot;ideological purity.&quot;  Rarely has the history of the American labor movement and its political failures been surveyed so effectively.<br />Even general readers will instantly grasp why, asLipset and Marks put it, the Great Depression &quot;presented the Socialists with their final opportunity to build a viable political party.&quot; Especially in the early 1930s, in the authors view, &quot;[r]ampant poverty, mass unemployment, widespread bankruptcies, and the public's general uncertainty about the future gave the Socialists grounds for believing that they could finally create a durable mass movement.&quot;   That failed to happen and, in 1932, the Socialist candidate for president received only 2.5% of the total popular vote.  The authors write: &quot;Socialists were bitterly disappointed by the vote for [Norman] Thomas in 1932.&quot;  Even in this time of obvious economic crisis, most American voters refused to turn to a third party.  One reason certainly was the Socialists' extreme positions.  According to Lipset and Marks,  &quot;the majority of Socialists stood far to the left in the first years of the Roosevelt administration, sharply attacking the New Deal as state capitalism.&quot;  President Roosevelt shrewdly adopted &quot;leftist rhetoric,&quot; offered &quot;progressive policies in exchange for support from radical and economically depressed constituencies,&quot; and recruited &quot;actual leaders of protest groups by convincing them that they were part of his coalition.&quot;  At the end of their chapter on the 1930s, Lipset and Marks conclude that the &quot;Great Depression politicized American labor,&quot; but the political party which labor embraced was the Democrats, not the Socialists.   After World War II, socialism never had a chance.  Communists and their fellow travelers were demonized, and leftists of all other shades were marginalized.  In contrast with the conventional wisdom, Lipset and Marks make the important observation that &quot;the Communists had lost most of their influence and membership before (Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist) crusade.&quot;  They assert correctly, therefore, that &quot;the long history of repression of American socialists cannot explain their failure to establish a viable political party.&quot;  I take that remark to mean that repression, alone, does not account for the failure of socialism in the United States, but it certainly was a factor.  <br />Lipset and Marks wisely concede early in the book that the question they pose - Why did socialism fail in the United States? - &quot;may never be ultimately resolved.&quot;  But, at the beginning of their final chapter, the authors come close to an authoritative answer when they incisively observe that the &quot;United States is the only Western democracy to have a party system dominated by two parties, both of which are sympathetic to liberal capitalism and neither of which has inherited a socialist or social democratic vision of society.&quot;  Lipset and Marks explain: &quot;Distinctive elements of American culture - antistatism and individualism - negated the appeal of socialism for the mass of American workers for much of the twentieth century.  Socialism, with its emphasis on statism, socialization of the means of production, and equality through taxation, are at odds with the dominant values of American culture.&quot;  More than anything else, therefore, socialism may have conflicted with the American political tradition and its long-standing social and economic ideals.  <br />Lipset and Marks are correct that socialism promises &quot;to eliminate poverty, racism, sexism, pollution, and war,&quot; and its program clearly has its attractions, especially, as the authors observe, &quot;to the idealism inherent in the position of young people and intellectuals.&quot;  However, some of the most attractive features of the socialist platform have been coopted by the mainstream political parties.  This may explain why moderate middle-class reform in the 200h century (progressivism, the New Deal, and the Great Society) has succeeded, while its working-class variant (socialism) failed.  This book is not merely about of why socialism did not take root in the United States.  It is about the essential characteristics of the political and socio-economic order in American society.	2000-11-27
US	50862643	R3PQY6PS3HU67W	0375402101	464262522	Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture	Books	3	32	80	N	N	Bearing Firearms in Theory and Practice	Michael A. Bellesiles's ambitious Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture posits, as the title indicates, the existence of a &quot;national gun culture&quot; and seeks to explain when it began.  This is not an issue simply of interest to specialists and students of early American History.  Advocates of a broad Second Amendment right to own guns assert that their position is consistent with the traditions of American society going back to the Revolution.  Bellesiles, Professor of History and director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Emory University in Atlanta, has written an important book for both scholars and general readers, even if ft is clear that Bellesiles was on a mission.  In the provocative introduction, the author asserts that just &quot;[f]ive days before the shootings [at Columbine High School] in Littleton, Colorado, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia agreed with [the] view that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to own machine guns.&quot;  It appears that Bellesiles's admirers and critics are divided along a predictably ideological fault line, but, regardless of one's personal perspective, this book cannot be ignored.   <br />Bellesiles asserts that the Second Amendment must be read in its entirety: &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;  The Second Amendment may stand for the proposition that Americans have an absolute right to own guns.  Or it could mean: Official state militias are necessary to national security, so the right of these militias to own guns is absolute.  The interpretation of these 27 words is crucial.  If the former is correct, federal and state legislation restricting the purchase and ownership of firearms are unconstitutional.  Bellesiles appears to believe, however, that the Second Amendment does not create constitutional limitations on the power of federal, state, or localgovernments to restrict the ownership of guns by individuals.  <br />To understand the intent of the framers of the Constitution and the meaning of the Second Amendment, Bellesiles devotes a few pages Shays's Rebellion, the armed insurrection by farmers in western Massachusetts in 1786-87, which the author asserts to have been &quot;one of several key factors responsible for the calling of the Constitutional Government in Philadelphia in 1787.&quot;  As Bellesiles explains, Shays never had more than a couple of thousand supporters, and they were routed in early 1787 with relatively little bloodshed, but the response to the rebellion was fierce.  According to Bellesiles,&quot;[e]ven Samuel Adams, one of America's leading democrats, rejected pardon for the Shaysites: `The man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to die.'&quot; Bellesiles suggests, therefore, that it makes no sense to believe that, in 1791, only four years after the suppression of Shays' Rebellion, the framers of the Constitution enacted the Second Amendment intending to create a right in individual Americans to possess firearms without restriction. <br />I found that part of Bellesiles's thesis relatively convincing.  It does not necessarily follow, however, that gun ownership was not widespread in the colonial era or in the early years of the Republic. In perhaps the most controversial contention in this book, Bellesiles asserts: &quot;The 1850s saw a notable growth in gun production throughout the United States.&quot;  He also writes: &quot;Arms production took off in the Civil War, never to settle back down.&quot;  If Bellesiles is correct that the middle of the 19th century was the seed time of the &quot;national gun culture,&quot; it occurred at least 75 years later than Second Amendment absolutists assert.  But, I believe, that is far from certain, based upon the information Bellesiles presents. <br />I was not surprised that my home state of Connecticut figured prominently in Bellesiles's narrative.  Colt, Remington, and Winchester, some of the great names in the history of the arming of the American west, were Connecticut companies.  I believe that is a metaphor for the entire book.  I find it very interesting that the small towns of Connecticut, which exemplify New England quietude, have long coexisted with the state's urban manufacturing complexes such as Groton, where a large part of the United States's fleet of nuclear submarines was built; Stratford, where military helicopters are built; and East Hartford, which is a center for the production of jet engines.  This does not mean that the people of Connecticut are more prone to violence than the citizens of other states.  Connecticut has long been the source of technological innovation, and it is not surprising that some of that innovative instinct was devoted to firearms.  According to Bellesiles: &quot;By the end of the Civil War, American-made guns were sturdier, more accurate, and much easier to use than they ever had been.&quot;  This suggests less a national gun culture than a national culture dedicated to excellence in the practical requirements of advanced industrial capitalism.   <br />Bellesiles's book may be in service of a good idea because it seeks to be an antidote to the contemporary gun lobby's insistence that Second Amendment absolutists stand in the shoes of the revolutionary-founding generation.  However, this book ultimately disappoints.  The problems of epidemic violence in general, and that made with guns in particular, in American society cannot be solved by historical argument.  Bellesiles simply fails to demonstrate why it makes any difference whether the United States's national gun culture is 150 or 300 years old. This book is fascinating, so I would not hesitate to recommend it, but I doubt that it will change any reader's mind about the important issues it addresses.	2000-11-26

This book by Martin Berger, who teaches Art History and English at the State University of New York, Buffalo, seeks to place Eakins's work within the cultural context of the &quot;Gilded Age,&quot; an era which many social historians believe to have been characterized by a &quot;crisis in manhood,&quot; so I approached this book with great anticipation.  The text, which includes a number of illustrations, is only 123 pages long, and this is one book in which more might, indeed, have been more.<br />In the introduction, Berger wisely informs the reader that this book is &quot;neither a biography nor a standard art historical study.&quot;  It is, instead a &quot;cultural art history&quot; which explores &quot;Eakins's art in fashioning manhood for both the painter and his white, middle class contemporaries.&quot;  According to Berger, Eakins's paintings &quot;do not merely reflect cultural concerns, but are engaged in both legitimating and forming conceptions of Victorian manhood.&quot;  This is intriguing because, Berger writes, &quot;Eakins's images of men&quot; are &quot;characterized by physical activity, mental engagement, and nudity.&quot;  Assuming that there is some broader cultural significance to these images, what do they tell us about late-19th century American society?  In Berger's view: &quot;On the simplest level, Eakins's athletic canvases offer symbolic reassurance by linking the artist to a series of unimpeachably masculine characters and professions.&quot;  Berger explains that &quot;the manliness of Eakins's athletes was a function not simply of their participation in sports, but also of their success, modernity, and `whiteness.'&quot;<br />According to Berger, &quot;most critics faulted Eakins's monumental Gross Clinic of 1875...for the violence of its realism.&quot;  Berger observes,however, that, after 1900, &quot;critics began consistently to interpret the artist's bluntness as a strength.&quot;  What purpose was served by Eakins's severe realism?  Berger writes: &quot;In the aftermath of the Civil War, questions of gendered identity gained ascendance as white, middle-class men struggled against sweeping national transformations.&quot;  Berger explains that, in the 19th century, and especially during the great and radical economic changes after the Civil War, &quot;middle-class men &quot;took their social identity largely from their success or failure at work.&quot;  Eakins's paintings of men at work (and play) were efforts to provide insights into their social identities.  In The Champion, Single Sculls, according to Berger, Eakins seeks to convey the fact that competitive rowing's development was encouraged by the industrial revolution, and this explains why the sculler is depicted against a background containing railroad bridges, a train, and a steamboat.   In The Biglin Brothers Turning the Stake Boat, according to Berger, &quot;Eakins &quot;points to rowing's reliance on both physical and mental skills.&quot;  Berger concludes his chapter entitled &quot;Manly Associations&quot; by writing: &quot;By judiciously negotiating a path through the conflicted demands of Gilded Age masculinity, [Eakins] offered images of athletes that reassured middle-class American men about their masculine identities.&quot; <br />Eakins completed only 14 canvases depicting nudes or scantily-clad figures, but, according to Berger, &quot;it is for his depiction of naked men that the artist is most frequently remembered today.&quot;  In fact, Berger writes, &quot;[w]hile Victorian critics could endure the exposed buttocks of the male patient in Eakins's portrayal of the Gross Clinic,...many were profoundly disturbed by his depiction of Christ's body in The Crucifixion in 1880,&quot; in which Jesus wears only a small cloth tied around his waist.  According to Berger: &quot;By illustrating nudes without narrative excuses, the painter's canvases make the case for the value of nudes in their own right.&quot;  The best example of this, according to Berger is The Swimming Hole, which shows six naked men relaxing on a stone pier and cavorting in the surrounding water.  According to Berger, in this painting &quot;Eakins points subtly to the recreation available to men of the middle class,&quot;who were permitted by the &quot;solidifying industrial economy of late-nineteenth-century America...to acquire great wealth and so maximize their available time for play.&quot;  In Berger's view: &quot;Swimming offered a practical model for daily life.  (Berger notes that the scenes depicted by Eakins's often were intensely personal, and, in several of his paintings, Eakins included a small self-portrait.)  Furthermore Berger also analyzes at length Eakins's boxing painting Salutat, in which a victorious boxer, shown from the rear, wearing only what we might, today, call a thong, &quot;salutes the cheering crowd.&quot;  According to Berger, this painting &quot;visualizes the economic ties between an athlete and his patrons.&quot;  In addition, Berger asserts that this painting recalls others by Eakins in which &quot;nude figures strike poses for male onlookers who clearly value their physicality.&quot;         Berger offers some fascinating and revealing insights into Eakins's artistic process: &quot;Throughout Eakins's career, the vast majority of his paintings were preceded by fastidious preparatory drawings in which the artist would construct a horizontal grid, on which he plotted every detail of the final work.&quot;  In Berger's view: &quot;Eakins's working process embodied his scientific credentials...[and] helped shore up his masculine position by permitting him an unprecedented degree of control.&quot;  Furthermore, according to the author, &quot;Eakins made himself seem more masculine by associating himself with virile athletes and scientific craftsmen and by employing a working process with positive links to science.&quot;  <br />It is too easy to dismiss Eakins's paintings, especially the male nudes, as erotica intended to push the envelope to the limit of the artist's day.  Although Eakins frequently depicts a world which is homosocial, it is unlikely he sought only to stimulate male viewers.  Berger emphasizes, for instance, that Salutat was shown at the annual exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where &quot;Eakins's canvas offered women an apparent window into the lives of their male contemporaries.&quot;  And that, by analogy, clearly is Berger's main premise: The paintings of Thomas Eakins allow us, at the beginning of the 21st century, to look into the construction of white, middle-class American manhood at the end of the 19th.	2000-11-18

Nevertheless, this is one of the best books I have read in recent years.  According to Author George Chauncey, who teaches at the University of Chicago, a &quot;myth of isolation&quot; &quot;holds that, even if a gay world existed [in New York between 1890 and 1940], it was kept invisible.&quot;  Chauncey's main premise is that, not only was there a gay New York beginning in the 1890s, it was not invisible. <br /> In the marvelous introduction, Chauncey also makes the profound point that the gay male world of the pre-World War II era &quot;was not a world in which men were divided into `homosexuals' and 'heterosexuals.'&quot;  Chauncey proceeds to explain: &quot;This book argues that in important respects the hetero-homosexual binarism, the sexual regime now hegemonic in American culture, is a stunningly recent creation.&quot;  Later in the introduction, Chauncey writes: &quot;Heterosexuality, no less than homosexuality, is a historically specific social category and identity.&quot;   Chauncey's study begins in the 1890s, &quot;a time when New York was famous for being a `wide-open town,' [when] some clubs went so far as to stage live sexual performances.&quot;   The so-called &quot;Bowery resorts were only the most famous elements of an extensive, organized, highly visible gay world.&quot; At the turn of the century, men who were &quot;`painted and powdered,' used women's names, and displayed feminine mannerisms&quot; were called &quot;fairies.&quot;  According to Chauncey, fairies were tolerated, but not respected, in much of working-class society.  During this period &quot;Many men alternated between male and female sexual partners without believing that interest in one precluded interest in the other.&quot;  Men, who &quot;maintained a masculine demeanor and played...only the `masculine,' or insertive role in the sexual encounter&quot; were not considered to be &quot;queer.&quot;  According to Chauncey: &quot;many workingmen knew precisely were to go to find fairies with whom, if they chose, they need not exchange a word to make their wishes clear.&quot;  Chauncey explains: &quot;Most commonly, gay men simply offered to perform certain sexual acts, especially fellation, which many straight men enjoyed but many women (even many prostitutes) were loath to perform.&quot;  If the sexual landscape was fluid in turn-of-the-century working-class New York, a more rigid adherence to the regime of heterosexuality was emerging in middle-class culture.  By the 1920s, according to Chauncey, &quot;the style of the fairy was more likely to be adopted by younger men and poorer men who had relatively little at stake in the straight middle-class world, where the loss of respect the fairy style entailed could be costly indeed.&quot;  Chauncey explains that, in the first two decades of the 20th century, &quot;heterosexuality became more important to middle-class than working-class men&quot; because of the growing belief that &quot;anyone who engaged in homosexual activity was implicated as `being' a homosexual.&quot;  In Chauncey's view: &quot;The insistence on exclusive heterosexuality emerged in part...in response to the [late-19th, early-20th century] crisis in middle-class masculinity....Middle-class men increasingly conceived of their sexuality - their heterosexuality, or exclusive desire for women - as one of the hallmarks of real men.&quot;  According to Chauncey: &quot;The association of the homosexual and the heterosexual with middle-class culture highlights the degree to which `sexuality' and the rooting of gender in anatomy were bourgeois productions,&quot; which explains why Chauncey asserts that the rigid heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy is a recent creation.  This is historical exposition and analysis at its very best<br />     Middle-class sensibilities also were at the center of efforts, beginning early in the 20th century, to police, if not suppress, the &quot;city of bachelors.&quot;  According to Chauncey: &quot;The city was a logical destination for men intent on freeing themselves from the constraints of the family.&quot;  In turn, according to Chauncey, middle-class reformers demonstrated a growing anxiety about the threat to the social order posed by men and women who seemed to stand outside the family.&quot;   According to Chauncey, &quot;World War I was a watershed in the history of the urban moral reform movement&quot; because the war &quot;embodied reformers' darkest fears and their greatest hopes, for it threatened the very foundations of the nation's moral order - the family, small-town stability, the racial and gender hierarchy.&quot;   The streets of New York &quot;were filled with soldiers and sailors,&quot; as a result of which, according to Chauncey, the war &quot;threatened to expose hundreds  of thousands of American boys from farms and small towns to the evil influences of the big city.&quot;   Furthermore, as Chauncey puts it, although &quot;[i]t is impossible to determine how many gay soldiers stayed in New York after the war,...it was, indeed, hard to keep them down on the farm after they've seen gay New York.&quot;   <br />     There is much else about this book to admire.  After Chauncey defines the boundaries of his study, he devotes several chapters to describing in fascinating detail the gay male world in New York between 1890 and 1940, from YMCAs and rooming houses to saloons and gay bars to the baths to assignation hotels.  I am simply in awe of the research Chauncey did for his chapter entitled &quot;`Privacy Could Only Be Had in Public': Forging a Gay World in the Streets,&quot; the sources for which include not only the predictable secondary materials but also letters, interviews, oral histories, and court files in the New York Municipal Archives. There also is a fine selection of photographs, cartoons, and other visual aids.   <br />     The gay world in New York was tolerated by middle-class authorities as long as it did not spread to middle America or to threaten its values.  During World War I, when thousands of young Americans in the military visited the city, the relatively open gay life there threatened to corrupt them, and that contributed to the creation of what Chauncey calls &quot;police-state conditions,&quot; which evolved until they had firmly taken hold by 1940.  I understand Chauncey currently is writing the history of gay New York from 1945 until 1975, and I await publication of that volume with great impatience.	2000-11-17

Kennedy as Cold Warrior: One Crisis After Another&quot;	This book about John F. Kennedy's foreign policy focuses on the United States' confrontation with the Soviet Union over Berlin 1961, the nearly cataclysmic events in Cuba, and the deepening U.S. involvement in Indochina, which culminated in the overthrow and murder of the prime minister of South Vietnam just weeks before President Kennedy, himself, was assassinated.  Is it appropriate to emphasize &quot;wars&quot; in a book about foreign policy? The answer, of course, is: Yes.  Author Lawrence Freedman, one of Britain's leading authorities on the Cold War, does not expressly invoke Clausewitz's famous dictum that war is the continuation of politics by other means, but every reader knows that diplomacy and military power often are inextricably linked.  On few occasions in American history has this been more true than during the &quot;High&quot; Cold War, the dangerous period between the first Berlin crisis in 1948 and the Cuba missile crisis in 1962.  Freedman's fascinating, if occasionally frustrating book, examines the relationship between foreign and military policy at a time when U.S. and the Soviet Union confronted each other, directly or through surrogates, in venues throughout the world, several of which could have, by a single miscalculation, led to nuclear Armageddon.  <br />If John Kennedy genuinely deserves of the judgment of history as great, it is because of the remarkably cool judgment during the missile crisis.  According to Freedman, Kennedy followed this advice in a book written by British military historian and strategist Basil Liddell Hart, which Kennedy reviewed shortly before his election: &quot;Never corner an opponent, and always assist him to save his face.&quot;  The Soviet Union may have been foolish, if not reckless, to send nuclear missiles to Cuba, but, once they were there, the only way Nikita Khrushchev could remove them was through a political bargain which allowed his country to avoid international humiliation.  If Kennedy had not allowed Khrushchev to save face, some sort of military confrontation, if not general nuclear war, would have been inevitable.  Kennedy's decision not to take the advice of his more hawkish advisers was one of the great profiles in courage in the history of the American presidency.    <br />Kennedy defused the Berlin and Cuban crisis, but the war in Vietnam was well on its way to disaster when Kennedy died.  Would anything have changed if he had lived?  It is, to be sure, impossible to say.  Shortly before he was assassinated, President Kennedy met with George Ball, a senior State Department official, to discuss Vietnam.  When Ball spoke of the possibility of a war involving 300,000 American troops and lasting five years, Freedman reports that Kennedy reacted with &quot;asperity,&quot; stating: &quot;George, I always thought you were one of the brightest guys in town, but you're just crazier than hell.  That just isn't going to happen.&quot;  Freedman notes that Ball was uncertain whether the president was &quot;making a prediction that events would not follow this line or that he would not let such a situation develop.&quot;  In any event, we now know that George Ball was, indeed, one of Washington's most astute policy-makers, that Kennedy's assassination prevented him from determining the course of American policy in southeast Asia, and that the American commitment in Vietnam reached a peak of over 500,000 troops and lasted nearly 12 years before it ended in failure.  <br />I admire Freedman's cogent presentation of the Kennedy-era military crises in just over 400 pages.  That includes a brief, but most welcomed, digression into the rift between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the early 1960s.  The relaxation of the United States' confrontation with the Soviet Union during the Kennedy administration simply cannot be understood without reference to Sino-Soviet relations.  I must candidly concede that, if Freedman had pursued other, similar digressions, the text would have approached 600 pages, and I then would be critical of its length. Nevertheless, I disagree with some of his choices.  Every book must begin somewhere and the introduction to this one starts with a short summary of Kennedy family history.  Most readers are familiar with the most salient points: The overbearing Joseph P. Kennedy was almost pathologically ambitious for his sons; after the eldest, Joseph, Jr., was killed in combat during World War II, the mantle fell to John, who had spent his early manhood as a playboy; after the war, JFK was elected first to the House of Representatives and then to the Senate but distinguished himself in neither body and was generally dismissed as a handsome, glib lightweight.  Instead of rehashing that, Freedman should have devoted more space to Kennedy's role in the &quot;missile gap&quot; controversy of the late 1950s.  It was one of the issues which brought Kennedy to national prominence, and it is significant for the fact that, by the time Kennedy was elected in November 1960, if any missile gap existed, it favored the United States.  Consider this scenario: Within weeks of taking office, several of President Kennedy's key aides, principally National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara realized that the U.S. was superior to the Soviet Union in the missile race; having lost the missile gap as an issue, but under pressure to make good on Kennedy's campaign promise to increase defense spending, the administration decided to take a more aggressive stance elsewhere.  The Soviet Union clearly provoked the 1961 Berlin crisis, but &quot;Kennedy's wars&quot; in Cuba and southeast Asia resulted from the new administration's deliberate effort to confront the international Communist menace wherever they found it. <br /> I doubt that Kennedy's Wars will change many minds about John Kennedy's legacy.  His partisans will continue to view Kennedy's unexpected and untimely death as one of the great lost opportunities of the 20th century.  Critics will find in this book further ammunition for their position that Kennedy must be judged by what he did and based on his charisma and soaring rhetoric.  Nevertheless, this book must be read by anyone who wants to understand why the 1000-day Camelot era was one military crisis after another.	2000-11-08

According to Zhai, the Vietnamese &quot;had a tradition of looking to China for models and inspirations,&quot; but there also were &quot;historical animosities between the two countries as a result of China's interventions in Vietnam.&quot;  Zhai writes that Mao Zedong was &quot;eager to aid Ho Chi Minh in 1950&quot; because Mao believed &quot;Indochina constituted one of the three fronts (the others being Korea and Taiwan) that Mao perceived as vulnerable to an invasion by imperialist countries headed by the United States.&quot;  When the Viet Minh army headed toward the decisive battle at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, they were accompanied by a Chinese &quot;general military adviser,&quot; and China furnished the PAVN with antiaircraft guns, as well as engineering experts and large quantities of ammunition.  The Viet Minh won the battle but were bitterly disappointed by the peacewhich followed.  According to Zhai, China's approach to the Geneva conference was motivated by fear of the United States' designs in Indochina:  &quot;To prevent American intervention, [Zhou Enlai] was ready to compromise of the Laotian and Cambodian issue,&quot; and he formally proposed &quot;withdrawal of the Viet Minh troops from Laos and Cambodia.&quot;  Zhai writes: &quot;For the Vietnamese Communists, the Geneva Conference served as a lesson about the nature and limits of Communist internationalism,&quot; and both Beijing and Moscow pressured the Viet Minh &quot;to abandon its efforts to unify the whole of Vietnam.&quot;  <br />Zhai makes the controversial assertion that, in 1961, President Kennedy &quot;set out to increase U.S. commitment to the Saigon regime.&quot;  In response, according to Zhai, Mao Zedong &quot;expressed a general support for the armed struggle of the South Vietnamese people,&quot; but China's leaders &quot;were uneasy about their Vietnamese comrades' tendency to conduct large-unit operations in the south.&quot;  Zhai writes: &quot;The period between 1961 and 1964 was a crucial one in the evolution of Sino-DRV relations....Its urgent need to resist American pressure increased its reliance on China's material assistance.&quot;  According to Zhai: &quot;The newly available Chinese documents clearly indicate that Beijing provided extensive support (short of volunteer pilots) to Hanoi during the Vietnam War and in doing so risked war with the United States.&quot;  In Zhai's view, although Chinese leaders were &quot;determined to avoid war with the United States,&quot; Beijing warned that &quot;if the United States bombs China[,] that would mean war and there would be no limits to the war.&quot; According to Zhai: &quot;Between 1965 and 1968, Beijing strongly opposed peace talks between Hanoi and Washington and rejected a number of international initiatives designed to promote a peaceful solution to the Vietnam conflict.&quot;  &quot;Above all, Mao and his associates wanted the North Vietnamese to wage a protracted war to tie down the United States in Vietnam.&quot;  When the Paris negotiations began in May 1968, Beijing was &quot;unenthusiastic.&quot;   In less than three years, the international situation changed.  Zhai's lengthy discussion of the complicated internal and international events leading up to the crisis in Cambodia in 1970 is a case study in Machiavellian politics and diplomacy.  By 1971, according to Zhai, Chinese leaders were &quot;keen to see an early conclusion of the Vietnam War in order to preserve American power and contain Soviet influence.&quot;  After President Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972, according to Zhai, the North Vietnamese &quot;drew a bitter lesson from Nixon's handshake with Mao that China's foreign policy was concerned less with Communist unity than with the pursuit of China's national interest.&quot;  In Zhai';s view: &quot;Nixon's decision to normalize relations with Beijing nullified the hitherto basic rationale of the Vietnam War, namely to contain and isolate Communist China.&quot;  According to Zhai: &quot;Mao and Zhou Enlai viewed with satisfaction the conclusion of the Paris Peace Agreement.&quot;  In September 1975, just a few months after Saigon fell and Vietnam was unified, Zhai writes that Mao told a Vietnamese visitor, in effect, &quot;Hanoi should stop looking to China for assistance.&quot;  &quot;The long historical conflict between China and Vietnam...had returned to life.&quot;       <br />In conclusion, Zhai asserts that &quot;[t]here were two strands in China's policy toward Vietnam during the two Indochina wars: cooperation and containment;&quot; &quot;From the 1950s to 1968, the cooperation side of China's policy was predominant; and &quot;From the late 1960s, particularly between 1972 and 1975, the containment side of China's policy became more prominent.&quot;  In my opinion, the most important aspects of this book is its demonstrationthat international Communism was not monolithic in the 1960s and 1970s.  Zhai makes clear that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China encouraged and aided Vietnam's struggle for independence from France and its war for national unification against the United States, but the Communist powers were motivated more by national interests than by revolutionary solidarity.  The history of Chinese-Vietnamese relations between 1950 and 1975 must be viewed within the broader contexts of growing Sino-Soviet competition for primacy in the international Communist movement and of China's eventual, if only limited, rapprochement with the United States.  Zhai's book is, therefore, an important contribution to the literature about the most controversial foreign war in American history.	2000-10-08
US	50862643	R30KNIFWK21PIP	0195124820	504328193	The Better Angel: Walt Whitman in the Civil War	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Great Poet, Great Soul of the Civil War	The magnificent Civil War-era poet Walt Whitman is well served by this fascinating study by Roy Morris, Jr., of Whitman's experiences during the  war. At the beginning of this book, Morris observes that Whitman considered  his work during the conflict, visiting thousands of wounded and ill  soldiers at hospitals in and surrounding Washington, D.C., &quot;the  greatest privilege and satisfaction&quot; of his life. As a result, this  period in the colorful poet's colorful life deserves much more attention  than it has previously received.  As much as I enjoyed this book, I  fundamentally disagree with this point by Morris: &quot;Of the comparative  handful of American writers who personally witnessed the Civil War, Whitman  was the unlikeliest candidate to become its recorder. Not only was he  nearly forty-two years old when the war began, but he also was a poet, a  philosopher, a freethinker, a mystic, a near Quaker, and a  homosexual.&quot; For precisely those reasons, Whitman was the ideal  chronicler of the greatest and most tragic crisis in American history. As  an outsider, Whitman was able to view the war with detachment, criticizing  Northern politicians and generals when necessary but invariably sympathetic  to the young men on both sides who did the actual fighting, suffering, and  dying. <br />According to Morris, Whitman may or may not have been intimate  with the numerous young men whom he named and described in his Civil War  notebooks, but: &quot;For all the breadth and variety of his friendships,  Whitman was essentially a lonely man.&quot; In mid-December 1862, a few  days after the Union Army of the Potomac's horrendous defeat in a battle at  Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman read a newspaper report that his brother  George was a casualty of combat. Walt left New York almost immediately for  Washington, where, after an exhausting three-day trip, &quot;he trudged  dispiritedly from hospital to hospital, hoping to find his wounded  brother.&quot; Whitman eventually located George, who had already returned  to duty as an officer, and then spent several days, recording impressions  in his notebook. According to Morris, Whitman also began &quot;to write  poems that spoke in the drawling voices of the men themselves, in accents  he first heard around the campfires at Fredericksburg.&quot; Except for a  few brief sojourns to New York, he stayed in the capital until the end of  the war. He took a modest-paying government job to support himself, but  Morris reports: &quot;Visiting the hospitals quickly became the focal point  of Whitman's day.&quot; According to Morris: &quot;At the end of 1862 there  were approximately thirty-five hospitals in and around Washington,  accommodating some thirteen thousand suffering soldiers.&quot; Morris then  provides a fascinating digression into the state of American medical  science in the early 1860s, which, according to Morris, &quot;was not much  advanced from the Middle Ages,&quot; and it is ugly. What is more important  for our purposes, in Morris's words, is that Whitman &quot;found the  hospitals - and the handsome young men within them - surprisingly fertile  ground for his art.&quot; In February 1863, Whitman's article about the  hospitals in Washington, entitled &quot;The Great Army of the Sick,&quot;  appeared in The New York Times, and, a few weeks later, the Brooklyn Daily  Eagle printed Whitman's article &quot;Life Among Fifty Thousand  Soldiers.&quot; Whitman continued to visit hospitals and to write about his  experiences for the next three years.<br />Some of Morris's brief vignettes of  Whitman's ministry eloquently capture the essence of the poet. At one  point, for instance, &quot;Whitman suffered a temporary crisis of  faith.&quot; Morris explains: &quot;He betrayed the strain on his emotions  in a heated conversation with Unitarian minister William Henry  Channing....Pacing the floor and wringing his hands, Whitman suddenly  exclaimed: &quot;I say stop this war,this horrible massacre of men.&quot;  And Morris writes: &quot;Sitting in the dark in the hospital ward, holding  the hand of a dying young man, he is at once doctor and nurse, mother and  father, friend and lover, angel and Death.&quot; But it is Whitman's  writing that attracts our greatest attention. After watching a train of  wagons carrying the wounded enter Washington, Whitman wrote: &quot;This is  the way men come in now, seldom in small numbers, but always in these long,  sad processions.&quot; Whitman later produced an eyewitness account of the  victorious Union armies' massive Grand Review through Washington on May 23  and 24, 1885, and the triumphant atmosphere starkly contrasted with the  parades of ambulances entering the city Whitman had observed on several  occasions. Whitman wrote that it was &quot;too impressive to be  described,&quot; and &quot;the rank &amp; file was the greatest sight of  all.&quot; If Whitman thought that the Civil War brought out the best in  American society, he also believed that the Gilded Age which followed  brought out the worst: &quot;The depravity of the business classes of our  country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater....The  best class we show, is but a mob of fashionably dress'd speculators and  vulgarians.&quot; <br />Whitman once predicted that &quot;the real war will  never get in the books,&quot; but it did, and Whitman, himself,is an  important source. According to Morris, Whitman &quot;ended the war as 'the  Good Gray Poet,'(the title of a tribute to his Civil War service published  in 1866), a beloved, almost mystical figure who personally embodied for  millions of Americans a democratic ideal of sharing and brotherhood that  remains undimmed nearly a century and a half later.&quot; From the cover, a  reproduction of a photograph of Whitman with long hair and a full beard  which makes him look like an Old Testament prophet, to the final page, this  book is splendid and should appeal equally to admirers of Whitman's art and  to the multitude of Civil War enthusiasts. Whitman was not merely the war's  greatest poet; as Morris ably demonstrates, he also was one of its greatest  souls.	2000-09-20

Nevertheless, Gergen worked  for Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton, as well as on President  Bush's campaign, and with President Carter after he left office. As a  result, Gergen has had the opportunity to know every chief executive of the  United States since1969, and he must have some insights into the essential  elements of presidential leadership.  At least that is what I expected.<br />What I am about to do is a bit unfair because I am taking Gergen's words  out of context, but here are a few examples of Gergen's less-than-incisive  observations: &quot;Like so much else in the Nixon operation, the zeal to  win, to control every detail, to make the trains run on time, went  completely overboard;&quot; &quot;Jerry Ford had a mind of his own about  what he wanted;&quot; &quot;There was a continual jockeying for power and  for Reagan's ear;&quot; and &quot;Clinton had slipped on one banana peel  after another.&quot;  Gergen is one of the current crop of journalists who  have raised political punditry to an art form.  He is not Walter Lippmann,  but neither is Gergen, a graduate of Harvard Law School, an ink-stained  wretch or a hack.  And that is why I expected more from him.<br />Why does  this book fail to provide depth of insight?  This is what I suspect  happened: The publisher, and perhaps Gergen himself, wanted to get it into  print during the 2000 campaign.  The text covers a lot of ground, and given  the self-imposed deadline pressure, there simply was not time for judicious  rewriting and careful editing.  As a result, a lot of the prose is flabby,  and there is at least one embarrassing gaffe, when Gergen refers to  &quot;Mr. Chips goes to Washington.&quot;  (Film enthusiasts certainly will  recognize &quot;Mr. Chips&quot; as the much-beloved English schoolteacher,  while &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; was the  unsophisticated senator.)  Nevertheless, I believe that this is a good book which has the potential  for greatness.  For instance, about midway through the book, Gergen writes:  &quot;At the heart of leadership is the leader's relationship with  followers.&quot;  That may border on triteness, but I believe it is an  important concept.  If Gergen had carefully examined the leader-follower  relationship for each of the presidents he studies, we might have gained  real insight into how the public decides who will lead and then how the  president goes about leading.  Instead, too much of this book is devoted to  inside-the-Beltway blather.  The descriptive chapters of this book  are, therefore, somewhat disappointing.  The final chapter, entitled  &quot;Seven Lessons of Leadership,&quot; is prescriptive but also less than  persuasive.  For instance, Gergen asserts that &quot;integrity is the most  important [personal attribute] for a president.&quot;  That may be a  valuable principle for a civics class, but I submit that it has little to  do with practical reality.  Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were well known  for their ethical lapses and each got elected president twice.  Jimmy  Carter was a man of high character but a nearly utter failure as president.  And telling us the president must have a &quot;capacity to persuade,&quot;  tells us little we do not already know.  No one can get nominated, let  alone elected, without the power of persuasion, but some presidents are  better preachers from the bully pulpit than others.  The question, of  course is: Why?  For all of his experience in public life, Gergen has not  yet given enough thought to the lessons he can draw from that experience.<br />Sometime before the election of 2004, I urge Gergen to return to his  computer, cut the text by about one-third, but triple the penetrating  analysis.  The result, I predict, would be a genuine contribution to the  popular literature about what it takes to be a leader in the most powerful  elected office in the world.metime before the election of 2004, I urge Gergen to return to his  computer, cut the text by about one-third, but triple the penetrating  analysis.

Approximately the first third of this book is devoted to  the resolution of the Pequots' claims between 1973 and 1983, which  reestablished their presence on an enlarged reservation.  The remainder of  the book is devoted to the Pequots' construction and operation of Foxwoods,  the world's largest casino, with accompanying hotels and resort facilities.   Some readers will find this book the story of the righting of a great  historical injustice.  Others will find it a cautionary tale replete with  greed, double-dealing, and, perhaps, fraud and deception.  From either  perspective, it is hard to put down this book.<br />Several decades ago, the  United States commenced a number on behalf of Indian tribes to regain land  which had been illegally taken from them.  In the 1960s, the basic  requirements for an Indian land claim included requirements that the tribe  remained in existence, that the tribe had not abandoned its territory, and  that the land had been taken from the tribe after 1790 and without approval  of the federal government.  In 1966, Congress imposed a six-year statute of  limitations on these lawsuits, and, in 1972, Congress extended that  deadline for five years.  In March 1975, Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Hayward,  age 26, the eldest grandson of Elizabeth George, who was living in  Maryland, but, according to Benedict, &quot;[h]e had been in and out ofwork since 1969 and steadily unemployed since leaving Connecticut,&quot;  decided to return to, in his own words, &quot;rebuild the  reservation.&quot;   In April, a Maine lawyer specializing in Indian law  met with Hayward and thought: &quot;The Haywards were Caucasians, did not  speak a word of Pequot, were extremely few in number, and lacked the basic  knowledge of the very tribe they claimed to belong to.  None of them lived  on the reservation.  They were without a chief or tribal government.&quot;   Nevertheless, according to Benedict: &quot;Property records confirmed with  certainty that Connecticut had sold off eight hundred acres of Connecticut  land without federal approval&quot; which would give Pequot land claims  merit.  In August, about 20 members of Hayward's family met near the old  Elizabeth George homestead, and, according to Benedict, Hayward explained  to them: &quot;To join the litigation, family members first had to join the  Pequot tribe and start identifying themselves as American Indians.  They  need to come together and start acting like a tribe.  That meant a tribal  constitution had to be drafted, leaders had to be elected, and membership  rolls had to be created, in order to show that the tribe was populated.   Most importantly, the group had to establish residency on the  reservation.&quot;   At the end of the meeting, Hayward introduced a  constitution which the Maine lawyer had drafted naming the organization the  &quot;`Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribe,' being the same organization as  that referred to in Connecticut State Legislation as the `Western Pequot  Tribe' of Connecticut.&quot;  Benedict reports that  &quot;Mashantucket&quot; means &quot;much wooded land, and &quot;oral  tradition held that [the Pequots] referred to themselves as `the Fox  people,'&quot; so they later adopted a logo portraying a fox looking into  the woods as their symbol.  The six-page constitution was ratified by  Hayward and nine other individuals, whothen elected Hayward as the first  &quot;tribal chairman.&quot;   Connecticut law permitted each Indian tribe  in the State, according to Benedict, &quot;to determine wholly  independently who would qualify&quot; as a member of the tribe.  The  Pequots' by-laws &quot;set a standard that admitted individuals who were  `genealogically recorded as a Western Pequot by the State of Connecticut.   Anyone who could trace his or her genealogy to an individual who was  identified as a Pequot Indian on the 1910 census was eligible to pay a  small fee and join the tribe.&quot;  As Benedict reports, a  less-than-vigorous application of that rule later created problems for the  Pequots.  <br />Throughout the book, various opponents outside the tribe  condemn Hayward and his group as imposters, and Benedict's revelations  about Hayward's lineage may be the most controversial aspect of this book.   During an early meeting of the Ledyard landowners sued by the Pequots, one  expressed what appeared to be a consensus view: &quot;I know Skip....He's  no Indian.&quot;  In fact, according to Benedict, Hayward has Indian blood,  but everyone involved appears to have assumed, incorrectly, that, because  Elizabeth George lived on the Pequot reservation, she was a Pequot.  Benedict asserts: &quot;Congress is still empowered to ask for proof of  legitimacy from those claiming to be Pequots.  And if an investigation  determined that the people operating Foxwoods are not really the Pequot  tribe, then Congress has a remedy: Amend the 1983 law and revoke the  group's federal recognition status.&quot;  If that happens, it may be as  disruptive as the original recognition of the Pequots and the events that  followed. <br />This book is a highly-detailed  journalistic treatment of some  fascinating historical, legal, and public policy issues, but I have a  couple of specific criticisms.  First, it inexplicably contains no index,  and, given the complexity of the events, I found that very frustrating.   Second, although the lengthy bibliography demonstrates Benedict  conscientiousness as a reporter, I noticed several factual errors.  To note  just a few: Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, not 1863; Austin  McGuigan served as Connecticut's chief state's attorney, not attorney  general; in civil litigation, plaintiffs do not &quot;accuse&quot;  defendants of anything, they &quot;allege;&quot; and the New England  Patriots' stadium is in &quot;Foxboro,&quot; Massachusetts, not  &quot;Foxborough.&quot;  Those relatively minor points aside, this story is  far from over, and I hope that Benedict will report back to us in due  course.	2000-09-10
US	50862643	R155MU1D7JM7Y	0195074998	239315871	The Devil We Knew: Americans and the Cold War	Books	4	26	30	N	N	The Cold War: Ideology or Simply Competing Interests?	On the final page of this brief, but provocative, rumination about the  United States' Cold War experience, author H.W. Brands, professor of  history at Texas A &amp; M University, presents this paradox: In 1945,  nearly all Americans and probably a majority of interested foreigners had  looked on the United States as a beacon shining the way to a better future  for humanity, one in which ideals mattered more than tanks.  During the  next forty years,American leaders succeeded in convincing many Americans  and all but a few foreigners that the United States could be counted on to  act pretty much as great powers always have.  To the extent that Brands is  correct, the question, of course, is: Why?  This is not merely an  intellectual exercise.  During the Cold War, Brands reminds us: \\"More than  100,000 Americans died fighting wars that had almost nothing to do with  genuine American security.\\"  Practically all of them died in the barren  hills of Korea and the steaming jungles of Vietnam.  The question, again,  is: Why?<br />Brands posits the \\"dual character of the Cold War - being both a  geopolitical and an ideological contest\\" and explains: \\"The ideological  gulf between the United States and the Soviet Union gave the geopolitical  rivalry unprecedented urgency.\\"  In Brands's interpretation, the origins of  the Cold War were partly the dynamics of conventional international  relations: The United States and the Soviet Union emerged from the Second  World War as the only world powers, so, practically by definition, they had  to be rivals.  But, as Brands, observes, geopolitical competition was  intensified by extreme ideological differences.  According to Brands: \\"By  the middle 1950s, the American alliance system girdled the globe\\" and  \\"[a]bout the only thing all the countries in the American system shared was  an avowed opposition to communism.\\"  Sometimes this proved awkward.  Brands  reminds us that \\"Washington could be counted on to praise allies and  clients for their opposition to godless communism, if not for their strict  observance of the human rights and civil liberties of all their subjects.\\"  According to Brands, \\"by allying with repressive regimes, the American  government undercut the popular moral base on which America's containment  policy rested.\\"  The United States' alliances with unsavory right-wing  dictators were prompted by the imperative for national survival.  According  to Brands, \\"[f]or the first time in American history, an enemy [possessed]  the capacity to strike quickly and devastatingly at America's industrial  resources and population.\\"  And Brands writes that after Sputnik's launch:  \\"For the first time in their history, Americans found themselves facing the  specter of national extinction.\\"  But \\"the anti-communist crusade...[also]  served purposes that had little to do with its professed fear for American  security.\\"  In 1963, for instance, during hearings on what became the Civil  Rights Act of 1964, Sen. Strom Thurmond asserted that anti-segregation  parades and demonstrations were \\"inspired by Communists\\" and were \\"part of  the international conspiracy of communism.\\"  Richard Nixon's transformation  from Cold War hardliner to foreign-policy realist is an intriguing  case-study.  Nixon was, of course, an original Cold Warrior ideologue.  But  the 1969 Nixon Doctrine, according to Brands, provided that the \\"United  States...would no longer shoulder the burden of maintaining internal  security for its friends, or of guaranteeing them against local or regional  conflict.\\"  The Nixon Doctrine, Brands writes, represented \\"an intention to  de-ideologize American foreign policy.... Geopolitics not ideology,  henceforth would guide American policy.\\"  That was wishful thinking.  In  1976, a group of hardliners whom Brands describes as \\"detente-distrusters\\"  organized the Committee on the Present Danger which \\"dedicated itself to  waking America to the dangers its members believed America facedfrom  Soviet ambitions - in other words, to reviving the Cold War.\\"<br />The  reason, according to Brands, is that \\"Charles Krauthammer was probably  right when he argued that nations need enemies.\\"  During the Cold War,  Brands writes, \\"America had an enemy that could hardly have been improved  upon.  The Soviet Union was officially atheistic...dictatorial...  socialistic... militarily powerful...ideologically  universalist...obsessively secretive.\\"  This was the devil we knew.  Brands makes this intriguing point: \\"[P]erhaps the most important reason  for detente's demise was that Americans loved the Cold War too much to let  it go.\\"  He suggests, therefore, that the Cold War was perpetuated long  after there ceased to be a credible threat of a U.S.-U.S.S.R. military  confrontation by the sectors of American society which benefitted from the  Cold War: Defense contractors, fellow-traveling proponents of military  Keynesianism, and right-wing ideologues.  According to Brands: \\"Arguably,  the most important effect of the Cold War on American life was the  inspiration it provided for unprecedented spending on defense.\\"  For  instance, Brands writes that \\"the Reagan [defense] buildup worked wonders  for the American defense industry,\\" as defense spending rose between Fiscal  Year 1981 and 1985 from $171 billion to $229 billion.  The administration's  \\"anti-communism...fueled a new round of military Keynesianism.\\" And Brands  quotes New Right activist and fundraiser Richard Viguerie that this orgy of  defense spending was necessitated by the false premise that \\"[c]learly, we  have fallen from being the Number One military power in the world to the  Number Two power, behind a country whose leaders are totally committed to  defeating America and conquering the world.\\"<br />Brands's final chapter is  entitled in part: \\"Who Won the Cold War?&quot;  According to Brands, the  United States enjoyed \\"a brilliant victory....At the end, the Soviet Union  was utterly vanquished.\\"  He concludes that \\"the Cold War was no war at  all, but simply the management of national interests in a world of  competing interests.\\"  However, according to Brands, the American people \\"  have an \\"incurable desire to make the world a better place.\\" In Brands's  view: \\"This save-the-world inclination was largely responsible for the  fervor with which Americans waged the Cold War.\\"  Brands explains: \\"The  staying power of the Cold War paradigm resulted in no small part from its  capacity to combine the selfless with the self-interested.\\"  I would only  substitute \\"confuse\\" for \\"combine.\\"  Others will dispute Brands's premises,  as well as his conclusions.  But I doubt that any thinking reader will fail  to find this book stimulating.aced from  Soviet ambitions - in other words, to reviving the Cold War.\\" <br />The  reason, according to Brands, is that \\"Charles Krauthammer was probably  right when he argued that nations need enemies.\\"  During the Cold War,  Brands writes, \\"America had an enemy that could hardly have been improved  upon.

US	50862643	R70T5V60MKN95	0684846098	975528807	Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869	Books	5	49	58	N	N	The Wonders of Working on the Railroad	Is there a more skillful writer of American narrative history practicing  today than Stephen Ambrose.  Not in my opinion.  In this exceptionally fine  book, Ambrose tells the story of the greatest engineering feat of the 19th  century: the construction of the transcontinental railroad, which connected  Omaha, Nebraska to Sacramento, California.  The Men Who Built the  Transcontinental Railroad (only a couple of female characters figure  prominently in Ambrose's story, although many others played important roles  behind the scenes), included some of the most famous names in the history  of 19th-century politics, business, finance, and industry, as well as tens  of thousands of virtually-anonymous workers who provided millions of  man-hours of sweat equity in this extraordinary project.  This book is  especially compelling because, more than anything else, it is a great human  drama and some of its passages are as poignant as How Green Was My Valley,  Richard Llewellyn's great tale of Welsh coal miners.  However, Ambrose is  painting on a much larger canvas.<br />We all know how the story will end -  the Union Pacific and Central Pacific met at Promontory Summit north of the  Great Salt Lake in Utah on May 10, 1869 - but Ambrose's narrative is given  an urgency by his effective use of newspaper and magazine accounts of the  events which transpired in the 1860s.  Ambrose acknowledges that all of his  research assistants were members of his family, and they are to be  commended.  The technical details about the vast quantities of materials  purchased and the travails involved in transporting them to where they were  needed are fascinating.  In addition, this book's many outstanding features  includes its collection of photographs.  Anyone familiar with Civil War-era  photography will recognize the facial types, but I was amazed by  photographs depicting engineering and construction marvels: bridges,  tunnels, snow sheds, trestles cuts, and a myriad of others.  The ability of  the surveyors, engineers, construction foremen, and workers to overcome  every type of natural obstacle during the course of construction was simply  remarkable, and Ambrose's description of building the Central Pacific  through the Sierra Nevada mountains is thrilling.       Ambrose clearly  was impressed by the enormity of the railroad builders' accomplishments,  but he occasionally offers some wry humor.  The Hell-on-Wheels towns which  sprung up around the railroads' tracks were rough places then but sources  of some amusement now.  And Ambrose makes much of the delightful irony that  Leland Stanford was elected governor of California in 1861 in part because  he aggressively slandered Chinese immigrants as the &quot;dregs of  Asia&quot; and &quot;that degraded race,&quot; but, if it had not been for  the efforts of thousands of Chinese laborers, the Central Pacific portion  of the railroad might never have been finished.  (Equivalent numbers of  Irish workers performed most of the construction on the Union Pacific line  from the east).  According to Ambrose, many of the Chinese were less than  five feet tall and weighed no more than 120 lbs., but they proved to be  ideal workers: industrious, intelligent, and generally uncomplaining.  When  a construction foreman declares &quot;I will not boss Chinese!&quot;, one  of the Central Pacific's directors replies: &quot;They built the Great Wall  of China, didn't they?&quot;  The men who conceived, financed, designed,  and built the railroad are Ambrose's real story, but this book is made  additionally enjoyable by appearances, sometimes extended, sometimes cameo,  by a number of the most famous men of the age, including Presidents,  Lincoln, Johnson, and Grant, Brigham Young, General William T. Sherman, and  Horace Greeley.  There are a few instances where this book could have used  more careful editing.  For instance, Charles Francis Adams is first  identified, incorrectly, as the &quot;grandson of two presidents&quot; and  only later, correctly, as &quot;grandson and great-grandson of U.S.  presidents.&quot;  And we probably only needed to read once that the wife  of the Central Pacific construction boss accompanied her husband throughout  the project, living in a passenger car from which she hung a caged canary  around her entrance.  But I consider these to be very minor defects.<br />With  the possible exception of the 1780s and the 1940s, no decade in American  history was more exciting than the 1860s.  It included a successful  resolution of the greatest crisis in American history, the Civil War, and  the extension of the transportation infrastructure from the Atlantic to the  Pacific.  Railroad construction was the largest industry of its time, and  the completion of the transcontinental railroad (and the telegraph line  built alongside it) was an indispensable precursor to American greatness.   By 1900, in large part as a result of its extensive system of internal  transportation, the United States was the strongest economic power in the  world.  <br />Less than a week after it was released, Stephen Ambrose's  Nothing Like It in the World is already well on its way to becoming a  national bestseller, and its success could not be more richly well  deserved.  I do not remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.	2000-09-04

Her  memoir of planter-society life, published in 1863 as Journal of a Residence  on a Georgia Plantation, provided, according to Author Catherine Clinton,  &quot;a disquieting glimpse into the world the slaveholders made.&quot;   Clinton holds the Ph.D. in history from Princeton University, and she has  taught at several colleges and universities including Brandeis, Brown, and  Harvard.  She is widely regarded as one of the preeminent historians of the  antebellum south and of American women in the 19th century, and her  expertise and erudition come through on every page of this fascinating  book.  In the interest of fairness, I must disclose that Clinton and I were  college classmates, and I took several courses with her.  She was a  brilliant student, and her success as a professional historian was  predestined.<br />Kemble belonged to a family of prominent British  Shakespearean actors, and her earliest fame came as the title heroine in  Romeo and Julie and in performances in other classics in London beginning  in 1829, when she was only 19.  In 1832, she arrived in the United States  for a two-year theatrical tour. We are, however, primarily interested in  Kemble's life after her 1834  marriage to Pierce Butler, who inherited the  plantations on Georgia's Sea Islands in 1836.  Kemble and Butler lived for  their first years together in Philadelphia, but Butler tenaciously held  onto extreme social attitudes.  In Southern antebellum culture, according  to Clinton, &quot;the white male patriarch ruled unchallenged, and  &quot;Fanny could best demonstrate her loyalty, Butler maintained, by  agreeing with him in every regard.&quot;  That was virtually impossible for  the spirited Kemble, who found her husband to be &quot;rude and  unkind&quot; and his mental faculties &quot;lackluster.&quot;  In contrast,  the portraits of Kemble in this book show her to be a woman of obvious  intelligence and seriousness of purpose.  The Butler-Kemble union failed  from the beginning and, in 1835, according to Clinton, Kemble expressed  willingness to give Butler custody of their infant daughter if he would  allow her to leave.  Butler rejected the idea, and Kemble remained  miserable until their divorce in 1849.  <br />From an early age, Kemble had  imagined herself to be a &quot;literary lioness,&quot; and, in despair, she  turned to writing.  In the spring of 1835, Kemble wrote a &quot;long and  vehement treatise against negro slavery.&quot;  According to Clinton,  Kemble was &quot;[a]lways given to social commentary with a theatrical  flair.&quot; Clinton observes that &quot;Kemble's vivid writings [are]  replete with insights on women's rights, slavery, and race,&quot; and they  offer valuable insights into the realities of plantation life.   But  Clinton notes that &quot;[a]s Mrs. Pierce Butler, the wife of the second  largest slaveholder in Georgia,&quot; Kemble &quot;found herself in a  precarious position.&quot;  The peculiar institution afforded her a life of  leisure, but, according to Clinton, she &quot;found herself increasingly  drawn to the plight of the slaves.&quot;  After arriving in Georgia in  1838, Kemble established a slave hospital and a slave nursery, and, in  defiance of state law, she taught the alphabet to a bright slave.  It was  not until 1863, however, that Kemble consented to the publication of  Journal of a Residence on a Georgia Plantation, which Clinton describes as  &quot;the vivid and haunting diatribe against human bondage composed during  her stay on the Butler plantations in the winter of 1838-39.&quot;   According to Clinton: &quot;Fanny Kemble...characterized Butler as a  despot; Butler's friends portrayed him as a peerless master.  The truth lay  somewhere in between.&quot;  A review in the Atlantic Monthly called  Kemble's Journal &quot;the first ample, lucid, faithful, detailed account,  from the actual head-quarters of a slave plantation in this country, of the  workings of the system.&quot;  Horace Greeley's Tribune also had high  praise for Kemble's Journal.  But Kemble's younger daughter, who supported  the Confederate States during the Civil War, wrote in 1881 that  &quot;nothing would ever induce me to have [the Georgia Journal] in my  house....I never can forgive it.&quot;  According to Clinton: &quot;One  intimate of both women complained that Fanny Kemble thought all the South's  problems stemmed from slavery, while [the younger daughter] believed all  the problems of the South were created by African Americans.&quot;  Clinton  remarks that &quot;the book has more greatly influenced twentieth-century  historians than Civil War-era politicians,&quot; and she notes that,  beginning in the 1950s, slavery scholars began citing Kemble as an  authority.<br />Clinton makes extensive use of Kemble's memoirs and  correspondence, but I was a bit surprised that Clinton did not quote more  extensively from the Georgia Journal in this book. Clinton may have hoped  to inspire readers to delve more deeply into Kemble's impressive oeuvre in  the original, including Fanny Kemble's Journals, edited by Clinton and  published earlier this year by Harvard University Press.  That book offers  selections from Kemble's 11 volumes of autobiographical writings and is, I  suspect, fascinating.  I do not understand precisely why this book is  subtitled &quot;The Story of America's Most Unlikely Abolitionist.&quot;   Early in the book, Clinton writes that Kemble developed a &quot;renowned  affinity for `plain folk,' and she clearly had a gift for social  commentary.  So, her marriage to a wealthy planter notwithstanding, I do  not find it surprising that Kemble took a public position on the most  serious question in mid-19th century America.  But I consider this point a  quibble: Despite the subtitle, this book is wonderful.  Although generally  devoted to significant political and social questions, cameo appearances by  Kemble's circle of noteworthy friends and acquaintances, including  Washington Irving, Louis Agassiz, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth  Longfellow, and Henry James, make it fun as well. So does the fact that  Kemble's elder daughter married a Pennsylvania physician in 1859, and their  son, Owen Wister, Jr., achieved fame in his own right as the author of the  novel The Virginian and the commentary for a famous volume of illustrations  of Frederic Remington.  This biography details a remarkable 19th-century  life.  I recommend Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars and everything else written by  Catherine Clinton without qualification.	2000-08-31

Corber explains that &quot;the successful  negotiation of the corporate hierarchy depended less on personal ambition  and personal initiative than on respect for authority, loyalty to one's  superiors, and the ability to get along with others - all qualities  traditionally associated with femininity.&quot; <br />Corber first provides a  lengthy, incisive discussion of film noir, the genre of gritty detective  stories popular in this era. According to Corber: &quot;Inspired by the  hard-boiled detective novels of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James  M. Cain, and Cornell Woolrich,&quot;  film noir presented a  &quot;pessimistic view of American society.&quot;  In particular interest,  according to Corber &quot;postwar film in general tended to ratify the  homophobic categories of Cold War political discourse.  The discources of  national security tried to exploit fears that there was no way to tell  homosexuals from heterosexuals.&quot;  Corber explains: &quot;The  possibility that gay men could escape detection by passing as straight  linked them in the Cold War political imaginary to the Communists who were  allegedly conspiring to overthrow the government.&quot;  As a result, in  Corber's view: &quot;The unusual presence in film noir of characters who  are explicitly identified as gay can be attributed to male homosexual  panic.&quot;  The early-Cold War popularity of film noir, according to  Corber, indicates that the Americanpublic accepted the genre's sexual  politics.  According to Corber, &quot;the hard-boiled detective's refusal  to participate in the traditionally female spheres of domesticity and  consumption is expressed visually in his association with unkempt offices  and seedy boardinghouses.  His disheveled appearance makes clear that he  has been able to resist the lure of the commodity.  By contrast, the gay  male characters' association with luxurious surroundings suggests that they  occupy the same position in relation to the commodity form as the femme  fatale.  Wholly immersed in commodity culture, they are the antithesis of  the hardworking, self-denying entrepreneur.&quot;  Corber is a master of  literary criticism, and his analysis of Williams, Vidal, and Baldwin must  be read in its entirety to be appreciated.  But I do want to introduce  readers of this review to the type of insight which Corber provides.  He  writes that Tennessee Williams was criticized because &quot;whereas  Williams did not hesitate to deal openly with the gay male experience in  his short stories and poetry, he refused to do so in his plays because they  reached a broader audience and might expose his homosexuality to public  scrutiny.&quot;  According to Corber: &quot;This argument positions  Williams as a casualty of the closeted gay male subculture of the  fifties.&quot;  However, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Corber observes that  &quot;Big Daddy tries to convince [his son Brick] that he has no reason to  feel ashamed of being homosexual.&quot;  Corber notes that &quot;the chief  obstacle to Brick's inheriting the estate is his failure to produce an  heir.&quot; Corber explains: &quot;Brick's desire to remain in the closet  indicates that he is unwilling to repress his homosexuality in exchange for  securing his claims to the estate.&quot; Corber observes: &quot;Brick makes  love with Maggie at the end of the play not because he has undergone a  moral transformation and is no longer homosexual but because he refuses to  relinquish the protection afforded by the closet.&quot;  Corber's reading  of this classic of American drama is exceptionally good.  Corber's analysis  of Gore Vidal's  &quot;controversial novel&quot; The City and the Pillar,  in which the &quot;treatment of the of the gay male subculture was clearly  intended to contest the dominant understanding of gay male desire,&quot;  also is impressive.  In Vidal's own words, he &quot;set out to shatter the  stereotype [that male homosexuality was confined for the most part tp  interior decorators and ballet dancers] by taking as [his] protagonist a  completely ordinary boy of the middle class.&quot; According to Corber,  Vidal &quot;hoped that by observing the gay male subculture through the  eyes of an `ordinary' middle-class boy, he could dismantle the binary logic  of sexual difference, a logic that made homosexuality seem  `unnatural.'&quot; Corber explains that Vidal attempted &quot;to define a  male subject-position that is not only homosexual but also masculine.&quot;   According to Corber, &quot;the gay macho style represents the use of an  oppositional form of masculinity that first emerged in the fifties as a  means of staging a desire that does not conform to the domesticated values  of the white suburban middle class.&quot;  For instance, the character  &quot;Bob,&quot; according to Vidal, &quot;perceives his responsibilities  to his family as incompatible with his manhood.  He seems to think that  providing for his family necessitates becoming an `organization man' who  submits to a corporate hierarchy.&quot; Corber's ultimate purpose is to  &quot;show that the roots of the gay liberation movement lay in gay male  opposition to the Cold War consensus&quot; and to challenge &quot;the  tendency of historians&quot; to treat the Fifties &quot;as the Dark Ages of  gay male identity and politics.&quot;  In Corber's view, Williams, Vidal,  and Baldwin &quot;laid the foundation for the gay liberation  movement.&quot;<br />Some readers will find Corber's focus too narrow.  In my  opinion, Corber only touched on the concept that, during the early Cold  War, homosexuality was equated with Communism and left-wing subversion in  order to marginalize and suppress gay male subculture.  The question, of  course, is: Why?  The 1950s in the United States was an era of great  anxiety, and many Americans were searching for enemies in order to vent  their multi-faceted frustrations.  According to Corber, &quot;the Cold War  construction&quot; characterized &quot;the homosexual&quot; as a subversive  who had be exposed because he was secretly undermining the nation's  morality.  Corber has a creative and deeply-penetrating intelligence.   Taken on its own terms, this book is superb.	2000-08-20

Unlike Thomas L.  Friedman's The Lexus and the Olive Tree and A Future Perfect: The Challenge and Hidden Promise of Globalization by John Micklethwait &amp; Adrian Wooldridge (both of which I reviewed here in July), this book is highly critical of the unrestricted expansion of the international economy and integration of its markets.  Indeed, Gray begins by warning: &quot;The Utopia of the global free market has not incurred a human cost in the way that communism did.  Yet over time it may come to rival it in the suffering that it inflicts.&quot; That is a very harsh indictment!  <br />One of the great intellectual debates of the coming decades may revolve around this question: Does the global economy meet human needs?  According to Gray, the answer is &quot;No.&quot; For instance, he writes: &quot;In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown to any other developed country.  Families are weaker in America than in any other country.  At the same time, social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration.&quot; Gray acknowledges that, &quot;[t]he world-historical movement we call globalization has momentum that is inexorable,&quot; but inexorability is not desirability.  Globalization may not be desirable because, according to Gray: &quot;The late-twentieth-century free market experiment is an attempt to legitimate through democratic institutions severe limits on the scope and content of democratic control over economic life.&quot; Gray then asserts: &quot;The free market is not...a gift of social evolution.  It is the end-product of social engineering and unyielding political will.&quot; If Gray is correct, what is globalization's political objective?  I do not believe he ever makes that clear. According to Gray: &quot;Free marketeers tell us that the unprecedented productivity of a rational economic system will remove the causes of social conflict and war.&quot; But Gray counters: &quot;Throughout nearly all of human history, wars have arisen from territorial and dynastic conflicts, from religious and ethnic enmities, and from the divergent economic interests pursued by sovereign states.&quot; Contrary to many predictions following the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to Gray: &quot;The threat to peace has not disappeared with the end of the Cold War.  The nature of war has merely mutated.  One consequence of an anarchic global economy has proved to be a world awash with weapons.&quot; Gray asserts that there is a risk &quot;that sovereign states will be drawn into a struggle for control of the earth's dwindling natural resources.  In the coming century ideological rivalries between states may well be succeeded by Malthusian wars of scarcity.&quot; Gray is especially concerned about the expansion of the global free market and threats to the environment.  In both Russia and China, according to Gray, &quot;partly as an inheritance of central economic planning and partly as a consequence of market reforms, environmental degradation is cataclysmic.&quot; Furthermore, Gray asserts: &quot;If advanced societies are able to protect their environments...it will be partly because they are able to export pollution by moving production to Third World countries where environmental standards are looser.&quot; Some of the most interesting and provocative passages in this book concern Russia and China.  One chapter is entitled title: &quot;Anarcho-capitalism in post-communist Russia.&quot; In it, Gray writes: &quot;The anarchic capitalism which replaced Soviet central planning is surely a developmental phase, not an endpoint in Russian economic development.&quot; According to Gray: &quot;In less than a decade Russia has moved from a functioning totalitarian regime to near anarchy....Thespecies of capitalism that is emerging in Russia today is deeply marked by its Soviet antecedents.  The criminalized markets that flourished in the recesses and interstices of the Soviet state thrive now in its ruins.&quot; Gray also is concerned about globalization's impact on international political stability. According to Gray: &quot;In a world in which market forces are subject to no overall constraint or regulation, peace is continually at risk. Slash-and-burn capitalism...kindles conflict over natural resources. The practical consequence of policies promoting minimal government intervention in the economy is that, in expanding regions of the world, sovereign states are locked in competition not only for markets but for survival.  The global market as it is presently organized does not allow the world's peoples to coexist harmoniously.&quot; Gray frequently compares the first two decades of the 20th century, in which fierce competition for markets and colonies led to two world wars, to our own time.  Although I find this comparison somewhat extreme, it is a chilling thought.  Some readers will find this book unfair in its extended attack on American economic, political, and cultural values.  Gray asserts that the &quot;global free market is an American project,&quot; and he predicts that is &quot;destined to fail.  In this, as in much else, it resembles that other twentieth century experiment in utopian social engineering, Marxian socialism.... Each was ready to exact a large price in suffering from humanity in order to impose its single vision on the world. Each has run aground on vital human needs.&quot; Gray quotes Lee Kuan Yew, formerly Prime Minister of Singapore and now that country's Senior Minister: &quot;Americans believe their ideas are universal - the supremacy of the individual and free, unfettered expression. But they are not - never were.&quot; Without agreeing with Gray, I believe his larger point is that the people of the U.S. may be too optimistic about the long-term, far-reaching effects of globalization, and this point should be well taken.  <br />In summary, Gray's critique of globalization asserts that the global free market contributes to international economic inequality; that increased international economic competition is likely to result in serious environmental degradation; and that international tensions, especially those arising from divergent economic interests, could result in war.  If Gray is correct, the next two decades could be very unpleasant.  Readers may not agree with Gray, but all of us should give careful thought to the concerns which he articulates here.	2000-08-12

Author Richard Butler  served as executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission  (&quot;UNSCOM&quot;) charged with disarming Iraq from 1997 until 1999.   Prior to that, he was Australia's ambassador to the United Nations and  Thailand.  Most of the book is devoted to disarmament issues, especially  efforts to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions requiring Iraq to  destroy its weapons of mass destruction and to forbear rebuilding them and  the subsequent decision to abandon those efforts.  These issues must  concern anyone interested in global security because, in Butler's view, the  post-Cold War &quot;new world order&quot; may be every bit as dangerous as  the frostiest years of the United States-Soviet Union confrontation.  <br />Butler repeatedly demonstrates that he took a narrow, fundamental  legalistic approach to his duties.  He insists that the Security Council's  decisions are binding on all of its members and that the Security Council  has the ability &quot;to enforce its decisions by military force, if  needed.&quot;  According to Butler, Security Council Resolution 687, which  codified the terms of the cease-fire of the Persian Gulf War required Iraq  to destroy all of its weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, chemical,  biological, and missiles.  Resolution 687 also set up the UN Special  Commission - UNSCOM - as an organ of the Security Council to conduct the  actual disarmament work, and the Security Council made completion of the  disarmament work a prerequisite to the lifting of the economic sanctions  imposed on Iraq in 1990. Butler clearly believes that Iraq never intended  to cooperate with UNSCOM.  As a pretext for reusing to cooperate, Iraq  systematically blocked UNSCOM inspections, and this sparked a crisis that  continued for 18 months.  While Butler and UNSCOM were involved in an  increasingly-bitter dispute with Iraq, Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited  Iraq in February 1998 and proclaimed that Saddam Hussein was a man &quot;I  can do business with.&quot;  In early August 1998, Iraq notified the  Security Council that it had &quot;decided to suspend UNSCOM's disarmament  work.&quot;   This led to a serious division in the Security Council, with  the United States and the United Kingdom pitted against Russia, China, and  France, which sought to end the disarmament work and discontinue the  economic sanctions.  UNSCOM was eventually disbanded and replaced by a body  more sensitive to Iraq.  Butler's outlook on the future is pessimistic.   Butler asks: &quot;Is Iraq as dangerous as it was a decade ago?  And he  answers: Elementally yes.&quot;  <br />Although it is a cliché, I believe that  this book is an extended exercise in preaching to the choir.  Readers  concerned with international-security issues already know and probably will  agree with Butler that the UNSCOM period revealed &quot;the real shape of  the post-Cold War world,&quot; and they will share his criticisms of  Russia, France, and China for having &quot;clearly defined, separate  interests in addition to their obviously shared concerns about a unipolar  world.&quot;  Much of this book is a detailed, sometimes tedious, narrative  of Butler's two-year tenure at UNSCOM.  After a while, it is mind-numbing,  but, to the extent that Butler sought to make a historical record, he  succeeds.  This is an important book which ultimately asks: Can anyone have  confidence in the United Nations if it allows cynical self-interest and  endless palaver to prevail over principle and action?	2000-08-09
US	50862643	R1ATBUHOMJT5M3	1557986770	835200598	Legal Blame: How Jurors Think and Talk About Accidents (LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY: PSYCHOLOGY AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES)	Books	5	29	37	N	N	&quot;Total Justice&quot;: The Key to Unlocking Jurors' Minds	At the beginning of this review, I need to disclose my bias: I have known  Neal Feigenson for nearly 15 years: He was on the faculty at the law school  which I attended, and I consider him a friend, as well as a mentor of  sorts.  Although I candidly concede, therefore, that I cannot be entirely  objective about anything written by Professor Feigenson, I am confident  that, by any standard, this is a marvelously intelligent and incisive book  at the intersection of law and social psychology.<br />Torts is taught in the  first year of law school.  The black- letter law - those legal rules which  must be learned - could fit on an index card.  Nevertheless, the concept of  negligence, which is the most important topic in torts, and its application  to cases ranging from automobile collisions to medical malpractice, is very  difficult.  In jury trials, principles of negligence are applied by lay  jurors selected precisely because they know little or nothing about law.   That sounds like a recipe for farce, if not disaster, but it has evolved in  Anglo-American law over a period of nearly 1,000 years.  As a result,  Professor Feigenson's effort to explain how jurors comprehend, interpret,  and apply the rules of legal blame is very important.  According to  Professor Feigenson:: &quot;Legal blaming is multidimensional: It springs  from common sense and is also shaped by legal rules, expert rationales, and  the facts of the individual case.&quot;  The essence of Feigenson thesis  is: &quot;If there is any overarching pattern in [complex lay decision  making] it is that jurors try to achieve what I call total justice.  They  strive to square all accounts between the parties (even though the issues  the law asks them to resolve may not be framed in those terms), to consider  all information they deem relevant (even if the law tries to keep them from  relying on some of it), to reach a decision that is correct as a whole  (even if they reach it by blurring legally distinct questions), and to feel  right about their decision (even though the law discourages them from using  their emotions to decide).  In Feigenson's view, &quot;the more original  and important that this book makes to the understanding of lay decision  making&quot; is to &quot;examine how the words that advocates use to  persuade jurors and the words jurors themselves use to explain their  decisions in several accident cases reflect the social psychology of total  justice.&quot;  In the introduction, Professor Feigenson makes these  important points: &quot;A very small portion of all accidental injuries,  about 1 in 10, results in claims for compensation of any sort, and only a  fraction of these lead to lawsuits;&quot; and &quot;Of all tort cases  filed, about 5% or less are resolved by verdict at trial.&quot;  Later he  provides this interesting statistic. &quot;[P]laintiffs win only a little  more than half of tort cases tried to juries: over 60% for auto accidents,  about 40% for products liability, and about 30% of medical  malpractice.&quot;  I find that surprising: My experience is that most  strong plaintiffs' cases settle, so I might have expected the percentage of  plaintiffs' verdicts to be lower.  In addition, for reasons not clear to  me, slip-and-fall cases are not included; they are notoriously difficult to  win and, had they been factored in, the rate of plaintiffs' victories would  have decreased.  According to Professor Feigenson, he seeks to &quot;shed  light not just on outcomes (of lay decision making) but on how people get  to those outcomes.&quot;  According to Feigenson, &quot;[t]hree general  features characterize lay judgment when it is applied to&quot; accident  cases: (1) Jurors tend to conceive of accidents as melodramas; (2) Juror's  common sense about accidents is full of contradictions; and (3) Jurors  strive &quot;to give total justice.&quot;  Feigenson writes: &quot;By  `total justice,' I mean that jurors are more concerned with making things  come out right than with strictly following the relevant legal rules.&quot;   One of Professor Feigenson's most important observations is that  &quot;social psychology suggests that jurors may tend to conceive of  accidents as melodramas.&quot;  He defines &quot;melodrama&quot; as &quot;a  narrative in which (a) events such as accidents, are caused by individual  human agency; (b) the acts of individuals are explicable in terms of their  character; (c) the agents involved in the accident can be divided into  `good guys' and `bad guys'; (d) the focus of the narrative is the accident  victim and his or her suffering; and (e) the good guy wins (at trial) and  the bad guy gets his or her comeuppance.&quot;  According to Feigenson:  &quot;People's preferences for simple, indeed monocausal, accounts of  events points toward a melodramatic conception of accidents, in which one  and only one party is to blame.&quot;  However, he acknowledges limitations  on the melodramatic conception of accidents.  For instance, jurors &quot;do  not simply yield to the melodrama often offered by plaintiffs'  attorneys,&quot; and &quot;the plaintiff's lawyer may not construct the  case primarily as a melodrama.&quot;  Professor Feigenson devotes a couple  of chapters to actual cases, and the information presented is intriguing,  although probably not extensive enough to draw authoritative conclusions.   There is, therefore, plenty of room for additional investigation.   According to Feigenson: &quot;The ideal way to learn how laypeople think  and talk about blame and compensation when they are serving as jurors would  be to listen to them deliberate. For the most part, however, observing or  recording actual jury deliberations is prohibited.&quot;  But litigants are  increasingly taking advantage of various forms of alternative dispute  resolution outside the courts, and this includes &quot;private&quot; jury  trials.  There is no reason, with the consent of the parties and attorneys,  why deliberations in private jury trials could not be observed, recorded,  and analyzed by properly-credentialed researchers.<br />In conclusion, this  book is superb.  Neal Feigenson is a gifted teacher, able to communicate  complicated concepts clearly.  I recommend Legal Blame both to trial  lawyers seeking insights into how juries arrive at verdicts and to members  of the general reading public who are interested in the inner workings of  the most important proceeding in the civil justice system.	2000-08-06
US	50862643	R2HCN6K3OWQ23M	0691018529	86211037	Strategy in the Missile Age (Princeton Legacy Library)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Strategy for the Ultimate Weapons of the Cold War	This book is a marvelous anachronism!  Written early in the age of intercontinental ballistic missiles by the country's foremost civilian  expert on military strategy, it is an important document for anyone who  wants to understand how strategy for nuclear war evolved.  Brodie believed  nuclear war was &quot;unthinkable,&quot; and, by thinking about the  unthinkable, he clearly hoped to provide an intellectual framework for  avoiding a catastrophe.   <br />Brodie was originally an academic specialist  in military strategy (after leaving academe, he worked for the RAND  Corporation), but he was not an elitist: Early in this fascinating book,  which was written in 1959, at the dawn of the missile age, Brodie wrote:  &quot;Any real expansion of strategic thought to embrace the wholly new  circumstances which nuclear weapons have produced will therefore have to be  developed largely within the military guild itself.&quot;  Indeed, Brodie  looked to a military officer for basic strategic concepts.  According to  Brodie, Italian Brigadier General Giulio Douhet &quot;possessed the largest  and most original mind that this far addressed itself to the theory of air  power.&quot;  Brodie explained: &quot;In its broad outline,  Douhet's...basic argument [was] twofold: first, the nature of air power  requires that `command of the air' be won by aggressive bombing action  rather than by aerial fighting, and second, an air force which achieves  command thereby ensures victory all down the line.&quot;  According to  Brodie, &quot;Douhet's constant refrain&quot; that &quot;[t]he only way to  destroy an enemy air force is to strike at its own bases, and the only  force that can accomplish such destruction is a bomber force.&quot;  In  Brodie's view, Douhet was totally committed to the aerial offensive, and  &quot;Douhet's reasoning required him to place an enormous premium upon  hitting first with all one's might.&quot;  According to Brodie, &quot;[a]ir  power had a mighty vindication in World War II,&quot; although, as Brodie  observed, during World War II, &quot;[t]he battle of Britain resulted in an  outright victory for the defense.&quot;  According to Brodie,  &quot;strategic bombing brought the German war economy to the point of  collapse,&quot; but that result came &quot;too late to develop its full  potential effects on the ground and naval campaigns.&quot;  According to  Brodie: &quot;It was the collapse of transportation which caused the United  States Strategic Bombing Survey, to state...[that] `the German armies,  completely bereft of ammunition and of motive power, would almost certainly  have had to cease fighting by June or July'&quot; of 1945.  Nevertheless,  Brodie wrote, the Allies' &quot;bombing of [German] cities turned out to be  a great waste of time...The bombing of German cities cost the Germans much  in production and more in the diversion of military resources to defense;  but we must nevertheless state that no critical shortages in war  commodities of any kind are traceable to it.&quot;  Brodie concluded that  the effect of bombing German cities was &quot;indecisive.&quot;  He also  asserted: &quot;It is difficult to tell just what proportion of the bombs  dropped on Germany in World War II was deliberately aimed at German morale,  but it was unquestionably very large.&quot;  According to Brodie: &quot;The  huge share of Allied bombs spent in attack on German morale failed to  achieve any important end results&quot; because &quot;people accustomed to  responding to authority - and all peoples are, in modestly varying degrees  - will continue to respond even under very great physical stress.&quot;   According to Brodie: &quot;The strategic air offensive against Japan was  remarkably different from that against Germany in character as well as  result.  It was much more concentrated in time, and had the benefit of the  more advanced technology than available.  Japan was more urbanized than  Germany, its cities were morevulnerable to fire, and its active defenses  at the time of the campaign were of a lower orders of effectiveness, being  mostly confined to antiaircraft guns.  Thus, more was accomplished with  fewer bombs.  Only 160,800 tons of bombs were dropped on the home islands  of Japan, compared to 1,360,000 dropped within the borders of  Germany.&quot;  After providing historical background, Brodie proceeded to  discuss nuclear war: &quot;Under atomic weapons, even ignoring the effects  of fallout, the proportion of persons exposed to risk in cities would be  greater, the incidence of casualties and of lost homes would be multiplied,  and the disorganizing effects upon the surrounding countrysides would be  immeasurably more immediate and direct.&quot;  In Brodie's view, with the  advent of nuclear weapons the entire value of past military experience as a  guide to the future was called into question.  For instance, according to  Brodie: &quot;Since a large thermonuclear bomb exploded over a city would  as a rule effectively eliminate all its industrial activities, there is  hardly much point in asking which industries should be hit and in what  order, or which particular facilities within any industry.&quot;  According  to Brodie: &quot;Warning is the key to the entire defense problem.&quot;   Brodie explained: &quot;The old adage that every new offensive development  inevitably provokes the development of a suitable defense is hard to  justify historically, and it is certainly excessively optimistic for the  nuclear era.  One should hesitate especially to apply it to the ballistic  missile.&quot;  Over 40 years ago, Brodie presciently wrote: &quot;A system  with enough built-in sensitivity to react promptly to any real attack must  be sensitive enough to respond also to false alarms or deliberate enemy  `spoofing.'&quot;  According to Brodie: &quot;The enormous destructiveness  of each delivered nuclear weapon is what makes the ultimate prospects for  the defense, especially for active defense, appear so hopeless.  With  multi-megaton weapons, one on target is already appalling - assuming the  target to be a large city - and the prospect of twenty or thirty on similar  targets is horrendous.&quot;   <br />Written over 40 years ago, this study  obviously is now dated, but it remains a cautionary tale.  If the United  States and the Soviet Union had gone to war in October 1962 during the  Cuban missile crisis, according to Brodie's prediction of three years  earlier, &quot;the minimum of expected fatalities in an enemy strategic  bombing attack probably has to be reckoned in tens of millions.&quot;	2000-08-03

Although this conflict has been called the &quot;good war,&quot; Ronald  Takaki, professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California,  Berkeley and a leading authority on the history of race and culture in the  U.S., asserts: &quot;The `Arsenal of Democracy' was not democratic: defense  jobs were not open to all regardless of race.&quot;  Making high-paying  jobs in the defense industry available to people of color is, perhaps, the  most important theme in this book.  According to Takaki, Americans of all  races and ethnicities &quot;insisted that America live up to ideals and  founding principles&quot; and &quot;stirred a rising wind of diversity's  discontent, unfurling a hopeful vision of America as a multicultural  democracy.&quot;  Relying on reminiscences of Americans of color who lived  and worked during the war, drawn from a wide variety of printed sources, as  well as interviews Takaki conducted, it is quite an achievement!<br />The  racial aspect of the war was summarized by a black draftee who declared:  &quot;Just carve on my tombstone, `Here lies a black man killed fighting a  yellow man for the protection of a white man.'&quot;  Takaki explains that  the Army's policy of segregating black soldiers, &quot;symbolized white  domination in America.&quot;  In addition to discrimination in housing and  training programs, according to Takaki, &quot;blacks were given  &quot;servile work assignments,&quot; and &quot;[s]killed blacks found  themselves occupationally downgraded.&quot;  Takaki also writes: &quot;At  the beginning of the war, blacks were in especially dire economic  straits...The war revived the American economy as an `arsenal of  democracy.'  But, as it turned out, defense jobs were not democratically  distributed; most of them were reserved for whites only.  Seventy-five  percent of the war industries refused to hire blacks.&quot;  Although  Takaki does not provide the source of that statistic, it is not  implausible.  Takaki explains: &quot;Confined to the unskilled and the  service occupations before the war, African Americans wanted the better and  higher paying factory jobs generated by the war.&quot;   In 1941, civil  rights leader A. Philip Randolph organized a march on Washington for July  1.  Meeting with President Roosevelt on June 18, Randolph told FDR that  100,000 people would participate.  A week later Roosevelt signed an  executive order prohibiting &quot;discrimination in the employment of  workers in defense industries or Government.&quot;  However, Takaki writes  that, &quot;as black and white workers followed the defense jobs into the  cities, they often clashed violently.&quot;  For instance: &quot;By 1943,  Detroit was a racial tinderbox.&quot;  On June 20, after a scuffle in a  crowded park, &quot;urban warfare&quot; erupted between whites and blacks,  and it took 6,000 federal troops to restore order.  Five weeks later,  according to Takaki, in New York City, where &quot;blacks were still being  excluded from many defense industry plants, &quot;Harlem exploded,&quot;  resulting in six deaths and 500 injuries.  During the war, 45,000 Indians,  more than 10 percent of the Indian population, served in the U.S. armed  forces.  Indian workers also were attracted to work in defense industries,  but, according to Takaki, they &quot;often received lower wages than that  of whites.&quot;   &quot;Almost 20 percent of all reservation Native  Americans in the armed services came from the Navajo Nation in the  Southwest.&quot;  According to Takaki, in 1941, nearly 40 percent on the  Navajos' annual per capita income of $128 came from wages, mostly from  temporary government employment.&quot;  &quot;Pushed by poverty, the  Navajos were also pulled into the military because they possessed something  uniquely valuable to the U.S. military - their triballanguage.&quot;  In  May 1942, &quot;the first group of Navajo code talkers was sent to San  Diego for training.&quot;  According to Takaki, the Navajo code talkers  &quot;hit every beach from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.&quot;  Many Mexican  Americans worked in agriculture, which was considered a &quot;war  industry.&quot;  The had more difficulty, however, breaking into other  fields.  A 1942 study of the airplane industry in Southern California  reported that &quot;payrolls showed almost no Mexicans employed.&quot;   Later in the war, Mexican Americans were able to get jobs in steel,  armaments, and aircraft, but &quot;they found themselves relegated to the  low wage jobs.&quot;  Their efforts were not always welcomed.  On June 3,  1943, &quot;after some fights between young Mexican Americans and  servicemen in downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of soldiers and sailors went  on a rampage... [chasing] young Mexicans dressed in zoot suits, condemning  their victims as draft dodgers.&quot;  Incidents such as this had great  propaganda value to the enemies of the United States.  According to Takaki,  &quot;the Japanese media gleefully reported the violence as another example  of racism in America.&quot;  According to Takaki, &quot;only 85 Italians  were detained as security threats, and a proposed evacuation of `enemy'  Italian aliens was ruled out.&quot;  In contrast: &quot;The 120,000  Japanese on the West Coast were evacuated and imprisoned in concentration  camps; 40,000 of them, born in Japan, were classified as `enemy  aliens.'&quot; A decade before he became a crusading Chief Justice of the  United States, California Attorney General Earl Warren &quot;urged federal  authorities to evacuate Japanese from sensitive areas of the West  Coast,&quot; warning that the Japanese `may well be the Achilles heel of  the entire civilian defense effort.'&quot;   The Japanese American evacuees  were transported to internment camps in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,  California, andWyoming, mostly in remote desert areas.  During the war,  nevertheless: &quot;33,000 Japanese Americans...decided to seek equality  and justice by serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.&quot; <br />World War II had  many dimensions.  For every book such as James Bradley's marvelous Flags of  Our Fathers, which depicts Americans in war at their very best, there needs  to be another such as Ronald Takaki's Double Victory telling a different  part of the story.  While millions Americans fought against Nazism,  Fascism, and Japanese imperialism around the world, millions of others were  struggling at home to make the United States fully live up to the ideals  and founding of American democracy.  Appreciating World War II as a  multicultural event is essential to a complete understanding of the  American experience in the war.	2000-07-23
US	50862643	R30WXH98XWAA0X	0312241836	94135913	The Cold War: A  MILITARY History	Books	2	12	12	N	N	Far from the Final Word on the Cold War's Military History	Any author seeking to write a military history of the Cold War has undertaken a very formidable task.  The intense and extensive military rivalry - and its related political, economic, and diplomatic competition -  between the American and Soviet superpowers and their respective allies  lasted nearly fifty years and was &quot;fought&quot; on practically every  continent.  So the fact that David Miller's The Cold War: A Military  History is highly selective in the themes it addresses does not, in  principle, trouble me.  As a practical matter, that is the only way that a  military history of the Cold War could be fit into one volume.  But this  book is not really history.  It is, instead, a collection of relatively  short essays, mostly about weapons and weapons systems developed and used  to arm the Cold War military forces.  As an introduction to those subjects,  this book probably has some value, but it is not the narrative of Cold War  military events which the title suggests.    <br />I also take issue with the  book's narrow focus: According to Miller, &quot;central Europe best  symbolizes what went on during the Cold War and is the most likely place  for the fighting to have started.&quot;  That assertion will come as a  surprise to men and women who served in the American armed forces in Korea  and Vietnam, as well as to their Soviet counterparts who served in  Afghanistan.  Miller's approach probably works for most of the period  called the &quot;high Cold War,&quot; which lasted from the first Berlin  crisis in 1948 until the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  But from that point  in time until the demolition of the Berlin Wall in 1989, I would suggest  that the Cold War in central Europe was relatively stable.  In contrast,  during the last three decades of the Cold War, there were serious and  lengthy Cold War conflicts &quot;by proxy&quot; in Vietnam and Afghanistan,  as well as &quot;hot spot&quot; crises elsewhere in Asia, as well as in  Africa and centralAmerica.  Any book purporting to be a general military  history of the Cold War which focuses exclusively on central Europe is  going to mislead, and that is precisely what I consider one of this book's  most serious shortcomings.  Miller's emphasis on events in central Europe  also is of limited value because he devotes too much space to the  possibility of conventional war.  During the formative period of the Cold  War, from the end of the Second World War in Europe until the first Berlin  crisis, the Soviet Union maintained huge tank armies and infantry forces in  eastern Europe.  Precisely in order to deter conventional war, first the  United States and, later, Great Britain and France, developed atomic  weapons.  We will never know, of course, what would have happened if the  Soviet Union's tanks and infantry had invaded western Europe, but I believe  it is virtually certain that the United States would have responded with  strategic and/or tactical atomic weapons.  Indeed, according to Miller,  &quot;at least in public, NATO regarded battlefield nuclear weapons either  as a reasonable response to Soviet first strike or as a last resort in the  face of imminent conventional defeat.&quot;  Nevertheless, Miller deserves  credit for making this significant point: &quot;The perceived threat from  the Soviet Union caused the European nations and those of North America to  draw together through NATO in a way which had never previously proved  possible, even in the face of war.&quot;  Miller writes: &quot;In the mass  of documents released since the end of the Cold War, no evidence has been  found of any Warsaw Pact defensive plans, except for a few formulated in  the three final years, after President Gorbachev had insisted that the  General Staff prepare them.  Instead, all plans concentrated on a series of  massive attacks, which were aimed at securing Soviet control of the entire  west-European land mass.&quot;  That is interesting!  However, this next  point demonstrates Miller's discussion of protracted conventional war  between NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations is superfluous.  Miller writes:  &quot;According to Soviet and East German planning documents, the major  plan for the Central Front aimed at reaching the German-French border in  between thirteen and fifteen days, and then of overrunning France so that  the leading troops arrived at the Atlantic coast and the Franco-Spanish  border by the thirty-fifth day.&quot;  Does anyone believe that the United  States would have permitted the Soviet Union's tanks to race across Germany  and then on to the Atlantic without using every weapon in its nuclear  arsenal to prevent?     When Miller decided to concentrate on weapons and  weapons systems, in my opinion, he also should have decided to provide more  information about their awesome expense because continuously developing and  upgrading equipment was the key feature of the political economy of the  Cold War.  Only in his final chapter does Miller address &quot;The  Financial Cost,&quot; which may, in the long run, prove to be the most  important aspect of the entire Cold War.   But he provides virtually no  details, except to state: &quot;The true costs of defence equipment were  virtually impossible to calculate.&quot;  Miller concludes: &quot;What was  certain...as judged by the eventual collapse of the U.S.S.R., was that the  cost proved to be unaffordable.&quot;   I believe that will be one of the  great historiographical debates of the coming century: Whether Soviet  Communism was simply an ideology whose time came and went or whether the  economic demands of the Cold War simply proved too much for the Soviet  state to sustain?  Furthermore, I believe Miller might have offered some  comments about the nearly-indiscriminate distribution of weapons by the  Cold War antagonists to Third World countries because I believe that is  going to prove to be one of the most serious legacies of the Cold War.     <br />I would recommend David Miller's The Cold War to novices and students  who want some basic information about weapons, weapons systems, and their  impact on certain issues of strategy.  But, the title notwithstanding, this  book is far from the final word on the Cold War's military history.	2000-07-20

Spector  reports these grim statistics: &quot;More than 40,000 civilians had been  killed or wounded in the fighting, and 1 million new refugees had been  created.&quot;  As Spector puts it succinctly, &quot;the Tet Offensive had  shown that no place in Vietnam was truly safe.&quot;  In late March 1968,  President Johnson met with an informal group of elder statesmen and  advisers referred to as the &quot;Wise Men,&quot; and former Secretary of  State Dean Acheson warned: &quot;We cannot do the job we set out to do in  the time we have left, and we must begin to take steps to disengage.&quot;  The President bitterly complained that &quot;the establishment bastards  have bailed out,&quot; but the Wise Men were merely articulating the  consensus public sentiment: The United States could not win the war, so it  had to get out!  Both the political and military leadership of the American  war effort changed in March 1968.  President Johnson first announced that  General William Westmoreland, the top commander in Vietnam, would be  promoted to Chief of Staff of the Army, a move widely viewed, according to  Spector, &quot;as a clear sign that Washington had lost confidence in  Westmoreland's leadership.&quot;  A few days later, Johnson announced that  he would not seek reelection.  But little changed on the ground.  According  to Spector: &quot;Over the eight weeks following the March 31 speech, 3,700  Americans would be killed in Vietnam.&quot;  According to Spector, American  combat forces &quot;faced a formidable enemy.&quot;  He quotes a Navy  corpsman attached to the Marines: &quot;You'll never hear Marines say the  North Vietnamese aren't tough.  They're probably the toughest fighters in  the world as far as I'm concerned.&quot;  They also were determined.  Spector reports: &quot;A study commissioned by the Defense Department in  1967 had concluded that `the enemy's morale was well-nigh indestructible  and therefore not likely to be significantly lowered by pressures on  soldiers in battle.&quot;  Spector explains that &quot;the continued  presence of 550,000 American soldiers in South Vietnam continued to provide  the Communist soldier with his strongest incentive to keep fighting.&quot;  Endemic South Vietnamese corruption undermined the American effort.  According to Spector: &quot;Although South Vietnam received lavish U.S. aid  after [Ngo Dinh] Diem consolidated his power in 1955, much of the aid money  found its way into the pockets of Army officers, provincial officials, and  members of the Ngo family.&quot;  Spector provides these details:  &quot;Beside the sale of jobs and misappropriation of funds and materials,  South Vietnamese generals engaged in a wide array of other rackets,  including the use of their military forces to protect or promote criminal  activities...Drug trafficking was widespread, and many of Saigon's top  officials and generals were rumored to be heavily involved in smuggling and  protection of the opium trade...Another source of profit was trade with theViet Cong.  Large quantities of food, gasoline, medicines, and equipment,  much of it supplied by the United States were sold to the Communists by  South Vietnamese soldiers, usually through middlemen. &quot;  In the summer  of 1968, a major riot occurred at the largest military prison in Vietnam,  the U.S. Army stockade near Long Binh. According to Spector, &quot;the  rioters [were] almost all blacks...Virtually everyone in Vietnam, from  newspaper reporters to stockade guards, joined in labeling the...uprising  primarily a race riot.&quot;  Spector explains: &quot;The most common  source of dissatisfaction was the feeling that African- Americans were  discriminated against in promotions and job opportunities.  A universal  complaint was that blacks were overrepresented in combat units.  It was  also widely believed that in line units African-Americans were always  assigned the most dangerous jobs....Another source of friction was the  alleged discrimination on the part of the military police, most of whom  were white.&quot;  According to Spector: &quot;With the murder of Dr.  Martin Luther King in April 1968, signs of racial polarization and tension  became clear and unmistakable.&quot;  In addition to racial troubles,  Spector writes that, &quot;by the end of the year an even more serious  problem, growing drug abuse, had also made its appearance.&quot;  According  to Spector, although &quot;[m]arijuana was as readily available in Vietnam  as whisky or cigarettes,&quot; its &quot;[u]se of marijuana was a crime  subject to fairly harsh punishment, including possible imprisonment under  the Uniform Code of Military Justice.&quot;  He adds: &quot;By the end of  1968 more and more GIs were turning to drugs to help them escape the heat,  tedium, fear, and loneliness of Vietnam and to hold on to thoughts and  memories of life `back in the world.'  The younger the GI and the lower his  rank, the more likely he was to be a drug user.&quot;<br />According to  Spector, 1968 &quot;ended as it had begun, with bloody yet inconclusive  struggles on the battlefield and continued diplomatic deadlock.&quot;  In  Spector's view: &quot;The battles of 1968 were decisive... because they  were so indecisive...[T]he Vietnam War remained what it had been and would  remain until 1973: a stalemate.&quot;  Spector concludes: &quot;After 1968  both sides recognized that they could never completely destroy or drive out  the opponents from the mountains, jungles, rice paddies, and villages of  South Vietnam.&quot;  To paraphrase Spector's opening question: How did the  United States ever think it could win this war?	2000-07-17
US	50862643	R19A9GPBJMA2ED	0060931558	675570529	Fire In the East: The Rise of Asian Military Power and the Second Nuclear Age	Books	2	6	13	N	N	The Emerging Cold War with Asia	Yale Political Scientist Paul Bracken proclaims that &quot;a world of new military powers is appearing right before our eyes.&quot;  Bracken proceeds to explain: &quot;Asia's new military might was already a major factor in  international politics.&quot;  According to Bracken, &quot;Atomic bombs get  the West's attention,&quot; and he adds: &quot;Whether Asia, and the world,  can contain the international dynamics unleashed by weapons of mass  destruction will be the other great challenge of the twenty-first  century.&quot;  I thought that this book had great promise, but it was very  disappointing. Much of what Bracken writes is correct but obvious, and some  of what he has to say is incorrect, if not utter nonsense.  For instance,  Bracken asserts: &quot;The problem is that the United States isn't thinking  about what it will be like to live in a world where five to ten Asian  countries are nuclear powers, with missiles that can hit distant  targets.&quot;  According to Bracken: &quot;In 1995, China had about fifty  missiles aimed at Taiwan.  Now, 200 missiles are there.  In a few years, a  thousand missiles are likely to be pointed at [Taiwan].&quot;  Bracken is  far from unique in recognizing that the proliferation of nuclear weapons  will be one of the most important international-security issues of the 21st  century.<br />According to Bracken: &quot;An unbroken belt of countries from  Israel to North Korea (including Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, and  China) has assembled either nuclear or chemical arsenals and is developing  ballistic missiles.&quot;  He then asserts: &quot;The ballistic missiles  and atomic, chemical, and biological weapons coming to Asia are all  disruptive technologies.  They nullify Western advantages in conventional  weapons.&quot;  According to Bracken: &quot;Ballistic missiles break down  the entire strategy of forward engagement from fixed bases;&quot; and  &quot;Without bases, there can be no concentration of military power.Weapons cannot be stored, let alone massed for use.  No bases, no weapons.   It is America's singular military weakness in Asia.&quot;  All of this  assumes that, at some point in the relatively near future, the United  States will need to fight a land war in Asia or the west Pacific.  I  believe that is exceptionally unlikely.  On the next point, I believe that  Bracken is absolutely wrong on cause and effect.  He writes:  &quot;Industrialization and globalization increase military potential.   That is the record of the 1990s.&quot;  That is a specious reading of  receny history.  A number of countries, in Asia and elsewhere, have  industrialized without militarizing.  Bracken is correct, however, that the  international arms bazaar is one of the most serious problems in the world:  &quot;Now countries can buy almost whatever they want from others, using  international markets greatly abetted from the forces of  globalization.&quot;  According to Bracken: &quot;Atomic bombs, because  they offset the vast superiority of U.S. conventional forces, are the  premier disruptive technology at work in the world today.&quot;  If that is  correct, it is a curious reversal of the early Cold War pattern, when the  United States's atomic weapons countered the Soviet Union's vast  superiority in conventional forces.  Bracken speculates that &quot;arms  races in Asia might take a form very different from those of the cold war.   China, for example, has no need to take on the United States in strategic  nuclear forces.  It only has to be strong enough to threaten vulnerable  U.S. bases in Asia.&quot;  In my opinion, that is a fundamental misreading  of the strategic realities.  U.S. bases may be vulnerable, but they are  ultimately protected by the deterrent strength of the United States'  massive nuclear superiority. For example, if North Korea were to attack an  American base in Asia, or an American ally such as South Korea or Japan,  with an atomic, chemical or biological weapon, the U.S. could, and almost  certainly would, retaliate with nuclear weapons, and every military  installation, economic asset, and population center in North Korea could be  reduced to a smoking, radiating ruin within minutes.  The dilemma lies in  what the United States would do if North Korea launched a serious  conventional attack against an American ally.  That would recreate the  problem the United States faced in the 1950s in Europe: what provocation is  a sufficiently serious threat to American interests to justify employing  nuclear weapons? According to Bracken: &quot;The shaky control of Asian  nuclear forces increases the danger of accidental or unintended war.&quot;   That is one of Bracken's most significant observations.   &quot;Transitions  of power could be especially dangerous...An upheaval in the government  could open the way to military adventures with catastrophic  consequence.&quot;  Bracken states the obvious: &quot;Asia is rife with  sectarian disputes, which are likely to take on a more ominous character in  an environment of weapons of mass destruction.&quot;  Israel's long  standoff with its Muslim neighbors and the India-Pakistan rivalry are the  most obvious examples of this point.  Bracken probably also is correct when  he writes: &quot;The rise of Asian military power makes for a new  relationship between the west and Asia.&quot; Nevertheless, according to  Bracken: &quot;The rise of Asian military power does not argue for a U.S.  pullback from the world military.  It argues instead for a restructured  U.S. military, one that can operate at greater distances from home and is  less reliant on vulnerable forward bases;&quot; and &quot;[T]he United  States cannot continue to base its fighting power in these installations  because they are becoming too vulnerable to attack.&quot;  As I asserted  above, this is the real dilemma: When is an attack on American interests  sufficiently serious threat to justify using nuclear weapons?<br />This book  contains no foot- or endnotes and only a short bibliography, so it clearly  was written for a general audience.  Nevertheless, practically none of  Bracken's observations are profound, and some of his conclusions result  from superficial, if not wrongheaded, analysis.  However, this book cannot  be completely dismissed. My criticisms notwithstanding, the issues Bracken  raises are of vital importance.  The world, may in fact, be on the verge of  another cold war, one which could be every bit as unstable as its earliest  manifestation during its most virulent period, between the late 1940s and  the middle 1960s.	2000-07-15
US	50862643	R2BPZVHEIQYHRJ	0060929081	900958788	Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam	Books	4	132	142	N	N	Waging War Without Consideration of Costs and Consequences	This carefully-researched, highly-detailed study of military policymaking during the formative period of the Vietnam War focuses on events between November 1963 through July 1965, when the Johnson administration made a  series of disastrous decisions leading to the commitment of American ground  troops, which resulted in over 50,000 deaths during the next decade.  H.R.  McMaster, a career Army officer with a Ph.D. in history who served on the  faculty at the U.S. Military Academy, asserts that President Johnson,  Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff  disagreed about policy and then lied to the American people about that  policy.  Using &quot;[r]ecently declassified documents, newly opened  manuscript collections, and the release of the official history of the  [Joint Chiefs of Staff] during the Vietnam War,&quot; McMaster's disturbing  narrative of dishonesty and intrigue casts the highest civilian and  military officials of the government in a very unfavorable light.  McMaster  seeks to understand and explain &quot;decisions that involved the United  States in a war that it could not win at a politically acceptable level of  commitment.&quot;  It is an a ugly picture.<br />According to McMaster:  &quot;Under the National Security Act the Joint Chiefs of Staff were  `principal military advisers to the president, the National Security  Council, and the Secretary of Defense.'&quot; However, McMaster writes,  McNamara never had a good relationship with the Chiefs because they  &quot;were unable to respond to McNamara's demands fast enough, and their  cumbersome administrative system exacerbated the administration's  unfavorable opinion of them;&quot; and &quot;McNamara quickly lost patience  with the Chiefs' unresponsiveness and squabbling.&quot;  According to  McMaster, although President Kennedy &quot;was willing to send U.S.  military `advisers' into South Vietnam and mount covert operations in North  Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, he drew the line at U.S. combat units.&quot;   McMaster writes that November 1963, when both Ngo Dinh Diem and Kennedy  were assassinated, &quot;marked a turning point in the Vietnam War.&quot;  According to McMaster: &quot;McNamara soon established himself as the most  indispensable member of Johnson's cabinet.&quot;  McMaster writes:  &quot;McNamara believed that &quot;military pressure would aim to convince  Hanoi to stop supporting the Viet Cong.&quot;  But the Chiefs warned that  McNamara's plan &quot;would be insufficient to `turn the tide' against the  Viet Cong.&quot;  In McMaster's view: &quot;At the end of March, after the  president had approved McNamara's strategy of graduated pressure,  discontent within the Joint Chiefs of Staff bubbled to the surface.&quot;   This may be McMaster's most damning criticism: &quot;Each Chief's desire to  further his own service's agenda hampered their collective ability to  provide military advice... The Chiefs desperately needed a leader to bring  them together.&quot;  However, the appointment of Army General Earle  Wheeler as Chairman of the J.C.S. &quot;was immensely unpopular with many  Pentagon officers, particularly those outside the Army.&quot;  According to  McMaster: &quot;Differences of opinion among the Chiefs stemmed, in part,  from their institutional perspectives as heads of their services.  It  seemed that each service, rather than attempt to determine the true nature  of the war and the source of the insurgency in South Vietnam, assumed that  it alone had the capacity to win the war.&quot;  By the summer of 1964,  according to McMaster, the JCS had been reduced to serving &quot;more as  technicians for planners in the [Office of the Secretary of Defense] than  as strategic thinkers and advisers in their own right.&quot;  In 1964 and  early 1965, President Johnson focused on getting elected and advancing his  domestic agenda.  On November 1, 1964, the Viet Cong attacked the American  airfield at Bien Hoa.  According to McMaster, Chairman of the JCS, General  Earle &quot;Wheeler reported to McNamara that the Chiefs believed that, if  the United States did not take action against North Vietnam immediately, it  should withdraw all forces from South Vietnam.&quot;  McMaster writes with  brutal frankness: &quot;On the first day of his four-year term, Johnson hid  the truth about Vietnam for the sake of a domestic political agenda.   McNamara assisted his dissembling.&quot;  In late January 1965, according  to McMaster, President Johnson &quot;authorized the resumption of destroyer  patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin&quot; &quot;[i]n hopes of provoking a North  Vietnamese attack.&quot;   According to McMaster: &quot;In February 1965  President Johnson made decisions that transformed the conflict in Vietnam  into an American war...[T]he president's decision, at the end of February,  to introduce U.S. ground combat units into South Vietnam represented an  irrevocable commitment to the war.&quot;  McMaster then makes this  disturbing assertion: &quot;Although the JCS thought that the president's  policy was fundamentally flawed, their actions supported and reinforced  it.&quot;  This is the essence of McMaster's indictment of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff: &quot;The body charged with providing the president with military  advice and responsible for strategic planning permitted the president to  commit the United States to war without consideration of the likely costs  and consequences.&quot;  According to McMaster: &quot;When the Chiefs  endeavored to carry out the president's instructions [in April-May 1965],  interservice differences over how to fight the war in Vietnam  resurfaced..&quot;  As a result, McMaster writes: &quot;American soldiers,  airmen, and Marines went to war in Vietnam without strategy or  direction.&quot;  According to McMaster: &quot;The `five silent men' on the  Joint Chiefs made possible the way the United States went to war in  Vietnam.&quot;  McMaster asserts: &quot;The Joint Chiefs of Staff became  accomplices in the president's deception and focused on a tactical task,  killing the enemy. General Westmoreland's `strategy' of attrition in South  Vietnam was, in essence, the absence of strategy.&quot;  McMaster  concludes: &quot;The war in Vietnam...was lost in Washington, D.C., even  before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting in 1965 and  before they realized the country was at war; indeed, even before the first  American units were deployed.&quot;<br />The Joint Chiefs' submission to  civilian control of grand strategy is understandable.  But their  interservice rivalries were inexcusable.  I agree, therefore, with  McMaster's most important point: The fact that Americans were dying in  Vietnam while the Chiefs engaged in high-level turf battles constituted  dereliction of duty.  But, as McMaster also amply and ably demonstrates,  there is plenty of blame to go around.	2000-07-11
US	50862643	R302B4IP22AUA4	0691048908	624009895	In the Shadow of the Garrison State	Books	4	12	13	N	N	The Cold War as the Engine of American State-Building	In 1947, Hanson Baldwin, the military correspondent for The New York Times asked  whether the United States could &quot;prepare for the next, truly total war...without becoming a `garrison state.'&quot;  According to  Princeton Professor Aaron Friedberg, by the middle of the 20th, &quot;the  imminent threat of war produced pressures for the permanent construction of  a powerful central state.&quot;  Friedberg argues, however, that the size  and scope of the federal government was held in check during the Cold War  by a tradition and ideology of anti-statism.  Although this book merely  synthesizes previously- published works, it effectively argues that the  apparatus of the American state grew less during the Cold War than might  have been have been expected.   <br />Friedberg examines &quot;five main  mechanisms of power creation: those intended to extract money and manpower  and those designed to direct national resources toward arms production,  military research, and defense-supporting industries.&quot;  Friedberg  explains: &quot;In the span of only two decades the United States was  engulfed in three waves of crisis as depression, world war, and cold war  followed each other in rapid succession.  The onset of each emergency  produced a powerful impetus toward state-building.&quot;  The early-Cold  War debate about defense spending demonstrates Friedberg's point.  He  writes that &quot;the American people wanted a state that was strong enough  to defend them against their foreign enemies but not strong enough to  threaten their domestic liberties,&quot; defending the country was  expensive.  In 1949, when President Truman wanted to hold defense spending  for the next fiscal year, to $14.4 billion, the Secretary of Defense  instructed the service chiefs to base their estimates &quot;on military  considerations alone,&quot; which resulted  in a &quot;wish list with a  staggering $30 billion price tag.&quot;  Truman's final budget message  estimated the annual cost of sustaining his planned long-term force posture  to be $35 to $40 billion.  According to Friedberg, President Eisenhower's  &quot;commitment to holding down defense spending was a logical outgrowth  of his essentially anti-statist philosophy of political economy,&quot; and,  in June 1954, he warned that a massive new buildup would involving   transformation of the United States into &quot;a garrison state.&quot;  In  1960, John Kennedy asserted that Eisenhower's &quot;excessive attention to  the budget&quot; had &quot;resulted in a serious weakening of the nation's  defenses.&quot;  Compulsory military service also generated intense debate.   Senator Robert Taft warned that the adoption of universal military  training would transform the United States into a &quot;militaristic and  totalitarian country.&quot;  According to Friedberg, &quot;the strongest  and most consistent congressional opposition to came from the Republican  party, and in particular from its conservative midwestern wing.  It was in  this part of the country that principled anticompulsion arguments struck  their most responsive chord.&quot;  According to Friedberg: &quot;The  widespread animosity to statism that characterized the early post-war  period...played a critical role in blocking the creation of new, powerful  governmental industrial planning institutions.&quot;  Friedberg explains:  &quot;Even in the face of an enemy, and to a remarkable degree even in  wartime, the American system has proven itself to be highly resistant to  centralized industrial planning.&quot;  Friedberg writes:  &quot;[T]he push  for privatization, and the ideological language in which it was couched,  also raised troubling questions about the legitimacy of the military's  large-scale industrial activities, even those with long traditions.   In  the context of a worldwide contest with communism, private ownership of the  means of production came to be regarded...as morally superior to any  alternative form of economic organization.&quot;  According to Friedberg:  &quot;The postwar privatization of American arms production was the end  result of a protracted process of debate and political struggle...At the  most general ideological level the burgeoning anti-statist sentiments in  the 1940s and 1950s tended to strengthen the hands of the privatizers and  to discredit those who advocated anything that savored of socialism.&quot;   In discussing the structure of the U.S. research and development system and  its performance during the Cold War, Friedberg asserts that the  &quot;large, open, and loose-limbed American system was well suited for  promoting innovation, and it tended over time to outperform its more rigid,  closed, and hierarchical Soviet counterpart.&quot;   According to  Friedberg: &quot;[F]or nearly a half century, the pursuit of qualitative  superiority [in military technology] was a central, persistent feature of  the entire American defense effort.&quot;   Friedberg explains:  &quot;Before the Second World War had ended and the Cold war began, senior  American scientists and top military planners were already agreed that the  preservation of a `preeminent position' in weapons technology must be a  central goal of peacetime defense policy.&quot;  &quot;The clear emergence  of the Soviet Union as the most likely enemy in any future war added  urgency and a clear focus to the discussion of the role of technology in  American strategy.&quot;   Friedberg reports: &quot;`Atomic weapons used  tactically are the natural armaments of numerically inferior but  technologically superior nations,' declared one congressional enthusiast in  1951.&quot;  He explains: &quot;The Eisenhower administration elevated the  substitution of firepower for manpower to the position of key organizing  principle of national strategy.  Atomic and thermonuclear weapons of every  conceivable yield were...at the heart of Western defenses;&quot; and   &quot;For the West, by the mid-1950s, preserving technological supremacy  had become even more essential and urgent than it had appeared only a few  years before.&quot;  According to Friedberg: &quot;Critics and enthusiasts  alike agree that the American research and development system was highly  productive of technological advances, that it tended over time to outpace  its Soviet counterpart, and that the superior performance of the American  system was connected in some way to its structure.&quot; <br />Was there ever  a real likelihood that Cold War America would turn into a &quot;garrison  state?&quot;  The clear answer is: No.  References to the garrison state  were rhetorical devices used most often by congressional opponents of the  concentration of power in the executive branch in Washington, D.C. But  Friedberg is absolutely correct that anti- statist rhetoric had powerful  antecedents in American history and, therefore, resonated deeply with the  public.  The specter of creating a garrison state was ominous, even when it  was intentionally exaggerated.	2000-07-07

Although John Bradley  was reticent with his own family, his son writes: &quot;The flagraising on  Iwo Jima became a symbol of the island, the mountain, the battle; of World  War II; of the highest ideals of the nation, of valor incarnate.&quot;   <br />The conquest of Iwo Jima, a tiny, barren, isolated island in the north  Pacific Ocean, was needed &quot;to provide air cover and an emergency  landing strip for the B-29 bombers flying from their base in Tinian to  their targets in Japan.&quot;  The assault began on February 19, 1945 with  a difficult amphibious assault, the Marines' specialty.  According to  Bradley: &quot;Eighty thousand American boys fought aboveground, twenty  thousand Japanese boys fought from below.&quot; After the 36-day battle,  which resulted in over 25,000 American casualties, including over 7,000  dead, Admiral Chester Nimitz declared: &quot;Uncommon valor was a common  virtue.&quot;  The younger Bradley asks: &quot;Why did [John Henry Bradley]  almost never speak of the past, and then only painfully, between long  excruciating silences?&quot;  He then answers: &quot;The real story, as Dad  saw it, was simple and unadorned: A flag needed to be replaced.  The pole  was heavy.  The sun was just right.  A chance shot turned an unremarkable  act into a remarkable photograph.&quot; <br />This book is, of course, a  mammoth bestseller, and I enjoyed every minute of reading it in an evening.   I don't know whether it is a great book, but it is a great story, and any  reader will be rewarded and inspired by spending a few hours with the  fascinating story of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima.	2000-07-04

Since 1994, Friedman has specialized in covering the  intersection between foreign policy and international finance, so he is an  ideal interpreter of globalization - the trend toward international  economic integration through free-market capitalism.  This book is a fine  introduction to events profoundly impacting on our world, written in  Friedman's characteristically clear and crisp prose.  The &quot;Lexus&quot;  in Friedman's title stands for &quot;the drive for sustenance, improvement,  prosperity and modernization,&quot; whereas the &quot;olive tree&quot;  &quot;represents everything that roots us, anchors us, identifies us and  locates us in the world - whether it be belonging to a family, a community,  a tribe, a nation, a religion or, most of all, a place called home.&quot;   Much of Friedman's book is devoted to the theme of the Lexus and olive tree  wrestling with each other in order to find a healthy balance.  According to  Friedman: &quot;The challenge in this era of globalization - for countries  and for individuals - is to find a healthy balance between preserving a  sense of identity, home and community and doing what it takes to survive  within the globalization system.&quot;   <br />In Friedman's view, the  &quot;slow, fixed, divided Cold War system&quot; is readily distinguishable  from the &quot;new, very greased, interconnected&quot; world of  globalization, in which free-market capitalism is spreading throughout the  world.  According to Friedman: &quot;While the defining measurement of the  Cold War was weight - particularly the throw weight of missiles - the  defining measurement of the globalization system is speed - speed of  commerce, travel, communication and innovation.&quot;  In contrast to the  Cold War's &quot;overly regulated, walled up system,&quot; Friedman  explains that globalization's three &quot;democratization&quot; - the  democratization of information, the democratization of technology, and the  democratization of finance - are changing the way business and everything  else is done.  In Friedman's view, &quot;what is new...is the sheer number  of people and countries able to partake of today's globalized economy and  information networks, and to be affected by them.&quot;  According to  Friedman, &quot;the Internet offers the closest thing to a perfectly  competitive market in the world today.&quot;  Friedman explains: &quot;In  the 1980s the Internet was a novelty.  By the 1990s it was a useful  technology.  By the time the new millennium rolled around it was an  indispensable tool for doing business.&quot;  Friedman writes at some  length about what he cleverly calls &quot;the Electronic Herd,&quot; which  is &quot;made up of all the faceless stock, bond and currency traders  sitting behind computer screens all over the globe, moving their money  around from mutual funds to pension funds to emerging markets, or trading  on the Internet from their basements.&quot; According to Friedman:  &quot;Countries cannot thrive in today's world without plugging into the  Electronic Herd.&quot;  Friedman explains that, with &quot;the end of the  Cold War system and the fall of walls everywhere, there suddenly emerged a  vast global plain where investor herds from many different countries could  roam freely.&quot;  Friedman acknowledges that the effects of globalization  are not entirely positive. For instance, Friedman acknowledges that the  Electronic Herd is &quot;potentially more volatile&quot; than previous  models, and that makes markets less stable.  According to Friedman,  &quot;today, in the globalization era, the ability of the herd to transmit  instability from bad countries to good countries has vastly  increased.&quot;  In addition, Friedman predicts that the system of  globalization will &quot;both environmental disasters and amazing  environmental rescues.&quot;  The prospect of environmental problems in the  new world order is especially troubling.  Friedman asks: &quot;Can we  develop a method of environmentally sustainable globalization?&quot; He  answers: &quot;One hope is clearly that technology will evolve in ways that  will help us preserve green areas faster than the Electronic Herd can  trample them.&quot;  Friedman adds: &quot;But technological breakthroughs  alone will not be enough to neutralize the environmental impact of the  herd, because the innovations simply are not happening fast enough -  compared to how fast the herd moves, grows and devours.&quot;  Friedman  places his hope in &quot;super-empowered environmentalists&quot; &quot;who,  acting on their own, can now fight back effectively against both the  Electronic Herd and governments...[M]ore and more multinationals are  realizing that to preserve their global reputation and global brands in the  face of Internet activism, they need to be environmentally  responsible.&quot;  Friedman also offers this cautionary observation:  &quot;[I]n 2000 we understand as much about today's system of globalization  is going to work as we understood how the Cold War system was going to work  in 1946.&quot;  Friedman's point, I believe, is that, although we have been  able to give a name - globalization - tothe most powerful force changing  the world, that does not mean that we are close to fully comprehending it.   Some aspects of the globalized world are fully comprehensible and  frightening.  Notwithstanding the manifest benefits of globalization, there  is an ongoing backlash against it.  In particular,  Friedman warns about  &quot;the real, immediate national security threat&quot; from what he calls  &quot;the Super-Empowered Angry Man,&quot; such as the Aum Shinrikyo sect  in Japan, the Unabomber, Osama bin Laden, and the Ramzi Yousef group in New  York.  Friedman implies, quite correctly I believe, that, the globalized  world may be very exciting, but it also remains a very dangerous place.  Friedman obviously believes that most of the globalization process is  beneficial, and he probably is correct, but he also is not entirely  objective.  Friedman is not merely a pundit.  He is a proponent for  globalization.  He writes: &quot;You cannot thrive today without plugging  into the Electronic Herd.&quot;<br />This book is excellent, and, all things  considered, I believe it is superior to John Micklethwait and Adrian  Woolridge's A Future Perfect: The Challenge and Hidden Promise of  Globalization, another introduction to globalization which I recently read  and reviewed. However, I would recommend either.  Whether one is a  globalization proponent or opponent or neutral, the system is changing the  world, and that behooves all of us to understand it better.	2000-07-03

I approached reading this book with the assumption that I would viscerally dislike it: I hate popular culture; I consider myself, at best, to be a technological agnostic; and my impression was the &quot;globalization&quot;  is being generated by international-business buccaneers.  However, I  discovered that John Micklethwait and Adrian Woolridge, correspondents for  The Economist, are adept popularizers of complicated contemporary concepts;  they share a certain sense of humor; and, while championing globalization's  purported benefits, they are willing to acknowledge some of its more  serious problems.  This book is, therefore, a solid, if not compelling,  introduction to the subject.<br />Micklethwait and Woolridge do not offer  dispassionate analysis of globalization and its impact on international  business, politics, and culture.  Indeed, the authors are advocates, and  they are candid about their biases, declaring: &quot;[T]he underlying  message of this book is that globalization needs not merely to be  understood but to be defended.&quot;  The reason, according to Micklethwait  and Woolridge, is: &quot;Globalization has become, quite simply, the most  important economic, political, and cultural phenomenon of our time.&quot;   That's probably hyperbole, but, without debating that point, the first  issue is: What is globalization?  In its most basic terms, globalization is  the trend toward  integration of the world economy into a single market.   And what drives globalization?  Micklethwait and Woolridge answer:  Technology, the capital markets, and management.  They might have added:  International financial institutions.  According to Micklethwait and  Woolridge, &quot;it is certainly true that many important decisions about  the world economy have been made by a small cabal of technocrats at four  institutions in Washington, D.C.: the World Bank, the IMF, the U.S.  Treasury, and the Federal Reserve Board.&quot;  Nevertheless, the process  of globalizationstill has a long way to go.  According to Micklethwait and  Woolridge: &quot;Consultants at McKinsey reckon that only a fifth of world  outputs, or $6 trillion out of $28 trillion, is open to global competition  in products, service, or ownership.&quot;  The issue is whether this is a  good thing.  Micklethwait and Woolridge seek to dispel the following  &quot;myths&quot; about globalization: (1) it is leading to the triumph of  big companies; (2) it is ushering in an age of global products; (3) it has  ended the traditional business cycle; (4) it is a zero-sum game (some  people have to lose in order for others to win); and (5) geography does not  matter in the new global economy.  The authors also reject various  criticisms of globalization, including the allegations that it contributes  to &quot;the rise of homogenized airport culture;&quot; that it involves  the &quot;loss of democratic accountability;&quot; that &quot;countries  ruin themselves by reducing taxes, benefits, and environmental controls in  order to woo rootless companies;&quot; and that it is epitomized by the  &quot;weakness of global institutions such as the United Nations.&quot;   The book is full of anecdotes, some of which are quite revealing.  However,  anecdote is not argument, and some of the authors' anecdotes in defense of  globalization are simply exceptions to accurate generalizations.   Micklethwait and Woolridge also tend to make profound statements of the  obvious.  For example: &quot;The full impact of events that took place  roughly a decade ago, such as the collapse of the iron curtain and the  introduction of Europe's single market, is only just beginning to be  felt.&quot;  On the other hand, Micklethwait and Woolridge occasionally  display genuine insight.  According to Micklethwait and Woolridge:  &quot;Much of the globalizing drive and energy of multinationals is  provided by the management industry: the business schools, consultancies,  and gurus.&quot;  Are we certain wewant these people and institutions  creating the dominant ideology of the post-Cold War world? The authors give  us further reason to pause and ponder when they write at some length about  &quot;cosmocrats,&quot; whom they define as the class of people &quot;who  have benefitted from globalization.&quot;  Their description of this class  includes the observations that they are &quot;[c]osmopolitan in  taste,&quot; &quot;usually Anglo-American in outlook,&quot; and preach a  &quot;gospel of wealth.&quot;  The authors then declare:  &quot;These  people constitute perhaps the most meritocratic ruling class the world has  seen.&quot;  In my opinion, the cosmocrats sound like just another elite.   The fact that they have mastered the international economy - which is the  basis for their self-interested conclusion that their ascendancy is based  on meritocracy - does not give them a moral right to rule. Micklethwait and  Woolridge observe that the &quot;cosmocrats are increasingly cut off from  the rest of society,&quot; and the authors express this concern: &quot;One  of the great risks of globalization is that it fosters anomie - the  normalness that comes from having your ties with the rest of society  weakened...The most common complaint among Internet addicts&quot; is that  they are &quot;isolated, lonely, and depressed.&quot;  I was not persuaded  by the concluding chapter, entitled &quot;The Hidden Promise: Liberty  Renewed.&quot;  According to Micklethwait and Woolridge, the &quot;belief  in individualism, which was at the heart of both the Enlightenment and the  American Revolution, was actually a fairly global movement.&quot; According  to Micklethwait and Woolridge, &quot;the recent history of globalization  can be written as a story...of spreading a political culture that is based  on individual liberty&quot;  Even if that is an accurate statement of the  cosmocrats' ideology, there is no guarantee that they will prove to be good  global citizens.  In fact, the cosmocrats may already have failed their  first test: Micklethwait and Woolridge acknowledge that &quot;globalization  has certainly been a mixed blessing for the environment.&quot; <br />In the  final analysis, I am concerned about the prospect of building a global  community based on an ideology that exalts exuberant (and sometimes  rapacious) individualism.  Micklethwait and Woolridge are globalization  advocates, and they are at their strongest when they discuss economic  matters.  They clearly believe that it will be the key organizing principle  for 21st-century business, but I remain skeptical about globalization's  impact on international politics and culture.  Nevertheless, I am glad that  I read this book and then spent some time thinking about its powerful  thesis.  I believe we now need a serious, non-Luddite, left-liberal  critique of globalization.	2000-07-01

Millett, two veteran American academic historians, are to be commended for producing this authoritative,  one-volume military history of World War II.  It is a wonderful  achievement!  Their book is nearly 600 pages long, and it would be  impossible to address every issue in a brief, 1000-word review. I will,  therefore, confine myself to the authors' treatment of the effectiveness of  the United States' military operations, with the understanding that this is  representative of the authors' approach to the broader issues and  topics.<br />According to the authors, &quot;World War II was a conflict of  resources as well as ideologies.&quot;  Virtually every reader is familiar  with the ideological dimension, but Murray and Millett focus much attention  on the war's political economy.  One of the Americans' greatest  contributions to the Allied effort was, when possible, to address military  problems &quot;through their legendary productivity.&quot;  The authors  emphasize: &quot;So vast was American war production that the United States  not only armed itself but shared its output with the other Allies.&quot;   Murray and Millett write: &quot;Logistical superiority was crucial to the  Allies' victory, and America's role as the `Arsenal of Democracy' made a  crucial difference.  Not only did the United States carry the burden of  most of the naval campaign in the Pacific and an increasing load of the  combat in Europe as the war progressed, but its Lend-Lease program was  essential to the military operations of its allies and to the functioning  of their wartime economies.&quot;  There are numerous examples of the  wartime application of American productivity.  For instance, in 1940, over  a year before the U.S. entered the war, it &quot;recognized that the German  assault on world shipping posed a significant threat to its own strategic  position,&quot; and the Americans' development of the Liberty ship - which  was constructed in sections and then welded together - proved to be a  mass-production concept that revolutionized shipbuilding.&quot;  Similarly,  in April 1942, when, the &quot;Navy was unprepared to handle the U-boat  onslaught...for many reasons, including the fact that it had too few  escorts,&quot; the United States embarked on a program to produce 60 escort  vessels in 60 days, and when it achieved that goal, it announced another  such program.&quot;  According to Murray and Millett: &quot;A major  dimension of the industrialization of warfare was the commitment to develop  and deploy new weapons that would give one's armed forces distinct  operational and tactical advantages over the enemy,&quot; and, of course,  the design and construction of the atomic bomb by an international team of  scientists remains one of the most remarkable scientific and technological  achievements of all time. Examining the war with Japan is the best way to  assess American military performance during World War II because only in  the Pacific did the United States fully deploy every element of its air,  ground, and naval forces.  The Navy had years to plan for the  virtually-inevitable war with Japan.  According to the authors, however, it  was not until after Pearl Harbor that the U. S. finally began preparing in  earnest.  Murray and Millet write that &quot;FDR simply stated the  obvious&quot; when he declared that &quot;only American air-naval power  could eventually roll back the Japanese from their Pacific outposts and  liberate the conquered states of Southeast Asia and China.&quot;  Army  Chief of Staff George C. Marshall &quot;worried about the diversion of army  resources from Europe to the Pacific war,&quot; but even after the disaster  at Pearl Harbor, according to the authors, the United States' &quot;Pacific  Fleet retained much of its combat power, which would surge in 1943 with the  arrival of battleships, carriers, and cruisers already being built, ships  that would not be needed in thecampaign against German submarines.&quot;   Murray and Millett quote Admiral William F. Halsey's &quot;simple South  Pacific guidance:&quot; &quot;Kill Japs!  Then kill more Japs.&quot;  The  war against Japan was won with significant contributions from each of the  services.  The tide of the surface naval conflict began to turn in the  late-spring 1942 with the Battle of Midway, which Murray and Millett  characterize &quot;as not quite a Trafalgar but far from an indecisive  Jutland.&quot;  In addition, American submarines forced Japan's economic  collapse by devastating its merchant marine.  The army and marines dug out  tenacious Japanese defenders from islands across the Pacific from late 1942  through the spring of 1945.  And the air force's campaign against Japanese  cities culminated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Notwithstanding the success of American arms, Murray and Millet are not  reluctant to criticize, and their vignettes of some American commanders are  brutal in their succinct candor: On General Douglas MacArthur:  &quot;MacArthur's paranoia, lust for personal publicity, political  ambition, structured and comfortable lifestyle, and hypochondria were well  known in the army;&quot; General Mark Clark: &quot;Many of Clark's  contemporaries believed he possessed one of the best minds in the U.S.  Army.  Others believed his character consisted of equal parts vanity and  slipperiness;&quot; and General Omar Bradley: &quot;dour, unimaginative,  and deeply jealous.&quot;<br />The costs of World War II were staggering.  Millions died in combat, and millions of civilians also perished.  In  financial terms, &quot;the United States spent almost $350 billion on its  war effort.&quot;  Nevertheless, according to Murray and Millett,  World  War II &quot;remains `the good war' in American historical  imagination.&quot;  There are many reasons for this.  One is that the  United States and its Allies fought and defeated enemies whose despicableideology threatened every freedom that Americans enjoy.  Another is that  &quot;the United States emerged from World War II stronger in both absolute  and relative terms than it was when it entered the war.&quot;  Murray and  Millett's concise and perceptive  treatment of American operations during  World War II is indicative of the consistent excellence of this book.  I am  certain that it will rapidly prove to be simply indispensable to  professional historians and students, but I also recommend it without  qualification to general readers who want to know more about military  operations in the global conflict which established the United States as  the world's greatest power.	2000-06-29
US	50862643	R173N2FKLU0SBN	0684836254	502176195	Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator	Books	3	28	49	N	N	Conflicting Cold War Visions: McCarthy and the &quot;Wise Men&quot;	In November 1999, The New York Times Magazine heralded Senator Joseph McCarthy 's &quot;rehabilitation,&quot; and author Arthur Herman, an adjunct professor at George Mason University, recently weighed in with this  book, which seeks to portray the early 1950s Wisconsin politician as a  well-intentioned participant in public discourse about a legitimate issue.   We must be careful with facts and terms.  Herman is absolutely correct in  writing that &quot;most of what people ordinarily mean when they talk about  the `red scare' - the House Un-American Activities Committee;  anti-Communist probes into Hollywood, labor unions, and America's schools  and universities; the Rosenberg trial; blacklisting in the media and  schoolteachers fired for disloyalty - had nothing to do with  McCarthy.&quot;  Herman is equally correct that McCarthy's Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations &quot;had a specific duty to investigate  communism in the federal government and among government employees.&quot;   The essence of Herman's interpretation is that, when that narrow record is  carefully examined, McCarthy and McCarthyism were not as bad as  commentators of the period and many historians contend.  <br />In some  respects, McCarthy's rise was remarkable. According to Herman, his life was  &quot;a typical American success story: son of a poor Wisconsin dirt  farmer...to U.S. senator.&quot;  Unlike many of the government officials  against whom he latter battled, McCarthy was a product of hard times and  conditions: McCarthy &quot;left school at fourteen to start his own  business, raising chickens and buying a truck to drive the eggs to  market.&quot;  In contrast, opponents such as Harry Truman's Secretary of  State Dean Acheson, the leader of the informal group known as the  &quot;Wise Men,&quot; formed &quot;the core of America's foreign policy  establishment.&quot;  What resulted, according to Herman, was &quot;a  cultural clash.&quot;  The feelings were mutual.  For the WiseMen and  their allies in Washington, D.C., according to Herman, &quot;there was no  opponent they despised more than Joe McCarthy. He was working class: they  were varsity class.  He was hairy, loud, and sweaty; they were cool, clean,  and antiseptic.&quot;  According to Herman: &quot;The furor over McCarthy  and McCarthyism obscured the fact that the Wise Men made more than their  share of mistakes,&quot; including the Berlin crisis and blockade, China,  and the Korean War.  That is fair.  The error of McCarthy and his  supporters was the lurid deduction that these mistakes evidenced a  widespread Communist conspiracy within the federal government.  For  McCarthy, at the very least, the policymaking elites were not taking the  international-communist threat seriously enough.  According to Herman,  McCarthy believed &quot;[t]here were those who were soft on issues like  communism, and those who were not,&quot; which &quot;was reflected in  McCarthy's fight against the `silk handkerchief liberals' who frustrated  his efforts to ferret out Communists in government.&quot;  McCarthy  obviously seethed with class resentment.  McCarthy's anti-State Department  campaign began in November 1949, when he accused it of being  &quot;honey-combed and run by Communists.&quot;  On February 9, 1950, in  Wheeling, West Virginia, McCarthy gave his now-famous speech, declaring:  &quot;I have here in my hand a list of 205 - a list of names that were made  known tp the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and  who nevertheless are still working for and shaping policy in the State  Department.&quot;  In the ensuing controversy, McCarthy insisted that he  had &quot;the names of 57 people identified as Communists and security  threats in the State Department.&quot;  Herman acknowledges that the  &quot;confusion McCarthy fostered over whether he was talking about 205  Communists, or 57...gave birth to his reputation for recklessness,  obfuscation, and untruth.&quot;  On February 20, &quot;McCarthy went to the  Senate floor to deliver a formal denunciation of the State Department's  security program.&quot;  The six-hour speech created a furor.  Herman  bluntly acknowledges that &quot;McCarthy found himself on very shaky  ground&quot; in claiming that &quot;he had found a cabal of Communists in  the State Department,&quot;and &quot;the bald truth was that McCarthy did  distort several [`bald summaries' of an investigation of security risks at  the State Department] in order to make his point.&quot;  Nevertheless,  McCarthy ran rampant for the next three years.  Hoever, beginning in early  1953, according to Herman, McCarthy &quot;had a long spell of choosing poor  targets for his public anti- Communist campaigns, each of which served only  to antagonize the White House and even fellow Republicans.&quot;  By the  end of 1954, McCarthy was finished, and after the Senate voted 67-22 to  &quot;condemn&quot; him, McCarthy became &quot;an institutional  pariah.&quot;  The sociology of McCarthy's support has been long debated.   Herman rejects the theory that the McCarthyite core came from &quot;`a  coalition of the aggrieved,' men and women who had never come to terms with  the world created by the New Deal or World War II.&quot;  Herman writes  that McCarthy's supporters, &quot;[f]ar from being aggrieved or  resentful...had found fresh opportunities and prosperity in postwar  America,&quot; and &quot;were anxious about whether those opportunities  could continue and what America's future would be if Communists and their  sympathizers were allowed to dominate the world outside.&quot;  If  McCarthyism was revolutionary, in this view, it was a revolution of rising  expectations.  Herman explains that McCarthy's core was in the rural  midwest, the south, and ethnic neighborhoods in northeastern cities.   According to Herman, &quot;American Catholics were more inclined to support  McCarthy than any other group,&quot; because many Catholics felt that  &quot;anticommunism was their issue.&quot;  <br />In my opinion, this is the  ultimate issue: Did McCarthy act in good faith.  If McCarthy had an  objectively honest belief that the Truman administration was insufficiently  concerned about internal security, especially in federal government  agencies, some of McCarthy's excesses - such as what Herman refers to as  the &quot;crude mishandling of sensitive information&quot; - might be  excused.  But, if McCarthy recklessly or intentionally disregarded the  truth, he deserves  history's judgment as &quot;America's most hated  senator.&quot;  Herman's &quot;reexamination&quot; of McCarthy is carefully  researched and extensively annotated, but most of the sources are  secondary, so there is practically nothing new here.  Readers sympathetic  to McCarthy, or at least to the possibility there was a genuine internal  threat to national security in the early 1950s, may be convinced by  Herman's argument.  I was not.	2000-06-25
US	50862643	R1ZS59PMZD8K3Y	0871137992	932629936	The Perfect War: Technowar in Vietnam (Military History Series)	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Flawed Concepts for a &quot;Perfect War&quot;	In preparation for and during the era of the Vietnam War, according to sociologist James  William Gibson, the United States developed what he calls &quot;Technowar,&quot; a series of concepts in which war was waged  &quot;as a kind of high-technology, capital-intensive production  process.&quot;  But Gibson argues that even overwhelming military force  could not produce solutions to political problems.  Summaring the  experience of Vietnam, Gibson writes: &quot;It should be amply clear that  Technowar has the capacity to destroy, but it cannot persuade political  leaders and entire societies to simply give up and submit to American  will.&quot;  This was a disastrous, perhaps fatal, flaw in the United  States' approach to this conflict and largely explains why the U.S. lost  the Vietnam War without being beaten on the battlefield.<br />Gibson writes  that the United States should have learned from France's defeat in its  Indochina War in the early 1950s, in spite of massive infusions of American  aid, that &quot;[w]hat the Vietminh had lacked in techno-capital they made  up for by mobilizing people.&quot;  However, Gibson quotes Henry Kissinger  that,&quot;since 1945, American foreign policy has been based `on the  assumption that technology plus managerial skill gave us the ability to  reshape the international system.&quot;  According to Gibson, Kissinger  devised a strategic doctrine in which, &quot;[b]y virtue of its  technological production system, the United States [could] achieve its  foreign-policy objectives by limited wars fought as wars of  attrition.&quot; <br />John Kennedy, the first president born in the  20th-century, and his advisors naturally embraced the ideas that became  Technowar: &quot;With the appointment of Robert S. McNamara as secretary of  defense in 1961, the `managerial' approach to warfare soon permeated the  entire military apparatus.&quot;  Vietnam served, Gibson writes, as  &quot;the laboratory for weapons development and militaryscience.&quot;   According to Gibson, a &quot;deep belief in technology [characterized] the  war-managers' approaches to virtually all questions,&quot; and   &quot;United States military officers conceived of themselves as business  managers rather than combat leaders.&quot;  Gibson quotes one of Gen.  William Westmoreland's principal subordinates that the Vietnam War  &quot;was comparable to an assembly line.&quot;  Gibson asserts that  &quot;[a] great many soldiers...saw war-managers as directly responsible  for their deaths.  Management did not care whether labor lived or died,  only about producing a high enemy body count.&quot;  Gibson explains that  &quot;middle-management officers used their troops as the human `bait'  called for in Technowar strategy.&quot;  According to Gibson:  &quot;Enlisted men were seen as a kind of migrant labor force of only  marginal importance.  They were marginal in that artillery, jet  fighter-bombers, and helicopters were official responsible for producing  enemy deaths, while infantry and armored cavalry became the `fixing  force.'&quot;  According to Gibson: &quot;War-manager pressures for high  body counts led to both systematic falsification of battle reports, routine  violation of the rules of engagement and regulations covering treatment of  prisoners, and systematic slaughter of Vietnamese noncombatants.&quot;   According to Gibson, the &quot;massive killing of civilians drove  Vietnamese toward the Vietcong.&quot;  Nevertheless, according to Gibson,  American leaders believed they were invincible: &quot;Technowar must  produce victory.&quot;  In August 1966, a report prepared by an American  civilian official in Vietnam stated: &quot;Wastefully, expensively, but  nonetheless indisputably, we are winning the war in the South....[O]ur side  now has in presently programmed levels all the men, money and other  resources needed to achieve success.&quot;  According to Gibson, American  leaders &quot;believed they had beaten theVietcong by the autumn of 1967,  &quot; so the Tet offensive, which began on January 31, 1968, &quot;came as  a surprise.&quot;  In early 1969, National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger  asked the Rand Corporation to prepare a list of policy options for Vietnam.   Daniel Ellsberg, then a Rand employee, prepared the list, which did not  include any U.S. action leading to victory.  When Kissinger asked why,  Ellsberg responded: &quot;I don't believe there is a win option in  Vietnam.&quot;  According to Gibson: &quot;Many crucial studies  demonstrating Technowar failure...came to the attention of leading  war-managers&quot; in 1968 and 1969.  Gibson asserts that, by this time,  the war-managers had created &quot;a double-reality: a war at ground level  and a much different paper edifice for Saigon and Washington  headquarters.&quot;  Gibson explains: &quot;The idea of low-tech peasants  either defeating or offering major support to the most advanced  technological power on earth was unthinkable to Americans.&quot;  In his  chapter on the Tet offensive, Gibson goes into what appeared to be a long  digression concerning racial and class conflict in the U.S. military in  Vietnam.  At first, I failed to see how it was relevant to Gibson's main  premise, Technowar.  But Gibson then made the point that, during the  Vietnam War, &quot;class conflict between `working-class' grunts and  war-managers centered on the soldiers' unwillingness to die for the  war-managers.  For some soldiers, Vietnam duty became a deeply radicalizing  experience.  Such men later founded Vietnam Veterans Against the War in  Vietnam.&quot;  <br />Today, twenty-five years after Saigon fell in the spring  of 1975, with the United States and Vietnam moving toward reconciliation,  one might ask: What difference does it make?  The answer, of course, is  that Technowar did not expire when the final helicopter left Saigon.  The  United States has, to borrow Gibson's term &quot;reproduced &quot;  Technowaron several occasions since then.  For instance, according to  Gibson: &quot;The 1991 war against Iraq at first seemed like a complete  validation of Technowar - images of advanced technological weapons in  action dominated reporting.&quot;  Gibson writes than Technowar killed  &quot;Iraqi troops by the thousands, and bombing destroyed the industrial  infrastructure of Iraq.  But the Iraqi political and military regime  remained intact.&quot;  More recently, NATO's air war against Serbia caused  great destruction without dislodging President Slobodan Milosevic and his  band of thugs.  Whether one believes that the Vietnam War was a noble cause  or the most tragic episode in American history since the Civil War, it  never was &quot;The Perfect War.&quot;  We must learn its lessons or we  will be condemned to repeat its errors.  This book is not the final word on  the Vietnam War, but it is a provocative interpretation.	2000-06-18

According to Appy, &quot;2.5 million young American enlisted men&quot; served in Vietnam, and &quot;[r]oughly 80 percent came from working-class and poor backgrounds.&quot; It is Appy's view that &quot;[c]lass, not geography, was the crucial factor in determining which Americans fought in Vietnam.&quot; Appy goes on to state: &quot;Vietnam, more than any other American war in the twentieth century, perhaps in our history, was a working-class war.&quot; That is a provocative thesis.<br />In the introduction, which is centered on the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., and the 58,191 names inscribed on the wall, Appy asks: &quot;What sorts of people were they?  How did they come to fight in Vietnam?&quot; According to Appy: &quot;[T]hose who fought and died in Vietnam were overwhelmingly drawn from the bottom half of the American social structure.&quot; Appy explains that &quot;[p]oor and working-class soldiers, whether black or white, were more likely to be trained for combat than were soldiers economically and educationally more advantaged.&quot; In particular, Appy examines a white, working-class section of Boston, about which he writes that &quot;boys who grew up in Dorchester were four times more likely to die in Vietnam than those raised in the fancy suburbs.&quot; Appy also identifies East Los Angeles and the South Side of Chicago as &quot;major urban centers...[which] sent thousands of men to Vietnam,&quot;as did Saginaw, Michigan; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Stockton, California; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Youngstown, Ohio; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; and Utica, New York.  These facts are compelling.  So is the poignance of the bitterness which resulted.  For instance, Appy quotes a firefighter who lost a son in Vietnam: &quot;I'm bitter.  You bet your goddamn dollar I'm bitter.  It's people like us who gave up our sons for the country.&quot; If Appy had proceeded to develop these points and to analyze their social consequences more fully, this would have been a marvelous book.  However, only Chapter 1, entitled &quot;Working-Class War,&quot; and Chapter 2, &quot;Life Before the Nam,&quot; are devoted to information and insights about the role of the working class and poor in this conflict.  According to Appy, most Vietnam-era draftees and volunteers &quot;had no real or attractive alternative&quot; to military service because &quot;[p]oor and working-class youth - those most likely to be drafted - were least able to secure stable, well-paying jobs,&quot; in the mid-1960s, and &quot;[c]ollege was not a realistic option for most working-class men.&quot; Appy also writes: &quot;The draft determined the social character of the armed forces by whom it exempted from service as well as by whom it actually conscripted or induced to enlist....From 1964 to 1973, 2.2 million men were drafted, 8.7 million enlisted, and 16 million did not serve.&quot; According to Appy: &quot;The student deferment was the most overtly class-biased feature of the Vietnam era draft system.&quot; For instance, according to Appy, &quot;working-class men saw military service as a natural, essentially unavoidable part of life, one they believed would at least maintain their social and economic standing, whereas &quot;men from wealthier families were likely to view the military as an agent of downward social mobility.&quot; Appy argues that &quot;the fundamental factors moving people into the military were economic and institutional.&quot; According to Appy, many working-class men enlisted during the Vietnam War-era because, &quot;[w]ith the prospect of a dead-end job, little if any chance for college, and the draft looming on the horizon,&quot; most &quot;saw enlistment as a way of `getting over' the unavoidable.&quot; Appyproceeds to explain that &quot;white, working-class men did not regard military service as an opportunity so much as a necessity (nothing else to do, draft pressure, duty, job security) so much as a necessity (nothing else to do, get away, leave school).&quot; He adds: &quot;For black volunteers, economic and social improvement often were decisive motivations.&quot; These facts and analysis are invaluable.  Much of what follows, however, is familiar, and some of it is, frankly, tedious.  Appy spends seven chapters answering these questions: &quot;What was the nature of the war they waged?  How did [the working-class and poor soldiers] respond?&quot; For instance, Appy devotes several pages to the hazing and physical abuse which were typical of Vietnam-era Marine Corps basic training, but we're already familiar with this from a dozen books and movies.  Similarly, virtually all readers, other than newcomers to the literature of the Vietnam War, know: &quot;Attrition was the central American strategy; search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress.&quot; I do not mean to suggest that Appy's insights are inaccurate.  He writes, for instance: &quot;For soldiers, war is a directly confronted reality, not a theoretical abstraction,&quot; and &quot;[s]oldiers in Vietnam were preoccupied with survival.&quot; But those observations lack the sharp focus on working-class and poor military men in Vietnam which I had expected.  And, when Appy does focus on working-class and poor military men, much of this book is anecdotal, drawn from interviews the author conducted between 1981 and 1987 with approximately 100 Vietnam veterans.  In my mind, there is a genuine issue as to whether this is a sufficiently large sample from which to draw conclusions.<br />The introduction and first two chapters of this book are superb, but I was disappointed by much of the rest of it.

US	50862643	R3RWPB1H65W5LT	0674002253	288929585	American Tragedy: Kennedy, Johnson, and the Origins of the Vietnam War	Books	5	28	32	N	N	Vietnam in the Cold War Context	David E. Kaiser, American Tragedy : Kennedy, Johnson, and the Origins of the Vietnam War (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000)<br />As the Vietnam War recedes into history, debate over its causes and conduct  continues.  In this massive, authoritative study of the war's origins,  David Kaiser asserts that Dwight Eisenhower initiated policies calling for  military responses to Communist aggression in Southeast Asia, and John  Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, although they may have questioned these  policies, never changed them.  Kennedy was reluctant to commit American  ground forces in Vietnam.  In contrast, Johnson was determined to confront  North Vietnam, and the war began in earnest early in 1965, when the bombing  campaign commenced and ground forces were introduced. <br />Kaiser offers the  provocative theses that the war was the work of the &quot;GI  generation,&quot; a term he borrows from William Strauss and Neil Howe's  1991 book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069, for  men born between 1901 and 1924 who lived through the Great Depression and  then did most of the fighting during World War II.  According to Kaiser,  the &quot;strengths&quot; of the GI generation included a &quot;willingness  to tackle tough and costly tasks, a faith in the institutions of the  government of the United States, a great capacity for teamwork and  consensus, and a relentless optimism,&quot; and its weaknesses included  &quot;an unwillingness to question basic assumptions, or even to admit the  possibility of failure, or to understand that the rest of the American  population was less inclined to favor struggle and sacrifice for their own  stake.&quot;  Kennedy and Johnson, most of their senior civilian advisers,  and all of the Joint Chiefs, belonged to the GI generation, and they  &quot;almost unquestionably accepted the need to resist Communist expansion  wherever it took place.&quot;  Nevertheless, the Kennedy administration  never agreed aboutpolicy in Vietnam.  According to Kaiser, throughout most  of 1961, Kennedy &quot;resisted the bureaucracy's repeated calls for  full-scale American military intervention in Southeast Asia.&quot;  Events  in1962 made intervention more certain, and the Pentagon began planning  &quot;to defeat the Viet Cong...with conventional military  operations.&quot;  But, by that time, President Kennedy was increasingly  reliant on State Department official Roger Hillsman, who believed that  &quot;[c]onventional military tactics were ineffective against  guerrillas.&quot;  Ngo Dinh Diem's government in South Vietnam also posed  serious problems.  The regime received significant American aid, and its  army was wholly financed by the United States, but &quot;Diem never showed  the slightest tendency to follow American advice.&quot;  To the contrary,  Diem relied upon his widely-hated brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. In late 1961, when  the U.S. proposed &quot;fundamental changes in the operation of Diem's  government and army in order to win the struggle against the  Communists,&quot; Diem resisted.  Coup rumors circulated for the next two  years.  Kaiser provides a lengthy, detailed narrative of the  administration's relationship to Diem's demise.  In June 1963, longstanding  Buddhist opposition to the regime erupted into a full-scale crisis, and  this &quot;ultimately led to the overthrow and assassination of Diem.&quot;   Until then, according to Kaiser, &quot;President Kennedy generally stayed  out of the details of Vietnam policy,&quot; but, the situation in South  Vietnam began &quot;to require attention at the highest levels.&quot;  By  August, The New York Times reported that &quot;the United States has almost  openly been advocating a military coup,&quot; but what Kennedy &quot;feared  more than anything, from August through October, was an American-sponsored  coup that failed.&quot;  American ambivalence, sometimes encouraging the  plotters, sometimes showing disdain, was inexcusable.  Nowhere in this  country's history is there a more shameful record of the U.S. maneuvering  to undermine an ostensibly friendly government. According to Kaiser,  &quot;the four key men who led the United States into the Vietnam War&quot;  were Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert  McNamara, and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy.  Kaiser writes that  &quot;Johnson, McNamara, and Rusk - with Bundy's general support - had  forged a personal bond around the cause of the war in South Vietnam.&quot;  Kaiser's indictments are hard, if not harsh.  Johnson never evinced  &quot;interest in any long-term alternative to escalation.&quot;  The  President later told Bundy, &quot;I don't think [Vietnam is] worth fighting  for,&quot; but Johnson seemed to believe that the United States could not  get out without a substantial loss of face.  Rusk &quot;clung to his  version of the lesson of the 1930s: that firmness alone could deter  Communist aggression anywhere around the world.&quot;   According to  Kaiser, &quot;[t]he mystique that built up around McNamara should not  obscure the essence of his role: implementing other men's plans, in pursuit  of other men's objectives,&quot; and &quot;McNamara lacked the ability, or  perhaps even the intention, to change the manner in which the U.S. Army  planned to fight this war.&quot; And, in May 1964, Bundy told Johnson that  &quot;the US cannot tolerate the loss of Southeast Asia to Communism.&quot;   Kaiser makes clear that Kennedy and Johnson missed several opportunities  to disengage from Vietnam.  In November 1961, John Kenneth Galbraith,  Kennedy's ambassador to India, visited Saigon, and, after reporting that  &quot;Diem's political intransigence was probably the biggest source&quot;  of South Vietnam's problems, Galbraith suggested that &quot;the United  States would eventually have to dump&quot; Diem.  In August 1963, Mike  Mansfield, the Senate Majority Leader and an expert on Asia, confidentially  advised Kennedy that &quot;the United States should reserve the right to  withdraw its assistance should the Saigon government prove incapable of  making use of it.&quot;  In March 1965, Walter Lippmann wrote that South  Vietnam was not a vital American interest.  And, during a 1965 meeting with  President Johnson, Clark Clifford argued, according to Kaiser, that, if the  U.S. did not get out of Vietnam, &quot;the alternative was a five-year,  50,000-casualty war that China and the Soviet Union would never allow the  United States to win.&quot;<br />According to Kaiser, &quot;[o]ne great irony  of the Vietnam war...is its essential lack of effect upon the Cold  War.&quot;  That is a startling conclusion, but it is essentially correct.   Kaiser's position is supported by the fact that the Cold War continued for  nearly 15 years after the fall of Saigon and then ended in favor of the  United States.  The war in Vietnam was, in every sense, an American  tragedy.	2000-06-07

But May makes a convincing case that &quot;the end of World War II brought  a new sense of crisis&quot; and that the postwar world was full of its own  stresses.  According to May, &quot;the freedom of modern life seemed to  undermine security.&quot;  As a result, from the late 1940s and well into  the 1960s, she writes that Americans &quot;wanted secure jobs, secure  homes, and secure marriages in a secure country.&quot;  In both its  international and domestic manifestations, according to May:  &quot;Containment was the key to security.&quot;  Indeed, in May's view:  &quot;With securityas the common thread, the cold war ideology and the  domestic revival reinforced each other.&quot;  According to May: &quot;The  ideological connections among early marriage, sexual containment, and  traditional gender roles merged in the context of the cold war,&quot; and  &quot;much of the postwar social science literature connected the functions  of the family directly to the cold war.&quot; According to May:  &quot;Strong families required two essential ingredients: sexual restraint  outside marriage and traditional gender roles in marriage.&quot;  May  writes: &quot;The sexual containment ideology was rooted in widely-accepted  gender roles that defined men as breadwinners and women as mothers.&quot;   It is critical to May's thesis that &quot;marriage itself symbolized a  refuge against danger.&quot;  According to May, most Americans believed  that &quot;a successful marriage depended on a committed partnership  between a successful breadwinner and his helpmate.&quot;That belief was  reinforced by a Cold War-era study funded by the Ford Foundation and  conducted by two Harvard sociologists which concluded that the key to  successful families &quot;was stable homes in which men and women adhered  to traditional gender roles.&quot;  It is clear that this conclusion was  not just descriptive; it was intended to be normative.     May explains the  postwar baby boom in these terms: &quot;Procreation in the cold war era  took on almost mythic proportions.&quot;  A large family offered the  possibility of escape: &quot;For men who were frustrated at work, for women  who were bored at home, and for both who were frustrated with the  unfulfilled promise of sexual excitement, children might fill the  void.&quot;  Furthermore, according to May, &quot;procreation was one way  to express civic values,&quot; and there was an &quot;intense and  widespread endorsement of...the positive value of having several  children.&quot;  May reports that, [t]he message in the public culture was  clear: motherhood was the ultimate fulfillment of female sexuality and the  primary source of a woman's identity.&quot;  In contrast, according to the  Cold War's conventional wisdom, &quot;[c]hildlessness was considered  deviant, selfish, and pitiable.&quot;  According to May, for white  middle-class couples, &quot;viable alternatives to domestic containment  were out of reach&quot; because the &quot;cold war consensus and the  pervasive atmosphere of anticommunism made personal experimentation...  risky endeavors.&quot;  But &quot;[m]ost seemed to agree that a  less-than-ideal marriage was much better than no marriage at all.&quot;   According to May, &quot;the popular literature was filled with articles  that warned of the evils of divorce,&quot; and a psychology professor  writing in Parents Magazine noted that &quot;the `delinquent' child comes  from a family where `the parents don't get along and that his home has been  or will be broken by separation, desertion or divorce.'&quot;  If  traditional gender roles and domesticity were prized, it is not surprising  that early Cold War society was Intolerant of deviation from sexual and  family norms.  According to May: &quot;The popular culture gave full play  to the fears of sex and communism running amok,&quot; and &quot;[t]he most  severe censure was reserved for gay men and lesbians.&quot;  She explains:  &quot;The persecution of homosexuals was the most blatant form of sexual  paranoia linking `perversion' to national weakness.&quot;  May also writes:  &quot;To escape the status of pariah, many gay men and lesbians locked  themselves in the stifling closet of conformity, hiding their sexual  identities and passing as heterosexuals.&quot;  In the &quot;Postscript to  the 1999 Edition,&quot; May added: &quot;With communism so widely feared  and linked in the public imagination to everything from domestic spies to  homosexuals, it is no wonder that evidence of non-conformity during the era  of containment appeared as a threat to the democracy itself.&quot;  She  proceeds to explain: &quot;Anticommunism gave a modicum of legitimacy to  the harassment of individuals whose sexuality did not conform to the norm;  `deviants' were persecuted in the name of national security.&quot;<br />In  summary, this book is an important contribution to the literature of the  effects of the Cold War on American society.  It is well-researched and  carefully reasoned, but it also is easy reading and should be of interest  to member of the baby-boom generation who want to know more about the world  in which they were raised.	2000-06-03

Murphy, Dak To: America's Sky Soldiers in South Vietnam's Central Highlands (1993, New York: Pocket Books edn., 1995)<br />The  appearance of this marvelous little book is deceptive.  Its pocket-book  format might suggest a brief regimental history or narrow personal account,  but author Edward Murphy's text is, in fact, a captivating and relatively  sophisticated narrative of the 173d Airborne Brigade's five-month campaign  in 1967 in the dense jungle of South Vietnam's Central Highlands.  The  fighting around a small hamlet called Dak To proved to be especially hard  for two reasons: the first concerned the physical conditions and the second  was in the nature of the enemy.  Daytime temperatures were in the upper  90s, with humidity in excess of 90 percent, and the moisture brought out  mosquitoes and leeches.  At times, it rained hard practically every day.   According to Murphy, &quot;frequently [the American paratroopers'] clothes  rotted in the damp jungle,&quot; so, about once a month, fresh fatigues  were delivered by supply helicopter to the field.  The jungle was so thick  that visibility often was limited to a few meters, and nearly every foot of  ground was covered by vegetation.  Sometimes the paratroopers had to carry  chain saws to cut through the jungle and to make landing zones for their  supply helicopters.  (It could take two hours of hard work to hack a  landing zone out of the jungle.)  Enlisted men carried their weapons,  ammunition, and personal gear on their backs in rucksacks which weighed  from 75 to 90 pounds.  During the rainy season, marching 1,000 meters  through the jungle in a day was considered &quot;good progress.&quot;  <br />The physical conditions often negated the United States' vast  superiority in weapons technology.  For instance, according to Murphy:  &quot;Artillery [could] be ineffective in the jungle...[because] shells  [had] the tendency to burst in the tops of tall trees, scattering shrapnel  harmlessly about.&quot; &quot;Too often, airstrikes and gunships could not  effectively penetrate the thick jungle canopy.&quot;  Furthermore,  according to Murphy: &quot;To prevent U.S. air strikes and artillery from  decimating its ranks, the [North Vietnamese and Viet Cong] `hugged' the Sky  Soldiers, closing to within ten to twenty meters of their perimeter.&quot;   In addition to the difficult conditions, and in contrast to the combat  farther south, which was mostly against Viet Cong irregulars, the  paratroopers, many of whom were still teenagers, battled elements of the  North Vietnamese Army, &quot;professionals who [knew] how to fight.&quot;   The fighting often was brutal.  One of the favored weapons of the North  Vietnamese was the RPG, a Soviet-manufactured antitank rocket used as an  antipersonnel weapon against American infantry.  Furthermore, there was  nothing chivalrous about the war at Dak To.  After one fierce firefight,  Murphy reports, a medical specialist &quot;could hear the wounded screaming  for mercy as the NVA walked among them, executing those paratroopers still  alive.&quot;  On another occasion, when the paratroopers returned to the  site of one battle to recover their dead, they found that  &quot;corpses  had been mutilated, their features destroyed, ring fingers cut off, and  ears removed.&quot;  Early in the book, Murphy writes that the &quot;173d  possessed great morale.  All its men were volunteers for airborne training  and most had volunteered for South Vietnam.&quot; During the Dak To  campaign, however, the paratroopers' frustrations mounted.  At one moment,  when a &quot;friendly&quot; artillery round landed too close for comfort to  an American captain, he grabbed his company's radio handset and screamed:  &quot;Send another round this way and I'll kill the son of a bitch who  fires it.&quot;  One of Murphy's clearest themes is the gradual erosion of  the paratroopers' confidence in their superior officers.  According to the  author, the generals' &quot;grand plans meant little to the average Sky  Soldier.  All he knew was that he was out in the boonies, humping day after  day in the monotonous mountains and valleys of the Central Highlands.&quot;   Furthermore, Murphy writes that when Gen. William Westmoreland, the  American commander in Vietnam, flew to Dak To on June 23, 1967 to talk with  the survivors of one fierce battle, &quot;You took on a tough NVA unit and  whipped their asses,&quot; a sergeant whispered to a buddy, &quot;Wonder  what he's been smoking?&quot;  Murphy offers many glimpses of the cruel  ironies and inequities of war.  In one instance, after a Marine jet dropped  a 500-lb. bomb directly on an aid station for wounded American paratrooper,  an American officer on the ground pleaded into a radio: &quot;No more  f------ planes.  Please no more planes.  You're killing us up here.  Stop  it.&quot;  The bomb wounded over 80 men badly enough to be brought to the  aid station, but nearly all the medics were dead.  Meanwhile, the pilot  returned &quot;to his base at Da Nang with its air-conditioned officers'  club, ice-cold beers, hot showers, and clean sheets,&quot; The ongoing  controversy about the accuracy of &quot;body counts&quot; is on display  here.  At one point during the Dak To campaign, when North Vietnamese dead  were reported as 1,644, Gen. Westmoreland stated in a press conference:  &quot;I think [the battle was] the beginning of a great defeat for the  enemy.&quot;  According to Murphy, however, &quot;these figures are  suspect,&quot;and the actual number probably was closer to 1,000.  (After  one battle, the 173d's after-action report stated that 513 NVA had been  killed even though the best estimate of men engaged in the battle was that  the number of enemy of killed in action actually was 50 to 75.)  <br />One  veteran master sergeant, who fought in three wars, told the Murphy that, in  25 years as a paratrooper, he had never seen anything approaching the death  and destruction at Dak To.  The author leaves no doubt about the  paratroopers' bravery or the 173d Airborne Brigade richly-deserved  reputation as one of the elite units of the United States' armed forces.   But the answer to the larger question - What were American fighting men  doing in the jungles of Vietnam in the first place? - remains unanswered.	2000-05-29
US	50862643	R2IAJNYXL94GUE	0312265115	339865797	The Coldest War: A Memoir of Korea	Books	4	65	67	N	N	One Marine's View of the Early Cold War	James Brady, The Coldest War: A Memoir of Korea (1990, New York: Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martin's Griffin edn., 2000)<br />This is a splendid little  book about what one American statesman characterized, quite accurately, as  &quot;a  sour little war.&quot;  The reasons are clear.  With the possible  exception of the Falkland Islands War, no other conflict in the second half  of the 20thcentury was fought over ground as consistently inhospitable as  the three-year struggle in barren, frigid Korea.  Author James Brady, who  served as a Marine lieutenant there, describes the essence of the problem  early in the book: &quot;Hard enough fighting a war; in Korea, the cold  could kill you.&quot;  And he invokes the horrors of combat in the First  World War and the Civil War when he makes this point: &quot;In some ways,  it wasn't a modern war at all, more like Flanders or the Somme or even the  Wilderness campaign.&quot;  Brady is a wonderful writer and creates  marvelous word pictures of the war.  Many operations took place after dark,  and he writes: &quot;The grenade, the knife, the shotgun, even the shovel  and the axe were the weapons of night patrols.&quot;  Brady also offers  telling observations about matters important and trivial, including fearing  the night as shells roared out &quot;very low and directly overhead,&quot;  feeling chagrined when he could not answer a colonel's question about the  location of two machine guns which he commanded, using a wooden ammunition  box as a toilet, urinating on his rifle to thaw it for firing, not changing  underwear for 46 days while &quot;on the line, living in holes,&quot; and  subsisting for weeks at a time on c-rations.  Nevertheless, according to  Brady: &quot;There was a purity about life on the line, a crude priesthood  of combat.&quot;  And he also remarks: &quot;When you weren't fighting, the  war was pretty good.&quot;  Readers may be offended by some of Brady's  recollection, including the incessant references to Koreans as  &quot;gooks&quot; (except when he visits a village and addresses the  inhabitants as &quot;our Korean brothers&quot;): The Korean bearers who  deliver supplies to the line are known by everyone as the &quot;gook  train,&quot; and the universal eating utensil manufactured from a shell  casing is known as a &quot;gook spoon.&quot;  Chinese soldiers always are  &quot;chinks.&quot;  However, I found Brady's honesty engaging, even when  it was politically incorrect. Brady's memoir is remarkably free of rancor,  and, in fact, he appears to have respected his adversaries.  Brady reports  that some of the one million Chinese engaged in the war had been fighting  continuously since the mid-1930s, first against the Japanese, then amongst  themselves in the civil war which preceded the victory of Mao Zedong's  Communists, and finally against the Republic of Korea, the United States,  and their Allies.

Brady's memoir is remarkably free of rancor,  and, in fact, he appears to have respected his adversaries.  Brady reports  that some of the one million Chinese engaged in the war had been fighting  continuously since the mid-1930s, first against the Japanese, then amongst  themselves in the civil war which preceded the victory of Mao Zedong's  Communists, and finally against the Republic of Korea, the United States,  and their Allies.

Sherry, In the Shadow of War: The United States Since the 1930s (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1995)<br /> The preface to Michael Sherry's massive study of the last seven decades of United States history begins with this ominous statement: &quot;Since the late 1930s, Americans  have lived under the shadow of war.&quot;  Sherry addresses many issues in  order to prove his point, and it will be impossible to address all of them  here.  As a result, I will focus on Sherry's main premise, that  &quot;militarization&quot; (which he defines as &quot;the process in which  civil society organizes itself for the production of violence&quot;) has  been the most important purpose of the United States' government since it  began preparing for World War II.  According to Sherry: &quot;This book  emphasizes war as an agent of and rationale for the nation's  transformation.&quot;<br /> In the broadest sense, what Sherry calls  &quot;militarization&quot; is a metaphor for large federal programs,  organized hierarchically and managed by massive bureaucracies.  Sherry  explains that &quot;war&quot; was used by practically every president as  figure of speech connoting &quot;federal action and presidential  leadership, since war was a supremely national enterprise.&quot;  For  example, Franklin Roosevelt invoked &quot;metaphors of war&quot; during the  domestic crisis of the early years of his presidency; Lyndon Johnson  &quot;declared `war' on countless problems at home and abroad,&quot; and  George Bush &quot;deployed the full arsenal of military metaphors when he  declared his drug war.&quot;  In some instances, of course, tough talk of  war was not figurative.  If the conflict in Korea had escalated into  general nuclear war, President Truman wrote in his diary that &quot;Moscow,  St. Petersburg, Mukden, Vladivostok, Peking, Shanghai, Port Arthur, Dairen,  Odessa, Stalingrad, and every manufacturing plant in China and the Soviet  Union would be eliminated.&quot;According to a phrase in a top-secret  American document, large parts of the Soviet Union's urban-industrial  infrastructure would have been turned into a &quot;smoking, radiating  ruin.&quot;  In 1965, Secretary of State Dean Rusk urged bombing North  Vietnam &quot;as a signal to Hanoi and Peiping that they themselves cannot  hope to succeed without a substantial escalation on their part, with all  the risks they would have to face.&quot;  Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay made  essentially the same point when he suggested threatening the North  Vietnamese that the United States would &quot;bomb them back into the Stone  Age.&quot;  Sherry is absolutely correct that &quot;America's civilian  leaders often pursued national security and embraced military values more  fervently than military officers.&quot;  In 1950, for example, Secretary of  State Dean Acheson directed Paul Nitze to draft the document which became  known as known as &quot;NSC-68,&quot; which recommended increasing the  defense budget by a factor of nearly three, to $35 billion per year.  The  influence of policymakers such as Nelson Rockefeller, Averell Harriman,  Robert Lovett, and John McCloy (and Sherry could have added many others)  during the early years of the Cold War is well known.  Sherry is correct  that they &quot;had a common background in eastern elite schools, law  firms, corporations, and government,&quot; and their &quot;shared  outlook&quot; did much to shape the United States' approach to the Cold  War.  David Halberstam described these men with wicked irony as the  &quot;best and the brightest.&quot;  As early as 1956, as Sherry notes,  sociologist C. Wright Mills called attention to this &quot;power  elite&quot; running a &quot;permanent war economy.&quot;  In the mid-1960s,  when the policy elite turn against the war, President Johnson fumed:  &quot;The establishment bastards have bailed out.&quot;  Sherry explains  the erosion of consensus this way: &quot;When American abundance seemed  almost limitless, as in the 1940s and 1950s, militarization had seemed  almost painlessly affordable, even economically beneficial, with both guns  and butter readily attainable.&quot;  He proceeds to explain:  &quot;America's war in Vietnam violated the tacit bargain which supported  the nation's militarization after 1945.  Militarization had been tolerated  as long as it seemed congruent with affluence and progress at home.&quot;   The end of the Vietnam War provided a lost opportunity to reverse the  forces of militarization, at least in international affairs.  According to  Sherry, Jimmy Carter's inaugural address, &quot;signaled his determination  to break from America's militarized past.&quot;  Sherry explains:  &quot;Carter succeeded better than most modern Presidents at managing the  affairs of state so as to keep the nation out of war.&quot;  According to  Sherry, Ronald Reagan had a &quot;well-deserved reputation as a Cold  Warrior, and his presidency may be best remembered in the popular  imagination for what Sherry describes as having &quot;restored national  security as America's supreme priority,&quot; but Sherry relies on Garry  Wills's incisive comment that, in fact, Reagan's &quot;greatest  achievements and his political successes&quot; rested in his &quot;shrewd  concentration on domestic policy.&quot;  Sherry quotes John Newhouse that  Reagan had the &quot;good luck&quot; never to have &quot;to confront a  foreign policy crisis.&quot;  George Bush, according to Sherry, &quot;like  Nixon, lacked any vision for the nation out of the grooves cut by decades  of hot and cold war.&quot;  Sherry proceeds to explain: &quot;By  temperament cautious and by experience a Cold Warrior, Bush was not going  to rock the conservative boat by... advancing a new agenda.&quot;  Indeed,  according to Sherry, President Bush's chief of staff John Sununu believed  that a &quot;short successful war...would guarantee his reelection.&quot;   The Gulf War proved to bea superb showcase to &quot;display anew America's  superior technology,&quot; but, according to Sherry, &quot;the Gulf War  served Bush's fortunes badly and his other goals at best partially&quot;  because, as Bush himself acknowledged, there was no &quot;definitive  end&quot; to the conflict.  Sherry concludes: &quot;The Cold War's end did  not halt militarization,...but it did destroy the most prominent rationale  for militarization.&quot;    <br /> I am not entirely persuaded by  Sherry's assertion that &quot;militarization reshaped every realm of  American life - politics and foreign policy, economics and technology,  culture and social relations - making America a profoundly different  nation.&quot;  However, Sherry is absolutely correct that militarization  was an essential feature of the Cold War arms race and also facilitated the  vast extension of presidential leadership, operating through large federal  programs, on domestic policy issues.  In those respects, the shadow of war  had profound effects on the United States.	2000-05-25
US	50862643	R391AIY0X6QNXC	0393305589	898069939	Style in History	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Gibbon, Ranke, Macaulay, and Burckhardt: Stylish Historians	Peter Gay Style in History (1974, New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., paperback edn., 1988) <br /> Peter Gay is one of our preeminent authorities about cultural history, and professionals historians in all fields can learn much from both the substance and style of his oeuvre.  In particular, this thin book, principally essays about the style of four renowned historians of earlier times - Edward Gibbon (1737-94), Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-59), and Jacob Burckhardt (1818-97) - is a treasury of observations about the historian's craft.  According to Gay, &quot;style&quot; means both the literary devices employed by the historian, as well as his or her &quot;tone of voice.&quot; Gay addresses both, and more, while cautioning that the historian is &quot;under pressure to become a stylist while remaining a scientist.&quot;<br /> The back cover states that this book is a &quot;guide to the proper reading of Gibbon, Ranke, Macaulay, and Burckhardt,&quot; but I found it more descriptive than prescriptive. Indeed, Gay expressly intended these essays to stimulate &quot;debate over the definition of history.&quot; According to Gay, style is a function of both nature and nurture.  It is &quot;in part a gift of talent,&quot; but it also can be learned.  For the aspiring historian who looks to Gay's four masters for guidance, many of his observations are profound.  For instance, in discussing the belief of both Gibbon and Tacitus, the Roman historian who was one of Gibbon's principal sources, that &quot;the supreme task of the historian [is] to probe historical actors to their depth,&quot; Gay concludes: &quot;The chief use of the historian's penetration...[is] to dig beneath appearance to reality.&quot; Gay reports that Gibbon imagined himself, like Tacitus, to be a philosophical historian.  (Gibbon believed that &quot;the philosopher is a man who has conquered prejudices and given the critical spirit free play.&quot;) With regard to style, Gibbon employed a large arsenal of literary device, and Gay praises him for using irony, observing that, in Gibbon's writing, &quot;gravity and levity coexisted without strain.&quot; Gay describes as &quot;stunning&quot; the economy with which Ranke wrote and praises his gifts of &quot;speed, color, variety, freshness of diction, and superb control.&quot; According to Gay, Ranke believed that &quot;self-imposed discipline alone brings excellence to all art.&quot; For instance, the one-sentence paragraph was one of Ranke's trademarks.  Ranke is often credited with being the father of &quot;scientific history,&quot; but, as Gay notes, Ranke approached his craft &quot;as a branch of the storytelling art.&quot; In championing scientific history, Ranke extolled &quot;the systematizing of research, the withdrawal of ego from presentation, the unremitting effort of objectivity, the submission of results to critical public scrutiny.&quot; Indeed, according to Gay: &quot;Ranke's contribution to historical science...lay in his exalted view of documents.&quot; Furthermore, Gay offers the insight that Ranke &quot;recognized that history is a progressive discipline.&quot; Ranke claimed &quot;his own work was superior to that of his predecessors,&quot; but he also recognized that his greatest achievements eventually would be superseded by more modern scholarship.  In contrast to Ranke's economic style, Gay subtitles his chapter on Macaulay &quot;Intellectual Voluptuary&quot; (borrowing the phrase from Macaulay, himself).  Gay reports that Macaulay has been criticized as &quot;verbose, artificial, and overemphatic,&quot; and Gay acknowledges other faults including &quot;rhetorical self-indulgence,&quot; and &quot;a failure of restraint and of taste.&quot; But these criticisms did not prevent Macaulay from becoming a member of &quot;England's intellectual aristocracy.&quot; According to Gay, expansiveness and anxiety were the &quot;essential qualities that make up Macaulay's temper andinform Macaulay's style.&quot; In discussing Burckhardt, Gay notes that the &quot;historian's choice of subject...is a deeply emotional affair.&quot; According to Gay, in Burckhardt's masterpiece, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, his &quot;personal voice is...highly audible and wholly apologetic,&quot; and his judgments are &quot;cool.&quot; Gay notes that The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy is a &quot;work of diligent research and meticulous construction.&quot; Burckhardt's used irony sparingly in comparison with Gbbon, but Burckhardt's the section entitled &quot;The State as a Work of Art,&quot; is, as Gay observes correctly, in fact &quot;an animated chamber of horrors.&quot; For Burckhardt, Gay concludes: &quot;Style...is the bridge to substance.&quot; To Burckhardt, according to Gay, poetry and history - as art and science - are &quot;allies, almost inseparable twins.&quot;<br /> This book is not, strictly speaking, comparative intellectual biography, but are there any similarities in the subjects of Gay's essays?  Gay defines &quot;modern times&quot; as beginning in the 1890s, and, of the four historians whose style he studies, three - Gibbon, Ranke, and Macaulay - died in the pre-modern era, and Burckhardt survived only into its first decade.  In addition, I must raise one additional issue: Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt were lifelong bachelors, and Ranke did not marry until he was 48.  Are we to view this as mere coincidence?  I don't think so.  As the author of a superb biography of Sigmund Freud, I am surprised that Gay did not devote at least a few lines of insight, in addition to his remark that Gibbon sought to hide a &quot;professional bachelor's conflicts,&quot; to the tantalizing fact that three of the four great historian-stylists he studies never married and the other was well into middle age when he did so. Gay clearly believes that style matters in the writing of history, but I believe at least one succinct rule is clear:When in doubt, leave the stylistic flourish out.  This leads me to this point: I cannot recommend Gay more enthusiastically because he is both a great historian and a wonderful stylist, which is remarkable for the fact that German, not English, was his native language.  As an introduction to his writings, I suggest Gay's My German Question : Growing Up in Nazi Berlin, in which moments of humor leaven penetrating personal recollections of coming of age early in the era of Hitler's tyranny. After Gay's memoirs, the general reader may want to tackle some of his scholarly books, such as the biographies of Mozart and Freud, his superb studies of the Enlightenment, or this wonderful book, Style in History.  And a few may even be motivated to read (or re-read) Gibbon, Ranke, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.	2000-05-22
US	50862643	R2W8NKG5CN1DXZ	0803292139	667485611	The Gathering of Zion: The Story of the Mormon Trail	Books	5	115	117	N	N	In Praise of the Mormon Pioneers	REVISED ONLINE REVIEW: Wallace Stegner The Gathering of Zion: The Story of the Mormon Trail (1964, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, Bison Books edn., 1992)<br /> Wallace Stegner is one of the United States'  most underappreciated men of letters. Born in Iowa, Stegner was raised and  spent his youth in North Dakota, Washington, Montana, Utah, and  Saskatchewan, and he lived most of his adult life in California.  His  knowledge of the American west was encylopedic, and he was a prolific  writer of stories and novels, such as Angle of Repose, which won the  Pulitzer Prize in 1971.  But, like Shelby Foote, the bard of the Civil War,  Stegner wrote both fiction and nonfiction, and their oeuvre proves that the  best popular history is informative, lively, and well written.<br /> In  The Gathering of Zion: The Story of the Mormon Trail, Stegner does not ask  the reader to accept Mormon theology or social doctrine, only to admire the  courage and fortitude of the church's pioneers.  After a mob in Carthage,  Illinois, killed Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, several thousand Mormons - as  Stegner puts it, a &quot;a whole people - grandparents, parents, children,  flocks and herds, household goods and gods&quot; - crossed the continent  from Nauvoo, Illinois, to what became Salt Lake City in 1846 and 1847 on  foot and in covered wagons under the most difficult conditions.  Most of  the book is devoted to recounting the travails of the Mormons, always  tired, often hungry, and constantly at the mercy of the elements.  The  logistical requirements of the Mormon migration were staggering.  In  September 1845, one Mormon elder estimated that, in order to outfit a  family of five, it needed a wagon, three oxen, two cows, two beef cattle,  three sheep, 1000 pounds of flour, 20 pounds of sugar, a rifle and  ammunition, and a tent with poles: a total weight of 2,700 pounds, and  3,285 families began the trek.  Once on the trail, climatic conditions,  natural obstacles, internal dissension, suspicious Native Americans,  wolves, snakes and other unfriendly fauna, and the fear of  &quot;contamination by Gentile&quot; pioneers were constant concerns.   Although written in 1964, this book anticipates the so-called &quot;new  history.&quot;  In a number of passages, Stegner's presents this delightful  paradox: although Mormon society was constitutionally patriarchal, and the  most-familiar figures in Mormon history are men, it was their women whom  the author praises most highly, describing them with obvious admiration as  &quot;incredible&quot; and &quot;capable, indefatigable,  unquestioning.&quot;  Some of the most heartbreaking moments of the Mormon  migration involved women.  For instance, a mother who lost a child three  days after its birth carries the tiny corpse all the way west so that it  can be blessed and buried by the priesthood.  And on another occasion, a  mother approaches a squatter's cabin to beg a few potatoes to make soup for  a dying child only to be rebuffed angrily by a woman who told her &quot;I  wouldn't give or sell a thing to one of you damned Mormons.&quot; It is  difficult to imagine the Mormon migration without the church's  extraordinary women.  Stegner clearly admires the Mormons, but he pulls few  punches in describing the foibles of their leaders.  Joseph Smith is  portrayed as charismatic and a visionary, but a bank he founded engaged in  unorthodox, if not fraudulent, business practices.  Furthermore, Stegner  suggests that Smith's revelation which led to the Mormons' doctrine of  polygamy may have been a pretext for the Prophet's energetic pursuit of  women.  And Brigham Young, brave, strong, and with a great gift for  command, was not averse to using blistering language when chastising his  followers. (According to Stegner, Brigham Young once said, &quot;he that  will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.&quot;)  Indeed,  Stegner writes that many of Young's Mormon contemporaries hated him but  also that &quot;he was an extraordinary leader.&quot;<br />          In  addition to being a vivid and skillfully-written story,  The Gathering of  Zion also is inspirational.  Stegner describes the survivors of the Mormon  migration as &quot;hard core, tested and tempered by tribulation and shared  hope, as tough and durable a people as this republic has ever  produced.&quot;   I cannot imagine anyone reading this book and then  disputing that conclusion.  Stegner, himself, provides the most compelling  reason for reading this book: &quot;The story of the Mormon Trial is the  story of people....&quot;  However unusual Mormon theology and social  organization may be, the story of their migration is full of universal  values.  The Mormons' mid-19th century achievements were essential  prerequisites to the American Century which followed.	2000-05-22

Today, he is virtually unknown to  the public and, I dare say, is rarely read even by professionals in his  field, American intellectual history.  What a difference 50 years makes in  the life of a historian's reputation and influence!          The  explanation may lie in part in a useful distinction, drawn early by Neil  Jumonville, professor of history at Florida State University, between  scholars, who write for professional audiences, and intellectuals, who  write for the general public.  Jumonville makes clear that Commager trained  to be a scholar but, notwithstanding long appointments at New York  University, Columbia University, and Amherst College, spent a good part of  his career practicing as an intellectual.  As a result, he was very popular  in his own time but had relatively little lasting influence on scholars in  his field. <br />     Jumonville takes Commager's life from birth to burial in  this wide-ranging and solid, if not entirely stimulating, biography.  The  ultimate issue for any biographer of Commager is: Why did he become passé,  even while he was still teaching and writing?  (Commager died at the age of  95 in 1998.)  Jumonville posits several explanations for Commager's quick  descent from national authority to obscurity.  The first is that much of  Commager's scholarly work had encyclopedic breadth but lacked analytic  depth; his opinions and judgments were  intuitional rather than carefully  deductive and simply have not withstood the test of time.  Second and not  unrelated, Commager clearly, if unconsciously, showed a preference for  being prolific rather than profound.  His insistence upon writing,  lecturing, and speaking to a large audience, largely for financial reasons,  enhanced his popularity but may have contributed to limiting the impact he  made onhis professional peers.  According to Jumonville: &quot;Commager as  a popularizer was not a major influence on the direction taken by  intellectual historians.&quot; Although Commager aspired to recognition for  a high level of scholarship, &quot;he was not a research scholar.&quot;   Commager preferred anecdotes, biographical sketches, and narrative over  searching analysis.  According to Jumonville: &quot;Many historians felt  [Commager's] work lacked appropriate sophistication.&quot;  Third, some  historians clearly resented the &quot;breezy manner&quot; in which Commager  wrote, although that was not necessarily a criticism.  Commager believed  that &quot;history is a branch of literature,&quot; and even critics of the  substance of his oeuvre tended to admire his style.  Fourth and finally, I  believe, is the fact that he lost his intellectual curiosity and ceased to  read his professional peers, which is an essential activity for scholars in  any field.        In the middle decades of the century, Commager was  nationally known as an activist in &quot;liberal Left politics.&quot;  In  particular, Commager was an outspoken foe of McCarthyism, and this brought  him into sustained conflict with conservative commentators.  (William F.  Buckley once inquired, puckishly if not maliciously, whether Commager's  middle name was a tribute to Stalin.  It was, instead, a family name.)   Later, Commager was an energetic critic of the Vietnam War, and he tended  to be sympathetic to the student protesters of the 1960s.  One of the  issues which Jumonville attempts to address is whether Commager was a  consistent Jeffersonian liberal.  In my opinion, Jumonville spends too much  time attempting to locate Commager along the liberal-conservative political  continuum, although, in fairness to the author, Commager spent a lot of  time thinking about it, too.  This exercise would be profitable if it were  necessary to explicate hidden biases, but Commager was an outspoken liberalin most senses of the mid-20th century use of that term.  Furthermore, it  also must be noted that, although Commager enjoyed engaging in public  discourse about contemporary issues, his scholarly books were not partisan.               Is professionalism in the writing of history inconsistent  with partisan advocacy in public discourse?  Or, as Jumonville puts, it:  Must there be a clear dividing line between &quot;the role of the historian  as a scholar and as an activist intellectual&quot;?  Commager's life  indicates that the answer is: Not necessarily.  But, in purely practical  terms, there may simply not be enough hours in the day to perform both  functions well.  Time magazine criticized one of Commager's books for  lacking in thoroughness and suggested that he was a dilettante.  That was  unfair, but the tendency to write and speak glibly, which punditry  requires, does not serve the scholar well because depth of insight is what  proves the professional historian's mettle.          Jumonville's  Commager is likeable, if somewhat eccentric.  When friends were invited to  his home to dine, his wife entertained them during the cocktail hour, while  Commager continued to work, and, when dinner was served, Commager joined  them for the meal and conversation, invariably with himself as chief  conversationalist.  Although he was an energetic teacher, he rarely learned  the names of his students.  And I especially enjoyed the anecdote during  which Commager was arguing with a colleague about the author of a line of  Scottish poetry; when Commager could not find the line in an anthology, he  concluded that the book was incomplete and tossed it out a window.              On the other hand, Jumonville's periodic discussion of Commager's  long friendship and correspondence with historian Allan Nevins is  interesting but not especially revealing.  And Jumonville's frequent  references to Commager's relations with the New York Intellectuals do  little, in my opinion, toadd to Jumonville's thesis.        Some  readers will not find this book very exciting.  But to the extent that  intellectual history is a spectator sport, it is more akin to golf than  football.  I believe this book is a major achievement, but I also suspect  that there still is room for another, more searching intellectual biography  of Commager, especially one which examines his scholarly output in greater  detail.  What I am suggesting may be the equivalent of &quot;inside the  Beltway&quot; political analysis, and, were he alive, Commager might object  to this narrow focus, but it is the standard by which every professional  historian is ultimately judged.	2000-05-11
US	50862643	RKLV1J83M507K	0807825255	537924821	To Lead the Free World: American Nationalism and the Cultural Roots of the Cold War	Books	4	15	17	N	N	&quot;Cold War As Culture War&quot;	Over a decade after the Berlin Wall was torn down, the Cold War continues to fascinate both scholars and members of the reading public.  David McCullough's biography of Harry Truman, which in part told of the modest  man from Missouri's fiesty determination to stand up to Soviet provocations  in the dangerous early years of the Cold War, was immensely popular in the  early 1990s, and Blind Man's Bluff by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew  with Annette Lawrence Drew, the fascinating story of Cold War submarine  spying, remains just a rung below the paperback nonfiction bestsellers list  published by The New York Times.  Scholars of American and Soviet culture  realize that understanding the origins of the Cold War remains vital to a  full appreciation of the titanic, 40-year military confrontation between  the United States and the Soviet Union, which was the dominant fact of the  history of the second half of the 20th century, and John Fousek's To Lead  the Free World: American Nationalism &amp; The Cultural Roots of the Cold  War is a splendid addition to this literature.<br />     In recent years,  American military missions have been sent to places as distant and diverse  as Lebanon and Kuwait, Granada, Somalia, and Kosovo, but we must remember  that avoiding foreign military commitments, especially outside the area  covered by the Monroe Doctrine, once was a central tenet of American  diplomatic policy, and that the U.S. stayed aloof after Japan and China  went to war in the mid-1930s and during the first two years of the Second  World War in Europe.  It has been said that American isolationism died at  Pearl Harbor, but Fousek, a historian and associate director of Rutgers  University's Center for Global Change and Governance, is correct that, in  August 1945, most Americans wanted to &quot;bring the boys home.&quot;<br />      Nevertheless, the United States had important global interests, if for no  other reason than to prevent another surprise attack.  It is central to  Fousek's thesis that the white, male, Protestant upper- and middle-class  elite created a globally-activist, anti-Soviet foreign policy.  He is  correct that the report presented to the National Security Council in early  1950 known as &quot;NSC-68,&quot; which Fousek characterizes as the  &quot;primal text of American nationalist globalism,&quot; was inspired by  Secretary of State Dean Acheson and written by Paul Nitze, both  card-carrying members of the Eastern establishment.  The reasons for the  public's support of the narrow, Manichean world view are less clear.  If,  as Fousek asserts, the ideology of Cold War had come to dominate public  life by 1950, it was not because of NSC-68, which remained classified for  many years.  The reason was more likely economic than strictly ideological.   The Second World War was, of course, a tremendous boon to the United  States' economy, and, according to Fousek, the United Auto Workers became  strong believers in American global responsibility.          Fousek  provides a lengthy discussion of the meaning of victory.  The obvious, but  narrow, goal of winning the war had attracted public consensus in the  United States.  But, according to Fousek, African Americans believed that  victory was meaningless unless it brought European colonialism and racial  injustice in the United States to an end.  The post-war wave of lynchings  demonstrated that some things had not changed at all.  Fousek devotes  considerable space to African Americans in the late 1940s to demonstrate  that, even in the moment of victory, American society remained divided  racially, economically, socially, and ideologically.         One of the  most appealing features of this book is a marvelous 12-page &quot;visual  essay&quot; demonstrating how corporate advertising and editorial cartoons  were illustrative of the widespread belief in the United States mission to  lead the free world.  My favorite is the Coca-Cola ad in which  bare-chested,&quot;battle-seasoned&quot; Seabees land on a Pacific island  and introduce the indigenous inhabitants to Coke, &quot;the happy symbol of  a friendly way of life.&quot;<br />     I would have liked Fousek to devote  more attention to American technological superiority from air power to  atomic weaponry as a source of the United States' confidence in the  immediate post-war period.  This necessarily would have led to a more  extensive discussion of the end of the United States' atomic-bomb monopoly  as an important Cold War turning point.  Nevertheless, this book will  establish itself as a standard text for courses covering the early years of  the Cold War.	2000-03-26
