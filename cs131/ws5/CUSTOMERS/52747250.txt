I gave this book a try because I was interested in its Jewish content.  After reading it, I was surprised to learn that this was the first graphic novel in book form and that Will Eisner was a pioneer in his field.      Eisner's drawings are  magnificent, and the book's content noteworthy and familiar.  I like the idea of taking everyday characters and telling a story with pictures and dialogue.  I especially like the tidbits of history that preceed each chapter and the amazing detail in the sketches of the tenement buildings and the scenery (especially the falling rain). Perhaps comics are not just for kids after all!	2005-10-10

In this novel, the author's beautiful writing brings alive his service as a soldier in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.  He shares closely-held fears, funny stories, horrible experiences, personal philosophies, and soldier-to-soldier conversations. It presents a good balance of wartime's bad and the ugly with the not-so-expected love and beauty. The author exquisitely expresses his universal ideas about war. Psychological realities of becoming, being, and having been a wartime soldier are keenly described.  <br /> <br />For some readers, the book presents itself as a collection of stories.  For me, it works well as a novel because it had me thinking of the author as the protagonist. As he recalls his youth, he remembers his call to the draft, his years of service in Viet Nam, his buddy's post war return to civilian life, and even a sweet love of his young childhood.  Although the time skips around, that is how our memories work--with no set chronology as to what we remember or in what order.  In remembering, our minds sometimes to turn fact into fiction and vice versa.  O'Brien uses this blend of fact and fiction to makes his war stories truly memorable.	2005-09-25

The author takes on the American fast food industry, most specifically MacDonald's, to show how American fast food is proliferating throughout the United States and the world. This is resulting in increasing numbers of people to suffer from obesity, diabetes, heart problems, liver disorders, and even death due to poor diet choices based heavily on a fast food diet.  <br /> <br />The book is fun to read, but can be horrifying at times. Some of the facts and figures might even cause you indigestion! The author, to prove his point, goes on a one-month \\"MacDonald's food only\\" diet. The results of his experiment are rather distressing. <br /> <br />I agree that fast food is not one of the better diet choices, but to name one corporation solely responsible for the ills of the entire world is generalization. It stands to reason that freshly prepared food that is locally grown and free of additives, pesticides, and genetic modification is what keeps people healthy. In my opinion, what is happening with McDonald's is what is happening with most large corporations throughout the world. The motivation behind these now global corporations is money and profit. An intelligent person should think about what food he needs and whom he is willing to pay for what he wants. He then needs to think about what nutritional value he is paying for. Cheapest and fastest is not necessarily the best. <br /> <br />This book is a very good start to getting people to think about this serious matter. The author's friendly, down-to-earth manner of addressing his target audience does get its attention. I especially like the last few chapters in which the author gives positive steps that people can take to improve their health by being more selective in the foods they buy and eat and how they can influence the food chioces of others. <br />	2005-09-16

The day ends, and he is lost in the sand dunes. In desperation, he agrees to assistance from another man who finds the entomologist shelter for the night. He is taken to a sand cliff from which he is lowered by rope ladder to a small house, partially covered by sand and inhabited by a lone woman. In the morning, the rope is gone but the woman remains.  <br /> <br />The story was terrifying and engrossing all at once. It had the essence of one person being alone, yet not being alone; disappearing and yet not disappearing. Thinking of a person placed in a captive situation, it made me question whether it would be better to remain aloof or to befriend a captor. Presenting just as many questions as answers, this book turned out to be an incredible mind trip. I kept on trying to figure out what it all meant, whether it was a metaphor for anything at all or just a bizarre tale meant for entertainment. It was a story, complete with perfectly situated pen-and-ink drawings, about the meaning of being held captive and containing sequences of events and scenery which made for surreal and fascinating reading.  <br />	2005-07-15

It is often not easy to be an immigrant in the United States.  The author looks back at her experiences as a recently arrived Iranian trying to feel comfortable in the American culture.  She highlights many of her most trying experiences by recalling them in a humorous way.  Her father is often a direct target of her humor as well. She does this with love and an understanding of how Americans and Irans interact.  The result is an easy-to-read, enlightening and riotously funny book.	2005-07-09

She opens with the horrible rape scene and follows with the  difficulty of falling back into step with life again in its aftermath.  Battered by flashbacks and lacking real support from her odd family, the author shares with her reading public the difficulty of returning to the semblance of a \\"normal\\" life when others knew more than they needed to know about her unfortunate situation.  <br /> <br />I'm very glad I gave this author a second chance.  I hated and could not finish her non-fiction book, The Lovely Bones, but I am mesmerized by Lucky.  The book is amazingly good. Some of the writing is so beautiful.  All of it is deeply felt and expressive of the author's deepest thoughts.  It must be very hard to bring these thoughts into words in a way in which the reader can feel what the author does.  In it, she really bares her soul. The message is so important  that I both started a bookray (book sharing opportunity) with it and gave it to my daughter (also a college student) to read.	2005-06-18

The author touches on many simple things of everyday life that make his life story unique and have affected his writing.  With his superb prose, he puts readers in his own situation thereby giving a sense of what it must have felt like to live the life of Amos Oz.  There are precious reminiscences, my favorite being his parents and himself on the one phone line from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv simply giving a weekly hello to relatives.  He relates his deep shame at having inadvertently harmed a young Arab boy, what it was like to celebrate the night of Israel's Independence, his experience of being ushered out of an auditorium after laughing at Menachem Begin's use of the word \\"to arm\\", how in awe he felt in the presence of David Ben Gurion, how he became aware of his own political leanings, and the difficulty of carving out his own place in kibbutz life. He also opened his soul in revealing the anguish of his mother's illness and the pain of her death.      I love Oz's writing.  It's very passionate, but often in an understated way.  This is a truly special book.  Enjoy it.	2005-06-11

He returns to the land of his birth by walking through a guarded opening in the wall of his city. In Faerie, he seeks to retrieve a fallen star and bring it home to his love because she said she'd consent to marry him if he did so. He finds the fallen star vastly different from what he imagined. Nevertheless, his quest is to bring the fallen star to his love back home and this is what he is determined to do.<br /><br />Stardust reads like a fairy tale for grownups with some of Neil Gaiman's humor thrown in to pepper it up. There are witches, fairies, and even a unicorn.  It's a light love story with a bit of enchantment. It's fine, but truthfully I prefer Gaiman's other books which are more thoughtful (American Gods) or more humorous (Neverwhere).	2005-04-04

Angst-ridden and unhappily married Jane Kramer helps her husband Leon run his family's discount furniture store on Rockville Pike in Rockville, Maryland. Coping is difficult for Jane as she tries at the same time to keep an eye on Delia (a store employee to whom she suspects her husband is attracted), supervise her 16-year-old Goth son who was just suspended from school, and assist fellow soccer-mom Tiffany in running a scrapbooking business.  <br /> <br />At the same time, a mystery ensues. Money is disappearing from the store's funds. Who could possibly be taking it? It's not as simple as it sounds.  <br /> <br />How Jane deals with all of these problems makes for one hilarious read. The author's hard-hitting, sarcastic humor is timed just right to provide a truly laugh-out loud reading experience.  <br /> <br />I absolutely loved the Rockville setting since this city is my hometown. The author did a fantastic job of bringing some true-to-life local color into this story. She used not only the quirky character of the city but also references to F. Scott Fitzgerald who is buried here in Rockville.  <br /> <br />Rockville Pike is a fun story with very interesting characters, many of whom you'll be sure not to forget. This is an excellent novel for everyone. No, you do not need to live near Rockville Pike to really enjoy it. I highly recommend it for everyone who likes to laugh.	2005-03-24

I love this collection of stories!   <br /> <br />My favorites were \\"Farangs\\" and \\"Sightseeing.\\" In \\"Farangs\\", the author describes how a young Thai man's attraction to a female American tourist (a farang or foreigner) materializes despite his mother's unhappiness over the situation.   It's a look at how different cultures between a man and a woman can both attract and repel.  \\"Sightseeing\\" is a story in which a young man takes his mother on a vacation trip after learning a startling fact about her health.   <br /> <br />The \\"Cockfighter\\" is the longest story of the collection and the one I liked the least. It's the story of a young Thai girl's watching her dad's success at cockfighting diminish due to a powerful young adversary.  I feel that the author does better work when writing in the male voice. <br /> <br />These stories are colorful narratives of young Thai people in their own country but told in a way in which someone from the West can clearly relate. They exude tension, uncertainty, humor, and a genuine feel for dynamics of interpersonal relationships.  All of the stories give the feeling of real people in challenging situations.  With his fresh, sharp writing, the author gives everyone a most delightful reading experience. <br /> <br />Bravo to this new author on his debut book!   <br />	2005-03-24

On his boat Spray, the fisherman explains to his guest the habits of bluefish, fishing tips, species of native flora and fuana, problems with invasion of non-native species of sea-plants, and chemical pollution. After each fishing trip, they both go back to the fisherman's house where the fisherman's wife prepares a different fish dinner (with recipes included for the reader). Each chapter of this book is followed by a fish-related poem, most of which are too dense for me to enoy.    For people who love fishing, this is a great little book.  It offers new insights into a sport we love.  The pace of the book is slow, though.  For an action-packed adventure, this is not the book to read.  However, it does contain a wealth of information.  It's the perfect book to leave cozily tucked away for visitors of a beach cottage to find.	2005-03-16

It's predestined...and in Grace Wilmot's red leather diary.  Grace has one son, Peter, who meets his wife Misty Marie in art school.  Peter makes a living as a carpenter. During the course of his contracted jobs, he seals one room in each house and inscribes bizarre messages on its walls.  When homeowners discover that they are missing a room, lawsuits start pouring in. Misty is called to investigate and take responsibility. Peter cannot respond to these calls because he lies in a hospital bed in a vegetative state...the seeming result of a suicide attempt gone wrong. <br /> <br />The author gives us a very convoluted plot with many twists and turns. At times, it's not always so clear what is happening.  This is part of the mystery of the story.   The book reads like a horror novel with rhythm. Because the story is so quick-moving and the writing so colorful and creative, it is a (chilling) pleasure to read.   Be prepared to be entertained and disgusted at the same time.	2005-03-04

Tomas, a doctor turned window washer, very much in love with his wife Tereza, cannot help but find interest in other women, particularly the intriguing Sabina.  Tomas and Tereza, leave Czechslovakia when the Russians overtake their country but feel the need to return both for different reasons. <br /> <br />It is so hard to read this book.  It reminds me of the saying of \\"You're damned if you do and damned if you don't\\".   I believe the lovers' story is a statement of how people fit into society.  There is no right or wrong, but simply how a situation is seen in place and time.  The story is very cleverly done.  However, it was difficult for me to follow because the story line jumps all over the place with philosophical and political ideas woven throughout.  For someone who likes to read stories on different levels, this is a great choice.  For me, it was tough going.  I decided to continue through to the end and was glad I did.  Near the end of the book, I became interested in the historical background of the story and took some time to read more about it elsewhere.  I also liked reading about the relationship between Tereza and her dog.  It was very touching.	2005-02-20

In alternate chapters, the professor recalls his relationship with his wife as well as the steps he takes to learn from his dog Lorelei why his wife died.  He feels that, since his was dog present at the time of Lexy's death, the answer to his question is going to be revealed by teaching his dog to talk.     I enjoyed reading this book very much. Just as my husband said I would, I did cry. I liked the mystery of the story and the slow, tender way the author described the professor's relationship with his wife. The sadness and disorientation he felt after the death seemed very real.  The hidden despair shown in spurts by Lexy was frightening and sad.  The premise of the professor's trying to teach his dog to talk gave the book a special and interesting quirk.    An FYI: I would caution animal lovers that some parts of this book may not be to their liking because they do involve pain to dogs.	2005-02-05

A man and his wife, owners of Binewski's Carnival Fabulon, acquire many odd human freaks of nature, including their own children (both alive and dead) as part of their traveling show.  As odd as they are within the context of the story, the freaks tend to be the norm. \\"Normal\\" people flock to see the show and some even begin to amputate body parts in order to be more like Arty, the charismatic flipper-limbed star of the show. <br /> <br />Here is a most amazing book that will be either loved or hated by its readers.  The writing is wonderful.  The topic is difficult.  If the reader is not offended by the material and stops halfway through in disgust, the story itself turns out to be imaginative and thought-provoking.  It brings to mind concepts of what is \\"normal\\" versus freaky as well as makes us wonder why people often so blindly follow cults.	2005-02-03

As a service to the public, author Yehudah Berg presents a quick, easy-to-read outline of the basic tenets of kabbalah.   <br /> <br />I have two reactions to this book.  The first is that I appreciate being able to have a feeling for what the kabbalah is because I always thought it was something that was only appropriate for a rabbi or sage to study and not for the average man.  I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the basic tenets of the kabbalah mirror those thoughts I have developed about spirituality as opposed to religiosity during my life. <br /> <br />My second reaction was of disappointment.  Sadness that such a miraculous work is watered down to such a degree that it feels like \\"marketing' the kabbalah in the same way that any cult goes about selling its philopsophy.  Particularly objectionable to me is the book cover endorsment by Madonna.  In addition, I really dislike the blatant advertising of other books by the same publisher and the offers of a free consultation at the back of the book.  This makes the entire book seem more like a late-night TV ad than a book about a serious subject.	2004-11-25

In the author's desire to understand orchid growing, she visits nurseries of well-known orchid retailers and a prestigious orchid show. The Fakahatchee swamp becomes her focus as she joins LaRoche in pursuit of seeing a rare ghost orchid.    A history of orchids, the mysterious places they grow, and the people to whom they mean so much leave the reader with a deep appreciation of how plants can affect people.  It's a hobby; it's a career; it's an obsession.

A young boy, growing up in the Arab village of  Tira in Israel's Galilee region, describes life within his family and how it feels to be an Arab living in the overwhelmingly Jewish country of Israel. He gains entrance to a Jewish boarding school and finds it difficult to fit in. <br /> <br />I was afraid to begin this story because I didn't want to read a book filled with Arab hatred for Jews.  My hope in choosing this book was to get beyond the tragedy of the current political and socioeconomic situation in Israel and truly see an Arab as he lives in Israel. I was soon captured by this young boy's story.   It was so interesting and full of such vivid detail that I felt as if I were reading an autobiography rather than a novel, much in the same vein as I felt reading Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner.   <br /> <br />The story is sad because it reveals grimmer aspects of Arab-Jewish relations, but it also offers a glimmer of hope (much in the way that the Seeds of Peace did), that an important way to peace is through being open to learn about someone different.  The words of this novel are simple, but the emotions behind the narrative are far more complex.  In conveying those feelings to his readers, the author does a stunning job.  The plight and confusion of a man caught between two cultures is so clearly shown. <br /> <br />In a way, it is a depressing story.  Nonetheless, I appreciate the fact that the author has provided this insight into the Israeli-Arab culture for the wider world to share.  It shows just how difficult it is for an Arab to find a place as a valued member of the country in which the majority of the population is Jewish, and, once he finds a way to co-exist comfortably among Jews, how he finds that he has alienated himself from his own culture. <br />	2004-09-27

While visiting the cemetery in which they both had family graves, Maude and Lavinia become friend's with Simon, the gravedigger's son, a young man who is much more wordly than they.  Maude's mother, Kitty, is unhappy in her marriage and beseiged by her very demanding mother-in-law.  She seeks fulfillment in a second relationship and by becoming very active in the woman's suffrage movement.    This novel was much more than a story.  It clearly brought out a place and time with its setting in England in the early 20th century between the funerals of Queen Victoria and King Edward.  Each of its characters was well drawn--very distinctive in voice, complete with petty jealousies, quirks of personality, feelings of love and comradeship, and true to social class.  I especially liked Simon, the gravedigger's son, and always looked forward to the chapters in which his friends, Maude and Lavinia, visited the cemetery in which he worked.     One especially interesting aspect of this book was how much of the action took place around a cemetery.   Customs of death and mourning were explained, and the day-to-day action of working in a cemetery was revealed.  Another theme that was very educational was that of the women's suffrage movement.  Though I've always taken women's suffrage for granted, this novel helped me realize how hard it must have been for women at that time to bring about such a radical change to society.	2004-08-27

Ruth, a ghostwriter for women's self help books, lives with her boyfriend Art and his two daughters in San Francisco.  She becomes increasingly concerned about her mother's dementia.  Ruth finds it hard to tell what is real and not real in her mother's mind until she comes across a diary recording her mother's past.  Ruth discovers that her mother LuLing is from the town of Immortal Heart in China.  There her family was well known, not only for their ink business, but for her father's being a famous \\"Bonesetter\\" who treated his patients with \\"modern, try-anything, and traditional\\" medicine. Crucial to his practice of traditional medicine were dragon bones gathered by LuLing's family from the Monkey's Jaw, a secret place in a cave in the deepest ravines of a dry riverbed. LuLing's most beloved nursemaid, Precious Auntie,  taught her the secret of unearthing these dragon bones.<br />This beautiful story, like other Amy Tan novels, dwells on women's relationships.  As the novel opens, we explore Ruth's feelings of frutration as a daughter trying to deal with an independent, yet increasingly demented mother.  We also see her trying to be a mother to her boyfriend's two young daughters.  As we read the diary of LuLing, we see how hidden family secrets twist women's relationships into never-anticipated situations.<br />This work is so beautiful because it deals with real emotions, different for each individual, in two different cultures, settings, and times.  It helps the reader imagine what it would be like to be in any of those sitations by showing one family's experiences within that realm of existence.	2004-07-18

Eliezer was 15 years old when he, his sister and his parents were taken prisoner by the Nazis and deported from their home in Sighet, Transylvania, for the crime of being Jewish. Upon arrival to the concentration camp of Auschwitz, Eliezer and his father  were separated from Eliezer's mother and sister, never to see them again.  To survive the most inhumane conditions imaginable and to avoid immediate death, Eliezer and his father desperately tried to keep up their strength, thereby demonstrating to the Nazis their usefulness in their ability to work.  Each day brought new horrors, torture, starvation, exposure, exhaustion, and illness.  Constantly, death hovered over them and the other prisoners.  Their challenge: how to avoid the physical and emotional damage that hastened that almost certain death.<br />The author does a stunning job of presenting the difficult subject of the Holocaust.  He follows a father and son as they move from a religiously-observant life in Transylvania to the agonizingly slow and painful experience of  deportation and imprisonment in a series of concentration camps.  To make this story more acceptable, the author makes it neither long nor frightfully graphic.  It reads as a documentary presenting in clear detail the movements and emotions of one young man caught in an unreal world and how he suffers in his attempt to survive.  What causes the greatest sadness and horror to the reader is the slow realization of the degree to which man can inflict physical and emotional pain on another human being with little or no remorse. It is a difficult lesson but one which needs to be taught, understood, and remembered by all people.  Elie Wiesel begins this terrible education with Night.	2004-05-29

His greatest achievement had been writing an  internationally-known song, Rosas Puras, for his friend Rita Valladares, a beautiful and coquettish singer for whom he always had a secret love interest.  Being kind of timid in matters of love and very devoted to his devoutly Catholic mother,  Levis fills his life with music and parties, never giving voice to his love of Rita.  A rotund man with sexual desire but no woman of his own, Levis finds solace in brothels first in Cuba and later in France.<br />The author has a beautiful way of looking into one man's life. In telling Levis' sad story, Hijuelos creates a character so real, one does not know if this person really existed or not. Levis' frailties and thoughts are so equisitely presented, you almost wish you could jump into the book and have a part in this man's life.  Perhaps you could just talk to him and bring him the joy and fulfillment that he seems to be missing time after time.  His solace is music.  How comforting to know that a person who uses his talent to the best of his ability has the love of music to fall back on when other things in his life fail.  The background of the story, a lively Habana in the early part of the twentieth century, is one that I was not familiar with so enjoyed learning about a different feel of life in Cuba  from what  I know about life in that country now.	2004-05-22

His dad is dead, and the bank took over his family's farm. Dan, along with his \\"colored\\" colleague L.C., work for Dan's uncle Alvin by driving two old school buses that were converted into rolling snack stands. Marty, a friend of Dan's from the same town is stationed there as a guard for a camp of German POW's.<br />This is not an easy book to read. Besides having to keep the characters straight, it involves getting into the psyches of guys struggling with questions of racial inequality, considering the necessity or opposition to being in the armed service, and being so close to German prisoners of war. The story of these three young men comes alive with friendship as well as conflict as they struggle individually. Nothing comes easy for any of these three men.  Their story brings the reader with a heavy hand into the heart and mentality of a small Southern town in some very difficult times.	2004-03-29

Under Chairman Mao's rule in China, two young men from prominent families are sent to a tiny village for \\"re-education\\".  Much to their surprise, they find that a third young man, Four Eyes, in the same village has a hidden suitcase which they suspect contains books which, at that time,  were illegal to possess.  Both the narrator and his friend Luo become enamored with the friendly daughter of the tailor who regularly visits their village to engage in his trade.  <br />This debut novel tells of the relationship of two friends, how they react to a young woman attractive to both, how they deal with living in a small village meant for their re-education, and how books take on a special meaning in their lives. Books such as those that people in free countries take for granted can be like treasure for those deprived of them.  This novel tells what two young men do with such a precious treasure.	2004-03-21

A 16-year-old Chinese girl living in Manchuria plays the game of Go with a stranger. This stranger, disguised as a Chinese man, is a soldier in the Japanese army doing a bit of spying in the country he is occupying.  His duty is to sacrifice his life for his country of Japan.  The young girl is in love with Min, friend of Jing, both of whom are part of the Chinese Resistance to the Japanese invasion of China.<br />This is a novel with spare prose and a very engaging story.  It gives an account of the Japanese invasion of China from both country's perspectives in a very human way.  The short chapters alternate between the thoughts of a young girl and those of the Japanese stranger who meets her to play the game of Go.  Gentle writing moves the story through war-time China with a grace that at times belies the terror of that time.  Showing a human connection between two people who, in all rights, should be enemies, is what gives this story its soul. The violence of that time, even though described, never seems to gain the upper hand over the softness of the prose.	2004-03-16

Although attracted to him, she is never quite at ease with the situations his job demand of him.  Lily tells the story of her relationship with Ami while also revealing a bit about her present life in England through chapters which flip-flop through the time difference.  In addition, there are significant lessons in Hebrew words which add to the flavor of the book and provide insight into Israeli attitudes.   The author even adds one recipe to give the taste of the Mideast!<br />Due to the increasing complexity of political turmoil in Israel and a tendency to be more mainstream, modern Israeli novelists increasingly tend to omit political leanings in their writing.  No so Edeet Ravel.  She weaves it into the very heart of her story with great eloquence.  She expresses her views openly because one cannot live in Israel without revealing those feelings.  Beyond that, however, is a more heartbreaking story.  It's of how an Israeli woman feels in the company of a man who loves not only her but also his country and has an important duty to both.  The end of the story is one of the most powerful that I have read in a novel in a long time, and how the author creates this atmosphere is for the reader to discover.	2004-02-16

Enile Hazel and his wife Juliette finally reach retirement age and the two, who have been in love since their childhood, move to their perfect retirement home--out of the city and in a secluded spot.  That is, away from everyone except for a doctor and his wife who live in a nearby house.  The doctor pays the Hazels a visit one day but sits most unappreciatively in a living room chair only answering Mr.Hazel's questions with one-word answers. When this neighbor returns every day at precisely 4 p.m., things begins to get uncomfortable for everyone.<br />I love the way the author constructed this story.  It's short and to the point.  I can't tell whether or not the author is poking fun at any of the characters because they are all so pitiful.  The main character is a wimp who, at first, simply lets his neighbor call the shots. The neighbor is obnoxious and demanding.  The wife of the neighbor has to be absolutely  one of the most disgusting and repulsive characters I've ever encountered on the written page. The story itself is mesmerizing in a mysterious and creepy sort of way.  I like how the action turns inside out, how the characters sort of turn into each other.  I wonder what it all means. Perhaps it's a statement on man's need for solitude versus dependency.  Or maybe it's to say that we can never predict how we'll behave in a given situation and will try different behaviors until we find one that works.  Whatever meaning the author intends, this novel certainly is thought-provoking and well worth reading!	2004-02-13

Fifteen-year-old Christopher, a child with autism who lives with his father in Swindon, England, is horrified to discover that their neighbor's beloved pet dog Wellington has been killed by a garden fork.  Much to the dismay of his father, Christopher begins to investigate who was responsible for this animal's murder.  Despite his dad instructions to stop interefering in other people's business, Christopher does not stop persuing his goal.  In the course of trying to solve the murder without his father's knowledge, Christopher makes other startling discoveries about his family.<br />What is most amazing about this book is how Christopher's thoughts clearly express the turmoil that permeate the mind of an autistic individual.  Such a person understands the world differently from an average person, and the book does well at illustrating that difference.  By putting this young man's thought processes into words through a fascinating story, the author has the ability to influence his readers to become more compassionate to a person in the real world with such an aflliction. It's written so well that it almost seems to be a real story. Reminiscent of the way Jonathan Lethem treats Tourette's Syndrome in Motherless Brooklyn, Mark Haddon brings his readership closer to the true person inside an outer shell that can be misunderstood and frightening to others.	2004-02-09

Assaf, a 16-year-old living in Jerusalem, is sent to find the owner of a lost dog by following her at the end of a leash and to collect a fee for the dog's return.  He does not immediately find the owner, but he does find other people who recognize Dinka as the dog of Tamar.  One such person is the Greek nun Theodora who is happy to see Dinka but is more concerned about the disappearance of the dog's owner.<BR>  <BR>Grossman has created a story that involves the reader with a darker side of Jerusalem, but not the one that makes world news.    Dealing with the world of the city's disenfranchised streets kids, the book unfolds a tale of two young people each with a mission and how their paths cross.  The character's dialogues include much unspoken thought which provides a window into their uncertainties in dealing with others.  It also reflects how what is spoken is often not exactly what one feels. <br />The time construction of the novel was a bit unusual.  Each of the stories of the two main characters is a different length in time but converge in the end. The technique is done well and provides the reader with a chance to \\"put all the pieces  together\\" as the story develops.  <br />I especially like the dog who also is an important character.  In fact, she is the thread that brings most of the characters together.  And, like the dog, pulling Assaf along, this mini-mystery of a story has enough drive to pull its readers at a non-stop pace through to the end.	2004-02-07

Maybe it's the Baltimore nostalgia, or maybe it's the message that there's something awaiting everyone beyond what we see when we're young, but I really got into this story.  Bobby Shine and his male &quot;diner&quot; buddies bring back the ambivilance we felt between our friends the soldiers and our friends the hippies during the Vietnam War years. The novel awakens long lost memories of such things as coddies, peppermint sticks in lemons, the Flower Mart, Read's drug stores, dates at Mandel's, hanging out in a diner.   Having close buddies and a welcoming place such as the diner to discuss personal problems and accomplishments is basic to this story. Friendship reigns supreme.  Nothing quite matches the freedom and exhuberance of being young.  Even with its painful times.  This story captures it all.  Read it.	2004-01-28

Together with owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith, and jockey Red Pollard, Seabiscuit makes sports page history.  The story reveals it just as it happened.  We get to know the people and Seabiscuit first, and then we follow this horse's training and racing days. The story is written in such a way that the races seem like actual play-by-plays.  It's often hard not to jump up and yell \\"Go, Seabiscuit!\\" as the races are run on the pages of this book!

This tender but sad story touches on the loneliness of an elderly man, guilt over his family's past, his lost relationship with his son and former wife, and the expectations he puts on a friendship based on a relic from his past.  More than anything it expresses just how fleeting relationships are in this life and how important it is to have something onto which to hold in times of uncertainty.  <br />Told beautifully through Tristan's relationships with two young women (one a former student) in his present life and flashbacks to his life as a child in Nazi Europe (the Netherlands and Germany), this story is presented in such as way as to expose the vulnerability of one elderly man and leave the reader feeling just a bit sadder for having read this touching novel.	2003-12-17

Sylvia Nash chronicles the story of John Nash's descent from fame as a mathematician working in some of the most prestigious universities in the United States to the bizarre world of the schizophrenic and then back out into becoming a Nobel Prize in Economics recipient. With painstaking precision and tons of footnotes, she began with Nash's family history and proceeded through Nash's life up to the present, never thinking twice about presenting any fact which may be disagreeable to some readers in an effort to present Nash's life as clearly as possible.  Her work is not only a credit to non-fiction writing but is also one step in the right direction to help the public see mental illness as something other than an affliction to be shunned.  She shows that under the layers of a malfunctioning psyche, John Nash is a real human being.  Although the book contains many facts about mathematics that are beyond my understanding, presenting them lends credibility to the fact that John Nash has, not only a beautiful, but also a great mind.	2003-11-28

This is a small volume which gives Rabbi Kushner's interpretation of each line of the much-recited 23rd psalm.  One thing that may result from reading this book will be my directing more attention to the words of the psalm as I recite it in the future.  I liked reading Rabbi Kushner's ideas because they weren't presented as fact, but only as his opinion.  He did it in a way that caused me to think how I would interpret those very same lines.  An especially nice touch was that he used examples from many philosophies and theologies rather than just basing his opinions on Jewish thought.   This is a very nice book and one that lends itself to more than one reading by people of many religions.	2003-10-26

Amir, the son of a wealthy Pashtun businessman in Kabul, Afghanistan, spends the happiest days of his childhood in deep friendship with Hassan, the son of his father's servant who is a Hazara (an Afghan ethnic minority). Not all goes well with this friendship, however, and as the story progresses, the difficulties of maintaining that friendship have a lasting effect on both Amir's and Hassan's family.<br />There is something about this story that makes all the characters ring true...as if they are real characters who just stepped into this novel.  The story is quite captivating and, at times, gave me chills and brought me to tears.  I thought I could anticipate what would happen, but each time I was surprised.  What resulted was more like the experience of reading a real person's biography than of reading a novel.  In addition to the story of a unique friendship, the novel explores class differences, father-son relationships, Afghani culture, modern Afghani history, and introduces terms of the language spoken in Afghanistan).

The story explores the grueling physical and psychological realities of war experienced as a soldier the Israeli tank corps.  Haim relates his personal experience as he seeks to find an answer to what became of his yeshiva friend and study partner Dov who joined the tank corps at the same time that he did.  This is a gripping account of what it means to be a soldier and how just one individual tries to cope in the chaos of an unexpected war.

Edgar leaves his beautiful wife Katherine in London to make this trip to the primitive land of the Shan people.<br />What develops is a mystical story.  It is one that is steeped in history but has characters so real that it is, at times, hard to distinguish between fact and fiction.  That a magnificent piano should be in the heart of the Shan people is almost as incongruous as the presence of British soldiers in their land.  The pace of the story is very slow.  While that seems difficult to handle at first, one must realize that the distant land of Burma is a far different ambience from that of bustling city life in 19th century England.  This is a story most unlike any other I have read and is quite a remarkable tale woven from much research by debut novelist Daniel Mason.	2003-07-25

The story weaves back and forth between the past and present but in a unique way which draws each closer to the other.  Many points of view show how relationships can be strengthened or allowed to falter by how well each individual lets himself  become involved with one another.  Judaism seems to be treated in an irreverent manner and yet is given a subtle dignity.  A very few parts of the book had lines in which the action was not entirely clear.

This is a wonderful book of short stories which contradicts the sterotypical picture of Israelis so often portrayed in the nightly news. It shows (mostly from the female point of view) the nuances of many types of Israelis, from religious to secular, from Ashkenazi to Sephardic, from Arab to Jew. In particular, it brings out the human side of each of its characters and demonstrates that feelings change from time to time and situation to situation. These are beautiful studies of human interaction.<br />I have four favorite stories. In \\"A Room on the Roof\\", a woman's husband goes to Texas, and she decides to build a new room on the second story of her home while he's gone.  Her Jewish contractor leaves her alone with three Arab laborers during the construction process.  She is not sure to how to react to their presence near and in her home.  \\"The Road to Cedar City\\" tells of an Israeli couple (Hassida and Yehiel) and their son Yuval who are traveling in the United States when their rented car breaks down.  The wife is unhappy when she learns that she must share a ride in a minivan with another young Israeli couple and their baby who are from Jerusalem.  A talkative minivan driver further complicates matters by running his mouth during the entire trip. \\"Mother's Photo Album\\" is about a Dr. Joshua Hoshen who looks into his mother's medical record after she is hospitalized in a mental institution. He pieces together her life from what he reads in her record and uses a photograph to help resolve his anguish about what he discovers. A most notable story is \\"The Homesick Scientist\\" in which eldery Zerubavel wlcomes his nephew, a well-known Israeli scientist who lives in the United States, as he returns to visit Israel after 21 years. His nephew had frequently spent summers with Zerubavel after Zerubavel's own son Uri had been killed while on reserve duty.

His wife, Nadia,dies of cancer. Their only son Rico, leaves Dita, his girl-friend in Israel, to travel through the mountains of Tibet and finds himself sleeping with Maria, a Portuguese woman. Meanwhile, Dita, who has been cheated of her money and left with no place to live, convinces Albert to let her stay with him.<br />Here's a poignant story of one family, each member or aquaintance trying as hard as possible to establish control of his life.  That's not always as easy to achieve as it seems. The novel describes, in both in prose and poetry, how several people try to achieve that end.   The novel slips so easily from prose into poetry and vice versa, that even readers who are not particularly interested in poetry may not mind this writing technique. Although it's a melancholy story, it's also an intriguing look at how several people relate to one another and how their goals at some times in their lives tend to either attract or repel others close to them.  At one point, the author himself shows up as a character!  That is really an interesting occurence and a situation not oftened encountered in most novels.  <br />THE SAME SEA is not hard to read.  However, because of the style in which it is written, it would lend itself to being read more than once.  For sure, it deserves to be read at least a first time!	2002-05-06

On his way home from prison, he is followed by a man whom he can't seem to shake.  When this man, who refers to himself as \\"Wednesday\\", begins to appears uncannily at all places that Shadow travels, Shadow's interest in him him becomes more acute to the point that he finally agrees to take a job with him. Shadow is not entirely certain of what his job entails, though.<br />This story walks a delicate line between reality and fantasy, incorporating characters who may, at first glance, seem normal but are not.  In addition, there are many dreams that Shadow experiences that also make it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction in his life.  Shadow, however, is a likeable fellow and one with whom the reader sympathizes and wishes well.  It is for this reason that this novel succeeds so well.  For every difficulty that Shadow faces, the reader is left hoping he'll make it through his bizarre experiences unharmed.	2002-05-06

The friendship of Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, and British Archibald Jones is hilarious. Their cultures and behavior are so different, yet their good fellowship endures. Samad, through an arranged marriage, weds Alsana, also a Bengali Muslim. Archie marries a very young black Jamaican woman, Clara, after his first marriage ends. Their roles as parents become quite trying, however, when another British couple, Joyce and Marcus Chalfen, involve themselves with the Samad's twin boys (Millat and Magid) and Archie's daughter (Irie). Suddenly the younger generation breaks loose from the teachings of their parents and the novel just takes off!<br />Teenage rebelliousness and culture clash highlight this novel. The story deals expertly with parent-child relationships, religion, race, culture, friendship, marital relationships, and ethics. Everything is done with compassion and very sharp humor. This is a surprisingly mature and insightful book for a young first-time author. A remarkably inventive plot and great writing make this a must read.	2002-03-18

Written in second person and narrated by those whose lives intersect with that of Dr. Bruno Sachs, this novel is a portrait of a French country physician's daily life and his practice of medicine. The story is told by patients, friends, relatives, a girl-friend and the doctor's own writing. Most of the book is sparkling dialogue. Dr. Sachs is portrayed ascaring, dedicated, practical, supportive, and determined.<br />Very creative in the way it's told, the story brings out the main character vividly through the eyes of others. It's not often that a novel can so accurately portray the human side of a medical practitioner. Might it have something to do with the fact that the author, a medical doctor himself, wants to let the world know what a doctor feels and how he reacts to patients on a day to day basis as well as show what patients really feel about their physician? If so, he thoroughly succeeds, as his delightful story conveys all that and more.	2002-02-16

This cookie book provides a great way for even the mediocre baker to get outstanding results and impress friends. It has beautiful, large, detailed photos which show how the results are supposed to look. Clear, precise instructions assist the baker along the way. Hints are included which help ensure even greater baking success. (I like the idea of lining pans with foil.

Fortunately, I have enough receptive snackers in my family to make this an eventual possibility!<br />I'd suggest that even if you don't want to get this book for yourself, present it as a surprise to someone who likes to bake.

In a novel that's fresh, crisp, and entertaining, Kenaz brings his readers into a rather dark mosaic of contemporary Israeli life.  Describing a number of residents in a Tel Aviv apartment complex, the author delves deeply into the psyches of such <BR>diverse individuals as an invalid who has been left in the care of an immigrant maid and is unable to clearly verbalize his thoughts, a couple distressed at discovering that their soldier son is being sought for going AWOL from the army, and a \\"kept woman\\" who debates the pros and cons of staying in her secret love relationship.  There are five separate stories which,<BR>although each can stand on its own strength, are interwoven to produce a \\"neighborhood\\" of connected stories.  It's like nosing into neighbors' lives and suddenly finding out too much.  Often people are much more complex than they seem and their relationships to other people are not apparent in their their outward actions.  These are stories that work well together and provide an entertaining and absorbing read through to the very last page.	2001-10-01

Globerman, the cattle dealer and the second of the three fathers , falls in love with Judith when he comes to do business with Moshe. Sheinfeld, a canary breeder and the third father, believes he has a relationship with Judith when, in fact, he doesn't. Who the fathers are and the extent of their relationships to Judith and Zayde are revealed as the story is told.<br />Shalev is most magnificent when he describes the pioneers of Israel as individual characters. They are colorful, quirky, and strong. Again in this book, the author uses the splendor of animals and nature to create a rich, complex story. It may seem confusing at the onset, but all pieces fall into place in the end and the vivid imagery lingers long after the book is closed.	2001-09-09

After living in the city their whole lives, they take their three pets--her dying cat named Bob, her dog named Betty and his \\"standard\\" poodle Marley--and begin country life on their newly acquired property.<br />Here's a story that's easy to read yet captivating because of its delicious deadpan humor, appreciation of country folk's cameraderie, and deep unabashed love of animals.  The reader is drawn so strongly into the narrative that the characters become real people. How wonderful to look at the way in which one person's dream becomes reality even though this particular situation may well be out of the fiscal reach of the average single woman. The strength of the story lies in the fact that it deals with problems common to everyone---the impending death of a beloved pet, the fear of a cancer diagnosis, the whirlwind journey of wedding preparations.  Its conversational tone is almost like that of a telephone chat between women friends, ultimately bringing bouts of laughter, tears of sadness, and whoops of joy.  This kind of story should never end and definitely merits another book to find out what happens next.	2001-07-10

He begins and ends his travels in his former home state of Iowa which he finds delightful.  Covering thousands of miles throughout the United States traveling alone by car, he visits numerous cities, small towns and occasional tourist traps. <br />Bryson's stories are hilarious but often have a biting edge to them.  He finds a few places which gratify him, but mostly he finds disappointment.  Too many times he seems to be in places or situations that he does not like.  He often is critical, even nasty, in the descriptions of people he meets along the way.

Henry Park, the son of a Korean grocer who lives in New York, is deserted suddenly by his Caucasian American wife.   Reflecting back on his life and and the events that lead him to this situation, he considers the way deceipt over his vocation has clouded his marriage.  He reviews how his life had been when his dad was alive, when his son was alive, and the lack of understanding by his wife of his Korean culture.  <br />A pervading sense of something having gone wrong opens this book.  The search for its cause and more details is the powerful driving force behind this intriguing first novel.  Its finest characteristic, however,  is the way in which the author expresses what it feels like to be an ethnic Korean growing up in America---the alienation, the anguish, the longing to be a necessary part of the wider culture.  It addresses the dichotomy of two divergent cultures that must be embraced by the child of an American immigrant who strives to improve his station in life, the tension that exists between Asians and non-Asians who find themselves living and working side by side, and the intergenerational clash that often occurs between the immigrant generation and its children.  NATIVE SPEAKER is an absorbing story and a welcome addition to any growing collection of Asian-American literature.	2001-04-03

At first they are accompanied by another couple, but, a bit later, father and son are left to continue their journey alone.  Throughout the trip, the author is deep in thought which is reflected in the paucity of communication with his son and more communication with himself alone.<br />A reader involved with this book must either have great fortitude or a fervent interest in philosophy to make it to the end of the story.  Despite its haunting quality, its philosophic meanderings are often overwhelming for the casual reader.  Best reserved for a reader who likes to \\"work\\" at reading, ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE, is a sad but profound story of philosophic theory, mental illness, and a father-son relationship which will leave a deep impression on those willing it struggle through it.	2001-01-30

Chiyo is hopeful that she and her sister will be adopted by the wealthy Mr. Tanaka, owner of the Japan Coastal Seafood Company.   They are surprised when he does not adopt them but rather takes them by train to Kyoto and later horrified when they are cruelly separated from one another.  Chiyo finds herself thrust into the position of a maid in an okiya (house of geisha), but she does not know where her sister was taken.<br />Memoirs of a Geisha opens a rich new world of traditional Japanese customs to the Western reader.  Although the author is an American man, he transcends the barriers of gender and culture in telling this story.  He narrates his story in the first person of the geisha Sayuri while also fully developing the relationships between other predominantly female characters.  His tale is so convincing that, at times, it's hard to think of this memoir as a work of fiction.  The Japanese theme of geisha is treated by the author with utmost respect and understanding.  It's a beautiful story which leaves an indelible mark on the heartstrings of its readers.	2001-01-16

Popular author of legal thrillers Penn Cage returns with his four-year-old daughter to his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi, following the death of his wife from cancer.  Shortly after his return, he becomes intrigued with the 1968 Natchez murder case of Del Payton, not only because it involves a black man aspiring to obtain an employment position formerly given only to whites, but also because it is somehow tied to Leo Marston, a powerful former district attorney who once tried to destroy the medical career of Penn Cage's father through a malpractice law suit.    <br />Iles does it again! In THE QUIET GAME, the author has created a truly suspenseful story with fully fleshed-out characters that have thoughts and feelings beyond the plot of the story.  Using a setting of Natchez, Mississippi, his own hometown, he gives readers a view of this Southern city complete with its picturesque beauty, its strengths, and its faults. The novel comes complete with two beautiful women, an adorable little girl, a loving family, racial tension, and devious villains.  For the size of the novel, it succeeds very well in maintaining the momentum of its story.  When, at first, the information Cage seeks to solve the murder case comes a bit easily, the reader is fooled into thinking the mystery will be readily solved.  Then bullets start flying, a house burns down, and still the mystery remains.  Tension continues to build, making for an absorbing, provocative read.	2000-12-16

At 84 years of age,  Herman Wouk, one of the giants of contemporary American Jewish literature, presents his view of the survival of the Jewish people.  His narrative moves back and forth between a thumbnail sketch of Jewish history and a colorful personal history .  He indicates that the two motivating forces that have kept  Judaism cohesive and growing during the twentieth century--the Holocaust and the birth of the state of Israel--are no longer of recent enough memory in the younger generation to ensure Jewish survival.  Are there other factors, as the twenty-first century begins, that can influence young Jews to preserve their ancient heritage?  This is the tough question the author attempts to address.<br />Wouk's whirlwind tour of Jewish history is unsatisfactory because it flies through time and presumes an in-depth knowledge by the reader.   Far more satisying are the author's personal reflections as to how his life experiences and knowledge of the past allow him to appreciate his Jewish heritage.  What seem to be lacking at the beginning of the book book are fill-in-the-blank kind of things.  It is almost as if the author's intention is to get his readers to find the missing information by going to Judaic sources and reading what they need to know to preserve the Jewish faith. Nice ploy!  <br />THE WILL TO LIVE ON concludes with Wouk's thoughts about the survival of the Jewish people into the distant future.  His impressions differ regarding the Jews of Israel and those of the diaspora.  He has one especially important thought to share about how diaspora Jewry can ensure their survival.  It's not worth peeking at the last few pages of the book ahead of time, however, because the strength of Wouk's case slowly builds throughout the narrative.  The reader can then sit back and truly savor the elderly author's insightful conclusion.	2000-12-02

Should Henry confront her or must he suffer silently?  His new knowledge of his mother's behavior is a burden for Henry.  While he agonizes over this, his parents seem to be quietly waging their own war over Elvira, Henry's younger sister, who is slowly become a living re-enactment of a Civil War soldier.<br />DISOBEDIENCE is a novel of modern times and yet of an old problem.  It focuses on a high-tech way of not only conducting, but also monitoring, a less than desirable relationship.  The characters are so authentic that at least one of them is sure be reminiscent of a real life person!  Hamilton does the voice of Henry so well that  it's hard to realize that he is a fictional character and not a real young man struggling with a terrible family problem.  All of the characters are graced with passion and humor which shine through the pages.   <br />Hamilton highlights the way in which one particular family scapeges a particularly vulnerable family member.  Often this happens in real life--the act of scapegoating--even though family problems are often system problems, those having to do with relationships between family members.   Although some readers may view Elvira's antics as humorous, they are quite the opposite.  In this story, Elvira suffers a great deal of torment from her mother and brother for an interest in which she has a great passion. Hamilton brings great insight into family relationships and into a teenager's way of thinking.  Teens often think have things figured out, but they don't have enough life experience to truly understand complex situations.  Some readers may be put off by theslow-moving the plot, but the pyschological action never lets up until the the last page is read.	2000-11-20

On one of their jobs, Esrog and a partner suddenly realize realize that their boss has been taken captive and is being sped away by car through the streets of New York city.  They must rush after him and not allow him to be lost from view.  The race is on!<br />Lethem gives his readers a wonderfully creative and somewhat unusual novel. Throughout the story, Lionel displays the aberrant behavior of a person afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome.  Since Lionel is the protagonist, the reader not only experiences Lionel's verbal outbursts and physical tics, but is also given some insight into their manifestation .  The story is a  mystery, and at times almost becomes a satire of life in New York city.  It is fast-paced and funny, with creative word-play, occasional amusing situation descriptions, and even a few (good) jokes. The writing is done so well that, once this story has begun, the book is often hard to put down. As the novel draws to a close, the plot tends to become a bit more complicated and confusing. Nevertheless, it's an exciting, entertaining story and one that should not be missed.	2000-11-14

There's a much more powerful story underneath the author's amusing anecdotes of his life during World War II. I'd love to hear the more serious side of his story.

This endearing memoir of a NASA engineer recalls life in Coalwood, a small West Virginia coal mining town, during the author's high school years of the late 1950's.  It captures the essence of youth complete with sibling rivalry, mischief, and the quest for knowledge of how things work--the hallmark of young boys.  In addition, the description of Coalwood brings to life the meaning of growing up in a small mining town--its sights, smells, and sounds. It teaches adults a great lesson--that of guiding youth to follow their passions and of  encouraging them along the way.  Its message is for the average guy--not the most popular or wealthy one--suggesting that ideas can be the key to the path of success in life.

This story is a painstakingly-researched chronicle of the hurricane which devastated the up-and-coming glorious city Galveston, Texas, in 1900.  It is presented as the story of Isaac Cline, a meterologist who underestimates the power of one particular storm with tragic results.  Beginning somewhat drily with the history of meteorology in the United States, the narrative proceeds to tell the stories of individual families and how they are affected as the storm unexpectedly arrives at their beach and ocean waters begin to swallow their beloved city. The pace of the account then picks up momentum and it's a race to see who will survive the momentous onslought of wind, rain, and sea water. <br />Although the story of Isaac Cline evokes sympathy, as an individual he does not come across as a particularly appealing person.  He works more or less as an adversary to his brother Joseph, also a meteorologist, both vying for top positions.  The Weather Bureau of that time also seems less then helpful.  Those in charge try to outmaneuver fellow meterologists in order for each man to claim his own fame.  <br />As the author indicates from his story, many forces were at work preventing the population of Galveston from knowing the true extent of the danger that was soon to engulf them.  It reminds us that, in our own time, we are fortunate to be able to understand more about the forces of weather and sometimes have a better chance to avoid a tragic outcome of a huricane.	2000-10-28

His mother, too busy having other children, becomes heavily dependent on alcohol.  His one-legged father is much too involved with his job as an occasional hit man and bouncer for a fancy brothel. As a very young child, Henry takes to living on the streets with his even younger brother Victor.<br />The beginning of A STAR CALLED HENRY is reminiscent of how Frank McCourt describes childhood poverty in Ireland.  The difference is that Henry Smart becomes infuriated by it.  From the anger with which Henry is born, to his developing philosophy of terrorism, through his cold-blooded and feelingless executions, the story leaves the reader shuddering. At times it becomes  hard to read because it presents the idea of a terrorist and murderer as protagonist. Doyles uses short clipped sentences and phrases to keep the action hopping.   Because the reader becomes so involved with Henry, it's difficult to know whether to root for him or against him.  As in other Doyle novels, the author does a terrific job of capturing the flavor of Ireland as well as pentrating deep within an individual's psyche. Even if the reader lacks specific knowledge about the Irish Rebellion, the turmoil of warring factions (and even factions within factions) is captured so well.  Here is an engaging read not to be missed for any Doyle fan.	2000-10-17

In a well organized and presented book, de Gavin discusses the fact that an individual often experiences the intuition of something wrong before the onslaught of a violent act. He then goes on to say that, rather than surpressing our instinctive awareness of danger, we should heed its call, and do what we can to avoid risk to ourselves.

Toru Okada has been married for 6 years when his wife Yokimura asks him to find her lost cat.  Soon after he begins to look for the cat, his wife also mysteriously disappears.  In looking for both, he encounters such strange characters as Malta Kano, a lady in a red vinyl hat, Creta Kano, her prostitute daughter, May Kasahara, the girl in the alley, and Lietuenant Mamiya, the former Japanese soldier who delivers a box and remains to tell a gruesome war story.  Mr. Okada decides to ponder his state of affairs deep within a well on the abandoned property near his house and the story proceeds from there.<br />As in other Japanese fiction, THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE is a novel of complex ideas told in simple sentences.  This story of epic proportion has multiple elements that make reading a pleasure...including mystery, puzzling characters, friendship, history, symbolism, brutality, revenge, spirituality, and a sense of justice.  It can be read at many levels, interpreted many ways, or enjoyed for being simply a story of two different world which intersect at different points in time.  The driving force behind the novel is the search for how seemingly unrelated occurences will later converge.  Compelling the reader to move forward at an ever increasing rate of speed, the plot will not release its grip until the very last sentence.  Then it only does so with a warm feeling of friendship and a hope that good will always prevail over evil.	2000-10-01

In this thrilling book, the evolution of American submarine espionage is  explored, starting with the diesel submarines of the post World War II era  through the present use of nuclear-powered submarines.  Presented in a way  to evoke suspense, the book contains enough excitement to rank with the  best of spy fiction. The authors present true stories collected through  pesonal interviews with naval personnel who actually served aboard various  espionage submarines as well as from sifting through documents of  previously classified information.   Not everyone who was approached for an  interview was willing to share information, though some naval personnel  were glad to finally be able to talk about the stressful situations they  encountered in their tense and secret missions.  What is revealed about  submarine espionage teaches a citizen to be skeptical when learning about  it. It seems that the truth is not always what the government or press  reveal!<br />A reader need not have any previous knowledge of submarines to  enjoy this book.  Although there is humor in some of the stories, none of  them lose sight of the potential and actual occurences of death by fire,  explosion or drowning.  Many of the stories are truly astounding, such as  the one about an American submarine tapping a communications cable in  Soviet waters so close to shore that beachgoers' faces could be clearly  seen through a periscope!  Reading such stories elicits compassion for the  brave naval personnel who spend months submerged deep in salty waters,  often in perilous situations, to serve their country.  The book shares the  feeling that American submarine personnel developed great compassion for  their \\"enemy\\" because they, too, were fellow submariners.	2000-09-18

Proffy is a 12-year-old Jewish child in British-occupied Palestine before  the establishment of the state of Israel.  When his two friends, Ben Hur  and Chita, find out that he's been keeping company with Stephen Dunlop, a  British solder, they bring Proffy  to trial and accuse him of being a  \\"low-down traitor\\" and not at all the underground resistance fighter he  professes to be.<br />PANTHER IN THE BASEMENT  presents a child's view of the  political situation in 1947 Palestine.  It questions who the enemy truly is  and whether one's enemy can be a friend at the same time or possibly later.   Oz does a great job of bringing politics down to it's simplest form as he  examines how three children view the enemy differently.  There is an  element of danger introduced through Proffy's parents who are, in fact,  involved with the resistance movement against the British, although they  try to keep their son feeling safe and secure.  Here's an interesting  story, brimming with nostalgia, sometimes purposely going off on tangents,   but eventually coming to a warm, moving conclusion.	2000-09-04

Ximena is the young daughter of a wealthy couple living on an hacienda in the highlands of the Andean mountains of Peru.  Her parents shelter her and  pamper her, providing her with education, a safe home, and loving care.   She seeks knowledge of  anything outside the realm of what her parents  allow, often resorting to pictures, conversations, observations, and  stepping outside of the physical boundaries imposed upon her by her  parents.<br />XIMENA AT THE CROSSROADS succeeds at so many levels.  The  chapters work as a developing novel or simply as short stories.  Each is  beautiful in its own right.  There is variation in tense and person as the  novel progesses.  At one point, with the use of second person, the reader  is taken into the novel itself and becomes Ximena! The story reveals how  differences among people affect one child.  There is a sense of the uneven  way in which a child learns about the world through observation, pictures,  stories, and conversations--often fusing fact with fantasy--and how  fragmented the input is, always colored or filtered by what adults keep  secret from a child. The message of social injustice becomes clearer   toward the end of the novel as Ximena becomes directly involved in a  dangerous situation. For a colorful and lush novel about a child's learning  about her world, this is a novel not to be missed.	2000-08-24

It's not until Helen Fremont is an adult that she discovers that her Polish parents, whom she always believed were Catholic, were in fact both  Jewish by birth.  Because surviving World War II had been so difficult for  them, neither wanted to share details of their past with Helen or her  sister Lara until the daughters started researching family history for  themselves.<br />AFTER LONG SILENCE is a fascinating story of survival against  great odds, yet the focus of the story keeps coming back to the author and  her sister.  Throughout the heartbreaking story of Helen's family, it  somehow seems as if it's told through the eyes of the author instead the  mother.  Much of the historical context is missing, such as a thorough  description of the town in which her parents lived, a closer look at  extended family and friends, and a clearer picture of wartime atrocities.  It's agonizing to realize the extent to which Helen's parents, at first  very unwillingly, had to open up to share their<br />painful past with her.  It's also disturbing for the reader to learn that the book is about family  secrets rather than a clear picture of one family's history. Nevertheless,  as a gripping saga of survival in World War II Poland, this book should be  read to learn of yet another way one particular family was able to get  through a most gruesome time in recent history.	2000-08-22

In AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, Richard Brautigan, icon of the 60's, bids farewell to the world.  Within two years of this book being written, the  author is dead of an apparent suicide.  Now years later, the book has  published by his daughter Ianthe.  For those who have enjoyed Brautigan's  writing in the past, here is a gem to be relished.  For those unfamiliar  with his writing, it might be best avoided.<br />The story, a travelogue of a  47-year-old writer, revolves around the deaths of two women<br />friends, one  by suicide and the other by cancer, of which the details of neither are  revealed.   Throughout the disjointed ramblings of the writer, run veins of  wry humor, snippets of nature, travel, melancholy, regret, alcoholic  stupor, lonliness, and the shadow of death.  The dated journal is a running  commentary on everything from the minutiae of day-to-day living to the  meaning of life--all told in only the sardonic way that Richard Brautigan  can tell it--with gems to be savored hidden within.	2000-08-05

In April, 1992, 24-year-old Chris McCandless, a honors graduate of Emory  University and former resident of Annadale, Virginia, decides to take off  on his own into the wilds of Alaska after living the life of a vagabond  throughout the United States for almost 2 years. Unfortunately his lone  adventure proves fatal and his decomposed body and belongings are found in  an old schoolbus far from a location in which someone might have learned of  his travails.<br />INTO THE WILD recreates the story of Chris McCandless.  It  begins from the discovery of his body and works backward, as the author  decribes not only Chris's background and family, but also his pyche.  Not  unlike other dreamers, such as Tolstoy, Thoreau, and even the book's author  Jon Krakauer, Chris (who changes his name to Alex) follows his dream.   Being completely alone with the harsh realities of nature is often looking  death in the face.  Krakauer compares Chris to other men in the past who  have also met their demise alone in the wild.  Krakauer also takes the  opportunity, since this is his book, to tell of his own adventure alone in  the wild.  Whether the reader admires Chris for his idealism or berates him  for his craziness, Krakauer's book makes for fascinating reading.	2000-08-05

In highly readable book which is not meant to malign an entire people or culture, but rather to record a little-known history, Iris Chang presents an account of the events that occurred in the city of Nanking, China,  during World War II.  Beginning with a brief history of Sino-Japanese  relations and some  insights into the Japanese culture, Chang proceeds to  tell about the Japanese invasion of China and atrocities perpetrated both  on Chinese soldiers and civilians by the Japanese forces occupying Nanking.   In conclusion, she relates how Japan to this day has not taken  responsibility for those atrocities nor has atoned for them.<br />THE RAPE OF  NANKING is a detailed and well researched chronicle of a situation of man's  inhumanity to man and  an important lesson in history.  It must made more  public despite Japan's attempt to cover up the facts of what truly  occurred. Some of the barbaric torture that the Chinese victims were forced  to endure at the hands of the Japanese and the speed at which it occurred  make the systematic murders of  Nazi Germany seem tame by comparison.   Chang tries to understand how any individual or group of people can become  so completely insensitive to life as to perform unthinkably barbarian  attacks and murders and then go on to live an otherwise normal life and  never be held accountable for past animal-like brutality.  She paints a  clear picture of what happened to the Chinese population of Nanking at that  point in history in an attempt to prevent such tragedies and waste of human  life from ever happening again.	2000-07-30
US	52747250	R20VV94V6YRBY8	0151002703	518332576	On Parole	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A beautifully flowing story!	Shiro Kukatani, a high school English teacher, has been released on parole after 15 years in prison.  He slowly reacquaints himself with the society he knew prior to his imprisonment.  Feeling guilty that, despite his long  years of confinement, he feels no remorse for his crime, Kukatani must  adapt to living independently again albeit under the supervision of his  probation officers.<br />ON PAROLE  is a story unadorned with fluff, moving  slowly and simply with words that evoke deep thought and emotions.   It  examines Kukatani's feelings of tentativeness as he emerges from prison.  Speaking of his attempts to reenter a world beyond prison bars, the reader  can feel Kakatani's yearning to reach back into his former life, the  fascination and repulsion of discovering an environment that continued to  change despite his stagnant years of imprisonment, and his longing to  connect to other people while overpowered by his fear to do so.  In  essence, the story describes how a parolee's life can never return to that  of the past.  The deed that sent Kukatani to prison is not the story, but  rather it's the psychological adaptation of a parolee to what lies beyond  the prison's gate and the question as to whether there is such a thing as  true rehabilitation of a criminal.	2000-07-29

Sybil Danforth is a midwife who attends home births.  She is involved in a case in which Charlotte Bedford, one of her birthing mothers, dies in  childbirth while Charlotte's newborn infant son survives.  Due to the  unusual circumstances surrounding this birth, a lawsuit against Sybil  arises.  Sybil's husband hires Steven Hastings,  a costly lawyer, and all  parties tensely await the trial and its final outcome.<br />MIDWIVES is a book  which presents a critical look at a controversial profession.  Although  home birth is a more natural way of bringing a child into the world than  hospitalization, it is not without its risks.  In a rather slow-moving  account of the Danforth family, the author describes how one home birth  goes wrong and the suffering of all parties involved in this misfortune.   Told from the point of view of Connie, Sybil's teenage daughter, the story  lacks the suspense that normally pulls a reader to a book's finish.   Rather,  like Connie's family, the reader experiences the long, tedious  wait for the final outcome.	2000-07-18

Barnaby Gaitlin works for Rent-A-Back, a private company supplying labor  to perform chores for the elderly and infirm people of Baltimore. Barnaby  has no interest in his parents' wealth, but he does have an interest in one  family tradition--that of finding a personal angel.  While enroute to  Philadelphia to visit his daughter Opal, he encounters a suspicious  situation involving a woman named Sophie and thinks that she just might be  his personal angel.<br />A Patchwork Planet is a story of Baltimore and some  of its inhabitants.  Frequently mentioning streets and places in and around  the city, the author delves into the life of one of its young men.  This is  a rather mundane fellow whose life is not all that interesting.  Yet the  author is able to capture the flavors of Barnaby as a person and those  people who are part of his life. What's missing from the author's story is  the \\"bite\\" of an exciting plot.  Despite that drawback, she captures the  nuances of everyday life--those small tensions that bubble beneath the  surface of family relationships and friendships. A story of conversations,  modest expectations, and family irritations, the author delivers a low key,  down-home sort of tale.	2000-07-09

Her mother, the beautiful poetess Ingrid, is obsessed with reclaiming the adoration of a short-term lover, Barry Kolker, and has no time for her  daughter.  Astrid is told she has no father.  When a desperate act takes  Astrid's mother from her, she is placed in a series of foster homes, each  one in turn creating more loneliness and uncertainty.<br />WHITE OLEANDER is a  profoundly sad story of a young teenager experiencing the pain and  vulnerability of an ambivalent mother-child relationship and the lack of a  nurturing home environment.  It brings alive the many cruelties people  impart on others, sometimes unknowingly.  Astrid's thoughts are expressed  so clearly and mirror the needs of any young girl.  Beautiful imagery using  flowers and fragrances abound.  The people in this story are not only  varied but so fully alive that it's hard to leave one behind and move on to  the next.  The most haunting part of the story, though, is the character of  Ingrid whose esoteric view of life is strikingly similar to white oleander,  so very beautiful yet poisonous.	2000-06-25

Dr. Breggin presents a discussion of how American society does a disservice to our troubled school children by labelling them with psychiatric diagnoses and medicating them rather than critically examining  the alienation and abandonment caused by family, schools, and communities.   For parents, counselors, and educators, a most important chapter is one  which offers suggestions for improving our schools.  The book stresses that  the most important factor in assisting the positive growth of our children  is an individual child's relationship with a loving, mature adult.  Even in  impoverished communities, children can succeeed if a nuturing adult is  there to counter negative effects of such adverse events as drugs,  violence, and racism.  The book is an alert for parents, counselors, and  educators.  If this information is acted upon by increasing numbers of  caring adults, the quality of the lives of our precious youth should  significantly improve.

This powerful story deals with the injustices and sufferering endured by twin brothers  whose lives are inextricably bound to each other.  The narrative reads as if the main character is talking, just pouring out his  anguish, in hopes that, if someone would listen, all would be better.   Domenick's fear and cynicism emanate from the book's pages.  As  the pace  of the narrative quickens, the fear and helplessness experienced by  Domenick and Thomas  seem to grow.  There is also the sense of Domenick's  rage as his mother lays dying, his twin brother continues to be his  lifetime reponsibility and source of embarassment, and two important women  in his life leave his expectation of a perfect married life unfulfilled.  <br />Lamb's writing is terrific.  The character of Thomas' psychiatrist Dr.  Patel, who very professionally and warmly interviews Domenick, is  especially well drawn.  She so touchingly reaches into the soul of Domenick  way past his macho bravado to unlock a very tender part of the male psyche.   The lesson the book teaches is that people aren't perfect, but that with  understanding comes forgiveness and personal growth.	2000-06-03

In Kerala, India, the twins' mother Ammu is raising  them with the help of  the twins' grandmother Mammachi, their great-aunt Baby Kammachi, and their  uncle Chako.  At the beginning of the story, Chako's young daughter Sophie  Mol was found dead.  From her funeral, the story moves back and forth in  time to reveal the circumstances of  her death and how someone that the  twins loved by day and Ammu loved by night tore the family apart.<br />At  first, this book is impossible to absorb.  Don't despair.  Persist!  Push  forward until the story grabs you!   The author's writing might seem  fragmented and annoying at first.  Later, when you figure out the action,  the writing becomes lyrical.   It has a beautiful rhythm and sound to it.     This book might not be for everyone, though.  My husband never made it  past the first page!   He kept repeating &quot;It was just the language.  I  couldn't get through it.

Then suddenly, while speeding through a California road late one  rainy night, he struck and killed a teenage boy.  He was aware of his need  to report his accident to authorities. However, circumstances kept  occurring which allowed him to make excuses to delay his confession.   <br />How Jason lived with this dark secret made for interesting reading, but  the story took some unbelievable twists. The characters never seemed real  to me.  I was actually more interested in the story of Jason's vineyard  than the story of his moral dilemma.  I found  the fact that a professional  lawyer would be sharing his life story (albeit edited) with his  incarcerated client both unethical and unlikely.  As for the novel's end,  it was preposterous!	2000-05-06

Beginning with the orphan Mazal, four generations of women in Jerusalem were beset by a curse of failed marriages and absent fathers.  Continuing Mazal's curse were her golden-haired daughter Sarah, her cat-loving  grand-daughter Pnina-Mazal, and her rebellious spikey red-headed   great-granddaughter Geula.   The curse was set to end with the birth of  a  healthy baby boy to Mazal's great-great grandaughter Amal.  An especially  interesting character was Sarah's son Yitzchak, who although retarded and  mute (except for the word &quot;food&quot;)  had a continuing role  throughout the book.<br />Rich in detail and with a perfect use of magical  realism, I found this story and the writing delightful.  Some parts were  funny in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.  It was like reading a cross  between Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Amoz Oz.  There is so much in this story  that by the time I reached the end, I almost forgot what happened in the  beginning.  No problem.  That was just an invitation to reread this book!   You'll savor every sentence for the feeling and humor with which Amal's  story is told.	2000-05-05

In this earthy novel of Ned Rose and his sister Daze, the reader learns what it's like to grow up as a poor white in a state which is both class and color conscious.   Ned works as an oxygen man who checks the oxygen level in the catfish  ponds of Mack Bell, while his sister is employed as a bartender at the Beer  Smith Lounge. There are glimpses of the sibling's often-absent,  beer-in-hand parents, Ned's macho high school football buddies, and the  gritty, more well-to-do employers of the common black and white  folks.<br />This is an unsettling story which gets down and dirty right from  the start.  It's not a pleasant book nor one for the lighthearted.  There's  a strange uneasiness about it.  You'll hope for the best as you read, all   the while expecting the worst.  The very real characters are not people  you'd like to know.  But the author, in a surprisingly good first novel,  gets you deeply involved in their feelings of scorn.  If you like the  creepy characters in Pete Dexter's The Paper Boy, Ruth Hamilton's The Book  of Ruth, or James Dickey's Deliverance, you'll like this book.  The  chapters are short and interesting.  It's a book that's easy to read in  short spurts, pick up and put down at any time, and the appeal is always  there.	2000-05-04

The writing evoked both fear and seasicksickness as the seas became rougher!  It spoke deeply of the quiet hurt of fishermen's wives, the devotion fisherman have  to each other, their boats and the ocean, and the ever-present dangers of  the sea-faring life.  The author used an interesting technique whereby he  had two stories going at once--the present going backward and the past  going forward.  It worked and neither narrative detracted from the other.   There were some places in the narrative which needed to be reread in order  to be more clearly understood.  In addition, there were a few technical  words relating to fishing and boating which might have interfered with the  reading pleasure of someone not as knowledgeable about maritime life.   Nevertheless, this was a story well told and worth reading.	2000-05-03

The author provides a thought-provoking examination of how one Oriental man conducts his life  in order to be accepted and deemed \\"proper\\" by others of his community.  Parts of the story seem a bit hard to follow  because of movement back and forth in time, occasional significant scenes  too sketchily described, and lack of important history (especially Sunny's  childhood).  Nevertheless, the novel succeeds in its beautiful use of  language and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions as it poignantly  examines one man's feelings.  It is an attention-getting, fascinating  story, especially about the comfort girls of the Japanese Imperial Army  during World War II.

This is a candid and heartwarming account of how one family deals with the issue of racial differences.  The author reveals how his mother, despite her different physical appearance from others in her African-American  community and her continual shortage of adequate income, thrives and  encourages her children to excel through decent values and using education  as the key to self-improvement. Despite the fact that the parallel stories  at times become confusing, the story is one of family pride demonstrated by  the success of the twelve children in their adult lives.  I feel saddened,  though, that the author's glimpse into his Jewish background was  perfunctory at best.  As the son of a Jewish woman, Jewish law considers  him fully a Jew despite his having been raised Christian and living a  Christian life.  There is so much more he could have learned of his Jewish  background had he taken the time to explore it.	2000-04-01

The deeply personal philosophy that Morrie shares with Mitch makes a beautiful story. It accentuates the positive forces of love and life as well as reinforces the fact that dying is as natural as being born.  Morrie's message is not to fear death nor isolate the dying person but  rather realize that one remains alive during the dying process and that  companionship and love should be shared with anyone facing an impending  death. Bravo to Morrie for unabashedly presenting his story to the world  and to Mitch for not being embarrassed to reveal that a young man can be so  profoundly moved by a mentor from his youth!	2000-03-29

With heart-rending honesty, Lardner recounts the tragedy that turned his picture-perfect life into a horrendous nightmare. Lardner's daughter, an art student in Boston,  was murdered by a  disgruntled boyfriend who first  stalked her and then shot her dead.   The beginning of the book is great.   The dad speaks with candor about his love for and his frustrations with his  daughter from the time she was a young girl through her college years.  She  grew up in Chevy Chase, a suburb of Washington, D.C., a setting very  familiar to me.  The author had me laughing out loud and crying real tears  before I was barely into the book at all yet.  He reported on the details  of his daughter's tragic death as well as the sad state of affairs in the  United States which allows hardened criminals back on the streets to  quickly become repeat offenders. Lardner recalls the story of murderer  Michael Cartier's youth and the criminal record he accumulated during his  short but turbulent life.<br />This is not a book for everyone due to it  intense subject matter, but it was nonetheless quite engrossing to me.   Good writing.  Incredibly sad story.  The story Lardner presents of  Cartier,  is quite frightening.  It demonstrates the lengths to which a  criminal's right's are protected by the United States criminal justice  system versus the appalling lack of consideration given to a victim's right  to safety and freedom from fear.  What made the book all the more creepy  was that, during the few weeks it took me to finish the book, a  murder  under similar circumstances occurred in a suburb of Washington, D.C.  The  March, 2000, Washington Post article which ran the news story (\\"Md. Man  Gets Life Term in Girlfriend's Slaying\\" by Ruben Casteneda) ended by saying  of the killer's girlfriend \\"A month before the shooting, she filed assault  and kidnapping charges against him after he allegedly abducted her at  knifepoint, but the arrest warrant was never served.\\"  Some things never  change.	2000-03-27

Although it seems drawn out at times, the pacing seems to echo the tempo of life with a developmentally disabled child and the feeling that life needs to move  forward.  It parallels the idea that the more mundane tasks of care to such  a child take up a mother's lifetime rather than a limited number of years.   The story clearly presents a tug-of-war that can happen within a marriage  as issues of location of a home, choice of a vocation, and family  relationships differ between husband and wife.  The frequent use of the N  word and the description of the lack of dignity afforded to the black  families of Mississippi make for difficult reading albeit within the  context of history.  The author is able to effectively portray a woman's  point of view as he eloquently describes all of the dreams, fears, and  anguish  Jewel feels as she  experiences life's rewards and challenges.	2000-03-27

This book is presented as the male version of Reviving Ophelia.  It addresses what our society needs to do to allow \\"real boys\\" to be free of \\"gender straight-jacketing\\", a term used by the author to denote those actions and feelings to be avoided by boys in our society so as not to be  considered effeminate.  The author also addresses the \\"mask\\" of boys.  He  identifies this as the denial of those actions and feelings used by boys to  avoid feelings of shame brought on by others' knowledge of anything deemed  less than truly masculine.<br />Some excellent ideas are presented.  There are  two chapters which, I feel, contain particularly valuable information.  The  first is how schools can assist boys who are \\"acting out\\" in an effort to  assuage their emotional pain. The second is how others can help boys who  are feeling the pain of their parents' divorce.  Those chapters and others  describe causes of emotional pain, symptoms, and measures that can be taken  to deal with problems specific to boys.  All of the text is inextricably  bound up with the idea of \\"gender straight-jacketing\\".  A more heavy-handed  editor could have made this book much easier to read.  I feel much of the  information is repetitive and long-winded.  Nevertheless, the important  information contained in the book makes it  worthwhile reading despite this  unfortunate drawback.	2000-03-07

My favorite was Tupelo, Simon's talking pet dog.  The author used a unique and flip kind of humor to tell his tale.  I found it  intriguing, but often felt that he was talking to other men rather than a  coed group of readers.  Nevertheless this was one of those thrilling \\"I  can't put it down til I'm done&quot; page turners.  I'm truly saddened that  the author is no longer alive to write many more such thrillers.  This book  was a joy to read.	2000-02-27

The series of events that led to the marriage of Meihong Xu and Larry Engelmann and Meihong's flight from China were related in a most heart-quickening way. It brought my pity for her  naivet in the beginning, but later awe for her mettle. An eye-opening look  at the Chinese political sytem during the Chinese Cultural Revolution  caused feelings of disbelief and disgust, but also a sense of gratitude for   personal rights guaranteed by other political systems throughout the free  world.  The unexpected ending to this book brought tears to my eyes and a  bit of sadness as well.	2000-02-21

Although the story was compelling and I wanted to like it, I found several things quite disagreeable.  I thought the characters of Kathy and Lester were despicable.  I could  neither empathize with either of them nor could  I feel sorry for their involvement in the unfortunate predicaments of their  own making.  The author's use of first person for relating the story of  Kathy and Colonel Behrani, while reverting to third person for Lester's  story, was unnecessary and confusing.  I also didn't particularly like the  author's portrayal of a woman's psyche.  He didn't get it right.   Nevertheless, I did consider the portrayal of the Farsi Colonel Behrani and  his family, complete with Persian customs, fascinating and very real.   I  also found  myself identifying closely with Esmail, Colonel Behrani's son,  who had the misfortune of becoming involved in a terrifying situation.	2000-02-10

Supported by knowledge of recent research, the author provides insight into how people sometimes behave differently on the Internet than they do in real life.  According to Wallace, behaviors based on psychology in real  life often do not carry over into the virtual world in the same way.  For  frequent users of the Internet, this information is not startling but  eye-opening.  For those who use the Internet little or not at all, this is  a well-presented introduction to the cyberworld.  Although academic in  tone, the book is easy to read as it explores the many facets of life on  the \\"Net\\".  Because it is based on clinical research, it gets a bit  wearying near the end.  However, be sure to read it in its entirety because  it is well presented, very inclusive, and quite interesting.

Unlike the breath-taking, heart-stopping action of Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, Breashears takes his readers into his own psyche--that of a man driven by a sense of challenge, but with knowledge and discipline.  One can only marvel at Breashear's accomplishments in the  fields of climbing and film-making.  His many colleagues who shared his  lifetime of adventure also merit a sense of awe.  There was one piece of  Breashears life story that left me a bit uncomfortable, though.  Was the  beautiful Veronique truly that unimportant to his life to deserve just a  passing mention?

Bryson loves to throw in tidbits of information on all aspects of  his trail environment.  Katz is an incredibly funny individual (although  I'm not sure I'd choose him as a hiking partner if I had a strenuous trail  to hike and needed a reliable partner).

What amazes me about Hamilton's writing is that she can take this mundane family, very much down-and-outers, and skillfully bring them to life with her terrific prose. For 90% of the book, nothing much happens, but thoughts  and feelings are so eloquently expressed.  The ending is bit flawed in that  I feel cheated by not knowing what happens to the characters we grew to  know so well as well as how life will turn out for Ruth's children.

The 16-year-old narrator of this book is Culver who is taken away from his stepfather by his mother to live in a small Oregon town near his uncle Jake.  Three mysterious murders complicate the story.  What makes it more  complicated is a sense of not knowing where the action is going, what the  plot is.  It's kinds of like getting lost in the woods to learn about the  wooded environment rather than take a walk on the forest path.  The end of  the book is captivating.  To get to this breathtaking ending, I had to  force myself through 3/4 of the way through this book with a sense of not  even being sure what the story was about!   After I made it to the end, I  realized that the book was not about Culver, but rather about his uncle  Jake as well as Jake's relationship with the things around him; nature,  natural disasters, women, his nephew Culver, the surrounding native  American population, his small town buddies, and Jake's occupations  (running a store and conducting river tours).

Ile's characters are well developed and interesting.  The pace of the story makes the reader want to turn the pages faster and faster.  Suspense continues to build until a thrilling (but somewhat confusing) climax is reached.  Do read it!	1998-06-23

I stopped once, but was encouraged to finish it by others who have liked it.  I'm sorry to say that I never found the story very exciting.  I thought the action was less than believable and did not feel an affinity for any of the characters.	1998-06-11

Light and easy-to-read, Abraham's novel peeps into the fascinating culture of Chasidic Judaism.  I especially loved reading about how Rachel handled the situation in which she was forced to meet the young man selected by the matchmaker to be her future husband.  Though very well written, I felt it ended too abruptly.  I wanted to read much more about Rachel's life.  I do hope that Ms. Abraham continues to provide the public with stories which share this very special culture with the world at large.	1998-06-01

Written very effectively in the female voice by a male author, the novel purposely tweaks the reader with such items of the past as black-and-white TV, test patterns, Ed Sullivan, and S&amp;H green stamps.  My only criticism is that the book seems to run in spurts of everything goes wrong, then everything right, then everything wrong, and then everything right!  Maybe life's like that, but my feeling is that good and bad times seem to intertwine more often than this books idicates.  I did find Lamb's writing style pleasant and easy to read.	1998-05-23

In this rich, nostalgic, yet deeply disturbing novel, Atwood touches upon the special moments and inevitable cruelties that are part of childhood friendships.  I was fascinated by the character of Cordelia, Elaine's childhood friend.  However, I was distressed to find that, somewhere in the middle of the book, I lost track of Cordelia and her influence on Elaine's life.  This made the last half of the book anticlimatic for me because I didn't find the other characters half as interesting as Cordelia. <br />I'm still not sure that I like Atwood's method of storytelling in which she relates the very dramatic parts of her novel in the same even tone as the most mundane event.  It's an interesting writing technique, but I don't think it's for me.	1998-05-13

It compels the reader to consider the consequential ethical/moral implications of this rather new medical specialty.  The author's writing style is rather simple, but the end of the book is a thrilling, action-packed adventure!  The story will not only leave the reader wondering about the almost indistinguishable line between life and death, but also whether the control of life and death is slowly passing from deity to human.	1998-04-08

This is a superb novel, simply told, yet haunting in its imagery and sensuality.  One can feel the power and elegant beauty of the snowstorm which pervades the entire novel.  Not only does the story capture the reader's interest in trying to unravel the mystery of the death, but it also sparks a desire to learn about the Japanese culture in greater depth.	1998-03-29

Told with tenderness, humor, and just the right touch of fantasy, Shalev has fashioned a wonderful novel.  The characters are vivid and imaginative.  The descriptions of nature are enchanting.  The story itself is a metaphor for the way in which the Zionist dream has played itself out among successive generations.  Don't miss it!	1998-03-21
