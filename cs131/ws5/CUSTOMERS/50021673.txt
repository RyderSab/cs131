It is not a good stand alone book though.<br /><br />I first read this book about six months ago and found it to be pretty mediocre.  I had heard good things about this series so decided to give the author another try.<br /><br />When I did so, I started back with 'Rain Fall'.  It is the first book in the series.  I really enjoyed it, so I decided to give 'Hard Rain' another try.  This time I found it to be very good.<br /><br />The difference in my two times through this book is that 'Hard Rain' is not written in a style that is good for someone who hasn't already read the first book in the series.  There are far too many passing references to situations in 'Rain Fall'.  There are also entirely too many parts of the central characters that were developed in the previous book that are not reiterated in this one well enough to be understandable without the background.<br /><br />Although some authors are great at going through critical elements of previous books so new readers aren't at a disadvantage (W.E.B. Griffin comes to mind), Mr. Eisler is not there yet.<br /><br />I recommend this book only for those who have already read 'Rain Fall' and enjoyed it.  If you haven't done that, I suggest skipping this one.	2005-10-05

Of course, the Bush administration never claimed that there was.  What it does contain is a lot of evidence linking Hussein to various international terrorist groups.  In a post 9/11 world, the question becomes this:  Would any responsible administration ignore strong ties between a brutal thug like Hussein who regularly threatened U.S. interests and various terrorist organizations who routinely threaten the U.S.<br /><br />The author certainly does a good job at documenting links between the Hussein regime with al Qaeda.  The thing that he does even better is proving the blatantly partisan nature of the establishment news media.  He also does a strong job of showing the way that various politicians have changed their position on the major issue in this book depending upon who is in the White House.  Many politicians including Bill Clinton, John Kerry, the French Foreign Minister and the UN Weapons Inspectors made statements linking Hussein to WMDs.  Then, when there is a president in the White House whom they despise, they change their tunes and claim that the WMD issue was phony.<br /><br />Those who are strongly anti Bush may simply discard the author's case.  Those who are open minded will see that the administration did have some significant reasons to make the case against Iraq.	2005-09-27

I just happened to run across it and decided to check it out.  It turned out to be a pretty good find.<br /><br />The story features a Boston reporter, Jack Flynn, who gets involved in a wide range of happenings including the following:  the murder of his publisher, the suspicious death of the previous publisher of his paper, the alleged false reporting of one of his colleagues, and the nomination of his state's governor to be the U.S. Attorney General.<br /><br />Brian McGrory wove these various elements into a well done thriller.  One annoyance I encountered was the author's propensity to switch between first and third person during the course of the story.  It wasn't a major distraction, but is an area that he might want to work on in future works.<br /><br />I would recommend this.  It will keep the reader's attention engaged quite well.	2005-09-20

I have read most of his books and they are outstanding as a rule.  This one is very good, but it is not in a class with most of his previous efforts.<br /><br />It starts off strongly with a pair of investigators, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, working to prove that their client did not commit a burglary with which he has been charged.  During the course of their investigation they get entwined with a serial murder spree that has some connections to the burglary.  Soon they are deputized and thoroughly involved in attempting to solve the series of murders.<br /><br />There is a lot of action in this story and it is well done for the most part.  There were some unbelievable parts, however.  In one scene, two bullets collided in mid air, thus sparing their intended targets and creating a mini fireworks show.  Another story line that didn't work involved King and Maxwell being involved in relationships that mirrored each other too much in an unbelievable way.  I hesitate to elaborate on that as I don't want to risk spoiling part of the story line.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that it is a story that will keep the reader entertained and is worth the time.	2005-09-17

Unfortunately, this book has some flaws and certainly could have been better.<br /><br />Mr. De Becker is clearly an expert at teaching about manipulation, grooming, and other patterns of behavior that often precede violence.  He does a great service in explaining techniques used by antisocials and ways to counteract them by following our instincts.<br /><br />On the down side, the book contains a lot of anti-gun propaganda.  The author tends to make unsubstantiated claims about how having a gun makes one less safe.  He uses a couple of examples while ignoring the hundreds of cases annually where individuals with weapons have saved their own lives or those of others.<br /><br />Additionally, he tends to do a lot of self promotion for his company and name dropping of the ultra leftist elites of Hollywood.  Although it may impress some readers that he has connections with Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Streisand, it certainly does nothing to enhance his credibility.  On the contrary, it makes him appear to be a liberal with an agenda.  In this case, that is making people less self reliant for their own protection while promoting his company.  That is unfortunate as it takes away from the rest of the book that is so good.<br /><br />In spite of the propaganda and self promotion, I would encourage people to read this book.  It has a lot of good to go along with the bad parts.  It might just help save the life of someone who is involved with an abusive partner or dealing with a stalker.	2005-09-14

It got over far too quickly for me.<br /><br />Dr. Woods does a terrific job of correcting many of the historical fallacies that are taught in public schools.  Those who are hard core partisans will probably not care for his painful truths as both Republican and Democrat figures are exposed for their ineptitudes.<br /><br />Some of the areas that he educates readers so well on are these:  Antitrust laws have harmed consumers; every military endeavor we have been involved in since WWII has been unconstitutional (no declaration of war by Congress); Herbert Hoover's policies that led to the Great Depression were not because he was a free market advocate, but because of his big government policies.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read by any American who is interested in the truth about history, rather than the politically correct propaganda that is so often portrayed as history.<br /><br />I just hope that the author follows this up with a much more comprehensive work dealing with many more aspects of our history.  I would not only highly recommend this; I think it is a must read.	2005-09-04

The concept is quite simple.  The Fair tax would replace a myriad of other taxes that are currently paid by all Americans with a single consumption tax.<br /><br />This would eliminate the following:  personal and corporate income taxes, the Social Security tax, Medicare taxes, death taxes, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, self employment taxes, the alternative minimum tax, as well as all tax audits.<br /><br />One thing that the authors do extremely well here is expose many of the deceptions of the current system.  They show how there are currently numerous embedded taxes contained in all products and services that are bought.  Studies have shown that these hidden taxes amount to about 22% of the cost of an item or service.<br /><br />The Fair Tax would do away with all of the hidden taxes and replace them with a single consumption tax of 23%.  Although this sounds high, it would actually be pretty much a 'wash' with the embedded taxes.  Prices would come down due to the competition of the marketplace and all taxes would be paid at the point of sale.<br /><br />No longer would workers have huge percentages of their wages taken out in payroll taxes.  They would keep 100% of their wages.  Also, there would not be any hassle leading up to April 15 every year.<br /><br />Additionally, the costs of compliance for the current tax system are in the hundreds of billions.  After those costs are no longer necessary, costs will come down even more.<br /><br />Interest rates would likely lower significantly as well.  Lenders are subject to the same payroll costs and other hidden taxes as everyone else.  When their costs go down, the competition of the marketplace is likely to force rates lower.<br /><br />The fair tax would clearly give us a much broader tax base, which would ease the burden on everyone.  The plan also includes a provision for 'prebates' which would cover the Fair Tax costs on basic necessities for all citizens.  This would eliminate any harm that could possibly come to the poor under this change.<br /><br />As the authors say: \\"It's about an economy growing so fast that you'll have to hide under your bed to avoid a job.\\"<br /><br />This would make a huge difference in the future of the Social Security system also by making it much more solvent.  As Boortz and Linder say:  \\"The best way to reform Social Security, after all, might be to bring about an aging population that doesn't need it.\\"<br /><br />This idea is truly revolutionary.  It could be the key to solving the retirements fund crisis for baby boomers, provide explosive job growth and opportunity in our nation, and restore privacy to financial transactions.<br /><br />If you only read one book on any sort of public policy issue this year, this should be the one.  The benefits of this change would be incredible to everyone in our nation.<br /> <br />The fair tax would clearly give us a much broader tax base, which would ease the burden on everyone.

It will appeal to martial artists, fans of Chuck's movies and TV career, Christians, and anyone else who enjoys reading about a life of struggle culminating in major achievement.<br /><br />Starting off in life with a very dedicated mother and an alcoholic and often absentee father, Mr. Norris went on to become a 6 time world middleweight karate champion.  His introduction to the martial arts was in Korea while he was stationed there in the U.S. Air Force.  His training regimen during his stay in Korea was very hardcore.  He trained in Tang Soo Do for 5 hours per day, 6 days per week and then he trained in Judo on Sundays.<br /><br />Throughout the story, he traces his spiritual journey; he is now a committed Christian.  He is also very open about his flaws. It also covers the development of his KICKSTART program, which has been highly beneficial to teenagers.<br /><br />Some may not like his political commentary.  He is a conservative.  He also touches on some encounters with the families of the current and formers presidents Bush.<br /><br />This is an inspirational account of a very interesting American.

It was entertaining with a good plot and interesting characters for the most part.  The last third of the story was quite predictable with plot lines that paralleled earlier events far too closely for believability.  That being said, it was the author's first novel so I would rate it very highly as a debut.<br /><br />Set mostly in Afghanistan, it covered time frames from the monarchy days in the early 70s through the Soviet invasion/occupation up through the Taliban times.<br /><br />It focuses strongly on relationships:  friends, brothers, father/son, master/servant.  There are incidents of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption.  The characters are well developed.  It contains a lot of background on the daily life in Afghanistan from different perspectives.  There are also lots of insights into life there under the brutal regimes of the Soviets and the Taliban.<br /><br />This book will likely appeal to a wide variety of readers.  It is a quick read and very enjoyable.	2005-08-17

Neither is particularly well done, but they are adequate if one doesn't have anything else to read at the moment.<br /><br />I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Jonathan Kellerman's novels.  He is a first rate author who normally does a superb job with character development and writing a good story.  I haven't had the occasion to read any of Faye Kellerman's books previously.<br /><br />Although they both may be very good authors on their own, this collaboration left something to be desired.  The characters are not well developed and the plots are thin and anticlimactic.<br /><br />The Santa Fe story has somewhat better developed characters than the Boston story, but neither is too great.<br /><br />I would recommend skipping this one or at least picking it up at a library or used book store.	2005-08-12

It is very simple, but well done.<br /><br />In contrast to what one reviewer wrote, this has nothing to do with being divisive.  It is not written for the population at large.  It is written to Christians specifically letting them know what God has said that they need to do in their own lives to turn things around in our nation.<br /><br />Mr. Lucado goes through II Chron. 7:14 phrase by phrase.  The text of that Scripture is as follows:  \\"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\\"<br /><br />The solution found in this single verse is really quite simple.  Christians need to do the following:  1)  Acknowledge God, the Creator of the Universe, and his dominion;  2)  Pray; 3) Seek His face - Read His word, worship Him, etc.; 4)  Confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.<br /><br />The simplicity of the verse is amazing.  The book is well done.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to Christians.	2005-08-08

She is a very worthy subject of a good biography.  Unfortunately, this book by Antonia Felix is not it.<br /><br />This is little more than a 240 page resume for Dr. Rice that could have been compiled by almost anyone.  It is a \\"biography\\" that lacks even an interview with the subject herself as a source.  It is frankly a substandard effort.<br /><br />Ms. Felix did an adequate job of outlining several major parts of Dr. Rice's history including the following:  Her formative years in segregated Birmingham, her college years, her years working in academia, and her governmental service.  Although those elements are interesting and show what a highly accomplished person Dr. Rice is, the book does not really show us the person.  The author addressed the significant impact that Dr. Rice's parents had in her life, but she barely mentions any other person who has been influential with the exception of one college professor at the University of Denver.<br /><br />This work also does little to address the ideas, philosophy, and policy views of the Secretary of State.  This seems like a very odd ommission given that she is often mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.  The only policy position that was given more than a passing reference is her opposition to gun control (developed during troubling years in the South where racist local politicians ran roughshod over Black Americans).<br /><br />One hopes that some author will do a proper biography on this highly accomplished and very impressive woman.	2005-08-07

Those who have read the previous Potter books will likely enjoy this one.<br /><br />It is not as well done as some of the other books.  There are some plot lines that are nonsensical.  For instance:  Dumbledore, who is supposed to be so wise and discerning fails to see what any semi astute reader or character in the series should be able to see about one of the darker characters.  To avoid spoiling the plot, I won't go further on this point.  Suffice it to say, it will be crystal clear to readers well before the end of this book and was probably evident somewhere in book one.<br /><br />Although it is a pleasant read for those who have read the series from the beginning, it is not done well enough to be a stand alone volume.  Those who have not read the previous installments will be lost by the lack of explanations of events.<br /><br />The best thing about 'The Half Blood Prince' is the setup for the next book.  There are certainly several plots left open for follow up in book seven.<br /><br />Readers who have enjoyed the whole series up to this point will likely enjoy this.  Those who have not read the others should start at the beginning and not jump right into this one.	2005-08-04

He provides some much needed insight into these areas.<br /><br />Although he discusses several issues here, the two primary things that he looks at are the Democrats' (he is one) wimpy response to terrorism and the increasing hostility toward religion in our society.  He does a great job at outlining some serious problem areas.  He also provides a few specific soutions.<br /><br />One of his observations is:  \\"Today, at the same time young Americans are dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrat's manic obsession to bring down our commander in chief.\\"<br /><br />Anyone who has observed the political climate over the last few years can tell that bashing George W. Bush and anything he does is the number one activity of partisan Democrats now.  Virtually every nominee he has proposed for a judgeship or any other position has been viciously attacked and had his/her character assassinated.  The only exception to that that I can think of since Bush took office is Colin Powell.<br /><br />Miller compares this current ugly climate to the way Democrats and Republicans have stayed united during times of war.  He cites various examples of pro American wartime leadership of the past including Truman and FDR.  He contrasts these examples with the current crop of the 'Blame America first' crowd.<br /><br />One other issue that he addresses very well it the 'Fair Tax' proposal which would eliminate countless hidden taxes and lower the amount taken from the taxpayers.<br /><br />Miller is a class act.  His book has some much needed ideas and should be read by all.	2005-07-29

It is also very biased.  It should probably be called the 'Politically Correct Guide to American History'.<br /><br />It covers a wide range of events in U.S. history from the earliest explorers to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Potential readers should be aware that the writer has a very leftist slant to his presentation.<br /><br />To be fair, history is one of those topics that is typically influenced heavily by the writer's perspective.  Mr. Davis takes his liberal evangelistic crusade seriously and includes his biases in virtually every historical era covered.<br /><br />A few examples of this are outlined below:<br /><br />The author practically deifies Franklin Roosevelt.  Anyone who has any grasp of history at all knows that Mr. Roosevelt sold out eastern Europe and much of Asia to the Soviets causing decades of tyranny and misery for the inhabitants of those nations.  His 'New Deal' has also been a major cause of problems for countless Americans by making them dependent upon Big Brother.  Probably no other administration deserves as much scorn as does that of Roosevelt for the creation of the welfare state.<br /><br />One of the most blatant areas of bias and flat out dishonesty is found on page 584.  In discussing America at the year 2000, Davis claims:  \\"America's poorest children have a lower standard of living than those in the bottom 10 percent of any other nation except Britain.\\"  It is rare to see such a total falsehood in print.  Even the most biased writers usually try to be a bit more subtle with their phony claims.  Anyone who has ever traveled outside of the United States knows that Davis' statement is false.  To give him the benefit of the doubt, I suppose it is possible that he has never traveled anywhere and doesn't know any better, but I doubt it.  If that is the case, he shouldn't be making such bogus claims.<br /><br />Another example of the bias throughout this book is his claim that 'serious black scholars' feel that the U.S. should pay reparations to descendants of American slaves.  This is perhaps one of the looniest of modern issues.  It is an effort to take money from those who never had slaves to give to those who never were slaves.<br /><br />In spite of the bias throughout, this is an entertaining book with lots of good information.  The author should work hard to improve future editions by eliminating a big chunk of his bias.  If that were done, this would deserve a significantly higher rating.throughout this book is his claim that 'serious black scholars' feel that the U.S. should pay reparations to descendants of American slaves.

There are also several who are very damaging to our nation who were not included.<br /><br />The list consists of people of all political persuasions, although far more are liberals.  But, of course, it is liberals who are doing the most damage to our culture.  I think that many of those in the slots from 80-100 could probably be left off if this is to be a top 100 list.  Of course, Mr. Goldberg doesn't call it the top 100.  He just says that these 100 are included in those who are screwing up America.<br /><br />Many of those included in this book are from the following types of people:  white collar thugs, radical feminists, those who divide by race, politicians, anti free speech academics, 'Hollywood blowhards', and  'cultural elite hypocrites'.  There are also some who don't fit in those categories.<br /><br />Several who should have probably been included in the top 20, but weren't include the following:  Supreme Court Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Sandra Day O'Connor who regularly trash the Constitution while legislating from the bench; former Attorney General Janet Reno who oversaw the slaughter of dozens of women and children at Waco as well as the heavily armed abduction of Elian Gonzales; Bill Clinton who perjured himself while president, illegally provided defense technology to the Chinese government, sold the Lincoln Bedroom and other favors for campaign cash, etc.  He was clearly one who diminished the presidency and the country; Norman Mineta who has overseen the implementation of totally inept and intrusive airline 'security procedures' which have done nothing to improve security; Harry Reid who has continued in Tom Daschle's infamous footsteps of obstructing just for the sake of obstructing; the prosecutor in the Michael Jackson case who went after an easy target with little or no evidence; and Senators Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton who have continuously poisoned the atmosphere by being shrill instead of advancing ideas.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that Mr. Goldberg did a great job.  It is his book and his personal list so he is certainly entitled to list them as he likes.

I highly recommend it.<br /><br />In contrast to so many books on this subject that read like a textbook, this is composed of a series of letters between a father who is a skeptic and his son who is a Christian.  The tone is loving and respectful throughout.<br /><br />There will certainly be many Christians who won't like this book because some of Dr. Boyd's answers will be in conflict with their own theological interpretations or denominational positions.  I am one of those who disagrees with his view on several questions.  It also contains many excellent responses.<br /><br />The value of this book far outweighs any of its weaknesses.  The bottom line is that everyone has a critical decision to make about whether or not to accept Jesus Christ.  Not making a decision is still a decision; it is rejecting Him by default and it will have eternal consequences.  As Boyd says, \\"It's like being in a house and someone outside hollers 'fire'!  You can choose to believe him or not to believe him - and you weigh the evidence carefully (do you smell smoke? do you see flames? etc.).  You can choose to believe and risk looking foolish for running out of your house if it's a joke, or you can choose not to believe and risk being burned up.  If you choose to suspend judgment, you risk the same thing. So there simply is no 'risk free' position, not even the position of not taking a position.\\"<br /><br />He goes on to say:  \\"The most reasonable thing to do, Dad is to believe!  The evidence is strong.  The alternatives are comparably weak.  And the risk of not believing is far greater than the risk of believing.  As Blaise Pascal said (in his famous 'Pascal's Wager'), if Christianity is false, you've lost nothing.  If it's true, you've lost all eternity.  Christianity, therefore, is clearly the best bet!\\"<br /><br />For anyone who is a skeptic, this may be an invaluable book in helping you to work though your doubts.

There is an ongoing narrative telling about the struggles of Heather Stone starting at age 13,  as well as those of her parents, Charles and Sherryl.  Along with their encouraging story, there are nine 'relational life preservers' to help those with similar struggles.<br /><br />There is a Christian perspective throughout this volume.  Charles is a pastor and Heather is a prodigal daughter who has returned to her roots.<br /><br />Although I have been fortunate enough to avoid most of the extremely difficult situations that Charles and his wife faced with Heather, I recommend this book for any parent of a teenager.  Even parents of teens who are not totally rebellious face many trying times through the adolescent years.  The advice given will be helpful for any parent with teenagers.	2005-07-06

That is not necessarily a bad thing; it just seems like the hype for the book doesn't really make that clear.<br /><br />Although I thought it started off a bit slow, I enjoyed it more and more as I went along.  Part of that was nostalgia.  Russert takes us back to a more relaxed and kinder time in our history for most of the book.<br /><br />The author's father, Big Russ, is a typical middle class American from the WWII generation - hardworking, loyal, patriotic.  He obviously had a big impact on his son's life, which is a very positive thing for the most part.<br /><br />Russert has generally struck me as a fairly balanced reporter, which is a real rarity among the major network news people.  His book shows that he comes from the liberal perspective that is rare these days; he is a liberal without the 'blame America first' mindset.<br /><br />He has some wise comments on perspective.  One of them is: \\"The older I get, the smarter my father seems to get.\\"  He talks with admiration about his father's generation - the group who beat the Germans and Japanese in WWII:  \\"They didn't talk about it, they just did it.\\"<br /><br />Another good observation was about current child rearing methods:  \\"I believe that parents of my generation have often failed our kids.  We are so eager to be understanding and sympathetic that we end up being too lenient, even as we further undermine the already diminished authority of teachers, coaches and principles.\\"<br /><br />One of his most revealing comments contrasted his political hero, Bobby Kennedy, with liberals of today:  \\"But with Kennedy, unlike some of the liberals who followed him, the message was never about blaming America.  He insisted that we were a great country, but that we could do better.\\"<br /><br />Russert reviews several life lessons that are good including sections on respect, faith, work, fatherhood, and discipline.  Perhaps the best section was on loss (death).<br /><br />This may not be a great book, but it is a worthwhile one.loss (death). <br /> <br />This may not be a great book, but it is a worthwhile one.	2005-07-04

I also think that she would be a terrible president due to her policy views, her lack of character, and her administrative incompetence (health care task force). I read the book because she is highly touted as being the next Democrat nominee for president and could even be elected, which is very scary. Her political potential made this a book of interest to me.<br /><br />Although Klein has a highly credentialed history as a journalist, this book is not very good. It contains little that is new. The revelations that are new are not well documented. It also focuses far too much on the personal life of Hillary, rather than the public side.  That is not only of no interest to me, I'm sure it's of little interest to many others.<br /><br />An example of an area that is too personal and not relevant to the public side of Ms. Clinton is the author's attribution of Chelsea's birth to a rape that Bill perpetrated on Hillary. His \\"evidence\\" for this is a couple of statements that someone recalled Bill making twenty five years ago. There is no statement from the alleged victim (Hillary) ever claiming that there had in fact been a rape.  This seems like an unnecessary and irrelevant intrusion on the Clinton's married life.<br /><br />Another example is Klein's belief that Hillary knew that Bill had raped Juanita Broadrick. Most are familiar with Broadrick's credible allegation that Bill raped her. In a poor display of evidentiary evaluation, Klein related a conversation that Broadrick claimed to have had with Hillary that supposedly convinced her that Hillary knew of the alleged rape and thanked Broadrick for her \\"services\\" to Bill. The so called evidence presented for this is slim to say the least.<br /><br />There are some good elements in this book. The author does a decent job of documenting some lies, hypocrisy, and past activities that are relevant to Hillary as a political figure. He also does a good job of showing a pattern of chameleon like behavior that Hillary has used to gain political advantages.<br /><br />Klein outlines some of the extreme leftist views that Hillary has pushed over the years. He also demonstrates how she has been trying to reshape her image, at the expense of the truth, to position herself for a presidential run.<br /><br />I think that voters should read this to become more familiar with Hillary's history. That being said, those who read it should be aware that they're unlikely to find any new information that is particulary significant. It might be more prudent to either wait for the paperback or get it from the library.  Those who really want to know the truth about Hillary may want to read 'Hell to Pay' by Barbara Olson.

It is an important one to read due to the extreme ambition that Hillary Clinton has combined with the infatuation the establishment press has with her.  That combination makes her a strong possibility for the Democratic nomination for president in 2008, if not winning the election.<br /><br />The author gives a thorough examination of the real Hillary Clinton.  She reviews some events of her formative years but really focuses on her life from her college days through the White House years.  She includes a great deal of material exposing Clinton's extremist politics, her phoniness, and her ethical shortcomings.  Additionally she touches on a bit of looniness as well as the extreme cunning that she has as a political operator.<br /><br />The phoniness is illustrated in several ways.  Two of these will be touched upon briefly here.  One is the infamous baby story.  Everyone who remembers the 1996 presidential race will recall how Hillary was claiming that she and Bill were hoping to adopt another child.  Of course, that never happened.  Nor was it ever going to happen.  It was clearly a manipulation to attempt to make Mrs. Clinton appear to be more human.  Another was her claim to be a lifelong Yankees fan when she started running for the U.S. Senate from New York.  Anyone who believes that had better be concerned about his/her gullibility.<br /><br />Another area that is explored well is Ms. Clinton's extremism.  Ms. Olson does an excellent job of recounting her radicalism in areas including the following: liberation theology, advocating for children to be able to sue their parents, defending Black Panther murderers, and the advocacy of giving much more parental control to government bureacrats.<br /><br />Most are well aware of many of Clinton's ethical transgressions.  For those who are not, the author gives a thorough recounting of the senator's dishonest dealings ranging from her involvement with the misused FBI files to her connection to the infamous pardons for cash scheme that her brother and husband perpetrated, as well as numerous others.  The chronicling of these activities alone is well worth the price of the book.  The brief version is that Hillary Clinton makes Richard Nixon look like a model of integrity.<br /><br />For those who have forgotten, Ms. Olson gives an account of Hillary's seances to contact Eleanor Roosevelt.  Does anyone hear 'The Twilight Zone' theme playing right now?<br /><br />Although all of the above are done very well and are important information, the most important part of this book is the explanation of how Hillary and her husband used a triangulation strategy to turn public opinion around for them and against their opponents over the years.  Keen observers will note that she is doing this again now with the illegal alien issue and others.  She is doing her best to come across as a serious terrorist fighter even though her husband's record (when she was 'co-president) was surely anything but strong against terror.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for any thoughtful voter who will likely be considering Ms. Clinton as a possible presidential candidate in the near future.  This book is far superior to the current hot seller by Edward Klein.  'Hell to Pay' concentrates far more on the public part of Clinton and much less on the personal than Klein does.with the misused FBI files to her connection to the infamous pardons for cash scheme that her brother and husband perpetrated, as well as numerous others.

Upon leaving work one night, he finds a note on his SUV that says:  \\"If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher somewhere in Napa County.  If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work.  You have six hours to decide.  The choice is yours.\\"<br /><br />Wiles shares the note with his buddy who is a deputy sheriff.  They both view the note as a sick joke.  The deputy, Lanny Olsen, does not share the note with anyone in his department.  After the first victim is killed, Olsen and Wiles both realize that their failure to officially report the threat has gotten them in a bind.<br /><br />The action just escalates from this point.  There are more notes, more victims, and lots of action and suspense.  My only criticism is that the ending is a bit anticlimactic.  Even that is not a huge problem with this book as the rest of it is so captivating.<br /><br />This book will not disappoint those who are looking for a fast paced thriller.  I recommend it.	2005-06-25

This work is particularly valuable to those who do not have the good fortune to have an instructor who is a traditionalist.  Those martial artists who have such a teacher have undoubtedly gotten a dose of most of the best of this volume.  Those without such a mentor will doubly benefit from Morgan's instruction.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of this book as I see it:<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />1.  Lots of interesting history.<br /><br />2.  Excellent material on the ethical principles, loyalty, honor, etc.<br /><br />3.  Philosophical roots of the martial arts.<br /><br />4.  The benefits of training, particularly as it applies to seeking ecellence in other areas of one's life.<br /><br />5.  A good section on strategy and tactics.<br /><br />6.  Excellent commentary on internal vs. external motivations.<br /><br />7.  A good response to religious based objections to martial arts training.<br /><br />The Not So Good<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />1.  Too much discussion of 'face' including some rationalization for inappropriate responses to a loss of face.<br /><br />2.  Some discussion of revenge and suicide that should have been treated strictly as historical instead of some weak justification of these as applied to the modern world.<br /><br />3.  The author is rather elitist in his view of warriors being superior to pretty much everyone else on the planet.  Although this part included some good observations, it was overdone.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book for any martial artist.  Additionally, I think that a lot of the information would be interesting and valuable even to non 'warriors'.	2005-06-15

He uses a story form to educate the readers on the problems with typically inflicted governmental action in about 25 areas  including the following:  government 'make work' projects, taxes, credit, machinery, reductions in numbers of government employees, tariffs, price fixing, subsidizing commodities, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, and attacks on savings.<br /><br />As politicians around the world, including the United States, regularly make harmful errors in their attempts to buy votes, this should be required reading for all of them, as well as college economics professors who are so enamoured with Keynes and Marx.<br /><br />Hazlitt does a great job in making the case that, prior to taking action on economic issues, decision makers should look at the effect on everyone involved (not just the groups that they are trying to seduce into voting for them) as well as the long range implications of the policy.<br /><br />Readers should come away from reading this with a clear understanding of the marvels of a free market (if we were ever allowed to have one) and the incredibly damaging effects of governmental manipulations of the economy.  I would strongly  recommend this for reading by all voters who want to be knowlegeable as well as all elected and appointed officials.	2005-06-09

He worked as a reporter for CBS News for 28 years.  Toward the end of this career, he had an eye opening experience that made him really look at how the major broadcast networks operate in a biased manner.<br /><br />Goldberg is a self admitted liberal.  He indicated that he had voted for McGovern and the other Democrat presidential candidates over the years.  His detractors certainly cannot claim that he is some sort of Republican or conservative with an axe to grind. He comes across as an honest reporter (Is that an oxymoron?) who wanted to see his employer and the rest of the national media rid themselves of bias and regain credibility with the public.<br /><br />He credits the one sided worldview of the media giants as the reason for the unprecedented success that Rush Limbaugh and others in talk radio have had in recent years.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Goldberg uses numerous examples to make his case.<br /><br />Regarding the extent of the bias, he said that as far as he could tell John Stossel is the only reporter in the big three broadcast networks who routinely challenges the liberal wisdom on a wide range of issues.  He also cited several surveys showing the extreme disparity in voting patterns and views on issues of media employees compared to the population at large.  He indicated that the basic criteria in the hyper competitive world of network news is: \\"Don't let the facts stand in the way of a good story.\\"<br /><br />He outlined several different ways that the bias functions such as running editorials 'masquerading as news.'  Several examples were outlined.  He also talked about labeling.  He cited example after example of those who are on the opposite side of an issue from the media elites being labeled as 'conservative' or 'right wing' by the reporters.  On the other hand, he pointed out how no liberal, no matter how extreme, is ever labeled as a 'liberal' or 'left wing'.<br /><br />The effects of this media bias are evident.  Far fewer Americans trust the media than did in years past.  Viewership of the big three has dropped dramatically.<br /><br />One page of this book makes it worth the price.  In chapter eight, Goldberg makes the whole bias crystal clear for any but the most obtuse.  He muses about how things would be totally different if almost all of the employees of the big three voted the opposite way that they do, were broadcast from the Midwest instead of Manhattan, etc.  I certainly cannot do this section justice with a recap.  Those pondering this book should get it just for pages 125 and 126 in the paperback edition, if for nothing else.<br /><br />This is an important book that should be read by everyone and discussed extensively.edia elites being labeled as 'conservative' or 'right wing' by the reporters.

It is an entertaining read with some really good character development.<br /><br />The main character in the story is Solomon 'Solo' Long, who is a mob hit man.  One of his victims is a pastor. As he is dying, the minister tells Long that he forgives him.  This simple act of Christian forgiveness rocks Long's world.  He is profoundly affected by this event and tries to make some things right as the story progresses.<br /><br />I believe this is a debut novel for Chris Well and it is a good first effort.  He does leave a couple of loose ends along the way and the action at the end is a bit anticlimactic in comparison to the earlier parts of the story.<br /><br />He does a very good job of interjecting a bit of Christian worldview without coming across as preachy.  He also ties in some contemporary culture and even some Shakespeare throughout the book.  I thought the best part was his character development of Long.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty entertaining read and a real rarity - a crime novel without tons of foul language or other non essentials.	2005-05-31

Books	5	10	19	N	N	Full of Important Information and Some Solutions	In 'Give Me A Break', John Stossel exposes numerous problems in our society and provides some solutions.  This work is well researched, well documented, and full of important information.<br /><br />During the course of this book, Stossel points out problems with both liberals and conservatives and will undoubtedly irritate both considerably.<br /><br />He takes on four of the sacred linchpins of the left:  The government, labor unions, a biased media, and trial lawyers.<br /><br />He does an excellent job of showing how government regulations and consumer 'protections' have killed businesses, cost jobs, and made things less safe.  Numerous examples are provided.  One very good one is the way that the excessive regulation of the FDA kills people.  He makes the case that 'the perfect is the enemy of the good' in showing how the regulator's goal of perfect safety costs lives of numerous people who might have been willing to risk taking a medication that they are not allowed by these 'protectors'.<br /><br />One example of the harm done by unions that he discusses is how their insistence on high salaries for even the simplest jobs costs beginners who don't end up being allowed to work in that field.<br /><br />The media is taken to task for such things as overemphasizing minor risks to hype stories, inadequate research, and always focusing on the negative.  He documents how hysterical reporting makes fears worse and leads to other problems.<br /><br />Trial lawyers are admonished for runaway lawsuits that drive up the cost of everything, cost jobs, etc.<br /><br />So called conservatives aren't left blameless in this expose either.  The miserable failures of the 'War on Drugs' and welfare for the rich are two of their areas of support that are dissected.<br /><br />He makes the great case that the exorbitant resources used in fighting drugs leaves other more serious crimes unresolved, which makes everyone less safe.  The incredible numbers of minor drug offenders targeted and incarcerated squanders resouces that could be better used dealing with rapists, murderers, burglars, and robbers.<br /><br />In his section on welfare for the rich, he gives examples of many, himself included.  The personal part involved federal flood insurance.  He makes the case that people who insist on building houses close to the ocean, rivers, etc. that are prone to flooding should not be bailed out by all of the less wealthy among us.  He mentioned how a beach house that he owned was rebuilt twice under this federal subsidy.

US	50021673	R1O2UDFZCXXRCA	B0002H7GIA	964386491	Blink	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Very Enjoyable	This is the first Ted Dekker novel that I have read and I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />The plot is farfetched.  Seth Border is a super genius who has suddenly developed an ability to see potential futures and how they will change depending upon the actions of people in the present.  Border has an encounter with a Saudi Arabian princess who was running from the oppressive life of women in that culture.  Needless to say, Border's special abilities are extremely important to the duo trying to outrun her sociopathic husband and others.<br /><br />Although the plot is outrageous in some ways, the story is exciting and contains plenty of action and suspense.  It also explores some differences between Islam and Christianity.  The author does a good job of presenting love for Muslims and their need for Christ.  He also does a superb job of exposing the radical fringes of Islam and the brutal treatment that women (even those in the privileged class of Saudi princesses) suffer at the hands of their husbands, fathers, and barbaric men in general.<br /><br />During the course of Border's gift of seeing potential futures, he has an ever deepening awareness of the nature of God, Jesus, and the power of prayer.<br /><br />I certainly intend to read more of Dekker's work and recommend this one heartily.	2005-05-24

Perhaps since he has been a judge, he does a far better job at exposing wrongs done by the legislative and executive branches than he does the judiciary.<br /><br />He is very even handed in dishing out his criticisms to both Democrat and Republican administrations.  Those who he takes to task include Bill Clinton, Janet Reno, George W. Bush, and John Ashcroft.<br /><br />His contention is that `it should be against the law to break the law'.  He reveals an ugly secret that far too few people realize in that the government regularly breaks its own laws and gets away with it.  He opines:  `Because it breaks the law, the government is not your friend.'<br /><br />Abuses by law enforcement officers and other governmental employees and agents that the judge reviews include the following:  lying, cheating, stealing, prosecuting people that the government knows to be innocent, kidnapping, and murder.<br /><br />Several of the cases that he discusses are well known such as the murder of Randy Weaver's wife and son by federal agents, the assaults and murder of 86 people including women, children, and babies by law enforcement agencies at the direction of then Attorney General Janet Reno, and the abduction of 6 year old Elian Gonzales also at Reno's instigation.<br /><br />Lesser known examples that are exposed by Napolitano include the entrapment of citizens by government agents, the fabricating of testimony in child molestation cases (also by Reno), and the bribery of witnesses on a regular basis by prosecutors.  He also goes through several appalling examples of the trampling of Constitutional protections by the Bush administration under the guise of battling the war on terror.<br /><br />Some blindly loyal partisans may be aggravated by the exposure of those of their political persuasion.  That would be a mistake as the judge has some very important things to say that need to be heard.<br /><br />The weakness in this work on governmental abuses is the lack of criticism of the judiciary.  Although he does some of that, it is insufficient.  I think that judges in general, and federal judges in particular, are perhaps the most dangerous threat to our system of government.<br /><br />Napolitano outlines some very good solutions to help with the problems listed in the book.  Included among his ideas are these:  1) Enact legislation requiring all law enforcement personnel and other government employees and/or their agents to be subject to all laws.  Citizens couldn't be prosecuted if the government has violated laws in fingering them.  2)  Make it easier to sue state and federal governments when they violate civil liberties, including removing personal immunity of governmental employees when they break the law.  3)  If a defendant is exonerated in a case where the government has violated the law, the government would be forced to pay his/her legal bills.  These ideas are a good start.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  I think everyone should read it and encourage their legislators to enact the ideas in it.  As I think he has done an insufficient job in outlining problems with the judiciary, I would also recommend that everyone read `Men In Black' by Mark Levin.tant things to say that need to be heard. <br /> <br />The weakness in this work on governmental abuses is the lack of criticism of the judiciary.

As big of a job as parenting is in today's world, we can all use reminders of even the basics.  In our fast paced world, many times our relationships with family members take a back seat to work.  That shouldn't be the case.  In this primer on parenting, Harrison helps us remember some basic things that are very valuable.<br /><br />Some of the pages deal with advice on things that are your role as a parent.  Others contain insights that will make readers smile in remembering events they have experienced in child rearing.<br /><br />Some of my favorite of the included 'lessons' are these:<br /><br />1.  Take part in her life now.  Don't wait until she's 15 to try to develop a relationship.<br /><br />2.  Tell her from day one that she can accomplish anything.<br /><br />3.  Be prepared to watch Walt Disney movies with her some 200 times.  Each.<br /><br />4.  Tickle her, play with her, give her piggyback rides.  She's not breakable.<br /><br />5.  Realize that as you shape her, she will shape you.<br /><br />6.  Read to her often.  Very soon, she'll be reading to you.<br /><br />7.  Talk to her about what she wants to be when she grows up.<br /><br />  Continally reinforce the idea that anything is possible.<br /><br />8.  When she's old enough, sign her up for karate lessons. This is more for your sake than hers.<br /><br />9.  Think before you speak.  Even when you don't mean to, you can end up hurting her feelings.<br /><br />10. Take her out of town to somewhere she's never been at least once a year.  This will develop her sense of wonder.<br /><br />11. Remember, teenage girls spend hours in their room doing something.  No man has ever really figured out what that something is.<br /><br />12. There will be days when you think you've raised an alien.  Those are the same days she feels she's being raised by one.<br /><br />13.  Remember, it's a good thing if the boys in her life think you are slightly unstable.<br /><br />Frankly, I never would have bought this for myself.  It's a very small, 'cutesy' looking book.  It's just not the type of thing that attracts my attention.  Fortunately, my wife saw it and bought it for me.  It is a real little treasure.days she feels she's being raised by one. <br />13.

I recommend both books, but they should be read in order and this is the second one.<br /><br />Rosenberg again wrote a fast paced thriller with an interesting plot and lots of twists.  The story also contains a very creative plan for Middle East peace that makes the story very unique.  Although the resources may not actually be present to make it happen like they are in the book, one can at least appreciate some of the ideas presented.<br /><br />One area that he could use some improvement is in research to make the details more accurate.  The author obviously isn't familiar with firearms as he talks about a .357 magnum having a safety and reloading it with a clip.  As a revolver, this type of pistol doesn't have a safety.  Additionally, revolvers don't use clips.  One other mistake was in describing a fire in a building, he talked about it providing enough light to see by.  When a building is on fire, it is not light inside.  It is extremely dark as the smoke prevents one from seeing much of anything.<br /><br />As this was written two years ago, it also contains some items that have occurred differently than are in the story.  That is no fault of the author.  The reader just needs to realize when the book was written that Rosenberg was portraying future events.  For example, both Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden are dead at the beginning of this book.  As we all know, Saddam is in prison and Bin Laden is hiding like the coward that he is.<br /><br />In addition to a great story line, Rosenberg makes some great points that readers would do well to ponder.  In one place, he has the former head of Mossad telling the 'hero' of the story, Jon Bennett, that 'the problem with you Americans is that you don't believe in evil'.  He goes on to explain that he believes that 'evil forces make evil men do evil things'.  He explains that this awareness of evil missing from the American perspective causes problems for us.  He said that because of this, the people at the FBI and CIA, 'and definitely the guys at State - don't properly anticipate horrible, catastrophic events because you don't really believe in the presence of evil ...'  He goes on to cite some specific events to support this contention.<br /><br />After his lesson from the Israeli, Bennett realizes that he is right.  He realized that in regard to suicide bombers and other terrorists 'weren't misguided or misunderstood.  They were controlled by evil.  Pure evil.  And evil couldn't be negotiated with.  It could only be hunted down, captured, or destroyed.'  There are some lessons in this novel that would be helpful for many in our nation to learn.<br /><br />Bennett is certainly an unlikely and really unrealistic hero.  The investment banker turned into an action hero with no training could use some work.  Regardless of that and other minor imperfections, Rosenberg has again written a terrific novel.  I look forward to his next one.d that because of this, the people at the FBI and CIA, 'and definitely the guys at State - don't properly anticipate horrible, catastrophic events because you don't really believe in the presence of evil ...'

If you are looking for great Christian fiction, this would be a great place to start.<br /><br />One issue that he really explores is what heaven is like.  If you are one of the many who has thought that Heaven may be great, but you want it to be a long time before you ever leave this wonderful Earth to go there, this book will challenge you.  Alcorn paints a picture of Heaven as such a beautiful and exciting place that it may actually create a yearning in you.  He certainly doesn't view it as a boring place with non stop harp music being played like so many preachers and Christians seem to do.<br /><br />Alcorn will give you some fresh viewpoints to ponder. I encourage you to buy this and enjoy!	2005-05-13

Along with that there are other major terrorist threats occurring.<br /><br />The story is a bit outdated now due to world events of the last couple of years. Nevertheless, it is a great concept with tons of action.<br /><br />There were a few implausible elements in the story. One thing that didn't make much sense to me was an attack on the former director the Mossad. I didn't really see the point in attacking someone who was no longer in a position of power.  But, of course, terrorists are not rational.<br /><br />Additionally, there were a couple of technical areas where a bit more research by the author would have been good. These were not things that took away from the story line a great deal, but Rosenberg is not on a par with Clancy in providing realistic details yet.<br /><br />I haven't read any of Rosenberg's other books, but I will certainly be reading 'The Last Days' which is the sequel to this one. This is an exciting book and I highly recommend it.	2005-05-12

That being said, it could certainly have been a lot better.<br /><br />I understand that it's the author's personal list and everyone has different tastes, but this one seems pretty elitist while missing some great things.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment that I have with this book is all of the expensive hotels/restaurants.  Perhaps that is what some people want, but they might be better listed in a different type of book such as 'How to Spend a Fortune While Traveling'.<br /><br />It certainly contains many of the obvious places that anyone would include in a list like this such as:  The Great Pyramids of Giza, The Okavango Delta, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Victoria Falls, Stonehenge, The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, The Outer Banks, and numerous others.  There certainly are a great many fantastic sites listed.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is only a passing reference to Kruger National Park (which should be on anyone's list), and no mention of some great spots like the Columbia River Gorge or Powell's Books in Portland (perhaps the greatest books store on the planet).<br /><br />I can even see including some hotels in a book like this such as the Raffles in Singapore.  One could even see including a really unusual one like the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone or The Prince of Wales at Waterton Natl. Park in Alberta.  There is a passing reference to the Old Faithful Inn, but it doesn't have its own entry like many of the places that were included that are probably far less interesting and certainly far more expensive.<br /><br />This book is worthwhile to own to brainstorm a great trip.  It should not be viewed as 'A Traveler's Life List' as it purports to be.	2005-05-08

In many cases the results are quite shocking.<br /><br />The bottom line is that even Christian young people today don't perceive an objective standard of morality.  Instead, they tend to view such standards as based upon individual preferences, much as the culture in general does.<br /><br />McDowell analyzes the forces that have influenced this shift going back to its roots at the end of the middle ages.  He tracks the changes through the past century including influences by the media, public schools, etc.  One of the main findings is that the changes in family structures, particularly the amounts of time that parents spend with their children since the end of WWII has created huge changes.<br /><br />This is a book that all Christian parents should read if they are concerned about passing their values on to the next generation.	2005-05-03

I think that it would also be helpful to adolescents themselves (if they would read it) in understanding some of their own behavior.<br /><br />Walsh provides a lot of information on the latest research in brain development from adolescence to adulthood and its effects on attitudes, behavior, etc.  He also discusses hormonal changes as well as cultural and other influences that are helpful in understanding the teen years.<br /><br />Along with the scientific research he provides, Dr. Walsh also compares parenting styles, discusses activities for kids that can help in the short and long term, and provides realistic ideas for parenting during these tumultuous years.  One of his particularly good suggestions is behavioral contracts.  He provides a couple of specific examples of these, which are quite good.<br /><br />One great quote that he has to start off chapter one makes it clear that surviving adolescence has been an issue for millennia:  \\"Our youth now love luxury.  They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers\\".  This is attributed to none other than Socrates in the fifth century, B.C.<br /><br />Walsh clearly defines adolescence:  \\"it begins at puberty and ends ... sometime\\".<br /><br />Interwoven with the scientific information and helpful tips, he relates some stories, funny and otherwise, that most parents of those in this age group will be able to understand.  One that I found particularly humorous related to ultra cold weather and adolescent dressing habits.  This can be found on page 214.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-05-01

It is more of the same goofy writing.<br /><br />Having really been a big fan of Mr. Patterson back when he was writing the Alex Cross novels, I am more than a bit disappointed with his writing as of late.  This one is the worst of the lot in my opinion.<br /><br />For anyone who has missed the two books on this theme cited previously, they involve a group of `bird children' who are the result of genetic experimentation that grafted avian DNA into that of humans.  The resulting `creations' are super strong humans with wings.  They can fly, etc.<br /><br />In this story, the `flock', as they call themselves, battle another group of mutants, created in the same lab, who are part wolf.  The wolf men are constantly trying to thwart the bird kids, but are defeated in totally implausible ways.<br /><br />Some of the bird kids have now developed very unusual abilities:  The leader, Max (Maximum Ride) hears a voice of someone communicating with her to save the world.  One of the other ones can now breathe underwater and one can now `see' things that have occurred in a place simply by touching objects.<br /><br />If Patterson is now trying to target the teen market, he should be advertising it that way.  There are others who do much better in that area, however, such as C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />If you are a Patterson fan from long ago, you might want to do yourself a favor and skip this one so you can remember him as the great writer that he once was.	2005-04-29

It also touches a bit upon Viv Ivins, but much less than the other two.<br /><br />As one who has enjoyed the series, I found this book to be a worthwhile addition.  However, I would not recommend it to someone who has not read the others.  I don't think it would be too great as a stand alone book.<br /><br />Additionally, it indicates that there will be two more volumes in the prequel series.  To me, that seems somewhat excessive.  I think that a bit more could have been added to this and have the pre-series history captured in one book.  As one who has read all of them, I will probably read the next two as well, but I really think that it could have been compacted somewhat.<br /><br />For anyone who is not too excited about more in this series, I would highly recommend any of the following for excellent Christian fiction:  Dominion and Deadline by Randy Alcorn and Circle of Seven and Interview with the Devil by Clay Jacobsen.	2005-04-27

I have generally thought that they were very good.<br /><br />This one certainly has some of the elements of a good thriller. It has a sociopathic mayoral candidate, a pedophilic serial killer, along with the heroics of Karp and Ciampi.<br /><br />In this particular case, the story was too long. It would have been better with less. There was a lot of rehashing of the series history. There were also some totally implausible parts. In one such case, Tanenbaum had one of the new characters, who is a ranch hand, rescuing Lucy from plummeting off of a cliff by lassoing her at the last second. It also had the extreme 'coincidence' of Lucy and Marlene being at a retreat in New Mexico battling some of the same villains that Butch was tangling with in New York without really connecting the dots very well.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is a pretty fun read that moves along at a decent pace. It would probably be better to wait for the paperback or check it out from the library though.	2005-04-24

It is highly entertaining and is well worth reading by all.<br /><br />I first read it about 20 years ago and thought it was phenomenol.  I recently reread it and thoroughly enjoyed it again.<br /><br />The basic story is about the thinkers and doers of the world going on strike when the fruits of their labors are confiscated (stolen) by the government and redistributed to those who don't produce.<br /><br />It explores the free market vs. socialism, personal responsibility, and excellence in the entertaining medium of a great novel.  It is probably longer than it needs to be as Rand tended to be a bit repetitive and had some very long speeches in the text.  Nevertheless, those only reduce its appeal a slight amount.<br /><br />I'm not an objectivist and disagree with parts of Rand's philosophy.  That being said, this work was certainly a great predictor of the future effects of socialism on the American and world economies.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in important ideas and/or entertaining novels.	2005-04-24

It is one that should really be read by everyone.<br /><br />This epic contains great characters involved in a superb story.  It contains battles of good vs. evil and has heroes and villains.<br /><br />The unabridged version is long, but well worth it.  Hugo does have some long dissertations that drag a bit at times, but overall they are just a small part of a great whole.<br /><br />Some of the events are really implausible in the way that characters encounter each other in circumstances that are extremely coincidental.  However, Hugo's story and writing are so compelling that these incidents don't take away from a great story.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading this, but aren't quite ready to take on such a lengthy novel, you may want to watch the film version featuring Liam Neeson.  It is very well done and is enough to whet the appetite.  Just don't make the mistake of stopping with the movie or you will miss something very special.	2005-04-17

He begins looking into the opinion polling industry and encounters incredible corruption in the way that results are skewed to manipulate particular outcomes of events.  During the course of his investigation, Taylor uncovers murder, kidnapping, and collusion on a grand scale.  The plot explores the effects of the polling industry on the outcome of elections, issues, etc.<br /><br />Christian characters and ideas are interwoven into the story during the course of everyday life.This is a great book for anyone who enjoys a page turner that is difficult to put down.

Books	3	1	2	N	N	Common Sense, but Nothing New	The stated purpose of this book is to help you figure out who really cares about you and who does not.  The author claims that if you do that, your life will be much better and you will probably live longer.  The rest of the book is a lot like the statements above.  It has some common sense 'wisdom', but nothing that is really new or Earth shattering.<br /><br />O'Reilly quips that problem solving is what differentiates successful people from those in the penitentiaries.  Although that may be one factor, the statement is pretty simplistic and misses several other differences.  O'Reilly states that this book will 'give you the edge'.  This claim is a bit overstated.  I didn't run across anything in this book that is much more than run of the mill advice.<br /><br />Throughout the book, he does a good job of pointing out many types of people and institutions that can be and often are not 'looking out for you'.  These include some parents, certain types of 'friends', the government, the entertainment industry, the media, the Courts, the ACLU, Jessie Jackson, the educational system, and many politicians.  There are some quite good things such as some keys that he gives for good parenting, but these are not unique to this book.  Another thing that he does hammer home quite well is the suggestion to avoid 'toxic' people whether in romantic relationships or otherwise.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed in this book as it was given to me as an audio book that I listened to while on a recent road trip.  I might have been a little less pleased had I read the book itself when I could have been reading something more worthwhile or entertaining.	2005-04-11

After all, it is written for kids and I read it with an adult perspective.  Had I been rating it myself, I would have probably given it three stars.  I discussed it with my daughter who also read it and she rated it a five, so I'm simply averaging our perspectives on the book.<br /><br />O'Reilly put forth a good effort at relating to kids on subjects that are very important to them, along with several others that may not seem as critical to younger people.  He gives decent advice in a way that is geared to reach younger people who are the intended audience.<br /><br />Many adults may find some of the advice a bit superficial, but his approach may be an effective way to reach younger readers who could be bored by an in-depth look at some of the issues.  He also includes sections of `Instant Messages' that relate some of his advice in Internet lingo that may make it more entertaining for kids.<br /><br />Some of the topics that he touches on are:  friends, bullying, parents, teachers, drugs, sports, alcohol, sex, smoking, clothing, and TV.  He also hits things like death, stereotypes, having fun, God, and helping others.<br /><br />He does a very good job of identifying `toxic' adults for the readers and giving them sound advice on avoiding them.  He also does a good job at pointing out pitfalls of certain behaviors in a way that isn't an automatic turn off to teens.  There are several of his personal experiences shared in the pages that may be helpful as object lessons.<br /><br />Although I don't think many are going to confuse O'Reilly with Solomon, his words of wisdom are much more sound than a lot of  what kids are being fed in TV, movies, music, and public schools for that matter.<br /><br />O'Reilly takes on a lot of topics that many parents avoid when discussing things with their kids.  In an ideal world, all parents would discuss issues like these with their children and give them solid advice.  Unfortunately, that doesn't happen many times.

Many judges at all levels operate with no regard for the Constitution or the limits on their power.  A very recent example is the district court judge in the Schiavo case who ignored Congress and the president when they asked for a review of the case.<br /><br />Although the framers of our Constitution did a great job at putting checks on Congress and the president, they didn't do as well in restraints on the courts.  This Constitutional `Achilles heel' has allowed the judiciary in general, and the Supreme Court in particular, to function as an oligarchy.  Five unelected, unaccountable justices on the Supreme Court have usurped power to the point that they can essentially dictate policy to the nation.<br /><br />Levin does a very good job of showing many areas where this has occurred including citing specific cases and providing hundreds of footnotes.  Some areas where the Court has acted outside the scope of its authority that Levin lists include the following:  Forcing tax money to be spent on services for illegal aliens, allowing political speech to be limited, interfering with local school operations, farm quotas, prison policies, partial birth abortion, etc.  He demonstrates how the Court has usurped authority rightly belonging to the states, Congress, and the Executive.<br /><br />I don't think that he puts enough blame on the Congress and President for allowing this to happen.  They certainly have had remedies available, but have failed to exercise them effectively.<br /><br />Another thing that Mr. Levin does very well is making it clear that these judges who usurp power have no more wisdom than anyone else and sadly, in many cases, far less.  He goes through some of the horrendous decisions of the Court such as Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, and the the McCain-Feingold Act.<br /><br />He also provides several examples of justices who stayed in power after they seemingly had dementia issues or otherwise didn't fulfill their duties appropriately.  In addition, he reviews the likes of former justices like Hugo (KKK) Black and Felix Frankfurter (who aided the career of notorious spy Alger Hiss).<br /><br />There are issues in the book with which I disagree with Mr. Levin.  For example, he seemed to be contradictory in his commentary on Korematsu v. U.S.  A main contention of the book is the problems with judicial activism and the Court not deferring to the Executive in areas in which it should.  Then he cited Korematsu, which was essentially a case where the Court did defer to FDR regarding the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during WWII.  I think that internment was terrible, but I do not think that this decision was judicial activism.  It certainly seemed to be a case of deferring to the Executive.<br /><br />Although Levin does a very good job of outlining the problems with the courts (or as the book's subtitle is `How the Supreme Court is Destroying America'), the best part of the book is the section that contains his proposed solutions.  He has cited some that are already available to Congress and the president such as limiting the jurisdiction of the courts in certain areas, impeachment, and recess appointments.  Additionally, he has suggested Constitutional amendments allowing a Congressional override of Supreme Court decisions with a 2/3 vote of Congress and limiting the terms of federal judges to twelve years.  For those who want to be able to keep a particularly outstanding judge, he suggests making them eligible to be reappointed after the twelve year period if they can again win Senate confirmation.<br /><br />This is a very important and much needed book.  I would encourage everyone to read it and encourage their members of Congress to read it and adopt the solutions provided.mportant and much needed book.

Due to lessons learned in WWII (and that have certainly been magnified in recent years), he corrected that notion for readers of this book.<br /><br />The section on defensive unarmed combat is excellent and timeless.  The methods of 'dirty fighting' are basic to one who is in a life and death struggle.  He addresses weaknesses of human anatomy and how to exploit them and has a number of great techniques for self defense.<br /><br />The section on point shooting is also very good for those who carry a handgun for protection.  He does a great job of highlighting the weaknesses of target type shooting for handgun training for self defense/combat situations.  He has a solid section on point shooting.<br /><br />There are large parts of the book that are dedicated to subjects that are not very applicable to readers who are not military or law enforcement types such as mob control, chemical munitions, and raiding techniques.<br /><br />There are also parts that are quite outdated on subjects like body armor, specific weapons, holsters, etc.<br /><br />In spite of all that, the sections on close combat are worth the price and could be valuable for anyone who finds himself/herself in an ugly situation with a criminal, etc.	2005-04-02

Unfortunately, it was much less than it could have been.<br /><br />The story itself was quite well done. It had several funny parts and lots of insights into family dynamics.<br /><br />On the negative side, the details seemed a bit too close to Schaeffer's own personal history. It made it seem more autobiographical. If that was the case as it appears to have been, it seemed to be filled with cheap shots taken at the expense of his family and his deceased father, in particular.<br /><br />This really came across as mean spiritedness by a son who seems to have some deep seated resentments against his father and is attacking him now that dad isn't alive and thus can't defend himself.<br /><br />Due to the approach that he took in this book, I will certainly be passing on the other volumes in this trilogy. I also wouldn't recommend Portofino.	2005-03-31

Unfortunately, I decided to read it anyway since I had liked some of Iles' previous work.<br /><br />The story line is ridiculous.  It involved the long dead ex-girlfriend (Mallory) of the main character (John Waters) who has come back and begun possessing the bodies of people near to Waters.  Her intention is apparently to rekindle the former relationship through the bodies of others.<br /><br />It doesn't stop there with the implausibility.  At one point in the book, the DNA of one character is altered by having been possessed briefly by Mallory.<br /><br />If I were going to classify this book, it would probably be as a bizarre science fiction novel that is not well done.  The ending, in particular, was very anticlimactic.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.  If one is into Stephen King type stuff, he/she might find it to be okay.  For anyone else, I would recommend skipping it.	2005-03-20

Unfortunately, the good information is interlaced with the author's political biases.<br /><br />On the plus side, Stout paints a chillingly accurate picture of what sociopaths are like.  As many people don't expect nice looking, 'charming' people to be dangerous, she puts that myth to rest.  It is a truism that those with no conscience look just like anyone else for the most part and she points out that an engaging personality is often associated with sociopaths.  One shouldn't necessarily feel safe just because a person doesn't resemble Charles Manson.<br /><br />She accurately points out that lots of the sociopaths in society are not in prison as any keen observer of politicians and used car sales people is well aware.  Another thing that she does well is making it clear that most of those with no conscience are not serial killers or other violent criminals.  She even has some case studies included that show some who merely enjoy making other people miserable in lower level ways and some who are just leeches.<br /><br />On the other hand, Stout makes some ludicrous and clearly biased claims.  For example, she asserts that sociopaths make fearless and superior warriors, snipers, and special operations soldiers.  Of course, she does not provide any evidence for what is really an outrageous and ridiculous claim.  Anyone who is familiar with the modus operandi of special operations troops know that they don't just run around killing people.  She should really learn about how the military operates before making such ignorant assertions.<br /><br />Stout also displays her obvious bias in an attack on the evils the pharmaceutical industry in particular and western civilization in general.<br /><br />There is a very good section entitled:  `Thirteen Rules for Dealing with Sociopaths in Everyday Life.\\"  It contains several things that are valuable advice for dealing with those who may be destructive.<br /><br />Overall, this is fairly informative.

Anyone who has ever played without an agreement on what constitutes the acceptable words knows that there are far too many dictionaries out there to easily agree upon one without an official one such as this.<br /><br />That being said, it is not a dictionary that one can use to get definitions of words.  Many times it will only define one usage of a word even when there are others as its purpose is to define what is acceptable in Scrabble play.<br /><br />It is invaluable in terms of listing words that a regular Scrabble player needs to know such as two letter words, 'Q' words that don't require a 'U', etc.<br /><br />One who is a frequent player will probably want to supplement this by getting a list of two letter words from the National Scrabble Association.  That is definitely a good idea as it would be very difficult to be a very competent player without knowing all of those.<br /><br />This dictionary does list countless words that a player may need in different situations such as qat, suq, zyzzyva, etc.<br /><br />It certainly does need to be updated.

Dealing with the threats of terrorism and rogue dictatorships.<br /><br />2. The increasing trend to secularize our nation's traditions and characteristics that make it such a unique civilization, including the rewriting of history to purge God and His influence in our founding and development as a free society.<br /><br />3. That our economic supremacy will give way to other economic powers such as India and China due to the substandard job that our education system is doing, particularly in the areas of science and mathematics.<br /><br />4. That the changing population demographics will collapse governmental programs such as Social Security and Medicare in coming years, and thus create a major economic crisis.<br /><br />In this book, Mr. Gingrich outlines many issues in the areas mentioned above, as well as numerous others.  He also provides very innovative solutions to all kinds of problems.  He is very frank in his assessments and points out weaknesses in policies drafted by Republicans (such as the errors of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq) as well the Democrats.<br /><br />As a former House Speaker and longtime congressman, his knowledge of the workings of government is encyclopedic.  As an historian, he is able to tie many current problems and possible solutions to previous events and put them into context.<br /><br />Some of his solutions are so creative, that I haven't heard anything similar to them before.  For instance, when he addresses the huge problems that we have in math and science performance at both the Junior High/High School and higher education levels, he makes a great case for problems that our underperformance in those areas may cause in the areas of economic and military superiority.  He then advances such ideas as paying students for achieving outstanding performance in those areas.  He also suggests such things as reducing student loan interest rates for those pursuing higher degrees in math/science.  It can certainly be debated whether those are good ideas or not, but clearly they are incredibly creative and worthy of discussion.<br /><br />In the area of Social Security, he clearly outlines what a flawed system we currently have and how, at best, it helps to create a subsistence level of survival for people.  He then educates people thoroughly on the need for private accounts to avoid that in the future.<br /><br />This book covers so many areas that I cannot begin to do more than give the reader a small taste of its contents.  He addresses issues such as immigration (including the problem of having too restrictive of visa requirements for some foreign students particularly those in the math/science areas and what we gain from having them here),  environmental protection balanced with economic growth, election integrity, McCain/Feingold, etc.  I could go on and on with areas he covers.<br /><br />In some areas, I thoroughly disagree.  For instance, he suggests federal standards in the area of education.  According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, the federal government is not given authority in the area of education.  Therefore, that should be left to the states or local governments.  I think a better solution would be to abolish the U.S. Dept. of Education and get the federal government out of the education business entirely.  In a few areas such as this, he seems to disregard what is a proper role for government, but overall, his ideas and solutions are excellent.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is an extremely important work by a visionary that should be read by all policy makers andanyone who is concerned about the vital issues of our day.  If our elected representatives had the courage to implement his ideas (which 99% of them do not), they would go a long way toward solving many of the problems that we face today.yone who is concerned about the vital issues of our day.

Liberals will likely not enjoy it too much as her criticisms are uncompromising and well researched.<br /><br />Although written about serious topics of public policy, it also has a lot of humor and great quotes.  Even some of the chapter titles are funny.  A few examples are:  Elian Gonzales - The Only Immigrant Liberals Ever Wanted to Deport; The Only Cop the New York Times Likes is the One in the Village People; and Give Us Twenty-Two Minutes, We'll Give Up the Country.<br /><br />In a piece on the Elian Gonzales situation, she wrote:  `Liberals lost 300 million people when their beloved Soviet Union was defeated by Ronald Reagan, but Elian gave them a chance to grab one back'.<br /><br />While addressing double standards in reporting, she contrasted remarks made by two sitting US Senators about two of their colleagues and the vastly different treatment they received.  She compared the case of then Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott with that of Sen. Christopher Dodd.  Lott simply complimented Strom Thurmond on his 100th birthday with a statement that didn't appear to have any racist undertones, whereas Dodd made an expressly racist comment in complimenting Sen. Robert Byrd, who is a former recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan.  Dodd said that Byrd `would have been right during the great conflict of the Civil War in this Nation'.  Yet, the media made little mention of it while hounding Lott out of his leadership position for a much tamer remark that didn't even appear to deal with race.<br /><br />It is not just Democrats that Coulter blasts.

Approximately twelve minutes later, it exploded in mid air just off of Long Island.  Reports have indicated that at least 270 people supposedly witnessed objects streaking toward the aircraft.  FAA radar operators in New York also witnessed an unknown object `merging' with the aircraft just prior to the crash.  After an extensive investigation the government concluded that it was the result of a mechanical failure.<br /><br />Demille's story features an FBI agent, Kate Mayfield, who is not satisfied with the official outcome.  Five years after the crash she attends an annual memorial service for the victims of Flight 800 with her husband, John Corey.  He is a former NYPD detective and currently working as a contract agent on the same anti terrorist task force as his wife.<br /><br />Mayfield mentions some of her concerns to Corey.  Then, while they are at the memorial service, another FBI agent Liam Griffith warns Corey off.  This threat gets Corey very interested in the case and he starts looking into it.<br /><br />During the course of the story, intense pressure is put on Corey to cease his extra curricular efforts.  In spite of all of it, he doggedly pursues the case.<br /><br />In the latter part of the book, the action gets very intense.  It develops into a story that is hard to put down.  I thought that the ending was pretty weak,  however, the overall story is exciting and fast paced.<br /><br />I would recommend it.	2005-02-07
US	50021673	RO04VTERIRJ88	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Entertaining and Informative	State of Fear by Michael Crichton is entertaining fiction with lots of factual meat.<br /><br />The basic story is about a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by the small island nation of Vanutu over global warming.  The contention is that the island was in jeopardy of being wiped out by rising sea levels due to global warming.<br /><br />Although the novel is fast paced and well written, the best part of the book is the way that it entwines tons of scientific fact in the story.  It even contains numerous footnotes and an extensive bibliography.<br /><br />It is fiction that should be read even by those who normally limit their reading to non-fiction.<br /><br />Crichton contends that the PLM (Politico-Legal-Media) complex (which replaced the old military-industrial complex) flourishes by promoting an ongoing state of fear in the population.  He asserts that the PLM has used environmental and other crises to serve their own ends.  The politicians use the fear to control the population, the lawyers need the perceived dangers to sue and make money, and the media exploits the same stories to keep readers buying papers and viewers tuned into TV news.<br /><br />He also takes on university professors whom he says no longer teach, but leave it to the graduate students who know much less and `speak English poorly'.  He outlines how universities have transformed themselves from `bastions of intellectual freedom' to the `most restrictive environments in modern society', and that they are the creators of the new fears that the PLM promotes.  He contends that universities now are not liberal at all, but are `fascist to the core'.<br /><br />Speaking of the effect of the PLM fear mongering, he reminds the readers that the industrialized nations provide their citizens with `unprecedented safety, health, and comfort' and that the average life span has increased by 50% in the last century.  In spite of this, he says `modern people live in abject fear'.<br /><br />Crichton does an outstanding job of exposing numerous fears manufactured by the PLM including global warming, the contrived DDT crisis, rising sea levels, expanding deserts, melting glaciers, increased numbers of weather catastrophes, silicon breast implants, cancer from power lines, etc.<br /><br />The book is a gold mine of information complete with references to back up his claims.  Those who have closed minds and blindly believe in all of the contrived crises will not like this book.  Those who are open minded and interested in the other side of the story will love it.fear'.   <br /> <br />Crichton does an outstanding job of exposing numerous fears manufactured by the PLM including global warming, the contrived DDT crisis, rising sea levels, expanding deserts, melting glaciers, increased numbers of weather catastrophes, silicon breast implants, cancer from power lines, etc. <br /> <br />The book is a gold mine of information complete with references to back up his claims.
