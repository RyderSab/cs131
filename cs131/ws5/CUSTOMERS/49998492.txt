I found the book to be very formulated and almost a soap opera story line.<br />The story line was weak and predictable. My favorite part of the book was the Snoop Sisters. I did not have the feeling in the last 100 pages that there was no way the story could wrap up w/in that page timing and the urge to shut out my household so I could finish. I did find myself hunting through my bookshelves wondering what I could read next that would blow me away. I dreaded having to finish this book because I felt it was taking my time away from a better read.<br />On the flip side I did learn a lot about Orthodox Jews.<br />I am curious about here early works; being that this is the second book she's written alone. I'm in no rush.	2004-06-29

SLEEPING BEAUTY did not let me down. It grabbed me from page 1 and kept me going. I read this book w/in 5 days and I have 2 very active children (6 &amp; 2) This book is reminiscent of Tami Hoag's writing style. Faced paced. Entertaining. A must read for a true mystery reader.<br />This was my 1st Philip Margolin book. I'll be back for more.	2004-06-26

Issues w/the 4th grade teacher. The ice machine. Hotel. Cabbies and so much more.

I didn't know what to expect going into this book but once I started I couldn't put it down. I was astonished at Bev's behavior and they way she treated her son as well as herself. There were even many moments when I wanted to reach into the book and shake her silly. In the end I applauded her for who she became and what she overcame.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has a teenager that thinks they know it all and there are very little consequences to having sex, doing drugs and thinking school is unimportant.<br />I know my children will be reading this book on day w/my encouragement.	2001-11-20

I know that there are many different versions but I was slightly disappointed that the ending was different from the version I remembered as a child. In this version Rumpelstiltskin flies off on a spoon. The version from my childhood is where Rumpelstiltskin is so mad that he jumps so hard he goes through the floor.

I have never been a huge fan of Athurian legends but when I saw this book I had to try it. You get to see the world through Guenevere's eyes and what a great new perspective.<br />Remember 1 thing Athurian legends all have a slightly different point of view and this is Guenevere's angle. Because of this book I have started my own quest for other versions of this legend.<br />The first half of the book was slow moving. It was loaded w/facts and backgound that you were familiar w/but w/a new angle. Once you hit the halfway hump the book flew by. You were swirling w/new facts and great scenary. You felt Guenevere's pain and saw Arthur's breakdowns. There were surprises around every corner and passion w/every touch &amp; kiss. The passion between Lancelot and Guenevere is breathtaking and the tension will bring tears to your eyes.<br />The end of the book was slightly disappointing. It seemed that she went opps! I have to bring you back for 2 other books and we haven't heard about these other characters in awhile. So here they are and come pack for more. It worked I'll be back for more and I learned a lot about Guenevere and gained more respect for her.<br />Read this book.	2001-07-22

It was interesting to see the two cultures join for a common cause and to see the different veiws. The 1st half of the book moved slowly for me because I was absorbing a lot of information and was the judge and the jury at that point. The 2nd half moved along a lot faster but didn't hold my attention very well during the trial, sort of a been there done that situation until there was a twist. I was also getting very annoyed w/Katie I'm mean GEEZ snap out of it girl. I was disappointed w/the last chapter. It seemed like it came right out of Scott Turrow's 'Presumed Innocent' movie.  All in all it was a good read I read in w/in a week. It needed an epilog to say this and this occured w/in a year or so or even a ten year look back to see where everyone was.

It's not my favorite book of all times but it did strike up my curiosity and make me think.<br />Being a Catholic I could see all the points being made and understand a lot of why Mary did what she did growing up and going to the convent and her choices for leaving. Also, somewhat like Mary I wanted a child at any lengths and if I were to never get married I would've done exactly what she did. In the 1990's it just wasn't as much of a scandel as the 1950's. It also brought up a lot of valid challenges against the Catholic church as well as pointing out that things aren't much different with time. The Catholic church is still the same although women are some what of a more active now.<br />If you are looking for something that questions faith and argues for and against it this is the book to pick up. Even though I wasn't overly pleased with the book I did get caught up in it BUT in the same sense I wanted it to end.	2001-05-02
