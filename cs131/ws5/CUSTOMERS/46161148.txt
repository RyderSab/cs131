This isolation in a diverse environment has led them to evolve to fill a myriad of ecological niches. They are also one of the most popular groups of aquarium fishes and their behavior and diversity is of interest to a large number of people.  That is why this book, a scientific treatment of their behavior can be produced for a larger audience.  As such this is perhaps the best book, available to the lay reader, on fish behavior.<br />George Barlow is (was) a fish behaviorist at UC Berkeley.  In this volume he explains the complex behaviors of mate selection, territoriality, feeding, and the rearing of offspring in this well studied group.  He also discusses their diversity and, sadly, has to address their conservation (as the their home is being lost to several environmental factors).  This book is interesting and well written. However, it is  probably only of interest to the most serious cichlid hobbyist, or persons with a special interest in fish behavior in general.	2003-12-08

When I brought this book home the wife asked \\"why do you need another fish book?\\" I will tell you like I told her.<br />This is the best book I have seen on the fishes commonly found in the aquarium industry.  The fishes are arranged according to systematic (evolutionary) relationships, so it is in a format that is familiar to me, and more useful to people that are not already familiar with fish groups.  Organization, however, is a minor part of a book.  But the information in this book is also top notch.  There is important information on hundreds of species referencing, feeding, care, availability and compatibility that is important when considering an addition to your salt water aquarium.  There are also excellent sections on general aquarium keeping and reef inverts.  This makes this a must have for any hobbyist.  Lastly this is also a VERY attractive book, it now gets to be in the living room (near the aquarium where it should be) instead of in my library.<br />I didn't use those exact words with the wife, but you get the picture.  If you're looking for a book on salt water aquarium fishes this is a great choice.  Hopefully amazon will begin carrying it soon.	2003-12-08

The Origin of Species is most definitely the most important work in the field of biology, as it is the most succinct and well developed explanations of the unifying principle of the field, evolution via descent with modification.  I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining the theory or why a person should study it.  I want to explain who should read this book and why.  If you are looking for an introductory text on the theory of evolution you need to stay well away.  There are other better books.  In many cases Darwin's examples and arguments are outmoded or have been changed.  The book overlooks many aspects that are included in modern evolutionary theory, such as genetics, simply because Darwin did not know about them.  Natural selection as Darwin wrote it is one of the most effective explanatory theories in all of science but by reading this book you miss almost 150 years of the things it has explained.  It is also a flat out PAIN to read, they where much \\"wordier\\" in the 1800's and Darwin's English is rather stilted and formal, even compared to modern scientific writing.  So, who should read this book?  Any person who is an advanced student in biology (I read it the summer before my senior year) should be aware of how the modern theory of evolution was born.  You can't really achieve this without reading Origins.  I am aware of no better way of understanding evolution that to follow its development through time, beginning with Darwin.  And, if you don't understand evolution, you don't understand biology.  As something to read it is a classic, arguably the most influential work of all time.<br />A note on edition: this copy is the one I have.  I would suggest the facsimile of the First Edition found elsewhere on Amazon.  I don't know why the publishers felt the need to put the caricatured  human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover.t the need to put the caricatured  human evolution (addressed nowhere in the book) on the cover.	2003-10-29

I have to say that the Castro and Huber have taken a professional, effective approach to covering a diverse subject.  The book takes a typical approach.  Part 1: The nature of science and the physical environment.  Part 2: Life in the marine environment, starting with physiology and moving on to diversity.  Part 3: Ecology, covering basic principles and exploring various arine habitats.  Part 4: Man's impact on the sea.  Things that I like about this book include: the excellent illustrations, both photographs and diagrams; box readings on special topics; and the chapter self reviews.  Things that I do not like include the failure to put the various groups of animals in evolutionary relationships.  There are two chapters on marine organisms, vertebrates and invertebrate.  This arrangement fails to recognize the over all diversity of these groups and frequently unrelated groups are piled together for no reason but convenience.  I think perhaps a simple appendix of cladograms of the various groups would address this.  There is also a companion web site that I have not had the time to explore.<br />In all, it is an effective introduction to marine biology.  I am enjoying incorporating it in to my class.  I also think that it would be a fine choice for persons who want to study marine biology on there own.  It is written at such a level that a person with a high school education can understand it with only a few references to the glossary or other books.	2003-10-29

With this work he has brought the evolution of the fishes to the popular science reader.  My only major complaint about this book is in format.  I would like to have seen it arranged by geological period as apposed to taxonomic group.  I also think that a more visual group of cladograms arranging all the fishes would have been in order.  Many cladograms are included but they only show small snippets of the relationships between fishes and you have to piece a larger picture together throughout the book.  The illustrations are excellent and you will have a hard time finding so many images of fossil fish, if you are just interested in seeing images of fossils then this will be great for you.  I also liked how he discussed the development of major morphological features. While a person of specialized interest might be aware of these, having them all in one place is convenient.<br />If you have a developing interest in fishes or in vertebrate paleontology than this book would be good to have.  It would also be a nice compliment to any library including material on natural history.	2002-10-06

First, as a photo essay of the biota of the Indonesian islands it must be beyond compare.  The photos are simply awesome, leaf through it and see for yourself.  Second, it tells the story of one of the worlds least known but greatest scientists, Alfred Wallace.  Wallace was just as responsible for developing the theory of evolution through natural selection as Charles Darwin.  If you are interested in the history of science or a biology student at any level you should be aware of Wallace's work.  This is as good a book to learn about it as any.  One slight complaint, in reading this book I felt that the authors felt that Wallace received a raw deal from Darwin and the rest of the scientific community.  I don't know if it's true or if the truth will ever be known.  I know that Wallace didn't feel that way so why include it here?  Third, this book is so much a trip through time.  Each chapter on Wallace in the islands is mixed with modern essays on life in the islands and what is happening to the environment there.  As an environmentalist \\"call to arms\\" it is great, because it is backed by better science through a broader range of disciplines than any I have seen.<br />I'm not a big fan of the \\"Coffee Table Book\\" but this is an exception.  While it might be tempting to only look at the pictures, the text is in such a interesting format that reading it turns out to be such a breeze that you will be done before you notice.	2002-10-06

His previous work shows that Richard Ellis is certainly a man of artistic talent with a broad interest in all things aquatic.  With Encyclopedia of the Sea he has tried to bring together as much information as he can about the ocean.  Everyone should know that this can't be done in one book, especially of this size.  I don't think that this was a serious attempt to produce the master treatise on the ocean.  If that is what your looking for look elsewhere (it doesn't exist but good luck).<br />However, this book is good! Hard to put down even.  I have curled up with it a few times randomly going from page to page appreciating the entries chosen and, as always, Ellis' illustrations.  You can go from a description of a pirate vessel to a definition of a group of fishes.  This book might have the most eclectic batch of information ever gathered in one binding.  It should truly be a joy to any person who has a bit of the romantic in their own quest for information.  Get it because you want it, not because you need an encyclopedia on the ocean.	2002-08-20

It will be indispensable if you study fishes in any Mississippi river or Gulf drainage.  I can remember my first day in class, thinking that we where just going to look at a bunch of minnows.

Books	1	32	62	N	N	Hypocrisy, especially intentional, upsets me	Wells tries to throw doubt on 130 years of the scientific study of evolution in a single, somewhat short text without any original research of his own. The author describes what he defines as \\"Icons of Evolution.\\" He describes these several concepts and logic chains that are frequently used in the argument for evolution through natural selection. He points out fallacies in the research that led to them. What he either fails to realize or fails to explain is that most are only examples of facts supporting evolution, a few samples among hundreds. The \\"Finch's Beak\\" for example, this is very straight forward divergent evolution. Hundreds (thousands) of examples of species arising through divergent evolution are available for study every day. In the peppered moth study, Wells points out that the moths where purposely photographed on contrasting trees to show their camouflage effectiveness. What about the fact that the ratio of white vs peppered moths did change? Haecklel's drawings? in most textbooks we now have actual photographs that show pretty much the same thing Dr. Wells.<br />I feel that my review has went beyond a recommendation or admonition of Wells' book and more of a direct attack. What upsets me about the book is that he tries to disprove previous research, in his attempt he uses the same tactic that he is accusing others of. I challenge you to read this book but if you use it form your opinions on natural selection you will be cheating yourself in the same way that Wells suggests that society has been cheated by evolutionary biologists.	2002-03-07

I was thinking that it would be about things frequently seen from the beach but it includes a lot of info the layman will probably never need. This includes info (I personally appreciated) about planktonic animals, mieofauna and epifauna, in general a bunch of small animals most people will never notice. Not to say that they shouldn't have been included! They are very important to understanding the ecology of the areas discussed. See what I mean about mixed emotions? I like the way that the book grouped things by community; oyster reef, seagrass bed, mud bottom, etc. A hearty appendix that linked things by taxonomic group would have been nice though. Illustrations where copious but a tad bit simple. In the price range the line drawings could have been better, or supplemented by black and white illustrations. Also curious was the listing of only invertebrates until the end, then the authors jumped over everything and threw in a chapter on sea turtles??? What about the rest of the marine vertebrates? Why include the turtles without the fish and marine mammals? Kind of lopsided.<br />If you see this book lying around it is certainly worth having.

With about 1800 terms, many of them cross referenced, I have only failed to find what I was looking for a couple of times.  There are generous illustrations, and I don't think it could have been more visual given the size.

The photography and illustrations are beautiful and informative.  The write ups on individual species, while not all inclusive to any particular group or geographic area are great.  They cover some little known but fascinating animals.  My only complaint is that it's a little TO visual, it tends to rely on the graphic to make points over the text and is a little short on newer science.

He has produced a very eclectic bibliography on life in the sea.  I understand that he began his career as an artist and all of his books are beautifully illustrated.  This one in particular makes liberal use of scratchboard art which does a fine job of bringing the creatures of the abyss to life.  The first section deals with the history of deep ocean exploration.  I found it particularly interesting.  Proceeding sections deal with the myriad of ocean geology and biology topics.  Ellis' treatment of these subjects is effective, particularly for the person with interest but a less than advanced background in science.  I don't think you will find all the information here in another single source.  Ellis, if not a marine scientist, shows a mastery of research and bringing his topic together.  Some of the information is a bit disjointed but all in all a very good read.	2001-10-29

Then there is a dichotomous key to family and to species for all species covered.  The write up on each species has a line drawing in profile and of the teeth. Aside from ID information there is a plethora of useful biological info that is hard to find in any one source for all species.

While anybody who has tried is no doubt familiar with the several very good invertebrate zoology textbooks available this is the only book on the subject that can be appreciated by the mass market.<br />The book groups animals by the traditional phyla, and gives critical information on each.  Characteristics, development, ecology and diversity are all included.  There are many good black and white photographs and a few good line drawings.  If I had one complaint about this book it would be unity.  I would like to have seen each chapter organized along a set pattern.  This would be no easy feat either.

You have to do that in a movie with only 2 hours or so to develop the primaries, its good to see that Benchley managed to avoid it in the book.  Jaws, the book, is about the way people act under stress.  Each person, Chief Brody, his wife, Hooper, Quint and the Mayor all are driven by original motivations with regard to the terror that has beset Amity.  Reading that is what is great about the book.  Not that the shark isn't there!  Benchley manages to write about the giant fish in a way that will grab you from page one.<br />An interesting aside.  Benchley was very sorry he wrote this book, or at least the repercussions it and the movie  had on the public perception of sharks.  He has spent the past few years being a spokesperson for conservation of these amazing animals.	2001-10-28

There is not a character in this book I can find believable.  The main character is supposedly a washed out deep sea scientist with every conceivable problem in the world in an overdone effort to make us feel sorry for him.  Right down to his wife sleeping with his best friend!  The menace is a 60 foot long shark that the author has tried to sell as plausible... Jurassic Park had more believable biology.  I won't start to bore you with the facts but suffice it to say that it is ridiculous.  Then the end?  I won't even try and ruin it for you but it had me laughing with the thought!  If you want a more realistic, scary fish story get \\"One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish\\" by Dr. Zeus.	2001-10-26

Tourist town terrorized by gigantic man eating shark!  Local hero and fisherman rush to save the day.  I had just read MEG (another stinker check my review) and since this was actually set in my hometown I had to read this.  Partly in hopes of seeing my home town well portrayed and partly in hopes of convincing me that the good marine biology thriller was possible.  Wilson's shark is slightly more plausible than Alten's.  At least it doesn't glow in the dark!  All the action sequences are so rooted in unrealism that they just can't be scary.  I'm thinking, giant shark thrashing around in a 6 foot deep freshwater river?  Shark outrunning speedboat?  Come on guys, some one has to be able to write about scary marine life.	2001-10-26
US	46161148	R1FICWVG77WVVK	1559636785	236717307	The Living Ocean: Understanding and Protecting Marine Biodiversity	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Not an easy read or pretty picture book	There are many pretty books which do a good job cataloging threats to our ocean environment. If you want a brief, graphic outline effective at stirring your emotion and imagination stay away from this book. If you want in depth and have the time... check this out.<br />Boyce Thorne-0Miller took a interesting approach to a difficult assignment. She sets out to catalogue man's negative impacts of the sea and threats to oceanic biodiversity. She begins by outlining the definitions and necessity of biodiversity. Then chapter by chapter, topic by topic gives us the potential for various human-ocean interaction to damage it. She backs up her conclusions well with explanation and statistics and goes to great length to explain her deductive reasoning. This book would only be a bore to a person who doesn't have a serious interest in the subject and a little bit of a biology background. I would use this as a text for an undergraduate course on marine conservation biology. I would also suggest it for people with more than a cursory interest in marine conservation. It is wordy and thought provoking, but it presents information, it does not tell you what to think.	2001-09-13

Why? Because I have good luck with Peterson guides and know that they are concise, well written and all inclusive. So far, as I try to gain some familiarity with the fishes of the west coast before I go I have not been disappointed. I'm sure that this book is to the west coast what the Atlantic guide is to the east and gulf coast. I'll write another review after I finish my trip.	2001-09-13

Again the Audubon Society tries to market one guidebook to all of Canada and the US.  For comparison Audubon's close competitor in the layperson field guide business uses three guides to cover the same area.  Peterson's field guides has one for the Pacific coast, one for the Atlantic and one for freshwater.  That's not even including the mammals!  This guide is so broad as to be useless to the person looking at anything but the most common and conspicuous fishes.  The photographs are often dark and useless, showing only the adult stages of several fishes which makes it difficult to determine what species you might have.  The only plus I can give it as that it arranges fish by shape or other distinctive characteristics, this might be useful to the person unfamiliar with fish families.  I made the mistake of getting it as my first field guide to fishes.  From experience let me say this, get yourself a Peterson's to your local area.  The color plates might be harder to learn to use, but they show a lot more.	2001-08-22

I had appreciated Of Mice and Men and other Steinbeck work in highschool, but was tragically unaware of his interest in marine science. Needless to say I now read this book at least once a year.<br />The Log From the Sea of Cortez starts out as a factual telling of a tail about the crew of a boat, seamen, fishermen and scientists who journey to the little traveled Gulf of California (sea of Cortez). The book does an wonderful job of describing the day to day toil of the journey where they must stop every day and collect large numbers of specimens at each low tide. The work is drudgery but it is offset by the fact that they are doing something new, learning things unknown. Throughout Steinbeck explores the metaphysics of being a scientist and an explorer. The characters, who happen to be real people, are excellent vehicles for this exploration. We feel as if we are there with them and appreciating the things that they are, thinking their thoughts and feeling there pain. The trip on the Western Flyer (the boat) would have been the trip of anyone's lifetime. If you read this book it is almost as if you made it also.	2001-08-20

Moody Jr. Natural History Series)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	For the biologist	This book IS NOT a fun book about the fishes you are going to see while fishing or SCUBA diving. If you want that for this area try Peterson's Field Guide or Dr. Bob Shipp's Guide. It IS the definitive treatise on the systematics and identification of all fish one can find in the described area (Texas, Louisiana and adjacent waters). While I give five stars to this book I would not recommend it to any but the most serious of amateurs (professionals already know about it). Before you open it you need to know what a dichotomous key is and how to use it. The pictures are there for confirmation, not identification. It is laid out with an excellent introduction that explains all of the necessary terminology then jumps into how to identify any fish caught to the family level. After identification of the family it gives a key to that family and a brief (it has to be, there are several hundred fish mentioned) description of each species. That is what a field guide does Within it's scope this is the best one available.	2001-08-17
US	46161148	R1M4QGWCWYK8XW	0394519930	935075642	National Audubon Society Field Guide to Seashore Creatures: North America (National Audubon Society Field Guides (Hardcover))	Books	3	21	23	N	N	OK for the Basics	I think that all of North Americas sea shore critters can not be described in a single book.  Certainly not in a book of this size.  The publishers where quite bold in the scope and as such much information has been left out.  That said let me tell you what is good about this book.  The pictures are GREAT! Much better than looking at technical drawings.  However, they are not better for identification.  The descriptions of animal groups are excellent.  For the person with little biological background this will go a good way toward explaining the complexities of ocean life.  The method of identification, sorting by superficial appearance is handy, again for the inexperienced.  To sum it up, if you want one book to carry during your first summer of beach combing get this one.  If you need a companion for a marine zoology class stay away, unless you already have everything else.	2001-08-17

I don't know what the people at Peterson's Field Guides was thinking!  The topic is far to broad to include in one book, and Kaplan seems to try and make it broader.  He includes coral reefs and things distinctly NOT on the shore as well as including topics already in other field guides.  I do NOT want to belittle Kaplan (whom I enjoy) or Peterson's  (who I think makes the best mass consumption field guides available) but unless you really need it, I would stay away from this book.  It does win points for its illustrations and Kaplans knowledge and writing style.	2001-08-15

Greene's &quot;Marine Science&quot; is far and away the best introductory text on the subject I have encountered.  It is well written and follows a logical, well written progression through a large body of information.  The Units and Chapters are well thought out and each has effective review material.  Review questions are in a variety of formats that reenforce without duplicating critical ideas in the text.  Supplementary essays (sidebars) are well written, timely and enjoyable.  My only conceivable complaint would be the lack of color illustration.  Though given the low price, this is understandable.  I would recomend this book to any one interested in marine science or marine biology.	2001-08-14

If you SCUBA dive, fish, keep saltwater aquariums or are an amature or professional naturalist or marine biologist you should have this book.<br />The Field guide to Atlantic Coast Fishes is an excellent treatise on the diversity of fishes in this area. The multitude of species are discussed in a logical manner with valuable information presented for each. The artwork is superb, with the each fish shown next to similar fish and critical points to identification highlighted. You should own three copies, one for your home, one for your office and one for your boat.	2001-03-10

However Kaplan has succeeded in producing a pocket book explaining the most diverse habitats on earth.  He writes from a broad knowledge base covering many topics important to coral reef watchers or biologists.  Frequently he injects wit and humor into what might have been a dry text.  He manages to hit on most groups of animals and uses many types of illustrations to allow the reader to identify and sort out the great number and types of animals that they will see on any coral reef within the area discussed.<br />I am new to this book but have used quite a few field guides in my day.  Now I can't wait to visit the reefs again, armed with my new education.	2001-03-10

Anyone interested in the study of ecology, evolution or taxonomy could not help to find something useful.  It is arranged as a series off essays, grouped by topic.

What it lacks in scientific information it makes up for in entertainment value and facts more usefull to the SCUBA diver or fisherman.	2001-01-16
