Most of us have rather one-sided views - regardless of whether you favor the death penality or not. <br /> <br />All in all, it is a good book. However, I agree with another reader who suggested that the ending left him feeling rather flat. It seems Grisham could have done more with the final chapter. He kinda leaves you in a funny spot with some unconcluded business.	2004-08-14

It was one of the best I have by Grisham.  <br /> <br />First of all, if you don't enjoy all of the tedious lawyerly stuff (e.g. motions, strategy, filing briefs, courtroom drama, etc.) you probably won't enjoy any of Grisham's book.  <br /> <br />This book is a great journey into the world of class action lawsuits. I had literally no idea how they worked. This book is an incredible journey into that world.

If I was only allowed to keep 10, this book would be one of them! <br />This book is extremely easy to read and follow: there are no typos and the socratic teaching style is fun and entertaining.<br />It covers the subjects of strategic planning and methods of conducting the attack. The method is to carefully disect a number of master games and examine the motives behind the moves. The difference is that this book does so using lots of words! (not endless variations and nonsensical symbols like some other books do). As a result, the reader will actually feel as though they can start understanding how a master formulates a plan during an actual game. <br />This book is probably best suited for players rated between 1200 - 1700 USCF. <br />It would ideally be read after reading a more basic book on chess such as &quot;Logical Chess Move by Move&quot; by Irving Chernev, or &quot;Play Winning Chess&quot; or &quot;Winning Chess Strategies&quot; by Yasser Seirawan.<br />By reading one or two of these other books first, it would assure the maximum learning value by reinforcing and then expanding on what is taught in these other, more elementary texts	2004-02-19

This book is absolutely incredible! <br />I grabbed a copy off of the shelf in a bookstore and stood there skimming it for an hour and a half. It is incredibly interesting material. <br />My only word of caution is that if you are not already a strong player (say 1800 USCF) or above - DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! It will cause disastrous results to your chess. <br />On the other hand, if you are already a strong player with considerable tournament experience, this book will likely catapult you to the next level.<br />This book really focuses on the idea of general principles not always applying. It emphasizes the importance of concrete considerations over general priciples. <br />While I totally agree with the authors point - lower rated players need to be well grounded in the general principles FIRST. <br />Higher rated players are better prepared to determine when the general principle does not apply.<br />The book layout, diagrams, format, binding, etc. etc. is all first rate.	2004-02-16

The format, diagrams, and games are all excellent. <br />This book could be used just for fun (i.e. playing over the games), or for instruction (i.e. especially in a scholastic setting). <br />I once attended a lecture given by Grandmaster Ashley on how to teach scholastic players (i.e. what was most important for rapid improvement). He said the focus should be 1) tactics 2 ) endgames and 3) play over minature games.<br />Playing over minature games can help you (or your students) develop a sort of &quot;feel&quot; for tactics sort of by osmosis.<br />anyway, give this book a try - you wou't be disappointed.	2004-01-22

It covers a wide variety of lessons; endgames, pawn structures, attacking formations, positional evaluation techniques, etc.<br />This is NOT a basic textbook for beginner players. the material in this book is probably most useful for players from around 1500 - 2000 USCF. (The book states 1700-2050).<br />Each lesson is self-contained and can be reviewed in an hour or two. Most of the lessons give a little history regarding a particular player or playing style.<br />I could not disagree more with the reviewer who downgraded the book because of the history lesson - one who is ignorant of history is bound to repeat it. Also, I know for a fact that most Grandmaster players are very familar with chess history- especially the classic games played by the masters of yester year.<br />I wholeheartidly endorse this book - each chapter is almost like a seperate chess lesson given by your \\"tutor\\".	2004-01-20

It contains a number of well annotated games in virtually every sub-variation of the Philidor defense.<br />I played the philidor defense in tournament conditions over a period of about two years at the 1700-1800 USCF level. I found that players of the white pieces were not well equipped to handle the positions over-the-board with clocks ticking. <br />Frequently I was able to equalize (or even much better) fairly early in game.<br />I agree with the comments of the other reviewers in this regard.<br />The philidor may appeal to both stodgy, positional wood-pushers, and very agressive players as well. For example the philidor counter-gambit (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 f5!?) is razor sharp and requires very accurate play (for both sides). <br />For the type of player that thinks Nimzovich was brilliant (a.k.a blockade, restrain, etc. etc.) the Hanham variation would appeal the most. (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nf6, etc.).<br />This is a good book on a very underrated opening. It could be used as a way to develop an very effective (and relatively low maintenance repertoire against 1. e4).	2004-01-12

I was not disappointed - I read and re-read this book 2 or 3 times and my rating improved dramatically.<br />Beginner and intermediate players get overly fascinated by studying openings. unfortunately, they typically have no idea what is going on, or why a certain move is made. Therefore, all the time they spent working on the openings is esentially wasted.<br />One of the very best ways to improve your level of chess play, is to study well annotated master games. This approach exposes you to all phases of the game (opening, middlegame, endgame) and gives you a basis to evaluate positions and form plans.<br />This book is simply one of the best books ever written for players rated up to about 1500 USCF.<br />Chernev wrote sort of a sequel to this book entitled &quot;The most instructive games of chess ever played&quot;. I recommend reading this book as well for further reinforcement of ideas.<br />Buy this book - you will NOT be disappointed!	2004-01-08

(Some of them are very misleading).<br />This book is a fantastic reference book covering virtually any major ending situation that you would likely come accross in actual play. It is NOT a textbook - although it could be used to learn basic endings, there are many better books to fill this gap.<br />This book is probably most useful (as a reference work) for more advanced players (say 1500 - 1600 USCF &amp; up) who have likely already studied other endgame manuals.<br />This book would probably also be useful for a post-mortem (analyzing a game after the fact) to determine where a particular player went astray.<br />It is well organized, good diagrams, good binding, etc. It has also been converted to algebraic notation (which was a drawback to the older editions). <br />Some of the earier reviews were most likely referring to the older editions of the book.<br />Hey, for 25 bucks you would be hard pressed to find anything better!	2003-12-04

However, I never really studied it until recently. I had no idea what a treasure I had right under my nose!<br />The games are outstanding and beautiful. Bronstein's annotations are absolutely excellent. He has just the right mix of prose coupled with variations. Many of the newer works I have studied tend to get carried away with the regurgitation of variations, followed by some sign (such as +/=, =, or whatever).<br />Bronstein's book could almost be considered a middlegame manual. I have been surprised at how many positional ideas and concepts have been brought to life by re-playing these games.<br />I would recommend reading some middlegame books first such as Simple Chess (Stean), My system (Nimzovich), or Logical Chess Move by Move (Chernev). Then this book will be extremely useful and educational.<br />I think that this book is best suited for players with ratings above 1300-1400 (USCF).<br />You will not be disappointed if you buy this book.	2003-09-10

It is a must-read for any serious chess player (meaning any player that aspires to play competitively and/or is interested in raising their rating).<br />This book covers in detail virtually all of the fundamental positional knowledge that a player needs to ultimately become master; outposts, open files, 7th &amp; 8th ranks, isolated pawns, pawn chains, doubled pawns, isolated pawn couple, hanging pawns, weak pawns, bishop-pair, etc. etc.<br />It also contains 50 complete annotated games for study which illustrate the themes of the book.<br />This book is probably best suited for players rated 1400 - 2000 (USCF). If your rating is below 1400, you should focus on tactics and endgames. If it is above 2000, then this book will probably not provide too much new information for you. However, you may want to get it just for the game collection.<br />This book is a landmark in the history of chess literature. <br />A word of warning - this book is excellent, but it is hard work to complete it. It is a book that should be re-read every time you gain another 150 rating points or so. <br />I am on my 5th time to read through the book (approximately 550 rating points change) and I continue to learn new things even now.	2003-08-25

This book is one of my most prized chess books. (I have owned hundreds over the years).<br />It is simply the best one volume openings book ever published.<br />This book is broken down by opening variation, and sub-variation. What is unique is that the book illustrates many of the elementary traps that many of the other books omit. It also very clearly explains the ideas behind each of the openings (much more verbage in this respect than MCO or NCO, for example).<br />It also provides what are called &quot;idea variations&quot;. Roughly put, these are variations that may not actually occur in actual practice, but are what you would play if given the chance. (Normally they are either prevented or avoided due to strategic or tactical problems. Nevertheless, knowing them gives you a much fuller understanding of the aims of the opening.)<br />Finally, at the conclusion of each sub-section, there is typically a small number of complete master level games illustrating the variation being discussed. Many of these are all-time classics. In this way, you get to see immediate application of the ideas without having to dig through other sources to find games featuring the opening you are studying.<br />If you can find a copy of this book anywhere, grab it immediately! It will be a long time before you run accross another one.<br />As to the downsides of this book, there are three significant ones;<BR>1. It is out of print - very difficult to find. Even if you do find one, you may end up paying a lot, or ending up with a book that is in not too good condition.<br />2. It is current up to around 1963. In terms of the Double King Pawn openings this is probably less of a problem than some of the Queen Pawn openings such as King's Indian, Leningrad Dutch, Benoni, etc. or the Sicilian Defense, etc.<br />Some of these openings have undergone some radical new developments since that time period. (For example, don't try out the Sicilian Dragon Defense armed with only the variations covered in this book - you will get hosed quickly!)<br />3. The book is written in the older descriptive notation. For those of us who are over 40, this is probably no big deal. For those younger players, this may put them off as everything written today is in algebraic notation.<br />I heartily recommend this book - I guarantee that you will not be sorry for choosing to add it to your library. I ONLY WISH THAT SOMEONE WOULD UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF UPDATING THIS BOOK INTO ALGEBRAIC NOTATION WITH MORE CURRENT VARIATIONS. NOTHING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS EVEN CLOSE!!	2003-04-29

This book is a reasonable attempt to piece together an opening repertoire that on the one hand is aggressive, but on the other hand does not require 100's of hours of preparation time.<br />I actually used the variations suggested in this book for a period of about 2.5 years in actual tournament play. I had very decent results (I am currently rated around 1800 USCF).<br />The lines selected are fairly forcing and unbalanced. There are a few places where the book is somewhat weak. I noted the same problems as one of the other reveiwers in the section on the pirc/modern defense. (There is a game that leaves you hanging in a terrible position, but seems to imply that you winning - it makes no sense at all. In fact, the side they are trying to convince you to play ends up losing very badly in the actual game.)<br />Other than that, I must say that the authors really have done a decent job of trying to &quot;fit&quot; a repertoire within the parameters ascribed.<br />I would estimate that it only took me around 5-10 hours to play over all of the games and footnotes in the book. I remembered them fairly easily, and went on to win a very respectable number of games.<br />I would recommend the book to players rated between around 1400 to around 1800. I don't feel that there are enough notes for players below around 1400 to really understand why certain moves are made. For players over 1800, much deeper preparation than this book provides would be required.<br />In particular, I have had incredible results with the openings chosen from the black side. They are openings that I would not have even considered playing had I not read this book. (Scandinavian and Chigoran).<br />There are better, there are much worse. This is not a bad addition to your library.	2003-04-29

For example, in the section dealing with the King's Indian Defense (a very popular opening, to be sure) he gives a number of really great illustrative games. <br />However, when discussing the Nimzo-Indian Defense (probably equally as popular), the illustrative games are rather sparse.	2003-03-27

I only wish someone would take on the job of updating it - this one was published in 1992.<br />The book is still excellent for a number of reasons. I recommend that you buy it if you can find a copy - it is currently out of print.<br />As the title suggests, the focus is on the critical or main lines of each major opening system. The physical size of the book makes it very convenient to carry along to a tournament.<br />The depth of the book is less than say, Modern Chess Openings, or Nunn's Chess Openings, but as I said the lines covered are the really critical &quot;must know&quot; variations.<br />Frankly, with the advent of computer databases, this type of &quot;readers digest&quot; approach to the opening variations makes much more sense. This book could be used to really understand the meat of an opening system. Once the particular system of interest is learned by following the main lines, the reader could later do more intensive research using the computer database. <br />In this way the two approaches compliment each other and the reader beneftis from the best of both worlds.<br />I truly believe that this book is quite useful to own, even though it was copyrighted nearly 10 years ago. Many of the main line openings shown are still very playable.<br />An over-the-board tournament competitor could do quite nicely using this as a study guide. A correspondance chess player would be more likely to need the added depth and up-to-date lines of Nunn's Chess Openings.	2002-12-03

I agree with the other reviewers and will try not to just repeat what has already been said above.<br />There are so many things to enjoy about this book- the notes and comments by Tal are magnificent. It is very interesting to get &quot;inside his head&quot; as he discusses not just the moves, but moods and psychology of the players and match.<br />The type font and the diagrams are all first rate. In addition to the 21 games contested during the actual world championship, there are another 23 supplemental games between Tal and Botvinnik included at the end of the book.<br />The notes to the moves are just the right mix of words and analysis. Many modern books go overboard on analysis and skimp on the verbal commentary. This might be fine for players rated 2000 USCF and above (if you don't know what this means - trust me you aren't rated up there!), but for the vast majority of players it just sets the head spinning and provides no useful cues to help evaluate a position.<br />This book has enough analysis to be useful, but backs it up with much verbal commentary explaining the motives behind the magic (er, the moves) by Tal.<br />If you are looking to pluck down $ 20.00 or so for a great chess book, this one should be on your list of candidates!	2002-09-26

There are over 1,110 diagrams sorted by theme; pins, forks, skewers, overloading, back rank weakness, Queen Sacrifices, etc.<br />This is not a primer. Beofre tackling this book you should read an introductory tactics book such as &quot;Winning Chess Tactics&quot; by GM Seirawan.<br />Once you are acquainted with all of the different themes, use this book for further practice. <br />There are enough diagrams to keep you busy for months (even years).<br />The intended audience for this book is most likely players rated between around 1400-2000 USCF.<br />The main beef that some of the other reviewers seem to have is that the book contains most of the same problems as Reinfelds &quot;1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations&quot;. My response is &quot;so what?&quot;. If you are comfortable with descriptive notation then buy that book. But for those folks who either don't know descriptive notation, or who actually prefer solving problems in algebraic notation then this is your book.<br />As far as the occasional error or ambiguity in a few solutions - I'm sorry but I have not seen a tactics book that is completely free of these errors.

Very unique approach to study	This book was very interesting to read. I have been playing, coaching, studying, and talking chess for around 12 years. I ultimately reached a rating plateau of around 1850 USCF. The author of this book was able to go from around 1300 USCF to around 2000 USCF in just a few short years. This is almost unheard of as an adult.<br />What I found particularly interesting (and true) in my own experiences, is that many people (including myself) focus on the wrong things to study. When we ask for help from master players or coaches, their advice is based upon partial, slanted, or backward thinking. Most masters don't remember what it was like to be rated 1300, 1400, or 1700. It was just too long ago.<br />What I have learned in my quest is that tactics are the most important thing to study. Next would follow some fairly basic endgame knowledge such as rook & King & pawn vs. Rook & king, etc. A motivated, reasonably intelligent person could easily achieve a rating level of around 1650 - 1850 with a good solid backing on these skills. <br />Most amateur players spend countless hours learning openings by memory, and wading their way through books on chess strategy.(I know because I have done the same thing!)<br />What does all of this have to do with this book? Everything! These are some of the key points made by the author. The core of the book is based around a very aggressive, specific study method that develops chess vision, tactical ability, and improves pattern recognition.<br />After studying countless other books, and using the methods that so many others attempt to make work - I am convinced that Michaels \\"Seven Circles\\" method is working smarter, not harder!<br />Even if you do not agree with all of this conclusions, you will find this book to very interesting and fast to read.<br />One of the other reviewers was very critical of the amount of time one would need to devote to complete the \\"seven circles\\" program. If he actually read the entire book, he would notice that the author recommends a modified program for folks like us with wives, children, jobs, etc. We cannot spend limitless time studying chess (oh, I wish!). The modified program (which I am currently pursuing) is based upon a smaller number of tactical problems over fewer weeks.<br />I have been on this modified program for a couple of weeks and I have already seen my rating (internet) go up around 100 points.<br />They always say that the proof is in the pudding. All I know is that the author who started out as a 1300 rated adult player, won the World Open U2000 section (and $10,000) just a few short years later using his training method. He ultimately achieved a rating of over 2000 USCF.<br />That's pretty inpressive for anyone. It's extrememly impressive for an adult player!	2002-06-25

This is a chess book that every collector should own as part of their chess library. It is one of the all-time classics. It was published by Dover and runs 436 pages in Descriptive notation. (If this book was ever republished in algebraic notation I would rate it 7 stars!!).<br />It basically contains a sampling of master games from many of the greatest masters of all-time; Anderssen, Morphy, Steinitz, Tarrasch, Lasker, Schlechter, Pillsbury, Maroczy, Marshall, Rubenstein, Spielmann, Nimzowitsch, Vidmar, Tartakower, Capablanca, Bogoljubow, Alekhine, Grunfeld, Euwe, Saemisch, Colle, and Torre.<br />Each chapter focuses on a different master in the order described above. There is a biographical sketch of each master at the beginning of each chapter as well. It focuses on a particular masters achievements and some of the unique ideas and methods that master brought to the game.<br />There are a total of 70 very well annotated games.<br />This book is not only a great games collection, but a virtual textbook on how to play the game. It thoroughly discussed many different opening systems, middle game strategies, and endgame topics. <br />One thing I noticed was how many combinations originating from these games are used in so many tactics books such as 1001 winning chess combinations, or combination challenge. I have used those training books in the past - and now I know that they come from real games and who played them!<br />This book has become very hard to find. My advice is this - if you can find this book in a used book store somewhere, don't hesitate. Grab the book, pay for it and get out of there fast before someone else finds the book. You will not regret buying this book.<br />I rated it &quot;only&quot; 4 stars for a couple of reasons - 1)it is in descriptive notation (this book makes it worthwhile learning DN if you don't already know it) 2)Reti died before all of the chapters could be finished. Some of the later chapters in the book are not as thorough and interesting as the earlier ones. Some of the biographical details are left out.<br />Even with the limitations mentioned above, there are few chess books as fun and instructive. Based upon the level of annotations in this book, players rated between 1,100 - 1,600 USCF would probably benefit the most. Players outside of that rating range would still enjoy playing over the games, but would not gain as much insight from the notes.	2002-03-22

My favorite collection of master games has always been &quot;500 master games of chess&quot; by Tartakower and DuMont. This book has easily replaced that book as my favorite games collection.<br />While &quot;500 master games&quot; is still great- I feel that this is superior for several reasons; 1) it is in algebraic notation 2) the games span a greater time horizon and include a few more modern games 3)the annotations are by world class players 4) the annotations are based upon a more modern understanding of the game, and 5) the &quot;pre-game&quot; commentary describing the players, their syles, and the specific tournament all add to the enjoyment of playing over the games.<br />This instructional, historical, and just plain fun factor of the games is excellent. My hope is that there may eventually be a sequel (volume 2).	2001-06-26

The lessons are relatively short (a typical lesson may run 3-5 pages and contain approximately 3 games). <br />The lessons are supposedly designed for players rated between 1750 and 2050. Although in my opinion, a motivated 1500 player would still be able to gain a great deal by reading this book.<br />The lessons cover openings, strategy, tactics, endings (heavy emphasis on this topic), history, and middlegame plans and analysis. <br />I personally enjoyed the &quot;bite size&quot; nature of the lessons - each lesson could be enjoyed, savored, and pondered over in one sitting. <br />The type font, diagrams, and level of explaination are all excellent. This book has just the right mix of analysis versus verbal descriptions of what is going on in a given position. I get lost in books that are too heavy on long strings of endless variations - this book is not like that at all. It has a good mix of good, plain old english describing the action.<br />A sampling of some of the specific topics are; classic bishop sacrifice on h7, the seven evaluation principles, how to draw a pawn down in a rook ending, how to parry a flank attack, open vs. closed positions, attacking the uncastled king, when the kings have both castled on the same side, when the kings have castled on opposite sides, etc.<br />Most of the lessons start of with a little history regarding a certain player (very interesting) and then follows up with a specific concept illustrated by 2 to 4 games.<br />All in all, this book is a good follow up book after a player has read a couple of more elementary treatises.	2001-05-15

If you can find this out of print book anywhere - grab it immediately!<br />It is a collection of heavily annotated games that Fischer felt contained something special, memorable, or instructive. He even included several losses.<br />Each game starts out with a commentary by Grandmaster Larry Evans, who describes the setting, the players, their moods, standings, etc. prior to the game. <br />This is followed by the complete game scores with detailed notes penned by the Great Bobby himself. There is enough material in this book, coupled with enough variety of openings, that one could nearly create an opening repertoire from reading this book alone. (preferable with some reference to modern sources for potential improvements.).<br />I know for a fact that countless talented players have been inspired by this classic for years. I have heard that an algebraic version was printed a few years back and then discontinued abruptly. (I have only seen the descriptive notation).<br />In any case, this book truly belongs in the library of any serious player.	2001-04-12

As in the earlier work, the games are sorted first by opening variation, and then in chronological order within each variation.<br />In this way, these two books can be used as excellent reference material when one is attempting to learn a new opening. It is highly instructive to quickly review how the masters of the past interpreted your pet line before you plunge into more modern theory. (such as Modern Chess Openings or Nunn's Chess Openings).<br />It is also instructive to note some of the early traps and pitfalls that the masters had to traverse - they did not have the benefit of today; knowing many of these traps in advance. They were blazing new trails and would sometimes trip on one of these pitfalls. It is very instructive to see how these errors were actually punished by the opponent, we don't get to see that side of the picture in most of the modern books.<br />As with all Dover books, this one is a great value for the money. It is currently out of print. If you find one in a used bookstore - grab it and run! (after paying for it, of course).	2001-04-12

Each chapter focuses on a different characteristic structure arising out of each of the major variations ; saemisch, classical, orthodox, yugoslav, panov, four pawns, averback, etc. etc. <br />Each pawn structure is carefully dissected as to where the optimal piece placement is, typical and recurring themes and ideas, and finally any tactical motifs that are regular.<br />Each chapter concludes with a couple of Grandmaster level games illustrating the material covered.<br />At the end of the book ,there is a statistical survey of each variation, it strategic and tactical complexity, and its tournament results in master level play.<br />If you play the KID, or would like to, grab this book wherever you can!!	2001-04-02

This book, along with Chernev's \\"Logical Chess Move by Move\\" is clearly the authors Magnum Opus. <br />The book features 62 chapters (i.e. games) played by the \\"older masters\\" like Tarrasch, Lasker, Capablanca, Rubenstein, Fischer(I know - not that old), Botvinnik, Nimzowitsch, Petrosian, etc. etc. <br />The games are dissected at a level comfortable for club level players. Each game focuses on a theme (i.e outpost, weak square, bishop pair, rook ending, Occupation of 7th rank, isolated pawn, etc.<br />I highly recommend this book (along with the other book mentioned) to anyone rated between 1100 - 1600. I can think of few other titles that will return as much value for the modest time investment to read them!<br />Chernev has an infectious love for the game of chess paralleled by few (if any) chess writers, past or present. He was probably around International Master Playing strength. Each game hammers on one particular positional theme. This book is incredibly instructive.	2001-02-19

The text, diagrams, binding, organization is all first rate. The book covers the center counter defense / portuguese subvariation (i.e. 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. d4 Bg4 !?)<br />This is a razor sharp / highly trappy line that didn't really receive notice until the mid 1990's. It may look a little strange, but let me assure you that it is emminently playable. One of my favorite lines runs 4. f3 Bf5 5. c4 e6 6. dxe6 Nc6 7. exf7+ Kxf7 Black is down two pawns and can no longer castle - and yet white is BUSTED!! (go check out the theory). Black has activated every piece on the board, while white's pieces are all at home.<br />This may seem rather obscure, yet I have played this line countless times. There are many variations in the portuguese that run along similar ideas. <br />In short, this is an excellent book that deals with a very specific opening. <br />If you are below the rating level of 1900 USCF, I would strongly recommend that you give this opening a try. It is guaranteed to throw your oppoent off balance, and it is great fun. Overall, my results have been excellent.	2001-02-01

I tore through the pages as fast as I could read them and my rating went up by 100 points almost immmediately! <br />This book is fantastic - every single move of every game is commented on. The comments are by Irving Chernev. He had a love of the game and its' great masters like few authors I have ever read. He also had a great sense of balance between verbal descriptions of the ideas behind the move, and the possible variations. In other words, his books are heavy on words and a little lighter on variations than many other books.<br />This is the perfect balance for developing players who need more explanation as to what is going on during the game. More advanced players (1700+) will probably not get much instructive value out of the book, but may still enjoy the games.<br />This is definitely a must-have book for players rated 1100 - 1500.	2001-01-24

Irving Chernev is a great author for developing chess players rated between 1000 - 1800 USCF. He has an infectious love of the game, and the ability to write in a way that is very understandable to players below the expert/master level. He typically uses just the right blend of verbal explanation and actual move order variations. (Some books just recite a catalogue of possible variations - this is worthless to developing players).<br />This is an awesome collection of some of the greatest games ever contested on the chess board. The notes are good, and very easy to follow. The large size of the book is a plus - it will lay open next to your chess board, making study very easy.<br />As with all Dover books, the price can not be beat. If this book were to be re-print and re-published today, using algebraic notation, I would imagine that the price would approximately double (like many other books we have seen).<br />If you are looking for some excellent,inexpensive study material, or want a collection of master games for entertainment, this book is a great place to start.<br />P.S. Several years ago, a master at our club (Seattle Chess Club) was being interviewed for a magazine article after winning the Seattle Chess Club Championship. He was asked to name his favorite chess books. This book (under the title then of &quot;The Golden Dozen&quot;) was the first one he named.<br />The Only negative feedback regarding this book would be the fact that it is written in descriptive notation. This may be more of a problem for younger readers, as most of the &quot;over 35&quot; crowd is probably comfortable with either notation. <br />However, due to the incredible value that this book provides I am still awarding it with a full five stars.	2001-01-22

The relatively small, inexpensive, out-of-print book is one of the very best books to start the journey of understanding positional chess.<br />This book clearly, and simply, explains concepts such as weak pawns, weak squares, outposts, minority attacks, space, etc.<br />I have read it three times now, once when I was rated 1300, again at 1500, and now once more at 1800. Each time I read it, I understand a little more than may have escaped me on an earlier read.<br />For me, two of the highlights of the book are; 1) size - this book is probably 5.5 x 8 inches and is easy to tuck in a briefcase or folder, and 2) the outstanding master game examples that the author chooses (which are not games that you see in every other chess strategy book).<br />This book is probably best suited to players who have acheived a rating level of at least 1200-1300, and can easily be enjoyed by players all the way up to around 1900 or so.<br />If you find this little book in a used bookstore somewhere - grab it fast !!	2000-11-29

This book focuses on the Von Henning Schara Gambit against 1. d4 and the Center Counter (Icelandic and Porteguese Gambits) against 1. e4.<br />In general, both of thses lines offer very interesting counter chances for a player of the black pieces willing to invest a pawn to unbalance things. This is very important if you are attempting to play for a win with black, rather than just holding a draw.<br />I am not much of an expert (yet) in the Von Henning Schara, but I done extensive studying and playing the Center Counter (Icelandic Gambit and Porteguese) System featured in the book. I have to take exception with some of the other reviewers, I thought that the book actually seemed rather thorough compared to many of the other books I have read on the subject. <br />What really impressed me was the amount of analysis available on some of the sideline variations leading to the main line. (I have encountered these specific variations quite frequently, both over the board and on the internet). <br />My feeling on repertoire books is that their job is to get you acquated with a system by explaining the key ideas, and then provide a number of illustrative games to see the ideas in action. This book does an okay job of fulfilling that objective.<br />Beyond that, if you want to find some highly obscure line it is time to consult a specialized database and find those games yourself. I don't think that a reasonably priced, normal sized book can provide that level of detail.<br />Overall, this is a pretty decent book. It is probably best suited for players in the rating range of 1300 - 1900 USCF.	2000-11-17

One of the attractive features of this book is that the author actually plays the opening in GM level events and displays a real passion for the opening.<br />The selection of illustrative games cover a wide period including a few early games up to the most modern lines.<br />I found myself &quot;chomping at the bit&quot; to go out and unleash the KG on someone after reading this book. I have had pretty good results and a great deal of enjoyment.<br />The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is that it starts with 1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 - the king's knight gambit. So if you like the bishop's variation on move 3 look somewhere else.<br />The book also covers the declined variation and other offbeat tries such as falkbeer, schallop, nimzovich, etc.<br />All in all a very good book.

The book covers all three  phases of the game - ending (first), middlegame (second), and openings  (last).<br />Tarrasch's writing style is very clear and easy to understand.  The section on the endgame starts with basic mating patterns (most players  could skip this assuming they already have them down) and works into the  the &quot;essential&quot; endgame theory quickly; square of the pawn,  philidor and lucena positions in rook endings, etc.<br />The middlegame  section leans heavily toward tactical ideas rather than strategic, but this  is a good thing because tactics are the most important thing to study for  an improving student. One major difference in his presentation is that some  of the tactical devices are presented as larger ideas, not just mechanical  executions. For example, instead of running through the usual pins, forks,  skewers, etc. Tarrasch works through ideas such as the attack on the f7  square, the attack on the g7 square, the attack with the h-pawn down the  rooks file, etc.<br />The openings sections is excellent, but very dated. He  begins with a nice discussion on time, space, and force. He then follows by  examining most major opening systems and the associated ideaa. The weakness  of this part of the book is that the specific lines are somewhat dated  (improvements have been found since the book was written), and certain  relatively recent systems such as the pirc/modern complex are not even  discussed.<br />Even with the limitations, most of the ideas he expresses  still retain a great deal of relevance.<br />The final part of the book walks  the reader through some very good illustrative games with lots of notes to  expalain what is going on.<br />All in all, this is a really good book.  Another bonus is the incredible price (this is the case with most Dover  Books.<br />The only downside to the book is that it is written in the older  descriptive notation.

It has some intro pages discussing the merits (and demerits) of the opening. This is followed by chapters sorted  by variation. <br />Each variation is illustrated by a number of actual games  with light annotations.<br />The progression of games is interesting - the  author starts out with some of the less critical variations (i.e. the  practical over-the-board responses that a player who is &quot;winging  it&quot; would play) and builds logically to the most testing lines (i.e.  the variation that the stronger player who is prepared will play)<br />The  author claims a 77% kill rate, according to his database. This is a truly  impressive statistic. The author is careful to explain that the high  percentage of white wins includes some games played by club level players,  experts, and a few masters.<br />At the GM level, where defensive play is a  fine art, the results would be far less positive.<br />I have played the  advance French variation for years as white (1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 ? ) as  an attempt to cut down on my study workload as white. The problem is that  quite frankly I have found the resulting positions to be very boring - not  something that I could sink my teeth into. <br />By playing the Alapin French,  1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Be3? ) You save a lot of study time for white by  forcing black to play your chosen game. At the same time, the positions get  very tactical and exciting fast, which will appeal to most players under  the Master level.	2000-08-22

The first portion of the book could be skipped if you are willing to take his ideas on faith alone - I skimmed the first section and concluded that the ideas were reasonably sound.<br />The  second part of the book consists of the actual improvement methods. The  main lessons from the book are that<br />1) most people get stuck at a certain  level after a number of years of playing chess,  2) unless you study  smarter (not harder) or do something drastically different in your routine,  nothing will change,  3) you need to allocate some of your study time to  re-inforce what you already know,  4) you MUST study your own games -  especially losses very critically and honestly.<br />In my opinion, some of  the earlier reviews were unduly harsh regarding the use of computer  technology or flashcards and gave the book an artificially low review. It  is the method and the ideas that are important. It really doesen't matter  so much whether you use hard-copy, computers, flash cards, etc. Just do  what works best for you, BUT DO IT!	2000-07-24

This book is a repertoire book centered around the Leningrad Dutch - a very aggressive (yet slightly risky for both white and black), tactical line. The specific line highlighted is as follows- 1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3.  g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. o-o o-o 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 Qe8.<br />This book has three  features that I really like-<br />1)An intro chapter discussing typical  middlegame plans, tactics, and various pawn structure that are likely to  arise in this variation.<br />2)It covers many other sidelines such as  staunton gambit, english, etc. that one is likely to face in addition to  the main line.<br />3)It has a final chapter with &quot;test&quot; positions  so that you can find out how well you have learned the opening.<br />Warning!  This opening is not for the fainthearted! - If you like an all out slug  fest where both sides &quot;burn their bridges&quot; early, and you enjoy  putting maximum pressure on white's position-then play this opening.  <br />Note: I have had pretty decent results with this opening. I am currently  rated in the 1800-1900 USCF range and I find that many of my opponents are  not terribly versed in dutch lines- they spend thier time preparing against  the Nimzo-Indian, King's Indian, Queen's Gambit, etc. Therefore, an  additional bonus in playing the dutch is that I have generally been more  familiar with what's going on during the game than my opponent.	2000-07-21

First let me say that this is a book for intermediate to advanced chess players. Beginner or novice players should look elsewhere for chess instruction.<br />This book contains many revelations of positional chess as  inititally &quot;discovered&quot; and expounded by the father of  hypermodern chess - Aron Nimzowitsch.<br />This book is easier to read, and  more fun than &quot;My System&quot; or &quot;Chess Praxis&quot; written by  Nimzo himself. <br />It esentially examinines most of the same topics;  prophylaxis, overprotection, restriction, blockade, centralization, doubled  pawns, etc. In addition, the second part of the book contains a huge  collection of games played by Nimzovich throughout his career. They are  reasonably well annotated by Keene with some reflections about how they  might stack up by todays standards.<br />I would probably recommend that you  read &quot;My System&quot; or &quot;Chess Praxis&quot; first and then  tackle this book for re-inforcement. But keep in mind that this book is  easier to wade through than the other two due to a more modern writing  style.<br />The diagrams, binding, text , game collections, interviews, and  notes are all first rate. This is a great book and worthy of study by  anyone wanting to add depth to your game.	2000-07-21

Also I like the style of annotations used throughout this book- a few variations mixed with much commentary. To me this is much more preferable than simply listing a myriad of endless move strings and some symbol with an evaluation. (which is what some other books try to do.)<br />4) Unlike some game collections by other players, Tarrasch includes a fair number of losses to his opponents in which he openly criticizes his own play. He typically goes on to point out the particular lesson he learned from the loss. To me, this makes the book very real, and increases my respect for Tarrasch, both as player and author. <br />By repeated exposure to certain concepts (i.e. open files, weak squares, outposts, pawn minortities, etc.) a student will rapidly incorporate these concepts into his or her play.<br />The only warning here (which has been touched on in the other reviews) is that Tarrasch tended to be rather dogmatic and general rule-based in his play than modern masters. Also, due to the time period in which the games were played, some of the opening variations used may look almost humerous to a modern player.<br />However, even with the caveats mentioned, this remains a most excellent study manual and a good representation of the style of play at the time. It is a safe bet that anyone who bothered to play over a sizeable sampling of games from this book could not help but improve their play.	2000-06-22

Even though this book is out-of-print, do anything you can to find a copy and add it to your collection.<br />This book combines the variations behind the openings (such as Modern Chess Openings), the ideas behind the openings  (such as &quot;The ideas behind the Chess Openings&quot; by Ruebin Fine),  and complete sample master level classic games to illustrate each opening  (such as &quot;500 Master Games&quot; by Tartakower.<br />I only wish that  someone would undertake a modern revision of this book. It would be a major  project, but I would think that it would sell likes hotcakes.<br />There is  simply no better book for initially learning a new opening. Caution: after  digesting the material in this book, one would need to find a more modern  treatise with some of the newer lines to be &quot;tournament ready&quot;.	2000-06-02

It is probably best suited to players rated between 1500 - 1900 USCF who have already studied a beginning primer on the subject.<br />Basically the book  consists of 56 tests, each containing 8 practice problems. Each section  focuses on a particular tactical theme and is timed. You are given a score  based upon the total time used and the number of problems correctly  solved.<br />The author recommends tackling one or two tests per week. (An  average test of 8 problems requires approximately 35 - 55 minutes to  complete).<br />After a large number of tests have been taken you can estimate  your chess rating based upon your test scores. The author provides a  reference table to equate scores to aproximate ratings. (I found the model  fairly accurately reflects my current rating as oppossed to some other  books I have tried).<br />I have been pleased to see my average score slowly,  but steadily improve over the last few months of working on these  tests.<br />Bottom line is this - for most chess players tactics are the most  important element of the game to focus on. You would be hard pressed to  find a book that is better organized than this! <br />I am looking forward to  completing this book very soon so I can go on and tackle the next volume in  the series - &quot;Test your Chess IQ - Master Challenge&quot;.	2000-02-29

This  feature alone makes the book valuable, especially for lower rated players  who will get nothing out of the typical opening monograph with no words and  all symbols.<br />The books limited size means that a higher rated player,  such as 1900+ will definitely have to supplement the book with more  specialized materials in order to be prepared for that exalted level of  opponent.<br />There seem to be few (if any) typos in the book and the  selection of illustrative games are pretty good. <br />The only reason I  subtracted one star was for the lack of depth in certain chapters.	2000-02-10
