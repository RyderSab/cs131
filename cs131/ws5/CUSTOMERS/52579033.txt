Landvik starts with a good idea, a young bride whose sexual appetite and pregnancy scare off her too-handsome husband (whose story isn't resolved until almost the end of the book).  Patty Jane, her sister, Harriet, and her mother in law, Ione, make an interesting combination, focusing on generational interaction and bonding.  The book traverses their lives for about 40 years, mixing joy and adversity. <br /> <br />But, I was hopeful that the characters would come alive, jump off the page and grab me.  But they didn't.  The characters were almost believable but just not real.  They were one dimensional, and lacked depth.  The multigenerational storyline is familiar, the troubles almost predictable.  There were a few plot twists but on the whole, they felt contrived. <br /> <br />The only true wisdom of the book is toward the end where Patty Jane decides to \\"pretend\\" that she can handle all that life has dealt her.  Even though she belives she is \\"pretending,\\"  she exhibits strength and perserverence.  At least, that's what I hope the author has intended. <br /> <br />This is a quick bedtime or beach read, but nothing that will change your life.	2004-10-18

This book brings his orginal Harmonic Convergence technique to any quilter.  His instructions are clear and concise, and he offers many alternatives to the orginal pattern.<br />The first joy of the book are his telling of his own story, including the devastation of a tornado on his home town.  He chronicles his life in music and how that translated to his magnificent quilting.  He brings his Granny alive to the reader, just as he does in classes.  The second joy is the display of full color quilts constructed by his students from across the country.  It was amazing to read the names and home towns because I've met so many of them through Ricky's classes.<br />I have never read a quilting book from cover to cover.... but this one I did... and will again.... I honor him as a friend and mentor!  And wait til you see his DVD's of techniques!	2004-06-07

I first encountered LDS women while working at a summer camp (too many years ago to talk about!), and intuitively felt there was something amiss with the whole LDS system.  Since then, I've known scores of LDS folk... and this book simply confirms all that I've felt about the Mormons and their cultish ways.  It must be stated that I am not christian, mormon, or affiliated with any organized religion.  And I am entralled with the expose of the practices of any elitist group.<br />I recently had a discussion with an LDS woman who sent her eldest daughter on an 18 month mission.  &quot;It will go fast,&quot; she said, &quot;We want her home to get married and start having babies.&quot;  No mention of education or career or financial stability.  Just &quot;start having babies.&quot;  The women I now work with come from traditional and fundementalist LDS groups, and have the highest use rate of antidepressants of any other subgroup.  But they will never admit they feel trapped with their large families and low incomes.  They will never admit their husbands are largely unsupportive.  They will never admit that the ravages of repeated and closely spaced pregnancies are health hazards. They have lost their voices and often, their spirits.<br />Krakauer skillfully weaves the history of mormonism into the story of two brutal murders.  By carefully laying a foundation of history, one can easily see how Lafferty was lead to do what he did.  But more importantly, Krakauer shows how extremism in ANY form can lead to distorted &quot;truths&quot; and how fundementalism can be so dangerous, regardless of the theology.  Religion, rather than spirituality, is a dangerous thing, fostering the &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; mentality that has spawned so many &quot;holy wars&quot; and lead so many astray.  For many, religion absolves them of personal responsibility for actions and beliefs, &quot;god made me do it.&quot; It is a filter of distortion, thru which one sees the whole world as bad or evil since it often doesn't resonate with what one is taught, rather than placing emphasis on what one experiences or feels deep inside.<br />Krakauer's prose is not always easy to read, but the reader is well rewarded for persistence.  The story is gripping and well constructed.  The other reviewers have done an admirable job of describing the story and providing intelligent critique of the story.<br />It is the deeper message that needs to be addressed:  That extreme fundementalism in any form is a dangerous mindset, one that historically, has lead to murder, war, and enormous dissent.	2004-03-28

But &quot;Rainbow&quot; was lagging a bit in both departments.  Beginning in the 40's, the book spans over 40 years of life in small town Missouri... or does it?  Flagg seems to get lost in an overabundance of characters and plot lines.  I wanted to know more about Betty Rae's relationship with her husband's mistress, or how Doc and Dorothy's children really did in the world.  I wanted more of life on the gospel road with the Oatman's, and more about Jimmy and the Blind Songbird.... but alas, all the characters got muddled toward the end, and it felt like Flagg was on a deadline to finish the manuscript and just tied some neat little bows on the plot without real resolution.<br />The audio book was a great way to pass time on the road, but I felt very disappointed at the end... I wanted more and it just wasn't there!	2003-11-01

Plants and flowers have long been the basis for many traditional healing practices.  Many modern medicines have their &quot;roots&quot; in the worlds of herbalism.   And yet, there has been little integration between systems of thought and practice.<br />In this volume, Rhonda Pallas Downey has amassed a body of work that brings a variety of disciplines into balance and perspective.  She skillfully weaves the historic precepts of herbalism, homeopathy, and flower essences, demonstrating a deep knowledge of not only the principals of healing, but the application of precepts to practice.  With a strong background in healing systems, she also skillfully correlates the use of flower essences to the chakra systems, thus demonstrating the web that brings all healing systems into a cohesive whole.<br />Rhonda shares a wealth of personal experiences that illustrate how flower essences are created, shared, and used.  She guides the reader through the exacting process of choosing, gathering, preparing, and using the flower essences.  There is a sacredness of this process which is clearly inspiring and meditative.  The proving process, in which the essences are blindly tested, adds credibility to this healing method.<br />Forty-eight plants, indigenous to North America, are carefully detailed in the Materia Medica section of the book.  Each plant or flower is detailed as to physical characteristics, botanical names, traditional and homeopathic uses, and suggestions for healing uses.  Data from the original provings is provided to assist the reader in a greater understanding of the plant's properties.   Case histories, observations, and affirmations round out each profile. Rhonda's own exquisite photographs accompany the text.<br />This is not a book to read cover to cover, but one to ponder and explore.  Just as Rhonda encourages us to look at healing on a higher level, the book brings additional layers and dimensions to common plants we may see but not really experience.  This is an exceptional work that deserves a place in the body of knowledge of healing.	2003-02-14

Born without arms, she never saw herself as handicapped, but as a &quot;normal armless person.&quot;  She's one amazing woman.  I'm proud to say I've known her for over 20 years and consider her my &quot;surrogate&quot; mom.<br />While I knew much of her story from countless mornings at her kitchen counter, there were certain stories that she chose not to share over the coffee cups.  This book filled in the details for me and made me even more aware of her triumph and spirit.<br />Morton's writing style is often choppy and mostly narrative.  It would have been a stronger story with more quotes from the loved ones in Mary's life, or recollections from Mary herself.  Even with that minor distraction, I really enjoyed reading the story of a woman who never gave up.	2003-01-13

Minik, the Polar Eskimo child, was brought to the US by Robert Peary and essentially placed on display.  The story of his disconnected life is full of pathos and sorrow.  Yet Harper weaves the story with life.<br />Peary's behaviors were simply egotistic and reprehensible.  He treated the Eskimos as his property.  He placed their lives in harms' way by bringing them to a culture and location that assaulted their senses and immune systems.  Minik was the price paid for that deed.<br />I did get bogged down in names from time to time, especially as Harper recounted the financial misdealings of Wallace, who had taken responsibility for Minik.  But overall, the story is entertaining and enlightening.  It speaks to the ethnocentrism of Peary's generation and to the isolation of the Polar Eskimos.  It took me a long time to read and absorb this book but it was rewarding in the end... to see and feel a culture so far away.	2002-08-25

No matter what path we choose, there are those who walk before us as models, examples, mentors.  It is that spirit of sharing that has been captured within these pages.  Margaret Hatcher, well known Arizona educator, long held the dream of facilitating this volume, to give voice to the thoughts and insights of teachers.  She sought to demonstrate the authenticity of the profession, and to honor those men and women who tirelessly share of themselves in the world of the classroom.  Contributors to this work include educators across the spectrum of learning and from these pages they speak their truths about their schools, their students, and their lives.  I am not a teacher, yet I saw myself in many of the poems, and found the poems touched me deeply as I recalled my own teachers and experiences.<br />These poems clearly show the depth of caring that teachers possess, caring for and about their students, peers, and families.  The role of educator transcends the walls of the classroom and embraces the world.  Where would any of us be with our teachers?  These poems made me laugh and cry and appreciate even more those who have shared their knowledge and spirit with me, as a student and as a peer. <br />I wish I could hug each of the contributors and thank them for sharing even more of themselves in these very personal and touching poems.  I wish I could thank all of my teachers over time.  Thank you, Margaret, for bringing this stunning collection of real words from real people to life and reminding us of the sacredness of sharing.	2002-01-01

And I'm so disappointed.... I kept waiting to like these two women and empathsize with their struggles, but I just couldn't!  Good Harbor portrays two lives, intertwined yet very different in scope and purpose.  Kathleen, breast cancer survivor, comes across as whiney and panic stricken, and harbors a secret that she can't let go.  Joyce, romance author, is superficial and unfocused.  Diamant's background as a Hebrew scholar and writer does not shine here as it in did in The Red Tent.... it's almost an afterthought that adds little to the story.<br />Too many unfinished story lines (the rabbi and Kathleen's son, for example), and manufactured twists (saving Joyce from a drug bust) just don't do it for me.  It seems Diamant really struggled to write this one and I struggled to read it.<br />I felt the hot sands and desert breezes of The Red Tent, which was so rich in lyrical prose.  But Good Harbor is all fogged in.	2001-11-30

Bravo!<br />I was privileged to read an advance copy of this most important book.  As a mid-life woman (and health care provider) who has experienced thyroid disease first hand, I am thrilled that FINALLY that book is finally here, validating my experience and that of countless others.  Far too many classically trained physicians choose to ignore the subtle symptoms and (often louder) complaints of thyroid-challenged patients, adding to the frustration that we already feel.<br />Karilee and Rich have de-mystified the complex workings of the thyroid gland and offered a variety of strategies to identify, diagnose, and treat this often-elusive malady.  They offer a clear  path to enhanced quality of life and improved energy levels.  They offer a variety of treatment options, embracing the best of integrative health care.  The reader is constantly encouraged to seek answers on a variety of levels, from standard medical care to stress reduction to energy balancing and improved nutrition.<br />The book is balanced, objective, and encouraging.  The health care information is nicely integrated with case stories that offer hope and guidance.  Many of them bring back memories of my own journey, which included the advice of one misguided (and male) physician who told me I had panic attacks (in spite of three years of abnormal thyroid blood work!) ... and offered Prozac as his only remedy.  It is unfortunate that women's complaints have long been depreciated in the eyes of the medical establishment, and it is only in recent years that we have begun to fight for equal and high quality care.  This book will give us ammunition as we confront that system.  The authors have included a section for health care professionals that supports their theories and advice with medical research.  <br />Thyroid Power offers a true holistic perspective, assessing the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual components of chronic thyroid disease and offering ways to deal with the whole person, not just blood work or sometimes vague symptoms.  For many it will be a light at the end of a long, dark, and frustrating tunnel, and a path to better health.	2001-06-05

Icy is a young orphan, raised by her grandparents, and afflicted with a rare neurologic disorder that causes tics, outbursts, and other strange behavior.  In the 50's, when this story is set, there was little knowledge of this disorder and less tolerance.  And so, the scene is set for poor Icy to be shunned, punished, and ashamed.<br />She is subjected to humiliation of a sadistic teacher, the senseless committment to a mental hospital that yields no detectable good (she is discharged suddenly and with no improvement of her condition), and finally finds god.  Oh come now.  The characters are almost cartoonish, drawn broadly and without depth.  Story lines are left hanging, and the ending is rushed and not at all satisfying. <br />Oprah, next time you pick a book about the downtrodden, find something that makes sense!  Or how bout a good mystery for a change?  I'm tired of reading of defeat with the same wordy but weak philosophies.	2001-05-11

I first heard about Glen and Bessie Hyde from a friend who runs the river each summer.  They are icons and legends of Grand Canyon lore with the unfortunate tale of their tragic honeymoon trip down the river.  Brad Dimock has not only captured the essence of their story, but tells it with empathy and great attention to detail.  The book weaves three stories into one great piece:  the background and travels of Glen and Bessie, the relentless search by Glen's father, and Dimock's own trip down the river in a similar craft.  <br />Each chapter is headed with one of Bessie's poems, incredibly brief and in many ways, prophetic of her untimely disappearance.  These brief glimpses into her mind and heart are timeless and profound.  We come to know Glen and Bessie as complex individuals who ventured into an unknown arena.<br />I had the opportunity to hear Dimock at Northern AZ University the week the book was released... he was mesmerizing as he recounted his impecible research into the story.  In spite of being a self-proclaimed &quot;hermit in training,&quot; he brought the story, in all its versions, into a new and insightful realm.  Bob Emerson, nephew of Glen Hyde, was in the audience, and seemed moved by the stirring tribute that Dimock provided.<br />The world will never know what really happened to Glen and Bessie, but Dimock seems to ask us to let them rest, and honor their memory.  The river holds her own mystique, and this is one legend that can be told and retold as part of her lore.	2001-04-09

I read it ONLY because my clients are asking about it.  Laura Doyle has taken women back by eons with this pseudoscientific drivel.  Doyle has no credentials..... maybe she read The Total Woman (Marabel Morgan) in the 70's -- or found it at a used bookstore.  This book is nothing more than a rehash.<br />Surrender and submission have no place in today's society.  Wives are no longer &quot;property&quot; or beings without rights.  Those who long to retreat to that era open themselves to abuse and control.  The methods suggested here only seem to encourage the notion that women are inferior and need control.  And it fosters subtle manipulation and in the end, continued control.  Relationships need to be interdependent, not passive-aggressive or abusive.  Doyle is living in the past!<br />I wish I could give this book a ZERO rating.  It does not even deserve 1 Star!  It plays on basic insecurities and fears that plague many people.  It fosters the notion that we are &quot;not good enough.&quot;  Why should we support that idea any longer?  We need to teach more self love and nurturance, not outmoded values that have no place in today's world.  Save your money and pass this one by....	2001-01-15

Jenny Cockell not only knew about her &quot;other&quot; family, but invested an immense amount of energy to trace and validate her feelings.  After having seen the American made-for-TV movie about this story, I had to read the book... and I was not disappointed.. in fact, the story gripped me from beginning to end.<br />It is rare to find someone with the degree of passion that Cockell relates, even rarer to find someone willing to go to great lengths to fulfill that passion.  Mothers, especially, will understand her sense of responsibility to the children she &quot;knew&quot; in what she believes was her past life.  The book is honestly written, emotional, and pure.  I would hope she writes more of this journey and the present lives of &quot;her children.&quot;<br />I do believe in reincarnation and psychic phenonomen, and this book strengthened my beliefs as well as providing a delightful and insightful reading experience.	2001-01-01

I waded thru this book, finding the political information much more interesting than the theology.  While it appears to be well researched, the book is often dry history, not giving the reader a good clue as to why Teresa became the legend that she is now.  The Spanish words are often not translated, leaving the reader to guess at their meaning.  And the vast number of Hispanic names grow confusing.<br />However, the life of Teresa is more about her political wheeling and dealing as she gathers benefactors and founds religious institutions across Spain during a most colorful century.  She managed to stay one step ahead of the Inquisition, even with her detractors on her heels.  I am not christian or catholic, so I found the theology a bit difficult, but I do understand the concept of spiritual journey, which she clearly deliniates.<br />All in all, it was a fair read, the story of a brave and opinionated women who was ahead of her time... I would have liked to get into her head more... and her heart, not as a catholic following the &quot;will&quot; of god, but to know what she really wanted to do.  Did she program for her own immortality?  Or did she really feel the hand of god on her mission?  This, alas, is not clear from Medwick's discussion, and, of course, may never be revealed.<br />I am vastly interested in the lives of the &quot;saints&quot; and the political climate that drove their paths, but this book did not add much to my own insight.  I wish Medwick would have made Teresa less plastic and more real!	2000-12-31

I was enraptured by this book from the first page to the last.  Diamant skillfully weaves a tale of women, from triumph to tragedy and back again.  Like &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; this book dares to suggest that women have had (and continue to have) a powerful role in society.  &quot;The Red Tent&quot; brings that heritage to light.. a radiant light.<br />Dinah, the central character, is only given a brief mention in the bible, but here, she shines!  For me, its just another example of how women have been sublimated by a religious society that sought power, land, and money.  I am not a christian, I do not believe that the bible is the end-all and be-all, and I applaud authors who dare to suggest that another view point is possible.<br />Blessings to Ms Diamant for her courage and wisdom.  The prose is delicious, the imagery lush, and the winds of the desert can be felt in our hearts!	2000-09-21

Redfield may never be a Pulizer prize winner for his often confusing prose (especially  in the first book), but his writing is improving rapidly and I was gripped  by this adventure from the first chapter.<br />Redfield's strength is his  ability to share spiritual truths within a story, making it much more  palatable than boring prose.  His main character is a pilgrim, learning  these truths as he goes thru a colorful adventure, sort of a spiritual  science fiction at times.  I find his message resonates deeply within me...  and I'd much rather read it in a story format.<br />I was reading this book  during a life challenge and it helped me focus on the energy I could expand  to resolve the situation.  And it worked.  I was reassured over and over,  and while my adventure didn't take me thru the mountains of Tibet, it  opened new doors of possibility.<br />Redfield has transcended the mundane  once again, splintered barriers, and teaches us new ways to look at  life....	2000-05-14

I first read The Fifth Sacred Thing when it came out in hardback... it was a well loved copy that was passed from midwife to midwife, and we all added our comments on the flyleafs.  Since then I've read and re-read it, gaining  more insights each time.<br />As a former northern Californian, I could easily  visualize the landscapes, and the characters seemed so real that I almost  expected to run into Madrone on my next trip to San Francisco.<br />Starhawk  weaves a wonderful tale, filled with vivid characters.  Its the age old  struggle of good vs evil, but with futuristic twists and turns.  The  challenges of day to day life in a world where resources are wearing thin  may be a chilling prediction of the future.  We all hold the fate of Mother  Earth in our hands, and Starhawk helps us see what the consequences could  be.<br />I was touched by the sense of community displayed and by the  intelligent integration of spirituality in every day life.  Other reviewers  felt that the book was &quot;preachy&quot; -- but I think Starhawk made her  point... gracefully and with empathy and compassion.	2000-05-13

From the first page to the last, this book not only held my interest but my heart.  King weaves a beautiful tale of the memories of a prison  guard who presided over death row inmates in the 1930's.  But the story is  more about the relationships on the &quot;Green Mile&quot; than the  executions.  It is a story of hope, not death, and of the energy that  exists between human souls.<br />King explores the ability of one person to  heal another, and in the end, it is the guard who heals, by writing his  memoirs many years later.<br />The movie, starring Tom Hanks, is especially  faithful to the book, a credit to both author and screen writer.  The  integrity of the story, the humor, pathos, and affirmation of life is  preserved.<br />Both deserve 5 stars!  One to watch, one to read, again and  again.   Bravo!	2000-02-14

It's the best all around relaxation tape I've  ever used.	2000-01-02

I doubt it!<br />And I really wanted to give it NO stars, but this form won't allow that!  How about it, Amazon... perhaps a ZERO rating?<br />I first read this book in the 70's when it was first published.  I thought it was  mindless drivel then, and my opinion has not changed.  Lindsey uses  pseudo-science and emotional speculation to attempt to convince the reader  that Jesus will return.  Of course, in the original version, he speculated  that the great return would be in 1988, and as we all know, that just  didn't happen.  He fails to understand that the bible is historic fiction,  not divine thought, and that christians are actually in the minority when  it comes to the world's religions.  He also fails to acknowledge the crimes  committed in the name of god and under the guise of christian thought, not  to mention the control issues and power struggles that are so prevalent in  the christian world today.<br />Don't waste your time.... regardless of your  religious persuasion.... this book isn't worthy of the trees consumed to  make it.	1999-12-27
US	52579033	R4XJIQLWV4UHH	0767900553	962006070	Book of Shadows	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Oh My Goddess	I rarely say that a book changed my life, but this one has potential.  As a practicing solitary for many years, I found Curott brought a fresh and 20th century view to the Old Religion.  I have always said that we don't  choose to follow the Goddess, but rather, She chooses us.  And that tenet  is certainly appicable to Curott's journey.<br />As an attorney, she ventured  beyond the bounds of her everyday life, filled with logic, evidence, and  fact, and traveled into a world that often  defies physical law.  A world  governed by intent...<br />I especially appreciated her synopsis of history,  carefully documenting the path from a world of the Divine Feminine to the  patriarchal model we have inherited today.  Most of the world, especially  the world of organized christianity, refuses to admit how the Feminine was  suppressed and almost destroyed.  Yet the Goddess manifests Her wisdom  through those of us called to follow her.<br />This book bridges the gaps  between historical and contemporary practices.  It is an eye opener, and a  stunning example of the modern path.	1999-12-13

This book was a gift from a friend who understands my passion for quilting.  From start to finish, I was enthralled with the characters, and the bonding that comes from a common love.  The story revolves around a  group of women who share their lives and times over a quilt frame,  reflecting what women have known for ages... that passion can connect  hearts.  The characters are well developed, believable, and full of life.   If you liked the movie &quot;How to Make An American Quilt,&quot; you will  enjoy this book.	1999-12-11

After reading and re-reading the epochs of Marian Zimmer Bradley and reveling in past life memories of long ago England, I really was looking forward to a repeat performance and renewed love affair with the characters  and the energy of the time frame.  I was so disappointed with this  ploddingly slow, over-detailed, mishmash story.<br />The characters began as  intriguing and the authors did breathe some life into them, but later only  in a comic sense, overdrawn and exaggerated.  There are some good scenes,  and a fair mystery along the way.<br />I finished the book.... somehow, and  over the time of several months.  But its not one I'll keep on my shelf for  future reference and re-reading.	1999-11-17

Highly recommended for anyone who has a mother, and especially for those of us with mothers who really tried to do what they thought was best for us, even if it wasn't.  Ya-Ya  recounts the outrageous Divine Secrets of 4 young women, growing up in the  South, and how their friendship influenced not only their adult lives, bu  the lives of those around them.  If you have ever wanted to go skinny  dipping on a hot summer night, you will identify with these gals... As the  innocences of the 40's and 50's has melded into the sophification of the  80's and 90's, the Ya-Ya's solidify their bonds, more so to each other than  to their families.  This book is funny, sad, poignant, wistful, and just  too true.  What shines through the most is their clear love and devotion to  each other.... and their Southern heritage.  I gave away 10 copies of this  book as Christmas presents... to all my YaYa Sisters... May we create our  own Divine Secrets!	1998-12-21

The poor silk farmer's daughter tells the tale of her experiences during the Spanish Inquisition while  the new Queen of Spain  suffers the indignities of royal life with an impotent and invalid husband,  King Carlos.  While rooted in some historic fact, the book loses its charm  in the unending descriptions of body fluids and bizarre acts.  I kept  reading it, thinking it would make sense at some point, but alas it didn't.   Don't waste the time or the money.	1998-10-27

This addition to her chronicles takes the author on  a dreamtime journey to Celtic England where Catherine (Andrews in a  previous life) begins her studies with a wise woman and the Women of Wyrrd,  those ancient crones who hold all the truths of all time.  Celtic lore  especially fascinates me and the journeys and experiences of Catherine  serve to reinforce that we all share the same roots, regardless of the  lables we assume today.  I read these books for the spiritual truths  between the lines and found this book to have more than it's share.  A  delight to read and to experience.	1998-10-27

For anyone who loves to piece quilts, this book is a  must.  It contains patterns and instructions for hundreds of quilt squares,  some historic, some contemporary, and in a variety of sizes and  configurations.  Let your mind wander as you design 2,3, or 4 block  combination quilts.... I can stare at this book for hours!  Hopkins has  lots of good ideas, but some of her instructions leave a bit to be desired   and lack the clarity that a beginner needs.  But for the experienced  quilter who can make half-squares in her sleep, this books is just the  beginning of stunning quilts.  I have often taken part of her idea and made  my own designs from ideas gleaned from this wonderful book.	1998-08-26
