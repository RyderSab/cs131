I obtained a copy just to be able to read Miville's _The Tain_, which was worth it. DiFilippo's novella is great as well. Moorcock's story is only barely readable, but the story's sprinkled with an interesting collection of up-to-date political quotation. The editing is okay, and Crowther's introduction is short but succinct. Worth its price for the first two stories, and you could consider the other two as bonus material.	2004-07-29

Still, the previous novel, The fifth elephant, showed that Pratchett is getting a bit more serious, and this novel continues this 'new' style. The story of William de Worde, and of the power of the Word in general, can be quite serious in places. Still, the book abounds with humorous and funny scenes, and some of the best characters from Ankh-Morpork play their roles to great effect (no Rincewind though!). If you have enjoyed any of the other books in the series, you will probably like this one as well. Let's hope Terry continues to produce works of this quality.	2002-01-11

This book will appeal to both newcomers and those who are already accustomed to Vance's unique style. The (great) story is littered with hundreds of ideas, persons, even whole worlds. Cruelty is always balanced with dry humor, and Vance manages to create believable and likeable (although sometimes quite peculiar) characters. A definite must-read.	2002-01-11

It offers a view of the role of memory in a variety of contexts, thus looking at its subject from many perspectives. I think the book offers an excellent companion text to a course on theories of memory. In addition, it may be of interest to the lay reader as well, because of its emphasis on practical aspects of memory, and because of of its clarification of many phenomena that give memories a mystical air. If you're interested in a thought-provoking psychology text, this is a book to go for.	2001-06-19

This work collects a number of research papers from the 80s, thus offering a glimpse into the continuation of the work that was carried out with the help of the 'fluid concepts'-group. Hofstadter writes well, which means that the accounts of the projects that were undertaken are exciting, thought-provoking, and intruiging. I'm not entirely happy about the theoretical background to some of the work, maybe Hofstadter tries too deliberately to maintain things at a simple level. Still, if you're at all interested in the state of the art in AI research, this is a book you may not want to miss.	2001-06-19

It contains a thorough chronological overview of the history of codemaking and codebreaking. Included are numerous exercises for the reader, not least of which is the 'code breaking challenge', which was solved last year but which is still very interesting to try. Singh is very good at writing this type of text, as was already demonstrated by his other book 'Fermats last theorem'. Both books succeed at popularizing the scientific enterprise, and demonstrate that it is possible to explain higher math to the layman.	2001-05-16

The story has slowly unfolded throughout the first three parts, reaching a climax at the end of the third book. In this book, the purpose of the whole story is finally revealed. The sheer complexity could be a little overwhelming to readers who have 'forgotten' the story so far (thankfully, a splendid synopsis for each of the previous books is given), but it's all worth it. To describe the story is to give away the plot, I suggest you discovery Otherland for yourself. On many levels, it is a terrific cross between science-fiction, fantasy, and cyberpunk. Highly recommended.	2001-05-14

This story is really interesting, and is one of the few mystery stories that deserves a thorough rereading. I was astounded when the name  of the killer was revealed (of course, Poirot once more does the goods).  Very highly recommended, both for fans of the genre and for those who are  new to this type of story.	2000-05-15

It provides an entertaining and thorough stroll through the language. There are a lot of little differences between this  book and the other 'Learning Perl'. If you want to make special use of the  Windows GUI, you should check this book out. Combined with the reference  work 'Programming Perl', you will have everything you need to become  proficient at the language. Highly recommended for both amateur and  professional programmers.	2000-05-03

It is serious, violent, and epic space opera. The scope is reminiscent of Iain M. Banks, but Banks is a lot more concise in his descriptions. The prose style of Hamilton may sometimes prove a bit overwhelming, but all in all there is still a very good story  underneath all the verbosity. Most reviewers have commented on the erotic  overtones in the book, indeed some readers may find themselves offended by  the perversiveness of some scenes. For those who are willing to invest some  time in a really epic story, one which oozes realism at all levels, this  book is well worth reading.	2000-04-25

All stories are interesting for their own sake, and they provide a varied overview of Irish society shortly after the turn of the century. The book  is enjoyable at many levels, from the stories themselves to their inner  meaning. You can come back to one or more stories again and again, and  still they will not become boring, and I think that that's the hallmark of  any great work. Highly recommended as an appetizer to the other work of  James Joyce.	2000-04-25

This is an extremely funny and weird book, which is also quite intelligently construed. I think some of Rankin's other works are even more funny, but  all in all this book is miles ahead of most other works in the genre. If  you like Terry Pratchett, you will definitely enjoy all of Rankin's books,  and maybe even prefer the self-consciousness of his works over others. Very  much recommended.	2000-04-12

All plays (and poems, etcetera) are printed in a lavishly, pleasing way, very easy to the eye  (one of the biggest drawbacks of some editions is that they use a very  small font to keep the number of pages to a minimum). As others have  commented, not much can and should be commented on the works themselves,  they have stood the test of time, and the (normal) spelling that is used in  this edition makes each reading an enjoyable experience. All the plays are  given a brief (and somewhat succinct) introduction, which is, at best,  okay. The strange things, in this book, are, for example, the order of the  plays, the way King Lear is printed in two versions (that differ only in  small details), and the inclusion of fragments that are attributed to  Shakespeare (a bit controversial to say the least). Still, if you want to  buy a good, thorough, and well-researched edition of the complete works of  Shakespeare, you will not go far wrong with this book.	2000-03-09

The overview of the language is excellent and very  comprehensible. Even after reading Learning Perl and Programming Perl, I  picked up some valuable tips. The chapters on Object Oriented Programming  and Perl/Tk are also good. For the Perl/CGI part, you might consider  reading additional material, however. All in all, a surprisingly good  introduction and reference to Perl 5, both for the beginner and the more  advanced programmer.	2000-03-09

Still, the collection of quotations is one of the best of all, especially when you take an interest in English poets and writers. The book is well laid-out, and now contains short descriptions of the authors of quotations.  The book's index is also very good, not quite as extrardinary as  Bartlett's, but you will be able to find almost any quotation from it.  Highly recommended for both the just-interested browser and the serious  quotation-seeker.	2000-03-07

If you buy only one book  of quotations, this should be your choice. A good second is Oxford's, but  Bartlett has got the best index of any reference work ever (it is more than  700 pages itself!) The preface of the book contains a sour message on the  state of illiteracy in the USA, it is best left alone, but the rest of the  book cannot be recommended enough. In sum, this is the best reference book  of quotations available.	2000-03-03

Cringely is a very informed reporter, who is  not afraid to intersperse serious overviews with juicy remarks. This is a  book about nerds who became billionairs, which means it definitely deserves  to be studied carefully. Interesting and thought-provoking!	2000-03-01

Together with its sequel, The Color of Magic can be seen as the book that  shaped Discworld (although some characters, notably Death, have changed  their appearance greatly). It also introduces Rincewind, already one of  literature's classic figures. I always advise readers new to the works of  Pratchett to start with this book, and to read the others in chronological  order. Highly recommended to read and reread.	2000-03-01

I already owned Learning Perl and Programming Perl, and this book provided a very welcome addition to them. The 'recipes' are exquisitely explained, and the book  answers many (and I do mean many) of the questions you may ever have (for  example, how to get a random line from a file without loading the file  first). Like the other O'reilly books, this work is written in a humorous  way, and laid out simple and effective. If you're planning to do _anything_  in Perl, this book will be a great time-saver.	2000-03-01

The history of Apple, from its lowly origins to the well-known company it is today, is described in great detail. Most interesting is the development of the Macintosh, particularly  the role played by Steve Jobs. If you are at all interested in recent  history, you will admire the way in which Levy describes corporate business  of the 80's. Recommended.	2000-03-01

Most stories are short and intricate pieces, and often _very_ humorous. The stories that feature Reginald and Clovis are among the funniest; other  stories ('the mappined life') are almost gruesome in their ferosity and  intensity. It is a real shame that the author did not make it through World  War I, he could have written so many more fine stories. As it is, we will  have to do with the 130+ stories in this book, which I can read over and  over. Recommended to the extreme.	2000-02-25

If you know Oscar Wilde for his wit, you may find this book long-winded. But if you can enjoy a book purely as a work of art, you may find much inner beauty in this work. The story has great philosophical value, and the  moral implications are left open for the reader to ponder over. I have read  this book more than once, and it never fails to bring happiness at the  recognition of absolutely wonderful prose. This book is a perfect companion  to Wilde's plays.	2000-02-24

It provides an entertaining and thorough stroll through the language. If you are quite familiar with this type of language (like C, C++, or scripting languages)  then you should acquire Programming Perl (but then, you should buy that  book in any case). I bought both Learning Perl and Programming Perl, and I  have not regretted Learning Perl at all, because of its great tutorial  ability.	2000-02-23

Everything, from Freud's private life to his theoretical views is discussed. Gay debunks  many myths that surround Freud, and everywhere the enormous amount of  research that has gone into the work shows through.

The book is wonderfully written, although it may be felt that some of the compassion  that was abundant in The Name of the Rose is missing. The book is  intellectual for intellect's sake, and it is a great parody of the _real_  pseudo-intellectual type of mystic literature. A tough book, but you should  really give it a try, if only to understand the book's title.	2000-02-21

Like The Lord of the Rings, it should really be read in combination with its sequels, but the book contains its own strong  moments, especially the first section on Trantor.

It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not  your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then  you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through  this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of  Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But  there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A  reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is  the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap  'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it  is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite  chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the  book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try  it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You  may find you savor it then.	2000-02-17

Banks, this book goes high on my list of favorites. Very engagingly written, with a nicely progressing plot. Both stories are strangely intertwined, so loose yet so connected at  the same time. There is a touch of Umberto Eco in the literary style (it  does remind me of The Name of the Rose and The Island of the Day Before),  with the close observer being biased to portray events as he/she sees it.  Next to The Player of Games and Consider Phlebas, this book can be  considered a good introduction to the works of Banks.	2000-02-15

This becomes all the more clear when reading David Copperfield. It is true that some of the characters in the book are a bit 'artificial'. But this is amply made up for by the unbelievable 'reality' of other characters (Murdstone,  Steerforth) and the overall maturity of writing style. Dickens did not  treat the topic of his own childhood sufferings lightly, and it shows in  the almost unbearably sad first chapters. If you read only one book by  Dickens, I would recommend you take this one.	2000-02-04

Many reviewers have comments about the 'bad' ending, indeed the end of the novel appears a bit rushed, in any case it is not like The Sixth  Sense :-) Still, there are many literary gems to be found, from the  description of Freaknic to the ruthless description of prison. The  influence of Dickens on Wolfe's style is really noticeable if you are into  that kind of thing, and that is not bad at all. It shows literary deftness,  compassion, and above all a great story.
