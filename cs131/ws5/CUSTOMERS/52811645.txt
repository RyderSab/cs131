It actually had no SF in it at all. This disappointed me. The plot was a little dry, and the characters weren't that compelling.<br />I was disappointed, because I generally like Niven, and his other books with Pournelle that I've read have been quite good.<br />The story is about a huge city-in-a-building which sits inside of Los Angeles, and mainly deals with conflicts between the citizens of LA and those of Todos Santos (loosely inspired by Arcosanti, I believe, which is also mentioned in the book). It's psychologically interesting, but not much beyond that, unfortunately.<br />I'm being generous with 3 stars, because it was well written, even if it wasn't that good a story.	2003-07-29

It's got a certain realistic quality regarding overweight women that it seems is quite lacking in a lot of books.<br />The plot is rather all over the place, and as the book is written in a humorous and lighthearted style it is a little jarring when some of the darker parts of the story come along.<br />Overall it was an enjoyable read, though it's probably one of those books that I'll be able to re-read in six months because I'll have forgotten everything that happens.	2003-07-24

They aren't much more than that, and so going in expecting great literature would be silly.<br />I read this book on the airplane from Denver to Dulles, VA and it made me giggle quietly to myself in my seat and overall improved the journey by entertaining me.<br />In this, as in all of the Stephanie Plum books, sexual tension is near the fore in nearly every scene. Grandma Mazur is crazy and plucky as always, and all of the standard cast are there with their various personalities. Rex (the hamster) is sadly underplayed in this installment, however, upstaged by Bob, the sort-of-golden-retriever.	2003-07-24

This put me in the position of getting most of the references and jokes, yet not being offended by the humor--a good position to be in.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot. I took it on vacation and read it over the course of a couple of evenings. I kept having to stop and read passages aloud to my father-in-law because they were so amusing. The fake exerpts from the Kama Sutra are among the funniest things I've ever read.	2003-07-24

I liked it. I would have been very surprised not to have liked it, to be fair, but even so.<br />One thing that I think Rowling has done well is to avoid making Harry into some sort of perfect Golden Boy. He makes mistakes. He has character flaws. In book 5 he has turned into quite the grumpy, moody adolescent, in fact. The \\"bad guys\\" are still almost uniformly evil, though, which I think could be softened a touch. They could be a bit more three dimensional.<br />Regardless, the book was full of action and sub-plots and was a very fun read. We do learn a lot more about the backstory in this one, which is nice. We see a lot more of Dumbledore as well, which is fun.	2003-07-07

In fact, for the first several hundred pages, it was a fairly enjoyable read.<br />I was confused, however, when the plot was wrapped up two thirds of the way through the book. The story was over. What could possibly take up another 200 pages?<br />The story wasn't over. It really, really, really should have been, though. Really. Everything that happened after that was ridiculous, extraneous, and rather goofy.<br />New characters--nay, species of alien!--are introduced. A whole new plotline starts.<br />In fact, the book does this several times. It should have ended about 4 different times. The absolute worst, however, was the brand new, totally overwhelmingly important plotline that is introduced about 50 pages before the end of the book. Everything is tidily resolved in a whirlwind of implausible events that quite frankly insult the reader.<br />It almost seems like someone else finished the book for him.<br />It is also in the last parts of the book that L. Ron's anti-psychology views come out. The psychological stuff in the book is extreme beyond belief, totally evil, and really quite stupid. In fact, everything after page 600 was stupid.	2003-07-06

I enjoyed reading it in the same way I might enjoy watching whatever made-for-tv movie might be playing on USA on a random weeknight. My main complaint about the book was its totally bad way of giving information by way of really bad exposition. Most authors seem to be able to reveal things in a clever way that comes naturally in the story.<br />Often it is the equivelant of writing a character who comes out and says  \\"It's good to have you home; I see that you have sucessfully driven to work and accomplished your tasks there. By the bag in your hand I can tell that you have gone to the store and purchased the bananas, tomatoes, and pie crusts that we needed.\\"	2003-07-06

It took me a little while to get into the premise--time travel books always have that hurdle to overcome.<br /><br />Once I was in, though, I really enjoyed it. I love Scotland, and the book is set in the Highlands in the 1700s. The book is action packed and well written, though it does fall victim to the same trap that much of the action genre falls to: everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. In order to further the exciting action filled plot, the characters must of course be placed in as much peril as possible. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, it just makes for a little bit of predictability and eyerolling.<br /><br />If I had a complaint about the book it would be that there was too much time spent describing all the gore and violence, and that she spent too much time on the sex scenes. I'm sure plenty would disagree with me on those points, however.	2003-07-06

This book just has that action movie feel to it. I have to say that I enjoyed reading it, the way that I enjoy watching a summer release action movie. It was fun. Nothing deep, nothing fantastic, but entertaining nonetheless.<br />The book was written in 2000 and is set in that same year. There is an election in the book which had a few overtones of reality that were potentially a bit cheesy... though they veered far enough away from reality to not be overly so. The republican candidate was a senator who had formerly been head of the CIA. While Bush-the-current wasn't in the CIA, Bush-the-senior was the head of it. The democratic candidate was the current vice president and was considered to be lackluster and dull. Hmmmm. And there was a very strong third party candidate. Another hmmmmm.<br />The book had a lot of detailed info about rock climbing, which is something I know nothing about and which has never particularly interested me; the fact that it did hold my attention speaks for the author's knowledge and ability to write about the topic.<br />The ending wasn't one I predicted, which is another point in its favor... but the ending was one of the things that made it soooo action movie-ish. A lot of things happen in the last 50 pages. Major plot changes.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a quick and fairly brainless read. It would make a good airplane book.	2003-07-06

The villain was written well and always kept me on my toes. I really didn't know what to believe until the very end. I also liked that I kept changing my guesses about what was going on--it wasn't one of those books where I have it all figured out after the second chapter and then just nod along while they explain things to me that I'd already discovered. I'm curious about seeing the movie now, but reading the plot summary at imdb.com I'm a little worried... it looks like a totally different story!	2003-07-06

I would say that this book pushes the ability for the reader to suspend their disbelief... except that it is all true! This is the kind of book that you don't want to put down. The main character (the author) manages to pull off an incredible series of frauds, at an incredibly young age. After reading this book, I felt the urge to learn as much as I could about this man, and started doing research on the web for more information.<br />A fascinating story about an incredible person...	2003-07-06

It is short--under 300 pages--so it goes by quickly. The story is set in the Discworld universe, though it is not officially one of the Discworld novels.<br />The story hinges around a boy, a talking cat, a \\"clan\\" of rats who are also able to talk--the result of eating magic-contaminated trash. They run a scam, moving from town to town faking \\"rat plagues\\" and then doing the pied piper thing (the boy plays a pipe) and getting rid of the rats--for a fee.<br />Then they get to a different sort of town, and the adventure begins.<br />Good fun, cute characters, engaging plot... go read it.	2003-07-06

The author uses a lot of details from the actual archaeological record of Stonehenge and the surrounding area and builds up a fictional tale of how it all could have happened.

I initially bought this book thinking I'd giggle over some of Bush's stupider quotes and that would be that.<br /><br />Instead what happened was that I took an enormously long time finishing a book that scared the ... out of me. I couldn't sit and read this for long stretches at a time and so it took me literally weeks to finish. Miller has an agenda--I won't deny that. And even as left leaning as I am, I still thought that a few of his points were stretched--he would quote something and then give his interpretation of what it meant, and I would disagree. For the most part, however, he paints a pretty vivid picture of our current administration.<br /><br />I won't get into summarizing or citing examples, because then I'd be here all day, but I'll say that as long as it is read with both eyes open and your critical thinking hat on to pick out the times when he's reaching a bit too hard, it's a good book and I'd recommend it. I bought a copy for my mom.	2003-07-06

The continuing tales of the Starks, the Lannisters and the rest is told in the same rich style as the first book. The war has taken the land, there are ominous happenings in the North, and dragons have returned to the world.<br /><br />The knot in my stomach only got bigger by the end of the book. Whenever things looked hopeful, something went wrong. Great plans came crashing down. The heroes are not all heroic, the villains not all villainous. Once more, there isn't a clean division between the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\"<br /><br />This series is written in such a way that each new chapter takes you to the story of another of the main characters, and so you follow everyone's story alongside one another. Often in this style of writing, I get frustrated when leaving one of the \\"good\\" storylines for one of the \\"so-so\\" storylines. I feel like I'm waiting it out until I get back to the interesting characters again. Not so here. By the second page of each chapter, I've forgotten about everyone but the current character.<br /><br />The story is dark and at the end there is no resolution. Not even a small one. This series was meant to be read as a series and the books don't stand on their own. This is fine with me.	2003-07-06

Very few characters are all good or all bad. Most are sympathetic in some way.<br />They are also among the most tragic books I've read. So many main characters die, and so many things go wrong...<br />I recommend this series to anyone who is looking for something to sink their teeth into. Good characters, good plots, good writing.

It was a good story, but it could have been told as well (or better) in half the space. I got really bored reading about every single plant on someone's farm, or the names of every person in a room and what they did for a living... pointless details that didn't really enhance anything. It took me just over a day to read, but it seemed like much longer. It's frustrating to get bored with a book while at the same time being caught up in the story.

The premise of the book is inherantly weak. I feel bad saying that, but it's just true. I feel that Niven had this cool idea for a world, physics-wise, and tried to throw up a story around it as an excuse to explore that world.<br />The plot, what plot there was, just didn't go anywhere. The characters were so-so. It really may be much better in a larger context, and since I really like Niven, I'm going to give it that chance.<br />I have to say that overall, I'd call this book fairly dull and unmemorable.	2003-07-06

It almost makes me wonder if this is the cover art intended for some other book. The other book was probably better, too.<br /><br />Planet of the Damned was a short book, which is one of the few nice things I can say about it. I am usually quite easy to please but this book's plot was pointless, the characters were pointless... I never felt any sense of urgency for their situation or even cared if they lived or died.	2003-07-05

If you just want to read one or two of the books, you might come out of it ok... but if you read them all you will be sorely disappointed. Characterization is just flat out bad. The stories follow such a precise formula that each of the books is almost exactly the same length.

Dr. Baker brings her family to life in the pages of _Family Secrets_ so vividly that we feel they are our own. Her descriptions of her gradual acceptance of homosexuality in her family... the mistakes she made... the regrets she has... and the love, pride and devotion she felt are so honest they are almost painful to read.<br />This book confronts many issues--the acceptance of gays in our society, the social stigma of being gay or having a gay child, the tragedy of AIDS--but more than that it stands as a loving tribute to a beloved son. Dr. Baker is giving her son immortality by documenting his life, his passions, his thoughts... he once said &quot;someday I'll be famous&quot; ... what a tremendous gift.	2001-06-13

It was a fun read. The science was a little laughable, but it's allowed. The historical details about medieval Europe were the most interesting part of the story for me, and the sense of wonder over the past coming to life that Crichton is trying to convey comes across in wonderful rich color.  There is a bit much of the almost-solving-everything-then-another-disaster-happens plot twisting for one to really suspend disbelief, but then, it's an action novel, so I can forgive it.<br /><br />If you like time travel stories, you will enjoy this. If you like fantasy stories about knights in bloody armour, you will like this. It will appeal to those with an interest in archaeology, architecture, history, medieval France, and many more. I'd suggest picking this one up if you are looking for something not too serious and quite entertaining.	2000-12-22

I swear, I don't care about a single one of these characters, and the plot is so meandering... it's like being lost in someone's dream. While I find dreams interesting, they generally aren't coherant enough for a 500 page novel.<br /><br />I enjoy a wide variety of books, and I'm usually pretty forgiving. I usually read a book of this length in a day or two, this one took me over a week. Far from being the \\"book you can't put down\\" this book just seemed to ramble on and on. Each new plot twist seemed like a gratuitous and poorly thought through whim on the part of the author. I really felt that Clive Barker was riding his reputation with this one, as I doubt it would have sold well at all without his name, or even if he'd been able to get it published.	2000-11-29

A  book of this length usually only takes me a day or two to read, but this  one makes so little sense that it's taken forever. The author jumps from  thing to thing and place to place with little regard for her reader, who  ends up lost and confused. I still have no idea who half the people in this  book are or why they were in it, or how they relate to anyone else. The  book is horribly hard to follow and therefore lost my interest far too  often. I've not read anything else by this author, and using this book as a  guide, I doubt I will in the future.	2000-09-12

After her life is shattered by a Shawnee raid  on her small village, she flees her captors to traverse nearly 1,000 miles  on foot with only the clothes on her back and what food she can find along  the river. The writing is excellent, pulling the reader into the story and  bringing it to life.
