So an awful lot of Muslims themselves have never actually read the Qur'anic verses about women and tried to make sense of them.

This book, written by an progressive Muslim American academic with a Ph.D. in Arabic, should be essential reading for both the above groups.	2005-08-21

But most of the time, that's because they're reading it backwards!  The traditional ordering of the Qur'an puts the earlier, shorter and more spiritual chapters towards end (near chapter 114). If you read from the beginning, you see the long legalist chapters first, and the effect is similar to opening the Bible at Leviticus or Deuteronomy and reading through the old Israelite legal codes.<br />Michael Sells solves this problem by concentrating on the shorter, earlier revelations.  Since these are the first ones any young Muslim would be exposed to, it successfully gives readers the closest thing possible to a &quot;natural&quot; acquaintance with the Muslim scripture.	2004-05-12

It's indeed a gloomy picture. Arafat's puppet administration sinks deep into corruption whilst steaming in impotent helplessness, as the so-called peace process becomes a transparent tactic to block all real Palestinian aspirations for a viable state in the occupied territories. The Israelis and the US continue to block all real statehood negotiations until 'violence stops', overlooking the crucial fact that Palestinian violence is largely a reaction to the brutal Israeli occupation, and is impossible for Arafat to control while the Israeli settlement and occupation policy continues. So things remain in a deadlock. And meanwhile Said's health deteriorates.  Sad indeed, but unfortunately it's the truth of the situation.	2004-05-11

That nostalgic attachment to language led him to a lifetime of study of all sorts of Scandinavian and Germanic myths and epics, which ultimately inspired him to create his own mythology.<br />Carpenter also mentions that Leaf By Niggle, one of Tolkien's short stories, expressed his own bittersweet feelings about having spent most of his life writing the Silmarillion and Lord Of The Rings; especially given that advancing age made it increasingly unlikely that they would be finished in his lifetime. This was news to me, so I tracked down the story in a secondhand copy of The Tolkien Reader... it was really quite touching.	2004-05-11

This view holds that the common Christian ideas, that Jesus was the divine Son of God who was born from a virgin and died for the sins of humanity, were all later traditions invented as the early Christian community tried to make sense of the crucifixion and the fact that the world had in fact failed to come to an end.	2004-05-11

Every time Gandalf or Aragorn mentions Luthien, Earendil or anything else - it's a reference to events that are laid out in this book.  If these vague clues to the distant past of Middle Earth ignite your curiosity and imagination, read this!	2003-06-23

I thought Indian Killer was a bit of a disappointment, really... the politics were too blatant and heavy-handed, and the story lacked the subtlety and delicate touch of his shorter work.  But he's in top form again here.<br />I was lucky enough to see him read the last story in person.  It was an unforgettable experience.  As a friend who was there with me said, &quot;He makes you burst out laughing one moment, then breaks your heart the next.&quot;	2003-06-23

Tolkien: A Biography	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A personal, illuminating view of Tolkien's life and writing	If you've loved Tolkien's books all your life, and wondered what kind of person it takes to come up with works of genius like The Lord Of The Rings, The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, this book will be just what you wanted.<br />Carpenter makes illuminating connections, linking Tolkien's early fascination with languages to the fact that the author first studied languages with his mother (who died while he was quite young).  That nostalgic attachment to language led him to a lifetime of study of all sorts of Scandinavian and Germanic myths and epics, which ultimately inspired him to create his own mythology.  <br />Carpenter also mentions that Leaf By Niggle, one of Tolkien's short stories, expressed his own bittersweet feelings about having spent most of his life writing the Silmarillion and Lord Of The Rings; especially given that advancing age made it increasingly unlikely that they would be finished in his lifetime.  This was news to me, so I tracked down the story in a secondhand copy of The Tolkien Reader... it was really quite touching.<br />I'm  planning to read The Letters Of J.R.R. Tolkien by Carpenter and Christopher Tolkien next. I'm pretty sure I won't be disappointed.	2002-05-28

Actually it's a wonderfully written allegory about the transformative power of love (hence the phrase &quot;the new world&quot;).<br />If you just want to read about Tintin the comic book character, pick up one of the comic books.	2001-05-27

But this book completely restored my faith in Robbins' ability to come up with the wildest, most inventive and lusty prose out there =)	2001-05-17

I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants to install Linux for the first time, as well as set up dial-up web  access and e-mail, a printer, word processor, database, spreadsheet, presentation and appointment software (Star Office) without paying hundreds of dollars for it.  Very readable and good selection of information. A good complement is Linux Networking For Your Office by Roderick Smith, once you know the basics of Linux and want to set up a network to share files.<br />This book would have gotten 5 stars if not for one bad omission... it doesn't say enough about dual-boot installations.  in particular, it doesn't tell you that  if you're installing Linux as a second operating system with Windows NT or 2000, installing LILO in your Master Boot Record will make Windows inaccessible.  Since the instalation chapter does talk about non-destructive partitioning (which most people will only do for a dual boot system with windows) this caution should have been mentioned somewhere  to keep beginners from making this mistake and losing  their Windows partition.	2001-04-19
