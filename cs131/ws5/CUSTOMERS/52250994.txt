US	52250994	R18DUMBBBPUJAE	0380790270	118699015	Attack on the Queen	Books	4	3	4	N	N	SOLID EFFORT	I liked this novel, in spite of the often contrived martial arts scenes that were most likely written w/ film in mind.  The book was extensively researched, and I found myself learning much about China and of course, the QE2.  The Kellogg brothers made interesting heroes, and I'm reading more about them in NIGHTWATCH.  I would of liked Mr. Henrick to get the action moved to the QE2 sooner.  The last of the great ocean liners is the real star of this book, and I couldn't get enough of this great ship.  <br />The submarine action was a real surprise, and fit in well w/ the story.  Of course, what would you expect from the author of one of my favorite movies, CRIMSON TIDE.  If you find yourself w/ some spare time on your hands, pick up this book and give it a try.  I guarantee you that it will take you to several places  that you've never been before, that being one of my definitions of a good read.	2000-12-05

It's one of the most original  plots in quite awhile.  In a way, it reminded me of a technothriller  version of the classic movie, THE GOD'S MUST BE CRAZY.  I enjoyed the  details on Inuit life--it's apparent Henrick did his homework.  By  combining this narrative w/ a fast moving nuclear showdown story line, this  novel offers non-stop action in a unique environment, much like one of my  favorite stories of all--ICE STATION ZEBRA.  Give this one a try, you won't  be disappointed.	2000-09-12

Once again, Mr. Henrick takes us to places we've never been before, w/ an interesting cast of characters.  The plot moves quickly, and I can't get enough of stories  about groups of old timers called back for one last mission.  And by the  way, the very ending of the novel is a real surprise!	2000-06-13

A mad Japanese scientist provides the credible enemy, in a setting that reminded me of Ian Flemming's DR.NO.  To keep this  evil enemy from wiping out humanity w/ the most potent bio weapon of all, a  group of US Navy SEALS, a reluctant female scientist, and an eclectic mix  of veterans unite to save mankind.  I wouldn't be surprised if a movie  version is upcoming, as this story moves w/ a fluid ease that often appears  to be scripted.  Bravo, Mr. Henrick for a good read!	2000-06-13

Henrick combines his keen story telling ability with extensive research to produce this first class thriller.  Can't really tell  what is based on fact, and what material is the product of the author's  wild imagination.  A must read for lovers of mini-subs, nuclear strategy,  and of course, my beloved Scotland.  Good job, Mr. Henrick!	2000-06-05
US	52250994	R25PTO85KDZAM0	0821751166	258722798	Counterforce	Books	4	1	1	N	N	THOUGHT PROVOKING READ	In the tradition of ON THE BEACH and FAIL SAFE, COUNTERFORCE gives the reader a tour of American and Russian nuclear war fighting strategy.  Though it takes place during the Cold War, much of the material is relevant  today, as reflected in the recent interest in a SALT III treaty.  Henrick  keeps the action moving along at a brisk pace, and reveals some interesting  characters along the way.	2000-05-30

This novel is filled w/ passion.  Henrick displays a vivid imagination, and one can sense the developing power of his  story telling powers.  This is a must read for those who enjoyed HUNT FOR  RED OCTOBER.  Though not as technical as Clancy, Henrick has one up on the  master in sheer story telling ability.  Read this one, then delve into the  rest of his work.  You won't be disappointed.	2000-05-18

I've always wanted to go to the Norwegian island of Svalbard, and this story took me there without the cost of an airline ticket.  I like the way Henrick uses descriptive passages to move the action along.  Also enjoyed the way he set the novel in the  present time.  If you enjoyed U-571, you'll love this book, by one of my  very favorite adventure authors.	2000-04-25

Richard Henrick writes w/ convincing force.  Not cluttered w/ useless verbage and boring characters like the latest Clancy.  This one moves like  a high performance jet on afterburners.  Highly recommended for those  looking for something to get the blood stirring.	2000-04-17

In terms of interesting characters and fast paced action, this was the best Richard Henrick story yet, even surpassing CRIMSON TIDE.  He's taken me to a place where I've never been before, the fascinating world of  nuclear command and control, with NIGHTWATCH being in many ways a modern  day version of FAIL SAFE.  Can't wait for the big screen version!	2000-04-11

It moves like a wildfire, and never left me bored, only craving more.  I liked the lack of organized chapters, with each scene break marked by a time and place  heading.  Like an old fashioned serial movie, each of these breaks ended  with some sort of crisis, that kept me up well into the night to determine  the outcome. The Kellogg brothers are the all American heroes that I have  been waiting for.  I can't believe the amount of info that's packed within  these pages, and I still can't believe the way all the different plot lines  came together in the end. This story isn't for the wimpy reader, and I  recommend it for those who like plenty of action and a cast of characters  that read like a movie.	1999-12-07

Was more than surprised to get this book as a gift and then to find how very excellent it turned out to be.  Henrick got me hooked from the first sentence, pulling me right into the action.  There's never a dull moment,  and it's remarkable how Henrick puts together all the fascinating plot  lines into a final climax that sent shivers up my spine long into the  night!  I'm certain that the movie version will be right up there w/  Henrick's CRIMSON TIDE, and I can't wait for the next Kellogg book to be  released.  So by all means, read this novel--you won't be disappointed!	1999-12-03

I loved the movie version, and was surprised to find that the novel had an incredible amount of new story material.  The book helped clear up the  motivation of the Russians responsible for the coup.  Because of the  complexity of the plot, this book is a must, and I find myself reading it  over and over, learning new details w/ each study.  I rank this story right  up there w/ the great classics, and applaud Mr. Henrick on another job well  done.	1999-11-02

On the strength of Henrick's latest, NIGHTWATCH, I took a chance on this book, and I wasn't in the least bit disappointed.  I like stories that take me someplace that I haven't been  before, and Henrick has come up w/ a real page turner.  CONDOR is an  intriguing &quot;what if&quot; story, that presents some intriguing ideas  as to what really happened to the Challenger space shuttle.  The end caught  me by complete surprise, and I found myself visualizing each exotic  location that Mr. Henrick so skillfully sketches. I didn't want this book  to end, and from the Amazon catelogue, it looks like I have plenty of new  Henrick books to choose from.  Thanks!	1999-11-02

As an avid reader of sea based adventure stories, I've read my fair share of Richard Henrick books, enjoying each one of them.  Thus it was  interesting to read this first book, that shows all the passion and  incredible story telling of a promising writer to come.  The characters in  this story are well thought out and filled with motivation.  The story  moves with the speed of a runaway freight train, and one can just pick out  the creative foundations of the author who would go on to write such  classics as CRIMSON TIDE and his latest(and my very favorite)--NIGHTWATCH.	1999-10-30

Something tells me that Mr. Henrick was writing for the camera, especially when describing the martial arts battles.  I sense that there were others  advising him where to go in this book, as his usual instinctive story  telling abilities are a bit stretched in this one.  All in all an  interesting read, with fascinating descriptions of the QE2.  It should  indeed make a hit movie.	1999-09-13

It was a marvelous read--filled w/ edge of your seat action and interesting characters.  It's obvious Henrick's done his homework, and I sense that  much of the work was written on location w/ the military.  Now the question  remains, where has Mr. Henrick's work been hiding these years.  From the  book's bio, he's obviously been busy, yet other than seeing CRIMSON TIDE,  this is the first I've heard of him.  I noted from the list of  acknowledgements in the back of the book that he's obviously a Wm. Morris  client, w/ Rob't Gottleib representing.  Mr. Henrick, NIGHTWATCH is a  superb book and should have gotten extensive distribution.  As a publishing  veteran, I question both your agent's and publishers support level.    Obviously they didn't believe in this wonderful story, that should have  surely made it into the Times best seller list.  We desperately  need books  of this caliber to keep our business growing, and don't be afraid to seek  new representation for the next one.	1999-08-16

Finally got around to reading CRIMSON TIDE's book version, and just like the film, it's simply amazing the amount of action that's contained within these pages.  I liked  the detailed character analysis of the Russian enemy, something the movie  was lacking, and the nuclear launch protocol is right there to read over  and over.

I took his suggestion and read NIGHTWATCH in a little less than three days.  My blood pressure soared during the action scenes aboard the 747, and I'd like to know how Henrick  does his research.  Is he former military?  And do things like the FEMA  central locator system really exist?  Fascinating information and  believable characters make this a must read.	1999-08-02

I like a story w/ quick cuts and plenty of  interesting action, and this one took me to places I've never even heard of  before.  Henrick did his homework and it shows, especially when it comes  down to the intracacies of the command and control of nuclear weapons.  As  a former Looking Glass EAO, this story gets a solid thumbs up, and I'm  already awaiting the sequel.	1999-07-27
