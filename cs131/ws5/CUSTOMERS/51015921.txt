She even has included a chapter geared especially toward introverted people in her book.  After reading Andrea's book, I have used her advice to get a nicer (but cheaper) apartment by networking through co-workers and am currently being considered for a better job by using Andrea's principles at a recent pool party.

I found this book while desperately searching for something to save me from causing my 25 family members at a reunion to be ill.  As a cooking novice, I was looking for a simple guide that would not give me recipes, but would tell me how to do the things in a recipe, like browning meat and creating a soup broth.  <br />Boy, did this book save my life.  It had the answer to every question I had - and I had many.  Because of The Kitchen Answer Book, I came off looking like a cooking pro, instead of the cooking dunce that I am.  This book is very interesting as well because it tells you how to maintain your utensils and tools and gives you the history behind food.<br />My family went away well fed and not poisoned.  Thank God for Hank Rubin and his wonderful book!	2002-07-18

Most people are not taught by family, friends, or school how to find an apartment, buy a car, meet friends in a new place, get a 401K and insurance, etc., but these are the most important things EVERYONE has to know BEFORE they graduate from college or even high school, in some cases.  This wonderful book taught me everything I needed to know and even gave me sample apartment leases and resumes to learn from.  <br />The most useful part of this book for me was the chapter on how to find and live with a roommate.  I just moved into an apartment with someone I don't know too well yet, and we are getting along great, all because of &quot;Graduate.&quot;  Ms. Gustafson provides a roommate questionnaire with great questions to ask, so you know beforehand if you will get along with your potential roommate.  I hadn't even thought to ask most of the questions she suggested.  Ms. Gustafson also gives lots of great, useful tips on how to get along with your roommate and activities you can do together.<br />I highly recommend this book for all new and soon-to-be graduates.
