McGrath explores the Christian doctrine of Creation without himself engaging in any new and exciting methods of creation.  This book, steeped in tradition, does not move beyond traditional thinking.  If you are seeking an exploration of traditional thinking about Creation from the Christian perspective, reflected upon through age-old traditional works of art, then you may enjoy this book.  McGrath continues to conform (rather than transform) to conservative tradition with terms such as \\"Old Testament,\\" God as \\"He,\\" and Eve as the initial instigator of apple-handling.  Seeking the cutting edge?  Do not be fooled by the slick packaging or the short comment on the back-cover by Archbishop Rowan Williams.  (I expect more from Archbishop Williams.)	2005-09-06
US	53022963	R2QAU0ZQ4CH4VW	0670122637	659158466	Ancient Lights	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Ancient and Modern	Commenting on her desire to have sex with fairies (the real-mythical variety that steal freckles from the skin of inner thighs), the narrator of Ancient Lights, Fifi Leech comments: \\"Do I seem to your tired Christian mind too utterly depraved?  So be it.  Both I and my father, Sweeley Leach, know a truth - that in these furious times we must appeal to what you consider the lowest part of your human nature because it is in that region that your highest human nobility has taken refuge.  Until the spiritual revolution which is coming, you will - unless you are a member of the Children of the Remnant - remain staggering and baffled and choking in the brimstone pollution of this dying age.\\"  And so the amazing adventure of Fifi, Sweeley, and the Children begins; at the same time guided by and in search of the Criste Light to save the human race from itself and its machinations. <br /> <br />I finished this novel for the third or fourth time.  There is nothing like a book filled with absurdities and prophetic pronouncements to ground one in the reality of today. <br /> <br />Ancient Lights is so unique...probably why it is so little known...I suppose the closest comparison I can make is: If you're a Helprin fan, you will love this book!	2005-07-20

While in a California mental institution, Freddy, the Prince of Wales, tries to explain to the resident, short-in-stature psychiatrist the understanding of life that he has come to appreciate.  Freddy says, \\"...It (a ray of light on a statue) said to me that even souls grey are gifted and good, if only they will collide with a glorious and accidental ray.  It happens with people, you know.  It really does.\\" <br /> <br />Helprin fans will rejoice that once again the author creates a fabulous tale that weaves in and out of time, celebrating the redemption of the present moment in, by, and for beauty.  The \\"accidents\\" that befall the Prince and Princess rival the events found in Helprin's previous novels and will make the reader break the silence of reading with chortles of pleasure and delight.  Add the prophetic pronouncements and pokes at the present political scene, and one will be truly delighted that, after ten long years, another Helprin novel has been published!	2005-07-20

An absolutely wonderful, challenge-filled read!  Bishop Spong zings a bunch of zingers that will irritate literalists, elicit cheers from the &quot;spiritual crowd,&quot; and not mean much to mainstream, biblically-schooled churchgoers.  His analysis is sharp, witty, didactic at times, and...challenging.  I found a blend of Jesus-ism, Gnosticism, New Agism, and a we're-all-in-this-together-ism, all couched in very respectable &quot;Christian&quot; terms and rituals.<br />My favorite line from the book is &quot;Can we dare to embrace the possibility that we ourselves might be the second coming of Christ?&quot;  If you like to dance with that question, then you will enjoy this book.	2001-11-27

Probably not a good idea even though the author indicates that Angelo is a prequel of sorts.  The events found in this novel/study kept throwing me as I read Horseman eventhough I was well aware that it is a character study of the Angelo in Horseman.  Perhaps if I had read Horseman first my preference would be reversed.  In any event...<br />This novel/study is a love story!  Compact, austere, wrenching!  What I did not get from Horseman, I got from this book..lyrical, lovely Giono!  For example: &quot;We must take care not to grow passionately fond of anything that is not worth the trouble.&quot;  Angelo continually muses over how his heart has been stolen by a lovely perfume-fragrance which comes to symbolize a life worth living.  What lady wears such a fragrance?  Will Angelo ever meet her?  The answers to these questions lie in both Angelo and The Horseman on the Roof.	2001-11-27

What begins in The Sibyl is richly layered and continues in The Death of Ahasuerus, Pilgrim at Sea, and ends with this fine parable.  Each book is sparsely written and, with each succeeding one, the story becomes more &quot;fairy tale&quot; like.<br />I love Lagerkvist's theology, his use of paradox, and his constant examination of faith and one's relationship to &quot;god.&quot;  Each of these stories mirrors an aspect of life.  The setting for The Holy Land brings the series back to the setting of The Sibyl in Delphi which is now a ruined temple.  This final book is more &quot;scenic&quot; than the others; short vignettes that gradually come together and conclude a wonderful parable that stretches from the crucifixion of Christ through the middle ages to today.<br />Lagerkvist won the 1951 Nobel for many good reasons!	2001-09-01

The Marriage Feast is a compilation of stories that appeared in the 1954 book titled The Eternal Smile, and Other Stories.

Those readers who first approached Lagerkvist through Barabbas and/or The Sibyl will relish many of the same themes and symbolism; yet, the style of many of these stories is vastly different from Lagerkvist's parables, more &quot;traditional&quot; in form and structure.<br />My favorite line comes from &quot;The Masquerade of Souls.&quot; It reads: &quot;And what more can we know?

As with all good stories, this one satisfies on many different levels; for my five year old and seven year old, an introduction to dreaming, asking for what you want, and another spin on the classic boy meets girl story that little ones find so enchanting (and big ones, too!); for the literary sophisticate, metaphor, allegory and wonderful imagery; for the philosopher, little tidbits along the lines of &quot;If you don't step outside yourself, you'll never discover who you are...&quot;; for the lover of a good story that comes in a small package, a good story, one that slips up and down inside you with the tides.<br />I'll leave my review at that.

Very Calvino-ish, yet different.  Imagine short, descriptive vignettes of the unfolding of a relationship set in a uncaring city that is all about work, work, work.  Selfishness and selflessness are examined in soundbites that, in the end, come together as a whole and in a completely satisfying way.  Who loses in this kind of a world, our world?  The adults seeking love for personal gratification or the children that live in the periphery?  Or both?  This short, one-night read, unlike any Victorian, plot-twisters which Palliser has written, goes deep.	2000-12-15

This is my first exposure to the writing of Charles Baxter; that I will continue to read more is a testament to good writing.  This book was a joy  to read and I left it with a deeper respect for the differences in other  people.  From previous reviews, it appears as though there is a love/hate  relationship between the reader and the characters.  I loved them; laughed  at them and with them.  Each character narrates sections of the novel to  the &quot;writer,&quot; describing their lives over the brief period of  time which this book covers.  Granted the main thrust of each conversation  centers around love, but so much more of their lives is included as well.   The narrator-characters include Bradley, a coffee-shop owner, his  employees, Chloe and Oscar, his first wife and second wife and his  neighbor, a Jewish philosophy professor caught up with the  &quot;Christian&quot; philosopher, Kierkegaard.  Evil and love-absence  threaten in the form of Oscar's dad, Bat.  Jesus Christ briefly appears and  asks for directions at a wedding reception.  A fortune-teller predicts  death accurately.  Over all this or through all this, the sense of a Divine  Love emanates outward.	2000-08-22

This is a wonderful story of the reconciliation of life's memories of the  past with the present.  A Severed Wasp is a continuation of the story of  Katherine Forrester that began in A Small Rain.  While the narrative is  about Katherine as a retired pianist, through the use of flashback, the  story continues at the point of Katherine's departure for France to her  school-tutor, Justin Vigneras.  I found that reading A Small Rain first led  me to enjoy this book even more.  The book is brilliantly constructed with  present events in Katherine's life mirroring past events and evoking  profound feeling in Katherine.  Through ever-building and subtle epiphany,  Katherine realizes that a life long-lived touches a great many people and  that in continuing to choose life and engage life, one continues to touch  many, many people.  A wonderful testimonial for an active \\"retired\\" life.	2000-08-03

It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.&quot;  And  so the narrator's friend passes along a bit of wisdom early in this  magnificent book.  Of course, the narrator does not understand and must, on  his own, develop knowledge, sensitivity and imagination around the life of  the fictionalized-Paul Gauguin, Charles Strickland.<br />The narration is  cunning and subtle throughout.  The narrator begins as a young novitiate of  life, sides with convention, utters a few misogynistic statements (which  are good for a laugh/is this how women were viewed by some in the early  1900's?) and, oh so slowly, develops into a person of sensitivity and  imagination.  The transformation is subtle and quiet, ending with a  physical return to the place where it all started.  Those characters, who  he had originally thought so highly of, are still the same, mean and  opportunistic.  He sees their stasis and reflects on the greatness of the  man that he himself once thought mean.<br />With each new Maugham book I read,  I gain a deeper appreciation for the wonder of his writing.  The story is  effortless and at the same time loaded with significant themes that give me  pause for consideration.	2000-07-16

I am hard-pressed to remember two more strange protagonists in all of literature than Oscar and Lucinda.  That they meet, fall in love and make a bet on whether a glass church can be transported and constructed &quot;by  Easter Sunday&quot; for the benefit of an out-of-the-way congregation and  its minister is even more absurd.  Yet, page after page, I read, absorbing  the wonderful and vibrant detail of mid-nineteenth century England and  Australia.  Only in the world of this novel could these two characters be  &quot;perfect&quot; for each other.  And in being written, this book issues  a challenge to this world to accept that which is odd and unconventional,  that which is outside societal and religious standards.  <br />Somehow I am  reminded of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice; the interplay between Oscar  and Lucinda amongst &quot;strict society&quot; strikes the same chord as  that struck in the love story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a man and a woman  outside the &quot;norm.&quot;  This book is wonderful reading to get lost  in.	2000-06-29

What has happened in his novels, that I believe reaches perfection in Anil's Ghost, is his ability to use plot construction, short, descriptive  movements of a place and setting in time, to create a poetic work.  In this  book there is less reliance on the poetic words and more reliance on  movement of time and space and the feelings of the characters.  Each  section of the book becomes a line of poetry that dips, soars and rushes  along.<br />Another attraction of Ondaatje that was present in Skin of the  Lion and The English Patient and very much a part of Anil's Ghost is his  character creation via flashback and the character's subsequent interaction  with each other.  No other author creates this push/pull terseness and  angst-ridden interaction between characters.  It is difficult to describe  but very much a large part of why I enjoy Ondaatje's works so much.	2000-05-26

In this slight book I found poetry, philosophical discourse, the stakes to a game of chess, and one of the finest last lines to a novel:  &quot;...seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the  inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.&quot;  A  beautiful affirmation of humanity!  This novel abounds with thoughtful and  deep-inside-wrenching remarks, interlaced with poetic descriptions of  countless imaginary cities that live and breath the characteristics of the  all-too-real cities of the world today.  The progression of  city-experiences in this novel reminded me a little of the snapshot  scenarios in Calvino's Marcovaldo.  BUT, this book is still completely  different!  This book spurred my own imagination as Marco Polo's and Kublai  Kahn's are intertwined within the covers.

Then I shifted my reading-expectations-paradigm to mystery-mode and really enjoyed  this book.  This book reminded me of the novels by Arturo Perez-Reverte;  similar writing, arcane/spiritual nuances, good versus evil, who's in  control and who's being controlled.<br />I enjoyed the &quot;religious&quot;  subtleties in the book and also how Williams plays with the concept of God  in the paradox of good and evil.  In essence, the individual, in creating  their own reality, also creates their own eternal life.	2000-04-06

The imagery in this book astounded me:  it was fresh and new, very different from anything else I have found in books.  My love of Willa Cather eventually led me to this book of Rodoreda's.  Like Cather,  Rodoreda's language is simple and wonderfully written, her characters are  unique and the plot is so subtle.<br />I enjoyed how the passage of time is  explored in the main character's life; from early womanhood through the  ordeal of marriage and family to a quiet ecstasy of full maturity.  While  place plays a very important part in this novel, the setting transcends  Barcelona.  I sensed the history surronding the characters in the novel yet  realized that this story could be set anywhere.  I recommend this book for  Cather-lovers and those who enjoy a book of the passage of time.	2000-03-25

I am so thankful for  growing older and maturing.  Having done so, this book can truly be  enjoyed.  It is about maturing, deepening, remembering, and honoring.  It  is about relationship with the persons in one's life, with the past and  with the future.  Obtrusively thrust in the middle of all this is Fay and  the Chisom family, representing all the possible ugliness, crassness,  uncaring and unfeeling meanness of today's world.<br />I could write that  there is little that happens in this book...on the surface, but as in all  truly rich experiences, one has to go deeper and reflect to see the  richness.  After slowly enjoying the first 160 pages or so, the last 10  pages explode in complexity and interaction and meaning.

The little I knew of Beowulf prior to reading this translation of the epic was some mytho-poetic exposure in men's circles.  I had no exposure to the epic in my educational background (sounds like this was fortuitous given the comment on prior translations).<br />Given this simple background, I  approached the epic simply looking for a good read as well as to gain some  knowledge of the ancient story first-hand.  And what a read!  The 3,200  hundred lines need to be read aloud, as all good poetry should.  The meter  of the poem flows.  I found it to be far easier to read aloud then the  recent translation of The Odyssey by Robert Fagles (although I loved that  story-telling as well).  Despite the ease and lightness of the words and  text, I received a very good sense of the dark, brooding, medieval  atmosphere surronding the epic; a sense that this story was told around the  fires in dark huts in the cold north.<br />I feel blessed and more full,  having read this tale.	2000-03-07

Somewhere I read that Cather will eventually top Hemingway as America's finest and most esteemed writer.  This book floated Cather above Hemingway in my estimation and this was only the fourth book of hers that I have  read.  A wonderful, timeless story set in the early twenties (could very  well be today!).  A remarkable tale of how the appearance of a young man in  the lives of one family can have such impact.  Cather develops each  character around their reaction to the man, Outland.  Outland, a perfect  name for a character that sweeps in, lives intensely, whose intellectual  capabilities create wonder and who gives it all away.<br />The main character,  the Professor, begins by tutoring Outland, even as Outland tutors the  Professor's own daughters.  Outland betrothes the eldest who benefits from  Outland's creations with enormous riches.  The youngest daughter languishes  in the shadow of her older daughter's consumerism, which the mother  encourages, much to the disinterest and dissatisfaction of the  Professor.<br />The middle and last sections of this three-part book are  wondrous and provide the ultimate redemption and &quot;tutoring&quot; for  the Professor who is &quot;saved&quot; by the life which Outland has  lived.<br />The setting for this book moves from the attic-office of the  Professor in a small college town set on Lake Michigan to the mesas of the  southwest.  Each setting is beautifully described, in economical and lovely  language.  <br />This novel is a wonder!  Perfect, and the best that I have  read in a very, very long time.	2000-03-01

I believe those seeking guidance and strength for their own marriages would  be better served. There is, in so much of what is written about marriage  today, an abundance of techniques, tips and tricks to smooth the struggle,  if not attempt to eliminate it altogether.  L'Engle honors the struggle in  this book.  Her writing sings when she describes the most difficult times  in her relationship.<br />Life and relationship in marriage is about the  details.  L'Engle's descriptions of countless meals, sitting on her  four-poster bed talking into the night with close ones, and of  conversations held with intimate friends and family, are jewel-like stones  laid on a fascinating and well-told tale of one path of marriage.	2000-02-19

I am glad I was introduced and look forward to reading his other works.  This was a special read; deceptively simple prose, characters,  themes and storyline.  (Isn't it the simple things that are the best?)  The  book is loaded with religious imagery; the narrator, a 14th century monk,  the three-arched bridge, the designer and master-builder.  As in all good  literature the setting transcends the particular to the universal.  The  pre-reformation setting mirrors the world in which we live in today.  The  novel tells the story of old-money (the boats &amp; rafts, co.) and the  inherent old way of doing things versus progress (the bridges &amp; roads,  co.) and its inherent changes.  Over all this looms the State, both old  (the liege Count) and the new (the expanding Ottoman Empire), threatening  to undue everything.  Intermingled with this struggle are the roles of  superstition, religion and myth.  Wonderful stuff!	1999-12-26

I pulled this one off the bookshelf to read after seeing it sit there for many years and was captivated throughout the long, long length of the book.  What a period piece!   What an intricate plot of whodunnit!  Rich in 1800  English settings and in a convoluted family history where everyone was out  to claim their title to great, great, grandpa's estate.  Unfortunately for  the main protaganist, most everyone's claim hinged on whether or not he was  dead.  But after almost 800 pages, certainly not caring for any of the  murderous family members, I realized that I didn't care for the main  character either.  All of the characters in this book are very flat,  two-dimensional; set in a well-wrought, three-dimensional world.

Very few books merit a re-reading by me...Eight years ago I read the first edition hardcover of this novel.  What a beautiful book!  La Tempesta, a picture central to the tale of the book, adorns the book jacket.  I have  re-read all Helprin's novels, stories and fables over the years, they each  hold a cherished spot in various bookshelves throughout the house.  This  was the last book to be re-read.  I thought about it many times but my  resistance came from a sense of not wanting to alter or destroy my first  reading of the book.  It was too wonderful and exquisite.  The second time  was more so, a more profound joy and understanding. This is the finest book  by the finest writer writing today.  I am still appalled when I mention his  name in &quot;learned literary&quot; circles and there is no response or  recognition, not appalled at the lack of taste and depth of most readers,  but appalled at their loss for not having read this author.	1999-08-31

I was never read this book nor had I ever heard of it.  A pity!  It is beautiful!  Now that I have it, though, I will place it on the treasured books shelf as well as read it to my daughter.  At least she will be exposed to this at an earlier age than I.  Well-written children's literature is a blessing...for a child and for the child in the adult.  I could subsist on this type of writing for the rest of my life.	1998-03-09

I have heard about the &quot;numbness&quot; that allows a society to look the other way during the committing of atrocities and also about the &quot;numbness&quot; that overcomes the participants and allows them to go about their &quot;work&quot;.  This book does an excellent job in describing and emoting that numbness of the Germans.  I was disappointed in the character development of the book.  I did not get a sense of any real personal growth from either of the characters; other than the oft used learning to read in jail motif.  I was extremely disappointed in the narrator's lack of development; maybe that is part of the numbness...  I enjoyed the read and am thankful for the reiteration of the holocaust experience.  This horror should never be forgotten.	1998-02-16

Maugham, a master of insight into human nature, draws characters that, in a deep way, pull at this reader's heartstrings.  Why bother with the metaphysical pedagogue garbage on bookshelves today?  As an art, literature's aim is to explore questions that human beings have, and, in a well done work, provide a hint of an illuminated path.  The path that this novel takes is pure gold.  I am only ashamed that it sat on my bookshelf for so long unread.  P.S.  If anyone reading this review has taken a taxi ride with Larry, email me!	1997-11-23

Originally published in 1937 while the author was in exile from facist Italy, this book chronicles the return of the main character, Pietro Spina, to Italy.  Spina's hope is to restore the socialist revolution while in hiding, but learns the importance of other more simpler ways of life.  He is sent to a small, remote mountain village to recuperate from an illness and, while there, gains and understanding of the simple ways of the peasant folk.  These people are not interested in &quot;idealogical&quot; revolution but know only about waking up and putting a long hard day in at the fields  and returning home and going to bed...only to get up and do it all over again.  Bread and wine is their sustenance.  Religious symbolism is abundant in this novel which is basically about the rebirth of Pietro Spina into &quot;true&quot; Christianity/Religion /Manliness.  The relationships that he develops are beautifully and simply written in the novel.  I orignally read this book 12 years ago as part of a college course and, for some reason, return to it every two to three years.  Just finished it again	1997-05-07

I find far more evidence of God's humor (and much more entertaining) in the natural world and in my own life than in this Book.  I did find ironic humor in God &quot;saying&quot; in the book that the written word should be the least trusted.  Lo and behold!!  Another book!  This book stresses the importance of individual experience and &quot;re-membering that the individual is God&quot;.  While this was a dialogue with the author's God, it was not a dialogue with my God. Mine, thankfully, did not wake me up in the middle of the night and demand that I begin taking shorthand.  In sum, I would prefer to take The Bible to my desert island simply for the sheer breadth of story and room for interpretation	1997-04-06
