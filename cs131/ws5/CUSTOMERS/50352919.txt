Taken by itself, one would think the remaining 275 pages were a primer on how to get your butt-whupped at the company picnic of the NAACP. After plainly and deftly laying out in the first sentence the purpose of her book, she jabs, kicks and otherwise pounds on the kufi-donned heads of any black person donning race baggage without breaking a lip sweat, with such haymakers as:<br />\\"[Blacks] have not been left out of America; they affect rejecting it while availing themselves of every morsel of its benefits.\\"<br />Ouch. Or how about:<br />\\"If an upheaval on the scale of the civil rights movement couldn't do it, it is hard to know what it will take to satisfy the `woe is me' race men that they are citizens; perhaps a giant Hallmark card signed by every Caucasian in America.\\"<br />Are your cowry shells ringing yet?<br />Dickerson, however, isn't a simple race baiter. She just as easily spends the next 25 pages running white folks through the ringer, detailing the developmental history of slavery and racism as it has nurtured and been so nurtured in the west. From there, the rest of the book is open season on anybody without an open mind.<br />Dickerson possesses a cool hand when it comes to capturing not only the academic side of the racial shebang, but is particularly stunning at pointing out the ridiculous foibles of a people who want freedom by as few means as necessary. Her codification and critique of popular public-passed emails such as \\"You Know You're Ghetto Corporate If...\\" and \\"Ghetto Resume\\" puts her research firmly in the front lines of the debate, and yet, just when you think she's Clarence Thomas in a dress, she lambasts whites for contributing politely to much of the same crimes of ignorance and fear-based rhetoric as blacks. A great example, among many, is the section on Africa-bashing by whites to slip under the radar of the homegrown racism they claim to no longer possess as it relates to Africa's American stepchildren.<br />Dickerson plays for keeps, and despite what must be an obvious and careful noting of just-enough cases to make the points she wishes to make, she writes this book with more courage and brawn than any Dyson book, and with more on-ramps into her worldview than Cornel West has ever offered. You may not like what she has to say, but chances are if the rock hit you, well, you were the one in the pack she was aiming for. The question isn't how back is Dickerson. The question is, how black are blacks, and what does that mean 40 years out of the civil rights movement?<br />This book reads as though Dickerson wrote it like it might be her only one. Hopefully, we'll not have to wait long for another dose of her medicine. It goes down tough, but you'll be better in the morning.<br />(Review from KISO Books)claim to no longer possess as it relates to Africa's American stepchildren. <br />Dickerson plays for keeps, and despite what must be an obvious and careful noting of just-enough cases to make the points she wishes to make, she writes this book with more courage and brawn than any Dyson book, and with more on-ramps into her worldview than Cornel West has ever offered.

US	50352919	RV5XQQSNWIB3H	0743470796	291867770	Said the Shotgun to the Head	Books	3	22	33	N	N	Misleading, but still head and shoulders over his clones	Saul Williams casts one of his numerous talent nets into the public pool once more with the single-poem tome \\", Said the Shotgun to the Head\\".  A lone poem clocking in at roughly 180 pages in this day and age can likely be called a lot of things without even scratching the surface of the content or quality of the poem itself: Audacious.  Trend-setting.  Personal.  It is all of these things at one level or another and more, though not all of them as gray in meaning as the three popular critic buzzwords above.<br /><br />There are two things we have to clear up right off the bat: This is one of those poetry books that wouldn't have been published without some measure of the author's existing celebrity coming into play.  It's not Ashanti or Jewel or T-Boz trite - not even close; Williams is, at least a fine poet when he wants to be.  It is still, however, a bit of a reach in terms of being out-the-door publishable on its own merits as a poem.  Based on the layout of Williams's last title, \\"She\\", I'm almost entirely sold on the notion that this is the book Williams wishes he could have gotten away with the first time MTV Books came knocking.<br />Also, reading it isn't as arduous a task as 180 pages makes it sound, though the feeling in an interested reader is understandable: the Dover edition (a company whose editions are typically printed in as few pages as possible as a standard) of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" clocks in at 70 and 77 pages, depending on your edition, while the Gramercy edition cracks library whole rows of library shelves at a whopping 120 pages.  And because most of us remember how mind-numbing a trek poring over Coleridge's classic tale was in school, some measure of apprehension is understandable in an approach of Williams's book...until, at least, one bothers to skim the pages.  Many of the pages contain single words or fonts so huge as to warrant a large print advisory on the cover.  You could burn through the book in an hour, and that's if you take the time to absorb some of the poem's intentions, of which it has in spades.<br />Touted as an \\"account of a man so ravished by a kiss that it distorts his highest and lowest frequencies of understanding into an incongruent mean of babble and brilliance\\", the poem has an undercurrent of another, less story-oriented message.  An underlying mission statement and a tone of the artist as cutting off from previous incarnations pervades the work, to the point of babble for sure for much of the book as it veers from story to political statement.  For someone who has in the past stated in no uncertain terms that he does not strive to include overt messages in his poetry, Williams certainly crosses the line in this work.<br />Around page 52 the work completely jumps the tracks unapologetically into political pedagogy and begins to put on the chipped armor of much contemporary politic-minded poetry: word play for the sake of the sounds of themselves, clich&eacute;s, points that do not feed into the original narrative.  Of course, stating that the book is an account of someone so ravished by a kiss that they become a lunatic of tongue and thought opens the door for just about any bit of gumbo pot-tossing you can conceive of without appearing to fail at telling the love story being publicized.<br />It must be noted, however, that much of the unoriginal and derivative spoken wordplay that passes for contemporary poetry in this day age comes from laziness, arhythmic imitations of hip-hop and the cloning of the voice and soul of Williams himself, so here we see the originator of the voice and stylings attempting to set the record straight.  With lines like:<br />she had eyes<br />like two turntables<br />mix(h)er<br />in between<br />my dreams and reality<br />blend in ancient themes<br />and:<br />the bass is of isis<br />(basis)<br />and:<br />your curren(cy)t-sea<br />reflects an army<br />of dead men<br />(p.111)<br />...Williams gives us some of his trademark etymological dissection for etymological dissection's sake, blatantly dipping into the pool of complacent yawners of faux-deepness.  If you have to explain how your wordplay works (see \\"(basis)\\" above, though with \\"curren(cy)t-sea\\" and the text that follows it Williams shows that he is more sly than most who abuse the tool), then you either think your audience won't get it without hearing it, thought it was pretty good when you wrote it, or you want to show how words can be used to instill double-meaning to little or no point.  I'm hoping it's the last one.  Showing how flat and pointless wordplay like this can be on the page is a good message to send.  I just don't know if that's what Williams meant to do.  I can hope.  I also hoped I'd get away from what must be the mandatory John Coltrane reference in Black poetry in this day and age, but was thwarted on page 141.<br />Not that the work doesn't have its professional ringers.  This passage:<br />pools of blood<br />are not recreational<br />even lifeguards drown<br />when the undertow breaks bread with the under belly<br />demons disguised as sharks<br />have not put enough thought<br />into their costumes<br />(p.70)<br />...and all of page 172 soars with metaphor, and draws a line between Saul and his imitators.  Wordplay isn't good enough; there must ever be an idea behind the line, a program for the machine.<br />All in all, this is an audacious (ha!) book, but would have made a better two poems than one, or at least could have used a legitimate editing, not for length, but for point.  Of all the poets to make any semblance of a whimper on the poetry scene in the last ten years, I trust few more than Williams with a poem of this length to do something not only good, but wondrous.  He doesn't quite do that for me with this book, but it certainly sets a great precedent.  Fans of his work will lap it up, but will they lap it up because they believe that it is good or because he's the poet to watch for now?ological dissection for etymological dissection's sake, blatantly dipping into the pool of complacent yawners of faux-deepness.

Much like his incredibly well-researched yet accessible &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, he covers the history of the artist, his career up to the point of the record in question, and the impact of the record from every angle: financially, artistically, culturally, etc.  Getting the inside scoop from people who were at the sessions is priceless stuff, and the look at the times in which these albums were created gives one all sorts of new insight that simply wasn't available before the writing of this book.  When he breaks down how the album cover was picked, you know you've got the inside scoop.  Also covers the rumored &quot;lost session&quot; that had doubled instrumentation featured versions of the album recorded the following day (didn't know they recorded this thing in one day?

His books are many things at once: a mystery, a coffee table art book, a love story, a &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot; for grown-ups, and this book captures most of these elements (no love story for once) with ease and is a great starting place for people who might find the concept of picking up what is essentially a grown-up's picture book less daunting.<br />The concept of a limbo-like place for the dead to decide/uncover their ultimate fate is engaging and the narrarator - &quot;Non&quot; - does a fine job of carrying us along the thread of the mystery of the place and even himself...moreso in this book than in most of the others.<br />It isn't bantock's best book, but it is the one you might want to recommend to someone who isn't familiar with his work and might be self-conscious about being seen with a book with pictures.  The art in this book isn't quite up to par with the art in his other books, and there's a more stark presentation here (lending itself fine to the museum concept, but not as much eye candy as we're accustomed to in a Bantock book), but it's still a fine book.	2002-12-20

You can smell the attempt to dominate or be coy with the reader.  Not Croft.  Her voice is strong and instantly engaging, but not pretentious or faux-English like so many of her contemporaries.  The way the stories inside unfold is almost lyrical, but not in the sweeping, Jeannete Winterson way, and not as dense as Boyle, though fulyl as engaging.  Croft's style is earthy and warm even when the story is not pleasant, and this book is like a blanket of ideas and just the right words at all the right places.  Simple, but always digging into you slyly.<br />My only ocmplaint about the book is the overly-long last piece, the novella.  It's still in that great voice, but the story isn't as engaging as the others.  There are other stories and characters in earlier stories that I would have liked to seen treated to this length outside of this particualr one, so I don't think the problem actually lies with her, but with me as Engaged Reader: we always want more of the right thing when we find it.<br />Read the 4 stars as more of a 4.5 and get this book.  You'll burn through it, but you'll do so again and again.	2002-12-15

It takes a special writer to do this and still be able to keep the quality of his work above water, and Disch does this admirably.  The introduction alone is almost worth the price of the entire book, as he proceeds to rip every aspect of the contemporary poetry scene that deserves it.  The book alsoo contains a number of reviews of contemporary poets and books and even when he likes something it don't come easy...and who could blame him?  In this day and age when everyone can become a poet at whim, it's about time to start taking a hard look at what's coming out of people's journals and seeing what's what.<br />An incredible, tight bok of criticism that will engage you even if you don't know all of the poets he's talking about.

Despite the eye-catching title (for its time), we are treated to some excellent essays on a variety of subjects, which is a refreshing departure from much of the metathoery of his other work.  One of the things that people charge Afrocentrists with is not fashioning practical positions on contemporary issues, and justifiably so in many cases.  Asante deals with genocide in Africa, Malcolm X, gender and television with aplomb, heart and a solid voice.<br />A must for Asante fans, and a greta book for essayists, debators and peopel who love challenging, original thought.	2002-06-25

My concern lies primarily with the pacing of the tale: it's flat-out too slow, repeats itself for next-to-no reason WAY too often (even for a book that's split across a few titles it's too repetitous) and its flat-out anti-climatic.  The intriguing idea of a long-lost hero's return - beloved (albeit unbelievably so for my taste...smacks too much of &quot;Astro City&quot;, and not pleasantly so), powerful and righteous - into current day continuity was cool.  It ends up, unfortunately, coming off like a boring Miracleman book.	2002-06-22

In no other case is this more clear than in the work of Coleman.  She strangles a common story's possible endings and finds the one most compelling one for her voice until it screams, and does so in fewer pages than most lauded authors.  Her poems do this all the time, but her stories are gut-punches of the highest, most unforgiving literary tradition.  The most astounding thing about her abilities is that she does so while not making the work trashy or for mere effect.  Not for the meek of mind.	2002-05-19

The work is earthy, engaging and a legit story lies in almost every one.<br />Good stuff, and will impress the weird poet crowd if you're caught with it. ;-)	2002-05-19

It's the execution that kills this book, the voice in which the story unfolds.  Rather than show us the story, Major has his characters TELL us everyone's backstory, which leads to a lot of dishonest dialogue.  We're often subjected to groaners like scenes in which characters reveal things about one another out loud that people who've known each other most of their lives would already know.<br />Example: After being appluaded for buying a car as a graduation gift for the young lady in question, one of the guys says, &quot;We've been planning this for two years.&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, pooling our money, putting aside some each month,&quot; Dexter explained.  &quot;The same way we did to buy those rental units we own.&quot;<br />&quot;And the way we did back when we were still in college to get Ibn the start-up money for his business,&quot; Mike added.<br />Good God, have these people actually MET before this moment?<br />Not to mention that some of these brothers are just flat-out corny at times.  Some of the dialogue and prose goes absolutely nowhere and the jokes fall flat. It oftentimes ends up reading more like a product placement brochure (&quot;She picked up a bottle of Snapple iced tea...&quot;) than an novel.  When you're describing your characters as &quot;looking like something fresh off the pages of 'Ebony Man'&quot;, I mean come on.  It's fine if some lunk-headed character says this, but the narrator?<br />VERY light reading.  So light you may want to pass it up altogether.  Or you can get a copy from the library and count the groaners.	2002-04-29

It's a very tactics-heavy book, offering dozens of ways to navigate and control situations in mainly work environs, but in life ones as well.  Chockful of examples in a variety of situations, you'll not only uncover how you can manipulate situations, but why certain situations in your past may have unfolded the way they did against you. Some of the tactics seem a bit &quot;dirty&quot;, but the author makes clear that such labels are mostly judgement calls, and no one is saying you have to use them...just know when they're being used against you.<br />An excellent book for managers and employees looking to climb the ladder, or just the usually quiet person at the family dinner table amidst generations of chaos.  Navigate the rough waters to success at work and home with this lean, powerful tome.	2002-04-28

Since it's a bok of devices, however, you're going to want to look for poetry history somewhere else.

No other example of this intention is more apprant than Baldwin's non-fiction work.  His essays are timely (even now), filled with biting intelect, and brimming with his trademark ability to wind around an issue.<br />This book is all the more relevant because it saves you time: it collects his 3 book-length essays (\\"Fire Next Time\\", \\"No name In The Street\\" and \\"The Devil Finds Work\\"), as well as a ton of other pieces.  It's almost totally comprehensive in this respect.  Revealing and a more than trustworthy look at the man from his own mouth, and over the years.	2002-04-03

The art was dark and moody, the stories wound through a cast of character types unseen in a mainstream comic in years (some, never). It started with an incredible bang with the original \\"Sin City\\" book and took some fascinating turns for a few years, but at some point, Miller began to bite his own style, his characters now flat, lifeless killing machines with no purpose prior to the story at hand.<br />This book in particular gives us a character we don't know, don't know by the end of the book, and don't care that we don't know.  We just want to see how he's going to kill someone next.  Now, bear in mind: that's not why readers picked the book up, but that's what we've resolved ourselves to experience.  Where there is no heart, there is no caring, and this book doesn't have a character in it you can care about.  It's not that they're mean-spirited - that would be refreshing for Miller at this point - it's that they're simply one-dimensional: the dark, brooding anti-hero of few words who walks around the city helping barely-created hookers with the fighting abilities of ten ninjas...in his sneakers, no less.  Yawn.  Wake me up when you create another type of character.	2002-03-14

Ellison's work stuns, moves and forces one to ponder...if you're smart and keep a dictionary next to you more times than not.  He's a master storyteller, and in this collection are more than a few of the stories that made him an almost-household name, with some other normally overlooked ones.  He's an incredible writer - a writer's writer, even - probably one of the most honest writers on the planet (his work is filled with HIM in very visceral, itchy ways) and everyone should have at least ONE Ellison book in their homes.  This one is a great place to start.<br />However.<br />My only gripe with this colleciton is that it's ANOTHER collection of stories that tend to pop up pretty frequently in Ellison collections (be they book, audio, etc.) and fans and collectors will find themselves grumbling a bit that there isn't much new here to absorb.  If you buy his stuff at all you've likely got nearly all of this material already.<br />Great place to start with Ellison (it's not overly long), and designed for a new, younger audience (complete with pointed introductions to each tale and the book as a whole for teens specifically) that may not know who he is or how important a writer he's been to more than one genre.  Great classroom resource.	2001-12-11

Dorothy is sharp, and she cuts people to the quick, and in no better light than in this Penguin collection. She hates husbands, wives, smart-asses (though she is the preeminent smart-ass woman of her time), summer resorts...you name it, Parker trashes it.<br />The cool thing about her is that she does this with such cosmopolitan flair (small surprise since she wrote for Vogue and Vanity Fair for years) and obvious care (her poems almost always rhyme and subscribe to some traditional structure) that she makes herself almost untouchable to critic.  She's good, she knows she's good, and watch out world, here she comes.<br />Not just another pretty muse for a Prince song, and great for classes.	2001-12-08

If you're not into horror, take a look at it and read few right there in the store (which is easier than it sounds since most of the stories are only about 3 pages in length, max).  It's a cool collection of tales that you can kind of treat like a literary snack, a horror-d'vour, so to speak.  Plus, it really helps to get you interested in the genre and reading in general; you feel as though you're accomplishing some serious reading, even if some of the stories aren't that great.<br />There's so many stories, you really can't go wrong; there's going to be something in there for you, and if you run across a couple of stinkers, so what?

The book espouses a philosophy of freeing one's self from the bloated traditions of mainstream color wheels, towel rack-and-toilet schemes and expensive remnants, and finding yourself in the space.  Pictures of some of the homes featured are just out of this world, if not truly alien in origin.<br />It's not as loungey or laid-back as I thought it might be - this isn't that cool, after-7 bachelor pad book you're looking for, but it's close -  but it does have great, accessible text that's hard to find in most decorating books.  It's fun, listing movies and music to have for such an environment, and I recommend it for anyone who's into decorating or home-making...especially cats in search of some guidance about sanctuary-creation philosophy.	2001-12-08

He blasts movies on the premise that, if they're bad, they've lied to you and sucked the very life out of your existence and should be punished.  He's got lots of backstage insight and, even though a great deal of the films in this book are dated by the nature of the films discussed (ever seen a 10 page essay about how bad &quot;Gremlins&quot; was?) which slows the book down in spots, it's over 400 pages of the most erudite, informed, intellectually stimulating slamming you've ever read.  He makes you want to go to the video store and stock up on everything in the 80s to see if its as bad as he says it is.  I don't agree with every review (and some reviews aren't even reviews, but diatribes about how jacked up society and art is, and these are often chilling), but I am thoroughly engaged with every review, and what more could you ask for?<br />A must for movie fans or anyone looking for intelligent writing that dares you to not own a dictionary.

Out there is the writer...and more.<br />A wonderful novel about art, artist's rights and the dorm life of Princeton, this debut novel by Czuchlewski brims with cool characters, wit and a couple of &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;-worthy twists.  It drags in no sense of the word and let's us in on the mystery from various angles: we get to hear the reporter's thoughts as well as read passages from the paranoid's autobiography.

You get one heck of a dizzying ride written by a master storyteller.  A novella that oozes cool, menace and mystery - all told by an incredibly engaging narrator, the psychic in question - &quot;Mefisto&quot; is one of the best pieces of suspense literature in the last 30 years, and easily one of the usually-dense Ellison's best ever.

It's not good enough to get decent writers...the what-ifs have to be ultimately compelling as well.  They, more often than not, are the root of the reasoning behind readers picking up such collections.  Sadly, this book doesn't give us too many chair-gripping scenarios: &quot;What if the last snow leopard on Earth were threatened?&quot;  &quot;What if the animals grew huge and took over?&quot;  &quot;What if you could breathe life into paper?&quot;<br />Yeah, what if.  Big deal.  These examples aren't even true what-if scenarios (alternate realities, twisted moments of decision in time, etc.)...just fantasy or horror tossed into a what-if pot.  Asking &quot;What if you could breathe life into paper?&quot; isn't a question of leaping logic or missed opportunity or the world gone mad, it's fantasy, and when I want to read that, I go to the fantasy end of the bookcase.<br />Good idea gone bad.	2001-12-07

Some of it seems a little contrived, but who cares?  It's a modern day housewife adventure that could happen to any woman at anytime (it's charm), complete with stops in backwater cafes, bed-and-brekafast cribs and trailer parks.

What's this merry-go-round book about?  It's a factual study of the phenomenon concerning the release of a home video by a noted photographer which shows that the house he and his family has moved into is strangely larger on the inside than it is on the outside.  When doors and hallways start appearing in the house out of nowhere that lead to impossibly large and creepy places, the fun really begins and the true power of the book starts to reveal itself: its a damn creepy read.  So creepy and surreal that it has you checking your own closets and doors, I'm not kidding.<br />The audacity of the author is apparant in a mere flipping of the pages: there are footnotes to passages that go on for pages, some research, but some mere personal musings and stories by the editor.  There are pages written sideways.  There are pages with one word on them.  Everywhere the word &quot;house&quot; appears it is printed in blue ink.  There are letters in the back written by the institutionalized mother of the original editor.<br />In other words, it ain't no weekend book.<br />I'm not going to lie to you: I don't even get it all.  As it turns out, you need to bone up on your Norse mythology a little bit to get all of the author's meanings, but I didn't and still got a hell of a charge from it.  I was able to superimpose what I thought was going on and it made it even more personal and creepy for me.  This book is like &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; written by Albert Einstein.<br />Not for the faint of intelligence.	2001-12-07

All of the shorts that he's known for and that made him a household name come out of this collection as well: &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; (forget the movie...this is REAL horror), &quot;Trucks&quot; (which was made into 2 bad movies, but don't hold that against the book), &quot;Quitters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;The Mangler&quot;, &quot;The Ledge&quot;...this is all very concrete stuff that even a non-horror fan will take to because it's simply grand story-telling.	2001-10-03

It's hardcover, it's longer than your average comic book, and it's usually a self-contained story or story arc from a series.  This is one of the former types of GNs, and likely one of the best GNs I've ever read.  It's so good, non-comic book readers who venture to pick it up will likely find themselves drawn quickly and uncontrollably to the story and characters.<br />And why not?  Anybody who's been living on Earth for the past 50 years already knows these characters: The Justice League of America, specifically Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Aquaman and Martian Manhunter.<br />You know, the Super Friends.<br />This graphic novel actually takes off from an idea from one of te old &quot;Super Friends&quot; cartoons and runs with it like an Olympian quarterhorse: what would happen if there was an anti-matter version of our own world, where things that were good are bad?  What would happen if beings from these alternate dimensions found their way to their counterpart realities?<br />Think of that old &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, where the Federation was a pirate outfit and Mr. Spock had a goatee.<br />Now think if Batman killed cops, Superman fried citizens who questioned him with x-ray vision and Wonder Woman was a sex-craved vixen with super strength.<br />White Boy Kevin said, &quot;wow&quot;.<br />The story starts off with an interesting twist right off the bat: Lex Luthor is the only GOOD person on this alternate Earth and breaks through the dimensional anti-mater barrier to get to our Earth to recruit the JLA to come back to his world and fix things.  They go, and mayhem ensues on both sides of the barrier (don't want to give anything juicy away), as the worlds slowly start a collision course that could mean the extinction of both realities.<br />Powerful, epic stuff here, folks, and filled with intelligence, humor and characters you don't want to see go away, even if they are evil.<br />Thanks to the deft writing of Grant Morrison (living legend in comic writing who wrote the first 20 or so issues of the new JLA book that's hot now), you are as equally drawn to the evil characters as you are your favorite icons.  Especially when you see OwlMan and Super Woman (you match them up; it's fun) necking behind every corner of the villain clubhouse, and Ultraman (Superman-minus) using his x-ray vision to fry citizens and cats in trees.<br />Quitely's art is phenomenal, and his style, which lends all kinds of interesting depth to his regular &quot;The Authority&quot; series, literally pumps up the volume of the characters in JLA: Earyth 2.  Superman LOOKS like a super man, and Super Woman (the evil Wonder Woman) changing from her alter-ego to her villain persona is, well, downright sexy.  Muscles ripple, buildings explode, and heroes look like heroes.<br />Anyone who thinks comic books are for kids and are immature fare haven't the faintest clue as to what's going on in that medium anymore.  Comics are filled with incredible stories, lessons and are ten times more mature work more times than not than the average movie that no one seems inclined to dismiss as juvenile (unless it's animated, of course, which flies in the face of logic when &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot; totally slam most contemporary films in scope, story and sense).<br />Pick it up.  You WON'T be sorry.  If the price makes you balk (tip: don't buy it at a comic store; they'll charge you cover.  Go to Media Play), pick it up at your local library.  Then, if you really got balls, pick up some &quot;Hellblazer&quot;.led with intelligence, humor and characters you don't want to see go away, even if they are evil.<BR>Thanks to the deft writing of Grant Morrison (living legend in comic writing who wrote the first 20 or so issues of the new JLA book that's hot now), you are as equally drawn to the evil characters as you are your favorite icons.

It's horrific, smart and filled to the gills with great characers.<br /><br />The book relates the story of a travelling circus and freak show - The Peabody-Ozymandias Traveling Circus and Oddity Emporium - that, while entertaining (and grossing-out) folks, seeks out pieces of a mysterious machine that threatens all humanity upon its completion.  We're treated to all sorts of weirdos, and they're downright frightening, kids.  The fiction treatment of even the common types of freak show participants - the mystic, the fattest man, snake-boy - is chilling.<br /><br />This is a super-rare paperback book, but if you come across it ANYWHERE, even if you don't like horror, get it.	2001-09-17

The challenge of the play in book format was whether or not I could &quot;see&quot; the play as I read it. I could, and what a sight it was!<br />It is the story of two low-rent hustlers who try to outscore a local drug dealer and find themselves hiding out in an apartment waiting for the right time to make good their escape. After introducing one of of the hustler's childhood friends called in for help, the story quickly takes on more depth, solid characterization and moral study than its meager 50-odd pages conveys. Riff Raff is a solid piece of storytelling and you can tell that it's been written by an actor: its sweeping monologues would challenge the reserves of any county fair auctioneer, while its way of telling the life stories of the characters in such little time speaks to the more-than-capable abilities of the play's acting-minded autuer and not to any characters' lack of depth.<br />While it has a great deal of profanity, it doesn't push the reader away from the story. A must for anyone interested in theater, college students majoring in acting or creative writing, and writers of short stories of any stripe, as it spoke to me.	2001-06-25
US	50352919	R3T4POT499WBUW	0879306149	494327719	Behind the Glass: Top Record Producers Tell How They Craft the Hits	Books	4	31	34	N	N	Great resource, but how does it rate for up-and-comings...?	The other really good reviews tell you what you want to know about the logistics of the book.  I want to talk about whether or not an up-and-coming musician/producer/composer can use the book in their daily work and professional lives to any useful extent.<br />My quick answer is absolutely. It's chockful of great interviews with unquestionable legends in the field.  We always hear about the artists and get these clunky, chopped up interviews in magazines with them about what it took to make the record (&quot;I had a dream&quot;, &quot;My contract was about up&quot;, &quot;It's an homage to field mice&quot;, etc.), but we rarely get such an in-depth look at who REALLY makes these artists SOUND they way they do.  There's a ton of stuff about the gear they use, how they use it and why they use it.<br />The slant of the book is a little high-end, which is understandable, considering the professional level of the producers we're talking about here, so the average joe in their bedroom or basement studio may find the discussions about $10,000 microphones a bit overwhelming and useless, but the theories about how they're used and what environments (an aspect of recording SADLY bypassed by big and small name studios alike) they're striving to create are invaluable, and can be applied everywhere.<br />If you're an aspiring artist, get it because it will tell you where the lines are in your working relationships with these people, and help you help yourself instead of looking at the studio clock with 6 more tracks you'd like to lay.  If you're a session musician, you'll probably find it useful when the discussions turn to getting good sounds out of your instruments in various environments. And if you're an aspiring producer, you HAVE to get it.  It's your guide through ego, business and the nature of what you wish to do.	2001-01-05
US	50352919	R1XQGE82C7MG25	0312185782	256165751	Faraday's Popcorn Factory	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Incredible tale, but not for the faint of taste	Before I start, read the other reviews prior to this one.  They cover enough elements of the story itself.  What I want to review is the MOOD and REWARDS of the book; how it rates with other books that are marketed to the same people (Black women).<br />I'll be this honest:  I had, like a lot of people I know who love to read (not just love the idea THAT they are particpating in the act of reading, but find that they have a true passion for words and seek out original, fresh ideas), recently gotten sick of most of the books by Black authors out here.  Every book was a romance, and most of them thinly veiled attempts to pass off autobiography-diary as epistolary fiction.  On top of that, if I had to read another so-so written book by someone in first person narrative (&quot;I woke up this morning next to a man I met the night before&quot;, &quot;I went to the club&quot;, &quot;I...&quot;), I was going to cut up my library card. I am so sickened by the better part of these works that I almost hate walking down the Black aisle in a bookstore...so much incestuous ripping-off and just plain bad stuff.<br />So when I saw &quot;Faraday's&quot;, I was wary.  I picked it up and read the jacket and checked out the author's pic.  I flipped to the middle of the book to see what perspective the story was being told in (&quot;aghh!  First person!  And MULTIPLE, at that!&quot;).  I sighed, I hemmed and hawed.<br />Then I read the first 10 pages.<br />They started off in short, sweet journal-like entries, which were easily dissovable and got me interested.  I'd become accustomed to letting the same ol' normal words in the same ol' normal situations wash over me and getting the story through a feeling of the book, but I couldn't get through these passages that way.  I had to stop and go &quot;equinoxes&quot; and &quot;sparkling solitude&quot;; literaly say the words aloud a bit to taste them.<br />I like a book that challenges me, that makes me think and feel at the same time; that makes me want to add words to my everyday speech.  &quot;Faraday's&quot; does that to stunning effect. I admit, this is not a book for the average book club group accustomed to &quot;Cheaters&quot; or &quot;How Stella...&quot;; this is high reading for solitary, moody evenings, and you almost have to prepare yourself before sitting down with it.<br />Thank God a book can still make me want to do that.makes me want to add words to my everyday speech.  &quot;Faraday's&quot; does that to stunning effect.

If you've never been to an open mic or a slam, give this one a  whirl...it'll make you want to go (and maybe even slip a poem in your  pocket before you lock the door).  If you've been to an open mic and  wondered what else was out there that was like what you just saw, this book  captures a great many of those elements for you.<br />Not just a book of  poems, throughout the work are placed a great many essays written by  long-time, well-known National slam poets (Taylor Mali, Danny Solis, etc.)  about nearly every aspect of reading and performing one's work...a  long-overdue codification of information for performing poets at ANY  level.<br />Some of the poems contained within are national favorites, a few  legend, but they ALL contain a lesson about performance poetry: that it  starts on the page.<br />A MUST have for any poet who is (or is considering)  performing their poetry before audiences in any capacity.  A necessary bit  of packing for any poet with national aspirations of slamming, touring or  just reading.	2000-08-18
US	50352919	RRX3TRN9FPBI	038529929X	313045692	Hannibal: A Novel	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Good, but unfaithful, rendering of great characters	Yes, the boook is meticulously researched and has Harris' patented dense style of storytelling all through it.  Yes, it makes you want to turn page after page in a rush to see what happens next, all the while feeling just a  little bit smarter as you make your way through it.  Yes, the story moves  once you get past the first 50 pages or so, and has some fairly graphic  spots.  Yes, the gang is all here...but what the heck are they  doing!<br />Without revealing anything about the book that would spoil it  for anyone out there, let me just say that while these characters looked,  sounded and walked like the characters we've all come to know from Harris'  books (and the faithful-enough movies &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and  &quot;Manhunter&quot;), the ending spoils the whole, wickedly delightful  journey for me.  Hundreds of pages of powerhouse storytelling culminate in  a dissapointing and totally untrue-to-form ending for all involved, and had  I not been a fan of the characters anyway, I would have felt it was total  money wasted.  It is for this very reason - and not so much the gore of it  all - that Jodie Foster doesn't want to do the movie as it stands: the  character ends up untrue to what we've been led to believe she was capable  of all along.<br />I got the sense that Harris felt as if he:  a) was tired of  the characters anyway b) didn't want to have to go through the pressure of  doing ANOTHER book after this one with these characters c) was rushed (even  though it took 10 years to see this one come through the gates) d) was  tired of the character Hannibal.<br />I recommend it for fans of the  characters/movies, since your curiosity won't let you NOT get it, but  beware: it's a great investment of time and energy with little payoff in  the end.	2000-03-10

Spots of it are the West we see on TV and embraced by rappers and activists (even features a TV interview w/ Bill Moyers, which West admits blew him up in the public  eye), but a good deal of it is the hard-core scholarshiup that keeps the  respect of his peers...even the ones who probably don't like him.  If  you're looking for an introduction into his work, get &quot;Race  Matters&quot;.  This is for the fan seeking to trace where West has been  coming from.	2000-03-07

Except this.  If you've read any Cornel West or Manning Marable, you've already been on this territory before, and seen it done better.  Mosley strolls along, picking through whatever  happens to catch his eye in the newspaper, it seems, and levels personal  comment on it.  Okay, but is it interesting?  Not to me...and I CARE about  the issues he discusses.  I live them.  The book just didn't tell me  anything I didn't know, and you get the feeling he already knows this when  you read it.	2000-03-02

Just because you liked the movie &quot;Slam&quot; or enjoy open mics, don't go to this book thinking you'll get the same high.  Most poetry that sings on the stage doesn't always do so on the page, but  &quot;Seventh&quot; does so more than others. It's a far more accessible  collection than Williams' &quot;She&quot;, but again: you'd better like  poetry on the page before you jump into this.	2000-01-02
