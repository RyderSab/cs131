US	28239390	RNE36LMKSLOCS	067973452X	286460989	Notes from Underground (Vintage Classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Unruly real	This was my first reading of Dostoyevsky and having finished it, I cannot wait to read more of this brilliant author.    What I like most about this book is the shocking realism. The author hides nothing, and reveals the weaknesses of his main character shamelessly. The 'antihero' in this story is the most pathetic character I have ever encountered. I truly felt sorry for him. This story basically tells the tale of a man wholey consumed and overwhelmed by the basic decisions required in the most mundane of living situations. The needless self-degradation and obsessive questioning of motives leads to an endless cycle of disappointment.    I really enjoy the style of this book. Almost conversational in quality, almost mystical in it's take on the most ordinary of lives.    I recommend this book to anyone.	2005-09-11

This book is hilarious and insightful. <br /> <br />I once again found myself captivated by Jessica's self-discoveries. Each character in this story is well developed and the interactions are highly realistic. I also like the journal-esque format and found this to be a quick and very fun read. <br /> <br />I would suggest reading 'Sloppy Firsts' before this book, though it is not necessary. They are both amazing novels, for men and women. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book and 'Sloppy Firsts'. Be on the lookout for 'Charmed Thirds' due out April '06.	2005-08-20
US	28239390	REG3Z1FJI6XL4	0316569321	613460974	White Oleander	Books	5	1	1	N	N	True life	I found this story to be highly realistic in portraying experiences in the fostercare system.     The main character (Astrid)is forced into foster care when her mother is sent to prison for murder. Subsequently, the dynamics of their relationship change dramatically. As both mother and daughter sift through the past and future, it becomes clear that neither of them care much for the other.    This book is certainly heart-breaking at times. Having worked with foster children, I found Astrid's experiences in foster homes to be very accurate and commonplace, although few would believe it. I found some of Astrid's decisions a bit disgusting, yet still felt sympathy for her. Astrid's mother is a selfish dreamer whom Astrid eventually confronts.     This is a great coming of age story. It also gives a realistic look into life as a ward of the state.    I recommend this book to anyone.	2005-08-20

The book is so much fun to read and I certainly related to Rob and his pessimistic, selfish, cynical views on his world and the people in it. I had to put it down a few times so that I could finish laughing without losing my place. I read the whole thing in two nights... it really is a page-turner. And even though I knew the outcome I still found myself totally wrapped up in the story. <br /> <br />I love this book and the movie. I highly recommend both.	2005-08-17
US	28239390	R48Z9T36G3ZYC	0805072004	614541409	Fault Line	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Both sides	I read this book straight-through in just a few hours. The main character (Becky) is well written and I like that the premise is set around Becky seeking a career as a stand-up comic. This is the first YA fiction book I have read where the main female character does not run track, and Becky's mother actually pays attention to her and is supportive. <br /> <br />This book explores the issue of abuse. I have to admit that once Becky 'fell in love' I felt angry and disgusted. At first Becky is certain she is 'in love'. It is the typical, consuming, elating, blissful, 'I have-found-my-soulmate' obsessive love that people so often mistake for the real thing.  <br /> <br />Later on Becky devotes all of her mental time to thinking of how best to approach her boyfriend, being sure to tread lightly. It baffles me that people will turn their whole existence upside down just to spend every conscious moment thinking about or being with that special someone. As Becky soon finds out, relationships of this nature are never healthy. <br /> <br />What I liked about this particular book is that the author explores the issues of abuse from the side of both the perpetrator and victim. Of course physical violence and verbal abuse are horrible and harmful. In this story the abuser realizes that he has an issue that cannot be fixed quickly.  <br /> <br />I applaud the author for making it a point to say that change takes time. Too often people want a quick-fix. The fact is some things can't be patched up, wiped clean, and disposed of in a few days or weeks. <br /> <br />I still find the issues of abusive relationships confusing and often unthinkable. I do think it is important to look at the dynamics though, rather than chalk problems up to a black and white good guy bad guy explanation. If it were that simple I imagine less people would find themselves caught up. <br /> <br />I especially recommend this book to teens.	2005-08-09
US	28239390	R33YPYXUPJLQIW	037542315X	399450000	Pearl: A Novel	Books	4	13	16	N	N	Not as it seems	This book turned out not at all what I expected. After reading the first 20 pages or so, I assumed it was simply a tale of a mother rescuing her daughter. It is that but not what I thought. <br /> <br />What I found enjoyable and unique about the writing style is that the story is told from all points of time and person. Though this could be confusing, the author does an excellent job of maintaining pace and direction when switching from narration to dialogue. The narrator is never revealed although the story unfolds as a re-telling from some future perspective. Almost like listening to someone tell you a story of 3 people he/she once knew. At points the story is also written from the present, first-person point of view. This offers the reader a glimpse into each character's frame of mind and certainly adds realism. <br /> <br />I love also that the 'narrator' uses the events of the plot to raise philosophocal questions. The author asks the reader 'why do we choose to live?', 'is there anything unforgivable, and if not then what of justice?'. I found this extremely intriguing, as if I was somehow playing a part in the outcome of the book.  <br /> <br />Another thing the author accomplishes is presenting, through the characters, the idea that people are not always what they seem or who we think them to be. Each of us has the capacity for good and bad, the ability to help or to harm, to believe or discredit. I think this book is a wonderful look into the human experience. <br /> <br />My only fault with this book is the editing. I listed at least 4 grammatical errors and typos. Although I could infer what the author meant to say, I find it highly aggravating that highschool teachers pay more attention to spelling and grammar than a major publishing company. If you expect thousands of people to read your work, I would hope that you would have it proof-read enough times to fix common mistakes. <br /> <br />Other than the typos, I found this book very enjoyable and thought-provoking. I recommend it to anyone.	2005-08-08

If you are a dude thinking about reading this book but worried about reading 'chick lit'... get over it. All you need is a sense of humor, not a vagina.    Aside from the 300+ reviews here on Amazon, I have read other good reviews of this book and so I decided to give it a chance. I am so glad I did!! This book really got me in touch with my angsty, questioning, cynical teen self.    This book is essentially a diary written by the main character (Jessica Darling). The author does a splendid job of relating the spiraling and conflicting, confusing, and always intense emotions of teens. With all of the crap-o-rama involved in daily highschool routine, Jessica lets the reader in on her private 'perspective'.     I don't suppose this book is intended to raise deep philosophical questions, but I did find myself re-thinking certain ideas I felt sure about. Mainly how people relate to each other. Aside from the sarcasm and wit there is a bare-bones honesty attitude that I love about this book. I would say more but I'm sure the other reviewers have used all of the possible cliches for a young adult fiction novel.    I am definitely looking forward to reading 'Second Helpings' and... drumroll... 'Charmed Thirds'. Due out April '06.    I recommend this book to anyone.	2005-07-22

The author very accurately captures the cynical and sarcastic attitude of her main character. I was surprised at how well an adult could get into a teen frame of mind.    I found myself reminiscing on my highschool days, right down to making up names for the teachers and the cliques in the lunchroom.    My only complaint is the length of the story. I was sad that I got through it so fast. It was too good to put down for more than a few hours.    I recommend this book to anyone.	2005-07-18

My problem is that this book reads too much like an adult trying to sound like a teen. The main character seems all too stereotypical and her choice of words just doesn't sound like anyone I have heard... too contrived and forced. The characters just aren't believeable. Another thing I noticed is the typical scenario of teen-girl-track-star-with-an-overworking mother. I have no idea why, but I can think of 3 different books, aside from this one, where the main character runs track and has a mother who works too much. Is this the formula for YA fiction??    This may be a good book but I can't get past the overproduction.	2005-07-16

I found myself relating very much to the main character (Veronika) as she struggles with the pressures to conform. Being a teenager is not the only period of adjustment that people go through. I find being in my early 20's to be almost as confusing. <br /> <br />This book also gives an interesting perspective on mental institutions that I had not considered before. For example, no behavior dispalyed inside an institution is considered unusual or crazy because it is assumed that everyone is crazy anyhow. There is stability in scheduling and no need to get dressed up for work. I never viewed being institutionalized as a positive thing but this book almost makes it seem like an odd vacation. <br /> <br />Ultimately this story is about coming to face death. Witnessing Veronika living her supposed last week of life brings a sense of urgency by which the other patients question their own lives. What have they given up? What do they hope for? What is keeping them from living the way they desire? <br /> <br />This is a wonderful moralistic story and I strongly recommend it to anyone experiencing a quarter-life crisis.	2005-05-01

It has a very poetic feel to it. The author also does a believable job of breathing life into his characters. And his descriptions of the town, the streets, the weather bring the reader right down to earth. <br /> <br />I wish this story had made sense to me. I was rather confused throughout, and often forgot who was doing what and when... new characters are introduced sporatically and this disrupts the plot. Maybe this was the author's intention? <br /> <br />I would recommend this book if you can't find anything else to read.	2005-03-21

I can't remember the last time I looked forward to reading a book as much as I did this one. Gracelin O'Malley is a stunning character who faces life's tragedies with magnificent courage and she leaves those who have met her astounded time and time again.     Once again Ann Moore shows her brilliance. I was worried that this final book in the Gracelin O'Malley trilogy would not give justice to the story that unfolded in the first two books.    The only problem I had with this book was that the story did not pick up where 'Leaving Ireland' ended. Grace has traveled across America and has been living with her son, Jack, for two years now. I would have liked to read about their journey and about Grace's reunion with her son. However this was only a minor dissapointment.    Once again I found myself completely immersed in the story of Grace, of her brother Sean, and all the other beautifully developed characters, new and old. Mrs. Moore does an incredible job of creating emotion and really bringing a story to life. I could easily picture all the events that took place.     I will not give away any of the plot except to say that there is a happy ending. Thank god. If ever a woman deserved happiness, it is Gracelin O'Malley.    I highly recommend 'Gracelin O'Malley', 'Leaving Ireland', and 'Till Morning Light'.	2005-02-20

I found the main character, Alice, very believeable.    Alice is a witty and brave young woman who narrates her own journey into schizophrenia. Her thoughts are strikingly honest and often hilarious.    The best part about this book is its originality. For the first half of the book, Alice compares her psychotic break to the adventures of Alice in Wonderland. I found this comparison extremely interesting and well stated. I also found it to be very informative, by explaining mental illness from the affected person's point of view rather than from the view of researcher, therapist, parent, psychiatrist, etc.    Alice endures a tremendous amount of loss, mainly her ability to differentiate fantasy from reality. She considers suicide multiple times, but does not actually attempt it. Some small thing gives her just enough reason to get through another day, even when the future looks worse than the present.    Alice eventually decides to seek help and although she does not fully recover, she is able to come to terms with her illness. There were certainly some heart-warming moments amidst all the chaos.    I enjoyed all of this story and was never bored. I highly recommend it.	2005-02-13

Set in Ireland during the 1840's, this is a story of survival.    Gracelin is sent off to marry her landlord at the age of 16. Two years later she has birthed three children and buried two of them. All the while she is held captive from her family and physically abused by her husband.    Meanwhile her true love is beginning an uprising of the Irish against the English. No longer are Irish farmers willing to starve while the very crops they raise are shipped to foreign lands.    I will not tell anymore of what happens. This story is full of real-life drama. Gracelin is at once lovable. She courageously puts her own desires aside time and time again, in the hopes of making someone else's life a bit easier. Mrs. Moore does a splendid job of developing the characters and their stories, leading the reader deep into their lives.    I began reading 'Leaving Ireland' the day after I finished 'Gracelin O'Malley'. I just couldn't wait to find out what happenend next in this young woman's tragic life. I am looking forward to reading 'Till Morning Light' which is the last of the 'Gracelin' trilogy.    I recommend this book to anyone.	2005-02-12

And I am counting 1, counting 2.... and this book still makes no sense.    The only credit I can give to this author is his style. It is unique. It is scattered and oddly descriptive.     I read this book in one night, hoping that, at some point, the story would make sense. It never did.    The characters are hardly more than mouthpieces for Mr. Palahniuk's opinions. I found none of them to be particularly believeable or interesting.    The author seems more interested in colors than plot. He spends more words describing the color of a dress than of the characters' thoughts, feelings, actions, etc. The writing changes from narration to dialogue, often switching points of view within the same paragraph. This shreds any sense of cohesiveness the story might have had. This reads more like a journal than a novel.    In my opinion, this book is nothing more than a creative soapbox on which Mr. Palahniuk reveals that he does not like loud music, television, or noisy neighbors. Referring to Orwell's 'Big Brother' as the media.    I do not intend to read anymore of Chuck Palahniuk.	2005-01-30

There is something about her writing style that makes her characters and their stories very real and intriguing. <br /> <br />The plot is not spectacular, and is predictable.

Although the setting is late 1800's in the slums of London, this story could have taken place in any poor town, anywhere in the world.    Fiona (the main character) bears tragedy after tragedy. Orphaned at the age of 17 Fiona is left with her younger brother who is just a toddler. At this point she has also lost the love of her life, Joe, her best friend from childhood whom she had hoped to marry. Just when things seem to be getting worse, Fiona escapes to New York hoping to make a new life there. What she finds is a drunk uncle who is of no help. Again Fiona is left to her own devices.     Joe and Fiona's lives seem to parallel even though they are on separate continents. Both attempt to marry into wealth and both successfully create and manage their own business, neither knowing how the other is doing. They also suffer continually from an intense longing for one another. A desire buried underneath a decade of separation.     So many times Joe and Fiona miss each other by a moment. This left me feeling hopelessly sorry for Fiona and Joe. All they ever wanted was each other and yet obstacle after obstacle prevents them from ever getting the chance to reconcile.    Fiona herself is what drew me in to this story. She takes on more than any human should have to and she perseveres. Dissapointment and loss are commonplace in Fiona's life. However she only briefly considers giving up. I wanted so badly for Fiona to find her happiness, to realize her dreams. I found myself captivated by her struggles, triumphs, her attitude, her sheer determination, and abounding love.    This story is quite heavy in the sense that it evokes many feeling from the reader. One can't help but sympathize for Fiona, seeing as life has been most unkind to her. I recommend this book to any and everyone!!	2005-01-06

I really enjoyed this story as it is different from any I have read. On the surface it is about one family, many generations of women all born in March and all possesing a special ability which they discover on their 13th birthday. <br /> <br />The book goes on to tell how the Sparrow family women basically founded the town in which they lived. The locals however were fearful of the womens' 'talents' and even went so far as to drown the earliest recorded member, believing she was a witch. <br /> <br />As the book goes on, I realized this story is about love, about judging people wrongly, about not questioning your decisions until it's too late. About living with hurt, fear, and regret. It's also about forgiveness and finding that love can heal old wounds... in fact it can do a lot and change people forever. <br /> <br />This book is written very well and reads smoothly. I would recommend it to anyone.	2004-12-23

Although the story is typical... dorky-boy-makes-pretty-girl-fall-for-him-by-being-persistent... it is not boring. Though the plot is predictable, the writing is fun and the author captures the attitudes of the characters very precisely. <br /> <br />I liked this book because I could relate to Remy, the main character, who has all but given up on finding true and lasting love. Remy is cynical having seen her mother marry 5 different men. I like Remy's no-nonsense attitude although some would say she is a b*tch. <br /> <br />As for cheesy teenage love stories,( have only read this one), I would say it is a good book.

Though the novel is graphic, it is done to describe the stories of people who self-injure as told by those people.    My problem with this author and this book is that self-injury is glorified throughout. The book repeatedly uses quotes such as, \\"cutting was my only relief\\", \\"cutting was the only thing to calm me down\\", \\"seeing the blood let me know I was alive\\", \\"cutting was my mother and father\\", \\"cutting was the only way to stay sane\\"... and on and on. In this fashion the author only explains 'cutting' as the ultimate relief. As if it were, in fact, the only option. Not only that, the author writes in such a way that self-injury seems almost sensible... it can be done anytime anyplace at little to no financial cost. Certainly cheaper and more accessible than long term therapy, and apparently more effective.    The author fails to mention what self-injury costs in terms of hospital bills, rising insurance costs, and the anguish caused to others from witnessing someone rip their own skin apart. The author seems to accept that cutting is indeed quite natural for persons who were abused or neglected during childhood. Often the author points to 'cutters' suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This raises the question of why not then are veterans of war and other trauma victims shoving razors and knives into themselves? The author does not address this.    I agree that childhood trauma may cause numerous problems throughout a victim's life. Especially in the area of interpersonal relationships. Certainly a person whose father raped them while their mother stood by, or was abused herself, would have trust issues.    I do not however agree that cutting is as soothing and therapuetic as the author would have the reader believe.    Another MAJOR problem I have with this book is that the author often describes specific techniques people useto hurt themselves. Examples including where to hide razors, how to cut, where to cut, how to cut in a hospital, etc are rampant. I can see no reason at all for this information. Unless this is a how- to guide for self-injury. I think the author blatantly disregards the fact that this book provides many innovative ideas of how to harm. I had never thought of some of the methods described and I can only assume that someone who is trying to find a new way to 'cut' would relish this information. Again, the author presents this in a way that seems completely rational.     I understand that much of the stories are told to explain 'cutting' from the 'cutter's' point of view. This was accomplished in the first two chapters. Needlessly the stories continue throughout the book... seemingly with no other purpose than to evoke shock and sympathy from the reader.    The first 100 pages of this book could be deleted and it would still be useful.     Finally, in the later chapters, the author talks about treatment and how to move away from self-injury. I found this part of the book very practical and insightful.    Overall this could be a good book. I would not recommend it to anyone trying to recover from self-injury. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic or anyone who works with self-injurers.	2004-12-07

The relationship between the two sisters is unshakable, even during the most trying times. <br /> <br />This book is about love and the ways it changes us or makes us look at things differently. Even about the seemingly stupid and regretful things we will do in the name of love. It also explores family dynamics and how any member(s) of the family unit can affect the entire system with even a simple decision. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone.	2004-12-01

The reading was a bit slow at first but by about page 80 I could not put this book down. It is hard to describe just what this story is about, there are many elements.

I have often wondered why women seem to dislike each other so much. Many a female friend has told me \\"I just don't like women...all my friends are guys\\".    This book explains the various ways in which girls (the book focuses on teens) use relationships for manipulation and even punishment. The strive to be popular and conform to society's 'good girl' ideal often drive girls to more subtle and covert forms of bullying.    I agree with the author that acts of aggression beyond physical assault must be dealt with at some level. Especially after reading about how grown women still remembered losing friends or being outcast in highschool, years after the fact. I think it is highly important that teachers, parents, and peers work with and for young women. Relationships are not always easy ,for anyone, and at a time when they can make or break you, it is certainly worth taking a deeper look into the dynamics of girls relationships with other girls.    This is a highly useful and informative book for anyone.	2004-11-27
US	28239390	R2G6HJQZLI61ZJ	0375414819	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Excellent	This book is an compelling tale of poverty in India during the mid 1970's. <br /> <br />This is a long read, but not boring. There is enough detail to keep track of the story and there is no overload on unnecessary information. <br /> <br />The characters are easy to like or hate and the lives are as incredible or mundane as anyone you may pass on the street. <br /> <br />One thing I did not realize until finishing this book is that many of the events that take place are true, such as the prime minister being murdered by her body guards. This only adds to the richness of the story... knowing that many of the hardships likely happened to millions of people. <br /> <br />A sad story, but there are many moments of small joys. It is amazing that some people can find hope in such miserable conditions. This is a wonderful novel and I recommend it to anyone, especially those who may assume that all homeless persons are just lazy.	2004-11-20
US	28239390	R9J0ER1VACFFY	0060589272	571626403	Eleven Minutes: A Novel	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Great read	This was my first book by Paulo Coelho. A friend let me borrow his copy and so I really had no expectations. <br /> <br />Mr. Coelho's writing, in this book, moves along very smoothly and I never once was bored. <br /> <br />The story is not about a prostitue, though that is what the main character does for a living. The story is about making choices, about searching for love and refusing to search for love. This story is about taking risks, some calculated, some spontaneous. <br /> <br />In the end love does indeed conquer all reason because it is the only reason. Why run away from love just because it hurts sometimes. The pleasure is worth the pain.  <br /> <br />At the end of this book I felt very encouraged and happy. Yes, there was a happy ending, though the plot was not exactly predictable. Either way it was a very good book and I recommend it to anyone.	2004-11-14

I am about 100 pages into it and even though I know the outcome, it is no less intense. The characters are so beautifully drawn,I could not help but feel empathy for them. This book pulled all kinds of emotion out of me. I actually felt like a had a relationship with the characters.     The story is told from the various points of view of all the main characters. Without giving too much away... this story is about tough decisions, about how significantly a simple choice can affect others, about how a family can tear each other apart or bring each other together, it is about two young girls who have to make decisions that involve life and death...something that teenage girls should not have to think about.    I found the mother (Sara) detestable through the first parts of the book. She simply chooses to focus her entire life on the state of her daughter (Kate) who is dying from leukemia. Sara decides to genetically engineer and give birth to a second daughter (Anna) for the simple purpose of donating Anna's parts to Kate. Anna realizes and it is made clear to her by Sara that her only purpose in life, and for life, is to keep Kate alive.    I do not know how I would act as a parent or sibling in this situation, thus I can't really speak against or for the decisions that are made. I do think Sara could have at least made an effort to show that she loves all 3 of her children and not just the sick one.    The end of this book was truly heartbreaking, but in a good way. I cried more than I expected to.     If you enjoy books that bring you right into others' lives then this is a good one. I like that the author allows the reader to both witness events from the outside, as well as from the point of view of the characters themselves, 'hearing' the inner dialogue as well as outer.     This is an incredible, well-written novel. I highly recommend it to anyone.	2004-11-03

I found this book to be highly informative and interesting. I am very uneducated regarding the cold war and I know little about the history of any countries besides the United States.    This book paints a distinct and painful picture of life on the run.     What I never realized was just how many refugees there are. All over the world people are forced to give up everything they know, everything they have worked for, everything they have grown accustomed to. That is unless all of there possessions are destroyed before they can willingly leaving them behind.    This book shows how any major change in thinking or political structure can affect millions and millions of people.    I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in human beings.	2004-11-03
US	28239390	R1KWOTHFGYND6I	038572179X	977000479	Atonement: A Novel	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Stirring	This is the best book I have read in a long time. The author does a masterful job of evidencing both the good and bad of the human spirit. The story and characters demonstrate just how faint the line is between innocence and guilt, between love and hate, between ambition and regret. Sometimes an overzealous helper can actually hurt and sometimes nothing can be said to mend old wounds. <br /> <br />Some things cannot be forgiven. <br /> <br />This story often recalls the same events from 3 or more perspectives, thus showing how a single action or statement can be interpreted in as many ways as there are people to witness it. <br /> <br />One good-intentioned act, erodes and destroys the bond between sisters, between family. After years of shame, hatred, guilt, confusion, sorrow... two sisters are reunited only to realize that old feelings still remain and that forgiveness is not possible. <br /> <br />The last 18 pages of the book, find the narrator at her 77th birthday, more than 60 years after her 'crime'. I cried from the beginning to end of this last section of the book. There were no happy resolutions, a young girl, now old woman. A life stolen away by one mistake. The loss is tremendous. <br /> <br />This book seemed tedious at first, but as the story unfolds, each detail comes to tell another part, or leads to another twist. The plot seems predictable at certain points, but this is part of the author's genius... leading the reader towards one outcome then revealing one completely unpredictable. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any human.	2004-09-18
US	28239390	R1L9ZVYVV25MNU	0743246349	674767143	Heaven Lake: A Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Pleasantly Surprised	This book had a very different pace and plot than I typically enjoy. It starts with a young man (Vincent) setting off to do missionary work in China. I was fearful that this book would turn into some bible-thumping, god-fearing novel about Jesus. It does nothing of the sort.    In fact, the majority of the story, and the turning events all point towards Vincent's wavering faith, his changing beliefs, and his blossoming cynicism.    What I liked most about this book is that I could relate so well to the main character, Vincent. The author does an excellent job to present Vincent's intra- as well as interpersonal relationships in a style that is neither distracting or confusing. This writing allows for many stories to unfold simultaneously... Vincent's relationship with himself and the various others whom he purposefully or haphazardly encounters.    Though Vincent borders again and again on hopelessness and disbelief there seems to always come a small yet significant event or thought providing him just enough glimmer of hope to carry on. The plot and characters do well to exemplify the mysteriousness of life. The fact that things are rarely black and white. Life is not always what we think it is, what we want it to be, or what we expect it to be. Life is indeed full of surprises...some good some not so good.     What I grasped as a message from this book: no matter how crappy life can be, the good times, the pleasant surprises, the startling beauties are worth it.	2004-09-11
US	28239390	ROBQFNAP910RH	0753806738	652584984	Through a Glass, Darkly	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Lovely	The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that this book was so short. I actually made myself stop reading the first night I got it because I did not want it to end so fast.     I think that the author could have written much more with the plot... a girl talking to an angel about heaven, an angel asking a girl about life on earth...there is a lot of room for discussion. The ending was very abrupt. Even so, Mr. Gaarder shares some lovely ideas through the words of Cecilia (the main character). This book had a few moments that reminded me of Sophie's World, something totally bizarre that made me literally stop, and think. I love Mr. Gaarder's style, it is almost magical.    My only regret is that I read this book in just 2 nights, but I am certain I will read it again. I highly recommend it!!	2004-09-03
US	28239390	R1OEKAUOOAW5BE	0590319906	804942061	When She Was Good	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Stark	I read this book in just a few hours. The main character (Em) just grabbed me and I couldn't help but keep reading. The book is written in a rather spontaneous way, bouncing between Em's inner thoughts, dialogue, and narration. Though a bit hard to follow, at times, this writing style allows the reader to really feel for Em.    This book is depressing and sad right from the first page. I found myself actually hoping the main character would give up. It was almost painful to read about Em's endless string of dissapointments. Day after day Em goes through the same routine. Where she finds hope is a mystery, but she finds it and she holds onto it.    What I like about this book is the 'realness' of it. Em is a believeable and pitiful character. Her situations are as likely as the sun rising. This is the story of someone who never had anything and never really finds anything. Again, I was almost hoping to read about how Em gave up or was killed or killed herself or was somehow taken out of her miserable life. But Em just keeps on living, her reasons known only to her.    I would certainly recommend this book, it is gripping. But be warned that this is not a happy story, not at the beginning and not at the end.	2004-09-03
US	28239390	R1TOXQ6A2SYEMB	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Captivating!!	I read this book in just 3 nights. I love a book that grabs me right from the first page, and this is one of those books. The language is realistic and age appropriate for the characters. The author also does well to express the emotions of the characters.    The story is narrated, from heaven, by a girl (Susie) who was murdered. I like that the story shows how profoundly an unexpected death can affect those close to the one who died. Susie's unsolved murder ravages and rips apart her family. Each member sinking into their own world, their own way(s) of grieving. At the same time the family, both literally and figuratively, separates from each other, they are simultaneously bound by their unspoken heartache.    The characters are strong in their own unique ways, and even as life is falling apart, they find a way to deal with it...sometimes without thinking.    I felt sad, happy, confused, angry, sympathetic, frustrated, hopeful, and disgusted, all at different points in the story. I even shed a few tears, which speaks to the power of the author's ability to bring words to life. To create a fictitious story that could just as easily be non-fiction.    I found myself actually excited to get home and finish this book. It is not one that I could put down and come back to. If I didn't have to work, I would have read this book all at once.	2004-09-03
US	28239390	R331I6Z8PONRH6	0743245121	825645924	The State Boys Rebellion	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Frightening	I finished this book in just 3 nights. It is a compelling story of the lives of boys/men who endured their childhood in a state 'school for the feebleminded' in Massachusettes during the 1950's. This is a true story, and it reveals just another failed attempt by government to 'protect' Americans. The idea that sterilizing mentally ill persons (based on IQ scores) would rid America of bad genes and therefore create a more competent society, was widely supported both publicly and politically.    Keep in mind that the Eugenics movement in America took place before the Nazi party in Germany had any ideas of racial cleansing. In fact, American scientists who promoted Eugenics were praised by Nazi Germany and asked to speak on the subject of creating a better human.    The author gives enough detail for the reader to form a vague picture of institutional life, without including such graphic recollections that the reader is turned away. More importantly, the author focuses throughout the book on the mental anguish sustained by and the lack of proper education provided to the State Boys (meaning they were wards of the state) as the cause of numerous problems finding work and maintaining relationships during their adult lives.    At the end of this book, I was left feeling disgusted: at how these boys and thousands of others were treated ,     angry: that the government promoted, funded, and attempted to hide the routine warehousing of children and adults into institutions that were understaffed and rampant with abuse of patients,     and ashamed: that Americans have the audacity to point fingers at terrorists and social ills among other nations, when for hundreds of years we have degraded, terrorized, humiliated, enslaved, and ignored our very own citizens.     The fact that few, will ever hear about these kinds of stories is even more disturbing. Even in the 50's government worked hard to cover-up and conceal unethical and controversial experiments, such as radiation testing performed on 1,000s of WWII veterans as well as numerous experiments performed on individuals who lived in state institutions (most of these were performed without informed consent).    American history is not all about courageous war heros and freedom. There have been many, many shameful and cruel acts of violence performed on Americans by Americans. What is frightening is that, looking back at what is now seen as cruel and absurd, was largely publicly supported at the time.....     Hmm, perhaps we (American citizens) should question what we are told rather than taking everything a President or government agency tells us as the whole truth.	2004-08-22

This was required reading for a college course I took. The history contained here is not what is taught in highschool and I was surprised at just how much I did not know about life in America before I was born.    America has a very ugly past and present in many ways. We have oppressed, demoralized, institutionalized, degraded, segregated, stereotyped, and persecuted millions of persons over the years. What is unfortunate is that with all our advances in business and technology... there are still single mothers living on the streets, starving with their children. There are still foreign workers being payed much less than minimum wage. There are still persons living with mental illness being drugged and institutionalized. The rich are still getting richer, as they exploit the poor and working classes.    America has much to be proud of. America also has much to be ashamed of. This book sheds light on some of the crimes that we (America) has committed against its own people, as we continue to point fingers at others wrongs.	2004-08-06

Mr. Yalom is well known for his limitless wisdom and research regarding group therapy. This book is very witty and entertaining. What I like most is that the author reveals some of his inner dialogue when working with clients. This is very revealing and refreshing; to know that even therapists have issues and, as any good therapist knows, regularly receive psychotherapy themselves. I would recommend this book to anyone. I don't recall there being any 'psychobabble' or terms that are used exclusively by therapists. Mr. Yalom very simply presents the lives of some very complex people.	2004-07-29

The list of positive adjectives for this book could go on and on. I was a bit hesitant to buy this book, based on some of the reviews here on Amazon, so I decided to check it out from a local library, I am so glad I did!! I have read all three Conversation With God: An Uncommon Dialogue books and did not think that anything could expound upon the wisdom contained there.     However, 'Tomorrow's God' is truly revolutionary, even in comparison to other CWG books. This book is packed-full of ideas for a brighter future, when the world embraces Life, Love, and God....words that this book explains are interchangeable. I cannot express how exciting it is to imagine a world that this book says will indeed come about. This may seem far-fetched given the current state of the world. It is not hard to imagine though after reading the practical, workable, affordable ideas, insights, suggestions given. From new politics to education to societies across the world. The author has spoke of these things before, but never with such clarity or encouragement.     This book has given me a renewed hope and belief in the goodness of humans and the power of creative thinking. Thanks again Neale!!	2004-07-25

This is one of those books that I wish would go on and on. Marianne's writing style is very to-the-point and she presents her ideas in a very practical manner, using personal life experiences and observations to illusrate her message. What I love most about this book is the explanation of the 'ego' as the root of all our problems. Marianne explains how the selfish and separate ego beliefs lead away from love and unity, towards self-destruction and darkness. The book has a very encouraging and motivating feel to it and the author offers various short prayers that the reader may use. I was also surprised that a paragraph from this book has been wrongly attributed to Nelson Mandela.... the quote about 'what we fear most is not that we are weak, but that we are powerful beyond belief...' those are Marianne's words.    I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone looking for practical ways to deal with life. Marianne's style has a conversational quality to it... I never got the idea that she is claiming to be an expert or bragging in any way (like some authors do). She simply explains what works for her and what she believes can work for everyone.	2004-07-21

Over and over and over and over and over again the author claims that through his program 'Brain Respiration' one may become truly enlightened. His message is encouraging and I like that he says enlightenment is nothing if it doesn't help somebody else. However... this book is simply laced with too many references to his 'Brain Respiration'. If I wanted to read a book on Brain Respiration I would have bought it. Now I won't thanks to this author's rampant self-promotion. This book seems to be merely a lengthy advertisement.	2004-07-21

The author essentially informs the reader that his/her lack of proper and appropriate parenting is the root of any and all of is/her adult troubles. The other thing that I dislike is the author's arrogance. At one point he even says that according to his definition he is practicing psychotherapy all the time and therefore feels it ok to bend and break ethical guidelines. Professionals are supposed to follow a code of ethics...that is what separates professions from other jobs. Another annoyance is the author's apparent need to show off his extensive vocabulary. Yeah, that's great that you went to school for 8 years but who gives a f*ck if you know words that are not commonly used.     Having said that...The latter parts of this book are amazing!! I especially like the ending dealing with the subject of grace. The author presents practical knowledge, with examples, of how grace can work in everyday living. I also enjoyed the section on love, in which the author points to the illusion of romantic love and explains how 'falling in love' is nothing more than a fantasy that inevitably fades away. The structure of the book is perfect, an English professor would love it. Mr. Peck states and supports his opinions very clearly and for the most part, he presents opposing points of view as well.    If you can get past the wordiness and the first 90 pages, then you will find some very useful and encouraging information.	2004-07-13

It's funny how often I have haphazardly came across books that end up being truly incredible to me. <BR>This book takes place in Africa... a land and people that I know very little about. This book gave me a good deal of insight and was very interesting. At some points it was a bit hard for me to keep up as the timeline in the story is not a straight line. What I enjoyed most about this book is a fascinating look at some African beliefs and cultural practices regarding spirituality. <BR>This book does not contain any fairy-tale ending however it does contain some strong messages. The main character deals with all sorts of issues both external and internal. The latter half of this book describes the invasion by christian missionaries and how they essentially destroyed a once vibrant and unique culture. A good read for anyone who wants to explore other cultures/beliefs.	2004-06-21

Having no idea what to expect I figured 'why not?'. Once I started this incredible book I only became more amazed with each page. This one book laid the foundation for my current spiritual beliefs and started me on the quest for more/different spiritual perspectives. This book refers often to the Bible but not in a traditional way. Mr. Butterworth essentially says that Jesus was simply a living testament to the power within us all. Jesus and other 'masters' were no better than anyone else, they simply expressed the highest and truest 'self'. I love this book also because it is very practical. Each idea that is presented is given examples of how to apply the principle in everyday life. My favorite chapter is entitled 'Your thought is your life'. There is also an excellent chapter on prayer. I keep this book in my car, so that whenever I need a good read it is right there. This book truly changed my life 'god is nowhere'.	2004-06-21

It is indeed a history of philosophy but is revealed through the interactions of Sophie and her mysterious 'teacher'. There seems to be 3 stories going on at once throughout the book, which keeps it interesting. There is a twist near the end that totally blew me away. The ending was a bit 'out there' for me but overall I loved every bit of this book and plan to read it again. Anyone who has an interest in philosophy, human history, or just interesting stories will like this book. I also enjoyed this book because the characters are not American and the story does not take place in America. New perspectives are always a good thing for me, and Sophie's World is a marvelous window to see the world through.	2004-06-16

I was so sad that this trilogy had to end. Although many concepts, ideas, suggestions are repeated over and over it is written in such a way that I felt like I was sitting right next to the author. This book is so very intimate and I felt as if I too was having a conversation with god.     As with the other 2 CWG books, this is filled with practical solutions to any and every issue affecting our planet...from war to environment to personal relationships. What I have enjoyed most about the CWG series is the freedom. Never did I get the impression that the author was trying to shove information down my throat or threaten me with eternal damnation if I didn't agree with what he said.     In fact, Mr. Walsch states clearly that he hopes the reader does not take the information in his books as the literal and only truth. Furthermore, he provides a list of other books...by other authors!! This book is not for the religious zealots who intend to 'spread' the word by throwing it at people.     If you have an open mind and, more importantly, an observant mind then you will find this and the other 2 CWG books highly useful. I have never read anything regarding spirituality and life that made as much sense to me as the Conversations With God trilogy. Thank you Neale!!	2004-06-16

Book 1 is obviously what hooked me. I must warn any hardcore religious fanatics that this book is NOT RELIGIOUS. The subject matter here is life and the entire book reads as a conversation with god (hence the name). I love this book mainly because it offers practical advice and knowledge for dealing with questions that philosophers can only guess at... how does the universe work? Is there heaven and hell? why is there 'evil'? ..... and on and on. If your mind is open enough and your beliefs flexible enough then this book and the 2 others in the series offer very practical and real insight into the past, present, and future of the human race...although the books also reveal that time is an illusion. So if you are ready to question everything you have learned, then start here!!	2004-06-16
