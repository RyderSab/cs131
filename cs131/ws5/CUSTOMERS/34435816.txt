BUT FANTASTIC!!!	I have to warn you that the sixth book contains the darkest secrets and actions of all Harry Potter books so far. Jo Rowling continue with her pheomonon Harry Potter series with a new twist, where I expect the same cycle in the story to repeat: Harry battling his way away from the Dursleys; returning to the Order of the Phoenix; returning to Hogwarts with some problems on the way; Qudditch incident, always, and Malfoy confrontations. Only the truth about this book is, some those happened. Jo has twisted the whole novel around and actually gave me the feeling that I am reading a different book that just have a character named Harry Potter who happens to be a wizard. The reason this is, is because, I think, Harry Potter and his friends (Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, etc.) have matured so much since the incident in the Department of Mysteries.<br /><br />Since the news of Voldemort being at large once again, the Wizarding communities have taken full alert at once. Since there have already been mysterious deaths and disappearance, the novel starts out with a different speed, location, and simply, style; and i have to say that the style of the book, is positive. During the course of the book, the most important point is that Harry is to learn more about Voldemort's young self, Tom Riddle. While his learning this, he discovered a mysterious thing (won't spoil that for you =]) that belong to someone who claims to be, \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" (let's say the name was written onto the object) who helped him in a way. Also, a new teacher arrives to take take up an unexpected post by Dumbledore's request. While darkness curtains our world (yes, the muggle world too, since that's the same place), young loves are spouting everywhere, and Mrs. Weasley said that dark times brings people together, knowing that something might happened to them.<br /><br />In this book, the old characters return, though some did not (minor characters, not major, so don't worry!), and don't know why, maybe Jo don't think they are needed in this particular novel. More new characters are introduced, but none as lucky as Luna Lovegood, who became Harry and his friend's close friends.<br /><br />You are warned! The ending of the novel is very unexpected and yes, it leaves my eyes all puffy-red (though, not in a Lord Voldemort way, thank God) and I have cried even harder when Sirius died, who happened to be my first-fave character; therefore, this book is dark. But it is really worth reading because Harry discovers new things and things are going on in a new sort of way, and any Harry Potter fans, cannot miss.<br /><br />Buy it or not? I just gotta say that I can't wait to get my hands onto the SEVENTH BOOK! Wonder when it comes out, seriously. And hope it doesn't have me end it tears, cuz I still can't breathe properly since I read the last page from Chapter 28 to the end of the book; and it is LONG. So imagine that. Oh and did i tell you I still feel miserable and my eyes are filled with tears? Don't worry if you are scared to read it, things can't get anything worst. I hope.they are needed in this particular novel. More new characters are introduced, but none as lucky as Luna Lovegood, who became Harry and his friend's close friends.     You are warned! The ending of the novel is very unexpected and yes, it leaves my eyes all puffy-red (though, not in a Lord Voldemort way, thank God) and I have cried even harder when Sirius died, who happened to be my first-fave character; therefore, this book is dark.

I forgot, my mom threw away my old calendars without asking me, which I am still furious about. Anyway, so I have been collecting HP calendars, but then this year make me quit. The pictures on this calendar are not pretty or good, or anything that's nice. The pictures in here is set to drawn, even though the some of the pics are from the movie, but they edited it. Anyway, after editing it, I think that it looks pretty bad. They kind of make Ron (Rupert) look like a badly drawn clown...which, I am not really happy about. Harry (Daniel) looks okay in here, but then the backgrounds are a bit, blah...well I don't like the werewolf picture, I mean, it is so big, they should have made it smaller, so I don't have to face a werewolf for an entire month. Also, isn't there pictures of dememtors or any of those ugly beasts? I mean, can't they at least make it smaller, but not fill up half of the calendar? I don't want to wake up one morning and the firs thing I see (I look at the calendar to check out the days) is a ugly dementor giving the kiss.<br /><br />Maybe the guys don't mind, because, doesn't guys like weird stuff? I don't know.	2004-12-25

Not that the shirts doesn't look good, because it really looks good on her. Plus, the pictures are pretty good, unlike some other calendar I saw that takes the pictures out of some music video for the caldendar. I can say that she does look good, so if you like Hilary, then you should get this calendar, but if you don't, stay away from it...or if you simpily out of choose, maybe you could get this one.	2004-12-25
US	34435816	R18BPXVLNLTVUK	0060194995	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	4	1	5	N	N	Classical Tale	I have to read this book for school, which we just finished it like last week. I think this book overall is pretty good, but I can't really state my opinion to the book, because I was forced to do vocabularies, answer study questions, and take a test for each chapter of the book (31 Chapters). But if I have time, I might read it again without some forcing me to read something that I wasn't ready for.<br /><br />I recommend this book to the people who is entering high school. I have heard from sophomores, juniors, and seniors that they have to read this book when they were freshmans. So, you little people below high school should get a head start on reading high school gonna-read books. This book's vocab and stuff is not hard at all, but it is like a tradition that every single one of us has to read.<br /><br />This book brought us back to the time in which the Great Depression took place, but the story didn't really link that much to the Great Depression, but it is just a reference point in which we can tell what the setting is. Our young narrator, Jean Louis Finch, who is commonly known as Scout, tells us the important events that happened in her life that leads to her brother Jem's accident. Throughout the story, it shows us, the reader that our main characters is growing and intersting events happened while they grow. Scout started her story at age seven, but the narrator Scout, in my opinion, is a grown-up Scout, and this story is like a flashback, but we'll never know, because the story never told us. That's why this book is a classical tale, because it allows you to think about the what is happening, what makes it happen, and what might happen.<br /><br />I give it a four star because I did enjoy, but not fully, because of my English teacher forcing us to read. Keep in mind, I recommend this to all middle-schoolers!	2004-12-21

I have read \\"The Pearl\\" which is more confusing then this book that I am currently reviewing, anyway, let's get back to this book. Steinbeck tells the story in a confusing way, I may say, but once you get to the main plot points, you will understand where he is leading you. In this book, it is about George and Lennie, who, people would call odd, because no men would travel together anymore, during that time period, which is, 1930's I guess (I forgot). This book shows the bond of friendship and the hardship that grown up has to get over with. It starts out with getting a job at a ranch, we soon discovered that the tall and strong Lennie has a mind of a child, which makes things worst, once they got their job at the ranch. George, who is Lennie's companion, really wants to keep Lennie out of trouble, but sometimes trouble comes without you knowing it. Soon, after some time, things gets worst, and an surprised ending wraps the story all up.	2004-12-21

People can say that Chris Paolini is following Tolkien's footsteps because Chris' Inheritance trilogy is can say, somehow similar to the LOTR trilogy, because the story is a type of epic (heroic type of story), and it contains a**-kicking wars, urgals, elves (no Orlando Bloom though lol), dwarfs, power-hungry empire (in LOTR's case, a darkness that want to gain country of Middle Earth) that wants to take control of Alageasia, the place where the story takes place, but there are no hobbits, for that would be copying. Anyway, Chris started writing this novel when he graduated high school at fifteen (isn't that amazing???) and started writing the first deubt novel of the Inheritance trilogy. He is currently twenty-one years old. The author of this book is young and talented, and has won my heart...okay I am a nerd!<br /><br />Anyway, let's focus on the story. This story, can be the next Harry Potter multi-millionair series, for the story is so tempting that you can't put the book down when it is time for you to go to sleep or school, or work. And you feel like you have to go and rush to Chris' house and tell him to hurry up on writing the next novel, the Eldest, when you finished reading the book. Anyway, main character and the story: Eragon, as many of you may have guessed, is the main character of the story. This story is basically a fantasy tale of the existance of dragons and riders where they are destinied to bring peace among the elves, dragons, and even human. Eragon, who is only a poor farm boy, discovered a dragon egg and soon went on to a advanture to hunt the Ra'zac, who killed his beloved family member (can't tell ya who, no spoilers), and soon went on the adventure to bring justice upon the evil emporer, Galbatorix, who is, in this case, a bad king, and a trouble-maker for the people that lives in Alageasia. There is also the Varden, who is in this case, the good guy, and the side that Eragon has to join in order for the people to bring peace. Will Eragon join them and defeat the powerful emporer? I don't know either, because is not in the first book, so I guess you and I have to find out.<br /><br />Opinion to the story: This story is better than the Lord of the Rings series, because, Chris doesn't spend so much time descriping flowers, and trees like Tolkien did, which is to my relief. Though the plot was kind of weak at first, because I was tryin to find out what is the point of Eragon traveling to these places, of course I know what he was after, but I thought the point was a bit weak, unlike Harry Potter, for example, book one of the HP series, Harry trying to find out what the heck Snapes up to, and Rowling actually builds up the detail about how Harry wanted to save the Sorcerer's stone, but in Eragon, the point is a bit weak. But then once some tragic happened (someone died okay?), the plot or theme grew stronger, and the destination point that Eragon has to reach became stronger, so I get to follow along what he was up to. Overall, this book is too short in my opinion, and it totally rocks, but of course, Harry Potter would still be my first choose, and it is better than LOTR, so if you like LOTR, and wanted to find something kind of similar, just go ahead and read this book, and if you like Harry Potter, you should try this out too!

The Baudlaries went into a adventure \\"deep in the water\\" finding the object that beholds the secrets of V.F.D., but only found that their luck has not come yet. Did Count Olaf got the object before the Baudlaries and takes over the headquarters or did the mysterious member of the V.F.D. got it first? Oh man, lots of mysteries!!!<br /><br />This series gets more interesting with the author's hillarious sense of humor. That's why Lemony Snicket has become one of the fave authors. Really, you have gotta read this book!<br /><br />Hope the movie is going to be as good as the books, unlike Harry Potter, which is like a disappointment.	2004-11-10

So now after lefting the book in the bookshelve for an year, I finally read the book and thought, \\"Hey this is nothing like Harry Potter!\\" This book is like, completely different from Harry Potter; although Charlie Bone did go to a different school after discovering that he can hear people's thought through pictures. In this book, Charlie goes through advantures discovering mysterious that beholds inside a inventures case, that's remain locked. Charlie and friends finds more clues while he attends to Bloors Academy for the genius'. So this book is basically a different story from any other story that I have read. I don't know know why they always put Harry Potter next to it, but it just doesn't have anything to do with Harry Potter, I mean, the whole theme is different, and Charlie is not a wizard, as far as I know. So I do recommend you guys this book. I rated this book a five star 'cause it is a good book afterall. Though I would say Harry Potter is a better series. But do read Charlie Bones advanture!	2004-07-18
