The book is thoughtful, funny, and extremely well-written.  I especially like the use of the first-person approach as we get into the mind of the lead character, living his life and understanding how difficult it can be to like oneself, tackle sidewalks and curbs, yet someone know that everything will work out.  I won't give away the plot of this book, but I will recommend this book highly.	2003-11-12

But this is also a story of moving on, in learning to accept the sour note that life throws our way and conquering it.  It is filled with hope despite the trouble.  Gal is tough. She is broken at times, but I strongly admire her for moving on, for learning---to some degree--that life is a journey forward. This is admirable. Couple the fact that poverty, hopelessness, racism, and familial adversity are all themes in this book, Gal teaches us a lesson: learn from the past, move toward the positive. It is worth it.	2001-09-15

While waiting to give my bi-weekly status reports to the President I reported to, there were photographic prints of Adams' work on the walls. The clean look to the photos calmed me before my meetings. In picking up &quot;Ansel Adams at 100&quot;, I am reminded of a calm vision of beauty, in both words and pictures. Szarkowski's book is artistic and beautiful. First of all the book is well crafted with high quality pages that yield the most amazing pictures of the Adams collections. Secondly, the photos, especially of Yosemite, show an almost spiritual bent to them. I found myself looking carefully at both the sweeping measures of the photos, the granduer, and suprisingly, the sweet simplicity of a tree, a mountain, a leaf. It is Adams' mastery of focusing on the simple yet at the same time utterly complicated subject that makes you appreciate his clarity. Thirdly, the excerpts of Adams' vision and life lend to the book in giving the reader another overview of this work and life---especially how that led to his interests, his almost driven focus. All in all, it's a beautiful book, richly photographed and written, and elegant in both presentation and subject. Well worth the price.	2001-08-30

This is a very clever and simple story about mice who ultimately find the cheese. But on the metaphor-meter, it's a story about learning to notice change, accepting it, and adapting to change. Why?

While I can see how some people may react to O'Reilly in the sense that he is very frank and speaks his mind, this book was refreshingly charming and open in how it deals with the state of politics, cultural, interpersonal relations, child-rearing and how life in America was once lived.  Basing a lot of his opinions, of course, on his experiences, O'Reilly is precise and to the point. Bing. Bang. Done. It's playful and deadly serious at the same time.

What startles me is that we've been exposed to two years worth of Bushisms during the presidential campaign and we never said anything about it.  And neither did the media, an industry that was oh-so-ready to take Clinton down.  With every passing Bush quote, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief that a man could be so inarticulate, so vague, and so thoughtless and still be selected president. Another fine achievement in &quot;failing upwards.&quot;  The Bush Dyslexicon is a great book written by Mark Miller, an NYU professor who makes it a point that he is writing only FACTS about Bush.  And this is very evident.  Chapter after chapter we are exposed to Bush's inarticulate &quot;thoughts&quot;, his ramblings, his unclarity, and his outstanding achievement of never answering a question.  Campaign trails; debates; newspaper interviews: it's all there. And it's an amazing read, one that impresses the reader with Miller's journalistic writing style and commentary....and begs the question: Why were we not listening and WHY was the media so quiet?	2001-08-07

Very candid, and yet ultimately subtle, too---the book, which is written in the form of a letter, makes one think about the trials that many minorities (primarily African-Americans) go/went through and how far we've come today......and, yet sadly, how much further we have to go.

Historical in perspective, &quot;The Life of Elizabeth I&quot; is also a more personal account of the Queen's loves, her brilliant mind, and, of the loyalty that was afforded to her by her public and her court (for the most part).  In fact, it is this component of this book that makes it so real.  When Ms. Weir, for instance, writes of one account of Elizabeth I riding through a village and how she interacted with her grateful subjects, one gets a more close-up view of a queen so regal and forbidding, yet gracious.  One does not see Elizabeth I as a &quot;person&quot; in her portraits.....but one can in this book.  Filled with stories,  histories, and loves, this is a great book that is sweeping in reach. Well done.	2001-08-01

Tying in movie stars, political agendas, and manipulation, the group strikes quickly and lethally upon those who are in their way.  It takes two good looking movie stars and one insightful lawyer to take them down.  Very well written, great dialogue and a masterful way of layering stories, Kevin O'Brien's work deserves praise. He has found a new fan.	2001-06-16

Walter De Milly's personal story about child abuse, his relationship with his father, and his own way of dealing with it and understanding it, is a great accomplishment in the art of storytelling. The book deals with the loss of innocence, disturbing childhood memories, and the interaction between Walter and his father, both as a child and adult.  One sentence in the book lends dramatic insight into the feelings of the author throughout his ordeal and the aftermath: &quot;The eyes scream what the lips dare not whisper.&quot; One can only imagine how a boy's silence could be ignored when all one had to do was look into his eyes. It is a story well told and strongly felt by any reader.	2001-05-25

The Caretaker shows how even the most elaborate bluff resorts to chaos, manipulation (even by those you'd imagine or appear to be the most unlikely to twist one's life) and death.  Allowing hints to creep into the narrative Simpon produces a story that will keep the reader turning the pages, allowing the mind to carve its own story.  The ending, though mostly not a surprise, will lend the reader to sigh a big &quot;oh, oh&quot;, wishing that the next book by Simpson produces a sequel to The Caretaker.

Some of the words and sentences can philosophically strike the reader: &quot;those who wear the mark have found themselves&quot; or &quot;fate and temperament are two words for one and same concept&quot;.

The book moves quickly, the characters develop even quicker. An easy read, but a thrilling one, Mr. Simpson sure knows how to write.

What is profound is that the title is so ironic, filled with shame, with fate's mysterious ways in parting friends. But the reader will ultimately ask, were the two boys at the heart of the story friends, and why exactly did the narrator's guilt haunt him into old age. A lot is left unsaid in this story, but the images provoked and the symbols suggested lend a simple power to the story that, if allowed, might touch the reader. &quot;So Long, See You Tomorrow&quot; is a book that should be read slowly to enjoy its simplicity, and it should be allowed to impact how the reader views the whole concept of &quot;memory.&quot; For the ultimate question still remains: Is memory and one's past reality or fiction?	2001-01-20

While clearly biased, Mr. Begala manages to write a witty book that will make each reader smirk at Dubya, laugh at his antics and beliefs, and shudder with sheer fear at some of George W.'s views, practices, and &quot;thoughts.&quot; It is a book that should be read at face value, for each fact is clearly footnoted and referenced, thus making it a plausible and frightening read.

The friendships that are bonded, and destroyed (one should hope),  lend the reader to think about the consequences of one's actions, one's beliefs, one's perception, and how reality can play a factor in one's life---once discovered, that is. For this reader the book was read in one night, as it grasped my imagination with its wording and how it grabbed hold of my attention to find and resolve the main conflict of the story: experimentation and perception. A masterful storyteller and written in the true mode of a psychological thriller, Mr. Banks has a true winner with this book. The last paragraph will truly make the reader gasp.	2000-11-26

Ackerley, lends insight into the minds of two men, both curious and proud, both leading secret lives. The book, in reality, is two parallel stories that merge into one. Both stories attribute the same themes: upholding honor to one's family and self-worth; love; past lives; abandonment; and learning to accept truth, even if one is not prone to liking it, or respecting it. I like the way the book, written like a carefully plotted novel, is thoughtful in it's approach to building upon the &quot;history&quot; of both father and son while slowly revealing that both men had secrets. And each secret tells of a son's ultimate forgiveness of a father and a father's loyalty to his families, however way one looks at it. Clever in its approach, witty in its storytelling, My Father and Myself is a good read, one that allows the reader to dwelve into the pysche and lives of two men. The reader will learn something, too, as the book ultimately teaches a story about perception and reality.	2000-09-27

First, one can read this book  simply as an autobiography of one of health care's most successful and  brightest leaders.  The book is designed as a story of Dr. Kovner's resume.  Each chapter is devoted to the eight respective careers that Dr. Kovner has  held, each filled with a detailed description of what it means to be an  administrator, a consultant, an academic, respectively, in various  organizations.  Second, each career proves to be simultaneously easier and  harder than the previous or next one. This is made clear by Dr. Kovner's  ability to lend insight with a welcome but heavy dosage of wit (e.g. a  manager in a difficult situation can best be labeled as &quot;having as  much chance as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest&quot;); advice  (&quot;network, network, network&quot;); and a &quot;lessons learned&quot;  segment within each chapter (&quot;I would encourage any manager to pay  attention to timing and questions of tone.&quot;)  Tying these thoughts  together, and reading in-between the lines, one can read past Dr. Kovner's  clever wit and openess to understand: 1.) That a successful career is one  that is a mixture of skills and experiences where one can be a  &quot;gentleman&quot; who completes his work with passion and merit;  2.)That one needs to fail in some jobs to be ultimately successful in  other, more challenging ones; 3.)That friends and mentors help enhance  one's ego, mind, and temperament; 4.) That every manager needs to keep his  eyes focused, his ears open, and his sense of humor ever present; and 5.)  That it is fun to look back on one's career and be able to tell anecdotes  and managerial tidbits.  Each chapter ends with a checklist of questions  that current and future managers can answer honestly about themselves, all  based on the themes of the chapter. Ever the professor, Dr. Kovner  concludes each chapter with a &quot;Practical Exercise&quot; segment that  allows the reader to ask and look into questions that helps her own career.  With humor, classic academic rigor, and fine storytelling, Dr. Kovner  paints of picture of eight careers that are fun, practical, insightful, and  most importantly extend a lesson.  I highly recommend this book to young  managers who need a mentor and to experienced managers and academics who  can share in the experiences of a fellow leader.  As a young administrator  myself, the next time I want to serve as a consultant, become a CEO, work  with a billion-dollar foundation, or teach graduate school, I think I'll  check back with each respective chapter and see what may come my way in way  of expectations, rewards, lessons, and, of course, work. For this I remain  thankful, as will any reader.	2000-08-22
