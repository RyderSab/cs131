All I am is a person who is fascinated by the history of that great nation and people.  And this book seems to me to be pretty close to essential for anyone who shares that interest.<br />The Emergence of Rus tells of the origins of the Russian people and the first great Russian state at Kiev.  Given that few written sources are available for the time period, this book relies heavily on archaelogical information early on.  Such written sources as exist are compared and contrasted and the conclusions drawn seem eminently reasonable.  Even though there is a lot of archaelogical data presented in the first part of this book, it is by no means dry.  Franklin and Shepard have a interesting story to tell and they tell it very well.  I found The Emergence of Rus to be a very good read, something I'll definitely go back to.<br />If you are interested in Russian history at all, this book is highly recommended.	2001-11-07

Their biases don't get as flagrantly in the way as is sometimes the case with British and American historians. They are less chatty than the British can often be and they are far less inclined to the grand, sweeping statement than the Americans. The best of them observe even French people and events with scientific detachment. <br />This new biography of Calvin could only have been written by a Frenchman and Bernard Cottret does a wonderful job. The Calvin who emerges here is a far more complex figure than the cartoon that other historians have drawn. Far from a firebrand, John Calvin was a remote, shy, almost withdrawn figure who had whatever offices he held forced upon him. Geneva had gone in for Reformed Protestantism long before he arrived there and Calvin's Geneva was far from the &quot;theocracy&quot; it is often caricatured as. <br />Calvin's faults are not papered over; Cottret does not attempt to hide his displeasure at the burning in Geneva of many accused of witchcraft or of the burning of Michael Servetus, for example. But in the case of Servetus which is dealt with extensively here, he points out that Geneva only did what the Roman Church would have done if it had the chance and that Calvin actually cooperated with the Roman Catholic Church in this matter, seeing Rome as less of a threat than certain radical Protestants, rather cutting the ground out from under those who believe Calvin was rabidly anti-Catholic.<br />All in all, Calvin is an outstanding book that I cannot recommend too highly.	2001-07-07

One's opinion of the current Book of Common Prayer is naturally going to be shaped by one's experience with previous editions.  To lay my cards on the table, I grew up on the 1928 edition.  And this version does have two very nice features.  The Psalter here is clear and eminently readable and the liturgy for Compline is great as a private devotion, one that I've used many times.<br />But that's pretty much it.  Now and then, the theology is appalling.  Removing the phrase &quot;miserable offenders&quot; from the confession, for example(we can't call people that;they might feel bad about themselves).  Thee's and thou's are arbitrarily stuck into modern prayers, as if pronoun trouble was all that bothered Episcopal conservatives.  And the whole book is such an inept hash that it will not surprise me if it is substantially revised again very soon.<br />This edition of the Book of Common Prayer is not as egregious a disaster as the current Episcopal hymnal.  But if you would like a great Christian devotional book in the English language, get the 1928 version of this(or the 1662 English version)and see how this sort of thing should be done.	2001-06-08

United States national politics and governance is terribly boring.  The office-holders on this side of the Atlantic are called President, Senator, Congressman, Under-Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs and other dull republican titles.  We don't get to have a High Almoner, a Swan Marker, a Boy Bishop, or any of the other offices the British have accumulated over the centuries.  Not even an Herb Strewer.<br />This book examines the histories of many of Britain's historic offices, both ancient and relatively modern.  The office-holders are beautifully photographed, many in their distinctive dress and regalia.  Many of these stories are fascinating.  I never knew, for example, that the Bishop of Norwich is also legally the Abbot of St. Benet-at-Holme or that anyone visiting the Hospital of St. Cross can still get the Wayfarer's Dole, a piece of bread and a cup of beer, merely by asking for it.<br />Essential for anyone interested in history.

While that is still excellent advice, there is  another writer whose works you would do well to passionately collect.<br />Philip Yancey's goal in this book was a simple one.  He wanted to meet God's Son as He really was, not as this or that theologian or church interpreted Him.  Yancey wanted to walk the paths of Israel with Jesus, to get to know Him, to listen to His words, to see how the people of that time reacted to Him and to wonder how he himself might have reacted to the life and teachings of Jesus.  <br />Yancey succeeds wonderfully.  This book is filled with pithy and profound observations that will have you meditating very hard.  I don't agree with all of his conclusions but I think Yancey has done as good a job of introducing the reader to Jesus Christ as any modern writer I've ever read, certainly far more meaningfully than celebrated religious skeptics, some of them claiming to be Christian, who presume to believe they know what Jesus &quot;really said&quot; or &quot;really meant.&quot;<br />And Yancey is a wonderful writer.  I tend to jump around when I read, now reading this book and now that one, depending on my interests of the moment.  But this book held my undivided attention for two days straight.  I made a point of making time to read this, something I rarely ever do.  <br />Buy this right now.	2001-05-14

Some time ago, I flirted with the idea of Southern nationalism.  The homogenized banality, arid pretentiousness, and outright stupidity of modern American culture, along with that culture's implacable hostility to the Christian religion, seemed to make such a move necessary, even mandatory.  Given the concerns of many so-called neo-Confederates, I can see that I was wasting my time.<br />If you read The South Was Right! then you pretty much know what's here because much the same ground is covered.  The Civil War was a war of aggression(debatable) because the South had every right to secede(At Milledgeville, Georgia in 1860, Alexander Stephens disagreed; see Secession Debated).  Lincoln was a tyrant and a despot, Satan personified(Lincoln was a realist; the Confederate leadership was self-destructedly romantic).  Grant and Sherman would be tried as war criminals if they lived today(probably; but Grant and Sherman figured out long before Lee that the nature of war and the way to fight it had irrevocably changed).  Southerners are routinely portrayed by the media as stupid and uneducated(regrettably true, but that long preceded the war; see Grady McWhiney's Cracker Culture).  And on and on and on.  <br />Southern nationalists like Thornton spend so much time refighting the war that they have little or no time for the South as it is today.  One wonders why an African-American Southron would be anything other than hostile to a new CSA, given that Thornton approvingly includes the New Albany Declaration in an appendix, a statement of Southern nationalist principles that includes articles like these:<br />That the hallowed battledfields and cemeteries of 1861-1865 bear silent witness to the destruction wrought by the United States government in league with Northern financial interests and social radicals for the purpose of subjugating and obliterating the Southern people, to wit: abolition, aggression, conquest, disenfranchisement, reconstruction and amalgamation.<br />That we, as well as all Americans of European descent, are suffering a second, more terrible reconstruction, one that began in the late 1940s with the schism in the Democratic Party over the &quot;Civil Rights&quot; plank, that escalated with the Brown school desegregation decision of 1954, and that achieved dominance with the &quot;Civil Rights&quot; Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965<br />That the assertion of equality among races, sexes and moral belief systems is contradicted by every shred of natural evidence; as a people, we condemn inter-racial unions which are destroying our society and our people's very existence.<br />That we have a long and distinguished martial tradition that precludes soldierly participation by women or other races.<br />I would still be enthusiastic about a Southern nationalism that looked forward not back, that had genuine ideas for the preservation of Southern culture rather than paranoid bumper stickers, and that included ALL Southrons, whatever their race.  R. Gordon Thornton's version is worse than useless.	2001-03-09

The greatest deficiency of Ken Burns' celebrated documentary (enough to make it almost useless)is that he spent almost no time on the causes.  I have always found the political maneuvering between North and South, between the two great parties(and within them as well), the occasions when secession and war almost happened, and the dramatic compromises that held off disaster to be essential for understanding the war and why it was fought the way it was.  The political battles over the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Lecompton Constitution are more interesting to me than the dramas of Antietam, Chancellorsville or Gettysburg.<br />Avery Craven was one of the so-called &quot;revisionist&quot; school of American historians, those academics who asserted that there was blame for the war on both sides, that condemned radical abolitionists and Southern fire-eaters equally.  Although he may not have intended it, Professor Craven makes an even more interesting assertion.  There were not two sides in this affair but three.  The West(what would now be the Middle West)was a region with its own economic interests.  And this region, for the most part, wouldn't have gotten all that worked up about slavery if its farmers could have gotten their goods to market.  But Southern political ineptitude and indifference to Western interests alienated that region from the South and probably cost the South the war.<br />All in all, an excellent history of the antebellum United States. Whether you agree with Professor Craven's ideas or not, this book is well worth your time.	2000-11-29

It wasn't always so. In our revolutionary period, Southerners were just as angry at British offenses in the North as Northerners were, while Northerners cheered South Carolina's victory at Sullivan's Island just as passionately as Southrons did. Virginians like George Washington and Daniel Morgan fought in the North while the greatest general of the Southern theater was the Rhode Islander Nathaniel Greene. <br />Why did Northern and Southern unity quickly become mutual suspicion and eventually dissolve into hostility? Was race the only reason? To Grady McWhiney, the question is largely a cultural one. McWhiney feels that Southern culture was and is Celtic. Most of the original settlers in the North came from England, while most of the South's early settlers came from the most Celtic regions of the British Isles(Ulster, Scotland, Cumberland, the West Country, etc). These settlers put a Celtic stamp on the South, influenced all who settled there, Celt or not, and brought with them their age-old hostility to the English, a hostility that was(and continues to be)reciprocated by the &quot;English&quot; of the North. <br />Celtic influence on Southern culture cannot be seriously disputed. Anyone who has ever heard bluegrass or country music can hear just one aspect of it. And that North and South are still mutually hostile is also unarguable. The uneducated bigot in the movies usually has a Southern accent and prominently displays a Confederate flag. But I think McWhiney oversimplifies. Celtic influence was there, but it was not alone. As Charles Hudson pointed out in The Southeastern Indians, Native American influence on Southern culture(which McWhiney ignores)was considerable, a fact well known to many of us with families from the southeastern US who have unsuccessfully tried to untangle our genealogies.<br />In short, Cracker Culture is worth your time. Just don't stop with it.	2000-11-14

Whether I die Anglican or not is up to God.<br />John Shelby Spong believes that there are millions of people out there exiled from the Christian church.  Seems the church has all these outdated ideas and tenets that are no longer relevant to modern society.  The church tells them that they ought not do certain things, for example, and makes them feel guilty if they do.  And certain church tenets have, according to Spong, been cast aside by modern science.  Unless the church reforms itself along lines suggested by John Shelby Spong, surprisingly enough, it is doomed.<br />Considering that universities used to offer degrees in eugenics, Spong's tenacious faith in science is baffling.  And his megalomania is, as usual, breathtaking in its scope(Spong's biography is titled Here I Stand).  His &quot;scholarship&quot; consists mainly in asserting that anyone who disagrees with him is a bad scholar.  Anyone who holds a Biblical view of Christianity is peremptorily dismissed as a &quot;fundamentalist,&quot; his favorite epithet.  And since he and other Christian liberals have reduced the number of sins down to two, racism(except when directed to African bishops, as Spong did at the last Lambeth Conference)and homophobia, his &quot;god&quot; is as vacuous and useless as the rest of his theology.<br />Should Christianity ever change in the way Spong would like it to, it will deservedly die, since there will be nothing whatsoever to distinguish it from the world around it.  Anyone who disputes that need only look at what's left of Spong's own Episcopal Church.  If you're looking for a god that requires nothing of you and that won't get in your way, John Shelby Spong's got a deity for you.  If you're interested in the God of the Bible, you won't find Him here.	2000-10-31

In the St. Louis area, where I  live, this man would probably have been beaten to within an inch of his  life, but to most Missourians, St. Louis might as well be New York City.   In out-state Missouri, publicly displaying a Confederate flag does not seem  to be an unofficial felony.<br />Why?  Why did a state which began life and  perceived itself as Western become the most Confederate state in America(as  some of us like to point out, WE didn't surrender until 1882, when Frank  James turned himself in after Jesse's murder)?  In this biography of  Claiborne Jackson, the Missouri governor who tried to take his state out of  the Union, Christopher Phillips argues that Missouri's transformation from  Western to Southern basically boiled down to the protection of slavery.   Central Missourians, the people around whom this book mostly revolves, did  not see owning slaves as contrary to democracy but central to it.  Their  families had owned slaves since emigrating to the West from Kentucky or  Virginia. Threats, or perceived threats, to slavery finally drove segments  of Missouri's leadership to a full-fledged Southern identity and led to  Missouri's exceptionally violent civil war, which in turn fueled Missouri's  fierce postwar attachment to the Confederate States.<br />This is both a good  biography of Jackson and a good study of antebellum Missouri.  But I do  have a few problems with it.  Phillips spends the bulk of his time in the  Boon's Lick(now called Little Dixie another result of the war)among the  slaveholding aristocracy there.  Natural, one assumes, because that's where  Jackson was from, but the rest of the state is neglected.  St. Louis is  paid attention to, but other areas of the state, like the fiercely Unionist  regions of the Ozarks, are barely mentioned.  And once the war starts,  Phillips seems in a hurry to wrap things up; I wish he'd spent more time on  the war itself.<br />Nonetheless, if you're interested in antebellum American  history, this book is well worth your time.	2000-09-01

Reading about the day-by  day-successes and failures of great Christians is much more realistic, far  easier to apply in my own walk with God.<br />This is the four-year journal of  George Whitefield, considered one of the co-founders, along with John  Wesley, of the Methodists, outstanding open-air preacher, and one of  Christ's greatest soldiers.  Whitefield's labors for the Lord are a great  encouragement to me, as well as a gentle reminder of how little I myself  do.  And there is a wealth of historical information here as well.

That book, although it contained  much useful and(for the unreconstructed Northerner)embarassing information,  was repetitive, occasionally poorly-argued, and overly polemical.   <br />Adams' book, on the other hand, is a concise lawyer's brief.  He argues  that the South seceded primarily for economic reasons.  Adams puts a number  of disinterested European third parties on the witness stand, notably  Charles Dickens, to buttress his case.  And he demolishes the arguments of  John Stuart Mill, the &quot;prosecution's&quot; star witness and the man  who said the whole thing was about the protection and expansion of  slavery.<br />Although I'm not completely comfortable with Adams'  argument(slavery seems to have been far more important in Southern thinking  than Adams makes it out to be, and with good reason.  Black people were a  reality in the South but an abstraction in the North), it is difficult to  disagree with it entirely.  Slavery, after all, was still legal in the  North and would remain so until 1865.  The North ADDED a slave state during  the conflict(West Virginia)and Mr. Lincoln countermanded TWO emancipation  orders during the war.  Thomas Jefferson was not overly terrified by the  idea of secession.  And Mr Lincoln himself, in 1848, admitted that any  people dissatisfied with their government, had the right to form one that  suits them better.<br />Adams portrayal of Lincoln's actions early in the  war(suspension of habeas corpus, illegally calling out the militia,  shutting down opposition newspapers, arresting the Maryland legislature,  etc.)is devastating.  Although Adams does get off track now and then, When  in the Course of Human Events is highly recommended for anyone interested  in history as it really was.  Devotees of the cult of St. Abraham, though,  may want to avoid it.	2000-08-14

And, contrary to many of the history books, there was brutality, inhumanity, and savagery on both sides.  William  Clarke Quantrill's Lawrence raid was more than matched by the Union Army's  Order #11, the depredations of Doc Jennison and other jawhawkers, the  deliberate execution of Confederate prisoners by Union officers at Palmyra  and St. Louis, and other atrocities.<br />This book is one of the best books  I've ever read on the War for Southern Independence in Missouri.  Its  description of Quantrill's early life is rather speculative, due, one  supposes, to the lack of documentary material. But one really gets a feel  for the Missouri war here, and Leslie does come up with some surprising  information.  For the benefit of those who thought Quantrill's Raiders were  a sort of nascent Klan, Leslie points out(somewhat reluctantly, it seemed  to me)that at least three free blacks rode with Quantrill and one of these  scouted Lawrence prior to the raid.  And his description of the fate of  Quantrill's remains is interesting.  Highly recommended.	2000-03-17

The Greeks were scared to death of it. Aristotle wouldn't permit it(and the Catholic Church's vice-grip on Aristotelianism held Western science and mathematics  back for centuries).  But this force does not discriminate; it delights in  tripping up secular science as well. Certain forms of mathematics must  ignore it in order to work.  String theory basically pretends it isn't  there.  It is, as stated on the book jacket, &quot;a timebomb ticking in  the heart of astrophysics.&quot;<br />Zero.<br />Charles Seife's history of  zero(and of infinity, which is awfully close to the same thing, as Seife  elegantly demonstrates)is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking  books I have read in a long time.  There are mathematical and scientific  equations and concepts aplenty here, but they were not daunting for this  manifestly un-mathematic non-scientist.  Seife has a fascinating story to  tell and he tells it with enthusiasm.  I cannot recommend Zero too highly.	2000-03-12

And this is one of the best reference sources on Africa that I have ever seen.  Maybe even THE best.  Africana is as comprehensive and scholarly a source on African history and culture, from ancient times to  the present and on both sides of the Atlantic, as I guess is possible in  one volume.  And it is a wonderful source of biographical information on  Africans and African-Americans, something reference librarians know can  sometimes be hard to find.  If your library doesn't have this book,  strongly urge them to get it.	2000-02-04

All aspects of the history and theology of the movement are examined respectfully and in great detail and  its more bizarre manifestations are not covered up or ignored.<br />This  book's major drawback is its age.  It desperately needs updating; a great  deal has happened in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity since 1988.   The Trinity Broadcasting Network barely registers here, and such current  Pentecostal and charismatic luminaries as T. D. Jakes, Clarence McClendon,  Benny Hinn, Rod Parsley, and others do not show up at all.  <br />This book is  as good a reference source for Pentecostalism as exists.  If it were  updated, it would be even better.	2000-01-25

The charismatic movements are covered a bit more extensively and respectfully here than they are in Harvey Cox's Fire from Heaven. Mr. Synan does not gloss over some of Pentecostalism's more bizarre manifestations, but he is always respectful of the movement as a whole, certainly far more respectful that many mainline Protestants or fundamentalists (which are not the same as Pentecostals, as Mr. Synan takes care to point out)would be. The writing is clear and readable, apart from the fact that Mr. Synan seems to &quot;use quotation marks&quot; indiscriminately, something I find &quot;kind of irritating.&quot; Apart from that, I cannot recommend this book too highly.	2000-01-18

This country is dotted with hundreds of peoples who may be closer to one or the other of the above three categories, but who don't really fit in any of them. These include the Ramapo Mountain People of New York and New Jersey, the Brass Ankles of South Carolina, the Redbones of Louisiana and numerous other groups, some of whom are completely unknown outside of their regions.<br />The most celebrated of these peoples are the Melungeons of western Virgina, eastern Kentucky, and eastern Tennessee and this book is an attempt to write their history. I say &quot;attempt&quot; because until fairly recently, one did not describe oneself as a Melungeon or a Brass Ankle; these were perjorative terms used by outsiders and were strenously and sometimes violently objected to. Consequently, America is filled with people whose families moved around a lot, whose genealogies are muddled if they have one at all and whose family stories are non-existent. People like me(I've pretty much decided that I'm a member of one of these groups, although I have no definite idea which one).<br />According to Dr. Kennedy, the Melungeons may be the descendents of shipwrecked Spaniards, with Portuguese and even Turkish elements, who intermarried with Indians, escaped slaves and poorer whites. Indeed, when they were first encountered, they called themselves Portuguese even though they spoke English. As might be expected, documentation is sparse. Dr. Kennedy, a Melungeon, makes excellent use of his own family's history and genealogy. Some of his conclusions don't, it seems to me, seem completely warranted by what facts there are. But, all in all, this is fascinating book and an excellent beginning to in-depth research on these peoples. One can only hope that members of other such groups will follow Dr. Kennedy's lead. In the meantime, I cannot recommend this book too highly.	2000-01-13

With all the upheaval in the world over the last ten years, a new flag book was badly needed.  And this is as good as any I've seen in some time.  It's up-to-date, its coverage seems comprehensive, and its illustrations  are spectacular.<br />I did run across three rather glaring errors in the  edition I own.  The national flag designated as the flag of Taiwan is  actually the flag of Taiwan's founding political party, the Kuomintang.  Palestine seems to have the civil ensign of Spain. And the flag of  Schleswig- Holstein is pictured but not identified.  <br />But if these and  any other errors are corrected, this book will be as vital a flag reference  as there is.	1999-12-09

There was considerable Confederate sympathy here and there in the North.   And bands of Unionists all over the South continued armed resistance to the  Confederate government from secession until the end of the war.  These  battles were particularly brutal in Missouri, western Virginia, and in East  Tennessee.<br />This book examines Tennessee's civil war.  It looks at East  Tennessee's difference from the rest of the state, starting from the  colonial period and extending to the present day.  It chronicles East  Tennessee's unsuccessful attempt to follow West Virginia's lead and become  a separate state. It documents the Confederate government's inept and  occasionally brutal handling of the situation. And it looks at the postwar  period, when Unionists in Tennessee took their revenge.  <br />Vital.	1999-11-06

The effects of revivals on one urban area, in this case St. Louis, Missouri, would make a worthwhile study in the hands of a competent author.  Beller, however, is not that author.  For one reason, he seems to me to see his particular fundamentalist  Protestant denomination as just about the only Christian church there is.  Too much space is wasted in sectarian carping at other Christians, both  Catholic and Protestant.  Even Billy Graham is not immune.<br />For another  reason, Beller believes that Protestant Christianity died in St. Louis  around 1900(one chapter is entitled &quot;Why St. Louis Went to  Hell&quot;)and he allows nothing to shake him from his idea.  Any St. Louis  revivals after Billy Sunday's in the early 1900's are completely ignored,  including the 1973 Billy Graham revival at which I accepted Jesus as my  Lord and Savior.	1999-09-01

In Missouri, the War for Southern Independence had no rules and was  fought that way, brutally and savagely.  And the most brutal and savage  Missourian of all during this time was William &quot;Bloody Bill&quot;  Anderson.<br />This is an outstanding book, although not for the  faint-of-heart(as was the war it describes).  The only minor fault I found  is that too many of the stories about Anderson come from Union sympathizers  and sound like it.  Of course, this is a limitation with any book written  during this time.  Not many of these men got a chance to sit down and write  their memoirs, so any researcher must take what is available.  And the  authors present Anderson as they found him; I could detect no particular  bias.  This is as good a book as I've ever seen about the WFSI in Missouri  and I highly recommend it.	1999-05-12

Along with Templar history, Professor Barber provides us with detailed looks at the daily lives and commercial activities of these legendary knights of Christ.  It would be difficult to imagine a history of the Templars done any better than this.  Barber's tone is judicious and restrained and, unlike far too many writers on this subject, does not get carried away.  And he neatly demolishes all the survival myths and secret society stories that have grown up around the Templars.  An essential book.	1998-03-11

Despite some impressive scholarship(his chapters on England's Peasants War are particularly interesting;it was a lot more organized than I'd previously thought and would have required something like Robinson's secret association.  And why were Hospitaler properties sacked and Templar properties spared?), Robinson does not quite make his case. Why would this militantly-Christian organization have stayed together all those years?  And why would this Christian organization effectively drop its Christianity?  Robinson's answers are not convincing.  It could very well be that all those French-derived Masonic terms and all those hints in Masonic ritual indicate a Templar connection.  It could also mean an attempt by an imaginative Mason who'd read a book about the Templars to manufacture an impressive pedigree for the Lodge. This book is far better than Baigent and Leigh's Temple and the Lodge, but that's not saying much	1997-12-16
