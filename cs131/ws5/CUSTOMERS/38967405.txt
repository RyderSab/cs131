I finally opted for a 4 because of the hero, Jorlan. However, could someone tell me what on earth the last 2 pages (in italic) are all about ? Is it some kind of metaphor, which my limited intelligence fails to understand ? Or is it implying something sinister and calculating about Green? I hope not because this definitely spoils the whole story which was enjoyable until these last 2 annoying pages. Or maybe it is Joy's last minute hope of redeeming this heroine character, having realized Green is too ordinary for Jorlan, I could only say Joy failed.<br /><br />Roles reversal, a world where women rule and men are to be be protected or abused and toyed with. The idea appeals to me. \\"Ritual of Proof\\" however can do with less so called erotic steamy love scenes. 2 are sufficient in any story and more than that is just too much. It can get pretty stale and very tiring ( Oh dear not another one, here we go again!) I know this is suppose to be a romance, an erotic, but Joy's writing, the characters and story have the potential to be much more than something which could easily be classified as \\"trash\\". I have to admit I have never read anything of Joy's and \\"Ritual of Proof\\" is the first, and sex scenes are probably the norm in any of her story.  A pity, because she does have the imagination to create more solid fantasies.<br /><br />Still Ritual of Proof is an entertaining read. Our hero, Jorlan, is extremely endearing and likable and my main reason for liking this book. My only regret is that Joy changed this character somewhat towards the end. Jorlan was not supposed to be the stereotype. So why have him feel responsible and tie him down with a mundane family life with a wife and child. Joy could have done so much more with this character.<br /><br />A suggestion for Joy. How about a sequel on Jorlan, with him breaking away from the norms and standards. I just cannot bear this character ending up looking after his wife and child and overseeing Green's business. Let him be the wild, unrestrained, raw, rebellious, intriguing yet innocent character he is supposed to be!<br /><br />Those of you looking for another story with a similar theme, try \\"A Brother's Price\\" which has a better story line, much more interesting heroines and where explicit sex scene is not required to convey love.fter his wife and child and overseeing Green's business.

A world of amazons where women share a husband and the husband is valued. After all the usual stories featuring dominating alpha males, \\"A Brother's Price\\" is refreshing and a novelty. The opening of the story takes a little time to get use to. Jerin cooking, looking after the kids while his sisters take up weapons on horsebacks...But once you get use to the reversal of roles \\"A Brother's Price\\" is great fun and even touching.I do not find any feminism in the story. On the contrary \\"A Brother's price\\" appeals to the maternal side of me. A world where us women protect the men folk definitely appeals to me! And the characters are charming, Jerin absolutely adorable and the princesses equally delightful. Some reviewers have difficulty accepting the roles reversal but this is friction and I am glad for Spencer's creativity. How about a sequel!	2005-09-02

Knowing I will be hooked and not just satisfied with one book, I held off reading it until another new book on Miles is available. Strange reason.., maybe.<br /><br />However after the disappointing Hallowed Hunt, I just need to reassure myself that Bujold is still a great writer. I am not disappointed. Diplomatic Immunity may not be the best of the Miles series but it is still a great read and definitely heads above Hallowed Hunt. And of course there is Miles. Intense and quirky, Miles is easily the most memorable and lively character in sci-fi/fantasy today. He is definitely Bujold's greatest creation and it is just so easy to plunge into another crazy adventure with this idiosyncratic but adorable character. No one is disputing Bujold's talent in fantasy. The first book in the Chalion series proves that. But after the lame second and third book in the Chalion series, it is time for Bujold to return to the enigmatic sci-fi world of Miles.	2005-08-22

I am amazed that it is the writer's first book and hope not her last. The plot is unique and exhilarating and the characters absolutely endearing from a trooper all the way to the dark elf lord. Freeman has written a spellbinding tale intermingling humans with the fae and the fantastics effortlessly. There is never a dull moment with both story and characters holding you from page 1 to page 548. Length is definitely not a problem here. Just wish there is more. Told from Rabbit's view, I often found myself laughing out aloud at the happenings around him. Don't get me wrong. Covenants is by no means comical. Far from it. It is just Freeman's marvellous and enlightening writing style. Some reviewers complain about the lack of romance. But it is the very absence of romance, (a common theme which could be boring in a good fantasy-boy meets girl, fall in love and happily ever after), which makes Covenants totally engaging and absorbing. Some complain about the lack of female role but I always like stories concentrating on the brotherhood of men, be them humans or fae, and Covenants has that. Nothing sexual but that's what makes the story great. And of course the protagonist Rabbit is absolutely adorable. I hope to read more of him in the next Borderland novel, which is long overdue. I wish a hard copy is available because this one is for keeps.	2005-08-05

This has been an exhilarating few days for me as I finish the Wraeththu Histories. Like some of the reviewers I was a trifle dismayed yet hopeful when I learned that Storm wished to write a sequel to Wraeththu. It has been more than 15 years since the conclusion of Wraeththu. Yes I could still recall the last part of Wraeththu being rushed and there could have been much more in the reunion of Calanthe and Pellaz. But how does Storm hope to redeem this small but significant fault in Wraeththu, least of all equal the brilliance of this masterpiece. I do not doubt her story telling skill but there is a haunting originality, a sensuality, an innocence in Wraeththu which is not possible to duplicate or match.<br /><br />My fear grew when I found Book 1 of the Wraeththu Histories a sort of a \\"fill-in-the-blanks\\" which does not feature and if so, limited roles of the enchanting and alluring characters in Wraeththu. And it was not written in the first person view which I love so much in Wraeththu. However my fear was unfounded a third through Book 1. Storm has not lost her magic though I still miss Calanthe, Rue, Cobweb and more of Pell of course.<br /><br />Happily these endearing characters reappear in Book 2 which is just brilliant. My favorite characters take center stage again as Storm continue from where she left off in Fulfilments of Fate and Desire (3rd book of Wraeththu). I no longer miss the first person narration. Storm does not need that to inject emotions, intensity and life into her story and characters. Her characters have grown and I like the maturity in Cal, Pell and Cobweb. New characters appear, Moon, Snake, Raven just to name a few, and Storm weave them seamlessly into her magical tapestry of intriguing plots and sub-plots.<br /><br />As I turn to Book 3 (The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence, UK edition), I was again a trifle dismayed with the story shifting to new characters, this time the second generation harlings. I should just have trusted Storm. Book 3 is as enchanting as Book 2. Her protagonists, Pell's sons/high-son, Darq, Loki, Geb, can never equal Cal, Pell and Cobweb,(I have to admit I am bias because nohar else can replace these favorite characters of mine), but they are refreshing and each harling's character is an unique individual. The stories of Pell's sons/high-son, from the day they are \\"hatched\\" to the day they confront each other are equally spell binding.<br /><br />Storm's imagination just keep on growing covering untouched realms without ever dragging her feet or confusing her reader. Few can match her world building skills or the deep interplay of emotions among her characters.<br /><br />And I am very please with the way she continues the love/hate emotions development among Cal, Pell,Galdra and Rue in Book 3. No reader can expect more but as a Wraeththu fan, I am thirsty for much more. Just novellas from now on is just not enough! Long live the Wraeththu Mythos!s Book 2.

Or is she trying to evolve into a dark fantasy writer for adults ? I used to like Harry Potter for its delightful simplicity yet complex wondrous magical world building. It used to be a joy to read Harry's and company's adventures. But somehow from Book 5 onwards, Harry Potter no longer delivers. Book 6 has deteriorated further. Just do not understand the popularity of this series. For those of you who are still a child at heart I recommend the following instead, coming of age books featuring child protagonists which are notches above Rowling's writings, - \\"In the Castle of the Flynns\\", \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", the darker \\"Boy's Life\\", Fantasy/Sci-fi \\"Finity's End\\", \\"Tripoint\\", \\"Rider at the Gate\\", \\"Cloud's Rider\\", \\"Balance of Trade\\", \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Warchild\\" and even the horror \\"IT\\".	2005-07-29

Mystery, supernatural, romance, thriller, this series have them all. The plots are fast and drive you on. Bowie's writing is stylishly simple and to the point. Above all his characters  grow on you. One wish to know them from the beginning and at the end they are like your friends whom you are reluctant to part with. The only complaint I have is the flash backs in \\"A Self-Potrait\\" which should have been part of the first book, \\"A Potrait of Philip\\". But that is just me as I like plots to move forward. Still, \\"A Self-Potrait\\" did not lose its impact. Being written in the first person, \\"A Self-Potrait\\" is the best of the series and more emotional and  the sentimental side of me is wistful for more of Peter and Philip. I hope Bowie will continue with the narrative style in his future effort. Bowie's next effort is something new. I hope this does not mean the end of Peter and his friends.	2005-06-19

Maybe because the writer is Bujold and I have higher expectation from her than any other writers. The main characters just do not lift off and the plot drags in some chapters, and at times confusing. I have the impression that Bujold has breaks during her writing and did not get all her thoughts together on this book. The beginning of the story is intriguing and promising and the ending highly imaginative. It is a pity that the in-betweens are at times slow and disjointed. Regreted buying the hardcopy because Book 3 is not one I will return to, unlike Bujold's Miles series and Book 1 of the Chalion series	2005-06-11

I find it absorbing and ultimately uplifting. I do not know why but Chris reminds me of an older Tiger from \\"Metes and Bounds \\" even though they are 2 totally different persons. I love the character of Tiger and was disappointed that he was not the protagonist of \\"Metes and Bounds\\". The beginning of \\"Back where he started\\" is captivating and simply tugs at my heart. How do you cope when your spouse wishes to kick you out after you have given 22 years of your life to him and his family? It is already hard in a man-woman relationship. It's even more so in a gay marriage which is not sanctioned by law or church. Chris' predicament is heartbreaking. Luckily Quinn did not fall into the easy trap of the typical gay romance tragedy. Chris managed to pick himself up. He retained the love and respect of his \\"children\\". He found a job and even love. Does it sound sappy, like some reviews claim ? Not so for me. Life is already depressing enough. I wish to secure a bit of cheer from fiction and \\"Back where he started\\" definitely meet my expectation and more. It is a rewarding experience to read that a 48 year old gay man could have a fresh start and find happiness despite all the odds. Beautiful!	2005-05-30

Being a silly romantic at heart, I kept postponing reading this book once I knew it was post Daniel and Blaine's break-up. But I love Daniel and just have to know his ups and downs even through Blaine's eyes. I missed Daniel's voice in \\"He's the One\\" and missed it again in \\"I'm Your Man\\". I did not enjoy \\"I'm Your Man\\" as much as I would have liked to. Partly because of the subplots. I skipped most of the parts on Sheila's & Blaine's career life and Blaine's and Gretchen'e effort to have a baby, which I found tedious. OK so I do not like Blaine betraying Daniel that way! I found myself picking up passages to read. Before this book, I have liked Blaine but this time finds this character annoying. I do not expect the protagonist to be perfect but his flings with Ethan and other \\"tricks\\" is plain stupidity. Daniel certainly deserves someone better. OK so I do not like the story line because it concentrates on the unhappy relationship between Daniel and Blaine. Luckily there is a happy ending or else I would not even have read it. You may call me shallow but I prefer to enjoy my books. However as a gay romantic \\"fluff\\" genre, \\"I'm Your Man\\" is better than most out there today. Still this is Daniel's world and I look forward to more of his story.	2005-05-22

How does one cope when one is dying and has to leave one's lover behind ? How does one cope knowing one's lover is dying, waiting for it to happen and knowing nothing can ever bring him back ? Mandal's writing is emotionally charged without being over sentimental. His words are simple yet deeply moving, expressing every emotion deeply. I enjoy \\"The Dandelion Clock\\" a lot and was looking forward to \\"Precipice\\" which surpasses my expectation. It may be shorter than I would have liked but reading it the second time, I realize Jamie, Matthew and Richard do not need more words to tell their touching love story. I cried a few times but it was tears I shed willingly for Matthew and Jamie. I dread tragedies but Mandal has not fallen into the common trap of tragic gay romance. The writer give us hope and one come away satisfied that \\"happily ever after\\" is possible. Not a fan of short stories I hope Mandal will devote more time to novels.	2005-05-16

There is a harsh reality in it which sounds all too familiar in this world of ours when a society rejects and hates those who does not fit into its norms. Heart felt and deeply touching, Sunnie and his story will linger long in my memory. My only complaint is that it is too short and I am not able to find another story by Kracken.	2005-03-02

The translation is solid. Ran and Kei are simply endearing and my favorite Yaoi couple. I am not too fond of Kai but Masa is intriguing. Too bad Kodaka decides to pair up Kai and Masa. I would have prefer Masa to have someone more compatible. Oh well!. Book 3 has 3 stories. First 2 are on Ran and Kei, which are excellent. The first one is comical yet tender. The second one is my favorite. Ran and Kei are forced to question their relationship. Will it stand the test of time? Will they be able to remain true to each other? Kodaka does a great job despite the limitation of words in a manga. She even manage to inject some comical moments in a serious subject. Ran's doubts and Kei's response are beautifully depicted. And of course the erotic sex scenes though the rape scene is a trifle disturbing.<br /><br />The last story on Kai and Masa is a trifle sober but manage to justify to the reader Masa's love for Kai. Do yourself a favor and get Kizuna. Meanwhile I am impatiently waiting for books 4 to 6 which the publisher has announced to be released in 2005.	2005-01-14

How does one cope when one's lover tells you he does care but does not love you... and this definitely provide some heart wrenching moments.

Sensitive, endearing, warm, extremely brave, intelligent yet vulnerable, Odd Thomas is a memorable character and by the end of the story one cannot help but love this unique 20 year old young man and mourn his loss. The plot itself is a page turner, and Odd Thomas as the narrator makes the story a compelling read. Koontz is not one to write a series. The only one thus far are two stories on Christopher Snow. Odd Thomas, tormented by his gifts, is definitely more enigmatic than Christopher Snow. It will be a real treat if Odd Thomas is an exception to Koontz's rule.	2004-09-21

First we can do without pages after pages describing Clare's paper artworks, Chicago and music. I know this is the writer's field and expertise. But is this necessary ? This is fiction and not education on art, geography and music. Second, the pages after pages of Clare's dreams. Sorry I do not appreciate the metaphor here. For me her dreams disrupt the flow of the story and the writer ends up dragging her feet.  Third, the sequence of events leading to Henry's \\"death\\".  The writer is definitely trying to worm into our hearts and squeeze tears from our eyes. But does she need to be so bleak?. Is Henry's loss of his feet really necessary ?  And imagine waiting for your beloved for 47 years until you are 82, near death's door. The ending could even be a dream resulting from the lovers' deep longing for each other. How much more depressing and heart wrenching can you get? This story definitely triumphs in its characters building and Henry is one who will stick in my mind for a long time. And of course the love which is interwoven with time traveling is a novelty besides being heart felt and poignant. This is one story I am glad I read but I am afraid I cannot say I enjoy it.	2004-09-02

This book definitely deserves all the praises of the \\"5 stars reviews\\" before mine. Haddon has written a truly enriching and beautiful story. It is also unique because its narrator, Christopher, is unique. Christopher is not your typical hero. Yet he stands out and this autistic boy has definitely found a place in my heart. His views of his world is so different from the ordinary. Yet he may not be lacking in any way. Captivating and strangely touching, anyone who loves to read should have this book.	2004-09-01

But Male Model is the type of book which puts a smile on your face. I wish there is more of this type of gay romantic books out there today. Life is already depressing enough without writers wearing us out with the tragedy of gay love. You may call me unrealistic but I wish to enjoy my book, not be depressed by it. Male Model suits me fine. It is better than Daytime Drama, Benbow's previous effort. Not in terms of plot. Just that Daytime Drama concentrates too much on the side characters when I wish to read more about Travis and Clay. I am glad Male Model gives more space to Cameron and Blake, our new beautiful heroes, and their breathless romance. Great entertainment and for those of us, sentimental fools who wish for happy endings.	2004-08-20

Have you ever seen something that completely stuns your mind? This is exactly what happened to me when I first saw The Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel. Visually I was so overwhelmed that my mind just could not absorb this titanic Masterpiece.  Thanks to the glorious photographs and comprehensive interpretation in this book, I realize how much more I have missed visually and spiritually. \\"Michelangelo:The Last Judgement-A Glorious Restoration\\" does this Masterpiece justice and reminds us of the God driven powers of Michelangelo. The pictures before and after the restoration are truly revealing and touching.  They tell us of the tremendous effort Colalucci, Mancinelli and their team made to return this Masterpiece to mankind. Sirs, thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br /><br />And Yes I plan to return to the Sistine Chapel this year. Equipped with the knowledge gained from this marvellous book, I am sure this time I will know how to truly appreciate this sublime and colossal Masterpiece.	2004-08-17

Stone took 6 years to research on his biography of Michelangelo. By the end of the book one can only marvel at the tremendous effort Stone undertook. \\"Agony and Ecstasy\\" is truly an absorbing and inspiring tale of the greatest genius in art history. Michelangelo's magnificence in sculpture, painting, architecture and poems is compellingly told. The best parts of the novel are the creations of each sculpture, Michelangelo's greatest love. Michelangelo's intensity and passion as he chisels and hammers away on his beloved marbles is vividly written and deeply moving. His rivalry with Raphael and Da Vinci, his struggles with his family, the Popes, the Medici family, his contemporaries and the tumultuous era he lived in are convincing and underlay with sadness. Certain aspects of his life are poignant and  heart wrenching - the years wasted quarrying marbles never used, his unsavoury father who only wants money from him and of course the uncompleted Julius II Tomb which haunts him till the later years of his life. By the end of the book, one can only love this titanic genius for his awesome and fearsome talents, which could only be God given, his perseverance, his obsession and passion.  The three Pietas, The David, the Madonna and Child in Bruges, Sistine Chapel Vault, Night, Day, Dusk, Dawn, The Last Judgement, St Peter's Dome....Michelangelo is no longer just the creator of these soul stirring, colossal and exalted art works. Stone has given this great genius who lived 500 years ago flesh and blood. Michelangelo is a man driven by his transcendent powers in art, evoking awe, reverence, love and sympathy from us.	2004-08-13

Being an admirer of the magnificent Michelangelo I am very pleased to have acquired this book. The pictures are beautifully printed. By the end of the book I wish to revisit the Sistine Chapel to view those parts printed in the book which I have obviously missed with my naked eyes. The details of the restoration work is an added bonus. To get the most of this book, please read it together with \\"Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling\\" by Ross King.

I am an admirer of the magnificent artist, Michelangelo, and truly appreciate this book which has given me a great insight into the creation of one of his masterpieces, the fresco on the Sistine Chapel vault. The events leading to it, the inter-play of people involved and the on-going battles even as the masterpiece is being painted are information which is truly revealing and remarkable. Equally educational is the technical details which King has given behind the painting of the fresco, even to the chemical component of the paint itself.<br /><br />With his words, King has made the main characters live once again. Michelangelo's relationship with Pope Julius II and rivalry with Raphael is well written and embellished with witty remarks. Michelangelo and Pope Julius II may not like but certainly admire each other and yet these two men are so alike in their demeanors and temperaments. On the other hand, Michelangelo and Raphael share nothing in common except for their great gifts in art. Michelangelo is moody, despondent, anti-social, suspicous even arrogant and  definitely not handsome while the younger Raphael is endowed with beauty whom everyone liked. And who can forget fiery Pope Julius II, battling for territories and fighting the French. This book is not merely informative. It has a great story to tell. At the end of the book, Michelangelo is no longer just a name to an exalted sculpture, painting, structure or poem. He is at once a great genius and a man with character.	2004-08-05

Being a Chinese and familiar with Chinese folk lore and medieval fantasy, I am impressed with the setting, novelty and plot in the Seven Brothers. Chinese myth gods, goddesses, dragons, kings, princes, wizards, heroes, demons, shape-shifters....You name it, this series has it. I am also pleasantly surprised with Benjamin's imagination, which is better than most contemporary fantasy writers. However his writing style is sadly lacking; a lot of repetitions and somewhat mechanical. As a result, his characters came across cardboard-like. A real pity because the myriad characters he  created have the potential to be really alive in the readers' imagination if only he could write with more feelings. A reviewer has compared him with Bujold. Maybe his imagination but definitely not character building. Benjamin should take some lessons from Bujold in characters development. Still I am pleased with the ending. The hero was revealed as the Justice God. A good idea as in Chinese myth the Justice God was a most revered man when he was a mortal.	2004-07-22

I cannot remember how many times I have reread this book, even if not from page 1 till the end, but definitely chapters of it. Besides an amazing plot, the characters have depth and of course the cat with a mind of his own. Heinlein is definitely a great story teller when he sets his mind to it. Our hero's narration of his misfortunes and ultimate revenge and reward is simply delightful reading, with never a dull moment. There are even some sweet moments which are touching. One cannot help but wish the best for our hero and his cat. And this story remains one of the best about time travelling though &quot;Replay&quot; by Ken Grimwood comes a close second. The Door into Summer is simply timeless and will always remain in the front row of my favorite books.	2004-07-20

OK it is not classic but it is fun read, with a plot exciting enough to keep me flipping the pages. I know this is fiction but Brown should have tried harder to get his facts right. I am an admirer of the great genius, Michelangelo and Brown has definitely erred in his reference to this great artist's works. First Michelangelo was not the architect of any stair case in the Vatican City. Second the Vatican does not possess any male nude sculpture by Michelangelo, with its stony penis removed . Dan's errors is irritating and a trifle irresposible. Still Angels & Demons is great entertainment and will not be my last book by this writer.	2004-07-19

Boy's Life is just that. The story is simply beautiful and still captures my heart and imagination after reading it the second time, 10 years later. McCammon is famous for his horrors. But in Boy's Life, Mc Cammon has written a brilliant story filled with sensitivity, humanity and emotional depth.  It is about a 11 year old boy coming of age. Narrated in the endearing young boy's, Cory's, voice, Boy's Life captures what is meant to be a child once, when the world is still magical and filled with wonders, when a bicycle is a boy's steed, friendship is permanent, a dog is one's best friend and even \\"flying\\" is possible. And Boy's Life has its moments of poignancy when Cory has to deal with his best friends' death, evil when and where he least expects and bigotry in his young world. Boy's Life just tugs at my heart as it glows with warmth and comfort when parental love overcome the fears of growing up and always there to rely on in a child's life. Boy's Life is truly a treasure and I promise myself to read this gem again in another 5-10 years time.	2004-07-12

This book is a pleasure to read and transcends my expectation.<br />The story line may not seem much at first glance. After all it depicts one month in the life of the characters. Yet it is imbued with honesty and emotions which leave me truly satisfied towards the end. The characters, Adam, Jeff, Dart, are wonderfully human and it is easy to share their aloneness and insecurity and finally hope. Highly commendable.	2004-06-22

At the end of Diplomatic Immunity, I just need to choose my favorite. Memory is definitey my choice. Action may be light in this book. However this book is not about action. Memory is about Miles as a person, his self examination and growth . He faces his crossroad plus all the little devils accumulated in his 30 years life. Miles' transition from the little admiral into Lord Vorkosigan who is his true self is just brilliantly written. I found myself liking the new Miles more. Memory is a treasure.	2004-05-27

Fire's Stone transcends my expectation and I am very pleased to have acquired this out-of-print fantasy from Amazon market place. The plot and magic is there but it is the 3 main characters and their relationship with each other that truly shines. Aaron, Darvish and Chandra are definitely not stereotypes. They have depth and they are unique, convincing and vividly alive. My favorite is Aaron, the thief tormented by his past.  I found myself caring about what happen to this enigmatic character next. The relationship development between Aaron and Darvish is beautifully conceived and emotionally rewarding. Chandra's role as their sometimes buffer and mediator provide some humorous moments.  My only regret is that there is no sequel and Fire's Stone definitely cries for one. This is one book which should not be out of print!	2004-05-03

Besides an interesting plot and intriguing characters, a great fantasy must have intensity, emotions and depth. Sadly these are missing in Talon of the Silver Hawk. The beginning is fine but after a quarter through the book, I know Feist is not my type of writer. His style lacks sensitivity in his characters.<br />I could not identify with the protagonist and do not really care what happen to him next. This story is just one of the many average and typical fantasies churned out today and definitely not for us who wish our fantasy to have a soul. I would have given 2 stars but well...the plot of the story does seem promising at first glance.	2004-04-15

Yet Alta's plot leaves much to be desired. Is it because Alta is the second book in a trilogy ? Kiron's acceptance among his people is just too easily and conveniently done. And why the girl, Aket-ten ?! From Lackey's over the top detailed description of her amazing talents and courage, she is the hero of the story, not Kiron, not the prince, not the dragons. Aket-ten being the only one capable of speaking to and understanding dragons just does not seem right. This implies that the bonding between dragon and his/her human companion right from the beginning is not as significant as we were led to believe. I like the ideal of the bonding and Aket-ten's empathy with the dragons is simply irrelevant and irritating. Nothing against a heroine, eventhough the character Aket-ten seems contrived, but from Joust I was led to believe and still prefer both Kiron and Ari to have centre stage. Ari is admirable and an interesting character and I am disappointed that Lackey has ignored him in Alta, except for the confrontation with Kiron, which sadly turn out to be an anti-climax. I expected much more from Lackey's imagination and I hope she will deliver in the third installment.	2004-04-14

Its plot is unique and brilliantly conceived. Matthews' world is grim, intense and strangely moving. The characters have depth and I definitely care about what happen to the protagonist and his &quot;slaves&quot; next. It is disappointing that this book and the next two in the series are out-of-print. I am just glad to have acquired them from Amazon market place.

The plot is there and definitely the novelty, the magic and the excitement. The myriad characters of  humans, sorcerers, demons and of course the horses and the world they live in are brilliantly conceived. My salute to Wurts for her vivid imagination. However for me, it is the protagonist, the warrior Mykkael who truly shines. I find myself engrossed with his purpose, his sorrows, his die-hard loyalty, his dignity, his courage and finally his emotional triumph.<br />My only regret is that this splendid fantasy has not been crafted into a trilogy. The references to Mykkael's past life definitely justify this approach. The first of the trilogy could have been about Mykkael's birth, youth, ostracism from his tribe, the second concerning his life as a mercenary tormented by the horror of fighting sorcery culminating to his loss and finally the third, the story &quot;To ride Hell's Chasm&quot; itself. However with the ending Wurts has weaved I guess I have to say goodbye to Mykkael. I will definitely miss this amazingly intriguing and enigmatic character and the world he lives in. Still the conclusion is satisfying as Mykkael finally gets his just rewards. Truly an amazing read.	2004-03-23

From the first book, &quot;Neverness&quot; to &quot;The Broken God&quot; to &quot;The Wild&quot; and finally &quot;War in Heaven&quot;, I just could not put the series down. Yes there are times when Zindell tend to be repetitive in his philosophical views but the intensity of the story and characters more than makes up for it. &quot;Neverness&quot; is simply exquisite with spectacular world building and intriguing characters. The protagonist, Mallory, a brilliant and complex personality is definitely one sci-fi character I will remember. &quot;The Broken God&quot; is simply profound though at times Zindell tends to be overboard with his philosophical views. At first I miss Mallory's narration as the first person. However by the middle of &quot;The Broken God&quot;, I found myself engrossed with Danlo's fate and liking this protagonist immensely. From the negative reviews of &quot;The Broken God&quot;, I perceive that some readers have stopped reading the series due to the slow pace of &quot;The Broken God&quot;. That is a real pity because no sci-fi die-heart should miss &quot;The Wild&quot;. Here Zindell displays his remarkable world building skills and vivid imagination once again. The pace here is fast and I found myself imprisoned by Danlo's adventures. &quot;War in Heaven&quot; is equally though provoking and captivating. Danlo's loss here is intensely written and I found myself moved to tears. &quot;War in Heaven&quot; is a sastisfying conclusion to the series as Danlo completes his soul searching and finally &quot;sees&quot; his role in the universe or should I say universes. As usual with any great stories, I am sad that the end comes too quickly. I will miss Danlo, Mallory, Soli, Bardo and the Solid State Entity but am glad to have discovered Zindell's world. I am please to add Zindell to my list of must read writers and look forward to reading his new fantasy series. It is a pity that this brilliant writer is not more widely recognized.pity that this brilliant writer is not more widely recognized.	2004-02-24

However thanks to Cherryh's detailed and absorbing story telling, this handicap does not deter me from enjoying Finity's End. There is no over the tops space battle or fight to the end scenes in Finity's End. Finity End is about a young man's struggle to find himself, male bonding and meanings of the words &quot;family&quot; and &quot;peace&quot;. All this is told against an intelligently conceived universe where men seems to have conquer all the stars and, sadly, sharing this large universe with only one other type of living being besides himself. Finity's End is one of Cherryh's best even though the ending needs finer editing. Thank you Cherryh for such a beautifully written and compelling story.	2004-01-21

The second book, Armageddon Inheritance is the best - an amazing alien enemy, heroism, amazing space battles and of couse my favorite character Dakar who was the ultimate hero. Heirs of Empire is good too but I felt let down by the ending which seems rushed - the adventures of Sean and Company was top entertainment until the abrupt conclusion.

It has everything a great fantasy should have i.e. a breathless and intelligent plot  and a wonderful cast of characters-the  heroic prince and his princess, the smart talking unicorn named \\"Breeze\\", the wise talking dragon, the prince's almost ruthless but pragmatic brother, a king too old to rule, a disllusioned warlord and last but not least the traitors and demons.

I guess I have an overdose of Koontz after \\"Strange Highways\\". After reading \\"The Face\\" I am glad to include Koontz once again in my list of \\"look-out for\\" writers. The Face is not Koontz's best in terms of plot, lacking behind \\"Watcher\\", \\"Cold Fire\\" and \\"Fears Nothing\\". As such, The  Face seems too long. One hundred pages less will surely makes it a much better read. I am also put off by the reference to \\"Hollywood life\\". However Koontz more than makes up for the plot with the intensely developed characters. Ethan and Fric, the two protagionists are immensely captivating. Fric's loneliness, as his  parents love themselves more, and Ethan's emptiness after his wife's death is touchingly told. There is an honesty and vulnerability in them which keeps me rooted to their story and fate. And of course there is Corky, who is evil in all its completeness. The ending is uplifting and I am glad Ethan and Fric have each other to live for.	2003-09-01

A marvelous blend of sci-fi and gay romance, it has an intelligent plot with a touching love story which knows no barrier. The two protagonists, Kallen and Aaric are wonderfully appealing. One can forgive the writer for his near perfect heroes because this is fiction and heroes should be beautiful. Kallen's early encounters with 3 lovers who deserted him is almost heart breaking, Kallen's loneliness is captured with a heart felt and stark honesty. How Kallen met Aaric in the second book is especially romantic, even with a sprinkle of humor. Kallen's decision to give up his world to stay with Aaric and his sorrows when he though Aaric fails to keep their date just tugs at my heart.  All this is told against a background with a future world which is almost frightening but equally possible and it is sad that this future world is still homophobic. To top it all is the compelling yet touching epilogue which I especially like yet leaves a lingering sadness in me long after I finished the 3 books. Definitely a must read!	2003-09-01
US	38967405	R7JX9ZCJYDXXP	0758204051	647633295	Last Summer	Books	5	1	3	N	Y	Compelling!	There is a stark honesty to this book which makes it all so poignant yet uplifting in the end. The cast of characters and their stories are brilliantly conceived and written with a heart felt sincerity. The main characters seem so real that I wish they truly are. Even the side characters are vividly potrayed. With a captivating dialogue it is just so easy to be imprisoned by \\"Last Summer\\". Like all great books, there is a lingering emptiness long after I finished Last Summer because one wishes there is more. I look forward to Ford's next novel.	2003-09-01

This is sci-fi fiction with a touch of fantasy at its best. It may be written over 25 years ago but still holds its own today and surpasses most of its kind. The hero may lack depth but the astounding imagination of Vance in his creation of the Planet and its colourful mystical inhabitants more than make up for it. A truly amazing classic.	2003-08-20
US	38967405	R2ODV4E7EWPI12	0552142530	759701806	Dark Moon	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Great Heroic Fantasy! Could have been a masterpiece......	Dark Moon is my first book by Gemmell. I am impressed and have acquired more of his books. Dark Moon is a great entertaining heroic fantasy. Its plot is fast and compelling enough to keep me turning the pages and its characters just grow on you. My favorite is of course Tarantio and his twin Dace. The introduction of Tarantio/Dace and their adventures, though short, is the best part of Dark Moon. I wish Gemmell will write more stories in the future featuring this intriguing character.  Duvodas is another appealing character though sounds familiar in fantasy. Another merit of Dark Moon is that the side characters are solid and not just there to fill the pages. However, I did not think much of the third main character, Karis. Probably because I dislike female heroes who are meant to \\"kick butts\\" but ultimately betrayed by this feminine weakness underneath just because they are women!  Hence Karis came up lame. At last! Dark Moon is too short! Dark Moon has the potential to be a masterpiece if only Gemmell has taken more pains in expanding on the characters and dealt deeper on the plot. A pity ! Hence 4 and not 5 stars.	2003-08-20

Roeder's books may be aimed at gay teens but I found myself enjoying his books though I am over 40. Thus far I have finised his books in one sitting and \\"This Time Around\\" is no exception. Jordan's search for his past, his reconciliation with his grandparents, his final acceptance of what happened to his father is touchingly written. I have to admit I was in tears quite a few times. The part of gay bashing seems familiar. However gay bashing is pervasive in today's society and not something we are proud of and Roeder's reminder of its existence is admirable. And I do like the way it is linked to Jordan in the story. Overall, \\"This Time Around\\" is a simple story yet complex in its entirety. It is emotionally told and I enjoy it. As I dislike tragedies, I have yet to bring myself to read Ancient Prejudice and The Soccer Fied is Empty, the tragic stories of Jordan's father and Mark. After reading \\"This Time Around\\", I think I can finally bring myself to read this two tragic stories. I hope the next book in this gay chronicles series is not too far away.	2003-08-18

I am in for an unpleasant surprise.<br />The first book is OK but the second book fails to deliver. A few times I wanted to quit reading altogether but I carried on hoping the third book will start to redeem the series. I am disappointed. At the end of the third book, which I somehow managed to finish after telling myself several times the plot will start to pick up soon, I have decided to abandon the 4th and 5th book. The plot is dull and repetitive. The characters who manage to shine in the Belgariad series, have become colourless and boring. The dialogue is deadpan and a few times I found myself wanting to hurl the book aside because of the same repetitive comments. The worst is Garian's wife who just irritates me! Yes she is already an irritating spoilt character in the Belgariad series but I have hoped she will become more mature but no such luck! I am hesitating to read the other series by Eddings I bought recently on the merit of the Belgariad series. I should have read the Mallorean series before I venture further into Edding's works. Sigh! I probably will just scan the end of the 5th book just for the sake of finishing the series. A major disappointment!	2003-08-18

This is one of the better fantasy-horror I have read in a long time and also my first book by SR Green. I am greatly impressed and has secured Green's other books available in Amazon. \\"Something from the Nightside\\" may be a trifle short but it has much more than I bargained for. A near perfect blend of fantasy and horror with more than its share of excitement, I just could not put it down. The protagonist is an enigmatic character and wonderfully appealing. I hope Greene will extend this into a series.	2003-08-07

I picked up Midshipman's Hope 12 days ago and just could not stop reading the Seafort saga. From Midshipman's Hope to the most recent Children of Hope, it has been a most enjoyable and rewarding experience. The plot is intense and riveting, the characters vividly alive. I love the protagonist, Nick Seafort.  I love the way Feintuch develops Seafort's character. From a young midshipman to captain to saviour of the human race to  secretary-general to possibly saviour of both his kind and the alien,  he is one of the most endearing, intriguing and complex hero I have encountered in Sci-fi/fantasy. He is a man of honor, courage and integrity. He is devoted to his God, despite his doubts, and haunted by his sense of duty. Yet he  is compassionate, vulnerable and sensitive.  My favorite in the series is Challenger's Hope which moves me to tears a few times, Prisoner's Hope a close second and Patriarch's Hope a close third. Voices of Hope is good but the narrations by two of the trannies characters is sheer torment as  it was a struggle to make sense of the trannies' language or jargon Feintuch has created. I ended up skipping most of the trannies' narration. Please Feintuch, no more trannies' language or any such jargon in the future of the series. I also hope that Feintuch will stay with Seafort as the narrator in future as the story somewhat loses its intensity when the narration is by another character as is the case in Voices of Hope and Children of Hope. The ending section of each book has thus far been climatic and simply stunning.  Children of Hope leaves me with a great sense of anticipation, crying for more from Seafort, his children and friends. Feintuch, I salute you for such an amazing saga. Keep it up!	2003-06-20

From Midshipman's Hope to Challenger's Hope to the end of Prisoner's Hope I am still hooked badly and will no doubt finish the rest of the 4 books in the next week. I just have to pause to praise the first 3 books of the series. Some reviews do not seem to think too highly of Nick Seafort but I found myself liking the hero. Raised by a deeply religious and stern father one could understand Nick's fears for God, the high standards he set for himself and his angst. The plot is riveting though depressing in Challenger's Hope. I found myself near tears a few times in Challenger's Hope and Philip's heroic sacrifice is heart rending though it is to be expected in military science fiction. Feintuch has written a great action packed saga with well developed characters and I am glad to add him to my list of must read writers.	2003-06-13

As the Foreigner series has become one of my top favorite sci-fi/fantasy saga, I just have to do my part, at least to rate the series 5 stars even if my review is not as comprehensive as others. I am not much into sci-fi but I picked up this series a month back as I was impressed with Cherryh's Fortress fantasy series. I was hooked from the first book (Foreigner) and had a most enjoyable 2 weeks finishing all 6 books in this intelligent and riveting saga embellished with amazing characters. Cherryh did a brilliant job in her characterization and relationships development among three different  \\"beings\\", the enigmatic atevi, the humans in space and the humans who have settled on the alien world. Her main characters Bren, Illisidi and Jase are intelligently and vividly developed and all the side atevi characters are just as  appealing. Cherryh also did a great job delineating the intimate relationship between Bren and Jago. The pace may be slow in the second and fifth book but the deep characterization and thought provoking plot more than made up for it. I hope Cherryh will continue with a third trilogy.	2003-06-06

Since reading Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, a fantasy saga by Williams I have rated him as one of my must read writer. I was of course looking forward to the War of the Flowers. It is certainly not Williams' best effort. The story started off well and Williams did a great job delineating Theo's life especially his touching relationship with his mother. However from the time Theo entered the faerie realm, the tone sort of changed and I have the impression I was watching \\"The Man in Black\\" except that I was reading it in words. There is excitement and the plot keeps you moving along but the characters just lack depth. Theo who started off interesting ended as a clumsy somewhat dull protagonist and the side characters are just there to fill the pages. Still if you are looking for just an enjoyable read go ahead and buy this.	2003-06-06

I have looked forward to this latest fantasy from Berg as I was greatly impressed with her last effort, the splendid Rai-kirah saga. I finished the \\"Song of the Beast\\" in a day. It is a highly addictive fantasy with a unique plot and definitely a notch above most fantasies out there today. Berg's writing is as brilliant. However, I just have to rate this book four stars though I like it. Reason being Song of the Beast lacks the depth of characterization and intensity present in the Rai-kirah saga.<br />Aidan is a likable character but somewhat pales in comparison to Seyonne, the protagonist in the Rai-kirah saga. The side characters in the Song of the Beast also lack depth, including Lara who narrates the story in the later part of the book. Though this gives a different perspective to the tale as seen from Lara's view I wished Berg has just kept to Aidan as the narrator. Song of the Beast is not a series and its tale too short to justify 2 narrators. Maybe Song of the Beast could have been more worthy of Berg if she has added another 100 pages. After reading the Rai-kirah saga, Song of the Beast seems like a novella which could also be the reason this book lacks the intensity in the Rai-kirah saga. However Berg has continued to prove her talent and my only regret is that she is not writing fast enough.	2003-05-30

It is a \\"feel-good\\" book that brightens my day. One easily grows to care about Taylor, Tom and Gen, and even Molly whose change of heart gives the story quietly humorous light moments. Taylor and Tom are immensely likable and their vulnerability and sensitivity as they overcome their internal struggles and doubts to find the faith to love each other is wonderfully written. As I am a sentimental fool, I find myself rereading various parts, Taylor meeting Tom, Tom's poem to Taylor, Tom chasing after Taylor and finally Taylor and Tom finding each other...Finding Faith is just that, finding the faith and courage to love and be true to each other and that monogamy is possible. A marvellous effort from Barriger and I hope there is much more to tell about Taylor and Tom.	2003-05-10

Here Cherryh shines in her development of the Atevi characters, each one distinct and complex in his/her won way. Bren Cameron is of course as appealing and it is wonderful to find him growing close to his alien friends. Of course there is the subtle hints of affection (maybe love?) between Bren and Jago which I hope Cherryh will explore deeper in future books. The pace maybe slow at the beginning but the build-up to a possible collision between the Atevi and 2 different human cultures, one on land and the other in space is exquisitely handled. Now to start the third book! Well done Cherryh!	2003-05-10

I decided to give this series a try as I was impressed with the Fortress Series, a fantasy series by Cherryh. I am not disappointed. I find myself engrossed. The world in Foreigner is spellbinding with both human and alien characters vividly alive. The protagonist is appealing. His self doubts and angst as he tries to understand and befriend the Artevi is wonderfully written. However Cherryh should try to cut-back a trifle on Bren's perspectives which tend to be repetitive at times. I will definitely continue with the series and am actually please there are 5 more books to-date.	2003-05-09

Donaghe gets better and better. \\"All Over Him\\" is a worthy addition to this lovely series. Here we find Will and Lance trying to stay true to each other though separated by distance. Of course this is not easy. Thrown into a different environment, each young man has to overcome temptation and desires which seems an impossible feat in the real world. But this is fiction, and should gives us hope that monogamy is possible.<br />Being a sentimental fool, I find myself screaming at Will to just drop everything and go to Lance. But I understand Donaghe's message. Will is only 19 and needs to sort out his feelings for his Uncle Sean, whom he loves since 14, and his husband, Lance. Uncle Sean's emotional search for one true love to spend his life with just tugs at my heart. I am glad he finally found Hank and Hanky Hank. The ending is satisfying but I hope Donaghe is not considering to end the series. All Over Him is one year in Will's life when he was 19. I am sure Will and Lance has much more to tell.	2003-05-04

Donaghe writes from his heart and Lance proves just that.<br />Lance is a wonderful follow-up to Uncle Sean. Will's and Lance's angst and struggles in a homophobic small community is compellingly written. Lance's near rape and \\"castration\\" just leaves my heart cold. I am glad that Will's and Lance's love for each other is strong enough to withstand the hostility and animosity. They maybe just 18 but their committment to each other and their referring to each other as husband just warms my heart. The ending is frustrating as it leaves Will \\"hanging\\" but it is a perfect bridge to the 3rd book. Keep it up Donaghe!	2003-05-04

Necromancer is nearly flawless except for a few scenes which tend to drag eventhough they are meant to keep the reader on the edge, example the escape under the prison cells which I feel is a trifle too long. The plot is riveting but for me the story scores on the characters. Whether primary or secondary, each character is wonderfully developed, each one with a life of his/her own. The protagonist, Nick and his compatible and strong lover, Madeline, are especially likable. So is Ari, the sorcerer, though I wish Wells has concentrated more on him. Madeline's powerful \\"witch-grandmother\\" is another endearing character though short lived. Overall a tremendous effort!	2003-05-02

But the book just fails to deliver. The writer  fails to build up on the characters. A pity because the three main characters tangled in a love triangle could have been developed so much better. The writer also places too much emphasis on the killer. The writer is too ambitious as he wishes to convey too much in a 120 pages book.

I am pleasantly surprised and found myself unable to put the book down, savoring every page. Bujold has created a colourful world filled with intrigues and embellished with vividly alive characters. Cazaril is a wonderfully appealing hero. A man nearly destroyed by betrayal and sufferings, Cazaril still manages to live and fight for another day. His will to overcome every obstacle thrown in his path and rising to the occassion to achieve the impossible is the strength of the story. His devotion to his ladies is beautifully written and especially touching. This is one fantasy in which I find the ending most satisfying. Still I am wishful for more from Cazaril and his ladies. Bujold is famous for her Miles series but that is sci-fi. Bujold, how about extending \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" into \\"Cazaril and his ladies\\" fantasy series. This book is a must read.	2003-04-27

The atmosphere is intense with vivid  descriptions of a South drowned in bigotry and racism, flash-backs of World War Two, the steamy going-ons in the Hotel and finally the msytery murder hovering in the background. Seems a lot in a close to 300 pages book but Mackle melds everything together beautifully. The characters are wonderfully appealing, in particular Dan, the narrator, who is just great. The side characters, Bud, Carmen and Admiral Asdeck are equally colourful. Even Tommy the piano player at the hotel and a priest finally \\"coming-out\\" have stories of their own. To top it all, there is the build-up of the relationship between Dan and Bud, from buddies entangled in intense passion, to finally, I hope, devoted lovers.

I love Storm Warning (5 stars) but feel let down by Storm Rising (3.5 stars) and Storm Breaking (3.5 stars). Main reason being I like my story to concentrate on just one or the maximum 3 characters, which is the case in Storm Warning. Lackey's shift to other characters in the Empire who have their own long long stories to tell in the last 2 books just put me off. Maybe she is trying to build a sense of anticipation and climax but I find myself frustrated and just wish to skip the pages detailing the Empire characters. I wish she has just continued to concentrate on Karal (a lovely character), An'desha and Firesong. However I must compliment her on the last part of Storm Breaking which features three of my favorite persons in the Last Herald Mage Series. This series could have been better but it is still an enjoyable read.	2003-04-23

I have a most enjoyable one week plus reading the Fortress series. Fortress in the Eye of Time, the first book, was simply exquisite. Fortress of Eagle and Fortress of Owl were slow paced but the great characterization more than made up for it. I just love Tristen, who is one of the most lovable and appealing heroes I have come across in fantasies. Tristen's innocence, his joy in every revelation in nature and the world he is summoned to, his discovery of men and his growing love for his friends is beautifully written. I just have to know what happen to him next. Initially Fortress of Dragons seems a worthy addition to the series until I come to the last one hundred pages. I am just frustrated and disappointed. How could Fortress of Dragons be the final book of the series ? There are too many questions with unsatisfactory answers. What exactly is Tristen's purpose ? Who exactly is Tristen ? Lord of Shadows? The prophesized High King? An ancient magical being reincarnated? How could the writer gives such a vague ending to this wonderfully appealing character ? Also, what about Cefwyn's two sons ? Do they have roles to play in Tristen's life ? The last two pages of the book, so called spotlights, detailing a letter exchange between the two dear friends, Tristen and Cefwyn, just makes me scream for a sequel. I fervently hope Cherryh will continue with the series and do justice to Tristen and his friends. Cherryh, please don't destroy the series with such a vague ending.	2003-03-31

I spent a most enjoyable week reading the Farseer Trilogy. The ending however has much to be desired. Surely Fitz deserves a much better ending after all his sacrifices and struggles. And there are loose ends which I find irritating. The only reason I am ignoring the frustrating ending and still rate the trilogy 5 stars is because I hope that Hobb will redeem herself with the follow-up trilogy, \\"The Tawny Man\\". Except for the ending, which is the spoiler, the Farseer Trilogy is a beautifully written and spell binding series. Hobb is a luminous and gifted writer. Thus it is a very rewarding experience to read The Farseer Trilogy from the first person perspective. It is easy to feel deeply for Fitz, be captivated by his colourful adventures and be sadden by his struggles through his young and painful life. As I hate to be left \\"hanging\\" in any series, I will start the Tawny Man  after the whole trilogy is published. I do hope \\"The Tawny Man\\" will not end in a sour note for Fitz.	2003-03-16

The world Lackey has created is rich and her descriptons of her dragons and their habits loving, vivid and magical. Her young protagonist, Vetch, is immensely likeable and Ari, the secondary character is just as charming. Nowadays, alot of so called epic fantasies seek for heavy plots and too many characters which I find hard to follow after a while and even frustrating at times. Joust has a simple plot but it possesses all the merits of a captivating fantasy. Joust proves that a fantasy does not need to be convoluted with myriad plots and sub-plots to keep a reader hooked. I look forward to more from Vetch, now named Kiron, Ari and their dragons. Lackey, please don't let us wait too long.	2003-03-16

Similarity has been made between Warchild and Ender's Game as both are about a child forced into battles between humans and aliens. 15 years after I read Ender's Game I still remember it because of its climatic ending. Warchild does not have the same stunning ending but which other scifi has come close anyway. However Warchild's characterization has depth and is emotionally wrought. Jos is a likeable hero. Written in first person, it is easy to feel for Jos as he became an orphan at eight and used by others for their own ends throughout his boyhood. Jos struggles with his loyalties and finally becoming his own man is compellingly written. Niko, Azarcon, Evan are intriguing side characters and one wish the story is longer just to know them better. The only complaint I have is the vagueness of Jos one year captivity under Falcone. We only know what really happened much later in the book. This is an outstanding story and definitely begs for a sequel.	2003-03-15

Restoration does not disappoint. It is a worthy ending to this magnificent series. So much so that I feel somewhat empty towards the last sentence simply because the series has ended and I will no longer have the pleasure of reading about Seyonne. But I am grateful that I have discovered Berg and her world and look forward to this must read writer's next effort. Restoration does not stand on its own and must be read after the first 2 in the series to really appreciate it and the whole series. I am lucky to have read all 3 continuously with no long waiting in between. I always feel that no writer should attempt the narration of his tale in the first person unless he is a gifted writer who writes from the heart. Berg is just such a writer. Her brilliant writing in first person just sweeps me along as I become enmeshed in Seyonne's world and struggles. In Seyonne Berg has created a wonderful hero whom I will always remember. Thank you Berg for such an amazing series and please do not let us wait too long for your next story!	2003-03-02

I love this book and my heart is still aching 3 hours after I finished it. I thought being as old as I am no book would be able to move me to so much tears least of all a fantasy. But I was wrong as my eyes just blurred with tears towards the last part of Magic Price. This book is invaluable. Not because of the magic or the style of writing because I have read better ones. It is Vanyel, his Life-bond and his Companion which makes Magic Price and the series itself so special and priceless. I will always love Vanyel and remember Vanyel for his struggles to find himself, his vulnerability, his sensitivity, his inherent goodness and his sacrifice for those he loves. The Last Herald-Mage Series will always be one of my favorites to be treasured always. It is definitely not only for young adults as some claim. It is for all of us with love in our hearts.	2003-02-28

Magic Promise is just as spell binding. Not because of the fantasy aspects or the magic because I have read more imaginative ones. It is the protagonist, Vanyel, who imprisons me. I admit I am in love with this beautiful character. Twelve years after Magic Pawn, Vanyel  is now a great herald-mage held in awe by all. Yet he remains sad and so much alone that my heart goes out to him. His struggles with his sexual preference, his attempt to make peace with his father and the arms master who tortured him during his boyhood and the loss of his soul mate 12 years ago which continues to haunt him is touching and beautifully told. Vanyel's pain as he conjures up his soul mate by magic because he misses him so much and Vanyel's final acceptance of his death is just heart rending. Vanyel facing Death, who gave him the choice to live to fight and protect those he loves or final peace and release from pain and sufferings towards the end of Magic Promise just tugs at my heart. Still Magic Promise has its light and tender moments provided by the unique bond and love between Vanyel and his Companion. Because of Vanyel I have added Lackey to my list of must read writers.	2003-02-26

I read it close to 10 years ago. I have just finished it the second time. I am just as enthralled as ever with this historical fantasy filled with enchantments and interlaced with tender romantic moments. I will always love Alfred, the innocent and beautiful elf monk, turned powerful elf lord after much struggles with his real true self. I will always appreciate Thea who loves him from the very beginning. Finally who could ever forget Alfred's encounter with Richard, the Lion Heart, Alfred's sorrows during the disastrous invasion of Constantinople and finally Alfred's torment in the last of the trilogy when he thought he has lost all those he loves. My only complaint is the seemingly rush writing towards the end. On the other end, it maybe I did not wish the tale of Alfred, Thea, their children and their elf kin to end. The Hound and the Falcon is definitely one of my favorites to be treasured always.	2003-02-26

I bought \\"The Last Herald-Mage\\" series some time ago because I was told it was great. However I kept postponing reading it because I usually avoid sad stories and felt that I could be too old for the type of fantasies written by Lackey.  After much persuasion by a friend I finally read Magic Pawn last week end. Sigh..I love this book and yes I cried several times. I am completely captivated by Vanyel. I felt his pain and his suffering. His loss  was just heart wrenching. This is a great book about character building and a young man's struggles to find acceptance and a place for himself in a world which has ostracized him. In particular, the love between Vanyel and his Companion is touching.  I am hooked and will continue to the end of the series despite being warned of a tragic ending.	2003-02-25

Revelation is a worthy follow-up to Transformation. I finish it in 2 days, not easy given that it is my working week days. But it is worth it despite my tired red eyes!  The extension of this amazing series plot to cover the demon realm, the source of their existence and their purpose is riveting. The first 1/3 and last 1/3 of the book is just astounding. The only part when the pace slows down and I could take a breath was during Seyonne's enchantment under the she-demon. Besides that Berg does not let-up at all. The protagonist, Seyonne, is a wonderful character. I love his goodness, his courage, his loyalty and above all his vulnerability and sensitivity. Since the book is written in the first person, one could not help but be caught up in Seyonne's loss, pain and suffering. Berg's words are so emotionally charged that a few times I wish she could be kinder to Seyonne because he fully deserves it. Perhaps I am a sentimental fool but I wish Berg would give Seyonne a soul mate to truly love and understand him.<br />I have just ordered Restoration, the last installment of this magnificent trilogy, and will definitely put one day aside to finish it.	2003-02-18

Its is lyrical, unique and possesses a raw honesty which imprisons me from the very beginning. The main characters, \\"BOY\\", \\"O\\", \\"Mother\\" and even \\"Father\\" are absolutely fascinating. The love between \\"BOY\\" and \\"O\\" is conveyed lucidly without any barrier or qualm. I will always remember \\"Ready to Catch Him Should He Fall\\" because it is so stunningly unique. It is disappointing that this book is out of print and could not be enjoyed by all of us who appreciate a real gay romance.	2003-02-16

It is beautifully written and laced with heart felt emotions. Its plot is tightly woven and almost flawless. Its magical world is utterly fascinating. And above all Seyonne, the protagonist, is an endearing hero. Courageous, vulnerable and sensitive this is the type of hero any great fantasy series should endeavor to have. This book could stand on its own. However I am hooked and will definitely read the rest of the trilogy and future effort from Berg.	2003-02-15

I know nothing about baseball but I still manage to enjoy this hilarious, witty and well written satire. My only complaint is that it lacks in-depth examination of the love between Randy and DJ. After all the cover does spell out that this is a love story.<br />Or does the writer imply something else. Some of the side characters are well developed, in particular the Egyptian psycharist.<br />Overall the story is great fun!	2003-02-03
US	38967405	R3QLBCDL5Y56TQ	1555837638	428025231	Different People: A Novel	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Just too much to take in one book !	I just finished this book after much agonizing hours. This book is definitely not entertaining or enjoyable to read and probably Outland never intended his story to be that type of friction. Different People is heavy reading. It is too wordy with Orland trying to cramp all his views on Aids, drugs, life and even American politics into 300 over pages. The reviews at the back of the hardcopy definitely got it wrong. Different People certainly does not center on the supposed romance between Eric and Cal, the novel's two protagonists. They are hardly ever together and when they are truly together, one can actually count the number of times they spoke to each other. Definitely not a love story but Outland's opinions of the world he lives in. In addition, Eric and Cal are not easy to like or sympathize with. It is difficult to like this book.	2003-01-31
US	38967405	RXT2EVUPL9A9Z	1555832903	74382942	The Lord Won't Mind (Peter & Charlie Trilogy) (Peter & Charlie Series)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Timeless !	I just reread this timeless novel and am as engross as ever in the love between Charlie and Peter. Again I find myself loving Peter but not Charlie. Perhaps because I am sentimental at heart and hates it when one half of a loving relationship abandons and betrays the other just because suddenly he could not withstand the pressure. However the satisfying ending makes up for Charlie's betrayal. Once again I feel that Charlie's and Peter's story should have just ended with The Lord Won't Mind and not continue into a trilogy. Reason being The Lord Won't Mind is perfect and complete in itself and the second and third books just spoil the enthrallment of Charlie's and Peter's love for each other.	2003-01-30

I was frustrated reading most parts as I felt Talylor could have developed them better. Maybe it is the editing, the sometimes deadpan dialogue and and lack of style. Or the writer is trying to tell too much in such a short story. However I will keep a look out for Taylor's future effort as he does show glimpses of a promising writer in certain scenes of Dinner Club, like the poignant moment shared by the members of Dinner Club when they could not even bring themselves to acknowledge the word \\"Gay\\".	2003-01-29
US	38967405	R5WAVWHTMF5AP	0854491368	430603399	N for Narcissus	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A pleasure to read!	Narcissus lacks the touching sweetness in \\"Sweet Lavender\\" by the same writer. However this is still a great historical gay story, thoughtfully written and wonderfully entertaining. I read into the early morning just to finish it. In \\"Narcissus\\" Hunt continues with Algy's life, 11 years after he left Willie. Willie is Hunt's protagonist in Sweet Lavender and I am please that this delightful character is featured once again in Narcissus towards the last one third of the book. In Narcissus, Algy has settled down with a lovely wife and children. However he is far from happy as he is slowly awaken to his real self. His struggles to finally attain his true love is the center of the story. The background depicting the trials of Oscar Wilde and gay men's struggles in a prohibitive and often demeaning Victorian society is luminously written. The latest Hunt's historical novel was published in 1999. Mr. Hunt, if you read this I hope you have not discontinued investing your amazing talents in historical romance.	2003-01-29
US	38967405	R33BYYUV9RT1UG	0374184445	284428349	Leaps of Faith	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	An amazing book!	Leaps of Faith is truly captivating. Its plot is rich and moving. Its characters are endearing and vividly alive, especially Warren and Flip. However too much emphasis is placed on the union and the strike. Also, the side stories of Tanya and the lesbian couple in Flip's theatre group seem irrelevant. But the relationship developments between Warren and Flip, between the couple and their respective sister, between the couple and their little girl,Juliet, makes the book shines. The strength in Warren and Flip's relationship culminating to their \\"marriage\\" is rare, touching, deeply emotional and beautifully told. I hope Kranz will invest her talents in another novel soon.	2003-01-27

If you want light reading which gives you a wonderful time, read this book and of course the series itself. Alex, Peter (Alex's lover), and Jeanne (Alex's mother) are lively and engaging characters whom I just enjoy reading about. Each of their adventure is a delightful romp and Capital Queers is no exception. However I wish Hunter will tone down Jeanne's role in his next effort and give more credit to Peter. After all Peter is Alex's significant other. Looking forward to more from the trio each year.	2003-01-27

To-date I have read the first 5 books in the series and have enjoyed all of them. However \\"Boy Toy\\", which I just finished, is exceptionally great. The plot is masterfully crafted. I thought I guessed the identity of the killer but I was wrong. And of course I am delighted with the renewed emphasis on Mark's and Neil's relationship in \\"Boy Toy\\" because their love seems to have cooled down after \\"Flight of Dreams\\". Suspenseful and laced with erotism, \\"Boy Toy\\" is a must read. Mr Craft, please do not let us wait too long for the 7th book.	2003-01-22

Kirith Kirin is his first effort in fantasy and he has once again proven his talents. Kirith Kirin surpasses my expectation.

US	38967405	R2EZHCL1QLANX4	0758203233	5771776	He's The One	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Wonderfully addictive!	Finished it in one sitting as the story is addictive and both a comfort and a joy to read. I am delighted that the characters from \\"It had to be you\\", Mr Beck's previous effort, are featured in this story, implying that \\"He's the One\\" is a sort of sequel to \\"It had to be you\\". It is wonderful to find out more about Daniel and his relationship with Blaine, Jeremy and Martin. Adam the protagonist in \\"He is the One\\" is great but not as captivating as Daniel (the protagonist in \\"It had to be you\\"). Daniel's vulnerability, sensitivity and sadness as well as his struggle to find himself makes him a more beautiful character than Adam, who seems to have the easier life. Still Adam' strive to gain Jeremy's love is fun to read. However I have one complaint. I do not see the relevance of introducing Blythe, a \\"poor\\" girl with a rich gay father into the story. Every time the story turns to Blythe and her plight, I found myself hurrying through the words. I wish Mr Beck has concentrated more on the relationship development between Adam and Jeremy,  Jeremy's struggles to find himself and the domestic bliss of Daniel and Blaine. The story is colourful and laced with a touch of sadness. Daniel's and Martin's final acceptance of Ken's death and the burial of Ken is especially touching. A wonderful follow-up to \\"It had to be you\\" and I look forward to more from Mr Beck.	2003-01-19

Willie is a marvellous character, beautiful, loves make-up, warm, loving and simply irresistible.<br />His life as a harlot with a silver lining is touching and heart felt. The background of the story, depicting the slums, the wealthy, is richly crafted. Disappointed that the book is out of print but grateful that I have a copy. Because of Sweet Lavendar, Hunt is now one of my must-read authors.	2003-01-17

I just could not put it down and finished it in a day. Death's Head definitely ranks with Fortunes of War as my favorite Keegan books. Both protagonists, Jarrat and Stone, are intriguing, sexy and alluring, the perfect heroes of a great and solid science fiction. Their devotion and love for one another makes the book shines. The plot itself is sophisticated and races along brilliantly to an exciting finish. Not really as the future of the lovers are to be continued in Equinox, the sequel which I am desperately trying to get my hands on. Simply a great book not to be missed	2003-01-11

He is sexy, handsome, compassionate, devoted, smart and gay. Yes he is too perfect. But this is fiction and we all like our heroes to be perfect and beautiful. The relationship development between Jamie and Kent, a supposedly straight cop is romantic, putting a smile on my face at the end. The use of words, the dialogue and editing should have been better. But the plot is great, keeping me long into the night. The love story between Jamie and Kent, from comrades to lovers is beautiful and touching. And the pain as a caregiver, a role which first Jamie then Kent undertook, brought a warmth to my heart. I wish there is a sequel.	2002-12-02

I am disappointed that it is out-of-print because it should be enjoyed by all of us who are romantic at heart.

I finished it in one sitting. I just could not put it down. The mystery is engrosssing but it is also the endearing protagonist, Adrien English who keeps me glued to the book. Smart, sensitive and vulnerable, Adrien is an immensely likable character. One cares what happens to him as he becomes more and more entangled in the web. And the ending is great!	2002-11-29

The mystery races along like a thrilling roller coaster ride without a boring moment and Adrien is as witty, smart, endearing and sensitive as ever. One just loves to solve the mystery along with him. This book definitely has more depth as Lanyon also expands on the emotional side of Adrien's life. I found myself caring that Adrien's love for the \\"close-up\\" Jake is reciprocated. Let's hope it is as the series continues because Adrien certainly deserves a lover who will not leave him. At the end of the book, I just have to admit that I like the series because of the great character Mr Lanyon has created in Adrien English. Let's hope Adrien's 3rd book is not too far away.	2002-11-29

There is not one wasted word and I was in for a thrilling ride once I started. The mystery is taut, intense and captivating, the entangled romance sensitive and touching. The hero, Kyle, with a weak heart, is immensely likable and well potrayed. It is a rarity that a character could stand up so well in short mystery novel but Kyle does. Kyle finally accepting the loss of his father and the revelation of a half brother he would never have a chance to acknowledge gives a touch of melancholy to the story. Definitely one of my favourites.	2002-11-27

I am not disappointed. Great science fiction/fantasy with romance between same sex, in particular men, is rare. And I am pleased and delighted that Mr Donaghe has added a promising series to this rarity. The main characters, Jeru and Eril are lovers and soul mates. But there is no erotic sex scence. Their love making or more correctly bonding is abstract, delving into the mingling of their souls and essence, resulting in the joining and enhancemenet of their minds , strengths and souls. In Cinatis, Mr Donaghe has created an amazing world split into two types of humans/beings. You have the ones who live freely and close to nature while endowed with incredible abilities. And on the other hand, you have those slaves to conservatism and bigotry living with the mechanics of science. The struggle between these two races, the evils of a power hungry individual and Jeru desperately trying to come to terms with his growing power and responsibilities set the theme of the first book of a promising series. The only shortcoming I find is the lack of depth of character in Jeru and Eril which Mr Donaghe succeeded so beautifully with Joel and Tom in the Common Son. On the other hand this is a long series and I hope Mr Donaghe will add beauty to his two main characters and have them shine like Alex and Seregil in the \\"Nightrunner\\" series and Cal and Pell in the \\"Wraeththu\\". Looking forward to Volume two of Cinatis which I pray is not too far away.	2002-11-26

Mark is sensitive, mature and sexy. The mystery is fast paced and suspensful enough to hold the reader.

The dialogue is simple, at times hilarious, yet totally engaging. The relationship development between the reluctant hero and his adorable lover is a joy to read. A wonderful and amazing debut! Let's hope the second book is coming soon.	2002-11-08

The side characters are a joy to identify with. The author does such a great job in his description of New York gay and drag queen life that it is convincing, a joy to read yet touching and sad. The only critism I have is the love story of Danial and Blaine is a trifle short. But then it may be because I wished the book could have been thicker. I will definitely buy the second book, \\"He is the One\\" by Mr Beck...	2002-10-25

It is more terrifying than Salem's Lot and definitely more alluring and bewitching than Anne Rice's Vampire Series. Lost Souls was written in 1992 but till today still transcends most contemporary horros in terms of plot and characters. Lost Souls shines with its own unique emotional intensity that most contemporary horrors sadly lack. Brite's Vampires are unique personalities and she did such a brilliant job describing and justifying their lusts that I sympathize with them - haunted Christian, amoral Zillah, mindless Molochai and Twig and of course Nothing who has to learn to live with his aloneness among his kind. I was hoping for a better ending for Nothing but I guess Brite knows best. Ghost is of course my favorite character and I seldom have any in horrors. I will remember Ghost because of his love for Steve, his care for Nothing and Anne and his genuine goodness and vulnerability. I only with there is more of Lost Souls but one is always wistful when a book is as great as Lost Souls... Lost Souls will remain my favorite as long as I continue to read...	2002-09-02

If I have not read Fortunes of War earlier, I will definitely give Ice, Wind and Fire 5 stars.<br />Not as great as Fortunes of War but still an enjoyable and a delightful read, mostly because both Alex and Greg are such adoring characters. It is easy to be engrossed with their adventure which is fast paced. However I find the ending disturbing with Greg raped by one of the scoundrels. Perhaps it's because I like both Alex and Greg and just hate to have something so terrible happening to either of them. Still, it's a delightful and colourful adventurous romance.	2002-09-02

I love Drawing Blood and Lost Souls, two brilliantly written sensual horrors by Ms Brite. But I fail to stomach Exquisite Corpse. The macabre details do not frighten me, if anything it's overboard. I regret to say Ms Brite went over the edge with this horror. I fail to appreciate all the rich details of cut-up bodies splashed in blood driving sexual lusts. I always find it hard to like a book if I cannot sympathize with the main characters and Exquisite Corpse  main characters, being cold psychopaths, are just plain revolting. I hope Ms Brite will not continue to explore this type of nauseating horror.	2002-08-26

The story is harsh, stark brutal yet flows like an exquisite poetry. Rarely has a story made me wished the author could be kinder to his characters. The torment suffered by Danny, his mama and his siblings due to his abusive alcoholic papa just tears at my heart. The fact that Danny and his little brother, Groove, were haemophiliacs just made the story bleaker, with no happiness in sight. The ending was not tragic but still leaves a hollowness in my heart. Winter Bird must surely by Grimsley best work.	2002-08-22

I read Winter Birds some time back and was discomforted somewhat by its tragic bleakness. I am very pleased that Grimsley has continued with Danny's life in Comfort and Joy. This is a beautiful book about two men's love for one another, their bond ultimately strong enough to achieve what they really wanted despite all the odds against them. I am just glad that Grimsley gave a happy ending to Danny's painful life. Grimsley writes from his heart, his words soulful and heartfelt. His characters shine, each one with a purpose in this beautiful story. Yes the story was a comfort and a joy to read.	2002-08-22

It's just so easy to flow with the story and to feel for Mark as he endures confusion, suffering, rejection and pain as a result of coming out to his friend and family. But at the end there is hope as Mark finds love with Andrew, which is a great bridge to \\"Outside In\\", the sequel. Stuart, you are a gifted writer and I have enjoyed reading Outcast.	2002-08-16

Outside in is more soulful and sincere. It is a beautiful love story of two people who truly love each other. By alternating between Mark's and Andrew's narration, the story shines, often overwelming in its openness. After so much soul searching, it is just great to have Mark and Andrew together in the end. I have to admit to my weakness. I actually peeped at the last page when things began to go sour for the two lovers. Stuart, thank you for another beautiful book. Please don't let us wait too long for your 3rd novel.	2002-08-16

Nightswimmer is that. It is a powerful story of gay life in New York with characters you could easily empathize and fall in love with. It is a beautiful, at times hearbreaking story of love lost, ensuing pain and love found again. Olshan writes from his heart. The emotions just flow from the fist sentence and never let go. Often, I found my eyes moistening and I have to stop reading and return to the page before to recapture the overwelming moment again. I love this book.	2002-08-15
US	38967405	R19JYSHKP8645J	0965834565	59846099	Stealing Sacred Fire	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	A captivating gothic dark fantasy trilogy	I would like to review the Fallen Angels trilogy (STP,SHB,SSF) here. I finished the trilogy in 3 days because the series is addictive despite some of its shortcomings. Stalking Tender Prey (first book) is brilliant once you overcome the rather slow pace in the beginning. STP has all a perfect gothic dark fantasy should have and it is not for those with high moral standards. Its hero (PO) is a disturbing yet alluring amoral character whom you either dislike or care for. I find myself doing the later and the transformation of PO from a demonic character in the first book to almost a god of love in the 3rd book is mesmerizing. The second book delves into the usual good versus evil fantasy realm and hence to me the weakest of the trilogy but still an engrossing read. The concept of the 3rd book, transformation of a divine king in flesh to the ultimate Messiah of mankind, would be a challenge for any writer. But Storm delivers because she is gifted and writes from her heart. Her alternate view of Christianity and salvation is fascinating and almost believable. But like all Storm's books her ending tend to be rushed with all her fascinating views cramped into a few pages. I love the Wraeththu trilogy and of course tend to compare any of Storm's books to it. The Fallen Angel series is not as great but this dark fantasy is still too good to be missed.	2002-08-14

But the story itself is suspenseful, engrossing and at times heart breaking. However I am giving 4 stars and not 5 stars because I never like vague ending which to me is the flaw of the whole story. Maybe it would have been a better ending if the author has just left out the afterward. Overall the book is brilliantly written. The emotions just flow and I found myself feeling for Gabriel, a lonely, insecure and unhappy man past his prime seeking for acceptance from his father and love. Did he finally find love and solace through talking with Peter/Peter's mother? The story seems to suggest so. Jess, Gabriel's 10 year lover who left him, is a fascinating character too. Jess may have Aids but he wants to live and that in itself is beauty and strength. A must read despite the ending.	2002-08-08

It has everything a gothic romance should have and much more. Dark secrets, alluring isolation in a mansion by the sea, frightening twists and turns, sensual love story, tormented and passionate heroes doomed yet saved in the end. A well described era in New York with fascinating characters you could cheer for. I wish there is more of this in contemporary friction.	2002-08-07

Well, this has been an enjoyable past week for me as I finished the 3 books of Nightrunner series. However I did regret buying<br />them at the end of Traitor's Moon because I have a dreadful feeling that the 4th book may never be written. And this will be a pity because the 3rd book is a solid bridge for more plot and character development. Lot's of loose ends - What exactly is Alec's heritage ? Thero's destiny ? Development of the raging war which threatens to engulf Seregil and Alec as they returned to Skala? Right, Miss Flewelling mentioned in her 3rd book that this is not a trilogy. But she left the series and started another trilogy which is focused on the ancient Skala Queen Tamar, aeon before the world of Nightrunner series. I am disappointed she did that because it meant if she ever returned to a 4th book of Nightrunner it will be published probably in 2005 or 2006. Christ ! I thought the Wheel of Time is the worst!<br />Traitor's Moon is not as fast moving as the first two but the characters development is more fascinating and engrossing. The characters mature before our eyes. We see Seregil coming to terms with himself which I find touching. Alec as devoted to Seregil as ever. The bond between Seregil and Alec shines and these 2 soul mates have become my favorite characters in fantasy series after Cal and Pell in the \\"Wraeththu\\" series. The side characters are also a rewarding read, Thero's potential to be a great and wise wizard, Beka's love for an Aurenfaie. Sigh ! I just wish Miss Flewelling has just adhered to the development of this series.	2002-08-05

Delightful, often humourous and rich in characters this is fantasy at its best. I dread fantasy series which goes on forever like the Wheels of Time. Hence I scanned through the reviews of the 3rd book before I decided to buy the series. Glad that I did. It was pure joy reading Luck in the Shadows. The story is so well written that your imagination just runs wild with each scene, each paragraph. Thank you Ms Flewelling for such a joyful read.	2002-07-31

A combination of Stephen King and Anne Rice at their best could not have produced a better material than Drawing Blood.<br />I was hooked from the first page and was just imprisoned by the story of our tormented lovers, Zach and Trev.

I have never enjoyed a horror more. Thank you Miss Brite for a magnificent read.	2002-07-29

It only took a day because I could not put it down when I started yesterday morning. I just have to find out what happen to Joel and Tom next and so I just continue reading..reading...Joel and Tom are such beautiful young men that you just cry and cheer for them as they overcome all odds to be together. Their love for each other is so heart felt that you know they just have to be together. The side characters, Doughlas and Eva are great too but one wonder if parents will be that supportive if they find out about Joel's love when Joel is their only son. However this is a friction and should have brightness, happiness and hope in it. Personally I dread tragedies and try to avoid books which give you just that. A beautiful love story and I just wish to keep reading about Joel and Tom. Donaghe, thank you for creating Joel and Tom.	2002-07-24

This theme may be as old as time but still held an alluring fascination. Marrying Tom starts off brilliantly but fails to deliver a quarter way through the book. The development of the relationship between Daniel and Tom could be handled much better. More passionate and soul searching perhaps! Tom remains a shadow throughout the story. I am just frustrated that the author did not attempt to delve more into Tom's feelings for Daniel. Tom must surely sees alot in Daniel to be attracted to him. Tom is 16 and Daniel is 13. But Tom's emotions is not analysed at all. However the ending is quite good, when Daniel's father has to analyse his son feelings for Tom. I do not care about the background plot of the struggle between our heroes and the gansters - too much emphasis! I just wish Geraci could have place more effort on the emotions development between Daniel and Tom.	2002-07-23

It is so good that it prompted me to acquire all other Keegan's books which are available. Sadly none has come close to Fortunes of War. I do not care for the Spain vs England background. It is the story of the two lovers which gripped me and held me till the end. Our two lovers are such likable beautiful young men, their characters solid and almost real. When they were forced to be separated I felt a tug at my heart and just had to keep on reading until 3 in the morning to savor their reunion. Their love for each other is lusty, breathless yet tender and touching. I am a straight woman and have not touched a romance novels for years. However Fortunes of War has become one of my top ten favorites. I hope the book will be savored by a wider audience and not just men in love with each other.	2002-07-19

Who can ever forget these exquisite beings...The story grips you from the 1st page and just doesn't let go. I was hooked so badly that I took a day off from work to finish the 3rd book. However towards the last quarter of the 3rd book I just felt betrayed by Storm because she could have just done it much better and this would have been a read and reread enthralment. It was as if Storm lost interest towards the end of the story and just wished to finish it for the sake of finishing it or is the editor trying to limit the number of pages...Is there an unabridged version ?<br />However because of the beauty of the 1st, 2nd and 1/2 of the 3rd book I still rate the complete story 5 stars. Glad that the 3 books are combined into one and I have orderd a copy for a friend because I just could not lend him my copies. To all would be readers : please do not be deterred by the 700 over pages of the 3 in 1 copy. Believe me it is a spellbinding read and made one wishful for more...	2002-07-18
