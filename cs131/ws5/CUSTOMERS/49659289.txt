It's funny, it's light-hearted and most of all, it's entertaining. It should make the reader think, but it's too funny to take any of the content serious. It's a brief \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to Popular End Times.\\" Douglas Adams would be proud of the grammatical and societal play. I read it in about two hours and it was worth every second. I had a great time with with Wilson's obvious joy in writing and playing with words.<br /><br />Debate all you like about spiritual license to mock or jest or poke fun or whatever you like, just enjoy the title above. Have an antihistamine or bottle of Jolt Cola and enjoy. This book is not the end of Christianity. If you're worried about someone attacking your end-times convictions, buy a new bumper sticker and pray. You'll be OK.	2004-11-25

Perhaps one of the more bizarre \\"true to life\\" events in this title is the description of torture and abuse depicted early in the book. There are numerous times throughout the book that one might confuse headlines from Drudge with the fictional content of Memorial Day. It really is uncanny!<br />Style: Mr. Flynn's style is smooth with easy transitions. Not always \\"fast,\\" but always compelling and interesting throughout the story line. I would compare his style with his earlier works, but there is a noted maturity with the last two. The stories are not hurried as some authors breeze through their works.<br />Recommendation: He reads like Clancy on detail and plot. He reads like Grisham in descriptive drama. He captivates like Dan Brown.<br />I hope this helps you make a better decision. I hope you enjoy this title as much as I did.	2004-05-12
US	49659289	R1D2I92HNLNM06	0875521800	825496699	The Gospel According to Joseph Smith: A Christian Response to Mormon Teaching	Books	5	7	13	N	N	A brand new argument unlike other books on the LDS!	One of the key points of this book is to demonstrate that if a religious or philosophical system has, as its foundation, a god who was once a man (as the LDS system does), that system cannot support absolutes in philosophy, theology or personal living.  The author begins by demonstrating that the official LDS position, citing only LDS \\"prophets\\" and the \\"Standard Works,\\" is that the Christian God was actually once a man as you and I.  The author then proceeds to point out other doctrines which spring from this rather odd LDS doctrine.  In a later chapter, it is all tied together to show that \\"God's moral laws are not eternally binding if He is growing in knowledge [as the LDS claim].  If God came to a time when He was more complete than He was in the past, He is not perfect in learning.  What is the level to which He must come in order to say of Him, 'He knows all things'?...If the god of the Book of Mormon is still progressing to some degree or another, there may be morality issues that he has not resolved [as the author shows the LDS have a problem with] or even learned.\\"  So the god of the LDS Church cannot give morally binding laws.  Interesting thesis although there is much more in this book to comment on, I like this chapter the best...	2002-02-28
US	49659289	R2X4BA01PYB8A9	188576751X	629464096	Federal Husband	Books	5	51	59	N	N	(A not-so) Quick Review	The books thesis:  To be a truly Christian husband is to love one's wife  as Christ loves His Church.<br />How does Wilson undertake his task?<br />First,  he points the reader to a definition of &quot;federal headship&quot; and  the covenantal language of relationships which are based in Christ.  An  interesting point that Wilson makes is that many times, when husbands have  marital difficulties with their wives, the men are quick to say &quot;It's  her fault.  She just isn't a Biblical wife&quot; (or some variation of  blaming the wife).  But as a Federal Husband, the man is ultimately  responsible for all sinful activity in the house and cannot blame any in  his house for any shortcomings.<br />The second section deals with the  pitfalls of husbandry.  The chapter basically covers the responsibilities  of husbands &quot;as well as some of the common sins which husbands  frequently commit.&quot;  Wilson deals with caring for the &quot;conjugal  relations, provision of clothing and provision of food.&quot;  He also  details the respect due to a wife/mother and the husbands role in godly  parenting, what it means to treat your wife like a lady and the role of the  husband in his occupation.<br />The third section is really, really good.  Wilson takes on the masculinist, traditionalist, egalitarian and feminist  views of family and headship by posing the hierarchical/Biblical view.  He  makes the case that women are not to submit to men &quot;generally,&quot;  nor or women subservient to men.  She has a duty to her husband to provide  help and submit (but only to him).  Women do not have a duty to  &quot;submit&quot; to just any person.  &quot;Submit&quot; is handled in  more detail within the book for those of you who may be a little upset  right now.<br />Next Wilson discusses feminine beauty...in the form of a  pregnant wife.  Pregnancy is honorable, a glory to the mother and is  altogether lovely.  Other matters are discussed which would simply take too  long to comment on.<br />Does the thesis match the content of the book?  Yes.  To be a Federal Husband entails much of the substance of Doug Wilson's  material.  And there is really more in this book that is worthwhile I  really can not adequately comment on all of it here.<br />Please get this book  and enjoy it as much as I have.to comment on.<br />Does the thesis match the content of the book?

Sex, sex, sex.  Oh, and more sex.<br />Why, you ask?  It's  disturbing to know the severity of unfaithfulness toward one's wife and it  should have never been written because it's not easy owning up to  dishonoring one's spouse.<br />This book is excellently written.  The style is  smooth and the outline is fluid.  Doug Wilson once again writes in a style  that is easy to digest, follow and research his points by referring back to  the authoritative standard from which he argues, namely, the Bible.<br />The  chapters:  lust and pornography, fornication, adultery, divorce,  prostitution, rape, polygamy, sodomy, masturbation, celibacy, sexual  solutions, questions and answers and sexual glory.<br />This book is really  not intended for women.  It is much too directly addressing shameful areas  of a man's life that fall short that dishonor his wife.<br />I really can't  even get into the subject matter of the book other than to say that Wilson  makes points in this book that every Christian man should seriously  consider and contemplate.<br />Please don't misunderstand...this book is not  crude or indecent.  It is Biblical.  It is instructional.  But it does  handle many topics which only Dr. Ruth has dared to tread.  And that's a  point Doug Wilson brings up:  The Christian must take pleasure in his wife,  with his wife, not according to society's standard of fulfillment, but of  the Scriptural instruction on true enjoyment.<br />It's about avoiding the  problem areas of dishonoring one's wife and sinning against her.  It's  about the glory of the bed.  It's about the gifts of God and how to enjoy  them more, Biblically.<br />Wow.  Good stuff.	2000-08-09

My history classes were immersed in the depths of Lincoln worship.  I knew the reason for the Civil War:  Abolition of slavery...I would not be easily swayed.<br />Until I read  this book.<br />Before my reaction, a brief note on the style:  This book has  excellent primary source documentation.  It draws not only from Antebellum  but Reconstructionist writings.  Not just North, but also South.  Not just  U.S., but also foreign.  Not just political, but military and civilian as  well.  This is a well-rounded historical presentation of the events  surrounding the Civil War.<br />More on technique:  The bad stuff.  The only  negative criticism that I have is that not all subordinate assertions are  documented.  The major themes are well presented and end-noted, but  arguments supporting those major themes are not well established.  That's  it.  That was the only bad thing I have to say.<br />Well not really.  I have  a lot of bad stuff to say about Lincoln's misbehavior, lack of military  ethic, civilian atrocities, theft of personal property, imprisonment of the  political opposition in the North, fixed elections, disallowance of Free  Speech, constitutional negation (the trampling of all Amendments), invasion  of a foreign country, forfeiting State's &quot;sovereign right&quot; to  govern themselves, suspension of due legal process and ethnic  cleansing.<br />Lincoln even tried to arrest the Chief Justice of the Supreme  Court for publishing an opinion that demonstrated Lincoln was in error for  suspending the right to trial.<br />Lincoln forced the South into their  situation.  For what purpose?  As Charles Adams demonstrates, it was for  not for the preservation of the Union, but the preservation of the Northern  economy (which would not exist if the South were a foreign nation).<br />If  you presently disagree with this summary of only a few of Adams' points,  please do get this title.

Of course, I never really knew anything specific about Amway or the founders of that organization...until I started reading about them in business journals and the Dunn and Bradstreet report  of stability.  The business community greatly respects the founders of  Amway.  They give away millions every year to charities.  They help their  community and society in general.  The best thing is, this book is designed  to show you what they did to get to where they are.<br />This title presents  an overview of the philosophy of the founders of one of the largest  privately owned companies in the US and the world.  They are successful  people who explain how one might be a success as well.<br />I've also noticed  that most of the negative reviews for this title do not address the content  of this title.  Whereas, those who enjoyed it comment on the content.  Interesting, wouldn't you say?<br />The book is written clearly while  maintaining the focus on encouragement and reaching one's goals.<br />Good  read even if you aren't saving money with Amway.  They have a sister  company called Quixtar.  Very similar philosophy and quality products.  Quixtar was founded in 1999 and is also privately owned.  This philosophy  works!	2000-06-13

If you have never heard of Postmillennialism, you probablydon't want to read this book.  Why?  Because it's the most clear andconcise explanation available on the topic.<br />Mathison presents an exegetical and historical overview of the expectation of the Gospel in this age.  Do the Scriptures indicate the demise of the Church or do they speak of the success of evangelism and the overpowering victory of the risen Christ?<br />You may disagree with some of the finer points depending on your current position...that's to be understood.  But please investigate this matter from an author (Mathison) who advocates the Postmil point of view.  If you've had enough of the &quot;they say&quot; method of scholarship, do get this book.<br />As a short appendix, Mathison also deals with the eschatological heresy which believes we are in the eternal state right now (hyper-preterism).<br />So, beware.  This title does a great job at clearly explaining the Biblical portrait of the purpose of the Gospel.<br />This book is a great place to start an investigation into Postmillennial thinking...	2000-06-06

Each chapter in every section has study questions that reinforce and help the reader gain a deeper understanding of  each section.  The foreword is written by RC Sproul.<br />Doug Wilson, Doug  Jones, Roger Wagner and David Hagopian have put together a well-rounded  presentation of the Reformed Faith.  As Roger Wagner, one of the authors,  states, &quot;the Reformed faith starts and stops with the sovereign and  gracious God who has revealed Himself in Scripture.&quot;  That's the focus  and starting point for every discussion in the book.<br />Many authors simply  complain about the condition of the Church.  Not these authors.  They  exercise terrific insights, give helpful direction and pastoral-theological  wisdom that really does encourage the student of Scripture.  Each message  is an example of compassion.<br />A short summary of the book from the book:  &quot;[God} is, and forever will be, preeminent in all things (Col.  1:18).&quot;  In all areas of life, God is primary and it is Him that we  glorify in all things.  Conversion, covenant, church and life, all things  are for Him and through Him.  The authors' theses are complete and clear.  Their goal was accomplished:  Why is Reformed theology such a good thing  (or is it)?<br />This title is recommended by:  RC Sproul, Jay Adams, E.  Calvin Beisner, James Montgomery Boice, D.

For those who have never heard that there are Christians who donot believe in a Kingdom offer 7-year pre-tribulational secret rapturenon-Lordship 3.5-calvinism position, this book is for you.<br />Mathison is clear and does not use terminology that only PhD's understand. Yes, there are Christians out there who reject dispensational theology as a modern theological invention that divides God's universal plan into two stages for two different people groups.<br />A very fine point that Mathison makes is not on eschatology...what you believe about God's plan for mankind and what you believe about the Church will determine where you land (dispensational or other).  This has nothing to do with &quot;dispensations,&quot; it has everything to do with the primary intent of Christ's first advent, the nature of the Church, the doctrines of salvation and God's plan for history.<br />I was hardcore dispy before reading this book...reading the Bible has never been so clear since I left that &quot;theological system.&quot; This book will shake the foundations of a dispy theological system.  If it doesn't, it will give you some serious matter for consideration.<br />The Scriptures do have a simple message...leave it up to folks to create a system of beliefs that not only divide Christians from fellowship with each other, but emphasizes wall charts of end-times fantasies that cannot be found at all in the Bible.  The air is so clear without the confusion of Dispensationalism.<br />This is a great book.  Challenge yourself to read Mathison's book and dispute it or join the ranks of those who have left Dispensationalism for the clarity of Scripture.	2000-06-06
