Being a librarian myself, I never thought I'd find a book that fit that particular description.  But Beinhart has managed to weave his mild-mannered librarian hero into a web of political intrigue filled with evil right-wing conspirators and provocative women.  Cudos to the author for making the librarians depicted interesting and sexy (even the one old woman librarian is revealed to have had a very active sex life in her younger days), not the usual stereotypes.  My only small problems with it are that it could have been shorter by about 75 pages, and that the election-based plot is so thinly veiled that he may as well have called the incumbent \\"Bush\\" instead of \\"Scott\\".  All in all, though a great read for anyone, not just librarians.	2004-09-15

I read this one several years ago on a recommendation.  I found it different from anything else I've read.  Funny without being cutesy, gritty in its own way without being overbearingly so.  And how many novels are set (a little bit, anyway) in East Newark NJ, a town of about eight square blocks across the Passaic River from Newark?  I love that attention to detail.  I still remember the ending vividly, which is more than I can say for a lot of crime novels.	2004-08-04

I'm tired of reading books and articles like this.  Stapinski is one of the worst of the lot; she seems to believe that the world is dying to hear everything about her life, her family, her career.

Aside from figuring out how the fake places correspond to the real ones, I got no enjoyment out of this book.  I found the writing pedestrian, at best, and the main character annoying and preachy.  Katz seems to think he's clever by setting the action in, say, a strip mall as opposed to a gritty urban setting.  It's really just tiresome.	2003-11-18

It reads like Waldman spent a few hours in a &quot;how-to-write-a-mystery-novel&quot; class and figured she'd get away with it since she's Michael Chabon's wife.  It's filled with dreadful, cliche-ridden plotting and characters and has an ending you can see coming a mile away.  She also panders to her readers.  I usually don't read books like this one (I gave her a chance because I like her husband's work) and, God willing, never will again.  Presumably, she was a good lawyer; maybe someday she'll do us a favor and go back to it.	2003-11-18

Just look at the intricate way he weaves the footnotes into the plot; he must have spent a lot of time researching.  As a librarian myself, I loved the plot, the setting, and the character of Eve Jablom.  Nice to see a librarian portrayed as young and attractive instead of old and austere.	2003-06-09

It seems a bit sad to me now in the wake of the Columbia tragedy (\\"I want to be an astronaut, a member of the crew\\" sounds somewhat different now), but that doesn't really affect little kids.  If you or your kids are space nuts, this is a good one to begin with.	2003-02-20

Though the illustrations captured the local color of JC, the plot is a mess.  Any mystery that hinges on repressed memory as a major plot devise is going to have problems.  It comes across as a stupid way to move things along.  Surely a writer of De Haven's abilities could have come up with something better.  This feels like he wrote it in an hour.	2002-11-04

Well-written and exhaustively in-depth look at every aspect of the four ex-Beatles solo careers.  This has all the info you could ever want on solo albums, tours, TV appearances, bootlegs, etc.  The only drawback is that I got so into it I was forced to buy all the solo records I hadn't already owned!	2002-10-07

In addition to being an excellent historian, Fleming's father was a ward leader under Hague, so Fleming had access to a lot of inside stories.  Due to Hague not leaving much of a paper trail, this may likely be the best bio we ever have on the man, though it's also worth tracking down Thomas Smith's THE POWERTICIANS.	2002-09-13

She blames the City for all of her own and her family's ills and basically says getting out of JC is a great achievement. I grew up in JC at the same time as Ms. Stapinski (I'm three years older than she is). I found the city to be a great place to be a kid, even in the 1970s. You could always find kids like yourself in such a diverse environment. If Stapinski and her family had so many problems, perhaps she should look within and not blame her environment. Sure, there was corruption in JC, but it was no worse than other American cities at the time. And, for Pete's sake, she lives in Brooklyn now--not exactly a bastion of civilized government.<br />What really bothered me in this book, though, was her claim that while many of her relatives were crooks, her father was honest--he may have taken home stolen goods occasionally, but everyone did that in Jersey City. My Dad was a blue collar worker in JC the same time Stapinski's was and he never stole a thing in his life. Her comment is an insult to many honest workers.<br />In a recent article in the New York Times Magazine, Stapinski claims that people muttered disapprovingly at her when she returned to JC for a funeral. She believes that this is because she had the strength to leave the city. What her ego keeps her from seeing is that people disapprove of her in Jersey City because she has painted such a negative portrait of the city only to further her writing career.<br />Instead of this one, I recommend Michael Patrick MacDonald's ALL SOULS. His story of growing up in South Boston is full of despair, joy, and hope. Unlike Stapinski, who fled from the problems she saw in JC, MacDonald still lives in Southie and devotes himself to making it a better place. That's a lesson Stapinski needs to learn.	2002-08-20

Believe me, McNally's book is going to be the definitive Dead book from now on.  Only Blair Jackson's GARCIA is in the same league.  Not only is the whole story of the band told, but it's told well and is a terrific read.  McNally is to be commended for concentrating on the band, their world, and their music without getting bogged down in their personal lives.  That's not the point here.  His decision to break the narrative flow with occasional interludes works, giving details on different aspects of the Dead's world that flesh out the story.  My only quibbles (and they're small ones) are these: I wish he had included more about Tom Constanten and Vince Welnick--they were both members of the band (if briefly) and deserve a little more attention.  And there is an occasional needless swipe at other artists like Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground (who did not hate their audience, as McNally claims).  But aside from that, a great tale well-told.	2002-08-13

I've read his books on Bob Marley, Brian Wilson, and now James Taylor (plus his book ROCK STARS, which has the best interview ever with Pete Townshend).  They are easily the best books on each of these artists and I always learn far more about the men and the cultures from which they came than I thought I would.  It's sad that White died so young this year; his work will be missed.<br />This book on Taylor tells the whole story of JT's life and career, with respect but with few punches pulled.  The input of James himself, plus family and friends helps flesh out the portrait.  JT's important but often neglected place in the pantheon of popular music is firmly established here.  I could have done with a little less of the 400 years of Taylor family history, but it does add an interesting background to the story.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-12

It is a dark, brooding tale of a thief and his cohorts in early 1950s Philadelphia &amp; Atlantic City.  It reminded me a lot of Jim Thompson's work from the same period.  Not a fast-moving story, but at the same time it's hard to break away from.  A good look at the psychological costs of a life of crime.	2002-05-30

A tightly written crime novel, it is interesting for its Vineyard scenery at a time years before the island was the tourist mecca that it is now.  A lot of fun for those familiar with the place today.  There's a lot more to McBain than the 87th Precinct books.	2002-05-22

Vergara's book is one of the few to show the building from its construction to its demise.  Having grown up across the Hudson in Jersey City, I was particularly moved by the wealth of photos from the west side of the river.  I remember seeing the buildings go up and marking their progress by how high the yellow tarp around each tower was.  A beautiful book.	2002-05-17

But I still keep going back to this one.  It is unlike a lot of other crime novels in that it forces its heroes into situations where they cannot act heroically.  The ending is an absolute stunner.  The only other crime book which hit me this way is DOWN BY THE RIVER WHERE THE DEAD MEN GO by George Pelecanos. Extremely highly recommended.	2002-05-17

This book, by the late Randy Shilts, is an exception.  Shilts was a great writer, able to take a variety of facts and put them into readable passages (his &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; is another good example of this).  Harvey Milk and the San Francisco of the 1970s come to life in this book.  The tragedy of Milk's assassination and its aftermath are rendered in gripping detail.	2002-04-24

Robert Palmer was one of this country's best music writers and a man who died way too young.  This book is not his best (that'd be DEEP BLUES), but he does an excellent job of capturing the broad history of rock 'n' roll.  He discusses what led up to that crucial moment at Sun Studios in 1954 (I don't think he's trying to say that the music sprang full-grown from Elvis) and where the music traveled from there.<br />Bear in mind, however, that this book also served as a companion to a PBS special.  That it's able to stand alone without the visuals attests to its worth.  It badly deserves to be back in print.	2002-04-04

I don't read as much horror now, but wanted to revisit this one. It holds up surprising well. In fact, as an adult, I identify more with the Chowder Society members. Fear means something different as we get older, and this book seems to understand that. Don Wanderly's reactions to the events in Milburn are markedly different to the older men.<br />The movie version captured only a fraction of the book and is largely unsuccessful. It is worth seeing, though, for Fred Astaire's portrayal of Ricky Hawthorne. It was Astaire's last film and he is wonderful. It's especially fun to hear his character say that he can't dance!	2002-04-02

Responding to Mr. Sympson's comment below, I have to say that, when I was a young man, I was dazzled by Eliot's language. Now approaching middle age, however, I find him a bit cold. Auden, on the other hand, grows in my estimation every time I read him. His grasp of human emotion is second to none among 20th century poets.	2001-10-10
