Both authors even have three names, same as a serial killer, the ficticious author notes. On his first media tour interview, Harlan is confonted by a morning talk show host with a review, by the real newspaper, The Baltimore Sun, that describes Harlan's book book as \\"trite, poorly written and an unabashed yank of emotional strings.\\" So, in this case, Evans has written two accurate reviews for two books. There is little reason to pile on.    The only good news was that this was my first experience with a large type book, which made it easier to read this vapid story.

Blame it on advertising or the mainstream media. The word has lost much of its meaning. In the same way, landmarks in the eastern United States, with the word \\"Fort,\\" no longer carry the message of honor attached to the men whose name identifies the fort, e.g., Washington, Lee. And two hundred thirty years ago, the word \\"heights\\" on a map meant something more than a developer's way of selling real estate. <br /> <br />David McCollough is a marvelous storyteller, owing in part to his choice of subjects: John Adams, Harry Truman, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Johnstown flood. Even more helpful to the reader is the memory of his ubiquitous, distinctive voice, narrating important stories of our day, usually for the PBS audience. This resonant voice comes across in \\"1776\\" as well, and he gives real meaning to words like \\"fort,\\" \\"heights'\\" and \\"revolutionary.\\" \\"1776\\" is basic Revolutionary War civics 101. McCollough catalogs the first year of what would be an eight-year war, using most of the book to describe the engagements around Boston in March, New York in August, and Trenton in December. The first two engagements show the sharp reversal of fortunes of the two sides and the steady maturation of a relatively untested George Washington. The battles around these two critical cities also show the value of naval power, the need for good intelligence, the importance of defensible, strategic positions, and the key role of leadership by officers. Even Trenton, famous for its \\"Washington crossing the Delaware\\" image, had an obvious if low-key naval component, and was much less of a poor defense by drunk Hessians on Christmas than a brilliant move by Washington, one that restored rapidly declining faith in the fortunes of the continental army. In all three cases, innovative leadership and resilient work in the lower ranks carried the day. Unfortunately, around New York, the British won the day but, even then, Washington maneuvered his way out of looming catastrophe. McCollough also seems to recognize the hand of God in all of this, in the critical shifts in the weather, from fog covering the crossing back from Brooklyn, to ill winds that kept the British Navy at bay. <br /> <br />There are numerous portraits of the key American and British figures, from kings to colonels. McCollough makes great use of original letters, notes and other contemporaneous correspondence, even in the stilted English of formal communication of the day, to bring old stories into the present. This is no Hollywood production. If there is a weakness, it is this attention to detail and contemporaneous documents. Three maps, drawn at the time of the battles, show how military strategists saw the war. However, the maps are tiny, almost impossible to read, and leave out some of the details described in the text, either by an absence on the map or battles occurring \\"off the map\\". <br /> <br />An important read for any American citizen, starting in high school civics. Also, I've been told, the book on tape version is well worth the listen. Regardless of the medium, \\"1776\\" is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

The last book I read that had a title, subtitle, and sub-subtitle confused me and that seems to have happened again. Morrow offers three titles, labels, or come ons: \\"The best years of their lives,\\" \\"Learning the secrets of power,\\" and \\"Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon in 1948.\\" I'm still not sure which one is the `real' title. The three concepts each had promise. These are three American icons, both loved and despised. The year - 1948 - happened to be a pivotal year, not just for these three, but also for the rest of America. The hot war was  cold, and the cold was getting hot, and the Baby Boom was booming. Opportunity and optimism seemed unlimited, especially to young, power hungry politicians like Nixon, Johnson and Kennedy. <br /> <br />The disappointment I felt was that none of the promises implied in the three labels for the book earned much attention from the author. Morrow tells us more about Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss than Richard Nixon, about George Smathers and Joe Kennedy than Jack Kennedy, and Coke Stevenson and Lady Bird rather than Lyndon Johnson. If these three presidents of the future learned any secrets of power in 1948, the secrets remain undiscovered by me. Maybe I'm not reading well enough into the analysis. Morrow waxes poetic about eerie parallels in lives, like Lana Turner and Richard Nixon, notes the impact of all the dead, diseased and disturbed relatives and their effects on the three main characters, and offers an encyclopedia of armchair psychoanalysis and cultural sidebars, mixing religion, crucifixion complexes, politics, Hollywood, and Albert Kinsey. Theories, not secrets. <br /> <br />It is not even clear how -if at all - that 1948 was the best year of each man's life. The attempt to link these three lives to the Hollywood film reminded me that 1948 was the best year of \\"our\\" lives, so I guess all Americans had a pretty good year in 1948, especially war veterans. But Johnson was not much of a veteran (Johnson's Silver Star makes John Kerry's Purple Hearts look like Medals of Honor) and Kennedy, well Morrow acknowledges that the PT-109 story was more of a court martial offense than the makings of a heroic legend. Even Nixon was more of a Mr. Roberts than any battle-scarred veteran. These men had more to be embarrassed about than proud when it comes to war service, but politics makes legends out of molehills and Morrow provides us with three moles. Morrow's tangential summary description of the role, character and accomplishments of George Marshall makes these three men look like the three blind mice. <br /> <br />Reading on, looking for integration or even a consistent narrative, the pages slipped away, leaving me scratching my head. When a 300-page book has only four chapters, maybe that should have been a sign. The stories jump all around, often into Jack Kennedy's sex life and his coarse way of rationalizing his need for sex, and Morrow seems to obsess about dark secrets, homosexuality, suicide, drunkenness and bankruptcy. These may be secrets a lot of people would like to keep a secret, but they don't tell me anything about \\"the secrets of power.\\" <br /> <br />Stephen Ambrose (Nixon), Thomas Reeves (Kennedy) and Robert Caro (Johnson) are much better chroniclers of the more complete, factual, historic versions of the lives of thee important figures, including 1948.	2005-09-10
US	52891206	RQZ6KMOG6NCNU	0895260409	669917331	Flat Tax Revolution: Using a Postcard to Abolish the IRS	Books	3	128	167	N	N	Good start but the final plan is neither flat nor fair	This 'simple' tax seems pretty complicated. Let me see if I get this right.    Forbes inadvertently calls for two federal income tax rates: a progressive tax on income (after personal deductions) and continuation of the regressive social security tax, also a federal tax on income. To see the problem, let's take a look at the prototypical (if also increasingly rare) two-parent, two-child family. Under Forbes's plan, their federal income tax rate changes, depending on the family's income. He starts by proposing exemptions, deductions, and tax credits, undercutting his claims that this is a \\"simple\\" flat tax and his argument that the whole point of a flat tax is to eliminate personal deductions, exemptions and the like. Then, below $46,165 a year, this family's effective federal income tax rate is zero. At an annual family income of $92,330, the effective or real tax rate it is half of Forbes' nominal 17% `flat' rate, because the family pays no taxes on the first $46, 165. And at $138,495, the rate is two-thirds of Forbes' nominal rate. You get the picture. The rate approaches the nominal 17% flat rate Forbes proposes, but never reaches it. This is called calculus, or approaching the nominal rate asymptotically. But it is not a flat tax. It is flat on the margin, but only for those who pay taxes, and with a $46,135 cut off, many families would pay no Forbes federal income taxes.    But wait! The Forbes `flat' tax isn't really fair either. On page sixty, right after Forbes proposes his \\"flat\\" 17% federal income tax rate and those exemptions and deductions), he decides to leave social security taxes out of the equation (\\"It does not supplant Medicare and social security taxes...\\"). Social security taxes are federal taxes on income, no matter how you slice it, lock-box it, or play with it. It is a federal tax on income. Back to that prototypic, four-person American family. In addition to Forbes' flat tax, this family will pay about 15% (including the \\"employer's share) onall of their income up to $90,000 (as of 2005), at which point basic social security taxes stop and the rate on income drops to about 3%.     So we have one progressive tax and another regressive tax. Put these two tax plans together - which is exactly what Forbes perhaps inadvertently does on page sixty - and you have the worst of all possible worlds, a middle class nightmare, Going back to that prototypical family and at $46,165 you add together rates of 0% (Forbes' \\"flat\\" rate) and 15% (social security, Medicare, Medicaid). Then they pay 17% plus 15% (a 32% marginal rate) on the income between $46,165 and $90,000. Above $90,000, the social security tax disappears, so the marginal rate drops back to about 20% for all income above $90,000. Worse, if this is a two-income family, with both adults earning $90,000, the social security tax on the family persists up through $180,000 in income. And no one ever pays the 17% tax rate on income!    The Forbes plan would also encourage employees to seek \\"non-income\\" perks, like health benefits, corporate apartments, company cars, uniforms, subsidized cafeterias, club memberships, and other benefits paid by the employer. Forbes also too quickly dismisses a national sales tax as regressive while ignoring the regressive social security tax. In fact, some targeted \\"sin\\" taxes on consumption are effective and -- at high enough rates -- able to dampen demand on consumption based on bad habits, e.g. smoking. Regressive taxes on unproductive or dysfunctional behaviors are laudable or at least worth considering. Some argue these sin taxes to be paternalistic, maternalistic, or simply moralistic without realizing that all tax plans have these three elements. Is taxing income any more or less moral or maternalistic than taxing consumption? Forbes' plan could perhaps fit on one small card because something significant is left off the card but not off your tax bill!    Am I missing something?	2005-09-01

The characters are much more human, if a little more sparsely drawn, than those in the \\"Code,\\" and the intrigue is better than the great leaps of faith required by \\"Code.\\" <br /> <br />Yet faith is what \\"Third Secret\\" is all about. Some of the sleights of hand, deceptions and plot twists are a bit murky, but the basic story hinges on a flawed priest (although it seems strange that he would claim to have gone twenty years without saying Mass) who, like almost every other featured character, has a troubled past and a struggle with faith. <br /> <br />This was a generally linear, straightforward, fast-paced read, with a relatively simple narrative and a few useful sojourns around time and Europe. Berry does not bring out the local color much beyond the pageantry and cloaks of the Vatican and the papacy, but the trips to Rumania, Bosnia and Germany provide a diverse backdrop for plot developments. <br /> <br />An early attempt to excommunicate a heretic priest is a bit of a sideshow, a distraction, but he provides a link back to our protagonist's past and, in the end, the heretic appears to be more correct than the conniving cardinal from Florence and his bi-sexual henchman also clothed in priest's garb. By the end of \\"Secret,\\" no priest will look the same to you again, at least not as some distant spiritual figure. At least the transgressions are a welcome relief from the pedophilia and child abuse cases capturing public attention today. <br /> <br />The \\"secret\\" of \\"Secret\\" strikes at the very the foundations of the church. For me, the revelation is a wee bit too all-encompassing as a major critique of widely accepted church dogma, a bit too convenient and powerful. But that is what makes the secret worth hiding. In some respects, it would be nice to have a miraculous revelation both simplify and clarify some of the difficulties of keeping the faith.	2005-08-23
US	52891206	R3IU0ZM23XRSPY	1594200459	697870179	The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time	Books	3	179	197	N	N	One Harvard professor's attempt to solve poverty	A wonderful thesis. The initial tone and first-hand accounts and analyses (Chapters 1-4) are great. Sachs' first few chapters read like Thomas Friedman, only Sachs publishes in journals and Friedman publishes in the New York Times. And Friedman has a few best sellers. Sachs is a very smart, accomplished, compassionate economist. <br /> <br />Sachs tries to provide some context. He seems to have personally saved first Bolivia (Chapter 5), then Poland (Chapter 6), then Russia (Chapter 7), then China (Chapter 8), and then India (Chapter 9), not from poverty, but from the mistakes of (American) foreign policy, greedy bankers, and the IMF. He always seems to get it right and they're wrong. He decries their solutions in favor of his own: demand debt forgiveness. <br /> <br />Then Sachs shifts into using his economic, statistical, and networking skills to propose solutions to eradicate poverty. His fundamental argument is that the rich countries need to give more money to the poor countries, and he seems pretty angry about the lack of compassion, especially from the United States, for the world's poor. Perhaps Sachs could start with his home institution, Harvard. This university has an almost egregious endowment in excess of $22 billion, pays its top fund manager $50 million a year, and employs Andrei Shleifer who \\"was discovered by the U.S. government to be making personal investments in Russia at the same time that he was on a U.S. government contract to advise the Russian leadership on privatization.\\" (p. 144) This privatization effort, as Sachs reports, sold $100 billion in assets for $1 billion. Sachs thinks that we should then forgive the Russian government its debts. Rather than forgive debt, why not transfer some of that $100 billion to the creditors and not to political cronies favored by the government? <br /> <br />Look at China. Sachs commends their two thousand years of \\"a workable model of political organization\\" and their \\"remarkably little internal violence,\\" only to show how China spent the last thousand years watching its GDP decline from 120% to 5% of western European GDP and employing policies, even recently, where \\"tens of millions of deaths resulted.\\"  Starving tens if not hundreds of millions of your own people is internal violence. Wiping out 95% of your GDP advantage is hardly a \\"workable model\\". And now, after a thousand years of self-imposed misery, China has climbed back from 5% to 10% of western European per capita GDP and their economic development is seen as a triumph. And Sachs laments how under British rule Indian GDP per capital grew at a 0.2% rate from 1870 to independence in 1947; compared to China's self-managed decline, British rule might be commended. <br /> <br />Sachs disdains the \\"money down the drain\\" argument (p. 310) against foreign aid, an argument that trillions have already been given, but counters it with an annual per capita expenditure calculation that doesn't counter the \\"money down the drain\\" argument. He describes Hernando DeSoto's \\"Mystery of capitalism\\" argument for deeds and titles to land for the poor as \\" a single factor ... to explain single-handedly the failures of development.\\" (p. 321) Yes, economic development is more complicated than that, but isn't this a better, enduring, sustainable start than the \\"mystery\\" of one-time debt forgiveness? And DeSoto focuses on what Sachs ignores: self-help, or micro enterprises, as a grass roots alternative to repeated, well-intentioned but top heavy governmental interventions. <br /> <br />Sachs cites a study (pp. 322-23) that concludes that African men have fewer sex partners than men in Brazil and Thailand, to show that morals are not the cause of African AIDS, citing migrant workers and the lack of circumcision as possible explanations, but he does not seem to want to assign a root cause for the widespread prevalence of AIDS in Africa, moral or migratory. But the best cure for AIDS is prevention, not cheap AIDS drugs or foreign aid. And what does he think causes AIDS to spread in Africa? Dirty needles? Tattoo parlors? I once asked a Marshall Scholar applicant if she would consider adding an abstinence argument to her condom distribution AIDS prevention program in Central America. She declined, saying that she would not want to impose her morals on the people. It is a matter of biology, not morality, but sometimes moral admonitions can solve biological problems. People need information more than money, prevention more than drug treatments. <br /> <br />Sachs lauds the west, especially Britain, for acting against its own self-interest to abolish the slave trade (pp. 361-62) but fails to note the presence of slavery in Africa and Asia today. He wants to \\"rescue the IMF\\" (p. 366), the same organization that for most of the book he sees as unfit to deal with the debt crisis (see John Perkins' \\"Confessions of an economic hit man\\"), but he offers no rescue plan. He concludes by trying to dispel other \\"myths\\" (Chapter 16) and offering three pages (pp. 365-67) of argumentative platitudes, e.g., \\"redeem\\" the United States, which he claims is the world's \\"most feared and divisive country.\\" <br /> <br />But all is not lost. The Institute for International Economics has reported that world poverty fell from 44% of the global population in 1980 to 13% in 2000, its fastest decline in history. This result indicates that the United Nations main Millennium Development Goal (p. 211) -- reducing world poverty below 15 percent -- has already been met. Another Harvard professor, David Landes, provides a more thorough historical context and explanation in \\"The wealth and poverty of nations,\\" including the effects of culture, climate, and tropical diseases on poverty. C. K. Prahalad's \\"The fortune at the bottom of the pyramid\\" shows how basic business and marketing practices are lifting people out of poverty more than any government, NGO, or debt-forgiveness program. \\"The new heroes,\\" from the recent PBS series, funded in part by a foundation started by the founder of eBay, shows micro enterprises that work. Sachs shows that Hillary Clinton's take on the African proverb, \\"It takes a village,\\" doesn't seem to be working in African villages. I really wanted to love and recommend this book. A telling sign might have been when Sachs describes Kofi Annan as \\"the world's finest statesman.\\" (p. 205) Rather than just give poor countries fish (or recommend that poor countries tear up their bills for their fish), rich countries ought to teach people how to raise a diverse, sustainable economy.	2005-08-20

The two preceding Amazon reviews provide excellent insight as to the value of the book and the character of the men. <br /> <br />Homestead produced, in final count, thrity-one deaths. The original clash, in early July 1892, just outside of Pittsburgh, killed a small number of men. One Pinkerton guard brashly shot himself in the head in front of his colleagues stuck in the barge rather than fall into the hands of the strikers. Carnegie -- by most accounts -- felt betrayed by Frick's hard-nosed handling of the Homestead crisis. Carnegie insisted, especially after the deaths of Pinkerton \\"police\\" and strking workers -- that he would have just let the plant stay idle, wait the strikers out, and offer them no reason to fight. Carnegie wanted to be loved; he dreamed that a worker might even say, \\"If only you had been here, this would not have happended.\\" Frick would not have any of this. He had firm, well-entrenced ideas not only about his rights as a capitalist, but also in his skills and obligations as Carnegie's chief operating officer. <br /> <br />The book does best at constrasting these two men. In some respects they were very much alike. \\"Ruthless\\" is not too harsh a word to describe the manner in which they cut costs, built their networks of industries, and squeezed out minor players. They were the masters of the dominant network of the day, based on steel and rail. As entrepreneurs Carnegie may still have not found an equal, not even in Bill Gates, although there are some parallels in the lives and methods of the two men. Frick comes across more as the master implementer, less of the visionary that Carnegie appears to have been. Frick, tied most closely to the production of coke, was a little further down the industrial stream. <br /> <br />The final conflict was more of a clash of egoes, with both men realizing that their personal fortunes lie with a schism. When Frick did not get his way in the split of the wealth, after thinking he had Carnegie's commitment, he was never going to forgive Carnegie for stepping back from the deal. Carnegie, on the other hand, felt Frick tried to front for some unscrupulous buyers and, despite Carnegie's own ruthless tactics, found Frick's friends to be unsavory. Such a divide between two such men was perhaps inevitable. <br /> <br />The research is rich; the book is full of details. What it lacks, in this reviewer's mind, is the full color of the story, of the poverty and squalor of the working men, just as much the ricj splendor of the wealthy. The story moves quickly across the lives of the men as well as the birth of the industries that they helped to create. There are three stories here -- Carnegie, Frick, and Homestead -- requiring perhaps more than any one book can provide.	2005-08-14

His chapters, including \\"Hooking up,\\" \\"Emotional troubles,\\" \\"Is diversity working?\\" and \\"Fraternities and sororities under siege\\" offer some insight that comes together in the final chapter (\\"Improving the undergraduate experience\\"), but by then it is too late to make this book of real value or substance. The dust cover blurb from Hamilton's retired president should have offered me a hint of the superficial tone of the book, as Hamilton seems to be the real touch point for Seaman, not national college life. He briefly cites Indiana's Murray Sperber, who has done a much better job of illustrating the beer-and-circus mentality of rah-rah, big-name schools. As to a personal glimpse, while Seaman tried to live out the student role (tough to do when you're almost old enough to be their grandfather), Tom Wolfe's \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" covers much of the same ground - sex, frats, jocks, pressures - and brings it to life much better than does Seaman. <br /> <br />The first weakness if not outright bias of the book is the selection of great colleges (including Harvard, Dartmouth, Indiana, Wisconsin, California-Berkeley, and Virginia), but not representative of the nation's 15 million college students. Seaman slips into some mention of \\"second- and third-rate colleges\\" with little appreciation of the role they play in American university life. There is the smug conceit that Harvard is the leader for institutional change, but Seaman's work only remindedme of the adage, \\"You can always tell a Harvard man, you just can't tell him much.\\" <br /> <br />The second weakness stems from the selection of elite public and private schools. Seaman slips in a comment from a \\"third-rate\\" college president who notes that his students are too busy working part-time to get as drunk as the students at the elite schools. Seaman does apply some healthy skepticism to the Harvard \\"binge drinking\\" studies, but doesn't really offer useful analysis. What he seems to leave out of the equation is that these elite students have way too much time and money on their hands.  The students he profiles come across as spoiled rich kids, chafing under the scourge of the twenty-one year old drinking age. Seaman does note that Hamilton's three-person student life staff from his day has been replaced by a twenty-person professional corps, but he fails to realize that these elite schools have become extended summer camp for some of these students, a pleasant four-year holiday en route to careers on Wall Street. Yes, he does show some evidence that we'd be better off with a lowered age for drinking legally, but that is not the entire solution. <br /> <br />Praising somewhat Middlebury's \\"quad\\" living arrangement plans only made me see that this has all been done before. What Middlebury seems to be considering is exactly what my alma mater did thirty-five years ago. Again, the problem is that Seaman and others look to and expect leadership and innovation to come from these elite schools, when there is an even better argument for the opposite: small, troubled, financially stretched schools are more likely to be the most creative. <br /> <br />In the end, there is little about binge drinking or other excessive lifestyles in this book, and there is little here that a student is likely to hide from his or her parents. And, in fact, this may be the most \\"connected\\" student cohort we've ever had, given the plethora of technology on campus (again, another topicgiven some but not much attention here), but connected to what is the real question. Or, perhaps a better question: What are these parents who pay $40,000 a year for this holiday camp really think that their sons and daughters are learning? And do they really care? \\"Helicopter\\" parents or not, there are still too many parents who cough up the cash and then act surprised when they find that students slouch sleepily in 2000-seat lecture hall classes, sleep until noon, get arrested for all sorts of crimes and misdemeanors, and never have a conversation with a professor. The disconnection appears to be between parents and well-publicized college realities. <br /> <br />\\"Binge\\" may bring back some memories for aging alums and startle some nave parents, but, like Oakland, there is not much \\"there\\" there.	2005-08-05

He has an ear for dialog and an eye for funny anecdotes, or at least humorous, colorful slants on southern life as most outsiders have come to know the \\"Bible belt\\".    In \\"Juror\\", Grisham uses almost every stereotype and prototypical hero he can find, from the black family of PhDs to the boozy journalist, gun-totin' lawyers, simple-mided janitor, corrupt sheriff, eccentric old folks, gorgeous widow, family of moonshiners and monsters, and the mournful sister of the deceased. There are elements of many of Grisham's previous books, especially \\"A time to kill,\\" and some of the characters are pretty worn out from overuse.    Our narrator, Willie, the entrepreneurial college drop out who is able to manage, write and edit a disaster of a paper into a smart newspaper, stumbles into the proverbial gold mine, taking a $50,000 bankruptcy purchase into a $1.5 million sale nine years later. Along the way, Willie (hit with a southern version of his name at introduction, it really sticks) takes on powerful forces, beds the sister of the widow, learns how to dress like Tom Wolfe, refurnishes a rambling old house in a five-year project, and builds a newspaper that everyone wants to read, only to sell out in the end.    Underlying all of this is his relationship with the black matron, mother of all those PhDs and one runaway son, through the turbulence of the 1970s in southern America. Willie gets to be a redneck in training, a master of integration, and the tree-hugging war protestor, embraced and admired by the entire community. The last third of the book winds down with a transparent subterfuge by Grisham, who lets the surface suspect take all of the heat while an even casual reader can figure out who really is behind the murders of the jurors.    It all is a little too trite, too sweet, too stereotyped to make the experience worthwhile or memorable.

Perhaps most enjoyable are the folksy, down-to-earth detail of Medved's evolution, from his family's roots in Ukraine (his grandmother's fourteen-year separation from his grandfather alone is worthy of a Hollywood script), to early years in Philadelphia with a doting aunt, to his transformation to life in southern California, to high school in a sun-drenched Los Angeles suburb, to an extended stay at Yale (hitchhiking 80,000 miles before he graduated; there's a book right there), to political campaigns (from Bobby Kennedy to George McGovern to Ron Dellums), through the turbulent war protest years, and on through his conversion to conservative thought (having been mugged, or at least robbed, by reality in \\"Beserkly\\", this is an engaging, informative, enjoyable read.    The book is especially dear to men of Medved's generation, who came of age in the sixties, had tough experiences in the seventies, and came around in the eighties. His brief chapters have almost cute, provocative titles and an eye and memory for detail, be it a ride with a friend back from northern Calfornia that led to his best-selling story about his high school classmates, to specific memories of week end jaunts with his sleeping bag, to an almost Forrest Gump-like luck of being in the right place at the right time to meet, among others, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand, and Medved's second wife.    Embraced by conservative Christians, Medved earlier embraced his Orthodox Judaism, while swimming in a Hollywood culture of reformed, liberal, and left-wing personalities, trying to make a constructive cultural statement and stance out of the deteriorating drek flowing from Tinseltown. How he not only survived but how he consciously changed and thrived as abest-selling author, public speaker, and popular (two million people a week listen) talk show host, is a real American journey.    One minor error: In a funny story about trying to NOT receive a job offer at a Wisconsin regional university, Medved (p. 222) places Menomonie, Wisconsin 90 minutes west of Minneapolis, when the Stout campus and the city are east of the Twin Cities.	2005-07-23

First, Perkins is no economist. His 'hit man' work had nothing to do with economics; it had to do with his own personal greed and ambition. Second, he happily allowed himself to be seduced by Claudine, money, perks, and exotic locales. Third, he had no scruples. Bad enough that he knew little practical economics, he was more than happy to make up numbers to please his bosses and maintain his lifestyle. He knew what he was doing was wrong almost from the start. Fourth, even hit man who confess deserve to be punished. It is hard to simply say \\"I'm sorry\\" and ask to be considered a whistleblower. <br /> <br />The overall feel of the book is some sick parody of economic aid efforts or, worse, a tragic version of Austin Powers, Man of Mystery. If the results were not so sad, one could almost laugh.	2005-07-14

This may have been my own, never-fully-developed stab at the construct of \\"emotional intelligence.\\" At least my attempts at developing a theory may explain the success of this \\"quick\\" book. This is a short, useful treatment of an important construct, hampered primarily if not only by the difficulty in locating the password under the dust cover to allow the reader to go on line and assess his own emotional intelligence. I did not have the IQ to pull off that task but I guess I had the EI to not let it cause me to lose my temper.    The basic two x two delineation of the personal (self-awareness and self-management) and social (read the book to learn these two) elements of EI are clearly drawn and easy to understand. The authors distill a lot of scientific and even academic language.    If you have an interest in EI, or simply have heard of its possible role in explaining success, and you want a primer, this book will serve you.	2005-07-03

He seems to confuse thinking with reflexive action, following the maddeningly simple but lengthy chains of logic needed to play video games with the application of the intellect to reading and critical thinking. And the fact that \\"Hill Street Blues\\" plots were more complicated than \\"Dragnet\\" does not qualify either show as good or bad, nor does it make any case that the viewer of one is brighter or more engaged than the viewer of the other. The fact that game 'experience' teaches his nephew to conclude that a tax cut is needed to revive an industrial area in Sim City only shows me that the nephew has learned that certain rules or tricks work in video fantasy games, and he thinks that managiung a city is just another form of fantasy. It may be fun to learn rules by repeated mistakes in man interactive simulation, but he could have just as easily read this rule and learned it without repeated mistakes. <br /> <br />Woody Allen's \\"deep fat\\" joke from \\"Sleeper\\" was funny for what it was, satire from a man who has made his life out of ridiculing conventional thinking among Park Avenue liberals. To suggest that we have learned or may soon learn the \\"deep fat\\" is good for you, or that reading is \\"bad\\" for you, simply defies the imagination. <br /> <br />Reviewer Saperstein hit the nail on the head: This book is designed to make those who feel guilty to feel good about themselves. These people will give this book four- and five-star reviews. In fact, \\"Everything bad\\" reads like an overwritten thesis by a precocious college senior whose professor wants to be so hip that he goads the students along, mistaking erudite language substitute for clear, meaningful analysis. Where Johnson might be right is that reading books such has his can give good writing and engaging reading a bad name. My daughter could install software on her Mac when she was two years old and she still enjoys interactive games at age nine, but give her choice and a good book wins her attention every time.	2005-07-03

It is a story about how the New York Times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page. Oh how the mighty have fallen!    The time of power (terror?) for Tweed's edition of Tammany Hall was relatively short, but Tammany Hall power lingered well after Tweed's demise, another eithy-five years. The critical moment to the story is when Tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for New York City, putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves. The four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves, primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build. A disgruntled 'whistleblower' (the term had no meaning back then) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud. There are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the Times' hands, but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the \\"Ring\\" could be, how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe, cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings. People who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people's friend -- the government -- can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution.    The cast of characters, sinners, (few) saints, and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task. Thomas Nast, a pivotal character if not the hero of the book, provides some vivid, visual signposts. Nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers', he was one of thefirst to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today's politicians. Nast's giving Tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story. It certainly helped catch Tweed when he jumped bail. A few maps, perhaps some old drawings, and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast. There are some historic New York Times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context.    Any reasonably educated American should have learned at least the sketchy details of Tweed's nefarious deeds and Nast's colorful cartoons. Ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing, filling in the gaps, and bringing now faded, black-and-white characters back to life.	2005-07-03
US	52891206	R2J3DXS6RLDK3F	0895260190	388961491	South Park Conservatives: The Revolt Against Liberal Media Bias	Books	4	12	18	N	N	Mainstream media loses its mind(share)	\\"South Park Conservatives\\" (SPC) is short (162 pages), acerbic and politically incorrect (how could a chapter dedicated to the television show, South Park, not be?), and structured around the counter-liberal elements (talk radio, FOX, the blogosphere, conservative book publishers, and conservative college students). Anderson cites the Limbaugh-led media revolution, spurred by Reagan deregulation of `fairness' on the airwaves, and giving life back to the dying AM side of radio while igniting a fire under conservatives over the past fifteen to twenty years.    SPC is well-researched, well-argued, and heavily footnoted (fourteen pages of endnotes). The content and theme will be familiar to regular readers of conservative blogs and City Journal. Much of this ground has been tilled before by Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Mona Charen, and other Regnery authors. Anderson's publishing home, City Journal, published earlier forms of chapters (on illiberalism and college conservatives).    There is some interesting new ground. The success and the irreverence of the referenced television show allows Anderson to explore  and bring needed attention to conservative elements and personalities in Hollywood, including comedians Colin Quinn, Dennis Miller, Julia Gorin, and Nick Di Paolo.    Blogs are a powerful new, alternative media. Much like the Big Three automakers once discounted the efforts of Japanese automobile manufacturers, the mainstream media's continuing hubris blinds them to the responsive, pervasive, influential blogs. Traditional journalists are fooling themselves and the public when they claim that their work alone is objective, unbiased, professional, balanced, well-researched, and double- and triple-checked for factual accuracy. Even when it is, they can still get it wrong. So the audience looks elsewhere, to new media and to new voices.    Colleges present some strange, unfamiliar ground for the study of the `new' or younger conservative movement. Once liberal strongholds and breeding grounds, overt and over-the-top political correctness has generated a new stream of conservatives who are more skeptical of the left than they are embracing of the right. They are, based on Anderson's interviews, pro-life and also in favor of gay marriage. They are pretty interested in partying, hooking up, and having a good time, but not so much with drugs. Favoring Comedy Central's South Park, there are more likely to launch a profane tirade against entrenched liberals and to support American military power than they are to lead a protest. College students seem more libertarian and anti-PC than traditional conservative, and this new trend merits watching.    NOTE: Although he writes about historic events and figures, my colleague, Thomas DiLorenzo (p. 127) is a best recognized as an economist, not an historian.	2005-06-26

Is he being punished or protected? Does he have parents? Why should the president care about him? We are about to see a man placed in the cross hairs of a few corrupt men. So fasten your seat belt and get ready for a long flight. <br /> <br />Enter Teddy Maynard, the epitome of the power-hungry, psychopathic and physically crippled uberbureaucrat, head of the CIA, swathed in blankets. Even less likeable are the president, his chief advisor, and the president's son. What a very sorry lot. It is hard to believe that any such three officials could be in positions of elected or appointed power in America. They are petty, venal, unattractive, unsympathetic. And they are about to make Backman a whole lot sorrier - or so they think. They want to extract their own form of petty revenge on Backman for Joel's unproven sins, all under the guise of national security. <br /> <br />While Grisham readily admits to being outside his element in the spy and international intrigue genre, this book really reads much like \\"The Firm\\", with Bologna, Italy substituting for Memphis, and the CIA representing the legal mafia of Grishham's breakthrough book. As in \\"The Firm\\", what it will take is an imperfect, greedy, brilliant but nave lawyer to turn the tables on well-resource adversaries, taking the reader on a busman's holiday around northern Italy, whereas \\"The Firm\\" used the Caribbean. Backman is at first the victim of his own blindness and imbalanced life; only later does he show some signs of humanity and balance. <br /> <br />Despite some real credibility gaps and obvious oversights by the highly trained assassins, spies, and minders, Grisham still provides an enjoyable, fast-paced, if light read. The conclusion will leave many readers frustrated, annoyed and even angry. The loose ends tie together much too quickly and there are other loose ends lying about. So it's not great literature but, at a minimum,Grisham does a better job of capturing life, customs and style in northern Italy than do most of those touristy Tuscan guidebooks and novels. At least Backman makes a solid, concerted effort to learn Italian. And, of course, he is charmed by the beautiful, damaged, Italian, middle-aged Madonna. But let's not quibble. Just pick it up and read it at the beach, or on that next long-haul flight.	2005-06-20

A delicious if amoral tale of a man, alone in the City, a small but desirable part of the media, a slightly damaged (by marriage) package, who employs the simple act of removing his glasses and the details of the demise of his marriage to bed woman after woman after woman. This is a funny, lighthearted cross between \\"Bright lights, big city\\" and \\"American psycho.\\" So if you are easily offended by ubercasual flings, be forewarned. <br /> <br />Not so much toxic as enabled by colleagues keen to set him up on power blind dates, with women with more physical appeal than intelligence, and an incredibly cold, methodical follow through on his part: unreturned phone calls, more unreturned phone calls, and an \\"arrangement\\" to keep sleeping with an former SOG (sort of girlfriend), with both sides seeing this as the ultimate in sex without strings. <br /> <br />There is clearly a secret, sinful pleasure to be found in his life. While hard to admire his values, you have to admire his pluck. Like the heroine in \\"Sex in the City,\\" he uses literature (a masters degree) and his pseudo-celebrity status to write about baldness and strip joints for trendy magazines and to exchange literate quips with sometimes dull prospective partners as kind of a high end trivial pursuit of pop and classical culture. So, yes, he does have some standards. And, yes, he has no money for most of the story and pounds out articles at an unbelievable staccato pace, given his heavy `social' schedule. <br /> <br />The first few pages are a slow read. Once you pick up his pace - and it is breathtaking - one can only shake one's head in wonder at his conquests.	2005-06-16

Set aside the forty-six  plus year gap between visits to Italy along with the minimum of twenty-five year age difference in the couple and you can enjoy yourself without spending too much time pondering the algebra. The book is populated with Italian stereotypes of rabid cyclists, fast drivers, winding roads, automobile accidents, world-class home cooking, barbershop characters, perfect nights, beautiful sunsets, aromatic dishes, stunning women, intuitive mothers, and romantic if clumsy men. A very rapid, easy, even engaging read, \\"Home\\" may satisfy some of your longing for a return to one's roots or for an highly improbable story of romance with a beautiful woman in a man's golden years.	2005-06-13
US	52891206	R12Q9UGXF2OZ8H	0131467506	389837219	The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits	Books	4	152	160	N	N	Ruminating at the bottom of the pyramid (BOP)	\\"Fortune\\" is an interesting, inspiring book. The study of poverty eradication gets short shrift in most business schools but this book suggests that a lot of resources and a phalanx of graduate students (since most graduate students claim to be poor, perhaps they empathize better; at least they're cheaper to hire than business faculty) at Wharton and Michigan did a lot of digging for answers. This is a noble cause, well-financed, and maybe these two business schools will support these efforts with a revision to their MBA curricula. While teaching a man to fish is better than giving a man a fish, it is better still to teach a village how to raise fish (or capital, or critical mass, or some other key resource), and that is the fundamental if implicit message and philosophy here. Poor people don't need charity; they need access to and information about the tools of capitalism, and governments and other not-for-profits are not likely to do this as such actions would put them out of business. Read the \\"Twelve principles of innovation for BOP markets\\" (pp. 25 - 27) and you'll get the basic Reader's Digest, Harvard Business Review executive summary.    The mendacity of the claim, \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help you,\\" gets a lot of reinforcement here. Rather than help poor people, an early table (p. 11) shows that the government charges poor people more than rich people for the same water service. And the evidence, much of it discovered by Peru's Hernando De Soto, that governments delight in making entrepreneurship, innovation and capitalism almost a criminal offense, shines right through.    The false conceit exposed here is that governments are not likely to fix poverty, nor are NGOs, the UN, or other alphabetical, \\"not-for-profit\\" agencies. Maybe HLL, CEMEX, SMEs or some other, similarly acronymed, profit-seeking organizations will do it. It is not clear that there is a fortune at the bottom of the pyramid, even if there are four billion people (depends, really, on how you define poverty) willing to spend a penny a day on shampoo. There certainly is a profit to be made, but this time it is the poor who stand most to profit from free, global markets.    \\"Fortune\\" also has little, nagging problems. Like most empiricists, this book wants to use data as a singular noun. The font is small and flourished, making the text physically difficult to read. There is a cryptic table (exactly what is a `nos' anyway\\"?), a graph with no labels for the x- and y-axes. The book is awash with acronyms and academic jargon. Some of the bold-faced assertions read like doctoral dissertation hypotheses. Maybe because the book is primarily graduate-student written case studies with a lengthy introduction by the author, there is a tendency to repeat information from previous chapters. Decrying excessive packaging and high transaction costs, the authors also commend single-use purchases on a daily basis, filling land fills with sachets and making shopping a daily chore. If we are going to `microfinance' progress, we might want to start with a store credit for a refillable shampoo bottle (I am pretty sure that Coca-Cola mastered this marketing concept in South America years ago). In case the bookstore browser is unsure as to what the book is about, the book has a title (\\"The fortune at the bottom of the pyramid\\"), a subtitle (\\"Eradicating poverty through profits\\" and a sub-subtitle (\\"Enabling dignity and choice through markets\\"). And the dust cover blurbs from Bill Gates, Madeleine Albright, and similar `names' are a bit hyperbolic.    David Landes (\\"The wealth and poverty of nations\\") did a better job of explaining the cultural and legal system changes needed to make transactions easier for the customers. TGO (I'll let you look it up) means we have to have a government that assists wealth creation rather than simply tax, block, or prohibit progress out of poverty by people.	2005-06-13
US	52891206	R3EMIMS5TG9C5F	0451215109	448491599	Biggest Brother: The Life of Major Dick Winters, The Man Who Lead the Band of Brothers	Books	5	125	127	N	N	Winters of our content; a man for all seasons	This is a fascinating story about a man who may have become to the World War II generation what Joshua Chamberlain was to the Civil War: A quiet, competent, personable, spiritual and serious man who shows uncommon leadership under unforgiving circumstances. And what makes Dick Winters so special is how ordinary his life has been, before and after the war. <br /> <br />Most of the book covers the time period, story, and even the dialogue from Stephen Ambrose's and HBO's \\"Band of brothers\\". The first twelve chapters draw heavily from the written and video record produced by Ambrose and Tom Hanks, respectively. Ambrose did the important job of making this long, dangerous journey accessible to the American public. A storyteller, Ambrose had the intuition to find the elements of a story he needed to tell, and he made Dick Winters the focal character. Hanks, riding the success of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" saw the substance in Ambrose's book. Ambrose feared for a brief time that Hanks wanted to play Winters in the HBO miniseries; Ambrose thought Hanks would be a better Herbert Sobel, the \\"chickens**t\\" officer who drove the men of Easy Company through much of their training. Fortunately, Hanks played neither. While Ambrose wrote the story and Hanks made the miniseries, Winters made it all possible. And \\"Biggest brother\\" provides the focus and intimacy that neither of these preceding works could. <br /> <br />There are some additional elements worth noting. Winters' 117 letters to Annie DeEtta Almon provide some detailed, contemporaneous memories. Also, we learn that Sobel tried to commit suicide in 1971; his family thinks he was mistreated in the book and miniseries. Winters continued to show disdain for Sobel years later. The ubiquitous, alcoholic Lewis Nixon fades away after offering Winters a start in business after the war, based on their deep if inexplicable friendship during the war. Winters admires - however reluctantly -- Ronald Spiers and Bill Guarnere for their soldierly skills and leadership, while acknowledging that they killed prisoners. Winters himself admits to his deceit when he declines to send out a useless patrol, highlighted in an episode in the miniseries. <br /> <br />The book mentions but gives short shrift to Winters' leadership style. A three-page Appendix offers some insights, but it includes a section on how living with a family in England gave him time for reflection and self-analysis. There is much more about his leadership embedded in his book. <br /> <br />Winters entered the army, in part, to beat the draft in the run up to the war in August 1941. In less than four years he worked - really worked - his way from private to major. Read carefully and you'll see how. First, he had a college education and real work experience before he went into the army. He worked hard at learning the tradecraft of techniques and leadership. Reading a map, choosing a strategy, selecting cover, preparing his weapons, are reading the field manual helped make him an `expert'. He offers observations about foolhardy actions taken by men that led to their deaths, like a British tank commander who ignored Winters warning about a German tank lurking ahead. Realize that Easy Company spent twenty-three months training for eleven months of combat; they made five jumps to qualify as paratroopers and most made only two combat jumps, D-Day and Market Garden. Thorough preparation made Winters and his men combat-ready and earned Winters the respect of his men. And his personality made him a leader. Winters also knew it was critical to be seen with and to live and work with his men, without getting too close, too personal. They were his brothers in arms, close-knit colleagues, but he worked hard to not simply be one of the men. He maintained a minimal but critical separation from the men. And now, in his golden years, Winters has outlived almost all of his men, giving life to an American hero, one we can celebrate for years to come.	2005-06-12

In the summer of 1977 I was a graduate student at Penn State. This central but rural, college town location meant that you could get papers from all over Pennsylvania and all the New York city papers as well. Reading of the travails of the city that summer from a comfortable distance made me interested in reading a comprehensive coverage of that time. In general, \\"Burning\\" is a satisfying read, less emotional than one might expect from such a traumatic period, and surprisingly revealing of the author's apparent fondness - maybe I'm reading too much into this -- for the halcyon days of old-fashioned, liberal-leaning, Democratic machine politics. <br /> <br />\\"Burning\\" is somewhat of a liberal catharsis, where the hopes and dreams of New York city plunge in the throes of some of the best-intentioned yet inept and easily forgotten (except, perhaps, by New Yorkers) liberal politicians to grace the political landscape in the last fifty years: Abe Beame, John Lindsay, Bella Abzug, Mario Cuomo, Percy Sutton, Hugh Carey. The real pivotal politico was once the quintessential Greenwich Village liberal: the carnage and financial chaos of the years leading up to the climatic 1977 events produced the unlikely elevation of the transformational mayor, Ed Koch. By defeating Cuomo in the Democratic primary in 1977, Koch laid the groundwork not only for an even more conservative yet somewhat liberal mayor (Rudy Giuliani) but also the eventual triumph of Republicans in Albany, as Cuomo's administration turned over the reins to George Pataki. Koch began to introduce some sensibility to union relations, city finances, the private sector, and city pride. <br /> <br />And it often appears that the stronger story line, the one closer to the author's heart, is the Reggie Jackson-Billy Martin ongoing title fight for the 1977 season. In one of baseball's most dysfunctional relationships, Jackson triumphs in October, leaving Martin licking his wounds. Jackson, a man in the right place in the right time, one of the first real free agent fiascos perpetrated by George Steinbrenner, receives some adulation that some would feel is undeserved. His baseball skills were almost as flawed as his interpersonal and team skills; his strikeouts, errors, and ego will likely be his legacy, while New York sportswriters worked overtime to make him a super hero. Face it, Roberto Clemente was a much better baseball player in every respect, but his brooding was used against him and his untimely death and career in Pittsburgh kept him from earning the type of recognition that Jackson craved, coveted, and created in New York. And you end up feeling pretty sorry for an even more enigmatic person, Martin. <br /> <br />The title, \\"The Bronx is burning,\\" refers to a Howard Cosell quip late in the baseball season, when flames are visible to a national audience from Yankee stadium. The focus of the book might better be described as \\"Bushwick is burning,\\" an earlier, more widespread and influential fire than the one noted by an acerbic sports commentator. The blackout-induced looting, the fingers pointing at Con Ed, and the search for the Son of Sam, and the peak of disco all end up playing secondary themes to the mayoral and pennant races. There's much more here than baseball heroics and wheeler-dealer politicians. <br /> <br />One final note: Some of the chapter endnotes are maddeningly broad and under-documented. Lengthy passages earn a brief note.	2005-06-11
US	52891206	R1MXQUMU3ES5V5	0299201007	926953236	Lying Together: My Russian Affair	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Lying to each other	A tragic comedy in many parts, \\"Lying together\\" has a clear double meaning, as we read about two very dysfunctional people lying to themselves as they lie in bed together in seedy Russian apartments. <br /> <br />I have to say that enjoyed this book, yet also warn potential readers that the story has all the elements of a college-educated person's version of the Jerry Springer show. There are just so many bad decisions, alcoholic episodes, disorders, abused drugs, manic-depressive states, states of denial, blind spots, and excessive bravado. If this had been a novel, it may have been dismissed as too incredible to be true. Having spent some time in Russia in the 1990's, my sense is that book brings all too true. Sad, very sad, but true. <br /> <br />By e-mail, Cohen falls inexplicably even irrationally for a less-than-almost crush, Kevin,  and agrees to fly off to Russia, on a whim and promise of a political scandal. Perhaps she suffered to take on this relationship for the same reason she suffered from bulimia. She ought to know: her parents are a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist. She wants to deny that children of such parents can produce dysfunctional kids. The fact that the family talks about everything - her evidence of their normality - does not provide much cover for what is better described as some major gaps in translating values across generations. <br /> <br />Once back in Moscow (she had studied there years earlier), she jumps right into a death defying if not death wish desire to document the sex and slave trade emanating from a scandalous, corrupt Russian society. The crush provides the contacts, the translation precision, and the stimulus to push the journalistic envelope. Only too soon does Cohen learn that her business is less about breaking stories and more about confirming clichs. And her stomping grounds, St. Petersburg and Moscow, offer plentiful fodder for clichs. She is most compelling when she documents the difficulty of life in these twocities today, from the violence, to the bribes, to the petty and not-so-petty corruption, the terrible architecture, the strip joints and gun-toting security guards, the tiny, rusty, domestic, automobiles alongside gleaming SUVs, the ongoing fatal fascination with cigarettes and vodka. The problem seems to be that she and Kevin fit too well into this marginal life, where living on the edge is the only place to live. <br /> <br />Yes, the book is enjoyable, sometimes pretentious, and compelling (I read it in less than 24 hours, eager to see how Cohen pulls out of this mess). But it is a dark, stormy ride, giving me the most satisfaction to be able to say that I am glad that I was not foolish enough to engage in such a crazy pursuit. That's why Jerry Springer can be satisfying: I'm just glad that it wasn't me. At least Jen and Kevin earn some sympathy. Good luck in their next endeavors.	2005-06-11
US	52891206	RSR7QB6A4HPE6	159240118X	699911837	The Reluctant Tuscan	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Another American finds Tuscany to his liking: Go figure	Admit it, many of us long for an idyllic life in northern Italy, Tuscany to be more precise. We read about it all the time. \\"Seinfeld\\" made jokes about it. English poets and politicians have always found the region intoxicating. \\"A room with a view\\" offers nineteenth century melodrama about an earlier batch of foreigners finding Tuscany to offer too much sun. Some of us have family roots there. So we keep coming. The dream of a sunny, dry climate (`il sfumato'), olives and grapes, delicious meals, and family-filled piazzas has a strong appeal for most of us. \\"A reluctant Tuscan\\" will help you satisfy your craving, yet also make you skeptical of finding your own little corner of Tuscany.    Intrigued and enchanted, we read and watch films about Tuscany for the same reason many people watch Martha Stewart shows: We can imagine the life but know that we are almost certain to never live it. The charm is in its dream-like quality, the fantasy of it all, including the idea of making it big enough to afford the lifestyle or simply turning ones back on the American rat race for this languorous life. What's not to like?    This is well-covered territory. Forget Frances Mayes, whose overly popular \\"Under a Tuscan sun\\" produced a string of subsequent titles (In Tuscany, Bella Tuscany, Bringing Tuscany home) and a movie starring Dianne Lane wholly unlike the reasonably charming, original book. For a closer look at Italians and especially their love affair with football (`soccer' to the unacquainted), read Englishman Tim Parks (A season in Verona, Italian neighbors, Italian education) or \\"Fatal vision\\" author Joe McGinniss' (The miracle of Castel di Sangro). Peter Mayle started it all, writing about Provence.    In each case, we have a foreigner (\\"stranieri\\"), a fish out of water, struggling to learn the idiosyncrasies of Italian life, marveling at the enduring culture, and capturing almost each Italian in stereotypical style, while finding a way to work with the contractors andbureaucrats. Money pours out. No longer is it American tourists. Rather it appears that it is American house hunters who keep the Italian economy alive. And not just Americans looking for a house; these Americans want to revive thousand-year-old rubble into villas, estates, and images the Americans brought with them from books such as these. For Doran, there are old curses and gossip, not just rustic hilltops and whimsical villages. And there is some melodrama as well: a career crisis, an auto accident, a feud with a neighbor, a romantic twist, and a final realization that there is not much back in Los Angeles if Tuscany is where you really wanted to retire in the first place.    These books might be more interesting if they weren't written by, well, writers. Doran is a Hollywood television writer (all these books about `real life' in Italy seem to be produced by people who are, by profession, writers or professors, and not typical Americans). There is a hint of a movie treatment, perhaps a television pilot (imagine Larry David in \\"Curb your Italian enthusiasm\\"), and the happy ending with the seed of this book planted back in California. It is an enjoyable read but a bit too stereotypical, melodramatic, and familiar for my taste. For a view from the other side, try \\"Too much Tuscan sun\\" by local guide Dario Castagno. Here the Americans, primarily rich, uninformed tourists are the source of humor, not the locals.	2005-06-05

Sometimes the bad advice from the left is so bountiful that she appears to engage in overkill. Let's just say that there is plenty of evidence. <br /> <br />Six chapters cover crime (the impact of Giuliani's zero tolerance policies on the murder rate in NYC saved thousands of lives; psychiatric hospitals have reduced their patent count by hundreds of thousands since the 1950s and guess where they end up), racism (heavy-handed, dishonest Democratic party pandering to African-Americans means that Dems get 85% of the African-American vote but not since LBJ the majority of the national vote, and LBJ's civil rights legislation passed because of Republicans and despite Democratic opposition), welfare (Charen quotes single one mother of six children from six different fathers who tells NYC mayor John Lindsay that it is her job to bear children and his job \\"to take care of them.\\"), families (traditional two-parent families are the best form of poverty prevention ever invented), homelessness (Charles Osgood projects 19 million homeless by the year 2000, using the conventional wisdom of Mitch Snyder's admitted made-up figure of 3 million homeless in the eighties; see psychiatric population, above), and education (public schools spend little of their budgets on students, books or even teachers who teach, and when they do teach the subjects increasingly have little to do with a useful education). <br /> <br />Depressing and disturbing but detailed and devastating. <br /> <br />Note: On p. 194 she identifies Blanche Lincoln as (D-AK). I think AK means Alaska, and Lincoln isfrom Arkansas (AR).	2005-06-04

Hastings writes about Europe from summer 1944 to May 1945, portraying the insane cruelty and the dogged determination of three large armies, the western Allies, the Nazis and the Russians.    To sort out a complex story, he breaks down the narrative into sections covering Montgomery, Arnhem, a \\"storm of steel,\\" Soviet warlords, Warsaw, the Scheldt, the Hurtgen forest, East Prussia, the Russian offensive, the Allied air forces, the Rhine, the tortured, imprisoned and starved prisoners of Nazi occupation, and the final assault on Berlin.    The personal stories and experiences carry the work. Here is one edited example (p. 52):    \\"Privates Mann and Hoyle, successfully knocked out an 88mm gun. Mann was hit twice, but fought on through the day until he was hit twice more, in both arms. ...An American NCO, Sergeant Betras, threw one `potato masher' back at the enemy before it exploded. ... Joe Mann was in a trench with six other men, his shattered arms taped to his body. He suddenly shouted, `Grenade!' as yet another fell in among them, then threw himself on top of it. After the explosion he murmured, `My back's gone,' then died. He was later awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor.\\"    This is not an easy or a quick read. There is so much to digest and much of it to disgust the reader. And, of course, this is a well-worn topic. Hastings makes it readable, personal, and memorable without glossing over the horrors or dwelling on them needlessly. Most important, he offers revised if not revisionist theories on battles and generals, e.g., the ill-advised strategy to avoid an early drive on Antwerp and the Scheldt, the failure to liberate Holland by late 1944, Zhukov versus Konev, Eisenhower versus Montgomery, Patton versus Bradly.    There are about a dozen maps. Some more would have been helpful, especially with the many villages, towns and cities referenced in the text; many of theseare not on the maps. And what appears to be one small error occurs on p. 282, where Hastings reports, \\"The temperature was 25 degrees centigrade. Women were abandoning babies in the snow.\\"    Reading this fine work brought back memories of my first term paper as a high school sophomore where, inspired by my father's stories of his days as a bomber navigator in 1944-45, I first made a reasonably serious study of the European air theater. This work planted a seed and my interest only grew over the years. Hastings adds a deep, thoughtful, painfully vivid edition to my garden.	2005-05-21

You can draw your own conclusions as to the motives behind that decision.]. Something is missing here. \\"Level\\" is not \\"flat\\". And ships don't fall off a flat surface. Is he trying to be ironic? If so, Friedman ought to leave that to P.J. O'Rourke. If he thinks a \\"brief history\\" of the past five years is a funny concept, again I refer you to O'Rourke for more robust and pointed humor.    As a journalist, with seemingly unlimited resources and the once-gilded New York Times brand name behind him, Friedman has leveraged his basic skills into best-sellerdom, all the while seemingly in shock and awe of all the things his rich travel budget allows him to take in. Yet I have to ask, where's the beef?    Yes, the world has shifted from networks based on mythology and monarchies, through manufacturing and Marxism, to today's global marketing, but services aren't a new phenomenon; they've always been with us. And although wireless communication has made the world faster and more competitive, life is no more ruthless, violent or uncertain now than when plagues, expansive military conquest, disease, poor hygiene, inbred monarchies, and wealth-by-acquisition ruled the world as they have for most of human existence. Sure, technology has increased the pace, but each generation seems to think that the last generation had it slow and easy, and that has never been the case. The poor villager who wandered too far away from his hut 1,500 years ago experienced no less a shock than today's global traveler stepping off a plane in Mumbai.    And this outsourcing 'problem' is not new and it is not based simply on information technology. For as long as man has tried to better his lifeand to leverage his advantages, he has hired someone else to produce the things he needs, be it food, cooking, child care, or production. Like services, outsourcing is not new. That villager from 1,500 years ago thought that outsourcing crop production to the next village over was no less daunting or distant than Americans importing oranges from Israel or roses from Brazil. And you can bet the other villagers were mad as hell at him for taking away 'their' work.    For more than fifty years, columnists, pundits, journalists, armchair analysts, and bad economists have been intrigued by each new emerging economic superpower, from the Soviet Union, to the European Union, to Japan, to China, and now India, and each time all that wonderment and starry-eyed predictions have come to nothing. Like Ayn Rand said, what separates America from the rest of the world is that we were the first to think of making money, not just taking money. And America still does that very well. I still have my doubts about the sustainability of growth in China and India. Sooner or later they are going to hit a consumer-oriented economy and demands for many things their people don't demand today. Besides, their growth has been exaggerated by the fact that they started basically at zero. Bad analysts like straight-line extrapolations. Not only do these growth lines sometimes flatten out, they can nose dive. And what's bigger and more dramatic, 3% growth in a $11 trillion economy or 7% in a $200 million economy?    Maybe the world has become more homogenous with technology and communications. But anyone who thinks that there is some huge melting pot, in America or around the world, would be better served by recognizing the world as a salad bowl, not a melting pot. And neither the pot or bowl are flat.	2005-04-22

The Russian authorities delay the news and, when they say anything at all, first want to blame an unspecified American sub for causing the demise of the Kursk. Cooler minds and a more open Russian press prevail, and the truth leaks out. A thorough, impressive work, \\"Cry\\" represents an excellent piece of investigative journalism, pushing aside the misguided \\"collision\\" theories and illustrating the demise of the Russian military. <br /> <br />Although long-time enemies of the Russians, American, Norwegian or British rescue craft and experts volunteered to try and could have perhaps saved lives after a low-quality, high-risk torpedo exploded inside the Kursk's hull during a training mission. But it was not to be. Old habits die slowly and the stubborn, proud, resentful Russians would rather be dead than helped. The result was even greater embarrassment, in addition to the sad deaths of the crew that survived the initial blast. <br /> <br />No one in the Russian naval, or political hierarchy comes off well in this story. The harsh truth is that Russia tried to maintain a world-class military appearence using dated and rusty methods, including unserviced supply cranes for loading torpedoes and a torpedo that -- although an $11,000 \\"bargain\\" when compared with America's million-dollar torpedoes -- was more likely to destroy its launch ship. And that is just what happened. <br /> <br />The real pity must go out to the patriotic, well-intentioned yet poorly trained and equipped sailors of a decaying naval power. And not only the determined sailors, their parents, wives, brothers and sisters, and children all deserve our prayers and our sympathy. <br /> <br />Ramsey Flynn jumped on the story early and had to deal with tremendous obstacles of technology, geography, politics, culture and language to piece together a true multi-cultural experience and a story that speaks for the tenuous nature of Russian-American relations today. He did a fine job. Maps, details, notes, photos and extensive notes document all the sordid details. <br /> <br />Let's hope we learned something from out mistakes, for the sake of our children and the memories of these heroic victims of a corrupt, disingenuous system.	2005-04-04
US	52891206	R1MSHQ7KIWSG8V	0446576638	294324369	Night Fall	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Another consistent delivery	With baseball season about to open, let's just say that Nelson DeMille is the Roger Clemens of contemporary novels. He writes consistently good, engaging stories, with distinctive if stereotypical (good-looking second wife, tough cop, humorous divorced man) characters. Each page of his typical novel is laced with funny, often sarcastic and profane exchanges and thoughts from the protagonist. John  Corey is the perfect hero, perhaps Demille's alter ego. Corey is smart, thorough, in pursuit of justice, always working with beautiful women, and funny. <br /> <br />The TWA crash offers DeMille and excellent canvas, and it is no great revealation that he ties in to September 11, 2001, with a five-year later memorial service followed by a convenient absence of the two leading characters for forty-day assignments out of the country, allowing the book to climax on that fateful morning, killing off some characters and wiping out some evidence. <br /> <br />What this book may be best at doing is setting up the next novel, with its unresolved points, its back-from-the-dead CIA agent, and the continuing saga left over from the work that preceded this one. DeMille should have a good time tying together both of these previous works in a third novel. <br /> <br />This is a quick page turner. There is suspense, if too many convenient connections, from the all-powerful ally in the police department, to the heart of gold of the pivotal female character in the book. As my expectation in DeMille's books, I found myself smiling at Corey's jokes, sarcasm, and snide comments, and cringing at his perhaps excessive use of the f-word to color or describe just about everything goo or bad in his life. <br /> <br />Not an acquired taste and not too much of a fantasy for middle-aged men (vis-a-vis the fantasy of Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt character). Good, even very good, but not great.	2005-04-02

A jock fully exploits and enjoys the fruits of his exalted position and then unexpectedly learns that there is more to college than fan adoration. A preppy frat boy deflowers the \\"trying to fit in\\" freshman and loses the $95,000 job. The prep school roommate stays out all night and sleeps all day. The struggling reporter for the school paper finally publishes his breakthrough story and loses the girl of his dreams. <br /> <br />All stereotypes. All credible. And all generally uninteresting if fully drawn characters. Wolfe can't be blamed for disingenuousness in trying to live in the mind of an 18-year-old girl from North Carolina. Most authors don't live the life of their protagonists. That doesn't mean that the writers can't credibly research or imagine or write effectively about the characters. However, the characters in \\"Simmons\\" - stereotypes or not -- fail to earn the sympathy of the reader. Charlotte is beyond nave and her conversion to the social-climbing groupie is unconvincing. The \\"conversion\\" of the preening jock seems unlikely and comes about more from a challenge to his testosterone then from any intellectual desires. The final match of boy and girl at the end of the book is more of a fairy tale than a reasonable probability. <br /> <br />If there are lessons to be learned here they are these: First, parents need to prepare their daughters for the campus temptations, peer pressure and debauchery that can throw even the best intentions for college off track. And don't let your sons off either; they are the villains in this scenario if they are given free rein without clear lessons in character formation before they set off for university. Second, big-time college athletics, where wholly unqualified students play a form of professional sports for all the wrong reasons, are a national disgrace and an embarrassment and have no meaningful fit into the mission of a university. At best, they are expensive (and unprofitable) distractions. At worst, they undermine the very reason universities exist. <br /> <br />Are colleges more sex-crazed than they were thirty years ago? I doubt it. Are athletes more pampered than thirty years ago? I would bet several billion dollars in television and sports equipment money flowing into athletic departments would justify this conclusion.	2005-03-10

Traditional in many respects as a well-deserved recognition of those who fought in World War II, the extra element of the All-American football hero perspective makes \\"The All-Americans\\" special. This book almost came too late. It was nice to have it published before several of these true heroes passed on to the final reward that too many of their team mates experienced sixty years too soon. <br /> <br />Anderson, a Sports Illustrated staff writer, takes us from the beaches of Normandy in June 1944 back five years, to the arrival of Robin Olds, Henry Romanek, Hal Kauffman and Bill Busik at West Point and Annapolis. Anderson catalogs their years as plebes and burgeoning football stars, back in a time when Army and navy were true football powerhouses, tickets to the Army-Navy game cost $4.40 (a lot of money in those days, but nothing like the million dollar box seats sold for the 1945 game), radio was the primary live medium for transmission, and television was a nascent, close-circuit affair (some paid $2 for the broadcast to theaters in Philadelphia). The November 1941 Army-Navy game, eight days before the Pearl harbor attack, is the focal event, the last gasp of innocence before the all-too-expected war commenced. <br /> <br />Anderson has elicited long-buried yet vivid memories of practices, plays and heroics, first at play and then at war. German pillboxes, Japanese fighter planes and bloodthirsty sharks made life miserable for these former football stars; they used their discipline, smarts and perseverance to carry them through some very rough times. Romanek survived a bullet wound on June 6, 1944 and Kauffman had perhaps the most harrowing experience: surviving sharks and three days of drifting after having his ship suck in the South Pacific. Busik and Olds, by comparison, got off pretty easy. F the twenty-two starters of the 1941 Army-Navy game, four died in the war and more than a dozen reserves died in the service in those four years following that apocalyptic game. <br /> <br />Read it to recognize and honor a few more entries in the cast of the greatest generation.	2005-03-07

The intervening poverty provides most of the pages of the book and, while sympathetic, the players come across mostly as ciphers, with precious little to absorb or to engage the reader. Not that there needed to be something dramatic - and Haig provides plenty of period detail - but the drama of the tragedy and the poverty does not seem to do much other than to drain the life from all of the characters. Those who died suddenly, in mine explosions and collapses, at least often died quickly. <br /> <br />A mother, the wife of a mixed-faith marriage, loses her husband at an early age. She struggles with her children, an even more mixed and troubled crew. They struggle with the second world war and, even more so, with the poverty and further decline of western Pennsylvania coal mining. There is plenty of ground for more tragedy, even personal color. But the family is a group of misunderstood and puzzling, humorless misfits. The oldest son fights in the war, marries richly, hurriedly and unwisely, and becomes the stupid uncle lurking in the distance. The younger son flits through school, friends, addresses, and mystery without ever really letting the reader know why. The daughters are not strong or weak, just boring. <br /> <br />Tawnie O'Dell does a much better job with this poor coal mining genre.	2005-03-07

This book is boring, but not unpleasant. That is the lesson learned from reading this book. Archer spends so much of his time objecting to and fighting his conviction to really analyze prison life other than to make a few facile observations on the unintended consequences of some laws and prison practices. <br /> <br />Archer has a few admiring reviews. From the Independent on Sunday: \\"The finest thing that he's ever written.\\" From The Washington Post: \\"A tale that is not only important but true.\\" These read more like sarcasm than praise.

Only I knew what was coming. It did not take long to realize that Lanzerath was a key position in the battle, especially in thwarting the early, surprise advantage of the German forces. Plug this hole and you change the entire battle scenario. Kershaw writes a good, often first-hand story of the Battle of the Bulge. <br /> <br />Lt. Lyle Bouck and his intelligence and reconnaissance unit -- fewer than thirty men -- occupied that hole or key gap in the American line that fateful December 16, 1944 morning. While they did not stop the Germans, the I & R unit slowed the assault and informed headquarters, delaying the Germans and perhaps making the difference in the battle and the war. <br /> <br />Kershaw, along with his very good \\"Bedford Boys\\" may make a good successor to David Ambrose. This is a good read, with backgrounds on individual stories, useful \\"big picture\\" context for the unacquainted reader, and useful but not numbered maps. Kershaw writes, \\"See map 2\\" on p. 62 and you have to guess that the second map in the book -- an unnumbered page 76 -- is 'map 2'. Kershaw does make other irritating mistakes pointed out by others: \\"Irwin\\" instead of \\"Erwin,'\\" General \\"Black\\" and not General \\"Balck,\\" \\"army\\" when he meant \\"army group\\". It is hard to tell if this is poor editing, poor research or simply an inattention to detail. The dust cover includes praise from Douglas Brinkley, author of the Kerry 'biography', \\"Tour of Duty,\\" which has also been questioned for its accuracy or at least for not telling the complete story, so you can draw your own conclusions on both Kershaw's and Brinkley's editors. Even Ambrose's scholarship has generated criticism, including plagiarism charges. Maybe there is something lost when the story is told so much later by men who have little or no direct experience with the war, with the army, or the period. <br /> <br />Don't let that stop you from reading and enjoying this book. The first-person accounts make the story real and memorable. And makes me wish I could find that old simulation...	2005-01-09

You can hand it to them and say: \\"This is the book that ruined John Kerry.\\" <br /> <br />Kerry should have realized that when he ran on his record, someone might actually take him up on his claims. It was akin to Gary Hart saying, \\"Follow me. I have nothing to hide,\\" two days before the press found Donna Rice leaving his apartment at dawn. <br /> <br />This book may not even have been written had not the Democratic media machine turned on poor Howard Dean after his silly but hardly lethal scream in Iowa. But, no, the Dems looked to John Kerry, forgot to do their due diligence, and this is what they got in return. A windy, rambling Massachusetts liberal scuttled by a cogent rebuttal of inflated claims of heroism and integrity that the people of Massachusetts seemed eager to swallow for twenty-five years. Problem is, Massachusetts liberals navigate national campaigns as well as Ted Kennedy does at driving across wooden bridges after a few drinks. <br /> <br />As damning as the book was on Kerry's electoral prospects, Kerry and his advisors assembled a circular firing squad of responses, declining to sign his Form 180, revising his personal memories of who was president in 1968, pretending that he was not in Kansas City in 1971, and forgetting what \\"free fire zone\\" really means. On this last point, Kerry would like you to believe that it means that you are free to fire indiscriminately on anything when what it really means is that you need not call headquarters before you fire on a threat. Kerry made it sound like irresponsible war crimes when it actually led to more discretion and probably saved lives too. <br /> <br />Even more comical now is the \\"apology\\" from his staff that they failed to take the book seriously enough. Oh really? They responded to direct, specific, first-hand reports with attacks on the authors' motives, affiliations, and lifestyles. Some mainstream media would like you to think that Kerry lost because 56 million self-righteous, moralistic types turned up their noses at his vision for America when, in fact, this book shows that it was Kerry who turned up his patrician nose on the people who make this country work and he thought that he could run a \\"nuanced\\" but value-free campaign around America and around the truth.

Although the first ten pages can produce some confusion, when O'Dell shifts to the 'real' start of the story, the introduction makes sense and draws in the reader. This is one of the best novels I've read in two or three years. O'Dell's first work reminded me of Nelson DeMille's best work, although on a much more local, low-end scale. <br /> <br />Admittedly, the first ten pages almost led me to close the book, unfinished. Instead, I finished the entire book in one long night's read. It is true: This book is hard to put down. And, to the other 'crictics', yes, there are many elements of this story that would be the grist for about two weeks of Jerry Springer shows, e.g., \\"Horny housewife seduces murderer's son.\\" And, having spent a bit of time in western Pennsylvania myself as a youth (my grandparents lived in western Pennsylvania; one grandfather was a coal miner), the title still left me scratching my head a bit, even at the end. There weren't that many back roads involved and the tenor of the setting seemed a bit generic, white trash, even red neck, and not peculiar to coal mining country in Pennsylvania. <br /> <br />Those aren't knocks on \\"Back Roads\\". O'Dell has a great ear for dialog and, as a female author inabiting the male protagonist's mind and body, she does an excellent job. Her attnetion to the small details of life in this depressed, stressed, and repressed world brings life to a very dark story of incest, murder, betrayal, and poverty. Harley gives 'single parenthood' a whole new meaning as he struggles as the brother cum father of three girls, each with profound psychological wounds. And, as a teen, he acquits himself well, even as he fumes, fumbles, and makes his own mistakes. It made me wonder: \\"Could I have done any better?\\" <br /> <br />A final note: Don't let a young son or daughter read this. The subject, not the language or sex, is not pleasant. For a more mature reader, there are lessons and there is light in this dark tale.	2004-12-29

It is a terrific, consuming, colorful, rich read. I picked it up and read it in less than 24 hours, just two days after finishing O'Dell's first novel, \\"Back Roads\\" in the same, short span. Well done! <br /> <br />Compared to her wonderful first effort, \\"Coal Run\\" surfaces even more details about the struggle for life in the economic ruins of former coal country. There is more humor, love, and hope than in her much darker, first novel. My initial impression of her leading male character, based on \\"Back Roads\\" and now in \\"Coal Run\\" is that she can really slip into the skin of a young male protagonist. Again, that DeMille-like sense of disturbed humor, focusing on alcohol, sex and their myriad interactions, spills across the pages. You laugh along with the crippled former All-American as he works through the week where his nemisis is realeased from prison and cry at the memories of coal mine explosions,  fire and death. <br /> <br />My personal preference -- perhaps an easier, happier, simpler way out, but I'm a reader, not an author -- would have been for some more closure. I had another person in mind to receive the prized two hundrd acres from Flo's will. And I had another person in mind to be carried out of the house under the sheet in the last chapter. And while Ivan does find a form of closure with one deep, personal part of his life, I finished the book wondering about what would become of the young doctor, the surprisingly heroic lawyer, and the resurrected football star. Maybe there is a sequel in this. I sure hope so, and not in five years. I hope the author's personal problems are behind her. Check tawniodell.com.	2004-12-29

Actually, DiLorenzo, a superb colleague of mine, is more of a libertarian and true free-market thinker than a Tory conservative of the George Will mode. Understand this, and you will have a better appreciation for DiLorenzo's approach to capitalism and its cleansing powers.    People and markets proposer because we act in our own self-interest. Adam Smith was right and some label him 'liberal'. 'Liberal' means something quite different outside the United States. Those who equate Oliver Stone's \\"greed is good\\" mantra for capitalism are missing the point. \\"Greed\\" is \\"reprehensible acquisitiveness\\" and the beauty of capitalism is that the market speaks louder than government dictates or \\"greedy capitalists\\". When the government says, \\"I'm here to help you,\\" it's time to hold onto your wallets. With capitalism, it's your choice. Greed doesn't work; markets do.    DiLorenzo writes with a clear, accessible style. While he is an accomplished researcher and academic, he discovers and disseminates knowledge for a much larger public than other academics. And he is brave enough to take on well-entrenched conventional wisdom, be it the nanny state or worshipful devotees of Abraham Lincoln.    We have a problem with unchallenged soft-headed, bleeding heart, liberal thought on many college campuses. DiLorenzo is part of the solution to the excessive political correctness rampant on many college campuses. Read this and open your eyes and mind. This is a nice companion piece to David Landes' \\"The wealth and poverty of nations: Why some nations are so rich and others so poor.\\" And it fits with the recent studies of the differences between English and French law, and the impact of their respective legal systems on economic success.	2004-12-27

Rush Limbaugh's audience of twenty million is almost as big as the CBS, NBC, and ABC evening news audience -- combined. Tom Brokaw `ascended' to number one among the big three during his time by letting the size of his audience decline at a slower ate than did Peter Jennings and Dan Rather. The good news is that Rather is leaving; the bad news is that Katie Couric may be taking his place. <br /> <br />Having defined the left side of American political thought and values as the center, it is easy to see how every smug MSM anchor, pundit, and columnist (few of them have the skills, balance or professionalism to be a real journalist; they are talking heads, entertainers, and armchair `experts') thinks that he or she represents the bright, center of the spectrum. Bozell dissects these `enlightened' positions on abortion, gay rights, taxes, the environment, and guns, allowing the MSM's own words to destroy what little credibility they ever could have claimed to possess. Then Bozell takes on Bill and Hillary, Janet Reno's seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the `disputed' 2000 election (it was those same dim network bulbs who said the Florida polls were closed and that Gore had won, when they weren't and he wasn't), and the war on terror. Maureen Dowd repeatedly shows her own special form of ignorance and hypocrisy, but she has a lot of company. <br /> <br />The counterargument from the left, from Eric Alter, Al Franken, Michael Moore and their ilk, is quickly dispatched with cogent rebuttals. Even the advent of Air America, failure that it is, can be seen as a conservative triumph, as the liberal moguls pour money into a no-win situation. It's the audience, stupid! <br /> <br />The basic problem is that the MSM critique, promote and reward themselves, with a tin ear for facts and for their audience. Brokaw claims that no one would listen to him if her were perceived as being biased. Well, he is and they aren't. His shrinking audience is fewer than 9 million in a country of almost 300 million. The audience is voting with their ears, their eyes and their pocketbooks, and then showing up at the polls and not on the  MSM's Nielson ratings. And the result is a self-congratulatory, barely ambulatory MSM, withering away. Good riddance.	2004-12-24

Books	4	13	14	N	N	Dense, detailed, disturbing new perspective on an old war	Forget  or at least set aside much of what you think you know about the onset of the First World War. David Fromkin has some `new' ideas. And three hundred dense if not overwhelming pages of analysis of old and new records, makes for a pretty compelling case. He uses new studies and records, some previously unavailable or hidden, to make his case. <br /> <br />Prior to the start of the war, the seemingly quiet period among the great powers of Europe was mostly a charade, a shadow dance, while behind the scenes most of those great powers were trying to determine when - not if - the next war would commence. Better, each thought, that they commence it, less they be caught unawares. <br /> <br />Those twenty-five years before the war were also a period of almost regular assassinations. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Serbia, while often singled out as the event that precipitated the war, was not a singular event and, as Fromkin shows, did not really bring about the war. At least not the \\"great\\" war. <br /> <br />As Fromkin notes, \\"It takes at least two to keep the peace, but it only takes one to start a war. (282-3) Germany especially, fearing the development of Russia and the Slavs, with industrialization financed by France, saw war with Russia to be inevitable. This was a racial struggle, the Teutonic race against the Slavic. Germany even imagined England as an ally in this crusade; some of this assumption was reasonable, based on blood ties. Germany had plans for war before Sarajevo. But after Sarajevo, Germany also thought that Austria-Hungary could quickly declare war on Serbia, wipe out resistance, and immobilize the Russian forces before they moved against Germany or Austria-Hungary. And all the while, Austria-Hungary saw Germany as their insurance against a Russian attack. Both sides counted on the other to thwart Russian intentions. It is almost ironic that Germany invaded France, through Belgium, to stop Russia. And that Britain, facing civil war at home in Ireland and looking for peace on the continent, turned almost overnight when Germany violated Belgian neutrality. Fromkin notes that Britain would not have been so upset had France done this to Belgium; Britain's concerns were with balance, including keeping French power, not Belgian sovereignty or neutrality. <br /> <br />And it was not a German appetite for colonies that drove the war. Fromkin notes, \\"[I]t was not imperialism that caused the war; it was the war that produced a new wave of imperialism.\\" (278) This was a period when wealth meant taking it by conquest. But much of that grwoth in colonial imperialism had run its course. Nearby, European lands offered more tempting targets and insurance against invasion. 'Invade or be invaded' seemed to be a prevailing credo of the time, and no colonies were likely to be doing the invading. <br /> <br />Besides, there were two wars. Fromkin writes: \\"Two wars, not one; that is the key.\\" (274) Adding, \\"Germany instigated the war against Russia on its own account.\\" Serbia was almost an afterthought, a diversion. Expected to be quickly crushed by Austria-Hungary, it offered Germany an excuse for a initiatives against enemies, real or imagined, current or future. <br /> <br />War, in the time before the \\"great\\" war, came to be accepted as the natural course of human and national events. Some of these problems of war remain with us today: Pre-emptive attack, misguided assumptions, bad intelligence on the enemy, subterfuge, distrust, racism, greed, paranoia. It may be both comforting and disconcerting to realize that our problems are not recent. Perhaps they are timeless, inevitable. Let's hope not.	2004-12-02

Sixty years earlier, he had flown with the American forces based in England and the parallels to the the men of Stalag XVII moved me considerably. My emotions surged. <br /> <br />Take \\"The great escape\\", \\"Stalag 17\\", and mix in \\"Band of Brothers\\" and you will have a good sense of the story. In April 1944, a young, optimistic flier loses his plane and two comrades in one of the \\"last, big\\" Nazi efforts to thwart American daylight bombing. The crippled plane struggles to make it back to safe territory, but fails. Local people and soldiers round up the dispersed crew for a harrowing journey by rail to a camp for American fliers -- Stalag XVII -- in Austria. Kindness and cruelty quickly become evident and random. <br /> <br />The camp has a history, and the older 'kriegies' resent the newly arrived, only recently shot down fliers. Some of the 'old' men have been there a year or more already. In a stroke of luck, Handy finds a link that leads him to the leadership of  a tunnel detail. While the escape attempt loses steam, the tunnel plays a critical role in saving the life of a famed escape artist and sabateur who owes his life to Handy. This leads to a second escape attempt, only with audacity abd a twist. Read the book to see who gets out, who dies, and who hangs on to April 1945 when the Nazis march the remaining prisoners west, towards Patton and the Americans. <br /> <br />The beauty of the book can be found in Handy's stories of the men, their lives, their dreams, and their consistent efforts to stay alive and to stay focused on home, if not escape. From the Native American sage, watching over all the comings and goings from his quiet perch, to Young, who while despised by the men, makes Handy a keepsake that lasts the duration, Handy shows how men in terrible crises -- each day meant a struggle for food and warmth -- band together, develop freindships, and work to fight the enemy in the only way they possibly can. <br /> <br />Scrounging becomes an art. Nothing is wasted. Mundane activities take on new roles. A detailed description of a mouth-watering meal helps postpone some of the longings and deter the hunger pangs, if only for a short time. The men are disciplined, respectful mostly of expertise and professionalism (even from the enemy), and at the same time bond in a dark humor sort of way you would expect from dire circumstances. <br /> <br />There is also a remarkable amount of luck involved. But was it hard work and opportunity, or was it luck? Did the soldiers late in the war owe their lives to an enterprising prisoner who alerts the oncoming Patton army of the prisoners' location in an area about to be bombed by the American forces? Does the kindness of one guard show luck, weakness, or just that -- kindness? <br /> <br />This is an underpublicized, underappreciated, deserving-to-be-read history of men at war on a daily basis, and about the lessons they learn for a lifetime. Read it and give thanks.	2004-11-25

The Rage of the Left, the Truth, and What to Do About It	Books	3	16	24	N	N	Funny but flat	Ben Stein is a funny man, just not that funny. He is a well-deserved conservative with a string of strong, credible public stands on important conservative positions of the day. And I really wanted to like this book. <br /> <br />But there are too many personalized examples for my taste, maybe too many quotes from leftist cranks, and some statistics and citations that come out of nowhere. I'd like more careful and clear footnotes, detailed charts. Another 'Ben,' Ben Wattenberg does this -- taking a prosocial, even paternalistic stance for the common (conservative) good -- more effectively and convincingly in \\"The good news is the bad news is wrong' and 'The first measured century,' with all of the sagacity, a little less of the personal humor, and all the data needed to make critical points. <br /> <br />\\"Survive\\" is also a short, fast, almost light read. I finished quickly, feeling unconvinced that the authors had answered the question explicit in the title of their work. Maybe Stein and his co-author did a better job of answering the question, \\"Should America survive?\\" His basic answer, \\"education\\" is a highly risky proposition at best, because he makes clear with his story that family upbringing and values as well as an exposure to life itself may matter most than more formal forms of education.	2004-10-31

DuBois, activist Noam Chomsky, and others. Flynn is critical and uncompromising. He takes on ideologues from all walks of life, revealing lies, uncovering hidden facts, and putting a bright light on shady writings and biographies. His critique of Kinsey (Chapter 2: How a pervert launched a sexual revelution) is by itself worth the price of the book. Most troubling is how -- unexamined -- many of these lies and misleads have been institutionalized rather than examined. And some of these miscreants have been lionized or canonized rather than critiqued. <br /> <br />Above all, Flynn is interested in the triumph of truth over ideology. He laments the concern of the joiner (\\"Will it serve my cause?\\") and says, \\"We would all be better off if we approached untested assertions by instead asking ourselves, 'Is it true?'\\" Flynn closes by citing one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite questions, \\"If you call a dog's tail a leg, how many legs does he have?\\" Lincoln's answer to those who answer 'five' provides Flynnn's critical conclusion: \\"Calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg. Calling lies truth doesn't make them truth.\\" And, watching the political campaigns, we must note that calling truth-speakers 'liars' does not make the speaker a liar or his words lies. <br /> <br />For content and persistence, this merits five stars. But it is painful -- not joyful -- to read these revelations and this left me a bit mentally bruised in the end. This is a tough but important read.	2004-10-31

While the major forces of the American navy went after a diversion to the north, early on the morning of October 25, 1944 a powerful Japanese fleet surprised a much smaller American force protecting nascent American gains on Leyte. While historians will long argue the errors that led to this surprise, none can argue that the response from the American forces was dramatic, powerful, effective and almost suicidal. Yankee ingenuity, respect for their leaders, and old-fashioned stick-to-it-iveness made up in quality what the Americans lacked in quantity.    Three small destroyers dashed into harm's way and leveled mortal blows before they succumbed to withering, overpowering -- but often inaccurate -- Japanese fire. While some would flinch at calling these acts 'suicidal' against cruisers and battleships, the sense of purpose and patriotism, combined with the small chance that a good offense is the best defense seemed to drive these men to heights of fury and fight against the thunderstorm of Japanese ships.    Storms actually played a positive role in this fight, hiding both the smaller American ships, sometimes at lucky moments, as well as those pesky American fighter planes darting in and out of the clouds. But what really seems to have mattered was accurate firing, productive -- if incomplete -- intelligence, good leadership, and the absolute audacity of the crews aboard the American ships and planes. And timidity on the part of the Japanese admiral, believing he had stumbled upon a superior force of sull-sized carriers and cruisers, helped turn the onslaught into a full-fledged diaster for the Japanese, who lost perhaps 11,000 men to terrible but lesser casualties of fewer than 1,000 for the inspired Americans.    The research is thorough, with fascinating detail and first-hand reports from the battle and the men who fought it. Maps detailing the progress of this brief but spectacular battle helpguide the reader. Read it and respect the men who made this happen.	2004-09-07

He has given the term 'documentary' a whole new meaning and with his comical boorishness engaged a whole new generation of people with good reason to despise the American left. Anyone so loved by the French can't be worth noting.    Moore's 'truth' is to use clever editing and unsubstantiated conjecture to portray a story that does not exist, at least not in the manner he depicts it. Meanwhile, people who make mistakes -- basing decisions on the best information -- are liars. He claims that there is no terror threat, that terrorists should not have attacked New York City (because New Yorkers voted against Bush), that white American males were too afraid to take on the terrorists on their planes on September 11, and that only Saudi Arabia could have trained the September 11 pilot-terrorists. The amazing thing is how liberals and fawning media critics take this not only at face value but also as some form of strong, artistic truth or insight. If his 'documentaries' can win awards for screenplay (scripts for an unscripted story?) and for his misportrayal of facts, it is easy to see how his fans will also label The New York Times 'objective'. Let's get real.    The authors use work from many sources to destroy the credibility offered mindlessly to Moore by the artistic, liberal media. The truth is that there is 'no there there' once you examine the lies and simple, plain poor 'journalism' offered by this strange man.	2004-08-31

He is an accomplished general who made a career out of an initial, tentative choice. Under his leadership, the American military completed two large-scale, decisive actions in the Middle East. He shows a strong feeling for his soldiers and the expected discomfort with the press -- embedded or not -- and the armchair, retired brass who analyzed the two wars from afar. Franks has access to the facts and history; he does not have an axe to grind. He is pretty even-handed, even whe he criticizes the actions of others. Above all, he does not assign blame and he does share credit. He cites evidence and his own gut feelings about intelligence, the coalition, and weapons of mass destruction that will anger some of the Iraq war critics, but he is credible, if not inspiring. <br /> <br />Franks is the adopted son of a jack-of-all-trades dad who struggled with a variety of jobs and businesses to support his family. His dad makes the son a real hands-on type, willing to take on responsibility, to get his hands dirty, and to produce something of value. [Note: I read this book at the same time I read Tim Russert's \\"Big Russ and me\\" and found the useful father-son lessons to be both similar and different.] Moving around the Southwest in the late 1940s through to the 1960s, Franks' character has hardscrabble but not impoverished roots. He comes across as likeable and trustworthy. He went to school for a short time with Laura Bush in Midland, Texas. If he had the family connections, Franks might have been George Bush. <br /> <br />Franks' story covers his life, not just Iraq and Afghanistan. But that long military life taught him lessons and opened his eyes for what he needed to do as the general of a flexible fighting force. His experience with the post-Vitenam military is intersting in how it shows his ability to adapt and to lead at a time when morale waslow and misconduct was high. He coaches, cajoles, and provides consequences, e.g., show up in ship shape form for roll call and you earn that three-day pass; busts the drug dealers. He knows that it is quality, not quantity that matters most, a lesson whose value shows through clearly by the time he takes over and creates a functional, unified command. <br /> <br />His low-key, informed and involved leadership gets his staff and commanders to work well together, to succeed, to keep focused (\\"on target\\" is too much of a pun) and, most of all, to feel confident that they can do the work. <br /> <br />This is a good lesson in current history, both personal and global.	2004-08-26

I spent the first eight years of my life living two miles southeast of his boyhood home, not far from Holy Cross cemetery; my parents' first apartment was about four blocks south of Russert's Woodside home. We all went to Mass at Fr, Baker's Our Lady of Victory Cathedral. I watched the Bills regularly at The Rockpile, before they were fodder for national jokes about repeated failures. For these reasons and more, I enjoyed the sentimental journey back to Buffalo at a time when it was thriving, industrial, and blossoming with children. I think that every proverb Big Russ offered his son I heard from my dad as well, sometimes with the exact same phrase. The weather, the politics, the advertisements, the local stories all ring true and memorable. Russert is a local hero to beleaguered Buffalo, for his national visibility and regular recall to his roots.    But I have some misgivings. First, Russert calls himself a journalist which, to my mind, means that the woman who stands up at the Kiwanis meeting and asks her congressman pointed questions, or the fellow who attends the city council meeting and probes the council with skeptical queries, that they are journalists. Russert is a lawyer and a political aide and he used another old-time technique - networking - to find and take advantage of an opportunity. He's good and his South Buffalo roots and dad's advice make Russert unpretentious and likeable, but there is no reporting, no objectivity in being prepared for an interview of a famous person.    Second, given the emphasis on character, values and religion, I was shocked when Russert has to explain that his parents split after thirty years of marriage. Actually, he does not explain it. Yes, the book is \\"Big Russ and me,\\" not \\"Mrs. Russ and me,\\" but his mother deserved better. At least Big Russ could extend some of his wisdom to explain it to Little Russ.    Third, Russertspends his last chapter on the woes of the Buffalo Bills. A true blue Bills fan does not use their four straight Super Bowl (what an acheivement!) losses (okay, they're not perfect) to name drop national figures who bet on games with Russert. Russert mentions Cookie Gilchrist but real Bills fans remember Jack Kemp, Al Bemiller, Billy Shaw, Tom Sestak, Mike Stratton, Butch Byrd and all the working class heroes of the Bill's glory days, well before O.J. Simpson came upon the scene. This would have been a better chapter written about those heroic Bills and set in the early part of the book, not as a tail end thought.    The stories offer some reasonably interesting insights into life in South Buffalo. The writing is like Big Russ: clear, direct, and not complex. Much of what Big Russ has to say is pretty standard for his generation. He seems to be hard working, straightforward and candid. He keeps Little Russ on the straight and narrow and reminds him of his roots.  The purpose of the book is to provide some guidance for Little Russ' son. Luke, but the advice is mostly lukewarm.    A final note: Wise Big Russ tells Tim that a man who lies about his military record will lie about anything. So who are the Russerts supporting for president this year?	2004-08-25

Moving quickly through the New York dot.com landscape of the year of the bubble burst, Williams uses his own experience (including perhaps his undergraduate major) to write a story that kept me turning the pages from start to finish -- with great interest -- in one satisfying day. <br /> <br />The ensemble cast includes the functional (and, at times, dysfunctional) protagonist, Brad Smith, the PR vice president for a content-free start up. We never really learn or need to know what it is they are selling; this makes for a good parable about the entire dot.com mirage/mania. Smith provides the central point to the strange populace from his firm, including the duplicitous general manager, the former stripper turned PR assistant, the Middle Eastern investor, the oversexed personal assistant, and the nerdy tech guy. They are an interesting crew and Smith stumbles aimlessly, drunkenly for much of the novel before finding some light at the end of the dot.com tunnel, most of it from a fellow traveler who wants something quite different than what Smith seems to be seeking. <br /> <br />In a parallel world, Nicole Garrison, aspiring actress, leaves her unfaithful boyfriend, spurns a calculating but clueless Wall Street type, earns her big break, loses it, and...well, let's not give away the entire plot. <br /> <br />The crash of the greedy, paper-rich Internet employees of the end of the last century provides good fodder for a \\"Bright lights, big city\\" like romp through the bars, bedrooms and refurbished office space that makes New York such an interesting setting for the book, much better than any bone-dry Silicon Valley setting. The characters, perhaps based on Williams' own experiences in this era, may be a bit stereotypical, but they are fun to watch.

US	52891206	R1E4EA5DYF0RAS	0787968056	959862678	Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable...About Solving the Most Painful Problem in Business	Books	3	79	100	N	N	Compelling title, interesting parable, weak close	The title is provocative and will probably sell books. The parable of a software game firm in Monterey struggling with ineffective meetings makes for a reasonably readable, well-scripted (except for \\"our data is inconclusive.\\" p. 184) and intriguing story. \\"Death\\" has the air of \\"Disclosure\\" without the sex, as Yip Software allows itself to be taken over (cashing in -- a decision that probably warrants more attention than do the other matters in the book) and then scrutinized by a bigger firm. There is a late twist in the seemingly diabolic machinations of the larger firm and the catalyst to the correction in team decision making is imbued with a needless obsessive-compulsive, Tourette-like malady that allows him to have a psychological excuse -- when he is off his meds - to speak up at the meetings.<br />The parable reads well enough and early on reminded me of John Cleese's marvelous training film, \\"Meetings, bloody meetings.\\" The original video was so good when it was made almost thirty years ago that Video Arts updated it -- with almost the exact same script and several of the same actors-- ten years ago. \\"Death\\" is more current. But Cleese in both versions got it right, better, and funnier than Lencioni. He viewed team meetings as akin to a court proceeding or a trial. The analogy worked.<br />Effective meetings need critical thinking, not groupthink. The Senate report on the CIA is only the most recent example of no one taking a critical stance as partial information and unreliable data accumulate. But conflict does not seem to be the appropriate remedy for premature or inappropriate consensus. Lencioni is right: Real consensus is difficult if not impossible. But constructive critical thinking is better than conflict (or obsessives off their meds) to make a meeting effective and \\"interesting\\". Getting people to feel passionate about their work and their firm is important yet passion does not come from interesting meetings, picnics or stock vesting plans. The passion needs to come from somewhere else.<br />Cleese's film emphasizes the need to prepare and inform in a way that Lencioni apparently rejects for weekly \\"tactical\\" meetings: No agenda, says Lencioni. Lencioni uses an imaginative Holloywood metaphor to illustrate different types of meetings -- there are sitcoms, movies and miniseries parallels for meetings -- but this doesn't really work out for me in the end. The parable comes to an abrupt end and then Lencioni moves to a more formal, structured teaching style and my interest that had been waning disappeared.<br />I prefer \\"Death by chocolate\\" myself.	2004-07-11

Good idea. Buying this book to learn something about investing would be like buying the stocks Denby chose to make money. At least the reader's intentions or motives would be a bit more rational. Denby apparently has watched too many movies and read too many great books. What he really needed was some good common sense.    The title is misleading. Denby's entire downfall is not based on his being \\"American\\" or a \\"sucker\\". Yes, he was greedy and willing to be gullible. He waxes eloquent on greed and envy. But these are besides the point. Yes, he listened to precisely the wrong people. But his initial, critical, deadly mistake was to assume that he could make a million dollars in one year by not doing anything other than \\"invest\\". He was greedy, envious, naive, uninformed and lazy. He wanted so much to make that million that he ignored red flags, warning bells, and first-year business student advice on investing.    He has a cynical view of investing, based on Keynes' observations as to the risks involved. That pretty much explains how he thinks he can make a million in one year just by buying technology stocks in 2000. Denby also decides that taking risks means being irrational, that progress requires irrational behavior. What he fails to do is to listen even to the people who he indirectly accuses of having duped him; even Henry Blodgett told Denby to be more careful. Denby seems convinced that Alan Greenspan's effort to raise interest rates was the market's true undoing, This is a bad case of denial from the recent dot.com bust debacle.    Denby's self-absorption with his attempts to maintain his liberal, upscale, upper West Side lifestyle and apartment in the face of a pending divorce speaks volumes for his willingness to do incredibly foolish, shortsighted and greedy things makes this more of  a lesson in how not to dissolve a marriage than any sort of morality play, note of sympathy, or tale of snake oil salesmen swindling a poor, innocent, well-read but naive movie critic. It is hard to feel sympathy, even for such a large, personal loss.	2004-07-10

His early life receives a bit less. Born in 1916 in La Jolla, he had a lonely, almost dysfunctional childhood, including boarding schools, distant parents, a favored grandmother, a short-lived dog for a pet, and a University of California education. He quickly moves from college in California, to a scholarship to acting school in New York, to three short, failed Broadway plays, to almost overnight success in Hollywood, kicked off by his role as a priest in &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;.<br />But the story is more of a diary or summary of events, including things like profits from his La Jolla Playhouse venture, calculated to the penny. Casts of summer stock plays and Hollywood movies are cataloged. Every radio broadcast seems to merit a mention.<br />But the story is often a bore. Peck, who apparently had some form of editorial input to the book, chimes in at times with one-sentence descriptions of people, events, and movies, but it reads more like a scribbled note he added to the Fishgall's draft text. His life, including children, affairs and failed marriages, are sidelights.<br />If you would like a life catalog, read this book. For entertainment and a more human portrait, watch &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot;.	2004-07-10

Atkinson did fine work with \\"An army at dawn\\" yet this time it is hard to tell if he wants to be known as a journalist, a humorist, and historian, a simply a liberal Washington Post reporter.<br />Atkinson is observant but self-centered. His details include hygiene, passwords, idiosyncrasies and a lot of his own personal thoughts and feelings. While in the company of soldiers, he really does not tap the minds or souls of these warriors. He spends most of his time in the company of officers. He is worried more about his cell phone hook ups and the way his words play back in the States then he appears to be concerned with the men who are literally fighting, serving and protecting him.<br />For an historian, the story lacks nuance and context. The Iraqi regime and the build up to the war earn no real mention. Nothing is said of the terror produced by an Iraqi peace or the double-dealing nature of the UN food-for-bribes program and the German and French complicity in the hesitancy to fight. He belittles the coalition.<br />At times I have to wonder as to the value of the embedded reporter strategy. Does their presence change the behavior of soldiers and officers? Do the reporters really understand what they are seeing? Who is keeping an eye on them? Perhaps we should embed a few Rakkasans with the Post.	2004-06-03

Yet Shipler's book deserves a read. The profiles are well written, informative, varied, exhaustive, complex and illustrative. Compassion for the subjects is elicited and deserved. Some subjects struggle and do get by, if barely, due more to informal charity and kinship than by government (anti-)poverty programs. Their stories are especially noteworthy. Shipler's meticulous candor supplants Ehrenreich's solipsistic book, \\"Nickled and dimed in America.\\" Praised for its vicarious, first-hand account of other people's poverty, \\"Dimed\\" had no basis for useful insight. The life of poverty is no game, no short-term social experiment. Not pretending to be poor, Shipler is much more thorough; his first-hand journalistic research covers years, not months. He is objective and not judgmental yet his compassion shines through his words.<br />Shipler uses Churchill's description of democracy as the worst form of government to explain why capitalism is the worst form of economic policy - except when compared to all others that have been tried from time to time. A wise analogy. Yet the final analysis and public policy recommendations are difficult to  make or to decipher. Shipler acknowledges that the major cause of poverty can be attributed to a single source: bad personal choices. Of course, no one chooses to be poor (some journalists excepted), but people repeatedly make independent, self-serving or selfish, short-sighted, unfortunate choices, including walking away from the mother or father of their children, from their families, from educational opportunities, from their religious values, and from disciplined work habits. And they walk all too easily into a trap: teenage pregnancy, drug and domestic abuse, and endless hours in front of the television. As Shipler notes, what most poor Americans seem to have in common is high tv cable bills. Too often, government fails in its efforts to help. Despite the excessively complicated-to-claim earned income tax credit, Uncle Sam still takes too much of poor people's income in regressive, work-discouraging social security taxes and from employers by raising the cost to find, train, retain, and motivate ill-educated workers. And then the government tempts the poor with slickly marketed Ponzi schemes in the form of state lotteries, realizing the addictive nature of these rip offs that prey upon the poor.  And state schools expend $10,000, even $12,000, per pupil and produce illiterates with no job skills. Even health care is a form of governmental plague. Prevention earns little or no attention or funding from bureaucrats while cures and caring for the horrible consequences of poor nutritional and lifestyle habits are prohibitively expensive when it is available (more often than critics suggest), and leaving health care providers with exhorbitant malpractice insurance whose elimination alone could pay for health care for the poor. There are too many social and governmental barriers to and disincentives for making good choices and taking personal responsibility.<br />In Shipler's rich \\"Working poor,\\" you learn a lot about the poor. You just don't learn how to help reduce poverty.	2004-04-15
US	52891206	RISAMWHW84GT5	0670032212	514371665	The Vineyard: The Pleasures and Perils of Creating an American Family Winery	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Grapes of wrath	My parents chose to own and run a small vineyard. As a contemporary of the author, it is easy for me to empathize with the problems of building a vineyard from scratch. That may best explain why I picked up this book.<br />The author and her husband are of a blue blood vintage. Family money allowed them to embark on this experiment, quite the dilettantes at the start. Hargrave and her tall husband had tried other ventures or career options, including an organ (and I don?t mean Wurlitzer) cookbook. My stomach is still turning at the thought. Nothing seemed to click. The two were peripatetic students, travelers, house sitters, Ivy leaguers, quasi trust fund babies, with colorful roots of their own. Louisa Thomas is the grand daughter of five-time Socialist candidate for president of the United States, Norman Thomas.<br />One thing they learned from their stab at cooking organs was that the wine allowed the unpalatable food to go down a whole lot better. Inspired in part by this finding, along with a desire to forego hard liquor, husband and wife made a go of starting a vineyard on Long Island. Only this time the process was very serious, engaging and almost enslaving. They mastered the delicate, detailed process of acquiring the right vines, grafting, plucking, fermenting, storing and marketing the wine. They produced great wine; they earned (or at least somehow garnered) great publicity. They hired a lot of people with diverse, difficult and demanding backgrounds. Husband and wife divided the tasks as best they could, each to his or her apparent comparative advantage, she the hands on technician, he the business officer. Along the way, unintentionally it seems, they transformed themselves from soul mates to business partners.<br />Raised on a ?grape farm? myself, where my family lived twenty years, her story is spot on ? the planting and pruning, dealing with fungus and pesticides, curbing the weeds, managing the harvest, living with weather that both killed and enhanced the crop ? and evoked long dormant memories and, in some cases, wounds. Grapes are much less romantic when they go into jelly, but also a whole lot easier, especially if you don?t make the final product yourself. The Hargraves immersed themselves in the task. They learned fast, worked hard, and seemed to prosper, even if at times it was by the skin of their grapes. My initial skepticism turned to admiration but, having lived some of their life, never envy.<br />The saddest part of an otherwise noble accomplishment is the fact that the husband and wife efforts apparently killed their marriage. It is not very clear why. As the sole author, the wife is a bit coy on this. It may have been fruitful to read the husband?s side of the full story, not just the demise of a good, working partnership. This is a very human, humane story.	2004-04-09

J. O'Rourke, who has made a significant contribution to humorous travel writing. McCarthy is English-Irish and his affinity for his roots shows through his writing. He looks for and finds humor in the little things about travel - talk radio, second-hand cars, hitch hikers, tourist traps, off-the-beaten-path finds, bad food, good company, pleasant and unpleasant surprises, nosy hoteliers, apparent (to McCarthy and the reader, at least) ironies, rapid changes in the weather, obnoxious tourists, embedded cultural curiosities, and, well, you get the picture.<br />For an American reader, some of the history, terms, and geographic references are not unexpectedly foreign. Some humor and lessons are lost in the 'translation'. And McCarthy is pretty hard on American tourists in Ireland, although not noticeably harder on them than on other foreigners searching for quaint elements of Irish tradition or cheap land to buy. Hippies, yuppie Englishmen, rich Germans, and other demographic and ethnic groups earn his disbelief and, often, mild contempt. He catalogs the changes he has seen in Ireland in his lifetime, and many of them are not pretty. The Celtic Tiger has lost some of its charm and sold out some of its character to tourism and those eager to buy inexpensive land.<br />Consistently observant, funny and insightful, my one, major negative from the book is that it left me much less likely to visit Ireland. There may still be a chance to save the country from foreign invaders, so I'll do my part.	2004-03-31

Excellent books on the first two tragedies are now joined by another great study of the third.<br />Galveston suffered from a hurricane over one hundred years ago, perhaps 8,000 people died. The dam bursting in Johnston even earlier killed over 2,000 people in western Pennsylvania. The terrible fire that howled through northeastern Wisconsin on October 8, 1871 killed over 1,000 people and, by some estimates, killed more than the flood in Pennsylvania.<br />Gess and Lutz provide good background to the tragedy. This area of Wisconsin was booming due to the strong demand for lumber and the massive forests that covered the northern half of the state. Times were pretty good and getting better until the summer of 1871, when the lack of rain foretold a horrific fall. In hindsight, the inevitable, terrible combination of wood and fire may have been foreseeable. But not likely preventable.<br />Fire is an especially nasty force. Combined with extremes in the weather - low pressure, high winds, low humidity, lightning and a tornado - this was an especially pernicious threat and the cause of rapid, terrible death for hundreds and hundreds of poor, unsuspecting, fleeing people, some of them very recent immigrants.<br />The date of the event, its relatively rural location and the somewhat primitive communication and media of the time makes a complete understanding of the tragedy difficult yet Gess and Lutz work hard and admirably to dig up and re-construct weather reports, personal accounts, old newspapers, and other primary sources of information. There are fifteen pages of detailed and highly readable footnotes and scores of source documents cited.<br />There is always a tone of overwhelming sadness to such tales. Peshtigo is no exception. But it is fascinating history and well worth reading.	2004-03-31

Stop me before I editorialize again!	A primer for exposing journalistic fraud. With one example after another, Bob Kohn shows how the New York Times offers lessons on how NOT to practice objective journalism.<br />Journalism was never pure, professional or objective as some would claim or like to believe. Yes, journalism has exposed crimes, practiced freedom of the press, and serviced multiple causes, but having a degree in journalism or owning an independent newspaper does not appear to guarantee adherence to professional principles. In dissecting the Times, Kohn applies a simple professional process: Take an actual headline or lead, analyze it using basic journalistic standards (who, where, what, when and how), indicate the variations from the standard, and show how the faulty piece could have been easily edited to get the story straight and unbiased.<br />The American public needs to accept the fact that no newspaper leaves its editorial biases and interests to the editorial page. The examples of some journalism career paths are revealing in this respect: reporters become columnists, columnists become `analysts', newspapers make analysts `experts', and each move adds to the writer's income and book royalties, and new reporters are smart enough to see what pays best.<br />Yet newspapers claim to be objective or non-ideological in their reporting. As Kohn shows, you can't get past the bias, the distortions in the lead, the misleading headlines, the opinions, the labels (`ultraconservatives' on the right and `progressives' on the left; liberals do not exist), the loaded language, crusades, polls, and placement. Biased reporting describes an event using a misleading, passive voice, or claims without evidence or attribution an event as `staged' or `billed, or mangles simple factual stories, e.g., the non-looting of Iraqi artifacts. And then editors gloss over gross errors with buried, mealy-mouthed corrections. Sadly, such poor journalism is contagious, accepted and perpetuated as standard. <br />Here isan alternative: Build your own newspaper. Use the Internet. Read multiple sources. Establish a source's credibility and re-assess it often. Get several perspectives. Check blog sites. Look for clear confirmation, not second-tier papers lapping up and repeating the Times' biases.	2004-03-25

Brown either did meticulous research or he has a vivid imagination; the fact that I can't decide which or how much of each he used is a virtue of the book, not a flaw. Architecture, art and religion get a better, more thorough (if fictional) treatment than they receive in most popular novels. Either way, the details that form the background and motivation for the story worked very well for me. The story moves quite quickly. For most of the book - save one or two transparent plot twists - the Brown's story kept me turning the pages. This is a excellent basic premise and creative creation.<br />Now the bad news. The hype behind this book has been excessive. This is \\"Indiana Jones in Paris\\", with a melodramatic, frustratingly weak ending, and none of Jones' panache. The characters, especially the male and female leads, are humorless, colorless (readers of the book will detect the bad pun in this comment) and unable to earn my sympathy, interest or affection. Nelson DeMille does a much better job in this genre, with colorful, funny male leads and dashing, daring damsels. Jack Higgins used to write like this before he started to become repetitive. Some of the plot turns seem to be signaled well in advance. Without revealing them, suffice it to say, anyone with a smattering of knowledge about Da Vinci will easily see through one of the clues that sees to baffle our experts.<br />For those who find the book to be demeaning to or libelous of Catholics, Opus Dei or other real or fictional religious sects, all I can say is \\"this is fiction,\\" and leave it at that. Enjoy what you can of the artistic elements but be prepared for disappointment in the end.	2004-03-18

Much of the focus of the storm and the story is on the wealthy Hampton areas of Long Island and the Newport area of Rhode Island. Scotti sets the time and place well: the end of the Depression (with the damage still evident), the brewing war in Europe, and the start of the university school year. This storm came not only at an unusual time but also at unusual places. Much of the damage to homes is the result of wealthy people taking advantage of splendid if dangerous views of the ocean. Some of the dead are domestics left behind to shutter summer homes.<br />\\"Sea\\" offers a clear companion and comparison to \\"Isaac's Storm,\\" the epic of the Galveston hurricane of 1900. \\"Sea\\" is able to focus much more on the human element of the catastrophe, using interviews with survivors, photographs (fourteen glossy pages), and records that were just not kept in or saved from 1900. Survivors are alive today. \\"Sea\\" is more about the people who fought, including some who survived, the storm. In \\"Sea,\\" a smug senior forecaster in Washington, DC dismisses the hurricane forecast of an assistant, striking the word `hurricane' from the assistant's report for September 21 and leading to a lack of warning to the targeted, highly populated areas. The fact that such a storm was unique or that most of the Atlantic's similar storms pushed to the northeast and out to sea was not a good reason to ignore the disastrous consequences of the \\"Bermuda high\\" that kept the storm closer to land. The post-storm analysis may have been the real impetus for the modernization of weather forecasting. repairing the damage to railroads, telephone lines, livestock and roads helped usher in the modern age. Air passenger traffice between New York and Boston increased 500% in the week after the storm.<br />Scotti, a journalist and mystery novelist, uses words well. \\"Sea\\" is laden with brief, connected, poignant stories. Capturing the wildness of the sea and storms is no small task. Scotti even includes a brief set of scenes from the life of Katherine Hepburn from that day: swimming and golfing in Connecticut, before seeing her estate, Tara, being washed away. \\"Sea: has about five small maps; each could have used a bit more detail.

You now have spent thirty seconds and saved yourself money and the other fourteen-and-a-half minutes it takes to read the entire book.<br />Should we be grateful that leadership can be expressed so concisely and learned -- no, mastered -- so quickly? Or should we wonder who would pay a full-book price for 112 very short pages? Or should we wonder when the authors say, \\"The focus group data is (sic) compelling?\\" (p.3). Five-star reviews come from people in the first category.<br />The parable is full of sweet, easily transformed people, coming alive after years of mistreatment by management, brought back to life by a simple yet incredibly powerful act or word from \\"The Effective Leader\\". There is little to be generalized from these simple, simplistic cliches.<br />This is a variation on the incredibly successful \\"One-minute manager,\\" which had similar characteristics to an article entitled, \\"McGregor\\" a few years earlier in \\"Organizational Dynamics,\\" espousing one-minute praise, punishment and goals. In this case, Blanchard and Muchnick describe a people-oriented, empowering leadership model and contrast it with the pill-induced, autocratic, domineering, results-oriented style they attribute to \\"Patton, Napoleon and Attila the Hun.\\" Suffice it to say, the pill doesn't work. It's poisonous. Like heroin, it gives the leader a rush of power and grandeur, but only until the followers get pretty sick and tired of ego tripping.	2004-02-14

And his premise is this: Look beneath the conventional wisdom, the punditry, and the media hype and find that America works pretty well if not very well. While many people think that America is declining in status, prosperity, or value, the underlying conditions, trends and facts are much more positive. Yes, some social behaviors and standards are declining, but these are areas where \\"values matter most\\" and attention to values first, money or politics second, can drive a positive agenda for any political party. Key aspects of America's welfare -- education, crime, health, family and income support -- require attention, but not necessarily (significant) infusions of cash. \\"Family\\" values -- stable marriage, a working parent, supervised and loved children, parental support of education, safe streets, and some sense of discipline and duty -- are an integral part of the analysis. Attend to and enhance the social fabric.<br />Wattenberg blends a smooth, witty style with substantial and substantive data to make his point, without being preachy, even if he does at times come across as a bit \\"grandfatherly\\".

The story is compelling and seemingly complete, thorough; Bradley offers a lot of history and context, compassion and forgiveness as well. It is also a tale of mind-numbing sadness with a few glimpses of heroism, courage and charity. Many of those who volunteered heroically to fight after Pearl Harbor paid a dreadful price.<br />In one respect, \\"Flyboys\\" is the story of six young men paying that price - some of them boys, really - who fought and died terrible deaths on and around a tiny scrap of rock located in the remote Pacific, an island strategic in importance to winning the war despite its tiny footprint. In a larger sense, it is about the air war in the Pacific, especially in the last year of the war with Japan. It is also a source of perspective, offering sobering glimpses of man's inhumanity to man, be he oriental or occidental.<br />Bradley describes the evolution of Japan that led it to Pearl Harbor in the first third of the book. The middle third generally describes the role of American air power in this theater and provides brief, faded glimpses of the focal characters that cast their lot in small airplanes and realized their horrific fates on the tiny island of Chici Jima. <br />The pivotal point for the book is the deaths of the six. Months of training ended with a few well-placed antiaircraft shells. And crashing was the least of their problems. The slaughtered men's families were long spared the details and, reading this, you are grateful for ignorance. Yet the story grows more unrelenting, with the March 9-10, 1945 fire bombing of Tokyo. The hundreds of thousands of Japanese who died from starvation, disease, and their own self-inflicted discipline of death with honor and pride greatly outnumbered those fought in traditional combat.<br />Initials thoughts of Japan as \\"pure evil\\" - by the author as well as the reader -- give way to a more balanced perspective. Bradley does a nice job of showing that war crimes, hatred and inhumane treatment are acts that are usually decried, but they often come back as a form of justifiable revenge, the cost and inevitable consequence of war. Readers searching for a story of black and white, good and bad, are not going to find it here and that will leave some readers not only disappointed, but angry and incredulous.<br />I came away from this book quite depressed.

In addition to setting aside misconceptions (the artist bent over backwards rather than worked on his back), King adds all the rich tones and elements of this turbulent and colorful era.<br />In Michaelangelo's day (the end of the fifteenth and the start of the sixteenth century), Rome was still recovering from years of neglect. Vain and often unscrupulous popes at times advanced Rome and, at other times, took the city a few steps backwards. Ill-gained wealth paid for much of the great art. Proud popes built tombs, churches and cathedrals as memorials to themselves. Michaelangelo's patron, Julius, tried to undo some of the art work of his predecessor, a man who apparently at one time attempted to poison Julius.<br />As King writes, Rome was populated primarily by priests, pilgrims and prostitutes. As King did admirably in his telling of the story of the construction of Il Duomo in Florence, he again conveys the human element behind the sweat, genius and tumult. Intricate details about producing the most difficult art of the fresco, the daily accounting of the work, the intrigue among the assistants, the papal retinue and the two primary actors (pope and artist) breathe a life into the ceiling that comes to explain if not match the glory of the chapel work. You feel you can smell the animal dung, hear the assistants murmuring near their master, see the wet plaster transforming, and celebrate the triumph of human effort guided by God's hand.<br />Michaelangelo was petty at times, also often paranoid about his competitors as well as his assistants and patrons. He was also a pius man, a devotee of the rabid monk Savonarola and a man willing to read signs from floods, illness and other natural acts. Much of the time Michaleangelo feared for his life from seen and imagined enemies. The human miracle is how the artist triumphed amidst these real problems. Ross' triumph is in capturing this story in a highly readable, engaging style. Thank you.<br />Be sure to read this book before you set off on your own pilgrimage to Rome and the Sistine.	2004-01-13

Higgins is a well-oiled, formulaic writer, able to produce simple, direct sentences, basic emotions, and some color, using a relatively standard set of \\"high\\" elements. In this case, using foggy London, the stormy Irish Sea, forested Germany, and Middle Eastern deserts, he provides some set pieces of almost chivalrous interaction among the caricatured cast: the reformed IRA member, the London mobsters, the head of a shadowy British counterintelligence unit, the crippled computer wonk, the very attractive Oxford assistant, the noble Nazi, the secretive Swiss banker, the out-of-wedlock son, and the elderly one-time secretary to Hitler. Both sides of the battle have polite face-to-face meetings where they swear they will kill each other. What are they waiting for? Characters reveal incredible skills with obscure or unrelated tasks, from playing the piano to speaking multiple languages to working explosives. Sean Dillon could be James Bonds' darker side, or brother abandoned at birth.<br />Moving quickly across time and place, Higgins's prose is as sparse as Hemingway's yet without any of the emotion or power. The \\"emotional event\\" that drives the protagonist, seems small and insignificant. Higgins is more fascinated with food (lots of bacon and eggs), hotels (the Dorchester), restaurants, booze (make it Bushmills), weapons (everybody loves their Walthers), estates (German, of course) and haunts (pubs, night clubs, swank clubs, the London docks) than with his paper mache characters. Even his layout is thin: 282 pages, large font, extra spacing between lines, blank pages between chapters and sections. This is a quick read because the story is so short. Even the stereotypic plot 'device', the Hitler diary, has no real use in the story. remove it entirely and you lose little of the story.<br />One starfor weaving a credible (if poorly researched) story and another for making it easy to digest. But that's it. I'm swearing off Higgins.	2004-01-04

Contrary to the negative review from the Swedish \\"assassin\\", globalization works. The assassin's list of dysfunctional democracies is, even at its worst, a list of democracies and, contrary to his opinion, examples of good progress towards economic and political freedom.<br />Globalization has become capitalism without borders. Capitalism means the right to own and the right to trade -- freely. The problems have more to do with what can and can not cross borders in a world economy where geopolitics and terrorism limit the rights or possibilities of people to move freely. There is still a strong urge to maintain national integrity and the natural defense of one's borders and culture. And, given the choice, people head for countries with greater economic and political freedom, not just where the natural wealth and resources exist. People are now the world's greatest resource and they are more mobile than ever.<br />Norberg pulls together multiple, massive statistical studies of real progress in the world resulting from greater political and economic freedom. They go hand in hand. They serve the liberation not only of countries and cultures, but also women who, one hundred years ago left any country short on its claim of true democracy by prohibiting them the ballot and/or the right to economic freedom and ownership.<br />David Landes' \\"Wealth and poverty of nations\\" made this case from an historic perspective. Countries and their people and institutions need to be able to produce things of value, educate their young, innovate in their methods, emulate success, discriminate based on merit, and allow people the right to retain (some or much of) the fruit of their labor. Globalization and capitalism, like democracy, are the worst of all possible forms of economics, except, as Churchill advised, for all other forms of economics that have been tried from timeto time.<br />All these data and global views can be a bit dry at times and it should be safe to assume that English is not Norberg's first language (although he writes better than most American university students with English as their first language!) yet it is well worth the detail. He questions conventional (i.e., casual) wisdom. Anecdotes are illustrative and global.	2004-01-02

The evidence is pretty well known and difficult to refute, especially for those who read &quot;Bias&quot; and wanted more.<br />My major if sole objection is to Goldberg's game plan to correct this arrogant bias. He provides a twelve-step program for those media elite drunk on their own arrogance when, in fact, there is a simpler, more direct solution. That is cut off the alcohol. In other words, as many people have done, turning off the television, cancelling their subscriptions to the NY Times, and carefully constructing their own new media from blogs, talk shows, churches, and conservative books, the clear way to dry out the media elite is to simply ignore them, and to find a better way. And that seems to be happening already. The market for ideas and news has shifted.	2004-01-01

He describes himself as \\"staunchly\\" pro-life but he couches choice in the limited terms of \\"if you choose to have sex, you can't then choose to have an abortion.\\" Abortion seems to be fine with him for cases of rape, incest and the mother's health. This might be his idea of being enlightened but it is not \\"staunchly\\" pro-life or anti-abortion. He uses this approach to build his case for \\"personal responsibility\\". Choosing sex partners carefully may be a form of personal responsiblity but it is not pro-life.<br />He shops for a new religion to please his next wife-to-be, leaving any seriously religious person a bit slack-jawed at the process he employs to please his intended (sort of \\"Hey kids, let's go find a religion!\\"). His story of his descent into alcoholism and modest recovery to be a \\"star\\" (although I admit to never having heard his name prior to reading this book) is mildly inspiring but not very informative, humorous, or revealing.<br />After the first twenty pages of cliches, swipes at the typical conservative targets -- Hollywood, politicians, the media, Barbra Streisand, Michael Moore -- and a stream of consciousness that amounts to nothing more than platitudinal punditry, you have to wonder what \\"heartland\\" Beck is writing about. He's smarmy and nostalgic but not well spoken.<br />Save your money. For a better if unintentioned perspective on the heartland, read Bernie Goldberg's \\"Arrogance\\".	2004-01-01

Intimate stories and intricate details abound. Any author who can describe chemolithoautotrophic hyperthermophilic archaebacteria (p. 360) or will include the note about an a scientist who found that \\"that the weight of insects devoured by British spiders in an average year exceeds the total weight of all British people combined,\\" (p. 362) has a penchant for detail that at times goes over the edge. If you are a scientist, especially a geologist specializing in plate tectonics (which is what really explains Krakatoa but doesn't make it very interesting), than you should enjoy this book. Others need to be forewarned and armed with a disposition for detail.<br />The August 27, 1888 eruption of Krakatoa, popularized by many `anti-environmentalists' as the single most powerful, destructive and filthy case of pollution ever recorded, actually gets relatively short shrift here, in one long chapter, Chapter 8. Ships are tossed about, people run for their lives in the face of giant waves, and the sounds of the eruption are heard hundreds of miles away. We read about the circus in town preceding the event (Chapter 7), including the small elephant housed in a hotel room. There are some ominous connections between Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism and natural disasters like Krakatoa that merit further development for those curious about connections to today's Indonesian politics. Two of the three prefacing maps are a bit confusing, making it hard to immediately locate and isolate the volcano; on the second map it is difficult to separate the land from the water. One later map is so tiny (cf. p. 229) that even a magnifying glass may not help the determined reader.	2003-10-14
US	52891206	R1V9GF26480OM9	0743216423	178472357	The Battle for Rome: The Germans, the Allies, the Partisans, and the Pope, September 1943-June 1944	Books	5	5	8	N	N	The sorrow and the pity of Rome	This is an engaging, rich book about heroes and horror, about triumph and tragedy, about ego and humility, and about acting out and remaining silent. From July 1943, when the Italian army effectively exited the war, until the Allies -- Brits, French, American, Polish, African -- almost egomaniacally raced each other to enter Rome before D-Day in Normandy, Rome, the Vatican and the papacy suffered through their greatest threat since the Dark Ages, occupied by a sometimes charming, always cunning, and commonly cruel German force of occupation. The position  Pope Pius appears to have assumed, especially as to the round up of Roman Jews and the horrific massacre in the Ardeatine caves, is the center of the controversy for this thorough, multi-faceted view of the occupation. Taking advantage of unique, timely if belated access to Vatican and other secret files, Katz weaves  a story that captures the humanity and the terror of these twelve awful months in the history of the city.<br />Katz's work involves a detailed cast of  priests, diplomats, partisans, Romans, Allies, Nazis, with an especially helpful listing of them at the opening of the book. He closes with a summary of his legal battles with the niece of Pius XII (over Katz's accusations of the Pope's silence and implied complicity) and a nice, tight chronology of these troubled days. While the focus is on Rome itself, Katz describes the exhausting battles up from the south of Italy and the Allies' failure to grasp a major opportunity at Anzio in January 1944, when an American officer found that they could have probably driven straight into Rome on the day of the landings. Instead, the Germans regrouped and held out, the Americans hesitated and bled, and the citizens of Rome starved and waited four more months for the Allies to arrive.  The partisans, expecting the imminent arrival of the Allies, worked to thwart the Nazis, yet faced terrible odds, gruesome torture, and little support or rest. And the partisans bickered among themselves; some even betrayed others for money. In the midst of the carnage and uncertainty, one partisan couple finds love and rebirth. And, in the aftermath, some (perhaps too few) are called to be accountable for their actions.<br />Pope Pius appears to have favored a passive resistance and even a peaceful settlement between the Germans and the Allies, over the possibility of godless communism and the destruction of the Eternal City. It is hard to see how the Nazis could be accommodated and tolerated, or how they could be expected to treat Rome as an open city. Katz offers an illustration at the end of his work: After the siege of Rome in June 1944, Pius was not happy with the Allies parking a tank near one of the Bernini colonnades, so according to Katz, 'the Pope telephoned the Vatican secretariat three times to have the tank removed.' Katz wryly notes: 'Continual denunciations of Allied violations would get him nowhere now. They might have had a greater moral force had he begun with the Germans back in September [1943]'. As Eric Sevareid noted, the Pope, 'took credit for the fact that the city had been spared.' But could he, should he, did he do more to save lives? The calculus is almost too much to contemplate. While Pius remains a candidate for sainthood and admired by many, Katz raises troubling if not conclusive images of an all too human man.	2003-10-05

This brief (222 pages) diary covers October 2002 through April 2003, reported by National Public Radio's Anne Garrels, interspersed with e-mails from her husband, who sent updates on her whereabouts and actions to her friends around the world. Most of the action takes place in Baghdad. The run-up to the March war has Garrels struggling (without much success) to find reliable information and trusted assistants. Language is a huge barrier. Cultural differences are almost as big a barrier. Intrigue and torture by the government makes conclusions almost as unreliable as the raw data. Who can you believe? Did the interpreter interpret the story accurately? How filtered and restricted is her access to sources? Is the source who he says he is? After about four months of uncertainty, the war is over faster than anyone expected. After some short-term Baghdad belief that the Iraqis will hold, their defense folds like a shabby card table. The resulting chaos should not be surprising. The messages she hears and sees are often unclear, inconsistent and contradictory: Iraqis love Saddam, Iraqis hate Saddam; Americans are welcomed, Americans are despised; American bombs hit civilians, Iraqi defenses hit their own civilians; a wounded man is a civilian, the doctor says he is an officer lying to the reporter. It is impossible to decipher the truth. Even with all this technology, the fog of war is compounded to the bitter end by the cruel, petty banality of the Hussein regime. Straightforward stories get reversed and revised. Remember the idiotic information minister claiming that the Americans were not occupying the airport? Some lies become part of the history of the war. Late in her story, Garrels reports on the now debunked story of the looting of the national museum. She notes other reporters and networks who made significant compromises to stay in country; some of these compromises kept them there but made the stories of questionable veracity and ethics.<br />This collection ofmemories is more about reporters, reporting and technology than politics and war. Journalism under these conditions is more than challenging. Reporters have to bribe, lie and cajole; it is easy to imagine (oaky, let's just assume) that those whose stories are being told are doing much of the same. Garrels is assisted by a quasi-stringer, her minder/interpreter/driver who, at times, is her eyes and front-line reporter. Like the memorable film on Cambodia, \\"The killing fields\\", the American reporter is able to do her work primarily because of and through the work of a 'trusted' local who, only later do we find, is not at all what he claimed to be. And the American moves on to another task.<br />Garrels has contempt for some reporters (e.g., Dan Rather, Geraldo Rivera, an anonymous network bimbette in a tight t-shirt, French journalists who use their feminine guile to orally seduce a minister), general respect for one (John Burns), and no use for those who arrive late to the scene. She is a technical whiz, keeping her cell phone, satellite connection and tape recorder running on car batteries and tape. Garrels was certainly brave, fascinated by the war, yet at times she seems incredibly optimistic about her rights or expectations as a foreogn journalist, regularly surprised or just unhappy at how poorly she is treated, sexually assaulted, expected to pay bribes. She acts like she should have immunity from nervous young soldiers and misplaced missiles.<br />This book will revive many already dormant memories about a cruel dictatorship and a brief, formal war followed by a chaotic, dragged out denouement.	2003-09-28

His Boswell is Fred Tell, the VP of Human Resources, who ought to know better. Tell offers his view as a seemingly disinterested observer, only to become uninterested about the time the book becomes uninteresting. Tell presents the first third of the book as history and background. For example, a boss says \\"take out this trash\\" and CarolAnne thinks it is aimed at her personally. Harb, hearing heavy pounding outside his office, asks  her what she is killing, and she claims he's accusing her of having an abortion. You get the picture. The multimillion dollar lawsuit and trial follow and then a relatively brief conclusion. Tell describes the accuser, CarolAnne (one word, capital 'A') in physical terms while he also praises her incredible work talents. She has excellent work skills, is apparently very overqualified, but she has a load of personal and work history baggage that even a naïve HR assistant would not fail to question. But first Harb, and then others, are smitten by her combination of knockout skills and miraculous work output, and the rest, as they say, is history. The biggest problem seems to be that his firm hired in haste and then repented at their leisure. And boy, are they leisurely. At times, the firm's management makes Richard Grasso's directors look like a bunch of Ebenezer Scrooges. Salaries are astronomical, raises are rapid, and expense accounts, well let's just say that Harb casually assumes his $15k a month expense account habit will be supported for most of his first year following his termination. And Bing makes the corporate quality movement something trivial and a passing fad, an apparent demotion for Harb to get the head job and an office quickly closed when times go bad. So much for corporate quality.<br />The best insight here comes from the judge at the trial. Unfortunately, he has about ten lines throughout the book, including transcripts from the trial that are intermingled with the narration. There is little need to describe the moronic behavior of the opposing lawyers or the outcome of the trial. There is humor in some of the characters and their actions and some insight into corporate life. Even the loser at the trial seems happy. By the end, the only victim in this book is perhaps the reader.	2003-09-20

Actually, fanatics, crazed, zealots, insane boosters and other, even stronger words come to mind to describe the town's commitment, The pending death of the coach gives reason for a goodly number of his 700-plus former athletes to come into town. Neely - the knee-damaged super quarterback of the stunning 1987 state championship -- is back, for the first time in a long time. He, not the dying coach, is the center of the story.<br />Supporting Neely is a good array of colorful characters, high school jock stereotypes - the gangly, misfooted punter who later comes out of the closet and now owns a book store, the star receiver now managing the local bank, the convict, the ex-convict, and the current sheriff, the scrawny back who suffers a terrible fate, and more. And there is the memory of the perfect, dumb, devilish, blonde cheerleader, who is out of town but on the mind of more players than just Neely. She took Neely away from another stereotype: the cute girl who grows up to be perfect. Neely can't forget her and she can't forgive him for leaving her for the legs and lungs of the vixen.<br />There is not much time to develop the characters, not in these few pages. Two threads run through the book: the death that led to the coach's firing and the mystery behind that 1987 state championship when, trailing 31-0 at the half, Neely and Silo (Yes, he's built like a silo; there's also one athlete named Hindu.) lead the team back for a miraculous win. Best of all, one alum drags out a tape of the second half, allowing a radio broadcast to magnify the mystery: Why did the coaches not return to the field for the second half.<br />The funeral and the final showdown with the jilted first love provide answers. While no great novel, and no great work of art, \\"Bleachers\\" offers a sweet trip down memory lane for any boy whoever fastened a leather chin strap on an old high school helmet, and who never got the girl, the championship, or the short-lived, bittersweet glory. And you can read it in ninety minutes. Or rent &quot;Everybody's All-American&quot; to watch Dennis Quaid play someone quite like Neely.	2003-09-17

He has surprisingly little to do on D-Day, wandering around swampy ground, gets in some very dirty work in Holland, and enjoys the spoils of war in Austria. There is clearly an element of Ernest Hemingway; Webster is better educated and literate than many of his comrades and seems to have looked to the war as a source of material. There is also a strong element of Ernie Pyle present; Webster suffers from 'chickens**t' leaders, bad decisions, wet foxholes, and a general contempt from and for authority. He promises to himself to never 'sir' anyone again after the war, although he has a few kind words for Band of Brothers lead character Dick Winters.<br />The bad news to report from this front is that there is also a bit of Ernie (as in Bert and Ernie) and the buffoonish character Ernest (from 'Ernest goes to camp' and other forgettable movies). Webster insists on being slow. He hates almost everything he is told to do, much of what he does, and most of those around him. A few, goofy buddies offer insights into the dark side of soldiering, from looting, to whoring, to harassing the defeated German populace, while also shuffling and grinning through a significant part of his story.<br />Webster comes across as mean-spirited, unlike his portrayal in Band of Brothers and while he makes some reference to his education and wealth, it doesn't show. He makes little of the distance from his platoon when he returns in February 1945 after four months of convalescence from a flesh wound in Holland (and he's most sorry that it was no 'million dollar wound'). He comes across as constantly put upon, abused, and mistreated by his own army. Sure, much of military life allows and calls for grousing, and his company faced some pretty sorry times; it just seems repetitive and pointless. He probably deserved and he would have been better off with better instruction, information and leadership from his superiors.<br />His sense of sound, smell, weather and place is helpful to the reader. The way he describes the sound of different German shells and ordnance provides a better sense of presence to the inexperienced reader. But the story lacks a strong narrative. He jumps around from place to person without useful transitions. It would seem fair to conclude that he patched together (or did his editor, posthumously) diary entries capturing events in real time.<br />To one interested in and pretty well read in this genre, the text dragged and disappointed. Up close and personal this may be, it just left me surprisingly unsympathetic and bored.	2003-09-09

Steven Spielberg donated to the Bedford memorial.) The Americans were going to put eleven divisions ashore in Normandy -- ten of which had never seen combat --- most of them after a stormy crossing of the English Channel, the last eleven miles in small, pitching landing craft. Planners estimated casualties of 25%. For the small town of Bedford, Virginia, population 3,000, things were going to get a lot worse, very fast. By noon, 19 young men from Bedford were dead. More would die later in the month. June 1944 was a disproportional tragedy for Bedford.<br />Kershaw takes us from the formation of the company in the 1930s to interviews with the survivors sixty years later. The three years leading up to D-Day earn the most attention. Following the number of men killed makes the story difficult to write and to follow at times. There are so many names, stories, and relationships, and many of the characters are dead and those who remember have fifty- or sixty-year-old memories. Nonetheless, Kershaw brings the people and their stories to life. Kershaw's story and style reminded me of the memorable \\"Flags of our fathers\\". The stories of rigorous training, demanding officers (especially Norman Cota and Charles Canham), preparing in England, dying with other heroes -- had the sepia tone of HBO's Band of Brothers.<br />Most of the men of Bedford's Company A enlisted in the local National Guard unit in the Depression. Sharp uniforms and training pay were attractive alternatives for an impoverished time. Few of the men ever expected to go to war. Some of their parents resisted letting the young men join the unit. After D-Day and years later, some questioned as to whether the poor soldiers of Virginia were cannon fodder for war profiteers. Kershaw allows the survivors to wonder or comment about the decision to send young, untested men into battle: Should experienced troops been at the lead? Should, could -- Eisenhower have waited for better weather? Could the navy and air force done a better job of softening up the defense? Should the landing parties have been required to carry sixty pounds of pack? Was the intelligence about the defenses bad (better German units replaced poorer ones only days before) or shaded (some were told it would be 'a cake walk')? And several people offer different perspectives on heroes: Were they all heroes on Omaha Beach? Or was it those who died? Or was it those who returned home and had to live with and explain the memories? Or was it the families of the dead men? Some chose September 11, 2001 as a moment to realize the magnitude of the localized loss.<br />Reading the entire book in one day made me realize how compelling and moving a story could be. We need to read and remember yet also reflect on both the heroics and the humanity of such personal and patriotic history.	2003-08-20

Only some years later did it become clear that formal war declarations began almost twenty-seven months earlier, in September 1939. It seems likely that many Americans, especially with our poor or incomplete knowledge of history labored (and some continue to labor on) under the same misconception.<br />Moss does a wonderful job of filling such a gap in an understanding of the Great War. There was a 27-month delay between England's declaration of war on Germany and Germany's declaration of war on America (Another refresher: On December 8, America declared war on Japan, not Germany; four days later, Germany declared war on the United States for the Nazi ally.). More critical the conduct of the war were these nineteen weeks of 1940, generally commencing with the escape from Dunkirk in May and concluding with the deciphered message in late September that Hitler had called off the airborne invasion troops, signifying the delay (and, eventually, cancellation) of the invasion of England across the English Channel.<br />Under the Nazi wave of terror, England and much of the world were pretty grim in early 1940. Moss shows how much of the change foe the better came about from the slow if certain evolution of America from an isolationist country, to an anti-Nazi sentiment, to a pretty solid pro-British sentiment by late 1940. At one desperate moment, England and France considered unifying under a single government. Even the pessimism of Joe Kennedy, the American ambassador to England and father of future president John Kennedy, could not match the determination of the English. This was their \\"finest hour\\" and Winston Churchill personified their ability to stand up to the seemingly inevitable Nazi win.<br />More than sixty years have passed and it leaves some believing that eventual Allied victory was preordained. While the seeds of victory were planted in acts likethe miraculous Dunkirk exodus, the decision by Roosevelt to send fifty desperately needed destroyers to submarine-ravaged England, and the strategic misfire by Hitler to leave behind the RAF airfields and to bomb English cities, victory was no foregone conclusion, no Hollywood-like heroics just waiting to be written. This was a highly uncertain, life-and-death struggle. <br />When the Blitz - a shift to terror bombing of London -- commenced in early September 1940, much of London life went on, albeit with some adjustments. Morale remained persistently high. Few people cracked under the pressure, despite the unprecedented bombing deaths of first hundreds and then thousands of English began. Some people relished the uncertainty and the struggle to survive and to triumph. The adrenalin ran high despite the grey, smoky days and flame-filled nights. By war's end, twenty percent of English casualties were civilian, many of them living in their own homes. By German and English estimates as to the devastation produced were too high. Economies and people managed to work through the worst imaginable. Using diaries, newspapers, public opinion polls and observations, Moss weaves a highly readable tale of life, shifting from continental Europe as the early stages of the war unfold, and moving to England and America during that fateful summer, focusing primarily on Roosevelt and Churchill but, more enlighteningly, offering detailed glimpses of domestic policies and people in both countries doing that critical time. From British propaganda to an analysis of the isolationist and pro-British movements, Moss creates a time and place feel for that summer which, by all accounts, was a glorious, dry, blue English summer that year. Another note: With war, the daily weather forecasts became a matter of national security, so most Englishmen could only experience the weather, not hear a forecast. The end of the war marked the return of broadcast weather forecasts.<br />Moss has to start abit slowly. These nineteen weeks are preceded by years of recrimination and stubbornness resulting fro the first Great War. He explains the context for these memorable nineteen weeks. Most important to our generation and to history, he shows that perseverance in the face of adversity was not only critical, it was not always welcomed. Many soon-to-be-Allies - French, English and American -- would have accepted a peace with Germany in 1940, mostly in German terms. Few would have predicted in that same year that the tables would turn completely within five years. Moss provides a useful, smooth (although by now also pretty well known to many and well known to historians of this war), journalistic coverage of this important time.	2003-07-28

Lewis blends a love of the game, with a desire to really understand what it takes to win and the lives of some of those who make it all happen. <br />Lewis makes a clear case for competent management in baseball or, as featured general manager Billie Beane points out: In what other organization do you let the show be run by middle management. Or as another wag says: At age fifteen, most of what you now about baseball comes from announcers and eighty percent of what they know is wrong.<br />Oakland GM Beane has studied baseball as a process that produces results. And rather than count on traditional statistics, he learned that many of the things ballplayers and managers think are important just aren't that important. Using much of the Bill James approach (a baseball fan and analyst from Lawrence, Kansas who for the past twenty-five years helped re-invent the way we look at baseball), Beane appreciates batters who don't make outs and who have the patience to take a walk. Beane penalizes his minor league managers when their players fall behind in the walks per at bat ratio. Home runs matter more than stolen bases and sacrifice bunts. In brief, not making an out, e.g., a failed stolen base attempt, `manufactures' (a favorite baseball verb) more runs than does speed on the base paths. Getting on base and getting extra bases matters more than a high batting average. Pitchers have little control over what happens once a ball is hit into play. Walks, strikeouts and home runs matter more than ERA. While skill matters, luck has an even larger impact on the success or failure of each game.<br />And there are colorful stories of real people who don't fit the traditional baseball mold yet who make big contributions, truly undervalued assets, including A's minor leaguers Nick Swisher and Jeremy Brown, catcher-now-A's-first-baseman Scott Hatteberg and theA's underhand reliever Chad Bradford<br />My one small disagreement lies with the continuing myth that baseball is a monopoly. Major league baseball teams do not compete with one another the way competing firms compete. Rather they work in effect as regional offices of the same firm. Competing firms would be glad to put their opponents out of business; major league baseball would die if that were to be the case. The fact that teams compete on the field disguises the fact that teams are economically cooperating with one another. The teams compete against other uses of the fans' entertainment dollar, not one another. Major league baseball is not a monopoly; it is one big company operating in the entertainment or sports business. Even 'free' agents cost two first-round draft choices, and Beane shows how to put these to good use.<br />Lewis shows, however, that baseball can be rational, a process to be studied, understood and, most important, managed. Good management is essential to success. The A's, contrary to what Bud Selig says, are not an \\"aberration\\". Instead, they benefit from good management. In 2002, their division standings were exactly the opposite of the team payrolls. Management matters more than money. Economic inefficiencies can be ferreted out and exploited. Reliance on conventional wisdom and not on researched, reasoned analysis will produce a lot of expensive losses. Just look at the Orioles, Mets, Red Sox, and Dodgers. And then look at Minnesota, Toronto and Oakland.	2003-07-16

My naiveté.<br />\\"Naked\\" reads like P.J. O'Rourke's adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho\\". While O'Rourke is intelligent and insightful with his biting sarcasm and wit, Sedaris was simply dark and at times, cruel and mean, without the insight. His first chapter, \\"Chipped beef,\\" showed some promise. But by the second, \\"A plague of tics,\\" about a young boy with obsessive-compulsive disorder of a serious magnitude, I was nervously squirming, hoping that these were but rough spots. But then he moved to dumping on his grandmother, Ya-Ya (\\"Get your Ya-Ya's out\\"), and it became much more difficult to continue. Poor grandmothers. As if age alone was not cruel. Why have an ungrateful grandson to add to the trouble? His fourth chapter, \\"Next of kin\\" did not revive my hopes for some humor. Perhaps it was funny but it was more perverted than humorous. His next chapter, \\"Cyclops,\\" opens with, \\"When he was young my father shot out his best friend's eye with a BB gun.\\" Pretty grim. Within a page, it becomes internecine, as \\"my sister Tiffany stabbed me in the eye with a freshly sharpened pencil.\\" Then the father gives the story an even more perverted twist. The next chapter, \\"The Women's Open\\" was an improvement.<br />For better, funny dark humor, I recommend Martin Amis, Joseph Heller or the aforementioned O'Rourke.	2003-06-30

In the first three chapters, he quotes or cites himself, sales trainer Tom Hopkins, Mark McCormack, Victor Frankl (founder of logotherapy), Aristotle, Stanford University, billionaire H. L. Hunt, motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, Alexander Graham Bell, Eleanor Roosevelt, Buddy Hackett, Gary Zukav, James Allen, Edward Banfield, peak performer Charles Garfield, and Peter Drucker - an eclectic mix of anecdotes and attributions. But there is not much substance or structure. There are plenty of clichés like, \\"How do you eat an elephant?\\" Answer: \\"One bite at a time.\\"<br />He is brief if a bit too cheerful. For example, in Chapter Six, \\"Decide your major definite purpose,\\" his short paragraphs include headings like \\"Activate your Reticular Cortex,\\" \\"Red Sports Car,\\" \\"Achieve Financial Independence,\\" \\"Keep Your Feet on the Ground,\\" \\"Don't Sabotage Yourself,\\" and \\"Be Willing to Pay the Price.\\" <br />He recommends writing goals in the present tense but including a deadline, creating awkward conceptualizations of this sort: \\"I earn an average of $5,000 a month by December 31.\\" You need to be persistent but flexible, full of dreams but also practical. Dependability is your most important trait but there are many others cited as important, key or critical: your ability to set goals and make plans, a sense of control, the practice of single handling, dedication, vision, visualization, e.g., \\"ability to visualize is perhaps the most important faculty that you possess.\\"<br />His conclusions are twenty-one steps, which follow directly from his chapter titles, beginning with \\"Unlock your potential,\\" \\"Take charge of your life,\\" \\"Create your own future,\\" and ending with \\"Unlock your inborn creativity,\\" \\"Do something every day,\\" and \\"Persist until you succeed.\\" Perhaps you just need to read the conculsions.<br />The book is more about the subtitle \\"How to get everything you want - faster than you ever thought possible,\\" than it is about goals, goal setting, or developing an enduring goal-setting strategy. There is plenty of stimulation for the unread and moving stories about the author's own path to success.	2003-06-26
US	52891206	R2NSWH8XS9QSAQ	0767900561	957072334	Gulag: A History	Books	5	2	6	N	Y	Wretched truth of economic and political evil	Applebaum chronicles with fine detail and compassion, the profoundly sad, cruel, arrogant and evil system that represented the political and economic basis for much of the Soviet Union's life, a life built on forced labor and false accusations. She starts with the origins of the camps, provides a thorough picture of elements of the camps - transportation to the camps, conditions, women and children, reward and punishment, the guards, work and survival strategies in the camps, revolts and amnesties, and more - and then concludes with the demise of the camps. From 179,000 prisoners in 1930, and peaking at 2,356,685 in 1949, the entire, miserable story makes the reader both want to put the book down out of revulsion yet also read on to the bitter end.<br />From this morass of inhumanity arises a picture of Stalin's brutal belief in forging a `perfect' country by enslaving people to do his will, and to do it poorly at best. The labor camps were an awful and misguided effort to develop the country's resources at a time when natural resources - timber, gold, uranium - were seen as the primary source of wealth. Sadly enough, Applebaum shows that Stalin had the world fooled. He even led us to believe that harsh terms and conditions were necessary and not unlike the efforts made to develop the American economy. Even vice president Henry Wallace, deluded by a Potemkin-village experience to the camps, said: \\"There is nothing irreconcilable in our aims and purposes.\\" For those who want to see just how much the American and Russian systems differ, read this book. This is not simply a book about prisons. It is about a culture and a system, economics and politics, philosophy and practical decisions.<br />The wretched truth is that the attempt to use slave labor to build an economy is not only immoral, it is impractical. The saddest fact is that it took sixty years to realize that the gulag system did not work, just like the rest of the country did not work. The gulag became a microcosm for the country and, when offered `freedom', some of the camp prisoners reasoned that they were no worse off in the gulag than in trying to eke out a life in the Russian economy.<br />Readers must realize the difficulty Applebaum had to assemble this portrait, learning Russian and accessing the archives and distant camps. This is a life's work, indicative of the millions of people who suffered at the hands of the gulag system.	2003-06-23

Reads like the written translation of a coaching or motivational seminar. Chapters include &quot;Unlock your full potential,&quot; &quot;Double your productivity,&quot; &quot;Simplify your life,&quot; &quot;Enjoy superb health and fitness,&quot; and &quot;Become everything you are capable of being,&quot; among others.<br />For a book on one's 'focal point', there seems to be a lot of cliches widely dispersed throughout the book, e.g., the 20/80 rule, &quot;commit to excellence,&quot; &quot;Work harder at what you do,&quot; &quot;Identify your customers,&quot; and then &quot;Fire your customers.&quot; Tracy includes what he calls &quot;Perhaps the most famous mission statement of the twentieth century,&quot; as George Marshall said to Dwight Eisenhower, &quot;Proceed to London. Invade Europe. Defeat the Germans.&quot; I prefer the Hollywood version of Marshall, from &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;: &quot;He's alive. We're going to go in there and get him the he** out of there.&quot;<br />Tracy offers &quot;The Seven Rs of Simplification,&quot; which are actually seven &quot;Res&quot;: Rethink, reevaluate, reorganize, restructure, etc. All this simplification sees to get pretty repetitive, and complicated. It is good to simplify and to control, but it is not clear that simplification comes from redoing anything and/or everything. And offering &quot;Six steps to doubling your income and doubling your time off&quot; seems like a pretty simple, powerful idea, but it includes steps like &quot;Decide today to take at least one full day each week off work...&quot; Nice work if you can get it.<br />Tracy tells a story about his dentist who &quot;made a great sacrifice&quot; to attend a seminar in Hong Kong and, as a result of what he learned there, retired five years later a multimillionaire. We should all wish that life and wealth could be that easy. What about all the other people who attended the seminar? When will they offer it again?<br />To cut to the chase: The focal power of goals does work. Let's face it, if we really want to simplify, control and focus, success comes down to three things: desire, direction and discipline. &quot;Focal Point&quot; is a bit about the first, a lot about the second, and not much about the third. And it is all over the place. If you are looking for focus, look elsewhere.	2003-06-09

A comment in the Introduction caught my attention. Jennings writes \\"we were eager to avoid Tom Peters' embarrassment when a number of excellent companies sagged badly soon after publication...\\" Quick Google searches on three (there were more companies; I just did three) Jennings-commended companies (The Warehouse, Ryanair, and Nucor) read more like embarrassments as well. <br />To be specific:<br />The June 4, 2003 New Zealand Herald reported that \\"The Warehouse founder Stephen Tindall has stepped back into the company's day-to-day operations, leading a scheme dubbed Project Urgency to fix its Australian problems. ... Tindall is leading Project Urgency. Its aim, as the name suggests, is to give the Australian operation a rapid makeover.\\"<br />At the same time, Ryanair had its own problems. Per the web report: \\"Europe's fast-growing low-fare airline, dropped as much as 14.7 percent Tuesday after the low-fare airline said it expects lower fares and yields this year will pressure its profit margin.\\" The book may provide an explanation: Jennings lauds attention to customer service and satisfaction and chastises those who fail to respond to customers. As Jennings ironically notes: \\"Other than cheap airfares, customer service at Ryanair is nonexistent.\\" Queried by Times of London reporter as to the paper receiving \\"more complaints concerning Ryanair's customer service than any other airline,\\" Ryanair's CEO response: \\"We don't screw them every time we fly them.\\" Nice attitude.<br />A third featured company, Nucor, also turned south about the time Jennings went to press: Nucor's stock price dropped by half between mid 2002 and early 2003.<br />There is more I found unsettling: Jennings repeats canards about \\"eggs and ham\\" (the chicken's involvement and the pig's commitment), about showing prospects a heavenly version of product yet delivering hell, and about decentralizing fireworks production (avoiding one big explosion). He mimics Jim Collins's \\"Get the right people on the bus.\\" He follows Peter Drucker's ideas to produce the anagram, WTGBRFDT (\\"What's the good business reason for doing this?\\"). And Edwards Deming must be spinning in his grave when he reads Jennings: \\"The objective is to perform the task with zero variation.\\" (p.129)<br />The all-too-flattering biographies and profiles remind me of Fast Company or Inc. pieces. The book concludes with a self-congratulatory chapter recommending of Jennings' previous work, an epilogue featuring Jennings' personal trainer, and a lengthy section of acknowledgements that consists of name dropping more than links to research help. He commends his research team of recent graduates of Stanford, Princeton, and Berkeley yet he offers no systematic research, data, tables, graphs, analyses or standards. Jennings has a lot of ideas and inspiration, but little is substantiated. And, in another twist, the book is about more (productivity, profits, revenue per employee), not less. The final product is a watered down amalgam of \\"In search of excellence\\" and several other popular business authors and books.	2003-06-04

Quattro Giornate is an historic event; \\"Street Boys\\" is not. Some will say the book reads better as a screenplay; the Italians already made the movie, forty years ago. Books need to be copy edited for spelling, accuracy and consistency; \\"Street Boys\\" is missing some of this. Some want the book to be truer to the history or at least more realistic; \\"Street Boys\\" has battle scenes that read like a cross among \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"The Little Rascals\\", and the Hardy Boys.<br />Enter 'Quattro Giornate' along with 'Napoli' and '1943' in a Google search and you can find enough history to judge the relative accuracy of this book. If you're looking for historical accuracy, this book is not it. Men and women were more of a presence in the battle; the Germans were not the pathetic, Keystone Cops portrayed in the book. Naples was crushed, literally and figuratively, by petty, evil, vengeful Germans, but not without a fight, however small and however late.<br />The characters are cardboard. Picture Colin Farrell as the one-man American army. Select any llithesome, nubile, dark-haired, olive skinned starlet du jour to play Nunzia. Or a young Leonard DiCaprio as the partisan child leader, Vincenzo. But the scenery and weather are pretty, no matter how much desolation brought on by the war. The events are heroic and ripe for Hollywood over-the-top scenes, e.g., menancing Germans shot by amazingly accurate fire from untrained youths at the last second.<br />\\"Street Boys\\" could be a whole lot better. The story deserves better. But I would not dismiss this book, if only because the basic story should be remembered and writing your own screenplay in your head from a mediocre book is a much better exercise then watching a bad or even mediocre movie.	2003-05-21

His punning and acerbic attacks antagonize liberals (count them easily among the one-star ratings) and even many conservatives (offering three or four stars). Not that a conservative would claim that Savage has it wrong, he just goes too far, yells too loud, rambles too long, and seems less concerned about readers accepting his creed than he cares about hammering home his point. Savage is clearly conservatively correct almost all of the time and never politically correct. He's right, the liberal agenda has not only crept into our lives, it has grabbed hold of too many of our institutions and much of our entertainment and cultural heritage. The problem is that Savage is savage.<br />Savage is better-educated than most conservative talk show hosts and authors. That does not mean that he is an expert in politics. The liberal counterparts to Savage and his fellow conservative talk show hosts are relatively few and hard to categorize. And they don't sell many books. Savage reads more like Gordon Liddy, well over to the curmudgeonly side than to the compassionate end of the scale. Sean Hannity offers a more photogenic, glib analysis and less vitriol. Coulter is attractive, incisive, and does more and better if imperfect research. If all of these elements could be combined into a well-educated, experienced, attractive and more compassionate composite, I think we'd have a better talk show host, pundit and book author, not just a mealy-mouthed compromise. Savage offers one dimension for this uberhost and, sad to report, some of it is not pretty.	2003-05-21

Perhaps most compelling is the time capsule it represents, back to a simpler age for football, before advertising, television, marketing and crass commercialism took hold. The book is now thirty years old. Updated in the late 1990s Davies adds information on the team members, twenty-five years after they won their national cup. The reader can only marvel at how much things have changed in world football since this book emerged. Back then, an apprentice might earn [very]little...Even though that amount went a lot further back then, it was a pittance. Players were recruited at about age 13 from local teams. The glory, not the cash, earned their attention. Training consisted of some jogging, minimal weight training and drills in the basics. It was a pretty simple, and certainly unglamorous routine, ten months of the year. Medical care seemed primitive, some based more on superstition than science. Veterans would decry the lack of guts from some of the players, and the absence of grounding in the key, basic skills, e.g., ball trapping. But what a life it was! From the players' bios, it is clear that the alternative would have been to work the mines, unload ships, or collect garbage. Football was a joy! And even then, the players from the middle of the century would probably think those of the 1970s had it pretty soft.<br />Chapters cover several players, the manager, the early version of English hooligans, key games, a doting, almost sinister fan, and the club directors, in relatively brief, insightful and not-too-critical prose. The appendices include a study of the team's set plays and shows with statistics for the year how critical these 'dead ball' moves were to the success of the team. Brief surveys of player attitudes, life history, family, and hobbies offer a superficial profile of the club. We catch a glimpse of lives, from dads changing nappies to a manager's busy schedule, yet I felt more empty at the end than moved.<br />Tim Parks and Joe McGuinness have made more recent, intensive attempts to cover this same ground: a year with an Italian football team, up close and personal. A modern version of 'Glory game', featuring Man United (see, for instance, \\"Manchester Unlimited\\"), would offer stark contrasts, like Michael Lewis' recent book on American baseball.	2003-05-21

Linda Chavez's autobiography in effect conveys three arguments against affirmative action. First, to affirm one group requires that group to be stereotyped. Chavez shows that she is at times stereotyped as a Mexican, as a minority, and a `gabacho' (a derogative term for whites used by some of her Chicano students). She benefits from the special attention and aid she receives when she is portrayed as a minority, and offended when she is casually dismissed as a stereotype. Does it matter, for instance, that she did not speak Spanish at home? Does she still qualify as a Latino or Chicano? With a Jewish husband does she lose her right to claim her Latin heritage?<br />Second, if affirmative action results in admission to college or to employment, what happens when the person is unable to do the job? Does affirmative action guarantee selection and permanent employment? Many who benefit from affirmative action are not destined. But what about those who accept the opportunity presented by affirmative action but not the responsibility? Chavez chafes at just such students in her teaching experience at the University of Colorado. She survives a classroom revolt and death threats.<br />Third, affirmative action leaves us with questions as to who should benefit and who should pay? As the middle-class daughter of middle-class parents should she is denied aid which apparently goes to the daughter of wealthier minority parents, simply because Chavez can't speak Spanish. She suffers and other, poor taxpayers pay. Should affirmative action be directed towards income inequity or ethnic injustices?<br />This book is less a story of conversion than it is a story of assimilation. Because Chavez is the product of an Anglo mother and a Latino father, she is hard to stereotype. And as the product of a rancorous home life, she is a survivor and a striver. Fair enough to pass as an Anglo, and good-looking enough to model, she receives some of the benefits of `white privilege' while also earning the disparagement of the affirmative action `purists'.<br />More important, Chavez shows that she is a unique, multi-faceted person, difficult to stereotype. The losses in her life, especially in her family, color and explain her story more than her ethnic heritage or political affiliations. Her `conservative' views rankle liberals promoting a social agenda based on simplified, inappropriate stereotypes. The story tends to drag out at times yet real life is not always exciting or expected to read like a novel.	2003-04-20

The evidence he finds is neither surprising nor inconsistent with the original statement about the circumstances of the death as presented the Vatican. What's interesting is how he finds his evidence and how what was not said in the original inquiry led to the pursuit of a better explanation. In the process, Follain's story reads more like Robert Ludlum mystery or a Nelson DeMille travelogue, as he tracks down people, asks first innocent then probing questions, and effectively if incompletely re-constructs the story behind the deaths.<br />The Catholic Church and no less the Vatican has been severely damaged by its own secrecy and secrets. While some stories are not worth taking public, an obsession with secrecy produces more distrust than does the hard, candid side of the story. Homosexuality and Opus Dei, two sometimes tawdry secrets of the church, get an airing here, and the most saddening point is the self-illusion of secrecy the church seems intent on maintaining.<br />Follain also finds that the storied Swiss Guards are much more ceremonial window-dressing than an effective security or intelligence force. The members of this small cadre, the ones Follain contacts, most of them disillusioned or discontented, make a pretty strong case that some men join the Guards for the wrong reasons and the Guard itself seems to be used for the wrong reasons. Tradition seem more important  than a clear mission.<br />It is the misunderstanding and misapplication that lie behind the story of the three deaths. Although the conclusion is not dramatic, neither is it melodramatic. And it is candid and honest, not a Hollywood screenplay, not a sanitized version, and not what the mother of one of the victim's might want. And, in the telling, there is something worth reading.	2003-04-20

Both follow a full 38-match season of teams that are, at times, surprising and mediocre, sometimes simultaneously. Avoiding relegation to a lower division is the major impetus for both teams, not a national championship. One is coming off a miracle, the other hoping for and heading for one. And there are significant differences. Unlike Tim Parks in A season with Verona, McGinniss has direct access to the players and coach, although only brief, menacing contact with the owner. Parks acted as a fan, lived and died with the team while he stayed with his family, became very familiar with other fans, and lived a normal home life between matches. McGinniss lived alone in a cold apartment, away from his family in America; he has too much time on his hands. Parks had been a lifelong fan from Britain. McGinniss came to the game much later in life. And it shows.<br />The miracle of Castel di Sangro, a town of 5,000 hearty souls high in the mountains east of Rome, occurs before McGinniss arrives. What transpires while he is there might be better described as tragedy, without farce. There is death, drama, drugs and sex. Travel to play matches offers some glimpses of Italian life and land, but very little. He is more than a little pleased with his self-evaluation of the Castel di Sangro players, and not shy about saying so. McGinniss irritatingly inserts himself into disputes and advises the coach on players and tactics. He tries to play agent for a promising goalkeeper, but cant convince the American coach to take him. He can identify a rotten, corrupt referee like an expert. He begins to read his own worshipful (if invented) clippings from the Italian press, who marvel at the very idea of an American writer spending a year with such a minor league team.  He even seems to flirt, at the end, with the idea of earning a coachs license himself (Italian coaches need to be licensed). Yet he cant see the inevitable betrayal that closes the season.<br />McGinnissItalian improves with time, but it is not clear that his judgment or insight does. McGinniss intimacy with the players seems genuine yet there are times when the players seem to mock him or to treat him with the disbelief his assertions sometimes deserve.

The trials and tribulations of Russia, Cuba, Cambodia, and Vietnam get a second review, this time under a critical light. There are plenty of people who must now be saying to themselves: I hope no one remembers what I said about ______. Reading the discredited quotations leaves the reader sadder but wiser.    Using her thoughtful work, here is a list of ways to become a useless idiot:    1. Blame America first.  2. Extol enforced, pervasive, subsistence equality rather than progress or wealth creation.  3. Enjoy freedom but don't understand it and allow it for others.  4. Forget how wrong critics were about nuclear freezes, the benefits of communism, and the long-term success of Marxism.  5. Believe communist rhetoric, ignore communist reality.  6. Discount governments that murder its dissidents, throttle its people, and drive millions into exile.  7. Deny the value of private property and wealth, usually while having plenty of your own.  8. Make positive predictions or analyses as to the economic power and success of communist countries.  9. Holding capitalism to be standards of perfection while glossing over wholesale problems in communist countries.   10. When in doubt, hate America.    Sure, America has its problems. One of its beauties is the country's ability to accept and absorb critics and self-criticism. Bu those who see communism or socialism, here or abroad, as a better way, are just missing the picture. With all America's faults, it's the place where people seek refuge and a better life, and where both can be found.	2003-04-04

His male protagonist, almost always a reforming alcoholic, haunted by his past, trained in the ways of the Special Forces, adored by young and beautiful women, cracks jokes, stories, and hilarious thoughts at a rate of about four per page.<br />This time DeMille takes us to Vietnam, all over Vietnam. With the knowledge of a seasoned veteran of the American war there, he leads the reader through tropical jungles, beautiful beaches, romance, criminal pasts, and foreign intrigue. A surprisingly long, dense, and detailed work, \\"Up Country\\" is a sentimental journey that produces somewhat predictable yet always compelling results. A more realistic and riveting version of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt, DeMille's hero is both common and super in his ability to attract women, solve crimes, and find his way through a hostile, foreign country.	2003-04-03

Chapters begin with the psychological contract (1), theories of managing people (2), individual and organizational learning (3), individual and organizational motivation (4), ethics and values (5), personal growth and work stress (6), and later topics include managing diversity (12), leadership (13), decision making (15), performance appraisal (18), and managing change (20). The pantheon of authors features experts such as Henry Mintzberg, Jay Conger, Denise Rousseau, Ed Lawler, Peter Senge, Cary Cooper, Deborah Tannen, Geert Hofstede, Hank Sims, Victor Vroom, Jeffrey Pfeffer, Ray Miles, and Rosabeth Moss Kanter. There are numerous charts, diagrams, graphs and models. Anecdotes and examples are plentiful. Self-assessments are rare. Few of the readings offer empirical data; the emphasis is on mental models, images, and concepts.<br />Professors of organizational behavior, looking for readings rather than integrated text, exercises, and cases, as well as a less expensive alternative to traditional college textbooks, will find this book appealing. These authors are, in general, engaging and highly readable. Chapters can be assigned in an order or avoided altogether to please the teacher's preferences. The breadth of topics, the currency of the treatments, and the expertise of the authors provide a solid foundation for the primary college OB course. Graduate students in need of less text structure and faculty in need of less ancillary materials will find the most benefit.<br />The book is rooted in social psychology and emphasizes perception, learning, thinking, images and personality, e.g., interpersonal communication, attribution, creativity. There is less on the `behavior' side of organizational behavior. Several authors use the device of posing `myths' to contrast withthe author's learned, alternative state (`fact'), and sometimes the myths read more like `conventional wisdom' or the author's own attempt to make his or her point more vivid by presenting a myth that exists only in the minds of a few people. For business school students, this reader is more about organizations and people than about business. Business faculty and courses adopting this book will likely want and need to provide a management context.	2003-04-02

In her wonderful, piercing March 2003 column, she lamented the failure of Western European leaders, including the pope, to recognize and respsond to the [ill treatment] in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In April 2003, she published the words of an Iraqi POW at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. He put an Iraqi's words to the [horrible things] observed and described by Fallaci.<br />\\"The rage and the pride\\" is more indirect and problematic. Translating her own work, Fallaci at times succumbs to waves of literary inventiveness that sweep away some of the focused anger and outrage. Perhaps she has seen too much. Yet the passion, the frustration, the anger and the fury are evident. She especially despises the pope for receiving the emissary from Iraq, creating a perverse form of... equivalence between the United States and the Hussein regime.	2003-03-24

Memories of the high point of his athletic, competitive and physical fitness provide a rich tapestry without the cynicism and commercialism drowning most of college athletics today. For the many ex-jocks, especially those who peaked as young men, this is a pleasant, sentimental ride back in time. There is an almost syrupy subplot, crossing Conroy's Catholic innocence and Citadel monastic life with a beautiful, pregnant young woman that he befriends, develops a crush on, and loses in another tragic life event.<br />But some things are troubling or do not ring true. As in his other semi-autobiographical works, his sadistic father more than haunts Conroy. The author as a young man is beaten and slapped silly, almost hard for the reader to stomach and to understand of an athlete at the peak of his physical strength. Thirty years later and eighty pounds heavier Conroy seems to doubt the sincerity of his dad, now chastised by the author's characterization of him in \\"The Great Santini\\". There is also Conroy's apparent love-hate relationship with the Citadel and it is not clear that Conroy has made up his mind on this topic, despite rapprochement later in his life.<br />Then there is the losing season itself. Conroy is a bit too self-deprecating. He was an all-state athlete and despite his self-criticism during this strange season (and a coach prone to shouting, \\"Don't shoot, Conroy!\\"), he was often a prolific scorer and he was named MVP for the team. His teammates, many of them described as marvelous players, all seem to chafe and wither under the eye of a sphinx-like Coach Thompson, a man who tries to ignore or to pretend that the Citadel's time-consuming discipline of life does not exist. And the intimate details of each game, unearthed after thirty years, are too detailed to come across asdead on accurate. And boy can these boys cuss! My 1960's coaches would have benched me for just about any one of the many words these guys use to pepper their trash talk. The final irony for me was the almost inexplicable later reverence shown for Coach Thompson, a man who is portrayed throughout the season is a callous person, out of touch with his players, unable to employ their multiple talents properly, and prone to piques of fury that lead him to bench and apparently willfully destroy All-Americans in the making.<br />It is difficult to discern where the truth ends and where faded memories and fiction take over.	2003-03-24

This is a week-by-week, blow-by-blow account, up close and very personal. He starts as an interested observer and becomes a believer.<br />Better that this is written by a man of letters than by a journalist or a sportswriter, Parks at times becomes perhaps literate in studying the passion behind the football fans who seem to live and die by the fortunes of their favorites. Best of all, Parks chose a season that provided a riveting conclusion to a season of ups and downs. Sadly, a quick look at Italy's Serie A standings in early 2003 finds Hellas mired in mid-level Serie B.<br />Hellas fans are, at times, boisterous, irreverent, profane, vulgar, and, among the hard core, loyal to a fist fight and to a fault. Seeing them week by week, after a crazed introduction on the first, mind numbing rod trip to the south, Parks offers the insight of an Englishman not unfamiliar with football hooligans but also willing to try to understand the mind and life of the devoted Hellas fan.<br />Enjoy the passion.	2003-03-09

In November 1942, war in Europe was not an American experience and D-Day in France remained eighteen months away. The American army was untested against the Germans. Atkinson provides a rich, colorful - his use of the language and the local flora add a dimension that goes well beyond historic reporting - story of an army defining itself in battle. He is a lively writer, not a dry historian. He offers deep, personal glimpses, snippets of conversations, excerpts of letter home. And he teaches the reader.<br />Africa became a school for the Americans. Through a careful recount of the battle, from the November landings to the May triumph in Tunis, Atkinson shows that there were painful lessons to be learned:<BR>1. The American army had been through lean years prior to the war. Few in numbers, ill equipped, poorly trained, the first U.S. forces to fight the Germans came mentally unprepared and, too often, naïve and overconfident.<BR>2. American military leaders, like its foot soldiers, often lacked experience, savvy and the leaders lacked the killer instinct needed to drive their own forces and to accept the inevitable losses that come in the horrors of war. Decisions that led to the death of men haunt any commander; delaying decisions may lead to even more deaths. Leadership started with credibility and some senior officers simply lacked it.<BR>3. Logistics can win or lose a battle: trucks, railways, ports, shipping.<BR>4. The Americans had to learn to work with skeptical Brits and to hate the Germans. Neither task was easy. Thousands of American soldiers died in making the point.<BR>5. Massive American resources and numbers were not going to be enough to overcome German military skill and tenacity.<BR>6. German tank technology and infantry tactics could resist American numerical superiority for a long battle.<BR>7. Terrain and rain matter.<br />For six months, the American army went to war and to school. Timidity and ill-formed strategies extracted a high price. Without these lessons learned, the victories that followed the campaign in Tunisia would have been even more expensive if a reality at all. \\"Army at dawn\\" is an excellent history of a historically less visible theater of the war.<br />With more than one hundred pages of endnotes, data are abundant. There are many very good maps, although some direct map links to the text, perhaps some numbered sequences, detailed captions for the maps would have provided more clarity, more than Attaching dates to the rapid, complex movement of forces is helpful but hard to parse at times.	2003-02-24

I was intrigued enough to buy the book but then I was disappointed. Liddy comes across too much like the testosterone-loaded, old-fashioned curmudgeon than an enlightened conservative.  He overstates his premise, back &quot;when I was a kid&quot;. His views on women are most troubling, even to other conservatives. Some of what he writes makes sense. There are many basic, 'American' values worthy of attention and possible restoration. In fact, there is much with which any basic conservative, even centrist could agree. But Liddy barks and sometimes bites, when he could be charming and convincing. I apprecate his knowledge, education and experience. I can even appreciate his sense of loyalty, duty and honor -- in or out of jail. But, for me, this book needed a greater sense of perspective.	2003-02-07

The result is a book I found hard to put down. While this is not great literature, new ground, or extensive character development, 'Flight' kept me wanting to know how our heroes were going to pull this off, who would make it through to the end, and how, once again, Nazis would err or suffer. Imaginative if somewhat predictable, but the latter is characteristic of just about any book about World War II -- we know how it's going to end. We even know many of the intermediate steps. It's the ride, not the destination, that is the most fun.<br />Detailed descriptions of Denmark in a time of war, of Copenhagen,  slow trains, a steam-powered motorcycle, small islands and fishing villages, and of the pivotal Hornet are what make this book work. Harald, our geeky physics student, and Karen, the striking, leggy, Jewish heroine, make for an odd but interesting coupling. While not great characters, Follett makes you like and, hopefuly, understand them.	2003-02-07

He provides intricate background and small facts. Yet the characters are much too stereotyped and Forsyth telegraphs the all-too-expected outcome from the first story. While you might learn about British 'paras', the German strategy in northern Italy in 1944, the small details of piloting a British Airways flight from Bangkok to London, and the arrogance and bad habits of aristocrats cheating the art world, there is no one with much appeal to this reader.<br />The fifth story, longer and different, opens another genre. \\"Whispering wind\\" is as much science fiction as meticulous history. Forsyth certainly did a lot of travel and study of the geography of Wyoming. But the story dragged on. The characters were icons or caricatures rather than heroes or villains. There's the perfect outdoorsman, the perfect Indian maiden, the perfect professor, the perfect mountain sheriff, and the perfect idiot among Custer's troops who resurfaces several generations later in this strange time travel tale. All too perfect, too predictable.<br />Forsyth has done much better.	2003-01-02

Sernovitz might be capturing the tedium of the research analyst, the conflicts of interest, the give-and-take between the analysts and the investment bankers, the inability of journalists to empathize or to comprehend financial markets (maybe they're just mad that they make so little and our hero makes so much), but most of all I found a boring, self-absorbed character, trying his best to play Bud Fox (of \\"Wall Street\\") so he can retire from a job he hates and that clearly troubles him (only enough to have pangs of conscience; not to really do anything about it). This Faustian bargain doesn't offer our protagonist or the reader much other than oppressive work hours, a prohibitively expensive and insane life outside of work (if you can call it a life), a utilitarian relationship with his girlfriend, and a series of flashbacks, reflections and long-winded literary passages. Sernovitz can write but it didn't work for me.<br />I find the daily front page of the Wall Street Journal much more interesting. In the future, I will have to read their reviews with more skepticism. If this is how markets work, maybe we should all sleep in a little later and pay a whole lot less attention.	2003-01-02

Not surprisingly, a lot of what is known about him is equally vague, subject to revision or argument. Yet the story is worth telling and well worth reading. There is much to be learned. Coughlin cites ancient conflicts, e.g., Persian versus Arabic differences, and shows how Western addiction to and Arab control over oil created the rise of the region as strategic resource. Before that time, there was not much of interest in the region, other than to colonial powers.     Given the reticence of those most knowledgeable of Hussein to speak freely (if they care to live), the absence of good records, and the flattering propaganda produced by his government, writing this book must have been difficult. Few sources on Saddam can be judged to be authoritative. There are very strong biases on each side. The author attempts to introduce and judge competing, even equally unreliable reports of the same event. He does not engage in excessive speculation.    Hussein rose from a feudal, tribal society, where progress, loyalty and consolidating tribal power led to what we'd call inbreeding if not incest, with the marriage of close relatives and sometimes questionable paternity (including Saddam's). He is often labeled a thug; he is ruthless, unforgiving, not well educated early in his life, and sensitive to social class envy. He is a staunch anti-communist who allied himself with the Russians and murdered communist party officers while openly admiring Stalin and running a totalitarian dictatorship. He takes offense easily; he applies punishment quickly.    Foreign powers can be called on account for the instability and a revenge on the West factor in the Arab world. There's the British failures to honor promises to Arabs following World War I, the French government happy to sell Arabs (and Israelis) nuclear power plants and fighter planes, and the German's willing to help Saddam develop nerve gas. Many western countries wanted to recycle the petrodollars they paid for newly expensive oil. Hussein's nationalization of Iraqi oil paid for his rise, increasing state revenues led to a spending spree in early 1980s on weapons, infrastructure, and programs for people. With this, he won the respect and admiration of his people while also engendering fear and domestic terror.    As a military leader he has been a general if not abysmal failure. He miscalculated Iran's staying power under Khomeni. A disastrous war followed. And after Teheran hostage taking, where my enemy's enemy is my friend, Saddam earned American approval and support, including CIA. There is some speculation that CIA started supporting him well before he came to power.    The book offers a good understanding of the region and a reasonably complete understanding of Hussein. For those seeking a justification for or even an understanding of the American stance towards Iraq, more needs to be learned and known. This is a great start towards that public education.	2002-11-13

There are plenty of books with 'leadership' in the title and as many definitions of leadership as there are authors writing about leadership. This book will be a big help to the professor looking for an integrative solution for the classroom.<br />Manning and Curtis do a wonderful job for the teacher looking for a comprehensive, engaging tool for teaching students about the 'art' of leadership. In the process, Manning and Curtis offer a variety of interesting and involving exercises, essays, examples, and ideas about the practice and profession of leadership.  Over sixty people assisted in the review process to develop the book.<br />Manning is a psychology professor and Curtis is a professor and coordinator of leadership and organizational studies, both at Northern Kentucky University.<br />This is a 368-page workbook, with more than thirty exercises designed to illustrate various aspects of leadership. The book is divided into nine parts and 28 chapters, including parts on vision, ethics, empowerment and performance management, among others. Leaders are portrayed as teachers, heroes and rulers.

Some Allied officers and politicians feared the creation of a Jewish brigade; the Allies knew that there would be more than a late contribution to the Allied war effort from these highly motvated soldiers. And the year following victory in the European theater of war showed just how well-organized, focused, and effective a small number of well-trained and committed soldiers could be. They rooted out Nazi murderers, stole weapons from right under the noses of the Allies, and organized the exodus of Jewish war victims.<br />Blum uses a variety of military, historical and personal sources to construct his tale. By the time the reader reaches the end notes, Blum's choice of the three featured heroes makes good sense, among all of the heroics that made up this brigade. Of course, the memories of the people he interviewed were imperfect and incomplete, fifty years following the events. It should make a good movie. Perhaps that explains why the chapters have more of an outline format than the details some would like to see. And the first few chapters take some time to get the story up and running.<br />Leah Pinchuk has the most remarkable story of survival among the four. Her story epitomizes the terror of the war, the horrors of the Holocaust, and the ultimate triumph of human nature.<br />A strong historical and personal record worth reading.	2002-09-03

While that might make the entire biography sugary and sentimental, it in fact makes for a tribute to a man maligned in his time for his \\"faults\\", who actually lived up to his promises and literally made the world safer for democracy.<br />Reagan was the son of an alcoholic father and a quiet mother. The family moved a lot. It took him years to realize he needed glasses just to see the world. He talked his way into a college football scholarship at a time when few people finished high school and only a fraction of them went on to college. He missed a \\"big\\" job at Montgomery Ward and landed with an even better one as a broadcaster.<br />Using his baseball broadcast connection, he traveled to spring training in California and quickly landed a studio contract as the \\"next Robert Taylor\\". By then, much of his character had already been formed. His concern for others, for equality (before \\"civial rights\\" was much of a term), and, most importantly, his staunch stand against communism, led him to the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild. And all this time he thought -- we thought -- he was a liberal.<br />Marrying, divorcing, struggling, working for General Electric, he made his political mark speaking for Goldwater in 1964. Almost retired from his film career, he was pulled into politics. Quickly, surprisingly and easily elected governor of California, he eventually became the alternative to America's slide towards mediocrity, the antidote to detente and to Carter's well-intentioned but spineless policies. The rest, they say, is history.<br />Reagan was a man of ideas and ideals, including a basic belief in God, in fairness, and in the old-fashioned American way. Laughed at by liberals, he won his elections, produced the demise of the Soviet Union, built the basis for amazing economic growth, and earned recognition from all the people in later years. They ranked him America's best president, ahead of Kennedy and Lincoln. He was an executive, not a legislator, and a tough negotiator, not a compromiser. Having avoided national politics for the first fifty years of his life, he had not sold out his personal or political beliefs to the party.<br />No glad hander. No professional politician, Reagan found good people to work for him and, other than for the Contragate mess, used delegation effectively. Decribed by pundits as a dunce, a simpleton, and a doddering, senile old man, he proved them all wrong with his persistent attention to the big details, to values and to demonstrating his character rather than by pandering to the people or claiming to be \\"working as hard as I can\\" (results, not efforts, matter most).<br />Noonan writes with verve and admiration. She truly loves the man. Nancy Reagan's public personna as a cold, domineering wife is carefully reviewed and revised. This is not a voluminous, definitive biography. Of greatest value is its role in painting a man of principle who protected millions of people by his bold, stubborn, consistent policies delivered before a highly sceptical mainstream media. As a conservative, he had to make and use a very powerful government to return more power to the people, rather than centralize it in an all-powerful Washngton. This is a fine line to walk and he did it successfully.	2002-07-30

Its what you know that just ain't so that will hurt you.\\" Or words to that effect. Like Ben Wattenberg's earlier book (whose title I used for this review), Myths of Rich and Poor explains that much of what you have been led to believe about wealth and poverty is simply incorrect.<br />The authors drill down into census data, the basic \\"facts\\" of American life, to show that we are not getting poorer. Our homes are bigger, food is cheaper, gas is less expensive, many 'poor' people enjoy home and car ownership, air conditioning, cable television, and an entire collection of things that most truly poor people would never even dream they could own.<br />Like David Landes' Wealth and Poverty of Nations and the best-selling Millionaire Next Door, this book does a better job of really reading and analyzing what is right -- and wrong -- about the American market economy.<br />All of these books show that finishing high school, staying married, and getting a job are th best poverty prevention strategies available and that the American market facilitates these things better than any other system. There are no guarantees and much of it is up to the individual. You just have to have the desire, direction and discipline to win your share of  the American dream.	2002-07-28

Booms and depressions, clever inventions and failed plans, tough competitors and grandoise government schemes all receive their due.<br />There is the story of King Cotton and how the gin made it profitable. Gordon reports on the California Gold Rush, the first television syndication (that's how Desi Arnaz earns a cover picture on an economic history book), war economies, the decision to build the World Trade towers (an eerie story to read today), steamboat races, railroad competition and more, each in pithy, five-page synopses of major historic studies or records. Brief as they are, there is not always a full story, but the histories leave the read impressed and engaged.<br />Gordon highlights well-known phrases, e.g., \\"The business of America is business,\\" \\"The public be damned!\\" and explains how they came about (and the myths around same). Before we spoke of people \\"going postal\\", Gordon writes about the now-lapsed term, \\"postalization\\", another idea entirely.<br />In \\"The American Game\\" he shows how baseball is unique in that it was a business and not just a sport from its early years. A strange business, yes, where today \\"semiserfdom\\" of ballplayers has produced average annual salaries of $2.38 million and an industry prone to \\"work stoppages\\" and seemingly on the brink of disaster.<br />The better stories are of the visionaries who made and managed business in America, including the man who spent his personal fortune to make milk safe to drink for millions and the unsung heroes who saved businesses from failure. This is a good education for those who don't understand or who doubt the power of free markets, an idea whose time has come, or simply the American dream as it has been lived.	2002-07-15

Spencerville, The General's Daughter, and even Plum Island come to mind. The more books he writes, the darker he becomes, it seems.<br />I have been a fan since Charm School. I worked my way through Gold Coast, Cathedral, Rivers of Babylon and even Mayday, one of his earlier, co-authored, often overlooked books. Mayday shows the signs of his greatness.<br />DeMille works best for me when he maximizes the humor (often irony) and tension while minimizing graphic viloence or the dark side of human nature. Often his villains are driven but not inherently evil. His heroes are always flawed and usually funny in the worst situations.<br />Word of Honor balances all of these features and the result is one of DeMille's best, if not THE best. Vietnam has been cathartic for many Americans. Unlike World War II, where good and evil seem clear (and the basis for more heroic fiction than any other event in the world), Vietnam is nuances and conflicted lives. DeMille uses these to fine tune his humor and his hero.<br />This one is well worth checking out.	2002-07-15

Matthews, a charming and engaging man, hosts a good show. \\"Really think\\", however, is less than two hundred pages (in a tiny book, about 275 words per page) of vignettes about people and their lives followed by Matthews' customary, \\"Now, let me tell you what I really think.\\"<br />He uses lines from popular movies, like \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch\\". He remembers where he was when JFK and RFK were shot. He shows that he is a real boomer. He adopts his father's Republican admiration of Eisenhower, becomes enthralled by JFK's Catholicism and magnetic personality, dips his toe in the Goldwater pool (along with Hillary Clinton, he explains), joins the Peace Corps, comes back to Washington and eventually becomes an assistant to liberal congressman (capped off with Tip O'Neill), all before he launches his media career. I'm not sure that this makes him the \\"journalist\\" he describes himself to be, more likely he relishes the role of \\"entertainment\\", a charge he gladly accepts.<br />His thoughts on family, on knocking on doors (to get a seat at the table), and Jesuit education are most interesting and saved for last. But I was disappointed. After about two hours of reading, \\"Really think\\" ended and came up short.	2002-07-11

There is some small irony in noting that, according to Amazon, people who purchased this book also purchased Kenneth Timmerman's expose of Jesse Jackson, \\"Shakedown\\". Authors of both books present a very critical view of thoroughly complex and conflicted leaders of American \\"culture\\". The comparions are worth noting. There are lessons to be learned.<br />Both subjects are well-established, nationally (for Jackson, internationally) recognized brand names. Both started out small, but not nearly as small as their publicists might want you to believe. Both Stewart and Jackson had a lot of help along the way and few of their supporters received the recognition they deserve, for better or for worse. Both Stewart and Jackson like to have others foot the bill and, most recently, both have found corporate America to be the best source of support for their projects.<br />While Stewart is the leader of the American languid lifestyle movement and Jackson is the self-appointed leader of the diversity movement in America, both seem to be more interested in their own betterment than in the people they purport to serve. Both have become very wealthy along the way, while posing as modest, hardworking, high-concern-for-other types.<br />In Stewart's case, she earns either admiration or contempt from large portions of the population but, then again, we could say the same for Jackson. Byron's Stewart comes across as a cold, bipolar woman who adopted the style of her alcoholic, mean-spirited father. She orders and instructs rather than asks. She seems indifferent to her daughter. She thought she married into wealth and instead, found that her own pursuit of wealth destroyed her shaky marriage. <br />Successful people often pay a high price for their accomplishments. Some go ahead knowingly and make a deal with the devil and cause others to pay the price as well. Less successful people envy those who succeed. Armchair critics carp. Minor flaws become magnified and the really busy, successful people can't spend all their time refuting false claims about themselves. Exposes always have their critics, especially from those who admire the subjects. The authors of both these books must have had a hard time getting all their facts straight (and I assume most of the \\"facts\\" are correct) and, in the end, we see seriously flawed leaders. Both books offer us some insight into the \\"dark side\\" of leadership. And you can't help but feel sorry for the subjects and even for their followers and, in some small way, for their biographers who felt they needed to dredge up some of the muck.<br />Byron did a lot of digging and the story is engrossing if not riveting at moments.	2002-07-07

A once-noble calling -- working to gain and to protect the civil rights of all people -- has descended to a recurring, tawdry scheme of black- and greenmail. Timmerman catalogs with almost mind-numbing detail the faults, frauds and fancies of a man many of us had been raised to respect. Former friends of Jackson and the public record provide a solid base of evidence for Timmerman's expose.<br />From Jackson's April 1968 moment holding the dying Martin Luther King (Oops! That wasn't really true), to his early calling to the ministry (and departure almost immediately thereafter, well short of his degree), to his moral character (Oops, wrong again; that is, unless you follow the Bill Clinton model), it becomes obvious that Jesse Jackson has made a great living for himself and his family and friends out of \\"helping others\\".<br />This is a sad, complex, well-documented, painful tale. The real villians, beyond the gang members and Jackson's other convicted friends, are the media, political and corporate elite who have fallen for and furthered Jackson's self-interests. Only T. J. Rodgers seems willing to stand up to Jackson's polite if unguarded threats. The victims are those who really need help and who trust(ed) Jackson. And many stockholders and much of the American public.<br />When people confuse wealth and income, this is a good case of how the two differ. Jackson has wealth but never seems to have much of an income. For a man who claims little income and modest needs, he has accumulated for himself and his family wealth most people would associate with years of honest labor or creative genius. Jackson has found a way to obtain that wealth with a new definition of \\"genius\\".	2002-07-07

Most likely it was here, not at Normandy, where the tides of war turned on the Germans. The Germans pushed too far, Hitler staked victory to his ego, and they found themselves surrounded and cut off. The Russians were willing to pay a horrible price to gain the upper hand in the dead of winter.<br />Beevor has done an admirable job of research. To start, the language and culture of the opposing forces are foreign in every respect. And then there is the matter of fair, objective, reliable data: Given what happened here, there is no such thing as an objective view or a fair telling of the story, at least not one that will satisfy all readers. Allegiances are muddied. Allies of the Germans and Russians change sides during the battle, some more than once. Death soon becomes a welcome escape. The unraveling of humanity is unrelenting. Beevor is not squeamish or graphic. To me he has no favorites. Few candidates surface. A German priest who is also a doctor and an artist, who dies later in prison camp, is one of mine.<br />The capacity of the Germans to march to Hitler's tune is matched only by the ruthless, unforgiving Russian system. Advance or be shot by your own men. Say a bad word about the party -- and you're asking for a quick bullet to the head. Allow some of your men to surrender, and your fate may be sealed.<br />It  is impossible to find a happy story here. Simple men and well-trained officers found themselves in unspeakable cold, hunger and filfth, trying to make some sense of life amidst such madness. But it is a story worth reading and remembering, if only to be thankful that you were not there. This was no \\"Band of Brothers\\", at least not as most Americans would view it.<br />If you prefer the video form, the recent film, \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is a very good, if fictionalized treatment of a small part of this battle, the stand off between snipers from both sides. It shows the perilous river crossings, the brutal discipline.	2002-07-05

A North Carolina history buff, well-versed in local Civil War details, stands accused of offering a racist course at a community college.<br />Along the way, Bledsoe surfaces these problems, most of them well-known to the public yet blind spots to mainstream journalists:<br />1. Assignment of stories is not based on an objective pursuit of the news. Rather, they reveal the well-documented liberal biases and desire to sensationalize from even the hometown or 'local' paper.<BR>2. Many journalists want to write something that gets them attention from their peers. There is more ego and entertainment than education or integrity in such people.<BR>3. \\"Quotes\\" in articles are not always the real words of the person to whom they are attributed. And paraphrases are even worse.<BR>4. Once a story is printed, it takes on a life of its own, often picked up uncritically by other media outlets. This multiplies the injury.<BR>5. The truth is no defense against a reckless, opinionated journalist.<br />After the death of the instructor, with a case of libel in the works, there was little reason to show the videotapes of the class to the public. Perhaps that would have helped. But it is not an obligation of the person who organized the class.<br />Apply this same lens to works like Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and dimed\\" and it becomes apparent why surveys show that Americans distrust journalists and why good people avoid speaking to them. In fact, there comes a time when the word \\"journalist\\" takes on a life of its own, far away from the profession. Sure, there are many hardworking, honest, journalists with integrity but as Harold MacMillan once said, the purpose of an education is to help you detect when a man is \\"speaking rot\\". Bledsoe found the rot.	2002-07-04

There is a significant pleasure in the reading experience itself as he relates two months in the life of seven-year old Luke Chandler in September and October 1952 in Black Oak, Arkansas. Having spent some time in Arkansas myself, the story rings true.<br />The story has elements of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". But there was more. There's a bully, an outcast, a beautiful teen-age girl, a gruff Pappy, an uncle fighting in Korea, a mother longing to get off the farm, and a heroic, stoic dad. In two months, young Luke witnesses two murders, a birth, tornadoes, and flood.<br />Grisham details the life of the working poor, an impoverished farm family who, by the grace of God and their hard work, keep their heads just above the even more destitute around them. Cotton farming in the Mississippi Delta was a daunting task, and Grisham's story of the hired hands, the harvest, the early start to the day, the oppressive heat, the aches of the work, a ball game on the radio at the end of a hard day, the Saturday market, and the Sunday church service is as interesting as many of the characters themselves, some drawn in simple stereotype.	2002-07-01

D'Souza does a good job of highlighting America's strengths, explaining why actually very few people hate the United States. Instead, these people want to be part of the United States. Noah Chomsky, anonymous \\"one star\\" reviewers and the \\"blame America first\\" crowd aside, America remains the literal and figurative beacon for immigrants looking for a better life, for freedom, and something to believe in. And they continue to come our way.<br />Using the September 11 events to introduce the topic, D'Souza points out what many astute observers of the events of the last year have noted. Among them: America did not invent slavery; along with the West, we abolished it.  Islam and the Judeo-Christian West have been at odds for some time. And there are good reasons for this. \\"Tolerance\\" can only be practiced or even operationally defined in a country as tolerant as the United States; many of our enemies are not only intolerant of us, they are intolerant of the expressions of their own people. And the critics of the United States often live in the United States, where they can get away wth being a critic.<br />Many of our problems in America stem from being too tolerant, too willing to accept anything and everything. Multiculturalists abhor the once-valued American melting pot. They believe that all philosophies have merit. As Thomas Sowell clearly pointed out in his works on culture and conflict, many of these other cultures are savage and self-destructive. Or read Richard Pipes' \\"Communism\\" for a pithy analysis of the twentieth century's failed alternative.<br />America and the values of political and economic freedom and produced more goods and services and freed or defended more people than we can count. Countries and cultures export our goods and ideas not because we invaded the country with soldiers but because the people want what we have and produce. And even the September 11 terrorists indulged themselves fully of the decadent West they decried.<br />Some of D'Souzas personal examples and observed anecdotes read as oversimplified or clever and did not ring fully true to me. Nonetheless, he makes his points.	2002-06-30

Having made several visits to Russia and Chile in the past ten years, this book helped explain for me some of the history and mystery of both countries. Students should read this brief (160 pages) volume. You will better understand the marvels of capitalism by understanding the absurdity of communism.<br />Communism is based on the abolition of private property and all the Marxist theory, &quot;science&quot; and predictions have seriously missed the mark, misfired, or, sadly, made life miserable for millions of people. While Lenin wanted to control the &quot;commanding heights&quot;, Daniel Yegin's recent book and PBS series of the same name shows that free markets and &quot;liberal&quot; democracy have triumphed repeatedly over the past century. Private property is not the cause of poverty. It may be the cure for poverty. People, by nature, want to acquire and own things and people, just like corporate capitalists, want to make a profit (earn more than they spend). Communism turns this simple notion on its head, and several tens of millions of deaths later, this sad phase of history is disappearing.<br />Yes, capitalism is imperfect. But what works better, communism or capitalism? Just ask the people who have lived under both political systems and the answer is obvious.<br />To quote Pipes: &quot;Communism was not a good idea that went wrong; it was a bad idea.&quot;	2002-06-27

But it might die, in fact there is a good chance that it will die, from within, through high birth rates in poor countries, and through the West's own freedom and excesses. Data, including projections, make the point pretty clear. By being tolerant, generally welcoming of newcomers (those who say we aren't welcoming haven't looked at history, other cultures, or the data), and concerned about individual freedoms, the West is made susceptible to those who like the wealth of the West but who reject its basic values. The irony is that Western values built this wealth.<br />While western countries see their birth rates decline as their politcal and economic freedoms and fruits increase, less developed, \\"non-western\\" countries and cultures have surged, primarily through their much higher birth and survival rates made possible and supported by western medicine, health care, preventive measures, and technology. With almost 1.5 billion Chinese, a billion people in India, and hundreds of millions in Indonesia, the West is most likely simply to be overrun by people leaving these poor countries and making their way to the West.<br />Unlike what some of the criticisms of \\"nativism\\" in the past, this new movement does not bring people who adopt the ways of the West. There is no melting pot. Rather, there is multiculturalism. So western culture dies out by simple attrition. The West has something important to defend. And it's not that the westerners are xenophobic or racist as much as they are committed to maintaining western values and virtues of liberty, freedom, personal initiative and rsponsibility, thrift, family, and protective laws and minimal governments.<br />Buchanan makes his point by attacking political correctness and those who decry or belittle \\"traditional\\" values. That gives the book a shrill, even nasty tone. But his points merit consideration. We ignore them at our peril.	2002-06-16

This is one of the best. The coverage is thorough if at times tedious. Cassidy makes an excellent case that the lack of a business model and the prevalent \\"greater fool\\" theory led to the demise of the Internet bubble. Too many pitched the idea that if their site captured just one percent of a [Hundred] billion-dollar market, than the firm would be a success. Only even one percent was a pipe dream, and perhaps a dozen firms had the same idea. And the \\"greater fool\\" theory suggests that even if the originators are wrong, somebody else will be foolish enough to buy them out.<br />Cassidy concludes his good work with a lengthy table of dot.com failures, a sobering story in itself. Perhaps it is so sobering that the life and exhuberance of the subject drained away. I found the last third of the book to be more of a continuous litany of mistakes and I lost much of my interest.	2002-06-12

Given it's content, the title should be: \\"What's wrong with the history department?\\" Karabell cites history faculty stories without ever noticing that his scope is so limited that he misses his entire point. There is a lot more to college than the humanities or history. They're critical but not the whole story. He is dismissive of any other discipline, especially \\"applied\\" disciplines, but reading this book you'd never know that colleges teach chemistry, biology, or any topic outside the humanities.<br />According to Karabell, any criticism of the way history faculty operate comes from the mouths of conservatives. He finds many of the history professors he cites to be left-leaning, lesbian or activist, but he dare not call them liberal, Marxist or communist. The concept of political correctness needs his attention. He can't recognize that the out-of-touch left are part of the problem or, as Pogo said: \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\"<br />Karabell is blind to the problem of the selfish overproduction of doctorates in history, so blind to accept a dismissive note from one of those complacent, tenured types who claims that employement for the graduates of his program is not his concern. The same departments who whine about poor job prospects are the ones who produce needless graduates. And asking a specialist to teach a survey course -- what an insult!<br />College is meant to prepare students for life. To suggest that an education in history is sufficient is just plain wrong. A college education includes the life of the mind as well as the life of work. Understanding history but not understanding economics, markets and the \\"theory of life\\" is a formula for failure. A good college educates students who become self-perpetuating learning systems and good, informed, engaged citizens. A liberal arts education includes the study of economics, the sciences, and psychology, among other subjects, and not just history.	2002-06-07

Sowell documents the case of how geography (harbors, arable land, navigable rivers, freedom from monsoons and tropical disease) and ideas (fundamental beliefs and principles widely shared or disseminated) combine to make the world what it is today.<br />&quot;Culture&quot; triumphs if it is sustainable and based on a credible concept that can be embraced by others. Other &quot;cultures&quot; fail or disappear when they are conquered by more dominant cultures or collapse from within due to a fundamental weakness or failure to transmit the culture across people and generations.<br />Much like David Landes' &quot;Wealth and poverty of nations&quot;, Sowell shows that societies or cultures that can produce things of value, that educate their young, that innovate, and that encourage personal freedom, initiative, private ownership and advancement based on merit, these cultures are more likely to survive.<br />Sowell dispels myths about racism, diversity and the equality of all cultures.

Faulks engages in poetic descriptions of feelings, cities, and settings, but leaves the reader without a good reason to like any of the three protagonists. Faulks also tempts the reader with a promising story line involving the Kennedy-Nixon campaign and Cold War tensions, but he leaves it all in the background. History is wasted. There is even a curious chronological slight, as Faulks places Frank fighting in Guadacanal in 1942 and then being shipped to France in 1945.<br />The ending is excessively melodramatic and any well-traveled news reporter would have allowed for a possible delay in an overseas flight, instead of giving up so easily and taking it out on the roof of  a taxi. If a taxi roof had been nearby when I finished reading, I think I'd have taken out a few frustrations myself. Faulks offered enough to keep me rading but not enough to satisfy me in the end, to recommend this to another reader, or to pick up another of his books.	2002-06-05

He does a wonderful job of conveying the shallow man who becomes engaged by a struggling boy.

And launch any of these scenarios with an end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it event, only without the music from REM.<br />A cruise ship of esteemed engineers survives a Christmas Day comet that lands off America's Northwest coast and pulverizes, burns or floods almost the entire globe, leaving only a tiny safe zone off the east coast of South Africa. The climate for survival here is ideal, given the abundance of natural resources. Too bad the ship sinks, no surprise given that the charts are worthless after this world-rearranging event. After a brief introduction to the disaster, the book covers the first year of progress in this new world.<br />Florman knows his technical details. The driving point of the book is the idea that after the world having been subjected to the equivalent of &quot;being bombed back to the Stone Age&quot;, how would life recover if the survisors were technical geniuses? Would the last two thousand years of the world's technical progress be replicated in a much shorter time frame, since we already know all the answers, we just don't have the tools, people or resources to be there?<br />But the people are boring and as colorless as the sterotypical engineers Florman apparently wants to humanize. Even the &quot;artsy&quot; few, like the dance instructor from the cruise, are cardboard characters. Florman attempts to inject drama with a multicultural pirate leader attempting to pillage the island. The dramatic effort fails just as the pillaging attempt does.<br />This might make a manual for post-Apocalyptic survival kit, if this is it, we're in for a long, tedious repopulation of the planet.	2002-03-27

The further we have moved from day games in the World Series, green grass to play, spring training where players actually had to work to get back into shape, and games a working class dad and his son could afford, the further removed I feel from baseball.<br />Buckley caught my attention with his title and tribute to  baseball's sixteen perfect games, perhaps the most difficult of all athletic achievements. He offers a chapter on each perfect game, from J. Lee Richmond's on 12 June 1880 to David Cone's 18 July 1999. Senator Jim Bunning, who earned his own chapter with a perfect game in 1964, wrote the introduction. Buckley adds an appendix of \\"nearly perfect\\" games.<br />Given the title and topic, I expected riveting, rich, deep color and drama. While a lot of respect and research went into the book, I did not find all that I sought. Worse, in covering Don Larsen's 1956 World Series perfect game, Buckley TWICE has Gil Hodges batting for the Yankees (pp. 78, 79).<br />This book should suit the needs of the fanatic who lives and breathes baseball and who can accept less-than-stellar writing.	2002-03-24

This is the story of genius, sweat, and emotion that went into the construction of the dome of Il Duomo, Florence's most visible landmark. If you've been to Florence, you will especially enjoy this history of the construction of and the creative genius behind the building of one of the architectural triumphs of the world. King brings the reader back to the time of its construction, with vivid details of the design, the political intrigue over the commissioning of the design, the technical skills of then artisans, and the lifestyles of the common workers. Using primitive raw materials and more artistry than science, Brunelleschi demonstrated a capacity to improvise, adapt, and break through old methods to solve an almost impossible physical challenge.<br />If you've not been to Florence, reading &quot;Dome&quot; might just convince you that it is time to go and well worth the visit.	2002-02-14

O'Rourke can inject more humorous insight into some of the dullest subjects than anybody else writing today. His caustic wit and blend of skeptical conservatism, often well-oiled with gin and always with a healthy irreverance for do gooders, allows him to pack a good quip into almost every sentence. He takes the mundane, the politically correct, and the traditional and stands all of them on their respective heads.<br />His take on child rearing books as a good description of management training is spot on. His hard knocks on both Gore and Bush during the campaign are much more illuminating than what we get from the mainstream press. His acerbic review of Hillary Clinton's &quot;It takes a village&quot; finally puts that ill-conceived book and concept to rest. His general maturation from a young, hip conservative to a middle-aged one might make some old fans and current skeptics wince, but he has not mellowed with age.<br />Yes, you have to have a certain sense of irony or cynicism to enjoy O'Rourke. For those who do, it is a fun read.	2002-02-14

O'Rourke's take on why we get the government we deserve, and what we get in return is sharply insightful and so very funny that readers can forget (at least for a moment) to be sad because the joke is on us.<br />His budget proposal, from his cuts on bloated agencies to his final cut, the &quot;circumcision&quot; one, is both hilarious and a good, hard look at the way the American federal government throws money around and, often, away.<br />But it's not their fault, O'Rourke wryly observes. We ask them to do this TO us in the name of doing things FOR us. Or, perhaps, do it to the other guy so they can do something for me. The best idea might simply be to take some of the money off the table and not let them have so much to spend or waste.<br />Conservatives will love O'Rourke's condemnations and even the most liberal will have to concede many of his points. He's like Peggy Noonan on acid and, for all we know, he just might be. O'Rourke knows how to live on the wild, not just to comment on the other side.	2002-02-09

As a front-line, engaged player, Carton not only had a good view, he has a good mind for knowing and seeing what went wrong. He's working on his doctorate and he should be a great professor of this genre.<br />This is an interesting companion to David Kuo's book. With a very similar title, Kuo is funnier and more dramatic, primarily because valueamerica.com was such a huge, single implosion and Kuo, by training, is a writer and, to some degree, a spin doctor. More serious and critical, Carton pulls no punches, examines a lot more companies, and has a more technical, well-grounded understanding the business models (or lack thereof) that created and destroyed the late 1990's version of the new economy. Start with \\"the greater fool\\" theory. Carton's book is better for the serious student wanting to see the big business picture.<br />Carton is methodical and crisp, even dry at times. The graphics of the book, including the font and page layout, could also have been more appealing or reader-friendly. If you're teaching an e-commerce course, as I have, you want to consider Dot.Bomb.	2002-02-09

'Valhalla' is no exception.<br />As we've seen a dozen time s before, Dirk Pitt is ruggedly handsome, chivalrous, and always one step ahead of a diabolical villain. His friends are brilliant, understanding and well-connected. Every woman he meets is physically stunning (violet eyes, red hair, great figure) and, even in his greying years, find Pitt's looks and politically incorrect behavior undeniable. But there is rarely much sex and, in this case, none at all.<br />In this latest testosterone-filled fantasy, a futuristic cruise ship mysteriously burns and sinks. By no surprise at all to the veteran Cussler reader, Pitt and friends are close by, fast to the rescue, and recognized as heroes. But the intrigue is to be more about oil than ships. And there is an even more incredible, ancient connection to Viking ships and warriors, sitting just outside New York City. Pitt embraces his considerable network and fortune to woo the women and overpower the villains, giving new, if only imagined, hope to men past their prime.<br />I read this on a recent trip to Florida and the time flew by, with one incredible feat of derring do after another. Suspend all claims on credibility and enjoy the time separated from reality. But check it out from the library or at least wait for the paperback. You probably won't keep it in your library and you might feel sheepish passing it along to a friend.	2002-01-23

On the negative side, there is little previously uncharted territory and even less drama. The text is so chock full of short quotes, terms, phrases, names, units and minor details that the story is lost among the data.<br />For a person keenly interested in the precise alignment of troops, the battle organizational details, and plentiful quotations from common soldiers as well as generals, this is a fine work. Culp's Hill and cavalry action are detailed, not just Pickett's charge. Yet the overall impression fails to capture the glory, the courage, the drama or the simple bewilderment of the day. Several Medal of Honor winners receive less than a paragraph's treatment. Late analysis of some of the shortcomings of leadership, staff work, and vision found in the Confederacy's failure that day comes too little and too late. Despite generally good maps (two or three more with a few more details on barns, houses, roads, fences, etc. would have helped) some movements and progressions are hard to follow.<br />The author deserves full marks for copious research. The book just needs some more attention to life, a story, or simply a connecting theme to characterize the drama that  may have determined the destiny of our nation.	2002-01-08

His life has received significant attention. William Manchester has written highly successful, detailed and readable Churchill biographies. On this last point, Jenkins falls behind.<br />Like Churchill, Jenkins has been a Member of Parliament. Like Churchill, Jenkins has had a parallel career as an author. Unlike Churchill, Jenkins fortunately does not appear to have the Churchill lifestyle that demands the constant pursuit of money to fund it. One fascinating aspect of Churchill's life was his prolific command of the spoken and written word, including his memorized speeches and his numerous books.<br />Jenkins offers a short glossary of English parliamentary terms to the (American) reader. This should have been a warning. This book is clearly written for the English reader, one acquainted not only with England's parliament and politicians but also its history, titles, castles and royalty. The glossary is woefully incomplete for the unprepared reader.  An awful lot is lost in the 'translation' from English to American. While the depth and quantity of the research is memorable, little of it is new, and much of it requires a thorough grounding in English history to appreciate the rapid shift among names, characters, titles, historical events, places, wars, battles and more. And Jenkins glosses over claims by others that Churchill's conception was premarital, simply describing his birth seven months after his parents' marriage as premature. And his escape from South Africa receives short shrift. Churchill was both a charismatic and a flawed hero. Little of that comes through here.<br />Jenkins use of words like 'tergiversation' will send most people to their dictionaries, not just their Oxford histories. As much as I admire Churchill, loved Manchester's books, and wanted to like this well-reviewed work, I came away more frustrated and tired than engaged by the life of oneof history's finest.	2002-01-08
US	52891206	R24HN992BD6GCQ	0312186967	776066517	Publish and Perish: Three Tales of Tenure and Terror	Books	3	8	11	N	Y	Mix(ed bag) of humor, terror, and academic life	Hynes offers up an at-times macabre blend of witchcraft, paranoia, and petty campus politics in three short stories/novellas. My conclusions are equally mixed.<br />As one with no special love for cats, for me the first story was frustratingly driven by an irksome feline, although producing more comic relief than terror. The second story, very much an homage to Edgar Allen Poe (and acknowledged by the author to be based on another, earlier short story), became transparent early on, stripping the story of surprise and leaving the rest of the story to reveal the grisly details. The third work, remarkably woven into the first two, a la David Lodge, was the best of the three, although witchcraft had more to do with the results than any academic talent or story.<br />Characters are well drawn and the context provides a realistic setting for the work: offices, conferences, professors' lodging, and campus landmarks. Hynes obviously has spent a lot of time on campus.<br />Universities provide fertile ground for stories. Professors use their skills, especially in the humanities, to build their resumes and to poke fun at the foibles of academic life. And, given that there seems to be more time absorbed by sex and sordid affairs than by teaching or doing any research, writing anything at all must seem miraculous to the reader. But rare be the campus treatise that captures the life of an academic. &quot;Luck Jim&quot;, &quot;Groves of Academe&quot; and others have been popular but quite unrealistically overdrawn. Richard Russo's deft &quot;Straight Man&quot; is the best and funniest university novel I've read. As an academic myself, the concept of &quot;Perish&quot; had a dark appeal and, while I read it quickly, I felt more relieved than rejuvenated at the end.	2002-01-01

McCarthy's Henry Mulcahy is strapped by poverty, with a sickly wife and four children, in a temporary teaching position offered, in part, out of a sense of guilt by the college president. Then Mulcahy gets the dreaded and unexpected &quot;non-renewal&quot; letter.<br />Some aspects of academic life have not changed in fifty years: petty squabbles and politics, the longing for job security, the poor wages of some professors, the need for intrinsic interest in teaching, the complaints about students' habits. But the focus on communism and loyalty oaths as a basis for job insecurity is a distant memory to most people. And Mulcahy's own dishonesty (or grasp of reality) left me confused rather than sympathetic. Rather I found myself attuned to Mulcahy's nemesis, the president.<br />The story is simple yet the tone of the book put me off. There was more philosophy than conversation, and when academics did speak, they spoke in a fashion most would find hard to expect in conversation. I grew bored. The characters weren't that interesting despite their intelligence, and I found myself speed reading the last thirty pages. And I found myself as displeased with &quot;Groves&quot; as I had been with &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;.<br />Sometimes very literate and well-educated authors don't translate well to my level, to meet my self-admittedly need for a clearer, more linear story and engaging characters.	2001-12-31

And any reader can see how such a book gives all the liberals (who also consider themselves to be &quot;middle of the road&quot;) fits. And the cold, hard facts on the political views and agendas of reporters are simply ignored by the anchors. And the anchors are protected from any tough questioning of their own motives and practices. Instead, the anchors use invective against Goldberg and uncriticized pallatives to defend their credentials. Dan Rather doesn't get a tough question from Larry King's interview. And Rather wouldn't dare field questions from Tim Russert.<br />Goldberg, no conservative himself, skewers Dan Rather, who has taken on the  paranoid, thin-skinned characteristics of the very man who made Rather famous -- Richard Nixon. Goldberg shows the blatant yet obviously overlooked bias in reporting on subjects such as homelessness, AIDS, Ronald Reagan, discrimination, and feminists. He presents the evidence in a clear, compelling fashion. Lots of quotes and notes from the elite and their critics. Good secondary research. Bright, sharp examples and anecdotes.<br />Goldberg's biggest problem is that he is seen as a traitor and not a whistleblower. And that's ABC's, CBS's and NBC's biggest problem as well. Had the Big Three listened, they might not be looking at their dramatic decline in viewership for the evening news, from 75% of home to 43% of homes in the last twenty or so years.<br />This book is certain to stick in the throats of Dan Rather, CBS execs, and any person who ever voted for Bill Clinton.	2001-12-29

As a seventeen-year Mac user, I was near wit's end when I went for this manual, needing just what its title implied.<br />The \\"missing manual\\" helps but also misses the mark. Hey, I'm no techie.

Journalism is not, as her editor suggests, going out and pretending to be someone you're not in order to imagine what it might really be like if one only weren't pretending. Journalism or even good, basic writing about life, requires a better locating and understanding of the facts, and then applying some consistent logic to the analysis.    Worse, Ehrenreich doesn't even come close to approximating the real conditions of the people she is attempting to imitate. She owns a car. She stakes herself to start up funds. She picks where she wants to go to work. She refuses to share a room with anyone. Her \\"real life experience\\" is not real, not life and not much of an experience. She declines to use public transportation because she'd have too much material stemming from the time on the bus. She would have been wise to reflect on the bus and to skip the self-indulgent auto.    At work, she ignores the obvious and responds to gossip and her biases. She plays cute when she wants to, assumes management is evil and that her co-workers are innocent victims, acts surprised and is unable or unwilling to comprehend that poor lifestyle choices condemn some people to a downward spiral, and she does nothing to consider her lot in this assumed life.    Many Americans -- in fact, tens of millions of them -- have experienced the same work she casually explores. But, most of those millions used this work experience as a stepping stone to further work. These same people also made these same work sacrifices, postponed gratification, kept off drugs, stayed out of jail, remained married, shared rooms, walked to work, studied on the side, and learned important lessons from demeaning jobs. Lessons like showing up for work on time, learning work skills, putting in something extra to get ahead and, perhaps most important, that a job is most often a dead end only if you let it be one.    Her archival research, witnessed by scant, odd footnotes, is at times drawn fromspecial interest groups. She uses them to reinforce her snide asides, not to illuminate or to expand upon an observation. Better research and a much more enlightening and satisfying read is the very well-documented and straightforward \\"The millionaire next door\\", a book that resulted from two serious authors finding that their original assumptions did not stand up to the data and to reality. Or read Cox and Alm's richly detailed 1999 book, \\" Myths of rich and poor\\" (Basic). Check your biases at the door, look at the facts, and report with clarity.    Yes, there are bad jobs, bad companies, and bad people out there. But this book does not help anyone understand how to break the circle of poverty or how to simply be a better person, employer or work colleague.	2001-12-27

It was a good book, in part because of the decision to focus on a few fateful days and the key decision makers that forged history. With &quot;April 1865&quot;, Winik uses the same approach, covering a span of thirty days, and achieves a marvelous result. This is a great book.<br />Casual readers of history (meaning few Americans) are not likely to be fully cognizant of the slender thread that held the nation together in the last month of the war, with Lee's surrender on in early April and Lincoln's death a few days later. Even fewer Americans know just how delicate the situation became as the war came to a close. Other events stormed around these historic memories. The egos and decisions of generals Grant, Sherman, Johnston, and Mosby played a large part in the end of the war and the start of the peace. And the politicians, namely Lincoln, Johnson and Davis, had to work very hard that the peace was not more disruptive than the war.<br />Winik asks and adderesses basic questions about motives in the North and in the South. What role did emancipation play in the North and in the South? What plan for peace did Lincoln have? What made Lee fianlly choose to surrender? Why didn't the South extend the battle into a guerrila war? Why did President Davis decline to give up after Lee surendered? What might have happended had Lincoln survived?<br />Winik makes a compelling case that small events, basic decisions, and the character of people can color great events and make for a better world. A few good maps and integrated, thorough endnotes make &quot;April 1865&quot; easy to read. His 'thumbnail' biographies of the key players provide good explanations for the complex motives that produced peace at the end of four years of terrible war. And that color our national culture to this day.	2001-12-23

Ken Follet takes us back to a romanticized version from fifty years ago, with a thriller about espionage, Resistance fighters, SOE, MI5, Gestapo, and the SS.<br />This is a very familiar setting and theme. Fifteen years ago, Larry Collins' &quot;Fall from grace&quot; did an excellent job of creating for the reader a cat-and-mouse game of spies, agents, and Resistance fighters attempting to pave the way for D-Day. It remains a definitive piece of Resistance fiction. And the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; film earned worldwide popularity with its collection of misfits taking on the German elite in their lair.<br />&quot;Jackdaws&quot; is a rich blend of both of these, with the usual dashing, handsome and beautiful, sexy, multilingual,  heroic, tormented yet highly motivated characters on both sides of the conflict. Follett makes full use of our fascination and respect for people who for the right reasons put themselves into terrible situations, fictional, semi-fictional or historically accurate.<br />Some readers have and will decry the chauvinist or simply politically incorrect use of the strange group of women  Follett assembled to sabotage the critical German communications link immediately before D-Day. For me, it is another interesting twist on an old, oft-worked theme. Sure, Follett's lesbian characters are drawn with a man's hand, but authors have always struggled to reach outside their own experiences, even if stereotypes necessarily result. And scenarios stretch reality, but fiction has that right as well.<br />Jack Higgins used to do a good job with this genre, before he went over to more modern times and the IRA. Follett remains a first-class writer of World War-based fiction. And &quot;Jackdaws&quot; will not disappoint.	2001-12-15

As part of the recovery, people try to assemble their lives shattered by the war. There are the two lovers, one American and one German, separated for four years. There is the German scientist, eagerly sought by the Americans. There are the Russians, stereotyped as intent primarily on rape, revenge and pillage. And then there is the dead American, shot after the fighting, found at the time and location of the Potsdam Conference.

In praising him, he challenged those around him to address issues that continue to interest and perplex him. And, despite his years of experience and two million books of his own in print, the questions that remain are often simple and profound.<br />Answering these questions are top researchers, professors, commentators and consultants. The variety of authors provides a rich tapestry of information, experiences and opinions. What are the keys to great leadership? What makes one high-performing team do great things (The Manhattan Project) and another perpetrate evil (The Final Solution)? As the percent of one's life likely to be engaged in full-time employment declines (from 50 of 68 years in 1960 to 38 of 76 years today), how does this affect the way we lead and live? What happens when good leaders go bad? Is leadership aptitude widely distributed or possessed by a select few? Are business schools up to the task of developing the management and leadership talent for tomorrow?<br />Given the approximately hundreds of articles and dozens of books on leadership published each year, you might expect to have had these answers or at least these questions raised before. &quot;The future of leadership&quot; offers a fresh, readable perspective, for the business student and the manager. Sure, you might quibble with the eclectic responses and styles of this broad spectrum of authors, but the quality lies in their diversity.	2001-12-12

The hero is handsome, brilliant and dashing. His wife is stunning, tall, brilliant and only a little less dashing. The book jumps back and forth between the time the collection of key characters meet at Harvard in 1941 and the same set converge again at the time of the first American space launch in 1958.<br />In between, there are wars to be fought, affairs to ignite, and traitors to flush out. The basic premise of a man finding himself dirty and without memory, struggling to regain his own sense of self is an old story line. Yet it sets off a plausible and generally entertaining and exciting chain of events.<br />In his typical fashion, Follett does a good job of drawing the reder into his story, cliches and all. Books such as these, unless there is a compelling story, should be set aside very quickly or not read at all. Instead, despite the stereotypes and aged images, this is an enjoyable read. Yes, some of the situations are a bit too standard and two or more characters are more cartoons than characters, but Follett uses history as a method to weave together a not unlikely plot and even to throw in a few twists and turns along the way.<br />Great airplane paperback reading.	2001-12-07

Other than a revealing comment or two from Dan Rather, most of the interviewees' thoughts are thin and predictible. There is little substance and no surprises.<br />Second, he overestimates his impact on the American people, perhaps having read his clippings or admired his photo on the cover of TV Guide once too often. An admitted egotist, he thinks he's an egoist. Only a tiny fraction of the population watches his show and, I expect, even fewer are changed by his interviews. Some might get &quot;charged&quot;, but not changed. The book's chapter of letters from viewers shows that people can confuse him for a variety of political viewpoints. He thinks this shows us people are dumb or they don't understand him. I think it may be because he doesn't really have a well thought out political philosophy at all.<br />And this makes the third point: his political, social and economic recommendations are not very well developed. For example, he recommends dropping the regressive 12% &quot;Social Security&quot; tax, only to replace it with an even more regressive national sales tax. Another: He would &quot;suggest&quot; that auto companies make more fuel-efficient cars or to threaten them with taxes on the vehicles, when a better way would be simply to place higher taxes on gasoline or carbon. Again: He decries abortion but takes a nice middle ground of not prohibiting it. I could go on...<br />O'Reilly earns his recognition and many points for challenging his guests, and loses some back with his near-rudeness disguised as intolerance to spin. He has a spin of his own. The fact is that we need more education and less &quot;spin&quot;. And even the &quot;no spin&quot; zone is less than an education.<br />This very short book might have warranted a magazine interview of him, but that would not have enabled O'Reilly to control the spin or to capitalize on his reputation among the journalistic and political set. Sure, he's feisty and appears interested in challenging Rush Limbaugh's radio show's dominance. But he needs some more thought and substance to go before his desire to put out a book. Save your money .	2001-11-20

Both men served in Europe. After lengthy training, they did not enter battle until 1944. Winters fought his way from Normandy to Holland to Bastogne to Bavaria to Austria. McGovern flew from Italy, the &quot;forgotten&quot; front of the European air battle. But there's more.<br />In &quot;Blue&quot;, George McGovern plays the part of the much-admired Captain Winters in &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. Both men show unswerving strength of judgment, character and commitment in completing their missions and leading their men. They earn the respect of all for their skill and their leadership, McGovern in the air and Winters on the ground.<br />Ambrose has made a remarkable career and no small fortune by tapping the memories of these heroic men. By focusing on men who did not earn fame as a war hero at the time, Ambrose reinforces Winters' comment that although he was not a hero, he served with many of them. Ambrose's clear, almost pedestrian writing style, converting interviews and some historical data into straightforward prose shows that McGovern and Winters were heroes, best proved by the fact that they didn't necessarily see themselves as such.<br />Ambrose also catalogs the death and destruction of World War II. The rigorous training, the thousands of deaths just in training exercises and accidents, the uncertainty of life, the black walls (&quot;boxes&quot;) of flak (McGovern notes at least times, when viewing flak, that &quot;hell can't be worse than this&quot;), and the daily lesson of lives instantly snuffed out by a well-placed shell or a slip of concentration.<br />A fitting read for Veteran's Day. A nice companion to &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. A bit too relenting in the style and tone.	2001-11-10

Why not simply say &quot;no&quot; to Christmas? &quot;No&quot; to the neighbors decorating their homes, to the Boy Scouts selling trees, to the policeman selling calendars, to medics selling fruitcakes...just say &quot;no&quot; to everyone and everything concerning Christmas. Take all that money you spend on mindless cards, trinkets, and parties and spend it on something half the cost and much less stressful, like a cruise. Perhaps the only sentiment stronger than the tempatation to pass on the anxiety, crass commercialism, drunken office parties and competitive neighborhood decorations must be the nostalgia we all have for Bing Crosby White Christmas past. The Kranks fight hard to stay the course.<br />A slim, fast read, it would be a shame to deter the prospective reader by revealing the plot twist but it is transparent and predictable. But it's also fun, and heartwarming. A nice Christmas gift.	2001-11-07

Nothing and everything prepared him for the presidency, be it the &quot;failed&quot; haberdashery back home or his record of not losing a single man in his unit in World War II. Or his fights against corruption while having risen from one of the more corrupt political machines.<br />Having written some excellent earlier historic works, McCullough moved to a higher level with this great book. It is both intricate and facile, detailed and friendly, historic and familiar. The reader can't help but develop an appreciation for the subject and the author.	2001-11-07

From Bush's rapid 1992 fall from grace following his Gulf War high, to the bumblings of the Clinton administration, Halberstarm adds intricacies of people, places and events, tying in less visible characters.<br />Clinton rose to the presidency when the more significant Democratic players calculated (incorrectly) that the Gulf War triumph made Bush unbeatable. Clinton the opportunist, had nothing to lose by running. Running was his life and this was too good a chance to pass on, even if he'd promised Arkansans he wouldn't run. It was not to be the first time he changed his mind and broke a promise, nor his last. Sadly, what Halberstam aptly describes, is that the Clinton administration was like the dog who finally catches the car he's been chasing. Lips firmly around the tailpipe, Clinton had to wonder: &quot;Now what?&quot; From Haitian immigration policy (Oops, I didn't mean it!), to Bosnia (I didn't understand what I was saying when I was running.), to gays in the military (You mean there might be a problem if we do what I said I would?), the dream of becoming president was shattered by Clinton's deaf ear to foreign policy and his intimate knowledge of the polled populace. Only foreign affairs are not as neat as domestic issues and the polls and the people turn quickly. Just ask his predecessor.<br />Clinton's domestic policy successes were best described by what he didn't do: a failed health care plan and doing no harm to the economy, poised for a recovery. What he did do was more harmful to his own interests: reduce the military and turn over his party's control of congress by 1994 and, by 2000, the White House, over to the Republicans. And his lame attempt to 'attack' Bin Laden has come back to haunt us terribly.<br />Statesmanship requires deep-seated knowledge and courage, not a quick study, a facile analysis, or feet of clay. Both Clinton and George Bush, Sr. lacked &quot;the vision thing&quot; when it came to foreign policy. Let's hope that George Dubya, finding foreign policy crises thrust upon him, surfaces a vision of his own.<br />Halberstam must have done a lot of research or else he has a canny way for reading the minds of the players. As he did in &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, he reconstructs the decline of an important American greatness. Not recommended for the impatient or the weak of spirit.	2001-11-04

Humor stems from the author's style and the now-apparent, foolish ambition of Craig Winn and his Value America colleagues. Winn wasn't alone, and maybe 'ambition' is too kind. &quot;Arrogance&quot; might be a better term, shared by a lot of egomaniacs posing as entrepreneurs, launching dot.coms in the late 1990s. Sadness, because it would have been such a nice story if the tulip mania bubble didn't burst, and all of us were today equally drunk with wealth from these new economy firms.<br />Strangely, some of this reads like ancient history. Value America came and went so fast, determined to be the marketplace for the new millenium, the web site for everybody, satisfying shoppers' seven 'needs', doing four important functions perfectly, and never holding any inventory. First hints of the real mess they did have in inventory postponed their original IPO in 1998, only to see Value America rush right back into the IPO market in April 1999, with visions of billions of dollars in stock value at a time when $30 million in quarterly sales (along with millions more in losses) constituted their entire revenue stream. And most of that business was over the phone!<br />Winn comes across as a man easily impressed by himself. Within months of initial signs of success, he has his gubernatorial campaign laid out and his plans to be president by 2008 are going full steam ahead. From brief conversations with Henry Kissinger and Bill Bennett, Winn thinks he has a campaign advisory team. And all the time Winn ignores the fact that his business model is not working, his basic assumptions are incorrect, and his disbelief as to his naysayers is misplaced.<br />The concept was simple, elegant and very marketable to the venture capitalists convinced that they only had to be right one in twenty times and they'd still come out rich. Only the seductive pitch lacked details, specifics, and good-old-fashioned business sense. Welcome to &quot;duediligence&quot;.<br />A must read for those who are all-too-quickly forgetting the hard e-commerce lessons learned from 1998 to 2000.	2001-10-29

College admissions staff have many stories to tell. Toor tells plenty about applicants, admissions officers, and her friends. This is a personal case study, not empirical research, so any findings or conclusions should be viewed with real caution. Many will find it too personal and, at times, self-centered. Personally, I would have been glad to forego the pig stories, and I'm not referring to applicants.<br />That said, writing here as a long-time university professor and administrator, none of what Toor wrote surprised me. In fact, I continue to be more surprised by people who think that students applying to great schools are admitted based only on their SATs, just like some parents believe that students at large public universities have full-time professors teaching all the first-year classes.<br />Toor reports the abundant resources (if low pay for admissions staff), intense competition and sometimes convuluted admissions decisions of one of our most prestigious schools. The portfolio of scores, skills, essays, recommendations, extracurriculars and other facets of the first twelve years of an education comes under closer scrutiny than any of the work the student is likely to put forth in his or her classes in the coming four years. The investment part of the educational model at Duke appears to be spent in the admissions office, not saved for the classroom.<br />Research shows, contrary to the elitist assertion repeated here, that it matters less what university you attend than to what university you are admitted. Its the admissions process that is the hallmark of the top schools, not the academic experience itself. Get admitted to Penn State and Princeton, attend Penn State, and statistics show that the graduate will do as well having attended Penn State instead of Princeton. And she will have saved enough money in four years to fund much of her entire retirement. Strange but true. So it just might be worth finding out if you can cut it in the (Duke) admissions rounds. Pray you get admitted. But then save your money and attend a good but affordable school.	2001-10-27

The father did not live to see the bridge built. The son, for a variety of reasons, suffered so much from the physical and mental demands of the job that he might qualify as the &quot;mad&quot; bridgebuilder in the minds of many. McCollough offers extensive detail of the people, the politics, and the history. The science and engineering is a lot harder to follow, unless you have the mathematical and analytical rigor to follow along. Perhaps some more charts and figures would have helped.<br />This is a long, hard read. The bridge was a longer, harder act. At times I felt like I was going to take as long to read the book as it took to build the bridge.	2001-10-27

Someone forgot to tell them that water runs downhill, so you better build one heckuva strong damn to hold that lake. Hard to believe that such capricious arrogance could condemn so many people to an awful death.<br />McCullough is a great story teller. Perhaps he stretches his research or his creditbility at times with attempts to infer motives or describe thoughts, but this does not take away from the historical fact: One fateful day, the dam burst, poured down a narrow valley, and swamped the poor citizens of Johnston. The power of the water was such that it swept up the wooden houses, drove them against a stronger bridge across the river, and created an inferno that burned people alive. McCullough does an excellent job of reporting the decisions that led to this tragedy and the horrible events of that fateful day. And then there were the incriminations.<br />Highly recommended for any student of history.	2001-10-27

Is the white male in the work force rapidly becoming a minority? Are 150,000 young American women dying each year from anorexia?<br />Joel Best clearly answers &quot;no&quot; to each of these three questions and, more importantly, shows why many people would say &quot;yes&quot;. His point is that descriptive statistics are the product of a social activity, not just a representation of society. Social advocacy causes people to collect the data that they feel will best support their preconceived notions: They talk to unrepresentative groups. They start to collect new measures and then wonder why the &quot;statistics&quot; have grown since ten years earlier (when they weren't much -- if at all -- measured). They multiply erroneous assumptions. They mutate data. And the press and other publications carry the mutations forward.<br />This book offers plenty of illustrations of intentions run amok. Many of the reports provide useful information for a classroom lecture on the need to discern if a person is &quot;speaking rot&quot;, as Harold Macmillan once said was the primary purpose of an education.<br />A good, crisp 171 pages in length, it is absent discussion of the more difficult inferential statistics and, as a result, it is easy to understand by the lay person.	2001-10-09

And, given the Clinton predispositon towards the military, and institution he &quot;loathed&quot;, Americans might not expect much from a small albeit dedicated group of fighters in this African cell of poverty and turmoil.<br />Bowden does a fantastic job of showing the personal side of heroism, of depicting modern warriors who go unrespected or unnoticed in their own countries. Taking a small, &quot;botched&quot; military operation, underresourced and quickly planned, Bowden adeptly portrays the people who live and die to help make sure that we continue to live and die in freedom. These men illustrate valor and commitment, to one another and in the name of an unappreciative government. Mostly without the seemingly everpresent CNN live world coverage, a small number of men accomplished a lot with a little.<br />The September 11 events make us grateful that we have soldier warriors like these men.	2001-10-03

In twenty-one years, he changed an American icon into a global juggernaut. He created millionaires by the score.<br />Few investors, globalists or capitalists can argue with the financial success of his methods. His &quot;fix, sell, or close&quot; strategy, along with his determination to be Number 1 or Number 2 in any market, has become an MBA case study mantra. His &quot;Neutron Jack&quot; moniker, is a harsher reputation than he deserves, but an accurate image of his desire to shed unproductive jobs. He notes that the jobs had to go, not the people, but they both did. We remember the people, not the jobs.<br />He introduced basic, visionary themes to GE: the boundaryless firm, statistics-laden but leader-driven Six Sigma (but how he &quot;reduced the vibrations by 300%&quot;, p. 334, I still can't understand), and e-business. He was simultaneously a cheerleader and one very tough manager. His method of driving out of GE the bottom ten pecent of his performers strikes me as a harsh, Spencerian &quot;Survivor&quot; contest, although it appears to be accepted as a service to those top performers who were left standing. Failing to make budget goals or targets may merit a demotion, even a termination. But this decimation process may be a step too far.<br />He re-built in-house, management education at his Crotonville facility, restoring what had become a lost art. He taught many of the student-managers himself. He clearly has a gift for names, details and the big picture. He has been very willing to gamble big, both on projects and people. His winning percentage appears to have been very high.<br />He is an avid golfer. No, he played A LOT of golf. This appears to be a generational and corporate feature not enjoyed by many aspiring managers today. There is little glimpse of the personal side of the man until he introduces his second wife in the second half of the book. After 28 years of marriage, he all-too-casually seems to write off his first marriage as some personal form of his own &quot;fix, sell or close&quot; strategy. But he claims they remain the best of friends. Later, when questioned as to &quot;How can you be a good Catholic and a businessman at the same time,&quot; he answers simply, &quot;I am.&quot; He offers little evidence other than to claim that his first priority was to &quot;maintain integrity&quot;, and that he was always &quot;straight and honest&quot;. It would have helped to read more about his personal values, other than those manifested in golf and his second marriage.<br />His late chapter, &quot;What this CEO thing is all about,&quot; really leaves a serious reader looking for more substance, content and structure. But this is not that kind of a book. This is a highly readable book, despite the plethora of names that are required to poputlate the life of the leader of such a large organization. He doesn't bog down in details and it is clear that his primary regret after forty years is that he did not move fast enough. My regret is that he did not stop long enough to reflect.	2001-10-02

The Mason-Dixon line is more about the greed of powerful colonial families, fighting for every square mile of claimed territory than it is about slavery, geography or history.<br />Yes, this same personal greed drove the development of technology. Even the British government got into the act, offering a reward for a better measuring instrument. Even then, the goal was to master naval power, trading, and economic development, not to advance technology.<br />The opening chapters summarize the give and take of English royalty, Catholic and Protestant, and their desire to divide up the New World. All this dithering and bloodshed did produce an agreement on one thing: Unless we can get someone to draw the line somewhere and to everyone's satisfaction, all of the dithering and bloodshed will continue. Mason and Dixon were just the guys they needed. Only this same line of &quot;peace&quot; became the demarcation for the American Civil War two hundred years later.<br />Recommended only for the math-savvy and the hardcore history buffs.

This is the work of one of England's angry young men? Now I'm one of the angry ones.\\" It took a BBC series to bring the characters to life in a way not immediately clear to me on the written page. Putting the words on video greatly increased my sympathy for Jim.<br />Nonetheless, I think son Martin Amis did a funnier job with a similarly self-absorbed, self-centered slob in \\"Money: A suicide note\\". While I can see where son Martin found and derived his inspiration, I found less humor and little insight from the father.<br />Lucky Jim Dixon is often more loathesome than likeable. His own sense of humor -- childish practical jokes of revenge on his enemies -- is more petty and mean than inspired. He doesn't much care for his students (except perhaps the pretty girls), his colleagues, or (for better reasons) his \\"superiors\\". Reading \\"Lucky Jim\\", I pictured a young Peter O'Toole or perhaps Hugh Grant drinking and stumbling his way through a good job, more concerned about his cigarette and beer budget than anything intellectual, romantic, noble, or heroic.<br />Other than his contrast to the even more boorish son (Betrand) of Dixon's superior, it is still hard to understand the basis for the lucky outcome that concludes the book. Lucky for Jim, not just his students that, Dixon found another career.	2001-09-28

He surely has a fine, if basic comic flair. One can't help but feel that much of the great body of work he has written in the past thirty of so years is very autobiographical, but even that charge he attempts to address in this recent work, a reflection on the elusiveness of success defined in one's own terms.<br />This is a ninety-minute reading, built around the play on which it is based. It does &quot;read&quot; like a play, but that is not a hindrance. Lodge makes his points quickly and adroitly. The four characters expose themselves with ease, although there is less sex than there is history. After all, the main characters are now near fifty. Life has had some sad turns. The young interloper provides the basis for opening old wounds.<br />For aging boomers, who once felt that their lives and careers held great promise, this will offer some reflection.	2001-09-24

Placing almost al of the action in the fuselage of the damaged plane limits his stage. The details of decompression at high altitude are not pretty. The male and female leads are heroic. The victimized pilot of the fighter that fired the deadly shot is a good, if side story.<br />The conclusions are somewhat predictable.

He creates an identifiable, likeable, male lead. But this is one of his weakest works, about a small-town guy who returns from sadness in the big city, only to find himself immersed in the small-time life he thought he had set aside years ago. Enter the old girl friend, with an abusive boy friend and soon you have a struggle between good and evil with an antagonist not worth our time. He makes the hero less heroic. And the dark side of domestic abuse simply does not rouse the interest, passion, or even sympathy for the characters of his other books.<br />I'd pass on this.

Visit the lovely University College Cork. This city typifies an American's bright stereotype of the Emerald Isle, yet Cork is also a working city. It overflows with history, greets you with charm, and induces a smile even on the world traveler.	2001-09-17

In light of the horrible events of September 11, 2001, the book can now be read in another light.<br />Like his other international novels, DeMille wraps together disparate elements into an intriguing whole. This time, it's the terrorist moved by the attack on Khadaffi, and this month's events put some reality to this fiction.<br />A great, gripping read.	2001-09-17

To paraphrase: It is well known and well-established that, in the United States, a person has a less than one percent chance of being poor for long, if that person does three things: complete high school, work one year even at the minimum wage, and get and stay married.<br />Waite and Gallagher provide the full treatment for this last, perhaps most important element of poverty prevention. Hillary Clinton missed the point: Families, not villages, raise children. And, if we follow Clinton, we'll all be the sorrier for such a loss of the real, meaningful social and economic foundation of society: the family.<br />Families generate economies of scale and job specialization. Children in families become investments, not expenses. Families provide built-in, free baby sitting, day care, education, tutoring and entertainment.<br />A student once responded to my question about teaching abstinence to prevent AIDS, implying my position as a moralistic, religious sanction. Sorry, she was wrong. Just because it's morally correct does not mean that there is no rational basis for the belief.	2001-09-10

Lukacs' neat, short work shows that not only did the war begin in earnest more than two years earlier, he shows that a few old white males meeting in London in May 1940 set the course of the war and the world simply by sticking to their guns during England's darkest, finest hours.<br />Lukacs shows how close England came to considering some form of capitulation. Using detailed notes and diaries and marvelous studies of English morale by means of quite-modern market research done in real time, Lukacs paints five incredible days.	2001-09-10

To create a sense of country life in the Pennsylvania mountains, a few very wealthy people played with Mother Nature, building a cheap damn to form a lovely lake. But the lake proved to be more powerful than the dam, and tragedy poured out. Country lifestyles of the rich and famous came tumbling down a narrow gorge, nearly wiped Johnstown off the map, and forever changed the way Americans looked at dams.<br />Any school child or any adult who believes that history is boring or absent color simply needs to read this fine book, not only to enjoy a good story but also to learn how charmed lives, misplaced hope, ill-managed technology and simple human error can combine to make tragedy.<br />If this were fiction, you'd marvel at how he made it up.

As an Englishman, Mead appreciates and extols the Americans.<BR>Death and destruction on a grand scale, with gas, tanks, machine guns, and blatantly incompetent leaders were the way of the war for three long years before the Americans arrived, however woefully unprepared they were for trench combat. Pershing thought that flexible fighting, using the almost discarded rifle (the Allies had come to prefer a sack of grenades as the weapon of choice), could overcome the stalemate of the muddy ditches. Mead shows the importance of the American combat troops and, perhaps most important, their boost to materiel and morale at a time when the Allies, especially the French, were near paralysis if not collapse. The French troops' mutiny and executions of a few of those convicted makes the point.<br />The detailed exceprts from diaries and reports from those at the front, including those who did not survive the war, make this a great tale to tell. General Pershing's had to fight the Allies to achieve and maintain American independence in the face of Allied presumption that he would simply surrender his troops and command to the British, French, or Italians (e.g., &quot;If you could just send us 1,000,000 troops, we'll equip them and let them fight with my men.&quot;) The British were worse; they assumed that since their ships transported American troops, that the Americans ought to fight under British command.<br />The diappointment is in the book's organization and, painfully, the maps. There is a needless side trip to the Siberian &quot;front&quot;. Mead jumps around time and places. The maps appear at apparently random places in the book, with later battle maps preceding earlier ones, and the lines of advance and the cities and places where troops fought were exasperatingly difficult to match up. The &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; received little attention and the maps left me lost trying to find them.<br />Thanks for salvaging the American contribution. But give me good maps!	2001-09-08

He sticks to highlights and readily acknowledges and quotes the several more historic, academic and detailed Cleveland biographies. He makes some facile comparisons to Bill Clinton, some of which work and others that are a bit of stretch. Unlike Clinton, Cleveland was honest and not terribly schooled or bright. Both men worked and played long hours. Like Clinton, Cleveland was a large man, with a huge appetite for food (Cleveland liked sauerkraut and sausage, a fair predecessor to Clinton's Big Mac attacks) and -- and here it gets murky -- women. Cleveland, nearing fifty, first married his recently college graduated ward. But the story of his child out-of-wedlock many years earlier almost did him in. Unlike Clinton, and perhaps becuase he was a bachelor, he did not deny fatherhood, even though it was not clear that he was the father.<br />Cleveland's political ascent was remarkable: in five years he was elected mayor of Buffalo, governor of New York, and then president of the United States, only to lose his second run for the presidency and to come back and win on his third try. His concern over public office as a public trust, over the gold standard and tariffs, offer some insights into today's currency and free trade arguments.<br />An interesting and not terribly complex man, Cleveland was a much better president than Clinton, whose greatest legacy was to turn over the White House and Congress to the Republicans and to turn the public spotlight on private sexual matters.	2001-08-31

Cramer writes with a wonderful, personal style, a sense of being there that tests credulity, as he fleshes out conversations and events from sixty or seventy years ago, without the assistance of the primary subject. This lack of cooperation from DiMaggio is both the strength and the weakness of the book.<br />Baseball in the late 1930's had truly wonderful moments, in a era when it was the national pasttime, when trains preceded airplanes, radio preceded television, and World Series winnings could double or triple a player's annual salary. DiMaggio arrived at the time Ruth exited and Joe was there to see the end of Gehrig's career. Cramer introduces Joe in 1930 and richly catalogs the rapid ascent from North Beach to New York.<br />Cramer almost sounds a bit mean-spirited, to use a term overused by Democrats today. But Cramer is not one to sugar coat. And DiMaggio could be mean. Joe DiMaggio was a little-educated son of an immigrant who had greatness thrust upon him. Sure, he wanted it, but he wanted fame on his own terms. And that is not the deal the devil makes when he gives the athletic skills, the New York stage, and the Hollywood starlet-filled life that the Yankee Clipper received. You can simultaneously admire and feel sorry for DiMaggio. DiMaggio had his selfishness, his conceits, his self-imagined slights. But could he play ball! Enjoy the life story of a great athlete.	2001-08-31

Balkoski's marketing of this edition benefits from the overused Ambrose cache. Otherwise, the writing style is workmanlike, instead of inspiring or greatly illuminating. &quot;Beachhead&quot; reads like the late-assembled memoirs of a veteran, many years after the events.

He was good at selecting, cajoling and inspiring men. How he brought his crew back alive from such a frozen, forbidding world, is one of the amazing miracles of the past two hundred years.<BR>Yet a close, hard look suggests that the leadership lessons to be learned are limited for most readers. The authors try too hard to take each Shackleton episode or act as a lesson tobe learned and applied yet these lessons are not as clear as the authors might want to suggest nor are the lessons necessarily generalizeable to modern life or commerce. After reading the entire book, little remains to explain Shackleton's theory or practice of leadership, just a lot of anecdotes and incidents. Shackleton and his leadership remain inscrutable.<BR>An amazing story, yes. An amazing leadership book, I think not.	2001-08-29

Larson brings history to life with a stirring, clear, fast-paced account of the storm itself and, more importantly, the possible ways tragedy could have been avoided and the way heroes and scapegoats emerge, sometimes inaccurately.

Inspired by a Lexus factory and a farmer protecting his olive tree, Friedman offers a clear, informal description of globalization. He seems to endorse global free market capitalism and free trade. So the description is pretty much spot on. But then there's the &quot;understanding&quot; part. And here the book loses points fast... Freidman's a journalist, not an economist. And, like so many journalists, he has a liberal (not in the traditional, European use of the world, but rather in the Bill Clinton, big 'D' democrat use) bias. Friedman tries to convince the reader that if we'd only listen to Clinton and other well-intentioned, nice-sounding, politically correct politicians, journalists and pundits, we could really manage free trade, which, as any decent student of world economics knows, is an oxymoron. If you want a better analysis, read Dan Yergin's &quot;Commanding Heights&quot;. Or David Landes' &quot;Wealth and poverty of nations&quot;.

Here is my update: The title is misleading: This is a look at full-time MBA and executive (MBA) programs at the arguably best business schools in the world. This is like claiming a study to be a study of the auto industry when all the authors studied is Mercedes Benz. The real &quot;business&quot; of business schools must cover the part-time and undergraduate programs. There are transparent inconsistencies: The authors bash b-schools for promoting a cult of gurus, only the authors quote and promote gurus repeatedly. They use the same gurus to criticize the very schools that hire and promote the supposed &quot;guru&quot;. Crainer and Dearlove decry one-liners, then summarize their work with a cliched one-liner of their own: &quot;Management is pocket science, not rocket science.&quot; They tell b-schools to be customer-friendly but not to cater to the catering needs or accommodation interests of their clients. They purport to do a global study when this is at best a modest revision of a study of the few, elite European business schools, which are generaly unlike the American business school system. They imply (p. 186) that the major business school accrediting body -- the AACSB -- only changed its name to International Association of Management Education outside the U.S., and this is not true. [NOTE: And AACSB in 2001 changed its name again -- worldwide.] They criticize business deans for lacking vision, while not realizing that the &quot;independent subcontractor&quot; mode of business faculty is inconsistent with &quot;academic leadership&quot; creating a vision for such independent experts. Business schools have been successful because they produce what businesses clearly prefer to hire: knowledge workers, managers and leaders for the global economy. Business students at all levels -- undergraduate, graduate and executive -- are learning the new culture and language of the new world economy. Even as the &quot;new&quot; economy declines and former dot commers return to collect their MBAs. Business is a liberal art, much like the study of a foreign language. At the undergraduate level, where most business education is done, accredited business schools demand a well-rounded, liberal arts curriculum. B-schools are generous cash cows for universities. Sure, their faculty earn a lot but they teach large course sections and generate demand for non-business courses. If as much were spent on training top business students as is spent on the college's star quarterback, we might have even more effective business schools. The fact that innovation and leadership is absent from the &quot;top&quot; schools is a phenomenon in all industries: the top schools become rich and self-satisfied and the real change bubbles up from those struggling, niche-building programs competing for the new customers' dollar. A well-trained manager need not be a rocket scientist, but if there are design flaws in his education, Challenger-like disasters are in the making. Business education is too big and too important to be left to a few, smug, incredibly expensive schools. And we should all be grateful that it is not...	2001-08-26

From his very wonderful &quot;Changing places&quot; and &quot;Small world&quot;, Lodge has demonstrated a marvelous insight into university life. As others have noted, his earlier works are more complex and hilarious. &quot;Thinks&quot; is more cerebral.<br />With the University of Glouscester's Ralph Messenger, a cognitive scientist, Lodge broadens his venue, usually the more traditional, humane arts of English litrature. Meeting the new novelist-in-residence, Helen Reed, Messenger is able to engage in a dialog about cognition and literature, while both of the players publically and privately acknowledge that this is a seduction. Messenger seems to be overwhelmingly charming and addicted to the next available sexual conquest. Even his almost laser-like pursuit of Helen is sidetracked, if only momentarily, by a trivial pursuit, but this also allows Lodge to plague Messenger with a number of challenges as the conquest comes to its expected conclusion. Lodge also tidies up a bit at the end. Alls well that ends well.<br />English new universities have more personality than one might think, if only in the characters, if not the architecture.	2001-08-18

Zapp and Swallow are back for a colorful encore. For any well-traveled academic, or even those who travel for other reasons, you will enjoy Lodge's descriptions, insights and surprising intricacies, as characters jet across continents to yet another subsidized conference, never forgetting that the rationale for the conference is not what it is advertised to be. As any professional, well-published academic knows, the real reason to write papers to present at conferences is to be able to justify traveling to the conference where most if not all agree that there is little reason to actually read or listen to the presentations.<br />Yet beyond the trysts and tripe of these fools can be found lessons in life and romance, of the great pursuit of life. Look past the lust, the deception and the pettiness, as Lodge presents plenty of food for thought.<br />Lodge colors his well-drawn players with all the affectations of their profession: greed, pettiness, ego, banality. A wonderful job. &quot;Small world&quot; is a great, most pleasant summer escape, a humorous jab at the soft underbelly of college life -- without ever really teaching a course.	2001-08-17

David Lodge's clever story of two literature professors, both part of a mindless faculty exchange, brings the tumult and craziness of the college in the 1960's era to life. Before political correctness and sexual harassment there was free speech, student protests, and women's liberation, and Lodge deftly recreates for the reader the insane glories of those years.<br />The story opens on flights and lives traveling in quite oppostie directions in January 1969. We learn something about the protagonists en route. Loosely disguised state universities in California and England serve as the temporary homes for our heroes, professors Zapp and Swallow. The former well-respected, well-paid and well-fed, the latter just tryig to hang on. Their exchange experiences mirror one another in many respects, and soon the left-behind wives and children are part of their new lives. Lodge uses letters, news articles, narrative and a movie script to shine the spotlight on academe. Clever twists and observations on the times make this a fast, fun read.	2001-08-15

This work is derivative of Nelson DeMille, who did a better, if even darker, job with much of the same theme in &quot;Spencerville&quot;, which is probably DeMille's weakest effort to date.<br />Basic plot: Wounded &quot;hero&quot;, returns to the immediately apparent pettiness of his small town roots. He's full of self-doubt and self-pity. The town bullies from high school are still there. And the usual accessories: Pick up trucks, grain dust, steroids, lost love, the good-hearted sheriff, beautiful, enabling and abused women, divorce, gangbangers moving in from the big city, and physical threats.

Try any of the other eighty three, as this one is not worth reading. As two other reviewers note, scant attention is paid to the battle at Sharpsburg/Antietam. Rather, Reasoner uses this title as suberfuge to take the reader riding all over Virginia from March to September 1862. Even the dust cover is misleading. Twelve pages of over 350 have anything to do with this battle, which is grossly oversimplified and underdescribed.<br />Reasoner seems intent solely on telling one chapter of an eight-part life of the Bannon family, a cliched and boring Southern family if there ever was one. The plot is plodding, the characters are stereotypes. Even with an accurate title, there would be little here worth reading. The editor and publisher should be ashamed.<br />And one more thing: Although this is a novel, the reader deserves at least a map of Virginia with each of the numerous towns and battles mentioned in the book shown on the map. Unless you know Virginia geography intimately, you'll be more lost than some of the commanders who, as Reasoner notes, suffered from poor maps. He doesn't offer any assistance. Better yet, some of the larger engagements merit detailed battle plans. One map would be worth five thousand words.<br />My only consolation is that I borrowed this from the public library. And, in this case, my Amazon recommendations were way off the mark.	2001-08-11

It is a more complete and touching work about coming of age in northern New Jersey. Reinken can be very descriptive and detailed with his words; small acts become profound.<br />Anthony Rubin -- self-admittedly the only Jew named &quot;Anthony&quot; he knows of -- is the hockey star son of confused parents: a mother who abandons the family to dive in Florida and a father whose affair drove Anthony's mother to move away. Anthony struggles without his mother but finds solace first with his hockey team manager (motherly Alex) and then with his next door &quot;Mafia&quot; (so everyone seens to believe, wrongfully) crush, Juliette. His fascination with older girls (two years older in high school still leaves them as older girls, not women) does not seem to stem from his search for maternal love now absent from his life, but from high school hormones working overtime.<br />Reiken threads Anthony's coming of age around hockey, family separation, and a big sister. He loses one of his crushes but gains some insights. Reinken does not leave any neat endings, although this conclusion is clearer and more satisfying than &quot;The odd sea&quot;.<br />There is a lot of over-the-top but hardly explicit high school sex. It struck me as more overdone than credible. Juliette is drawn and more attached to a bad boy, football jock jerk while maintaining her secret affair with the younger Anthony. She sticks with the high school drunken stud type who always confounded the nice guys who can't understand this self-abusive female behavior. <br />&quot;Lost legends&quot; would likely appeal to those with sentimental attachments to urban angst and readers will find similar themes in Kaplan's &quot;Two guys from Verona&quot; and Russo's &quot;Empire falls&quot;, both of which score a bit higher in my ledger.	2001-08-10

And the film version showed the story, even if it was the Hollywood version. &quot;Flags&quot; is a compelling story of one of the men who won the battle of Iowa Jima and then went home -- very quietly -- to live out his life. Only his death allowed his children to read and understand the magnitude of what he and other war veterans achieved, the many veterans who did their job against horrendous odds and then moved on with their lives, with only their nightmares and private, silent, secrets to haunt them for the rest of their lives. They would not, or could not, speak about their experiences. And for good reason.<br />James Bradley delves into the story his father never told while he was alive, the story of unimagined terror on a tiny island, fighting a most savage, unforgiving and unsurrendering enemy. His father saw atrocities no one deserves to see. And, after all this, he led a quiet, unassuming life in Wisconsin after the war, returning to his roots and putting the war behind him as best he could. The son's pursuit of the full story results in perhaps the greatest tribute a son can offer, a glowing, sobering, startling story honoring a deceased father and his comrades. James Bradley's dad was a hero who knew that the real heroes didn't come off Iwo alive. He honored the dead comrades with a deep, unspoken respect.<br />Tom Brokaw's &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; is the more popular and publicized version of these war veterans and their unrewarded heroics but his casual treatment of these great men can't come anywhere close to &quot;Flags&quot;.

In 1900, Buffalo was the gem of the Great Lakes, a booming industrial power, the home of recent president Grover Cleveland, and host to the great Pan American exposition. Niagara Falls electricity created a new future for industry and home life, but not without its conflicts and environmental concerns.<br />Belfer creates Louisa, a fictional schoolmistress at a pretigious private girls' academy (based loosely on Buffalo Seminary), whose life becomes wrapped up in the electrical revolution. And Louisa has a secret, in fact several secrets. And along with the tragedy of the failed exposition and the assassination of President McKinley, suffers personal tragedies of her own.<br />This is a &quot;woman's&quot; book, written by a woman, with a woman as the central character abnd voice of the novel. Yet even hardended readers of &quot;male&quot; novels will generally enjoy the history and intrigue.	2001-08-07

The problem is not a simple one, and certainly not a simple conflict between undergraduate teaching and televised football and basketball at major research universities. Honors programs at mammoth schools may offer small classes, but its unlikely that they'll solve the problem either.<br />While the anecdotes are colorful and disturbing, Sperber's research is flawed by the manner in which he collects and reports data. Passing out surveys in his class and posting a questionnaire on a web site do not produce representative, meaningful numbers or conclusions, although he draws repeated inferences. It is not at all obvious that the demise of big-time athletics would restore excellence to undergraduate teaching and, if he looked harder, he'd find that some honors programs provide little rigor. And I doubt some of the faculty would be up to the rigors of teaching four or five classes of demanding students. Sperber's best conclusion is the &quot;don't bother me and I won't bother you&quot; truce between partying students and uninvolved faculty. Faculty can make a difference, but they have to first put in the effort. And paying &quot;student&quot; athletes is not the solution; it would make things worse. Parents and students have surrendered their responsibilites to EARN an education. What did they think they were getting when they enrolled? Are parents and students that rich and that dumb that they don't care? don't ask? don't know?<br />Universities are no longer the refined temples of wisdom Sperber remembers. As millions of students poured into universities and they became big business -- they have replaced steel mills as the factories of our age, &quot;knowledge factories&quot; -- and marketing and mass production were sure to follow. All we need are some discerning customers.	2001-08-05

Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.<br />Higgins has done some first-rate work.

Comanche Moon has all the expectations of Jurassic Park III -- after the first creative burst, it's a tough act to follow; by the third part of the trilogy (second in the chronology of the protagonists), the author has set a definitive tone and built an adoring audience. &quot;Moon&quot; carries on in the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; tradition, but with some apparent errors in chronology, excessive torture details, and little of the humor of the original.<br />The color of Texas is there. The struggle to live. The demise of the Indian culture and population. Honor, venegance and tradition. The details of the dreary topography. The eccentricities that must have accompanied many of those who tested this rugged life. There's a vivid portrait of a morbid time of war, Indian raids, and rapes.<br />Having immensely enjoyed the original &quot;Dove&quot; book and miniseries and having a less glowing memory of the follw up, picking&quot;Moon&quot; up at the public library, I was expecting a long, rich read. McMurtry kept me engaged through the 700+ pages. But I finished with a deep sense of disappointment. For the same reason I've stopped reading the repetitive themes of Tom Clancy and John Grisham, I doubt I'll try McMurtry again.	2001-07-22

Russo's previous triumph -- Straight Man -- made me receptive to his next work, and he did it again. Empire Falls beguiled me and drew me into an intricate web.<br />While this is fiction, Russo has a method for intricate detail, small asides, and colorfully connected characters, coloring each with a clear sense of reality. Miles Roby has an understandably difficult life to manage: a disappointed soon-to-be ex-wife, a beautiful mother dying young, a struggling diner in failing blue-collar northern city, a troubled teenaged daughter, and several old nemeses he simply can't shake in this small, decaying town.<br />And the middle-aged fears and doubts Russo portrays reminded me of my own mortality and the value of family and friends. Like Will and Joel in James Kaplan's Tw Guys from Verona, Miles and David Roby share some dark secrets and common struggles, not as supermen or masters of the universe, but as likeable if crippled protagonists. And Russo has the talent to remember the pettiness and pain of high school life as well. After reading this, you want to hug your children, call your retired parents, and make better contact with your friends. Humanity triumphs.	2001-07-08

The trials and tribulations of the very different yet long-term friends, Joel and Will, are colorful, realistic and oh so painful to someone of the same era.<br />Kaplan has an indirect, poetic flourish. He notes and vividly describes colors, sounds and smells. These visceral aspects of his style complement and round out the development of characters and scenes. At times the non-linear exposition and delayed description of characters can be frustrating, but it is worth the wait. These are characters worth discovering.<br />Who hasn't left behind some deep-seated memories, ones you'd just as soon avoid as pursue? What middle-aged male has not looked twice at younger women? And what same male has not anguished over lost hair, an expanded waistline, a looming mortgages, and or spousal distance? Well-worn subjects brought to life by a skilled author.	2001-07-06

The world witnessed the decline of docile, gentle student behavior, managed by old white men in tweed coats. Students found new, forceful ways to express themselves, and opened an era of campus struggles.<br />Downs demonstrates that students know enough to know they don't want to learn some of the things that there teachers are teaching, yet they are also young and naive enough to stumble about agressively and sometimes irrationally for a solution. And the senior professors, save a few stalwarts, had no capacity to deal with this new breed of students.<br />Based on Cornell's desire to &quot;do good&quot;, to promote social justice, to provide meaningful educational opportunities, and to add diversity (before there was such a common, abused term on American campuses), the Trustees approved a plan to enroll disenfranchised students from urban areas at their bucolic campus. Cornell was Ivy League, yes, but more rural than sophisticated, more agricultural than urbane. Cornell was to provide a strange environment for a noble experiment. Did it work? After the takeover of the administration building by armed students, most Americans never looked at university education the same way again.<br />Meticulous archival research of previously unsurfaced or unpublished records brings life and details to a college's uncomfortable history.	2001-06-06

So many things could go wrong, and that was before there was long-range fighter protection. Just surviving the trip to the target could be a miracle.<br />Discipline and training matter. Commitment to the cause matters more. Courage helps, but it's not enough. This book understands the small, human parts that go into a large, heroic effort.	2001-06-06

At least this life merits some good laughs in the hands of a clever author.<br />As a professor myself and a fan of the academic genre, I chuckled straight through Russo's fast, delightful read of &quot;Straight Man&quot; and quickly passed the book along to my provost, and English professor himself. This is the story of a college professor on the edge, sliding quickly down a slippery slope and compounding his troubles with solutions that only beget more problems. An apt portrait, both sad and funny, Russo has a real feel for college life and the inane aspects of the academy. A very pleasant read.	2001-05-29

And, to be fair, I agree with most of the conclusions. However, Laura Schlessinger has the bad luck to blend the acerbic style of Ann Robinson (&quot;The weakest link&quot;) into a subject that requires the most compassionate understanding of one of life's greatest emotional challenges, i.e., child rearing. There is too much lecturing, off-the-cuff examples of obviously bad and irrational parenting, and simple overkill. The good news and important lessons are lost in the rhetoric. The world certainly needs better parents and families. More traditional methods of family formation and parenting have grown out of fashion and need a clear, fresh, positive re-examination. As much as its needed, I doubt this book will become the manual for many of those (prospective) parents.	2001-05-29

He attends to the historic question: Why are some nations so rich and others so poor?<br />Geography matters, e.g., cold weather countries do economically better than tropical. Climate matters, e.g.,moderate climates are better for growth than are extreme climates. Technology matters e.g., eyeglasses added years to the productive work of skilled crafstment hundrds of years ago. Most of all, culture matters. Landes indirectly yet quite adroitly shows that diversity in all its forms is a resource and that nations benefit from diversity and their other resources in matters of economic and human development if -- perhaps only if -- that nation forges consensus around common values: political and economic freedom; private property and the rule of law; a system of progression and success through merit; and education, training and entrepreneurship.<br />The anecdotes are plentiful. The data are useful. The scope of the work is incredible. The message is clear and well made. Sure, the most politically correct skeptics will carp. But the world still has not yet witnessed a major economic power between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. A small portion of the world's population produces an abundance of the globe's wealth (and, yes, of course, consumes much of what it makes). And the link between political freedom (and its correlates) and economic growth is very clear. Tyranny eventually fails. Technology will eventually be adopted and exploited.<br />A nation's common, progressive, evolving, empowering culture provides the template for economic development and success. Full marks, professor.	2001-05-29

Ambrose's band of brothers -- the 506th Regiment -- illustrates the success of the common citizen soldier model, drawn from all walks of life, committed to a common ideal, and forged into a unit technically proficient and even more committed to one another. These men loved one another more than they loved life itself, and they made the supreme sacrifice in the name of brotherhood.<br />The story is riveting and tense. Ambrose weaves a great story. He knows soldiering, if only as a historian. He takes you from basic training for the 101st in 1942, through (...)Army procedures, to embarking for Europe, where these men learned that leadership is critical and that it can be measured where it matters most (in the battlefield), as well as in the day-to-day actions of superiors devoted to leading citizen soldiers.<br />One can only marvel at the preparation and courage required to launch an airborne invasion of Europe. For Ambrose's heroes, two years of training led them to one year of fighting across western Europe. Normandy, Market Garden (\\"A bridge too far\\"), the Bulge.<br />Sometimes the leadership isn't immediately apparent. One (...)leader, despised by the men for years, earns their begrudging respect years later, even after an attempted mutiny and a conspiracy to frag (him). And even the softer, comical side of soldiering emerges. The brothers are all human. They make mistakes. They loot. They act on impulse. Yet the closing comment from one of the brothers to his grandson explains it best: \\"I wasn't a hero in the war, but I fought with a lot of them.\\"<br />I can't wait for the HBO mini-series.	2001-05-29

No, not the Hollywood or other media images of conspicuous consumption, ostentatious displays or gauche noveau riches, but rather the simple, tried and true model of living within your means, staying the course, and valuing wealth accumulation over conspicuous consumption.<br />For those who wan to be wealthy, this is a much better road map than most if not all of the get-rich schemes that seem to better enhance the income of the author of the scheme than it does the wealth of his or her followers (or victims). In fact, Stanley and Danko publish the &quot;secrets of wealth&quot; and ask for nothing in return, proving the adage that a good idea has infinite value.<br />My students, like many people, regularly confuse income with wealth and mistake consumption as an indicator of wealth. Danko and Stanley show otherwise. Like the classic work, &quot;The richest man in Babylon&quot;, the authors study the profile of successful wealth gainers and show how you can do it, with hard work and discipline.	2001-05-29

And, to be candid, I read it straight through the day I received it.<br />Sides weaves American Caesar Douglas MacArthur's departure, the 1942 fall of Bataan, and the prisoners' three-year aftermath into the effort by untested Rangers to rescue the POWs in late January 1945, when only 500 sickly men survived in an old camp north of Manila. In some respects, these POWs were the lucky ones, even as they lost hope in a rescue thirty-three months in the offing. Moving back and forth between prison life and the rescue effort, Sides builds the story well. The joy of rescue mingles with the possiblity of a last-minute massacre.<br />The Japanese treatment of American POWs in WWII holds a special place of horror in the minds of Americans of &quot;the greatest generation&quot;, and this book makes the terror real. At the same time, the Japanese are not all portrayed as monsters or torturers. In fact, it's the humanity amidst the stark terror and misery that surfaces in this book, the small acts of kindness, the apparently random administration of mercy, and the kindred spirit of POWs.<br />The Ranger rescue demonstrates American soldiering at its best, at a time when wounds about actions in Vietnam not only remain, they have recently resurfaced. Sides makes it clear war is based on hate and horror but honor as well. More students of history need to read and know this story, somewhat forgotten or overlooked in the magnitude of events that followed: V-E Day, Hiroshima, V-J Day.<br />The book falls a bit in its narrative. I felt like this was destined if not designed to be a magazine or a movie treatment more than an historic analysis. Despite meticulous attention to tracking down details, Sides' writing left me feeling a bit flat, unconnected to the key figures. Sure, I cried at the end. I was moved by the heroism and commitment of the Rangers. But I thirsted for more, even knowing that reconstructing events is difficult fifty-plus years out.<br />The veterans of this rescue deserve the accolades. They deserve your reading this book.	2001-05-16

This is not a book about the business of business schools. It is a look at full-time MBA and executive (MBA) programs at the arguably best business schools in the world. This is like saying this is a study of the auto  industry when all you have studied is Mercedes Benz. The real  &quot;business&quot; of business schools must cover the part-time and  undergraduate programs.<br />The authors bash b-schools for promoting a cult  of gurus, only the authors also promote and quote gurus at every turn. And  they use the same gurus to criticize the very schools that hire and promote  them. The authors decry one-liners, only to close their work with a cliched  one-liner of their own (&quot;management is pocket science, not rocket  science.&quot;). The authors tell b-schools to be customer-friendly but not  to cater to the catering needs or accommodation interests of their clients.  The authors purport to do a global study when this is at best a modest  revision of a study of the elite European business schools. They imply (p.  186) that the AACSB only changed its name to International Association of  Management Education outside the U.S., and this is not true. They criticize  business deans for lacking vision, while not realizing that the  &quot;independent subcontractor&quot; mode of business faculty is  inconsistent with &quot;academic leadership&quot; creating a vision for  such independent experts.<br />Business schools have been successful because  they produce what businesses clearly prefer to hire: knowledge workers,  managers and leaders for the global economy. Business students at all  levels -- undergraduate, graduate and executive -- are learning the new  culture and language of the new world economy. If b-schools were not the  cash cows for universities that universities make them to be, or if as much  were spent on training top business students as is spent on the college's  star quarterback, we might have even more effective business schools. The  fact that innovation and leadership is absent from the &quot;top&quot;  schools is a phenomenon in all industries: the top schools become rich and  self-satisfied and the real change bubbles up from those struggling,  niche-building programs competing for the new customers' dollar. A  well-trained manager may not be a rocket scientist, but if there are design  flaws in his education, Challenger-like disasters are in the making.  Business education is too big and too important to be left to a few, smug,  incredibly expensive schools. And we should all be grateful that it is  not...	1999-10-03

The dust cover picture of armed students leaving Cornell's Straight Hall in April 1969 tells a story close to my heart in time and geography. Downs' wonderful study of student power shows the inevitable problems that emerged  when well-intentioned university liberals surrendered their fundamental  academic principles in the name of compassion. Downs illustrates the  unintended consequences of affirmative action, from students who did not  want so much to learn from the institution...they wanted to radically  change the institution.<br />The students understood politics, public  relations and the power of the &quot;big lie&quot;. While they may not have  been competent to lead Cornell through needed change, Downs makes it clear  that neither was the Cornell administration ready or able to manage  change.<br />Once the violent takeover began, what little control President  Perkins had was lost. The subsequent finger-pointing and resignations were  unavoidable. Yet questions remain: Was it institutional racism fostered by  a priest or political correctness that set off the furor? Who burned the  cross in front of the African-American residence hall? Did the  administration have a hand in the fraternity &quot;counterattack&quot; on  Straight? Was this a spontaneous act out of frustration by African-American  students or an SDS plot to radically reform Cornell? After it was over, did  Cornell learn any lessons?<br />I could not put it down. A must read for baby  boomers, especially those intent on understanding events that formed the  ideology of those in the White House today.	1999-06-02
