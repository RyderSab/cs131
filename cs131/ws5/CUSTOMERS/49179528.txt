It turns out that this so-called &quot;friendliest cast ever&quot; had many axes to grind. For example, almost everyone in the house disliked Jamie enormously-- and Danny and Kelley hated him most of all. Melissa and Kelley had a greater rivalry than we saw onscreen. And it goes on and on.<br />This book will seem refreshing to viewers who thought that RW-New Orleans was too upbeat.	2001-02-02

This comprises the largest section of the book, and for those who aren't interested in geography and topography, it will be a boring read.<br />The section that most readers would be interested in is the section about the contestants of Survivor 2. Unfortunately, the material included here is hardly more extensive than the stuff you can read in magazine articles (and magazine articles cost less, might I add). The &quot;psychological profiles&quot; are hardly more than blurbs, and frankly, one doesn't need to be a psychologist to have given the same assessments of the contestants. Any person who has watched the first episode or two could've come up with the same &quot;profiles.&quot;<br />All in all, I'd say it's worth checking out from the library or for browsing through while at your local bookstore, but this isn't one that you need to have in your home library-- unless you're hoping it'll be worth something as a collector's item. Maybe the complete, post-show Survivor 2 book will be better.	2001-02-02

Now that I've read it years later, I'm regretful that this stunning memoir wasn't a part of my consciousness when I was younger.<br />This is a story of racial dissonance-- and how horrifying it is to see the lengths that whites would go to to abuse and humiliate emancipated blacks!-- but it is also a story of a brilliant young man whose voice crosses racial bounds. I could identify with him completely, and I have little patience with those reviewers who've described him as &quot;whiny&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;hateful.&quot; I know what it feels like to grow up in a rural town and have people try to break you for having aspirations. I know what it's like to &quot;feel and cultivate feelings&quot; while others strive for &quot;the trivial material prizes of American life,&quot; and I know that justifiable distrustfulness and resentment are not to be confused with hate.Most importantly, I know what it feels like to try to escape one's oppressive roots. The pain in this story was so real for me that I cried my way through many, many passages.<br />&quot;Black Boy&quot; should come as a revelation to black persons, white persons (like myself), and anyone who has ever hungered for their life to mean something more.	2000-12-12

It seems to be yet another &quot;poor little rich girl gazing at her navel&quot; story, and the writing, while competent, is certainly unexceptional.

In my opinion, this book (along with Laura's Luck and Amy and Laura) is a children's classic, so why it is no longer in print is a mystery to me. I read this when I was in grade school in the 1970s and I found it wonderfully exotic. Imagine going to the convenience store to get penny candy and long pretzels out of a barrel! Imagine having a mother who looks like Joan Crawford (and this is considered a compliment!). The depiction of the Bronx during wartime is absolutely charming-- it's not the rough, slighlty seedy Bronx that one thinks of today.<br />I think publishers have a tendency to remove books from print if they feel that the subject matter is dated. (I notice that the All of a Kind Family series is out of print, too!). This is a huge mistake. I grew up with a tremendous respect for and interest in the past as a result of reading &quot;old&quot; books as a kid-- I was always much more interested in reading about &quot;yesterday,&quot; and I think I had better manners as a result of my reading! I'm sorry to think that today's kids might not be able to take the same joy in the bygone days as I did.	2000-11-29

On the one hand, I thought it was a tautly written and naturally compelling story-- one whose facts were so gripping that O'Nan had a lot of his work done for him already. On the other hand, I can't remember the last time I cried so much when reading a book. The thought of adults trampling over women and children and leaving them huddled on the floor to burn to death is horrific. The ordeal experienced by both victors and survivors is so painstakingly recounted that those who are faint of heart will hardly be able to bear the pain. And, as if that's not enough, there are some truly grisly descriptions of what the bodies recovered from inside the tent looked like. At this point in the book, I wondered if O'Nan was really as &quot;humane&quot; as other reviewers have made him out to be, although I confess that I kept reading.<br />There are some details in this book that redeem its exploitativeness somewhat. The stories of the heroes-- both those who lost their lives in the fire and the police officers and detectives who kept case files open for years afterwards-- lend depth and hope to &quot;The Circus Fire.&quot; But to imagine all of those children who lost their parents, or parents who lost their children, left me sleepless for nights after reading this book. I don't know if something so disturbing warrants a full 5 stars, so I'm going to give this four stars and one warning bell (for the reader whose sensibilities are as delicate as mine).	2000-11-16

Even though &quot;Fifteen&quot; was written in the 1950's, its themes of a girl longing for romance and feeling awkward about herself are timeless and relatable issues today. Some reviewers have commented that the book is too dated for teens because it doesn't deal with such current subjects as sexual pressures, etc. In my case, however, &quot;Fifteen&quot; defined perfect love. And since I read it when I was so young, I spent my teens waiting for someone who was as worthy of my affections, a guy as worthy as Stan was for Jane. I would recommend this book to girls under the age of 12 in hopes that it will give them an alternate view of what real romance is all about.	2000-10-18

It seems kind of extreme that a character should have to die in  order to drive home a simple point about respect to these kids. Mr. Pignati  is turned into a victim for the sake of making a heavy-handed point, and I  hate that sort of thing.<br />Zindel, however, is a unique writer, and I wish  kids and teachers would focus on &quot;Pardon Me, You're Stepping On My  Eyeball&quot; instead.	2000-09-14

In some ways I admired this book, especially the author's thoughtful,  facile writing style-- but I had a bit of trouble with the overall premise.  Quite frankly, I never got a real sense that Ms. Wilensky suffered greatly  as a result of her Tourette's syndrome and OCD. Most of the stories she  shares about adolescent and parental alienation are typical of any young  girl; they are not unique to her afflictions, which reduces the impact and  credibility of the book as a &quot;memoir of compulsion.&quot; Although it  sounds almost heartless to ask of the author, &quot;What are you  complaining about?&quot;, that was the question that perpetually ran  through my mind as I read this book. I experienced far more grievous  psychological troubles in my youth and adulthood, yet I don't feel that I'm  special or &quot;deserve&quot; to have my memoir read on account of what  I've endured; I wonder why Ms. Wilensky felt her story needed to be  told.<br />I do, however, want to credit Ms. Wilensky for her honesty-- I  believe she was honest throughout the book, sometimes painfully so-- and  for her obvious writing talent.	2000-08-15

In a way,  though, I wish the series had ended with the wonderful &quot;These Happy  Golden Years.&quot; I don't believe that Ms. Wilder would've been pleased  to know that The First Four Years was published in such a rough, unpolished  state; it lacks the warmth and humor and careful attention to detail of her  earlier books. Comparatively speaking, it seems rushed and detached, and  the overall effect is a little depressing. The reader knows that she shared  a happy life overall with her husband Almanzo Wilder, because the two were  inseperable until both died in their 90's. But we never get to see the  affection between the two of them, or the lighter moments. I don't doubt  that the grim events depicted in this book were really true, but it is  unlike Laura not to make the best of them, and this book seems more like a  lament than a celebration.	2000-08-08

I read this book when I was in grade school, and thought that it was just  the most thrilling thing I'd ever read; even though Laura and Almanzo's  relationship is described modestly and subtly, it got my heart thumping. I  had the pleasure of rereading &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;  recently, and even now, a married woman myself, the book still exhilerates  me and captures my imagination. In some children's series, it is sad to see  the heroine grow into a woman, but in Laura's case, her stories become even  more interesting as she crosses the bridge from youth to adulthood. She and  Almanzo were a strong and exceptional couple whose courtship should be an  inspiration to everyone. I'm glad that, if the series had to end, Ms.  Wilder ended it on such a satisfying note.	2000-08-08

Louise Fitzhugh was capable of producing highly literary characters in the guise of children's fiction; to  those parents who've complained that the book is &quot;too dark&quot; and  &quot;too negative,&quot; well, some might say the same of Dostoyevski or  Balzac. Life ain't all roses and sunshine, people! This book is a brilliant  and ripping satire on the affluent life of New York's Upper East Siders,  with whom I am quite familiar, as well as on the skewed parental values of  the 1970's. It is also a book about a little girl who suffers for her art,  which every budding artist and antiheroine will relate to on several  levels. Enjoy this book, and steer clear the dreadful, treacle-y film at  all costs!	2000-08-01

It  bothered me a great deal, and I developed a paranoia that I would contract  (or had already contracted) leukemia myself. I think it's important that  children who are fearful of death do not read this one without supervision  and feedback.<br />One nice thing about the book: It introduced me to the fine  poet Gerald Manley Hopkins, author of &quot;To Spring&quot;  (&quot;Margaret, are you grieving/ over goldengrove unleaving?&quot;).

Tartt, who is  evidently well-read herself, provides no shortage of fascinating allusions  throughout this suspenseful work. Some critics have accused her of  ostentatiously cramming everything she learned from her liberal arts  education into one volume, but I think this literate approach is  appropriate for the book, given its subject matter and the nature of its  characters.<br />As I reread the book, I see that it is not flawless. Tartt  tends to repeat herself, and her editor should have been vigilant over  this. (For example, in one early scene, Henry tells Richard that Bunny's  family &quot;doesn't have a cent,&quot; and Richard is surprised. About a  hundred pages later, Henry tells him this again, and Richard again seems  surprised, saying he thought they were bluebloods. The book is rife with  little redundancies of this kind.) Secondly, Tartt often lacks a tight  wrap-up before her space breaks, and the dramatic pauses often fizzle out.  There are also moments where Tartt, normally so lavish with her  descriptions, &quot;holds out&quot; on the reader-- for example, when Henry  (in regards to the Bacchanal) says that &quot;there was a certain carnal  element to the proceedings,&quot; and we never find out exactly what this  &quot;certain element&quot; was, it strikes this reader as being an evasive  cheat. And then there is Bunny's notorious letter to Julian, in which he  reveals all that he knows; I felt that the text of this letter needed to be  included in order for it to seem truly damning to the rest of the Greek  scholars. <br />I also think, arguably, that Tartt made a mistake in killing  off Bunny, who was one of the book's most singular characters. The story  flattens out and loses agreat deal of his charm after his demise. How she  could have approached the book differently is hard to say, but the second  half of &quot;The Secret History&quot; does suffer as a result of the  actions taken by the surviving characters.<br />Aside from all that, &quot;The  Secret History&quot; is a marvelous tangled web of a book, and the author--  who composed this novel when she was in her 20's-- is one of our most  ambitious and promising scribes. I look forward to her new book, which I've  heard is to be titled &quot;Henry Darger,&quot; due out later in the year.	2000-08-01

Every girl in my junior high was carrying around dog-eared copies of it and enjoying the &quot;racy&quot; parts; I can remember being  in grade school and clustering in a circle with other little girls,  titillating each other by reading the sexual scenes aloud. It was the  equivalent of little boys sneaking a look at their dad's  &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines. There are no redeeming qualities to the  book; the writing isn't good, and there is no underlying message and no  character development to speak of. I suspect Blume wrote this one just to  make money. I would not recommend this book to anyone, least of all  pre-sexual girls, as it won't teach them anything about literature, and it  won't teach them anything very worthwhile about sex either.	2000-07-26

Most of my physicians don't understand why I'm alive today, as I was  close to death's door on many occasions, and have done lasting damage to my  body. In short, my battle with EDs is not necessarily better or worse than  Hornbacher's-- which might enable me to empathize with her, I  thought.<br />Not entirely so. While I recognized every one of Hornbacher's  &quot;tricks&quot; and mind games, and had implemented all of them (and a  few that she didn't mention!) myself, I still felt that her explanations  about the etiology of her disease were at times too pat. Anorexia/bulimia  isn't about having a svelte figure, and I don't believe it's about parental  neglect either-- nor is it about being a &quot;poor little rich (or  upper-middle-class) girl.&quot; Sure, Hornbacher ascribed other reasons for  her disorder-- a general psychic falling-out between the mind and the  body-- but I felt that the old cliches hovered over the story as a whole,  doing a disservice to women (like myself) who are not &quot;typical&quot;  victims of the disease.<br />I'm impressed that such a young writer could  sustain an autobiography/memoir this effectively, but I had trouble with  her authorial voice at times. Her tough defensiveness, interspersed with  self-pity (Look, I'm unflinching! Oops, now I'm flinching!) seemed abrasive  to me after a while. It's unfortunate to say that I didn't much like the  author, but unfortunately, when dealing with a memoir, the author's  personality does come under scrutiny, and affects the book in its  entirety-- and in &quot;Wasted,&quot; I think the effect is negative.  Hornbacher is no patron saint of eating disorders, nor is she particularly  representative of anything other than the usual bag of tricks, although she  is honest and does occasionally demonstrate a nice turn of phrase.	2000-07-21

Having endured 14 years as a bulimic/anorexic (recently recovered), I have found most fictional depictions of eating  disorders to be shallow efforts that feed into the fallacious cultural  stereotypes (the afflicted women are trying to revert to childhood; they  are getting revenge on an inadequate/inattentive parent; etc.). Rosen's  novel doesn't necessarily depart from some of these stereotypes-- its  eating disordered heroine, Ruth, is an upper middle class product of an  overbearing, narcissistic mother-- but its sensitivity and thoroughness is  remarkably admirable. Rosen has clearly done his homework regarding the  etiology of the disease, and there are stretches of writing which become a  bravura performance; Joseph's interaction with the charismatic Dr. Flek,  for example, and the way this leads to the revelation of Joseph's own  obssession, are accomplished with an almost 19th-century precision. My one  disappointment was Ruth, whose childlike neediness (alternated with thinly  veiled hostility) bothered me; I would have preferred a depiction of a  woman emotionally emancipated from her family and attempting to be stronger  for her own sake, yet still, tragically, failing. Nevertheless, I recommend  this book for all readers-- and especially those with a vested interest in  the psychopathology of eating disorders and those whom eating disorders  affect, both directly or peripherally.	2000-07-17

Mirvis is an  exceedingly earnest writer, and I want to root for her, but her prose lacks  artistic imagination.	2000-07-11
