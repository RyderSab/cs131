With a Ph.D and extensive training in the areas detailed by this book, I should have enjoyed the read more.  But the editor's choice of chapters did not lend to a good read.  The excerpts chosen fail to cohere.  And the excerpts here are not good representations of the authors' work.   <br /> <br />The table of contents made my mouth water:  Bourdieu, Strathern, Foucault, Dumont, Luhmann, Habermas, Lyotard, etc.  But the sum is far, far less than the sum of parts.  <br /> <br />The introduction isn't a great deal of help--one feels that this collection is more representative of Faubion's personal faves, and less a work designed to communicate to a greater audience.   <br /> <br />There are much better collections addressing the re-thought subject.  This is not the one to choose.  I'm afraid I just cannot recommend this collection to anyone.	2005-01-18

The text is sharp and clear and reads at a very fast clip.<br /><br />Throughout, Kromer feels a sense of burning injustice.  He is deeply upset by class inequality--at wealth in the face of poverty, at gluttony in the face of starvation.  His character is tormented by unfairness to the point that he would consider robbing a bank.  Through his prism of hunger, the world is divided into haves and have-nots, and the haves are divided into those who are decent enough to help and those who are cold and mean.<br /><br />Description is Kromer's main bag here and he does it well.  Cold winds, ratty clothes, women prostituting themselves for a meal--it feels immediate and real.  These are the words of someone who has been there.<br /><br />I would recommend the book strongly, particularly to young and remedial readers.  The prose is so honest and basic that this book could be easily mastered by kids in junior high school.  Struggling readers in community college, prison, and 4 year universities would also enjoy this gripping portrayal of poverty in America.  For more mature readers, the book is still rewarding, although lacking some sort of direction or greater authorship.	2004-12-09

Relevant to artists, scholars, scientists	Shekerjian tackles a tough topic and succeeds in bringing it down to earth.  \\"Geniuses,\\" or MacArthur Fellows, at any rate, are humanized here.  They aren't struck by lightning, or born with great discoveries.  They are hard workers and they have personality traits well-suited to creative endeavors.   <br /> <br />For a creative spirit such as myself, I was very intersted to glean insights from Shekerjian and from the MacArthur Fellows she spoke with.  By normalizing these people, Shekerjian shows (among other things) that a.) people of all kinds of backgrounds can produce \\"genius,\\" b.) \\"geniuses\\" work very hard, c. geniuses are capable of pursuing their interests in the face of criticism, defeat, and setbacks, d.) genius is fostered by play, by cross-pollination, by persistence, and by \\"doing,\\" e.) et cetera--there are many more insights in the book.  <br /> <br />Shekerjian's prose is easy to read and well-organized.  The reader doesn't have to work to figure out this book, and instead profits from the considerable work that the author put into translating \\"genius.\\"  She's done the legwork, had the conversations, and had to decipher what can seem like the ineffable.   <br /> <br />I'm glad I read the book.  I took home many lessons for my own creative work; lessons that will hopefully linger for a long while.  I recommend this book to artists, writers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and political activists.  Geniuses are more ordinary than we suspect and they have more to share than their creations--they can share with us the process of creation itself.	2004-12-09

Like Holden Caulfield in _Catcher in the Rye_, the protagonist Ray is upset by the petty concerns of the world.  He shares Holden's sense that people are phony and trite.      Holden is ultimately redeemed and humanitarian in spirit.   But Ray is a more postmodern character, one who is adrift and bitter.  As the novel progresses, Ray becomes darker.  He seems misguided at first, then suddenly belligerent and homicidal.  I was perplexed by this transition--it was an awkward and poorly executed part of the book.     While following Holden's path was rewarding in so many ways, Ray's route is just awful.  Although the first half of the novel--the jaded, misguided Ray--was a page-turning success, the second half spirals and sputters.  By the end I was glad to be done with Ray and with the novel.     For a much more rewarding descent into the beastly side of society, try Denis Johnson's [[ASIN:0060988827 Angels: A Novel]].  While _Oscar Caliber Gun_ is a nice try, _Angels_ is a masterpiece.	2004-12-09

My students feel overwhelmed with the macroeconomics--they are befuddled by Tabb's casual use of terms such as deflation, the World Bank, interest rates, and Shumpeterian growth.  Anyone lacking some background in macroeconomics might want to avoid this book--or at least have a good reference text in hand.  <br />But for those of us with some basic fluency in global capitalism and its financial mechanisms, Tabb's book is a rewarding and insightful adventure.  Though I have a Ph.D, I feel quite educated by Tabb in ways which I did not anticipate.  <br />What Tabb helped me to see is the sudden emergence of finance capitalism since the 1970s--that the global economy has undergone a fundamental shift in terms of shareholder domination, capital flight, multinational production and ownership, and political control.  Where large productive industries (cars, steel, etc.) once collaborated with Keynesian policies in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, they are suddenly unshackled, and have fully embraced neoliberal economics.<br />It is Tabb who has helped me to understand this more than any other: more than Giovanni Arrighi, David Harvey, Marjorie Kelly, Amy Chua, or the goodly field of \\"anti-globalization\\" scholars.  With Tabb in hand, I feel a deep comprehension of the new global economy; one which had really eluded me.  <br />Although Tabb is a leftist, I think that middlers and conservatives might benefit from *The Amoral Elephant* as well.  Of course, they'll be bothered by his slant, but hopefully enlightened about the emergence of finance capitalism since the 1970s.  For one thing, Tabb shows the serious risks which capitalism presents to itself.  Like billionaire George Soros, Tabb sees the paucity of regulation asa serious threat to capitalism, as it weakens societies, foments rebellion, and undercuts the ability of consumers to absorb growing output.  Even a Republican or a Tory could be alarmed by the specter of global recessions, violent insurgencies, and widespread poverty.  <br />Tabb's book is an excellent history of capitalist political economies in the twentieth century.  From railroads to microchips, Tabb takes the reader on a journey which spells out a post-World War II consensus (though he omits relevant discussion of  Cold War neo-colonialism, CIA fueled coups and wars, etc.): high-wage, socially liberal \\"Western\\" states, extracting wealth from the third world, and creating a somewhat mutually profitable alliance between labor and capital.  He then traces the emergence of neoliberalism, wherein labor around the world is suppressed and major stockowners are enriched, where capital surges in and out of booms, leaving horrendous busts in its wake. <br />No matter where you fall politically, you will benefit from Tabb's book, which shows the rise of a neoliberalism.  This juggernaut is rivaled only by a growing movement of critics around the world, from Seattle to Brazil to Mecca.  It is a shockingly new and powerful regime which affects the lives of most everyone on the planet.  Read Tabb's book, and decide how you feel about the prospects of democracy, wealth, and power in this new epoch.	2004-04-09

The photos are nice enough and it's appealing to think of all of the wildlife in one tiny little area.  But, in the end, the book amounts to a few snapshots of racoons, foxes, and macaques. <br />The one thing which redeems the book is its zen-like quality.  Rather than overwhelm you with staggering wildlife photos taken from a huge area, this book is modest, patient, and quiet.  This is not a \\"greatest hits\\" wildlife book, with close-ups of lion's teeth or with eagles snatching trout from a river.  It's the humble undertaking of one photographer in one small locale.  It is a local and plain undertaking, but one which evokes nature in its more everyday moments. <br />Still, when one considers the wealth of other nature books and animal photography available, this book pales by comparison.	2004-03-10

I think many of the preceding reviews provide insight on this book: the argument is a tough-sell, it relies on generalizations, and it doesn't get everything right.  However, I don't this book is meant to be a final statement, but rather the beginning.  Taken in that light, Florida's work has great importance for cities and governments as we try to lay the foundations for sustained prosperity and happiness in the USA.  <br />At a time when stadium boondoggles are soaking taxpayers around the country, Florida's book is urgently relevant.  The argument may need some work, but hey: entrepreneurs of all kinds tend to thrive in a diverse, artsy, weird, non-conformist environment.  Corporate welfare is not the answer (see Detroit), bike lanes and grunge music is (see Portland, OR).  <br />Wealth and happiness is ultimately created by people, not by giant corporations.  Devising a great place to live, where people have great parks, schools, arts, and freedoms is the best path to the well being of economies and citizens alike.	2004-02-20

In all my 30-something years of life, including my doctoral studies, I scarcely heard a critical word about Rome. I myself have traveled to Europe, where I witnessed the empire's architectural marvels.  I have lightly studied Roman politics, economics, and militarism, and yet never have I come across a work such as this.  In one fell swoop, Parenti shatters the spell of Roman perfection.  He illustrates a society deeply divided by class; one in which an oligarchy consistently fended off land reform, egalitarianism, and social welfare.  <br />Strangely, Parenti gives little attention to the subjects of Rome's far flung empire, save to say that they were taxed to supply riches for Roman aristocracy.  Instead, Parenti focuses on the political struggles of Rome and bears witness to brutal and bloody battles which helped to guarantee the privileges of the few at the expense of the many.  Along the way, Parenti shows that many scholars gullibly or willfully swallowed Roman propaganda--the biased history manufactured by Roman oligarchs and their flattering, well-paid scribes.  A snapshot emerges here of classicists who have traditionally (if not currently) celebrated Rome's savage aristocracy, hallucinated about its democracy, belittled its reformers, and rejoiced in its bloodthirsty imperialism. <br />Parenti might have added this: the usual critique of Rome is that it was, at times, debauched; that its elites were excessively fond of sex, including--gasp--homosexuality; that its elites engaged in orgies, drinking, binging and purging.  In other words, it is a critique that focuses on parties, rather than politics, empire, slavery, the subjugation of women, or the war on the poor. <br />Parenti is surely not the first to undermine Roman mythology, and he is surely not the most authoritative writer on the subject.  But Parenti is a good, clear writer who has written a book for the general audience.  One need not know Latin, Augustus, or Plutarch to read and enjoy this study.  I hope that students, scholars, and readers of all kinds will seize upon the provacative and enlightening ideas of this book.	2004-02-11

Softens and erases corporate crimes	This book held such promise in my hands: a quick historical examination of key corporate empires in the last few hundred years.  It might have been perfect for my Geography students.  But alas, the book is a sorry escapade into myth-making and historical amnesia. <br />_Empires of Profit_ manages to listen sympathetically to the views of corporations and colonizers (East India Company, Cecil Rhodes, Nike, United Fruit, Shell Oil, etc.), without hearing the voices of the dead and impoverished.  Read _Dying for Growth_, _The Divine Right of Capital_, or _People Before Profit_ for more balanced and careful examinations of capitalism.  <br />Can you imagine a book which tells the story of the East India Company without telling of violence, theft, famine, and racism?  If so, then you can imagine Litvin's book.  (See Mike Davis' _Late Victorian Holocausts_ for insight into British rule!)  And can you imagine telling about Shell Oil in Nigeria, as if Shell was a gentle, but somewhat misguided bystander?  If so, welcome to Litvin's world, where corporations have an almost passive role in colonialism, neo-colonialism, politics, and militarism.  <br />This book is historically inaccurate, deaf to voices from abroad, and forgetful of horrifying encounters between multi-xillion dollar corporations and the poor countries they encounter.	2003-12-01

So shows Jacobson, in his wonderful book, _Barbarian Virtues_.  <BR>Vile racial hatreds define these hegemonic notions of &quot;civilization.&quot;  Jacobson's extensive research shows persistent and everyday racism operating in the daily discourse of American power.  Presidents McKinley and (Teddy) Roosevelt, as well as major newspapers and magazines, spew a stream of racism, and show it as a basic part of elite common sense at the time. <br />I want to second the reviewer from Durham, who found this book short on Blackness.  (Jacobson's excellent _Whiteness of a Different Color_ helps somewhat.)  One might add that this book only skims over the important experience of the violent conquest of the West and the Indians, in shaping &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; during these years.  (Drinnon's _Facing West: The Metaphysics of Indian-Hating and Empire Building is a larger and longer contribution in this regard.)  <br />The book could be faulted for lingering on the Tarzan novels, for example, when more pressing political issues ruled the day.  And I was hungry for a more sustained discussion of the colonization of the Philippines.  <br />But Jacobson is in pursuit of &quot;civilized&quot; ideas in everyday American thought--that's his safari here and, as such, he pursues his subject with great talent.  _Barbarian Virtues_ is a fast and gripping read.  And it exposes what school textbooks and the mass media forget so well: America has a long and viscious history of racial hatred.  When our politicians today speak of &quot;civilization,&quot; we ought to remember its deep, poisonous roots, and its longstanding use to justify the most brutal exertions of capitalist greed.	2003-11-30

In the short span of 123 pages, Thomas Patterson delivers a stunning and succinct overview of \\"Western civilization\\" and its encounters with \\"savages,\\" different \\"races,\\" and the Other.  He recounts briefly yet movingly the Spanish onslaught of Native Americans, ancient Greek notions of barbarism, the British colonization of Ireland, and more.  <br />But Patterson only gives the briefest sketch of these meetings--he is more concerned with the ever-changing ideologies with which some Europeans justify the wholesale looting, enslavement, murder, and colonization of others around the globe.  He portrays conservative and liberal ideas, as well as racial and economic notions.  He sketches the involvement of science with racism and colonialism, and he brings to life the deeply classist and sexist hatreds of Europeans elites--hatreds which easily translated into colonialism (inferiors and feminine types around the world \\"needed\\" to be ruled).   <br />Remarkably, Patterson manages to find space for critiques of \\"civilization,\\" both from within European societies and from those they encountered.  In this way agency is not restricted to a few rich, White Europeans, and the dialogue is constant and contested.  <br />I assigned this book to my upper division college students, and they comprehended and thrived on this book.  It is quick, clear, and powerful--truly a marvelous contribution.  I will surely assign it again.  Highest recommendation!	2003-11-30

He believes that \\"free trade\\" will cure every problem in the world.  And he believes that a lack of \\"free trade\\" is to blame for wars, poverty, and all other ills of humankind.  Unfortunately, Lindsey seems to possess a childish understanding of \\"free trade,\\" of world history, and of economics.  <br />To take just one flaw, in a book filled with flaws... Rather than carefully examine the wholesale gutting of Russia, when free trade fanatics took over (in the early 1990s), and when the Russian economic nearly collapsed, industrial output plunged, corruption and crime roared, prostitution exploded, AIDS and drug epidemics devoured the nation, poverty is up exponentially--and Lindsey can only say that they didn't go far enough! <br />Three billion humans live on less than a dollar a day--and while 45 million human beings face death from AIDS, Lindsey offers them only the market.  Most of them will die, while free marketeers talk of future salvation.  <br />One need only read Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz's Globalization and its Discontents for a far more intelligent overview of capitalism today.  Stiglitz, who is an ardent fan of capitalism, carefully disects the ways in which \\"free trade\\" is often anything but.  <br />The problem with free market lunatics like Lindsey is that they fail to see the ways in which powerful nations and corporations bully the marketplace, control politics, and stack the deck in their favor.  Just look at the cartels which control oil, fruit, cocoa, diamonds, automobiles, etc.  They control prices, laws, wages, and politics around the globe.  They profit from wars and from child labor.  It takes either a fool or a free market fantasy to miss these basic problems with unregulated \\"free trade.\\"  Like all fundamentalists, Lindsey needs less faith and fervor and more critical analysis.	2003-11-28

The writing is quite good--you can feel the dust and heat of Australia, as it works its way under your skin.  And you feel for the protagonist; you feel for a woman who has few options in life, and who's life is inevitably chained to one man or another.  <br />Although I'm very sympathetic to this position, I felt a little bit lost inside of this woman's mind, and felt that her men were caricatures, rather than developed characters.  I wanted to be a part of her thinking, but this bias in the writing threw me off. <br />In the end, after hundreds of pages and a bit too much saga, we are to rejoice that her chains have become easier.  It's a little hard to swallow.  I don't think this qualifies as a feminist work.

I consider myself fairly well educated: I have a Ph.D. and I've thrived on books in this genre, such as _Europe and the People Without History_ and _The Colonizer's Model of the World_.  But I find Arrighi's book a difficult one--a little beyond most readers, I should think.<br />There are three main reasons for this: a.) Arrighi fails to write for a larger audience and b.) fails to write as clearly as he could; and c.) Arrighi is assuming fluency in Braudel, Wallerstein, Abu-Lughod, and a host of other scholars who have tackled the rise of capitalist empires.  <br />I think most Americans, who have a mediocre background in Marxist theory, world systems theory, class dynamics, and hegemony, might want to pass.

Ultimately, I bogged down and could go no further. <br />This novel had great appeal for me--I'm not much of a \\"fantasy\\" genre reader, but this novel has enough urban-American sensibility to feel accesible to me.  It's almost \\"speculative\\" fiction, as Margaret Atwood calls it.  <br />I am deeply intrigued by this introduction to China Mieville, but I can't quite recommend this book to people outside of the traditional fantasy audience.	2003-06-24

I'm very sympathetic to Mr. Ali's position--he is an ardent critic of both Western imperialism and Islamic fanaticism.  However, Mr. Ali rushed this book into print, without the advent of good editing.  His lack of organization, and his reckless assertions deeply flaw what would otherwise be a valuable book.<br />Left in its current state, _The Clash of Fundamentalisms_ is rambling and fractured, bouncing from one topic to the next with little structure.  More disturbing are Ali's wild and unsubstantiated statements--such as his claims that the US deliberately shot down an Iranian airliner.  He often sounds like a conspiracy theorist because he makes this kind of assertion without presenting any evidence.<br />The book works better when Ali is documenting reckless Western behavior abroad.  For example, Ali recounts the US destruction of Egyptian labor movement and democracy, and the promotion of Islamic fascists there.  <br />All in all, Ali offers the reader some valuable background about the imperialism in the MiddleEast and many details in the rise of a peculiar kind of Islamic fundamentalism.  Ali shows how each of these fundamentalisms colluded with and fomented the rise of the other.	2003-03-13

This is a large book with an admirable variety of designs.  Especially handy for photocopying--for cutting and pasting the old fashioned way!  Great for zines, party invites, announcements, flyers, and so on.  <br />The book has a nice variety of designs from sports to animals to tech objects, and so on.  It's main drawback is that most of the designs are older ones.  So, for example--you can work with a funky old bicycle design, but nothing from a recent decade.  <br />Still, these designs completely spice up nearly anything you're working on.  I thought it was worth fifteen bucks.	2003-03-11

You feel transported to another time and consciousness--a late-feudal, early-modern Japan, where tradition and dogma perservere even as Japan is radically changing.

It in no way compares to his _Sweetness and Power_, which is a wonderful work. Instead, _Tasting Food_ offers some nice little essays. The title essay, on slave/creole cuisines of the Caribbean, is by far an away the best, and it is well worth reading. The other essays are just okay, or in the case of the last two (about national and American cuisines), quite bad. Nice, light reading as a complement to other anthropological writing about food.  Carole Counihan's edited volumes are better.	2002-12-09

Farquhar has written a very good book in Appetites.  Drawing from conversations, anecdotes, advertising, and--above all--novels, Farquhar is somehow able to convincingly trace a changing subjectivity in China.  Never grandiose in her claims, Farquahar addresses this fact: China is changing rapidly, and with its political and economic realignments Chinese personhood is changing too.  Careful never to construct a unified \\"Chinese\\" experience, the author instead describes mere footprints of an untrapable beast.  <br />She finds in China a subjectivity moving away from, but never forgetting, its histories of socialism and famine.  Indeed, eating is a practice through which such histories are thought about, reproduced, and critiqued.  Habits, memories, nostalgia, and modernity jostle for positions on contemporary Chinese platters.  <br />At times, the reader may long for more sustained evidence and thicker ethnography.  And yet such irritation is inevitably calmed by the author's soothing prose and gentle claims.  Unlike some of the medicine ads appearing in Appetites, the author never claims to be providing all of the answers to the body of China.  <br />Farquhar's reading of the changing personage of Lei Feng is striking.  She shows that this hero of the revolution has (at least partly) transformed from an image of self-sacrifice, duty, and community, to one now capable of hailing an individual consumer, who can define one's self-centered spending on health as ultimately beneficial to the group.  Indeed, the production of such individuality, Farquhar shows, has been necessary to make the segue into new sexual discourses.  <br />Farquhar shows that food, medicine, and sex can never be fully teased apart in China-indeed, they are often blended together so as to whet the appetites.	2002-11-21

The writing is crisp and pungent, like an autumn breeze, but the book just never quite blew strongly enough to fill my sails.    This book, creepy and macabre, is not a bad book.  However, it is a new genre for Doctorow, one that he has perhaps not yet mastered.  He said the book was written in honor of Edgar Allen Poe, his own father's favorite author.  Indeed, the spirit of Poe is present here.  Yet Doctorow never quite attains the dark transit of Poe.	2002-11-20

Rarely does one edited volume do such a good job of covering the essential essays about a topic.  Counihan and Van Esterik do just that in their well-wrought _Food and Culture_.  They skillfully offer food in an anthropological and historical perspective, giving attention to feminist, structuralist, semiotic, and other approaches.  The essays themselves are effectively trimmed down by the editors, and the resulting book is consistently rewarding. <br />The book is weak on vegetarianism, meat as meaning, post-structuralism, and fast food, and could use a bit of help on &quot;ethnic&quot; uses of food.  The addition of Doris Witt, Eric Schlosser, and Judith Farquhar would be helpful.  It also lacks Peter Singer's new classic, &quot;The Singer Solution to World Poverty.&quot;  A second edition with these modifications would be welcome!<br />This book can rival, supplant, or supplement most any professor's undergraduate reading packet on the anthropology of food.  Truly well-done.  Probably a staple meal on campuses for years to come.	2002-10-30

As an expectant dad I found this book easy to read and adequate.  It reviews the basics: your wife's changing mood, sex, labor, c-sections, etc.  If you're in the dark, this book will help lighten things up.<br />However, the book is written in an old-fashioned tone.  The pregnant woman is always referred to as either \\"your wife\\" or a \\"girl.\\"  Also, its expectations of fathers are quite low: be patient, don't sulk, be nice.  The message seems to be: \\"You're used to getting your way, but now you need to compromise just a bit.\\"  For a sexist guy, this book could be of some help, but for the sophisticated man Naomi Wolf's _Misconceptions_ is much better.	2002-10-17

The Beats were avant-garde in many ways, but they remained entrenched in sexism.  Sexual liberation is here frought with masculine privilege, as is drug-taking and the creation of art--men get to create, while the mothers cook, clean, and change diapers.  <br />However, I found the book a bit dull and unreflective.  Jones seems not to have been very excited by the Beat scene or the people whom she knew.  Nor does she emote a real feminist consciousness.  Instead, she seems to sense that something was wrong, and hope that things will change.	2002-10-17

It's short, easy to read, and hard-hitting.  Parenti explains in plain language why the American government is so despised around the world.  He shows that the U.S. kills civilians elsewhere on a regular basis (e.g. 30,000 in Nicaragua during the Reagan years, 2 million in Vietnam), but makes no apology for it.  He shows that the U.S. government cares about oil, money, and corporate profits far more than about global problems such as AIDS, hunger, or deforestation.  His chapter on Afghanistan is particularly helpful, especially when showing that Afghan women were doing very well before the U.S. supported the Taliban and Osama bin Laden and fueled a war which killed 1.5 million Afghans.  <br />As a college instructor, I will surely assign this to my students, who will enjoy debating Parenti's arguments.

I've heard it said that if there is a common theme in Crace's writing, it's that he sets his stage during times of social change.  Here, Crace brings us to a town about to lose its economic basis to technological innovation.  The author takes us into its Christian racism and its moral quandaries, even as the town lives in denial of its own doom.  Denial seems to operate the mind of the protagonist as well, and his own high-minded timidity hangs over the age as its defining quality.  Crace is an gifted writer, whose work offers the reader joy and lends insight into our contemporary geist.	2002-09-23

On the one hand we have a fascinating examination of humanity rebuilding, picking up its own shattered pieces and putting itself back together.  On the other hand, Johnson reminds us that The End of the World is, in many ways, both a collective and an individual experience.<br />One parralel (End of the-) World is the Fall of Saigon in 1975, for a refugee, Maria/Grandmother Wright.  Against her experience, the novel is hinged.  So too, Fiskadoro's coming of age ritual experience is also his own End of the World--the end of all that he once knew, and his rebirth as a new man. <br />In the end, Johnson asks us to reflect on memory and existence, and the subjectivity of life's great epochs.

There is a battle for the soul of the West--a gut-wrenching search for decency and humanity, pitted against the cruelest kind of marketplace.  <br />Naked power made manifest in patriarchy and White supremacy scour the novel, seeking out any who dare to challenge it; a 'free market' destroying and enslaving those who confront it.  <BR>I dream that this will be a epic mini-series one day.

In a quick and lively read, Hobsbawm takes the reader through anecdotes and ballads about &quot;social bandits,&quot; a la Robin Hood: bandits with a social conscience, or at least they are remembered that way.  <br />The global scale of such banditry is both interesting (seems like peasants everywhere celebrate the guy who steals from the rich to give to the poor), but ultimately thin. Are bandits generalizable from Brazil to China to the Balkans?  Hmmm.<br />Having read the original _Bandits_ and the new one, I can say that the revised edition is better, as it includes some nice discussion about the political economy of social banditry, and addresses other criticisms lodged by scholars over the years. Now we see bandits in light of power, class, and politics, which helps to make the book a more serious, though still lightweight, contribution to social theory.	2002-08-26

But the scholarship here is hackneyed and unprofessional.  His sources are scattered and incomplete and his discussion is of similar quality.  Given the excellent quality of research being done on this topic, this book falls into a dont-bother-with category.	2002-08-22

In one magnificent book Davis blasts to pieces the notion that \\"free trade\\" existed or will liberate the 3rd World.  Far more serious, though, is Davis' charge that imperialists __made__ the 3rd World.  <br />Indeed, Davis documents the extraction of wealth from India, China, Brazil, and Egypt; showing how each was reduced to a mere skeleton, and how even their marrows were sucked dry.  <br />In times of drought, Britain actually _increased_ taxation and food exports from famine stricken India.  He then proves that British imperialists were well aware of the famine, and allowed the policies to continue.  Worse still, they offered food relief only in exchange for hard labor, at a caloric ratio slightly worse than that of the Nazi death camp at Buchenwald.  By British estimates roughly 20 million Indians died, while their colonial masters spouted racist mantras. <br />In other measures the British merely fostered a devasting blight of globalization, unaware of its cruel consequences.  Yet Davis shows that the British mission to \\"civilize\\" India curtailed Indian economic growth: Indian incomes were frozen for 300 years, while the British boasted about railroads, telegraphs, and other trinkets of technology ('gifts' which helped the Empire rule and rob India). <br />The book is weakest in its discussions of China and Brazil. One might be served well by reading just his chapters on India.  <br />Davis' book shatters the currently relentless propaganda about growth, development, and free trade, and raises serious questions for the 21st century.  The book is nothing short of a masterpiece, and deserves a suitably large audience.	2002-07-17

This is a tremendous resource, particularly for the occassional hiker/backpacker.  One could say that _all_ of the Cascades are beautiful--and they are.  But too often, books by the Mountaineers make everything sound wonderful, even if its been clear-cut, has limited views, or is crowded.  I've never had a bad time in the Cascades, but some hikes are less spectacular than others. <br />If you're only heading into the woods a few times a year, why not shoot for the very best?

This is akin to a Holocaust survivor marrying a member of the Nazi S.S.  All fans of this book (mostly young White men) need to address the deep sexism and misogyny here. <br />The plot is hackneyed and boring: a man pursues his dreams and ideals despite a world of cartoonish idiots around him.  It's how teenage boys often feel.  There is a hatefulness of weakness, gentleness, and calm: no wonder many right-wingers celebrate Rand. <br />The goal is admirable: to think for oneself and be creative, but the novel is truly a piece of junk.  Why not read true artists who urge you to think for yourself?  Jack Kerouac, Emma Goldman, Ken Kesey, and John Steinbeck are some wonderful alternatives.  <br />After all, you don't have to hate the world, and hate women, to live a creative, independent life.  You can love your society, community, and your lover, and be true to yourself... All at the same time.	2002-06-29

When one considers the amount of data--photos, songs, animation, etc.-- which can be held on a CD-rom, it's shameful that this product is so sparsely outfitted. <br />What we have here are some maps of Western Civ, and some questions to accompany them. Both the software and the historical material feel quite outdated and hackneyed, as if produced twenty years ago.<br />Besides being unsophisticated, the material is classical in the sense that it overlooks the roles of everyday people, working classes, slaves, and immigrants, in favor of shifting borders, wars, and the like. Aren't we ready to teach our students better history? <br />A big disappointment. They can do much, much more than this.	2002-06-13

Fagan is a smart archaelogist, and does not reduce human history to weather; rather he shows how weather can influence politics, religion, agriculture, and economics.  Fagan could have made this point more clearly: weather can sometimes be influential; it's not determinative.<br />Fagan offers a good direction for archaelogists and historians to head; more serious works would do well to take up Fagan's challenge to analyze historical weather patterns.  It'll be a tough go, but well-worth the trouble.<br />One of the book's strongest chapters is Chapter 11, showing how French colonial rule in the Sahel helped to impoverish and starve peoples living there, while increasing desertification.  Here, he echoes the theme of the vastly superior _Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino and the Making of the Third World_.  This latter book, by Mike Davis, is one of the most important books of recent decades.  Where Fagan fails to consider structural inequalities and human suffering as a result of El Ninos, Davis fully succeeds.  The books make for some nice contrasts (I assigned both to my college students).  Turn to Davis, after you've had fun with Fagan.	2002-05-03

Each episode--each democracy overthrown, each corruption of justice--is dealt with in a speedy and light way. It makes a great reference for those who are familiar with the way U.S. power operates, or a nice intro. for those who are just learning. Actually, Blum is a lot softer on the U.S. than he needs to be: he doesn't really get into neo-colonialism, the IMF, the WTO, and the way that multinational corporations have the third world enslaved. His critique fixates on covert military operations--a significant, but incomplete view of U.S. global domination. <br /> At times, Blum's references and tone are quite lightweight (after the feds snag your computer on suspected drug dealing or terrorism, \\"the good ol' boys have a thigh-slappin' time reading your personal mail.\\" p. 253). But overal, Blum is indignant that the U.S. attacks democracy and freedom around the world, in the name of \\"national security\\" or the \\"war on terrorism.\\" He'll leave you informed and outraged. And hopefully, he'll leave you crying for justice.	2002-05-01

Most are from the last century, with a healthy sampling from WWI and WWII, as well as sampling of rock art, commercial posters, and sports posters.  A great strenth of the book is the attention it devotes to the representations and self-representations of women and ethnic minorities.  Some of the most powerful pieces in the book are the many protest posters from the 1960s and 1970s.  The book offers minimal text to analyze the work; instead concentrating on high quality prints from an excellent and wide-ranging assortment of American posters.  A valuable and beautiful fragment of history.	2002-04-17

So, for example, you get an Irangate interview done in 1987; since then we've learned even more about how Reagan torpedoed democracy, truth, and justice in the U.S. and abroad.  <BR>     Most of the themes in this book are picked up in more recent works by Chomsky, who manages always to stay current, and always to remind you of history. <BR>     While this book is very easy to read and nicely organized about one (large) region, the interviews could have been better edited (see Barsamian's work with Chomsky).  I think you're better off getting one Chomsky's more recent works.	2002-04-10

It is a lonely world of randomness and drift.  Some might say Johnson's characters aren't &quot;3D&quot;, but that's because they're so richly flat.  And when Johnson takes us into Jamie's descent into madness, it is a mind-bending trip.  <br />Yet somehow, Johnson's writing left me exhilerated and happy.  I enjoyed this book immensely and had trouble putting it down--I would rank it among the best I've read over the last five years.	2001-02-05

Haywood's book is not the best of the world history atlasses, but easily the best bargain. For twenty bucks you get a beautiful, large, full-color book, with clear, accurate maps.  I might prefer that the text was a bit more general, with fewer obscure historical details--at times, the text is oddly esoteric.  Still, the book offers broad brushstrokes about agrigculture, technology, world religions, and empires.  I also appreciate the diversity of the discussion: Africa and Asia get a healthy amount of attention, so that the book feels more truly like *world* (and not European) history.  I could quibble here and there with parts of the book, but the book is gorgeous, pleasurable, and at the price, this is an outstanding achievement.	2000-12-15

At under ten bucks, you can get maps of world history to refer to.  However, there are a few problems: (1) The book offers no text to explain history.  So you really need to know the history yourself or have companion books to help; (2) the book emphasizes European state history, and shortchanges other nations, cultural changes, religious movements, migrations, slavery, technologies, etc.  This is mostly a book of maps showing the changing territories of nations.  ////  I was hoping to assign this book to my college Geography students, but will not, nor do I have much use for it myself.  I much prefer the other Hammond world historical atlas, even at the higher cost. Most of the new, larger world historical atlasses are superior, becuase they show that history is so much more than states.  In sum, this book is a disappointment, useful to a very limited audience.	2000-12-07

Like a cheerleader, Kimura jumps with joy as Fujimori violates Peru's constitution--she calls his despotic attack on Congress &quot;a daring bid to wrench control.&quot;  Fujimori came under international condemnation, but Kimura dismisses any concern, calling it a mere &quot;ruckus about human rights and democracy.&quot;  Kimura is so intent on making Fujimori a hero, that she doesn't seem to mind all of the citizens he tortured.  Nor does she have anything but praise for Fujimori's brutal neo-liberal reforms, which caused terrible suffering for millions of poor Peruvians: she prefers to call it &quot;the Peruvian Miracle.&quot;  Kimora thinks that the ends justify the means, but what are the ends?  Peru is beset with poverty, military terror, and daily violence.  And now we learn that Fujimori was corrupt to the core, stealing millions of dollars from the nation, while children go hungry.

As a member of the  Seattle anarcho-punk scene during the same years (early-mid 1990s), I can  say that the authors got it right.  And they take you along on the ride, in  the back of dirty vans, in punk shared houses, in trips to steal from  K-mart.  Yeah--it does read like a zine, but (A) that's a good thing and  (B) it reads like a really good zine.  But Schweser and Himelstein give us  more than just a novel about DC punk life, they also critique it from  within; showing its weaknesses and hypocrisies.  They give particular  attention to challenging a rabid, angst-ridden riot grrl, who's breed of  feminism is uncomfortable with the world.  The critique is weakened in its  caricature, but it does raise some interesting questions about one narrow  type of feminism, political intolerance, and fun in the punk scene.   Hopefully some good discussions will be inspired by this book, which tells  a lively tale, states its beefs, and celebrates the creativity and autonomy  of anarcho-punk.	2000-09-16

Yet its relevance cannot really extend  to America, which has a markedly different system of class.  The French  have deeply entrenched class consciousness, in both a pragmatic sense and a  Marxist sense, whereas 90% of Americans consider themselves &quot;middle  class.&quot;    Bourdieu shows that the French are at pains to  symbolically express their class differences, and he does so with aplomb.   He compiles statistics and data which show ways in which the French produce  their own class position through consumption, education, and taste.          But his observations are less applicable to the vast American  &quot;middle class.&quot;  Class mobility, education, and stylistic  expression are much more democratically distributed in America.  So while  many French are content with their class position, vocation, and  traditions, most Americans see themselves as &quot;middle class,&quot;  striving for better, and free from tradition.        _Distinction_ is  an interesting and accesible book, but those looking for Bourdieu's  contributions to social theory will be better served by some of his other  works.	2000-09-11

I've never heard Rimbaud's band Crass, and loved this book  all the same.  Rimbaud sets up an interesting double story line: that of  his own life and that of Wally--a flower child.  In a sense, the collapse  of Wally's dreams, his ruination at the hands of the English mental health  system, and the right-wing onslaught of Thatcher serve to explain punk.  As  hippie dreams failed, and as socialist alternatives proved barbaric, punk  birthed new autonomous languages to own meanings apart from states,  corporations, and utopias.        Rimbaud is a creative writer--at times  beautiful in his freedoms, while on other pages his disorder is  inneffectual and tedious.  But so it goes with punk, in which one makes  one's own rules and one's own discoveries of beauty.  Others can take your  ideas or leave them. If others share the vision, so much the better.  As  always, Rimbaud's vision appeals to many of us across the decades and on  either side of oceans.	2000-09-05

What North Americans tasted in Seattle (Nov 1999) has been going on in Britain for a solid decade.  The new protest movement is a fusion of environmentalism and anarchist theory,  with a dose of art and drugs in the mix.  These forces have come together  in the aftermath of the Cold War, as Thatherite and Reaganite politics are  eaten by the maggots of history.  Now that we can dispense with the Red  Scare crap, a new left movement is targetting greedy corporations,  gluttonous consumerism, and ecocidal social practices.  This book gives a  good introduction to those protests in Britain, even as they are spilling  into North America.  Recommended for academics, punks, anarchists, and  politically engaged people of all stripes and spots.	2000-06-15

People always complain about the part of  the book which emphasizes party politics in Spain, and you can easily skip  that--or, you can peer into a seminal experience for Orwell.  His  frustrations with the Stalin-supported Spanish communists drove him to  write 1984 and Animal Farm.  Orwell is better known for these  anti-communist writings and less so for his own socialist creed and deep  compassion for the poor.  Homage to Catalonia captures both his admiration  of the working classes and his abject fear of communism.  For the writing,  for the vision of collectivism, for the war journalism, for the eyewitness  accounts of crucial history, and for many more reasons, this book should be  a part of everyone's library.	2000-02-06
