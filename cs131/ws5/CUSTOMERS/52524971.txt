Webster would have made<br /><br />a real contribution to American literature.	2005-03-10

I don't know what happened to the Melanie Rawn I fell in<br /><br />love with during the \\"Dragon Prince\\" trilogy?  The characters<br /><br />were so great, the story simple but the action compelling.<br /><br />The two books in the \\"Exiles\\" series were just plain awful.  I am sorry, but they were phoned in.<br /><br />The whole story behind the \\"Rising\\" and the characters allegedly involved in it just never went anywhere.  I mean, all they do is get chased around all through the story, only to wake up one day and \\"BAM\\"!  They win.  Just like that.  Plus, Sara was so annoying!  I will be a part of the Rising one day, she swears over and over again and really doesn't do anything once she tries to weasel her way in, only to be like the leader of it in book two, with nothing to show for it!  Give me a break.  Cailet was the same way.  She is like Luke Skywalker, who only after a few days of Jedi training, is now the most powerful wizard in the world?  Whatever.<br /><br />Melaine needs to get back to basics.  I'm not saying another \\"Dragon Prince\\" like trilogy.  But just better storytelling.  Better character development.  Come back, Melanie!

Historians often don't realize that we the readers don't find the author's level of examination as interesting as they do.  Praise to the author for his effort, but I think the thesis of Stalin being a madman was assumed before going in, so the metric ton of evidence presented was useful but unnecessary.	2005-03-09

His early life's story in and of itself is compelling beyond his accomplishments later on.  I really enjoyed his telling of fighting in the hagannah and later in the '48 war against the Arab invasions.<br /><br />But the capture of Eichmann is the watershed moment in 20th century Jewish history that all should hold up as the defining characteristic of the Jewish people as a whole.  We will not be the whipping boys of Europe or the world anymore.  We will seek out our enemies wherever they are, regardless of the circumstances, and take them to be held up before justice.<br /><br />The courage Malkin and his compatriots is the story of us all.	2005-03-09

It's too bad that historical scholarship won't allow this kind of speculative research to be taken seriously.  It is a challenging exercise for any historian to undertake.  I think most historians have done this one or twice in their fields of study, just to flesh out their own theories on events.  But they won't admit it.  Well, this is your chance!

Firstly, being from NYC he has probably already encountered most if not all the indigenous peoples of the countries he travels, so really no surprises there.  Plus, as we all know from \\"Kitchen Confidential\\", Tony will eat ANYTHING!  Which he proves in fine style from a beating Cobra Heart to a snot-like breakfast in Japan.<br /><br />Finally, how could anyone not like Tony Bourdain?  He is the aptheosis of cool!

What with the movie and all the stuff on the History Channel et al to capitalize on it, I thought his book would get lost in the deep end of this entertainment sewer.<br /><br />But was I wrong!  I should have held faith in Pressfield being the best historical fiction author of our time (after Patrick O'Brian of course!!).<br /><br />The detail of tactical engagement of Alexander's armies against the Persians is astonishing.  It works without being too wordy or dry.  I also like how it does not go too much into his death, or its aftermath.  The story of his accomplishments speaks for itself.	2005-03-09

I feel a little duped here...<br /><br />The title of the book, \\"To the Last Man\\", implies that the book is about the soldier in the trenches.  The cover art shows soldiers coming out of the trenches as well.  I was excited about the prospect of reading fiction about the soldiers in the trenches.  And the introductory chapter came through for me in fine style.  Very well written and should have gotten the book off to a good start.<br /><br />Then Shaara spends the next dozen or so chapters on fighter pilots!  How did his story of the pilots related to the title \\"To the Last Man\\"?  I can understand a need to place the entire story of the war into its historical context, but this facet of the story went on forever and ever!<br /><br />My attentions were barely holding on when we got to General Pershing and the AEF, but even then it fell a little flat.  Too much politics and not enough on the soldiers themselves.<br /><br />Not Shaara's best work in my opinion.  Though I shall remain a loyal fan.	2005-02-09

I agree with the Pugh review that he was attempting to challenge his fans (of which I am one and still remain...) to see Richard from a unique perspective.  But I just couldn't get into it.  I think the book would have worked better if Goodkind focused more on Jennsen and never bothered us with Oba.  He spent way too much time on Oba who's actions could have been served by anyone from, say, the Sisters of the Dark or even Sebastian.  Plus, it was kind of confusing when we're one minute with Richard in the forest, and then - BAM! - we're at the Pillars and the story suddenly comes to and end with no set up.<br />I was disappointed in this portion of what is otherwise a brilliant series.  I hope the next book is better.	2002-01-15
