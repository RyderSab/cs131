Surprises me that she ever went the self-publish route at all as the quality of the writing is well above average. The cat pieces and the poetry were not my thing, but I skipped over them and felt I did not miss out for having done so. My favorite piece was the cell phone story. <br />My \\"quibbles\\" concern her brothers. Perhaps being a male reader accounts for it, but she came off as overly-dismissive of them. It is explained that they are significantly younger, making sibling \\"bonding\\" difficult. I was able to take that into consideration. At one point she states that being boys they didn't count (or words to that effect). If that was meant to be flippant, it didn't work for me. I was left with the impression that there are unresolved \\"issues\\" there, which detracted from the easy-going tone elsewhere. <br />Related, but pickier still, was the use of the term \\"girlchild\\" - by someone who clearly pokes fun at the use of \\"womyn\\" at the festival. Is \\"daughter\\" such an awful word? Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think I should be left wondering about it.	2005-07-25

I've finally come to the conclusion that Caroline Myss has steeped herself in so much philosophy-speak from her \\"research\\" that she takes it for granted that others (of average intelligence) should be able to follow along with her rapid-fire delivery along those lines. Here is where I finally decided that that she has become addicted to the audience attention of the lecture \\"lifestyle\\": \\"I don't know that much about the 9th and 10th chakras yet ...\\"; the words weren't there, but the tone clearly communicated \\"So, you're going to have to wait a while for me to be able to explain them to you.\\" <br />She says she is a born teacher, and perhaps she is right. I won't quibble with that self-assessment, as such. It's her tone on audio that is tough. Impassioned some would say - or is it strident? Fervor or frustration? Your call. <br />Getting back to this production, I found it slow going so skipped the first tape; she wrapped up with chakra #1 at the beginning of the 2nd cassette, so I did not feel I missed much. The rest of the chakras were covered on tapes 2, 3 and 4. I found listening worthwhile for ideas such as not letting your head over-rule your heart's desire, etc. Tape 5 starts in with the archetypes. I'm sorry, but I have problems with that aspect of her \\"teachings.\\" She, herself, has stated that she is developing even *more* of them beyond the many she's come up with. Are we supposed to go around continuously monitoring our own and others' behavior to slot that into her patterns? <br />She mentioned in passing that her lectures cost $2500 (twenty five hundred dollars) to attend. She continues to come up with \\"new\\" archetypes (presumably with new Archetype Cards one can purchase as well). Think about it.	2005-06-19

I'm highly recommending it with one caveat (hence the missing ratings star).<br /><br />I listened to it as an unabridged audio book. It starts off slowly, but moves along well once he and Iris hit Thailand. There are two sections near the beginning (one in Hong Kong and one in Bangkok) told in third-person narratives.

I stopped listening after the first Q&A of tape 2.<br /><br />Some reviewers have blasted this author for challenging a victim of child abuse. I have my issues with Dr. Myss and her presentations; however, I found her follow-up there valid. This woman had clearly taken on \\"victim\\" as an identity. Moving on to the larger picture, the lecture itself struck me as having no real point. She stresses forgiveness-as-a-healing-mechanism heavily at the end, yet the preceding talk doesn't support it.<br /><br />As for Part 2, she sounded as though she wanted to be anywhere but at the interview. She appeared either bored or distracted. As a generalization, without going into impressions from her (and others' similar) work, there seems to be a level of burnout where the \\"expert\\" realizes that (s)he has said pretty much all there is to say, in as many ways as possible.	2005-06-13

A disclaimer at the outset: I skipped over virtually ever scene involving Lenny as he seemed so creepy from the get-go. <br />So, who's to like here? Maybe the father, but he's largely a flashback character. The mother?  She had potential early on as being frustrated in the Orthodox life she came to regret; by the end she's rich, bitter and well ... not much else. The older sister? Close, but she expresses enough bitterness herself to be out of the running. The rest were not really significant enough to have mattered much to me - and, yes, I did get confused between \\"Shirl\\" and \\"Shirley Sugarman\\". To keep the alliteration, the author should've gone for Sandy or Sadie for one of those two women. <br />The dust jacket makes mention of Hillside as an \\"Anti-Semitic\\" suburb. I kept waiting for examples; mention of vandalism is covered in one sentence near the end. That's pretty much it. <br />I gave it a second star because the author is actually a talented writer (except as noted above).  Too bad she wasted it on the story of a shallow, self-centered, self-pitying, materialistic brat.	2005-06-11

Dyer takes the first half - starting with a long, metaphorical story before s-l-o-w-l-y filling out his time to (finally!) state that you need a firmly fixed idea of what you DO want, because concentrating on eliminating negatives in your life only gives them more power/energy from those thoughts.  Chopra takes a scientific approach with a long discussion of energy and matter. Their talks did not seem not integrated; they must have split the promotional cost of the event, each guy gave his own (individual) spiel, then they split the take at the door afterwards.	2005-06-10

Looking for some not-so-serious reading material after a lot of non-fiction, I decided to go back and try a couple of earlier books in this series.  I couldn't get into one of them much at all (Vestibule), but figured that was ok, as it was somewhat atypical. <br />Bouillon was more standard (being set in Aleford helped). I would have just let this one go without a review as \\"Not great, not bad, worked as intended to fill miscellaneous time (bus rides, etc.).\\" What's the problem? I'm not politically correct by any stretch of the imagination, but the depiction of Chief Coffin of Byford struck me hard. He is no longer up to the job, yet the townspeople cannot bring themselves to let him go. The author explains this away as a \\"Yankee\\" thing - I'd say, perhaps, a small town thing instead. I found myself cheering for him when he is outright nasty to Faith. I was left wondering if the editor challenged this character at all. I would have done so. <br />Bottom line: Ms. Page's writing matures as the series progresses. The books are not really dependent on each other (\\"Fjord\\" restricts Faith's roles to a couple of cameo appearances). Consider skipping the first few books if you're new to the series, and don't go back if you missed those. <br /> <br />	2005-06-09

This title was available as a one-file download for mp3 players from my library, so I re-read it. This time, I appreciated Mr. LHM's way with words even more. The writing is downright brilliant. <br />Others have complained that he is depressing, gloomy, etc. It's a 10,000 mile trip - if you want someone who's consistently upbeat, go read \\"Pollyanna\\"! For the most part, the author seems to like the folks he meets, appreciates the scenery, and gives interesting historical asides to the places along his route.  A negative?  All that detail makes a long book seem even longer. At Portland, OR he makes his one stopover in a city; it's also the point where he starts heading back east again. One might consider putting the book aside there, and picking up a short read of a totally different nature, before coming back for the return journey. <br />	2005-06-09

This recording was available from my library as an mp3 download, so I thought I'd check her out (pun not intended, but it does fit). Here are my impressions: <br /> <br />I hadn't realized, until later in the program, that one was supposed to be familiar with the archetype subject matter beforehand (from reading her book).  I was able to appreciate the program, but would urge those of you who haven't listened yet to get a grasp of the archetype concept first - you'll be glad you did. The last part concerns her \\"wheel\\" tool: archetypes (not-so-subtly) morph in astrological signs. <br /> <br />In the course of these four hours, there are regular references to objects, gestures, etc. onstage that are lost on audio. I've listened to other, similar seminar recordings where this hasn't been a problem, but here it is noticeable when it occurs. <br />	2005-06-09

Members of The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy have been insisting that the Oklahoma schools have been infiltrated by a lesbian underground. One sapphic clique's secrets cause Jo to head down there at the request of her best friend, Weezer.  I like this series because Jo is Jo. The money she inherited at the end of the first book (apologies if that's a spoiler) hasn't changed her at all. I'd like the next one to show her life in Buffalo though; that aspect of her world seems lacking, and will be more so should she continue driving off to other locales.

The plot is inane, even for this series; it might make a short story, but too drawn out a gimmick for a full book here. I really didn't care much about the characters. Tris was so cold that it was hard to see what Simon ever saw in him. I did come to like Giles a bit more than I had. His mother (who makes a cameo appearance), and all of the other locals, were pretty much absent. Robin Chase was detecting of course, but the author plays him so subtlely regarding any interest he may have in Simon that he seems to serve as the token metrosexual/closet case (your call) who throws a few sniping comments Simon's way upon appearance. <br />I would have given the book the full 4 stars until I read the preceding review about the language. Simon uses British slang way too much for only having lived there a year or so! The one time he uses a solid Americanism (I believe it was \\"buck-o\\" or somesuch regarding Giles' attack) I was slightly jolted. He isn't English; the reader should be more conscious that he's an [southern] American.	2005-04-29

I'm on Tape 2 of the unabridged audio version, and find myself unable to continue. It was very difficult to keep the characters straight when they were all introduced at the business meeting (no family tree on tape!). However, I kinda managed to get past that. My problem is the mystery angle; I just don't care who offed the old lady! These are stock characters to me, with a bit of melodrama thrown in. <br />I can fully understand the author's wanting to branch out beyond Judge Knott (whose books I really like). This effort seemed a slightly wishy-washy way of doing so in having a similar enough protagonist and being set in the same area as the Knott series.	2005-04-19

That leads into a point that struck me as contradictory - perhaps another reviewer could clear it up, aqnd if anyone feels I'm \\"giving away a plot twist\\" I apologize (although I really don't think so):  Eleanore's column says it is unfair that Jalena wins a contest \\"no longer living in town to move to Wisteria to be with her new husband\\" - later Colin mentions he's going to run for Mayor against the incumbent. Ummmm .... he's not a New Kassel resident yet no one in the story seems to question that?

It was understandable that she is hostile to him when he re-appears, but she continues with it long after he gets over their past and actually displays genuine concern. That was annoying. <br />My other problem was with Roger, Kitty's long-lost nephew.  Perdida goes on and on about how certain she is that he'll inherit everything, even though Kitty continues to consider her as a \\"daughter\\" - not for a nanosecond did I ever believe that she would change her will to significantly alter the provisions (esp regarding the land Perdida uses for her business). Kitty even hints (a couple of times) that she isn't all that impressed with Roger. That aspect of the story was downright depressing. I'm not a shrink, but Perdida was displaying classic symptoms of depression and paranoia (to me at least) while Lucas and the doctor were concerned that she *might* have a breakdown soon? <br />This is an entertaining enough book, although it wasn't a fast read for me.

I'm back! <br />I liked the friendship between Len and Walter, as well as Crystal - she and Walter hit it off, and I would be interested to see more of them in future. Also, having never been to that area I found the author talented at setting scenes.  There is promise here for a series. That having been said ... <br />This \\"book\\" is a self-published draft with a pretty cover (is that Len pictured?) and horrific type. I nearly went blind trying to read it inflight. Regarding repetition in the writing as mentioned by another reviewer, I was struck by a paragraph in which the author uses the word \\"apartment\\" four times in four consecutive sentences! It is obvious that this is a \\"cold\\" draft; she needs to find an editor - or at least get someone with good English skills (not to knock hers but one can't be objective about one's own work) to look it over. <br />That aside, we don't really get much about Len's background, other than that he is independently wealthy: no previous work history (was he always wealthy?), no previous relationships, nothing really. I don't recall even much of a description of him. <br />I didn't really care for \\"Marilyn\\" much - she seems rather silly and inconsequential, thus Len's infatuation rang kinda hollow to me. If Len is so perceptive, he should realize that she is never going to \\"date\\" him, but sees him as a \\"pal\\". <br />Would I read a sequel - sure.  Would I pay full price for another (self-published) rough draft? Nope. <br /> <br />	2005-03-06

I read the reviews here as I was partway through the audio edition (narrated by the author).  Sadly, the name-dropping increased as the book progressed. <br />Jazzy-the-dog seems secondary to the story - a prop. I had a tough time buying the fact that he could wreck her important business documents. etc. and she never sent him off to obedience training. <br />For all her name-dropping it seemed rather obvious to me that there was a pattern of her \\"friends\\" being deposed shahs, dictators, etc. It will be interesting to see how many of those \\"celebs\\" return her calls the day her column ceases. The Birthday Party episode struck me as garish ( tres Nouveau Riche). The not-so-subtle dissing of her beloved husband's relatives was creepy. <br />In summary, the book certainly gives us a thorough insight into Cindy's character; but not the one she was hoping for!	2005-03-02

In spite of her Gallic surname, Ms. Herbert's pronounciation seems way, way off.  One example: is the city \\"Marseilles\\" really pronounced \\"Mar-SAY-uh\\" as she insists? Other non-English words and place names have equally odd inflections I've never encountered before. <br /> <br />I knew nothing of this author - execpt that she was a noted food writer - prior to picking up this book.  She mentions being in Europe with her children for long stretches, yet makes no mention of their father, which I found curious.  No mention of how she is supporting herself all this time, just prose-y observations.	2005-02-28

She can't exactly pick up and keep going the way she was been so far with each installment. <br />I liked the fact that it was more low-key than the previous ones.

I read the reviews here part way through listening to the book on audio, deciding that others were (perhaps) a bit harsh on him for being a \\"dilletante\\" in the workforce. Now that I've finished the book, I'm tempted to agree that he was. <br /> <br />I'm baffled that he got most of these jobs (for which he was clearly over-qualified) in the first place. Specifically, he is hired at Cosi and Borders in Manhattan for jobs that barely cover his train fare (after taxes).  Agreed that his exits seem abrupt. And, yeah, \\"names have been changed ...\\" would have worked better than \\"let's call him 'Joe' ....\\" <br /> <br />To be fair, he gives the job his all when he does get hired, whether he needs the money or not. The book is fairly well written. Another case where I wish Amazon had 3.5 stars available.	2005-02-12

I want to like this series. However, after reading the latest offering, I'm hard pressed to muster much, if any, enthusiasm for the one that will follow this book. <br /> <br />One thing, right off the bat was that I had no way to picture Mel at all. It was stressed that he is very good looking and a swell dresser. That didn't narrow it down much for me. Can't say as I recall details of Jane or Shelley's looks either; but, that wasn't as much of an issue - perhaps because their parts are so character-driven. <br /> <br />The mystery angle was OK (standard cozy). The premise that Paul bought the theater \\"on impulse\\" was a bit contrived and out-of-character; Shelley wouldn't be quite so fatalistic about the fact that the building was unusable (thus the donation as a loss-cutting mechanism). The catering issue was a bit weak, but buy-into-able (though transparently so), to get Jane involved with the murder mystery. <br /> <br />The book deal sub-plot was more than I could swallow though. Without re-reading the previous story, here's that chronology as I understand it ... <br /> <br />Jane had been working on her story for several years, off and on, before deciding to bring an outline and sample chapters to a mystery convention (a few months before this current story begins); registrants are provided the opportunity to present their ideas to a couple of editors for review. One of the editors likes what she saw of Jane's work, suggesting Jane send her a finished manuscript when the entire book is complete. Felicity, a noted mystery writer with whom Jane becomes friends is also favorably impressed with Jane's proposal. So far, so good. Credibility intact. <br /> <br />In this book, Jane mentions to Shelley that she sent the manuscript to Felicity for feedback, who sent back her suggestions for revision (chiefly, moving the \\"mystery\\" angle up by 100 pages). Jane tells Shelley that she spent \\"two days\\" on revision, and then sent a second draft out to the editor(note that Felicity's is the only feedback Jane gets on her work before sending it out) Two days? I would think that one would need a lot more revision (AND feedback!) than that. <br /> <br />I realize that this is fiction, but Jane's good fortune here was mind-boggling. The editor dropped what she was doing (in late July!) to devote her attention to convincing the marketing department to accept Jane's story for immediate acceptance. Within a couple of weeks of receiving a second draft from an unpublished fiction author (granted they met at the conference), the editor calls Jane offering a contract?  Moreover, when a stunned Jane asks about changes, Melody tells her she doesn't need any? She then insists that Jane get an agent to negotiate the contract. <br />HEL-LO? If Melody's so concerned about not negitiating directly with a [new] author, shouldn't she have advised Jane to get an agent at their initial meeting back at the convention? Wouldn't Felicity have advised her to send a [final] draft to potential agents, with advice to stress to that Melody had liked what she saw? <br /> <br />I understand that the author is trying to set Jane up as a literary success, which is fine. However, unless Jane is incredibly talented, these events unfolded in a totally bizarre fashion. It would have been much more realistic for Melody to have returned the manuscript with a cover letter containing some very positive comments (and suggested changes), and informing Jane that she (Melody) was looking forward to receiving the next draft directly from an agent.  That would have been entirely credible to me. <br /> <br />The epilogue format was odd, and really left me wondering about the author's intentions for the balance of the series. <br />	2005-01-03

The reader gets a full sensory blast. The supporting characters (Crystal, her special-ed nephew, etc.) are clear and functional, without intruding on the story. The development of the mother, Tamar, works well also. At first I found her cold, cold, cold! But, she comes into her own by the end. <br /> <br />The Big Con:  Clara winter [sic] herself. She is way too precocious for me. Had the author made it clear that this was an adult looking back after many years, that might have helped. However, from my reading I inferred that Clara was relating these incidents within a year or so (age 12/13). <br />Much is made of her outstanding vocabulary. Okay - she's a voracious reader; frankly, I thought she belonged in a gifted/talented/honors program. Her socialization, on the other hand, is a mess. Her mother remarks several times on how \\"wierd\\" Clara is. Yet, she seems unconcerned; if it were my kid, I would have taken a more active role before then. <br />This character reminded me of a non-fiction author I ran across a while back. That writer made a point of mentioning how she \\"devoured\\" Jane Austen, etc. in grade school!  Well, sure, a very bright kid might get the words in themselves, but no kid \\"gets\\" human relationships enough at that age. That was the case here. Clara w's musings, opinings, etc. are too adult - the \\"voice\\" of the character didn't ring true for me. On a related note, she repeats herself a lot! I listened to the audio, but would have likely skimmed parts with a print version. <br /> <br />Overall: The author is a very, very talented writer.  Had she made it an older Clara looking back (and toned down a bit on the musings here and there), I could easily have given this five stars and a header of \\"Excellent job!\\"	2004-12-10

It is 2/3 Sylvia-on-Sylvia and 1/3 \\"audience participation\\". The former comes across as stand-up comedy mixed in with common sense you could get from your grandmother.  The latter is the more interesting section. Pay attention when she makes assertions that the audience member contradicts (\\"No, my father was 6'6\\" and had black hair\\" to Sylvia's seeing a \\"little guy with blond hair\\" etc.) There are very few \\"direct hits\\" among her assertions. Sylvia first tries to backpeddle the assertion to the circumstances provided in response; if that fails, she changes the subject, rather than admitting she was wrong.

I had gotten a couple of her lectures-on-tape from the library (as much stand-up comedy as spirituality). In the first one (\\"Making Contact ...\\", I believe) she categorically, emphatically stated that one does NOT \\"see auras\\" - she goes so far as to suggest that those who claim to do so see an eye doctor. On Page 11 of this book \\"Francine\\" spends two paragraphs referring to aura colors, specifically on \\"cementing\\" one's aura to green or blue. Contradictory? I think so. <br />I'll be honest, the more I read of Sylvia, the more skeptical I become.  <br />	2004-09-21

Gertrude was saved by her (ill-disguised) concern when she realized her daughter might be in trouble, but was as annoyingly over-the-top as the rest of the gang. Regarding Judith herself, she never seemed all that concerned or frightened; it seemed more that she worked at solving the murder because it \\"inconvenienced\\" her. <br />Two final points: 1) Judith says she \\"only saw Luke once, [across the room] at the Caf ...\\" yet she has a face-to-face encounter with him later that day? 2) Phyliss-the-fundie-cleaninglady is a HOOT! <br />	2004-08-31

It becomes work to re-acquaint ourselves with the protagonist and her world. This book didn't suffer as much from that as Paretsky's \\"Blacklist\\" did for me, but I wasn't able to jump right into it either. <br /> <br />As for \\"Dangerous Hour\\" itself ... Sharon is now a corporate executive - a far cry from her earlier adventures. I wasn't connecting with the \\"danger\\" here. The whole villain conspiracy thing came across as a major inconvenience, rather than the intended threat. Also, her penny-pinching ways became quickly annoying. The hiring freeze I could understand, but I found myself siding with Ted's sarcasm when he says, \\"If that's a problem, Shar, I'll pay for the pizzas out-of-pocket and you can reimburse me later.\\" <br /> <br />I am not a native Spanish speaker. However ... I believe the author's intent in naming the non-profit group \\"Jobs for All\\" would have been better served as \\"Trabajo PARA Todos\\" rather than her \\"Trabajo Por Todos\\"? <br /> <br />One final note: I recall liking the Elena Oliverez books when they came out years ago. I felt cheated that Elena appears in this story with barely a cameo role. <br />	2004-08-22

I don't care for that genre at all, so cannot comment on her talent in that area. What I can opine is that it didn't work for me with Kinsey here. I'm hoping she (or they) admits it was rebound sex on his part and infatuation on hers, and then she moves on. <br /> Reba was an interesting character, but I'm not interested in seeing her again as a co-protagonist. She make a much better pal - at most she'd do well \\"unofficially\\" helping Kinsey with computer stuff as the series chugs into the 90's. <br /> Henry's sub-plot came off as annoyingly childish; it seemed there solely as a reason to keep him in the story and nothing else. <br /> Overall: as others have commented, the story is very heavy on description/setting. Unfortunately, that does little to advance the plot. Only once did I ever get the feeling that Kinsey was in any danger, and that episode came to nothing as far as her part was concerned. <br /> I'm looking forward to &quot;S&quot;, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the stakes are higher next time.	2004-08-03

Warshawski Novel)	Books	3	10	13	N	N	Better luck next time	The writing quality itself is Paretsky's usual good stuff; however, I'm subtracting two stars: one because the politics got in the way of the story and one for the confusing cast of characters. Available blurbs cover the plot structure fairly comprehensively, but I'll try not to give away any \\"secrets\\".<BR>By the time the Egyptian kid enters the story directly, fairly far along in the book, I've forgotten exactly what he had \\"done\\" to deserve such attention from the Feds - aside from attending a suspect mosque on a regular basis. That aspect of the plot was handled in such an exaggerated manner that I had trouble suspending disbelief. The author might rebut that such a scenario \\"might be possible\\" under this draconian law. I'm not willing to agree.<BR>Frankly I'm surprised Paretsky was able to get away with so many supporting characters speaking with, basically, two voices among them: \\"privileged Caucasian person\\" and \\"well educated African-American\\". The members of each group were, for the most part, indistinguishable from each other after a while.<BR>Further confusing the reader in this long novel, the shadows of several deceased individuals are present. A scorecard was sorely needed; I checked to see if I'd missed a family tree chart at the beginning that might have helped me with this story.<BR>In summary: this would have worked better as two (briefer!) stories - one on the Patriot Act and one on buried secrets from the past. As others have said, the link between the 50's and today doesn't work well enough to hold the two plots together.	2004-06-17

Then we come to The Discovery ... downhill from there. I just wasn't buying that knife.<BR>Frankly, I was rather shocked that Christopher was seriously (Aspies don't joke - they say what they mean) considering stabbing a certain person, but realized he wouldn't be able to get what he needed from that person at that time if he did. HELLO? He would be more concerned about being locked up forever (either in a hospital or prison) I'd think; he's terrified of crossing the authorities already over a mere \\"caution\\".  This incident led me to believe that he is a potential danger-to-himself-and-others. Which leads to ... the subway/tube train incident, where he nearly gets himself killed, then starts ranting about cutting off strangers' fingers (which he has mentioned occasionally) because they show concern for him.  I guess I just didn't buy into the premise that he was capable of such violent thoughts, yet had not gotten into more serious trouble than just hitting a classmate and a cop. In the real world, the authorities would never have let someone go who was on the tracks without permission; Christopher would have been taken into custody for it.<BR>On a related note, I was troubled that he seemed quite so paranoid? I chalked that up, at least in part, to the Stranger Danger material with which he is inundated at school. Was that was a joke - along with Christopher's hatred of France?<BR>I had given up caring much about him by the very end. I did muster up enough enthusiasm to find hid dad's choice of gift inappropriate given the color scheme.<BR>Overall, it seemed as though the author was intent on setting up an Aspie protagonist, which he does fairly well (see above re: knife). It was the plot that was the problem.	2004-04-28

And that's a real shame; I started this story as a die-hard fan of the Jane Lawless series.<br />Bad things happen to greedy, selfish people here. Frankly, by the time the initial \\"mystery\\" from Chapter 1 was explained/revealed it was really too late for me.<BR>I'm truly hoping that part of the problem was an aberration.<br />The flashbacks detracted from the story. I would have preferred Jimmy's story to have been presented as one prologue than as several short pieces inserted at random throughout. If they were intended as transition mechanisms, that failed. They took me out of the present-day action so much that the return was jolting.<br />That's about as specific as I can get without giving away the story to those who haven't read it.<br />The previous volumes have each been self-contained with no recurring characters, aside from Jane's family and friends. However, I came away with loose ends from this book. Either they need to be addressed (by reference) early on in the next one, or Ms. Hart needs to get her pacing back.	2004-03-25

I especially liked the introduction of his concern that he would be \\"outed\\" by not dying in an otherwise fatal accident.    I agree that the series cannot go on much longer with Giles' knowing the truth. Although he may not consciously speculate on some odd aspects of Simon's life, the clues must be racking up sub-consciously.    At this point, their relationship needs some sort of resolution; more of Giles throwing himself at an unwilling Simon will probably turn me off the series for good. It gets too emotionally masochistic/dysfunctional.    That leads to ... Simon's sex life. Or lack thereof. He may not need food, but his hormones seem to be raging along just fine to me. He's been celibate since arriving in the U.K.?    One last thing: do we really need to be reminded of his taking his pills? Those mentionings take me out of the story gratuitously - and annoyingly! I'd like to know what happens if he stops taking them? Perhaps he could misplace some? Or be burgled and have the thief steal them thinking they have a street value of some sort? Perhaps that would cause him to need to turn to someone? Enter Giles!    Simon can be insufferable, but he's never mean or cruel.

We move on to a rather harrowing car chase scene before Maddie arrives home to find the police ahead of her and a dead body in her very own bed.<BR>Sorry, but that was all too much for me to take in - along with a Jag-driving independently wealthy new \\"love interest\\" for Maddie; he appears JUST as Honnett tries to win her back.<BR>I gave up when the \\"decompression\\" session at Wesley's place failed to do more than carry me along in a state of confusion.<BR>Speaking of Wes ... the author has hinted time and again that he's gay. If they are SO very close, wouldn't he have come out to her already? This dancing around his sexuality has been the most annoying feature of the otherwise interesting series: total nonsense!<BR>I give two stars here because I want to give Ms. Farmer another chance. I really do. I'd even try the next book - but not the rest of this one.	2004-02-08
US	42814939	R36ZIDV2NG9SAL	0743236955	229420660	The Music of Your Life: Stories	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Talk about well written!	Though they are gay-oriented, the stories are fairly universal in theme, mostly dealing with kids who know all-too-well they've failed to live to up \\"expectations\\". Most of them are longer than a conventional short story; Mr. Rowell does at times get a tad bogged down in detail. But that's okay. I put them down at those points and picked up the action without a problem later. The author has a great sense of being funny without going over the top and making a serious point without becoming soppy about it.<br />I'm eagerly awaiting the next collection of Mr. Rowell's work.	2004-01-12

Read that one first to get into the protagonists (Marc and Paul).<BR>Mr. Scott is talented and I await the American release of the third volume in the series.<BR>One point he or his editors should note: I'd strongly prefer leaving the text in the original &quot;Australian&quot;! However, if they're hell bent on converting it to<BR>&quot;Standard American&quot;, don't do so halfway with a &quot;harbor&quot; here and a &quot;neighbour&quot; there.<BR>Whoever oversaw that aspect of the production did an obviously slipshod job. I deducted one star for that.	2004-01-12

What others found as complaining, came across as justifiable frustration to me. I skipped over his tangents; the fifth star is subtracted for occasional pomposity.	2003-11-02
US	42814939	R4U3YMXPA5E94	0066211360	431898592	The Adventures of Flash Jackson: A Novel	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Promise not met	I gotta say I was disappointed. Haley of Part One was an interesting character; I was hoping to discover more of her in Part Two. Instead, the story goes in another direction entirely. Now that I've finished the book (and at the risk of giving away the plot too badly), it started going downhill after the grandmother was written out. Moreover, some loose ends are leftover at the conclusion (for example: in Part One, Miss Powell's personal life seems to be loaded with innuendo; in Part Two, she's just sort of \\"there\\" as a secondary character).<BR>The last 25% of the book seemed predictable. I went from \\"She seems kinda neat\\" at the end of Part One to \\"Who cares!\\" at the end of Part Two.	2003-09-23
US	42814939	RNBCEMOK99Y1G	0349116067	384816814	The United Burger States of America	Books	1	5	5	N	N	Disjointed piece of garbage	First of all, I'm re-assured that I wasn't the only one to see this as one long session of America-bashing.  To the rest of the world: we have our problems and stereotypes DO come from somewhere but Biddlecombe just DOESN'T let up for a couple of hundred pages. <br />The book itself is totally disjointed. While not accusing the author of making up many of the episodes, I believe they are probably comically distorted presentations of more ordinary excursions.<br />While not at will willing to let Mr. Biddlecombe off the hook for such a slapdash, condescending \\"work\\", I blame his editors as well.  There are spelling errors (Trentham [sic], New Jersey - which is oddly corrected only once towards the very end of the book. I guess the Brits are too busy being \\"civilized folk\\" to master the global search-and-replace function?) as well as factual ones (Milwaukee as the capital of Wisconsin). If I had to guess, I'd say that this book looked great as a proposal, but the publisher got hornswoggled by the author's burnout; they should've asked for their advance back and cancelled the whole deal.	2003-06-29
US	42814939	RTLDM27CSPQX7	0471414646	709311493	Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self	Books	2	48	54	N	Y	One chapter would suffice	I purchased this book based upon others' online recommendations.<br />Had I seen it on a store bookshelf first, I would have been able to determine that it makes the same point over and over again in each chapter, and skipped it.<br />Had I reserved it from the library without seeing it first, I would probably have stopped reading after a couple of chapters.<br />The distinction between Optimal Thinking and Positive Thinking is well presented at the outset. The rest is filler.	2003-04-11
