This book represents American historical storytelling at it's finest. An absolultely divine page-turner; one of the most profound insights on the Civil War I have read. This book presents history in a compelling manner that is easy to read but still encapsulates the thoughts and emotions comprising the American Civil War. It is beautifully divided into chapters aptly named after the officers they portray. Each character's experiences jump through the reader to give him an understanding of the common themes of the North and the South. Common themes including the reasoning behind the war, specifically slavery or state's rights and family against family, and friend against friend are presented in manner that exonerates the humanity of both points of view. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in American history, military history, American philosophy, or just interesting reading.	2002-09-22

I'm a curious, Southern, white, educated individual with modern thinking who was always curious on this subject. Unfortunately, it is such a antagonistic subject, I couldn't really quell any curiosity. It covered a lot of bases and was good chewing material. It gives some insight into the plight of Black America. The only thing I didn't like was about 1/4 of the content was footnote references. I don't think this is a re-reader, but good pretty good the first time.	2002-06-01

I actually read this after seeing the HBO series. The HBO series is very close to the book. The book has a little more to it. Great docu-movie on WWII following the 101st Airborne.

This book has quite a few errors that I have discussed with colleagues in the field. Some of the errors are facts that were true in previous versions, 7.3 for example, but are no longer applicable. This would probably be caused to the pulling of material from previous PL/SQL versions. All examples I've used worked fine though. The errors are frustrating because I don't know whether to remember the errors for the test, or to give the actual correct answers for the test. An example of an error is that the book states that an ORDER BY clause cannot be used in a sub query, but as of Oracle 8i, this is no longer the case. The practice tests from selftestsoftware.com don't indicate that the errors are even asked, so I am hoping that they are inconsequential. As time goes by, errata will be published on the oraclepress.com website which will correct the errors. I submitted 3 errors last week, but they have not yet been posted as of yet.<br />The good part is that this is an Oracle Press book that is a subset of McGraw-Hill Publishing. Oracle Press has a close relationship with Oracle, so it is the most accurate book for the OCP exams to date. Another plus is that when taking the selftestsoftware.com practice tests, the errors that you made point to subjects that are almost word for word chapters names from this book, so reviewing deficiencies in the test are pretty straight forward. <br />This book is very well written and is easy to understand and is interesting if you are interested in Oracle. The new 9i OCP exams only cover SQL and not PL/SQL, so it's not quite the phone book I was expecting, but it has plenty of material. As all Oracle Press / Osborne books, this is useful for future reference after the OCP exam is passed, and some of the details have been forgotten. If it weren't for the errors, which are inevitable in any first edition from the first publisher of any technical book, I would give it 5 stars. <br />The best methodology I've found for taking any certification exam is to purchase a practice test for the exam, take a calibration test of a small subset (say 20 or 30 questions) then note the errors. Once you find the subjects you need to review, go to the book and read the chapters then take another subset until you get a passing score (it's best to repeat until you get a high score, such as 95% because you are going to memorize some of the questions).	2002-01-28
US	52830838	R1MEM0TV8Y3BOZ	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Great in two aspects	The Great Gatsby is great in two aspects of books that I look for. First is the general story; plot, characterization, setting, storyline. Second is the way it is written which keeps you reading it over and over.<br />The setting is a fictitious New York suburb of East and West Egg in the early 1920's, a location dotted with large estates build with immense wealth. The main characters are the narrator, Nick Caraway; his new found girl and golf pro, Jordan Baker; Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan; and of course James Gatz also known as Jay Gatsby, self prescribed culturist of old wealth.<br />Concerning the first aspect, this book is an art of obsession, treachery, deception, hubris, crime and murder. It is the original soap opera (though not annoyingly melodramatic). It will keep you turning pages and ends with a bang.<br />The second aspect, the one that makes it a classic is the brilliant prose and mastery of the English language. Like a movie that presents something new every time you watch it, this book has many subtle subplots and philosophical outlooks.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading and rereading the classics. A book from \\"the lost generation,\\" written by an author from World War I, it definitely has the era's deserving undertones.	2002-01-16

The cover is very capturing of the era, the binding is top notch, and the high-gloss pages have the look and feel of a top quality book. That's where the high sticker prices comes from. Other than that, this book wasn't very impressive. I bought this book with the full intent of learning of the political and strategic aspects of World War I, but this book made even WAR boring.<br />I bought this with the full understanding that it wouldn't give me a soldier's perspective of the war. I read Death's Men for that. I wanted to get a big picture of WWI including the military tactics, political mindsets, and the chain of events. Though this book has the chain of events, it is shallow as to the why (military tactics and political mindsets) and the chain of evens are written in such a mechanized prose that it is hard to keep reading. This happened... then this happened... then this happened... then this happened...<br />This book reminds me of the classic history textbook, but it is even less encapsulating than that. This book DOES have a good selection of maps and photographs, but I just couldn't get past the mechanized prose. In some sections, the grammar is poor, which I also abhor. I'm going to force myself through the rest of the book after just 80 pages. After the first 2 chapters, I've already lost interest in WWI, which I didn't think was possible after Death's Men.	2002-01-09

Similar to how &quot;The Terminator&quot; scared us about robitics in the 80's. A little long, but very interesting indeed.

The author collected memoirs from British soldiers from WWI and organized them into various chapters: The Kitchener Armies Form, The Training of `Other Ranks', Coming to Terms With The Army, Training the Officers, Over to France, Trench Life,  The Weapons of Trench Warfare, The Strain of Trench Warfare, Into Rest, Home Leave, Battle, After Battle, Attitudes to the Germans, Attitudes to the War as a Whole, and After the War. Though not all of them are superb, all of them are very good. The most gruesome are Trench Life, The Weapons of Trench Warfare, and The Strain of Trench Warfare. After the War was an excellent close up chapter with some great commentary.<br />The entire book is from the British perspective. Though the majority of the Allied soldiers of World War I's Western Front were French, this captures the experience and affects of World War I brilliantly. The picture of the cover is an exquisite choice; all throughout the book I would read horrific things of the war and look at the picture on the cover and think, \\"you poor ...\\" The only negative thing I have to say about this book is the small print. The margins are more than enough to allow a larger print and still fit in the same existing dimensions. There is only one map and the British slang isn't defined, but you can find most of it ... <br />Some of the more gory details concern snipers, machine guns, decomposing body, the deplorable conditions of the trenches, the horrific affects of phosphene gas and mustard gas (and of course tear and chlorine), mortar and artillery fire, and rats. This isn't an action story. Although there is plenty of action in it, it's an accumulation and narration of memoirs of World War I organized in a well manner. I highly recommend this to historian hobbyists, true historians, or people who just like understanding war. It won't be a dissapointment.	2002-01-07

Set in the early 1900's America, this book is about a mother's heroin addiction and the shambles left behind. At a time when drugs were legal, all a woman had to do was go to her pharmacy and order a weekly dose, this book shows the ugliness addiction to this drug can do to a normally dysfunctional family. Whether the family was already dysfunctional is not known, but the mother's addiction most certainly made things worse. A great short play; a quick read.	2002-01-07

It is set in the American Great Depression on a farm. &quot;A Painted House&quot; refers to the luxury of the time when all farm houses were plain wood and only the well off could afford pain for their house. Similar to &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; though not as exceptional, possible because it had already been done by Steinbeck. Very fast read, and reminded me of a family farm in Alabama.

The quick and to the point prose made it easy to read while the dialog was excellent and plentiful. I don't typically give a book 5 stars just because it's considered a classic, but I thought this was very good. The setting is mainly in Italy during World War I. The main characters are Lieutenant Henry, an American ambulance driver in the Italian army and Catherine Berkley, an English Nurse who fall in love. Although this book has a love story as a central theme, it isn't the type that makes me want to retch. It's about people during WWI who happen to fall in love. It goes into philosophical detail on both war and love and the interesting juxtaposition love and war are.	2002-01-02

The Grapes of Wrath is a work of art that irradiates such movement.

Studies concentrated on the evils of the German side of the Axis powers while the Japanese atrocities were brushed over, probably out of general American guilt for using the bomb and the unfathomable carnage of the Nazi concentration camps. This book tells the story of just a small section of the Pacific Theatre with total regard for the brutal accuracy of the Japanese at the time. I asked a fellow scholar to read the epilogue and after reading he said, \\"I can't read this book, it makes me want to go out and kill Japanese.\\" He was being facetious of course, but it gives you an idea of the realism this book delves the reader. Make no mistake; because this book is non-fiction, it was a bit depressing. After reading this, I started with the Hobbit; a little lighter reading to ease my sense of humanity.	2001-12-30

I've been awaiting the release of this book for quite a while (It was announced a year before release then was late). When it finally came in the mail the other day, I dove right into it. About halfway through, I'd say this is a pretty good book. It covers all the essentials that are built in to Solaris. I am reading it cover to cover and taking notes in a file. Although it doesn't cover complex 3rd party apps, like BIND, it does cover smaller 3rd party products, such as ssh. It does cover Solaris in and of itself pretty well and I am learning a lot.

This book is decent as a language reference, but when it comes to a conceptual reference, it falls a little short. The first 3rd is the conceptual part. The latter portion is the language reference - goes over  objects and commands and such. I was hoping for a little more from a  desktop reference. If I were to only buy one book, it would be from Marco  Cantu.	2000-07-13

It definitely keeps the frustration levels down when you first power up the box and can't get it connected to the network. It assumes you  know how to implement NT with TCP/IP and is very brief and to the point. It  doesn't cover much - only the basics to get you started, but what do you  expect for 140+ pages? I liked it because I didn't have to read endless  yammering to get something done. I gave it 4 stars because it is just a bit  pricy for the content, but still great. It's formatted like -<br />This is how  you do it in NT: Bla bla bla.<br />This is the Solaris Way: Bla bla bla.	2000-07-13

Unfortunately, unless it was about 8,000 pages long, it wouldn't be a perfect reference. I DO use it when my other Oracle books don't give me enough information (i.e.  DBA Handbook and ORA8 PL/SQL). I think this one also comes with a CD of the  contents in digital form. VERY handy reference material.	2000-07-13

This book is a monster, which I usually despise; but Marco Cantu chose his words effectively and descriptively. Most everything I've looked for I've found in this book. It's a bit heavy, but definitely worth carrying around  as a reference. It's the best Delphi reference book I've found so far. I  wouldn't recommend reading it cover to cover, but look through the table of  contents and pick the chapters you're most interested in. The index is  useful as well.	2000-07-13

The title describes this book perfectly. It is another brief and to the point book that covers a lot of material. I hate it when authors / publishers try to publish phone books of endless bla bla to get it to sell,  but this one is only around 500 pages. It goes over many of the basic but  essential 'solutions' such as POP servers, SECURITY, backups and restores,  DNS, permissions, etc. It's not the end all be all book for Solaris, but  it's pretty good. I gave it 5 stars because of the content and the price.	2000-07-13

This book is geared more towards implementing an existing design onto an Oracle database rather than how to design a good warehouse then implement it into Oracle. Its very adept at what it does, I just wish it went over  more design theory.	2000-07-13

It is organized so poorly that I felt stupid because I didn't understand what they were talking about. It's this type of book that gives the C++ learning curve a bad name. I have since found some other excellent  books and have picked it right up. C++ isn't difficult to learn at all if  you have the right resources.	2000-07-13

A year and a half ago, I was thrown into a situation where I had to do reporting, data mining and EDI feeds for a MASSIVE UGLY system containing 1400 tables some with over 5 million rows. I  didn't have ANY Oracle experience (Just Access *HA!* and SQL Server *Double  HA!*) I cranked out this book in 3 days and after a week or so of practice,  I was the master.	2000-07-13

Though the &quot;Visual C++ Blue Book&quot; explained it well, OOP is such a 'core competency' or  'fundamental' I felt I needed a little extra understanding on these  concepts of C++. This book did an excellent job of explaining the core  concepts of OOP as it relates to C++. Since it is short, I didn't get bored  with the endless yammering of many authors. It was quick, consice, and yet  somehow managed to be extremely thurough. I highly recommend this book to  anyone even though it recommends itself to C programmers moving to C++. I'm  from VB, ASP and was able to grasp all of the concepts. Buy it, it will  make you a better programmer.	2000-05-14

I am a seasoned VB / ASP developer who was interested in taking my ASP sites to the next level with C++ (VB just doesn't cut it with COM) but was always intimidated by the  cryptic syntax of C++. Reading poorly written books like 'Learn C++ Now'  didn't help at all. Reading this book gave me a grasp on what's going on  with all that funky code. It gives detailed explanations for almost every  line. Definately a good 'first book' for C++ beginners. It won't scare you  away from the language.	2000-04-19
