Not so with the Miles Vorkosigan series because Bujold allows her characters to grow and change with their experiences.  In the last book, Miles nearly lost his life but thanks to the miracles of medicine he has another shot at serving his world however, there are after effects of that resurrection. Miles comes face to face with limitations, limitations that could change is life radically. Meanwhile, on Barrayar changes are occuring that set in motion a chain of events that will change the face of ImpSec for years to come.<br /><br />Not much more can be said without spoiling the book for you.  However, there is a starkness to this book that causes the reader as well as Miles to evaluate the meaning of honor, justice, reward, and punishment.  Can we be true to ourselves if we are false to those around us? Does the end justify the means as long as we get what we want in the end? What are you willing to trade for your hearts desire? The passionate wanting of Miles to serve is so strong you just bleed for him in this no holds barred novel  where Miles faces temptation and must solve a mystery to save a friend.	2005-10-13

I've read it four times now and each time I gain a greater respect for Bujold's ability to tell a compelling story.  This is a difficult book to review because there is just so much going on.  The basic plot review is that Mark is back and plans to take Miles' place with the Dendarii and save at least some clones from death.  However, Mark forgot one thing--he isn't Miles and doesn't have his experience and knowledge base.  Mark also failed to recognize Miles loyalty to a brother he has never know and to his troops.  Mark also learns the hard way that people are not things and there are consequences to all actions. <br /> <br />Miles and Mark each make mistakes, misunderstand, and flounder about trying to do the right things in a situation that has no simple answers.  In the end, they each learn more about themselves then about each other but at least there's a mutual respect and a willingness to try to be family. <br /> <br />This is truly a book that you'll have a hard time putting down.  The action is fast paced, the plot threads are extremely tight, interwoven, and multi-leveled.  It's staggering that all this is told in one novel.  I laughed I cried and found myself trying to get the characters to listen to reason but alas they are already written and in the end all you can do is read on and hope that the end of the book is worth the joy and pain of the reading..  Brothers in Arms built up to this novel and Mirror Dance is a supreme payoff.	2005-10-13

Admiral Naismith has just come into Earth orbit with ships that need refitting, injured and dead crew that need medical care, and the Cetagandan hit squads hopefully lost behind. The Dendarii need their pay for the horrendously expensive jail break they just performed (See Borders of Infinity).  He needs money and to check in with the Barrayaran Embassy.    The usual benign beginning turns into intrigue when the Embassy Security doesn't even know Naismith is owed money, his calls for money to his usual sources are unanswered, he's confined to quarters, the Dendarii are at loose ends and getting in trouble, these a plot afoot to kidnap him, a report thinks Naismith and Vorkosigan are the same person, and Ivan is working at the Embassy.     In this book we get an introduction to Galeni and to Lord Mark. There is a lot going on in this book.  There's not only the story of the book but much of the background and history that will feature in the next several books is laid in this one.    If your looking for a book to take your mind of your life for a few hours--this is it.  There's action, intrigue, plot twists, and the usual wit and humor.  At least I know I wouldn't mind a living fur blanket that purrs providing I wasn't allergic to it.    Read and enjoy.	2005-10-06

Miles and Ivan are the Barrayarian envoys to the funeral of the Cetagandian Empress.  They barely reach the transfer station above Cetaganda when they are boarded and attacked...or are they. From this minor incident, Miles finds himself in the middle of intrigue that could kill him, cause Barrayar to be plunged into war, and destabilize the Cetagandan Empire.  Moreover, Miles also learns that Barrayar's intelligence network is not always seeing the world as it is as he learns that the haut women of Cetaganda are more than merely decorative beauties in a bubble. <br /> <br />There's non-stop action as the tensions build and the plot thickens. We learn more about Ivan and Miles and their interactions with others.  It's the usual Bujold book filled with action, adventure, well-drawn characters, and told with wit and humor.	2005-10-05

However, once I started reading it was hard to stop.  Told entirely in letters between two cousins (Kate and Cecelia) it takes a while to get going but thereafter it's a wild romp. <br /> <br />Kate is nearly killed by poisoned chocolate by a wizard who mistakes her for someone else. Cecelia wishes she could be in London for the season with Kate but she's stuck in the country where someone seems to be following her and her friend Dorothea can't seem to be in the same room with a man without him falling all over himself to get into her favour. <br /> <br />The two cousins letters seem unconnected in their happenings but it soon becomes apparent to all that the stories are intertwined and they have to work together one in the city and one in the country to solve the mysteries that abound and to save their friends and relatives from some awful magical punishments.	2005-10-04

We start with a the return of a woman everyone thought had been buried 3 1/2 years ago.  Her husband says it isn't her but other feel it would be terrible if you can home and no one wanted you any more. It seems a simple case of mistaken identity so long ago but it's the middle of WWII and things are never that simple. <br /> <br />Miss Silver and DS Frank Abbott think there's more going on with the death of a woman from the country, the mistaken identity, and the German spy network.   <br /> <br />It's a quick read and the story is well laid out and the personalities all ring true in their confusion, anger, love, and hates.  Rather more intricate plotting than in some other of Miss Siler mysteries.	2005-10-04

Krynwall falls to an unknown wizard and his dark forces. Queen Ellebe escapes to seek help. And we begin reading thinking this is the usual quest story - find the sword, kill the wizard, and all will be right with the world again. But is anything ever that simple? <br /> <br />Jarom has grown up in the simple forest village of Diln. He's the village Fason or peacekeeper and the only son of the head of the village Elders. But after Jarom and his best friend, Allion, save Queen Ellebe from her pursuers, they are locked out of the Elder's deliberations. When Jarom is finally allowed into the chamber it is to have his world torn apart and turned upside down. He learns that he is Torin, son of Ellebe and King Sorl and  he is expected to go to a neighboring kingdom and raise an army to save the kingdom before the wizard can consolidate his power. <br /> <br />Jarom feels he has no choice but to agree to this scheme and he and Allion set off. But there is more to being a king than being birthed by the Queen. While Jarom has been trained all his life to be a leader and to settle disputes, he feels adrift as the underpinnings of his world are shifted and his place in it changed. He refuses his new name and reluctantly realizes that he must do what he can for the people. But without his identity as Jarom, he struggles to gain solid footing in this new reality he finds himself in. <br /> <br />While the quest is outwardly a search for the Crimson Sword of Asahiel, the true quest is Jarom's search to find himself and his place in the world. Can he be a leader of men? Can he become a King? Does he want to be King? <br /> <br />Along the journey, Jarom meets with others who help, hinder, confuse, advise, challenge, love, and skew his worldview. There's a lot going on in this book: high adventure, love, friendship, meddling wise men, and monstrous demons. There's something for everyone as Jarom strives to save his village, the kingdom, and discover himself. The big surprise for me is that while this is book one of a trilogy, it can and does stand-alone. <br /> <br />What's even more surprising is that this is a first novel. Eldon Thompson has written a different quest story that has enough twists and turns to entertain even the most jaded fantasy reader. There are some rough spots as Jarom whines about his fate and acts as if the world owes him something for being different than what he believed it to be. Seeing the control this author has over the material indicates that as his skills grow with the next book, the story should gain even more depth and twistedness.	2005-08-23

That night Shad wakes as Mags tries to reach him through his cell door. The other prisoners are awake and watchful but no one will talk to him. The fury inside him is awake and spoiling for revenge. November Mourns starts with a question: Who killed Shad Jenkins' sister Megan? It ends leaving you with many more questions than you started with but somehow satisfied, even though the hairs on the back of your neck might not lie down for a while. <br /> <br />From the first page, I found myself drawn into the story. The story hangs together but it's so convoluted, twisted, and just plain weird that it's hard to sort things out. Finally, you find yourself just going with it. Shad talks to his dead mother and her various companions when he night walks. His sister, or mostly her hand, seems to be directing Shads investigations as he sees her gesturing to him out of the corner of his eye. <br /> <br />Shads father has never recovered from the death of Shads mother. Then Megan's mother ran away to marry her own cousin. The relationships in this book are often convoluted since everyone in town seems to be related in several degrees to everyone else in town. Moonshine running is the biggest industry and most everyone is addicted to moonshine in one way or another. Shad, after drying out in prison, can taste the moonshine on the air and understands the hunger but won't give in to the temptation because finding out what happened to Megan takes priority. <br /> <br />From the beginning the plot is multi-threaded and convoluted. We begin to get glimpses of the town, its people, and Shad as he searches for answers. It's a quest story but not in the usual sense. Shad is looking to find the murderer but he's also looking to find himself. Prison has changed him, but can he resist getting pulled back into this town and its own history and story. Shad has a part to play but will he discover what that part is before it takes him over.	2005-08-23

Continuing the story, Rachel still has the demon mark to worry about, a boyfriend who is scared to be anywhere near her, a vampire business partner who wants to be more (and who has fallen off the 'just say no' to blood wagon), a vampire who wants to have a relationship, a powerful man who has a connection to her past and who she doesn't trust, and now someone is moving in to fill the vacancy in the criminal underground made when Rachel brought down Piscary. It's a wild mix of conflicting loyalties, changing relationships between the major characters, and the fight between good, evil, and the lesser evil. <br /> <br />Harrison fleshes out her world even more. In the process of reading the story you get a feel for the totality of the environment. Thoughtful touches include hibernation sickness that effects pixies who like warm weather and hibernate in the cold, caps for vampire teeth so they can be 'safe' to attend mixed events, music with vampire tracks that humans can't hear. It all makes the world believable and complex. <br /> <br />Then there is the mystery. Who is moving in and killing residents of the homeless shelters? Who is taking over the crime vacancy left vacant by Piscary's arrest and imprisonment? While on a \\"date\\" to provide cover for a friend (Kristen) as he visits a gambling boat Rachel checks out the security and meets and interesting man. On a second visit, she and Kristen barely escape with their lives. Now she has to solve the mystery and purchase her solstice gifts, make up with Jenks, and get rid of the demon trying to pull her into the ever-after. <br /> <br />The trick is to do all this without loosing her partners and her friends. Life isn't easy for Rachel, but then it never is if you really care not only for the people in your life but for the ones you don't know personally. Rachel makes a lot of discoveries about herself and finds she needs to understand Rachel before she can fix the world of its ills. <br /> <br />If you've liked her other books you'll love this one. If you haven't read the previous books, what are you waiting for? Start with Dead Witch Walking.	2005-08-23

Brenden Vetch has spent most of his life learning to listen to the plants and growing things in the mountains of his home. Then he learned loss: loss of his father and his mother to death, many villagers to a fever, his brother to roaming to forget his losses, and his girlfriend to inattention. But Od showed up one day and invited Brenden to come and care for the gardens in her School of Magic. He finds the door to the school under the sign of the shoe in the capitol city of Numis, Kelior.  <br /> <br />Brenden Vetch considers himself a gardener. A better than average gardener, he'll grant you but nothing special - definitely not a magician. However, Brenden comes into the School of Magic by way of the door under the sign of the shoe. It's been years since anyone has come to the school by that door. Only Od has ever sent students to that entry. Wizard Yar is called by magic and meets Brenden as he enters the school. Yar sends him to the garden and decides to keep him a secret, at least for a while, for Brenden insists he isn't a wizard. <br /> <br />Od founded the School of Magic centuries ago. With the founding of the school a war was ended. Sponsored by the King, the school which was attached to the castle as a way to see that all who had talent were trained appropriately. Untrained magical users in the kingdom are killed or banished, because of the danger of an untrained magic user loose among the people. <br /> <br />But, in Od Magic, we quickly learn that what we see is not necessarily what is true and that truth is often not only not seen, but denied. Students of the school and wizards are banned from entering the Twilight Quarter of the city. In the Twilight Quarter, day is night and night is day and anything can and does seem to happen when Tyramin the trickster entertains. The King demands to know if Tyramin is a wizard or simply a sleight of hand artist. But, Tyramin is harder to pin down than water in a stream. Arneth, the Warden for that area of the city, isn't even sure Tyramin exists. <br /> <br />The characters and plot elements separate and twine about each other confusing the reader, not that the plot is vague or confusing, but that the confusion of the reader is intentional in order to keep us from seeing more than the characters. We learn as we read and we are in some way a part of the story not just the reader of the book. The language and phrasing are so rich, you find yourself drawn in and spellbound until the last page is read.	2005-08-23

It's sort of like the old joke about the blind men each trying to describe an elephant when they each had only a small piece of the animal in their grip. No one essay can be expected to give you a definitive answer as to what the Hitchhiker's Guide is truly about or what Douglas Adams' message was when he wrote it. What the essays do is give you an understanding of why the books are so popular and how so many people have found a place for them in their lives and hearts. <br /> <br />Some of these essays had me laughing out loud so that I had to read those parts to my husband to prove I hadn't really gone off the deep end. Other's had me wondering about how you could come up with such serious connections from a series of comedic science fiction books. Then there were the essays that had me saying, \\"hmm, never thought of that\\". And of course, being me, there were the essays that had me sniffling discreetly into a tissue. There's a lot to like in this collection of essays. However, they are essays rather than short stories and if you're looking for the latter this book is not for you. <br /> <br />Mike Byrne in \\"Beware of the Leopard\\", Cory Doctorow in \\"Wikipedia: A Genuine H2G2 - Minus the Editor, and Bruce Bethke in \\" The Secret Symbiosis: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Its Impact on Real Computer Science\\" talk about the impact that Hitchhiker's Guide has had on computer science, computer interface design, the internet as a communications media, and the impetus it was in starting many young people on a career in the sciences. The Guide in the television version, while done with colored gels and press on letters was heads and shoulders above what computers at the time were capable of achieving. Once people saw what a really good user interface could be like they demanded better than theyhad and the computer companies listened. In some ways, we have Douglas Adams to thank for the usability of computers because once users began to think there could be something better they demanded it. <br /> <br />Others see the Hitchhiker's Guide as a round about way to think of the truly important things in life: religion, humor, 42, looking at the world as it is. The following essays dealt more with the philosophical aspects of the books: \\"That About Wraps it up for Oolon Colluphid\\" by Don Debrandt; \\"The Holy Trilogy\\" by Selina Rosen (this one is so funny it should have a spew alert); \\"The Zen of 42\\" by Marie-Catherine Caillava. <br /> <br />No book about the Guide could be complete without a mention of Vogon poetry. Lawrence Watt-Evans in \\"A Consideration of Certain Aspects of Vogon Poetry\\" discusses the merits of quantifying poetry so that the Guide can equivocally say that Vogon poetry is the third worst. He also wonders about Arthur's seeming immunity to it. <br /> <br />Adam Roberts in \\"42\\" and Jacqueline Carey in \\"Yes, I Got It\\" discuss the philosophy of humor and its place in our lives. While Susan Sizemore in \\"You Can't Go Home Again, Damn It! Even If Your Planet Hasn't Been Blown Up by Vogons\\" realizes that the person she was when first exposed to the Guide and the person she is now do not view the Guide in the same way. Even with all the happy memories of that first reading, she finds that it doesn't have the same impact now as it did then. <br /> <br />Food, food, glorious food. Douglas Adams loved a good meal especially with good friends and food plays an important role in the Hitchhiker's Guide. The role of food is touched upon by Steven Baxter in \\"Lunching at the Eschaton: Douglas Adams and the End of the Universe in Science Fiction\\", A.M. Dellamonica in \\"Digital Watches May Be a Pretty Neat Idea, But Peanuts and Beer Are What Get You Through the Apocalypse\\". <br /> <br />When the world or universe is off kilter or just plain crazy, how do you remain sane when all about you are crazy? Well, some writers have evidently come up with some ideas on how to remain sane in a crazy world from their reading of the Guide: \\"The Subversive Dismal Scientist: Douglas Adams and the Rule of Unreason\\" by Vox Day; \\"Another Fine Mess\\" by Adam Troy Castro; \\"The Only Sane Man in the Universe\\" by Marguerite Krause; \\"Douglas Adams and the Wisdom of Madness\\" by John Shirley; and \\"Loop-Surface Security: The Image of the Towel in a Vagabond Universe - A Semiotic (Semi-Odd) Excursion\\" by Mark W. Tiedemann. <br /> <br />There's also an interview with Douglas Adam by John Shirley (\\"A Talk with Douglas Adams\\"). Amy Berner in \\"Words to Live \\" talks about how everything she needed to learn to life live she learned from the Hitchhiker's Guide. \\"Goodnight, Marvin\\" by Maria Alexander is the final essay in the book and a touching tribute to Douglas as a person who touched many of our lives with his writing.	2005-08-23

Up to now her biggest problem was sneaking a snack without her mother the nutritionist finding out. Tonight was special, Nixie's best friend, Linnie, was staying over. Nixie tried to wake her to sneak an Orange Fizzy, but Linnie wouldn't get up. The Orange Fizzy saved Nixie's life. <br /> <br />They were totally silent when the came through the house and killed Nixie's parents, brother, her best friend and the housekeeper. But they missed Nixie because she wasn't where she should have been and Linnie died in her place. Lt. Eve Dallas is assigned the case and she has no DNA, no fingerprints, no clues. What she has is a nine-year-old eye-witness who didn't panic and just might be the key to solving the case. <br /> <br />Survivor in Death is the twentieth book of the In Death series by J.D. Robb, a pseudonym for Nora Roberts who is generally known for her romance novels. (Those of you who have read the other books of this series may skip the rest of this paragraph.) The In Death books take place in New York City; this time it's the year 2059. Lt. Eve Dallas, NYPSD Homicide, is the central character in each of these murder mysteries. Eve is a cop through and through - it's not a job, it's who she is. In each book, we see the growth of the continuing characters usually with each new book picking up within a few weeks of the end of the last book. <br /> <br />In this book, Eve Dallas is faced with a witness to a murder. Nixie is nine-years-old and she managed to survive and keep her head. It was Nixie who called the police after witnessing the death of the housekeeper. But when Eve looks at Nixie, she sees herself - a child alone, covered in blood, escaping a nightmare. But Eve must get past that if she's to stand for the dead and find the killers. <br /> <br />Eve relies even more heavily on her partner, Peabody, and her husband, Roarke, and his resources. As with most of the novels the plot is intricately and skillfully woven. In twenty novels I've only guessed the killer once and that wasn't until I got to almost the half way point. Since I often figure out the killer by chapter four, I really enjoy a book where I can speculate along with the sleuth about 'who-done-it'. <br /> <br />Beyond the plot, the society of 2059 is recognizable as an extrapolation of our own. Smoking is against the law everywhere. Machines sell only nutritious snacks and chastise you if you indulge too often in sweets. Eve can't use the machines in Cop Central because she's been banned for abusing them so she has to get other officers to buy for her. The NYC vendors sell tofu on a stick. Most homes have AutoChef that cooks your meals for you. Cars can fly. You can travel to Europe for an evening out (if you have the money). There are also off-world colonies and resorts. <br /> <br />Of course, there are still the problems of terrorism, fanaticism, and just plain meanness. Not all the cops are good and Eve Dallas is not shy about routing out the bad ones. Eve's personal growth throughout the series is consistent with what is happening in the plots. And since the author is also a romance writer there are some steamy scenes between Roarke and Eve. There's lots for the fan of hard-boiled mysteries to like in these books, especially since the usual hard-boiled mystery doesn't have a female lead. Oh, and for the fans of the series, a spoiler of sorts, we still don't know who is stealing Dallas' candy out of her office.	2005-08-23

And when Roe and Martin return from a dinner party gone wrong they find a dead body on their stairs, Regina missing, and the baby asleep under the bed, and a stranger asleep under the couch.  And that's only the beginning. <br /> <br />As usual, Charlaine Harris delivers a witty mystery filled with enough twists to make you dizzy.  She also manages to deal with the problems of remarriage and their extended families, family inter-relationships, the conflict of not being able to have what you want and the dangers of looking for the easy way out of your problems.  There are a lot of issues here and the ending is not your usual happy one but it is satisfying in its way.	2005-08-16

All five are headstrong and opinionated and not at all to the liking of Fitzwilliam who finds them too out-spoken for their own good while not lacking in looks or manners. <br /> <br />With a residence in London, loose control and the season just starting the temptations are too much for Georgina and Belle who are empty-headed and in love with the thought of lovers and drama.  It's Lydia all over again (and she has a small part in this book).   <br /> <br />There are lots of secondary plots and the usual comedy of manners.  It's a well paced and written tribute to the original book and a resonable sequel.	2005-08-09

Since her parents were actors and the murder extremely vicious, it was big news and Olivia was the only witness.  Her grandparents took her in and raised her in Washington state, out of the limelight and away from reporters.  But Olivia never forgot that night or the cop who was so nice to her. <br /> <br />The book intercuts Olivia's life with Noah Brady's, the son of the cop who found her hiding in the closet.  Their lives intersect several times as Olivia grows up.  Noah becomes a writer of true crime books and Olivia a naturalist. <br /> <br />Then Sam Tanner, Olivia's father, gets out of prison and finally the story takes off and becomes intense.  Olivia must face her monster and the fears she's always carried with her.  Noah must reach into himself and discover who he is and what he wants as well.   <br /> <br />It's slow starting out but about a third of the way through it finally hits its stride and the tension builds until the last page.  The mystery is tight and well-plotted as usual and the romance is an added benefit.	2005-07-22

She and her husband begin by giving a dinner for their friends on their first night. However, Julienne (Carolyn's best friend) and Nils quarrel and Julienne disappears. <br /> <br />The rest of the book is how Carolyn tries to find her friend but no one else takes Julienne's disappearance seriously.  Not even Nils (Julienne's husband).  Carolyn learns that she can't report a missing person to the police only the husband can and not for 48 hours.  Thus begins the adventure.  Carolyn gets mugged several times, eats lots of wonderful food, makes daily trips to the police station making the aquaintance of a very handsome officer.  But no one takes her seriously because no one sees the muggings and the police think she's faking for attention. <br /> <br />The receipes throughout make your mouth water.  The atmosphere of New Orleans makes me want to visit.  However, I guessed the murder about half way thorough the book.  Enjoy the background and characters and the descriptions of food.

She has an boring day job and the usual ordinary mother/daughter interactions, and sibling rivalries, and problems.  One of those problems is not having enough money so Jane moonlights selling naughty lingerie, massage oils, and adult playthings.  Then one night on the way home from presenting a Realm of Pleasure party, she blows a tire and hits a rabbit on the highway.   <br /> <br />Knocked unconscious, Jane awakes to strangely dressed strangers dragging her out of the car.  Jane insists they save her boxes and they barely get everything out before the car blows up.  Jane then finds she's not in a highway ditch but in a forest glade.  Her rescuers are not quite human and she accused of murdering the rabbit who happens to be a shape-shifter.  Oh, and did I forget, she's gone through a portal and this isn't even Earth. <br /> <br />Jane deals with all this weirdness with wit, humor, quotes from TV, and all the courage she can muster.  While waiting for her trial, she learns about this world and the Dymynsh (a slow wasting of the world causing barrenness to the world and it's people).  Jane makes friends, enemies, and begins to care for those she's met especially her elf lawyer, Charlie. <br /> <br />It's a well-told tale, with a heroine that you don't have to be ashamed of.  Jane may not have all the answers but she knows right from wrong and does her best to live up to her ideals even if they could cost her life.  It's a fun romp from start to finish.	2005-04-10

Kate Jasper keeps finding bodies.  In fact, she thinks she's karmically impared because every time she enters a crowded room, someone dies.  Perhaps she shouldn't have confided this fear to her best friend Barbara Chu, a medium.  But Barbara knows her well and understands how Kate doesn't want to find bodies.  Kate wants a normal life with her significant other, Wayne.  Barbara tries to cheer Kate up and talks her into going to a psychic meeting at a friend's home for advice.  Kate goes and when the crowd of psychics gathers for a physic exercise the quiet is broken for Kate because when the blindfolds come off there is a dead body.  One of the physics was killed while they were all sitting in the same room. <br /> <br />You'd think a room full of physics could immediately finger the guilty party; after all, they are physics.  But, Kate learns that not all physics are real.  That riding in a car with Barbara could get you killed.  That even bed-ridden, Wayne might just figure out that she found a new body and must find the killer before the police think she did it. <br /> <br />The story is interesting, convoluted and the murderer is not guessable but once you know who you can see the clues throughout the book.  The tension rises as the bodies pile up and Kate realizes that she must find the killer because the next body could be hers.   <br /> <br />Kate is witty, intelligent, and not your average amateur sleuth.  She doesn't want to find bodies she just wants a normal life.  Thought with her friends, I don't think that's possible. <br /> <br />Great book to while away a rainy day.	2005-04-10

Paige is a witch and she took on the responsibility of raising Savannah Levine.  Savannah is just coming into her teens and is already more powerful than many of the Coven that Paige leads.  But does Paige really run the Coven?  The Coven Elders make decisions and try to get Paige to toe their line - don't make waves and don't get noticed.   <br /> <br />Then Paige gets noticed when Savannah's father tries to get custody of her using Leah, the half-demon, who tried to manipulate Savannah while she was a captive in the last book.  Paige needs a lawyer.  The human lawyer she hires turns out to be more trouble and now she has a Cabal lawyer, Cortez, who seems to show up whenever she's accused of a crime saying he is her lawyer.   <br /> <br />It's a page-turner.  Savannah at 13 often seems far older than Paige who can't or won't accept that she can never meet the expectations of the Coven Elders.  Finally, Paige must learn to trust herself and her abilities.  This realization takes us through many crisis situations as Paige and Savannah learn to trust each other.  I believe that there is a lot of material that Armstrong can work with over many more books.	2005-04-10

While Austen purists will hate this book I'm sure, it's one possible follow on to the story so many of us love.  How many people who have read Pride & Prejudice or seen the mini-series have wondered what happened after the book finished or the credits ran off the screen?  Berdoll takes a run at showing us the ever after of this fairy tale.  The author tries to stay with the language and style of Austen's book but soon it becomes difficult to wade through and some of the convolutions are actually funny. <br /> <br />It's also obvious that this is based on the mini-series rather than the book, as many of the characters are continuations of the series rather than having the characteristics assigned to them by Austen.  The book is rather choppy as the story moves along and then backs up to fill in the missing segments from a chapter or more back.  The central romance of Elizabeth and Darcy hums along and whenever the plot slows there is a steamy sex scene to fill up our time while waiting for the plot to get off break and come back on track. <br /> <br />The book is an interesting continuation of the original story.  It's got most of the characters from the book and in some ways it's a wish fulfillment book since it sees some characters saved from their mistakes or errors in judgment.  While it definitely is not Austen or even a true continuation of Pride and Prejudice, it is enjoyable on the level of an overblown period romance with modern sensibilities and a visit with characters we enjoyed knowing in the original book. <br /> <br />Enjoy it for what it is, a fan fiction wish fulfillment novel.	2005-04-10

Roxy thinks Joy's current boyfriend is boring and Joy would be better off without him.  Joy, who is very tall, thinks any man who would want her is an abnormal one and since she found one she should stick with him, even if he is dull as dishwater. <br /> <br />But after attending a conference in Germany, the women set out to find Roxy a Moravian (vampire), uncover the identity of the writer of her vampire love stories and get all her copies signed, and to find Joy's soul mate.  What they find is adventure, as Joy begins to have frightening visions of a vampire and evil, meets a sexy security man (Raphael), a creepy vampire want-to-be who runs a Goth-faire, a scary tarot card reader/black witch and her sister, and the tale of murders in every town the faire visits. <br /> <br />Not bad up to here, but this is where you need to park your brain. Joy who up to now seemed very resourceful and intelligent becomes unable to think things through to a logical conclusion and behaves erratically.  Roxy who seemed a bit flakey but otherwise okay turns into a brainless child who has no control over her impulses and curiosity.  She totally ignores danger and gets Joy in trouble over and over and can't understand Joy's exasperations with her. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the mystery of the deaths is a constant thread that holds the book together.  Most of the surprises -- Who is the reclusive writer of the vampire romances? Who is the real vampire? Who is Joy's 'true' soul mate? Will Roxy ever catch a clue? Who is the murderer? -- aren't that difficult to figure out. Most readers may miss the specifics that led who to do what but they'll have pegged the answers way before the end of the book.   <br /> <br />But in spite of the draw backs, it is a fun read if you don't look for more than an evening of entertainment and some outrageous and outrageously funny sex scenes, and some laughs. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-13

Taylor is the first in a series which introduces vampire, Deirdre Griffin.  Griffin is a top fashion designer with a definite style.  She's got a good life for a vampire.  No one knows her secret except for her one time lover, Max Hunter.  Max owns a popular nightclub and sets Deirdre up with a 'blood donor' each week.  Things are easy for Deirdre who refuses to kill for blood.  Then suddenly her donors start dying and the trail leads to her.  She now knows there is at least one other vampire in the city and she hopes it is the one who made her so she can kill him. <br /> <br />However Deirdre, while having a large collection of vampire books and films, seems to know little about the myths and legends and even less about her own powers.  She think she knows the people around her but pays them little attention and ignores them to the point of being dangerous to her own survival.   <br /> <br />The love interest between Deirdre and the detective working the murder case is a bit predictable.  I'm hoping that as the series goes on the dynamics between the characters gathers depth. <br /> <br />Deirdre is a likeable character but frustrating in her willful ignorance.  The reader is likely to figure out who the murder is very early in the book and spend the rest of the book wishing Deirdre would catch a clue.  The writing is compelling enough that you keep reading to the end.  I'm even looking forward to the sequel.	2004-10-25

The title is supposed to imply that there is a crossing of southern literature and the literature of the fantastic which includes science fiction, fantasy, horror and other subgenres. <br /> <br />In reading the book, I found that most of the stories (14) are not particularly southern.  You could exchange the town/city name for any town/city of the US and it wouldn't change the story or it's atmosphere.  It's more a book of US stories rather than southern stories.  However, several of the stories had a very southern flavor such as A Plate of Mojo by Honore Fanonne Jeffers and Houston 1943 by Gene Wolfe.  <br /> <br />Many of the stories were light on the fantastical element.  A Plate of Mojo by Honore Fanonne Jeffers, while an outstanding southern story had no fantastical elements other than an off-hand mention of a crow that belonged to the main characters mother.  The Wounded by Richard Butner seemed to be a nod to Lovecraft; but it was missing the ambiguous feeling of fear and lacked focus. Alabama by Kalamu ya Salaam, wasn't really a story at all but an essay on justice and murder/suicide in the south. Interesting and well done but not really fantastical. <br /> <br />The stories that best displayed the elements of the fantasic included Houston 1943 by Gene Wolfe where a young boy is pulled out of his body by voodoo and tries to get his body back. Rose by Bret Lott is a creepy horror story of a lonely woman who seeks love in an unusual way. Michael Bishop's The Yukio Mishima Cultural Association of Kudzu Valley, Georgia is a hilarious romp where a careless remark causes a series of events to increasingly spin out of control.  Mankind Journeys Through Forests of Symbols by Fred Chapell deals with dreams that become reality and the problems that can cause a small town police force.  The Mikado's Favorite Song by Marian Moore plays with the theme of the path not taken crossing the path you take in life. <br /> <br />The stories are all worth reading.  However, if you buy the book actually expecting fantastical, southern literature you will be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you just want to read well told tales with plot and characters whether they be southern or fantastical then you'll probably enjoy this book.	2004-10-15

It starts out very interesting -- part of the world has been replaced with what appears to be a section of an alternate Earth with similar topology but which  developed differently.  But then everything sort of warps around and we're  really in a 'computer' simulated Earth inside a galactic archive that has  what sounds like sentient computer bugs that want a life of their own even  though nothings real anyway.<br />There's still a lot of interesting ideas and  characters thoughout the book and it held my interest enough that I didn't  give up reading it.  I found the characters richly drawn but unbelievable  in their actions and reactions and the plot so unconnected to my world and  my concerns that I didn't care.  Now science fiction is usually removed  from my life and cares but there is a core area of humanity or relatedness  that even so I care about what happens.  So what if the bugs won -- none of  it was going to make a difference anyway.  The real Earth didn't exist and  neither did any of these 'people' who were already dead in the simulation  and only existed because of a malfunction caused by the 'bugs'.  So what  was in the balance?  Why should we care?  What did we learn about ourselves  or our relationship with our planet?  Not much.  But we could have.  There  was a lot here that was interesting and thought provoking but for some  reason it just didn't gel.	1999-05-21

This book has so much in it: first contact, Gaia, Jungian psychology, solid characters you care about,  recovered memory theory, and much more.  Yet he manages to weave a coherent  story that pulls you in and keeps you interested and reading.   <br /> The  failing of the book as in several others by this author is that the end  sort of fizzles.  While the ending fits it's usally a quick pulling  together of the plot threads that leaves the reader sort of feeling let  down after the richness of the rest of the story.	1999-05-21

I found this book interesting -- it hung together as a mystery/murder investigation by a cop who can't be bought.  The mix of murder, missing person, disease/plague, cut-throat business tactics, lack of basic medical  for almost everyone, red-tape, character interactions keeps you reading.   Sometimes just when you think you have it all figured out it skews by 90  degrees. <br /> I did have a problem with so many characters that seemed to  pay bills, live in apartments but have no visible means of support and be  always available to the main characters when needed.  I can suspend belief  but I do wonder about how people can get along without working maybe it's  wishful thinking.	1999-03-05

Once I decided that this was an alternate universe -type of Jane Austen, I found the book fun and interesting.  Bath and the time period colorfully portrayed. While the profusion of footnotes were interesting I would rather  they had been collected in the back of the book or incorporated into the  text -- the footnotes seemed to imply a scholarlyness that was out of step  with the murder mystery.  <br /> <br /> It's a quick read with a few novel twists and  turns -- enough to keep it interesting.

He's smart, intelligent, and politically saavy.  By birth, he should be assured a place in the ruling class when he reaches maturity. <br /> So, what's the problem? <br /> Miles was injured when his parents were victims of a terrorist attack while his mother was pregnant with him.  His brittle bones break at the slightest pressure and cannot be replaced with  synthetics until he reaches the end of his growth.  The people of Barrayar have a fear of genetic defects and many people condone killing all children who are not 'perfect'.  A practice that Mile's father has been trying to discourage in his province.   <br /> In &quot;Mountains of Mourning&quot;, Miles is authorized to find the person who killed a newborn child who was born with a treatable genetic disorder.  Imagine the locals 'joy' to find a 'mutie' has been sent to try one of them for doing their best to preserve their genetic purity. <br /> Miles uses his intelligence to overcome the obstacles in his path.  While everyone thinks he has been given every honor due to his position, Miles knows that he's earned every pat on the head, every medal, every good grade, every advancment that he has ever received.   <br /> Miles is not perfect.  He struggles and rails against the system, his body, and the attitudes of those around him.  His continuing struggle to achieve his own goals and to make something of himself -- make him a character that I, as a reader, can sympathize with.   <br /> I think what makes this series so addicting is that readers feel deeply about the main character.  We become emotionally involved in his life -- we cheer him on.  We want him to succeed against the odds because the author doesn't cheat -- Miles takes his beatings and goes on.  An example that many of us find reassuring.	1998-06-05

Then a member of his staff accuses him of sexual harassment and is found dead. <br /> NOT! <br /> Perhaps the first twists and turns of the plot are due to the incorrect book blurbs. Latham is nominated for Secretary of State.  He asks MacKenzie Smith (1/2 of the Truman's husband/wife and sometimes detective team) to help him with the confirmation process.   <br /> Latham has an impecable reputation. When he is found dead in the pocket park outside of the Rayburn building, an apparent suicide, a newpaper reports that a member of his staff has accused him of sexual harrasment. <br /> Now things get interesting.  Smith knows his friend would not commit suicide.  And Marge Brazier is missing -- the sexual harrassment charge unconfirmed.  <br /> Now the bodies start piling up.  Russian trade agreements, an American businessman who wants to make a killing in Russia's new democratic economy, the Russian Mafia, Russians who long for the good old days, and politics as usual -- all feed into the mix.

But then neither does she.  On a whim she drifts away, stumbles into a new life and finds she's not helpless.  She can hold down a job of her own.  Then her old life intrudes.  But Delia drifts only marginally reacting when others act.  We see the world through her eyes but she never makes a decision.  She never says 'I have decided to whatever'.  The ending is an insult to everyone.  Once again I finished a Tyler book to throw it against the wall.  If only her characters would DO something for themselves rather than just drift along not acting.	1998-01-08
