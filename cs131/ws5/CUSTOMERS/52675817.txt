Here, in one of Gardner's finest novels, domestic warfare between two spirited, overly-opinionated senior citizens--brother and sister--brings chaos to their community of friends and family.  Gardner's story says much about that vital tension at the heart of American life--the conflict between tradition and progressivism--and about the difficult business of pushing beyond this conflict to find a place where one can stand, secure and untroubled, beneath the haunted, holy light that comes with an autumn in the Land of the Free.	2005-09-30

Open up the book and you find that for every picture on a right-hand page there is a brief narrative caption on the left-hand page. I can best describe the artwork as being a lot like Edward Gorey (actually, the whole aesthetic of the book is Gorey-esque), a bit like Gustav Klimt (imagine Gorey getting it into his head to do Klimt figures), and not a small bit like the art of Dominic Kulcsar on his website The Wmmvrrvrrmm Place--really, up till now Dominic is the only person I know of who made good use of floating fetuses.<br /><br />And the book isn't as creepy as it sounds. The \\"incest\\" business comes in this way. . .  The story concerns three lonely sisters. The youngest sister falls in love with a strange man, and the oldest sister becomes wickedly jealous, thinking that she too loves the young man. When the youngest sister becomes pregnant, the middle sister begins a mystical relationship with the fetus, becoming her unborn nephew's spiritual mentor. That's about as weird as it gets--but I suppose that's weird enough!	2005-09-24

He talks to them each about certain aspects of the nature of time and then gives each a \\"time gift,\\" a visit to another time which will have special significance for him or her.  In the book's fourth and final section, the mystery of the stranger and his visits is solved in the most unexpected way while questions of time-theory give way to a unique aesthetic statement.<br /><br />Not too much can be said about the organizing concept or the ending of this book without ruining its effect on the reader.  Like most postmodern writers, Zivkovic depends heavily on the surprise created by the way he unexpectedly warps the traditional structure of a narrative.  Postmodern writers generally violate at least one of the big, assumed \\"laws\\" of storytelling (good pop culture examples of this are the films of Charlie Kaufman--\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" etc.).  This is not to say that Zivkovic's work is a hollow stylistic exercise, however.  The final section of \\"Time Gifts\\" offers the reader one or two truly substantive problems to ponder over.  Zivkovic's prose, also, is often a treat.  As an example, here is a priceless image from the novel, which comes as Zivkovic describes the modest amenities in the office belonging to an aging academic, a woman addicted to tea: \\"Several used tea bags were lying on the newspaper like tropical fish that had died of asphyxiation.\\"  A precious little gem, that.	2005-05-04

Since that time his ghostly novel, \\"The Moon Lamp\\" (1976), appears to have been as thoroughly forgotten as the author himself, but it is a book well worth rediscovering.<br /><br />Set in small town New England, the novel opens in a gregarious, communal voice as the native residents of Nottingham, New Hampshire give their collective view of the Linquists, a Chicago couple past middle age who have moved to the town apparently in hopes of settling there for their retirement. Winnie is a former travel agent and real estate agent, and Greg a former high school drama teacher; their daughter, Penelope, has gone off to college but comes home to visit often. Greg has inherited \\"the old Hoitt place,\\" and he and Winnie spend a couple of years laboriously restoring an authentic colonial look to the farmhouse. The Linquists' favorite activity during their many dinner parties is to regale visitors with the seemingly innumerable anecdotes related to the ghosts who haunt their home. These stories, always told with theatrical flair, are Greg's specialty.<br /><br />After the opening chapters, the communal voice fades and the novel becomes the intimate story of the Lindquist family and of Winnie in particular: \\". . .it was she, we always said, who had the power to have a vision that would be more than just a made-up story.\\" And very soon Winnie does see a ghost. Smith handles this scene with a masterly touch, giving us a most original and unsettling ghostly manifestation. Just at the point when the narrative brings us unexpectedly close to Winnie's perspective, we also find ourselves sharing her intense unease. It is a mark of Smith's craftsmanship that while many ghostly novels are able only to achieve one or two such deeply-affecting scenes, he gives us five or six--gives us one about every other chapter, in fact.<br /><br />As the novel progresses, it becomes clear that Smith's central theme is a question about what capacity we moderns--connected only in superficial ways to Place, and tending to over-intellectualize everything--have for being haunted. In some backward way hasn't the ghost, as symbol of history and the past, become just another novelty to us? Smith's answer is no; in our fractured world and inside our fractured selves, there are simply that many more dark, uncharted holes where our histories, the specters of our neglect, may retreat to breed and plot against us.sses, it becomes clear that Smith's central theme is a question about what capacity we moderns--connected only in superficial ways to Place, and tending to over-intellectualize everything--have for being haunted.

Anyone revealing sensitive plot material about this book is doing a great disservice to the reader and to the author's carefully constructive narrative; so let me say from the start that this review is \\"spoiler\\" free.<br /><br />Kazuo Ishiguro has written what possibly will be remembered as the most readable, most important novel of 2005.  Like P.D. James' \\"The Children of Men\\" or Anthony Burgess' \\"The Wanting Seed,\\" \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a challenging work of speculative fiction that exposes the social absurdities and junk ethics of the hyper-industrial age.  It is also a profound work that questions what it is, in memory and in sentiment, that makes us human.  The novel's deceptively simple language and eminently accessible narrative voice neatly hide the workings of what is in fact a most complex, innovative novel.  Take for instance Ishiguro's twist on the \\"speculative fiction\\" format.  Instead of placing the story in the near future, he has placed it in the near past--thus refusing the reader the small comfort of distancing himself from the story's implications by means of the \\"near future\\" buffer.  Ishiguro seems to be warning that the seeds of wrong, in this eerie cautionary tale, are present already in our history and our society as they are; only a few minor hurdles of technology and modern, degenerative philosophy remain to be surmounted.<br /><br />For anyone who has finished this book and would like to see its themes developed further in a couple of non-fiction books, I can recommend C.S. Lewis' \\"The Abolition of Man\\" and Wendell Berry's \\"Life Is a Miracle : An Essay Against Modern Superstition.\\"	2005-04-18

One day an Edinburgh missionary arrives on the island where Stevenson lives.  He appears at chance moments to Stevenson and speaks in a manner both cryptic and threatening.  Soon a series of terrible crimes occurs on the island, and the natives are certain that Stevenson is responsible.<br /><br />As a story based on the \\"double\\" or \\"doppelganger\\" theme, Manguel's book can be located in the literary neighborhood of Poe's \\"William Wilson,\\" Chekhov's \\"The Black Monk,\\" and Dostoyevsky's \\"The Double.\\"  However, the story never does anything very unique to create an atmosphere of unease, nor does it travel deep enough into its characters or themes to rank with the best stories of this sort, such as Conrad's \\"The Secret Sharer\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" or Gustav Meyrink's \\"The Golem\\" and \\"The Green Face\\"--let alone that masterwork of Stevenson's which Manguel obviously hopes to evoke, \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  Perhaps it is the fact that this long story, or short-ish novella, is bound between hardcovers that one expects something of greater weight and significance.	2005-04-09

In this short polemic work of 133 pages, Dale Allison makes a strong argument that the secularization of the modern West is not due to philosophical proofs against religion or a large-scale, reasoned enlightenment among the populace.  Rather, this secularization is due largely to a basic change in environment, resulting from the Industrial Revolution.  The environmental factors that once engendered a religious sensitivity--long periods of silence and darkness (that is, periods of sensory relaxation) and direct, regular contact with nature--have been replaced in the modern world with constant sensory stimulation and insular, artificial environments.<br /><br />Allison promotes all of the following as an antidote to this modern trouble: cultivation of silence and darkness, contact with nature, a return to traditional physical postures in prayer, meditation on the deeds of saints and heroes, and development of the \\"ascetic imagination.\\"  His antidote culminates in the last of these prescriptions, and Allison gives this brief three-part program for \\"fortifying\\" the ascetic imagination: \\"(1) extended reflection upon transcendent realities, (2) prolonged experience of the natural world, and (3) stillness without and within.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Silence of Angels\\" makes many wonderful points with many quotations from Christian and non-Christian sources alike.  However, my one reservation is that the book, as brief as it is, might have been strengthened by some editing in the chapters at its center.  Allison occasionally belabors his points, assembles more examples than necessary, and lets his argument dwell on small points for too long--thus breaking its momentum.  All in all, though, this is a fine book worthy to be placed in the company of C.S. Lewis' \\"The Abolition of Man,\\" Wendell Berry's \\"Life Is a Miracle,\\" and Michael Aeschliman's \\"The Restitution of Man.\\"	2005-01-16

The estate's wood is to be cut down soon to provide wood for the war effort, and two men have been sent into the wood by the forestry service to collect cones for seed. The men are brothers, and the younger is a simple-minded but very empathetic hunchback with \\"a face like Lord Byron\\". Through no fault of their own, the brothers acquire the irrational hatred of the estate's gamekeeper. The wood, itself lying under the shadow of ruin, quickly becomes a dangerous and mysterious setting in which the problem of evil plays out to tragedy.<br />Jenkin's short novel is the stuff of high literature and evokes associations with Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and the bold themes of Joseph Conrad. Also, the novel exhibits a strong and welcome moral sense not often seen modern fiction today. It addresses the intense issues of character and virtue also seen, for instance, in the works of the mid-century Oxford group \\"the Inklings\\", especially the novels Charles Williams (such as \\"The Descent into Hell\\" and \\"All Hallows\\"), though without the supernatural element. As a story of genuine, concentrated pathos, \\"The Cone-Gatherers\\" is the sort of haunting novel that brings the reader to a stark confrontation with the truth of human nature.	2004-12-02

The novel is very leisurely paced (think of Wendell Berry at his most leisurely) and meanders down the side roads of memory and reverie--telling a few tall tales, recounting the strange exploits of the narrator's firebrand abolitionist grandfather, and dwelling on the occasional theological issue (the narrator has wrestled much of his life with the humanist theology of Ludwig Feuerbach, a struggle made easier for the narrator by the works of Karl Barth). Being a slow-building, character-based novel, there is no plot to speak of in \\"Gilead.\\" However, the story ultimately addresses the theme of the prodigal son and ends with a touching and nearly-unexpected poignancy.

Russell Kirk (along with the recently deceased Jack Cady) ranks as one of the few top-notch, modern American ghost story writers, and for far too long Kirk's stories have been out of print.  This book collects all but a very few of Kirk's lesser tales (which are available for die-hards and completists in the pricey but gorgeous recent Kirk collection produced by Ash-Tree Press in two volumes).<br />The stories in this collection include many of the best ghostly tales ever written, including \\"Lex Talionis,\\" \\"Fate's Purse,\\" \\"Watchers at the Straight Gate,\\" &amp; \\"The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost.\\"  Not to mention Kirk's masterpiece, \\"There's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding\\"--if you can read this one alone in your home after dark and, once you finish it, not be driven to turn on every light in the house (and maybe your stereo as well), then you're a braver soul than I.  Kirk indulges several of the genre's conventions and breathes new life into them while giving us a whole host of wonderful characters as unforgettable as the denizens of a Dickens novel.  The collection does include two or three stories that drop below the high standard of Kirk's usual tales, but this in no way diminishes the his accomplishments as a virtuoso writer crafting prose that is as cultivated and engaging in its own way as that of Flannery O'Connor or F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />The dust jacket blurbs--of the rare, substantive variety--lend much legitimacy to Kirk's status as a significant literary figure, culled as these blurbs are from such diverse sources as Ray Bradbury, Madeline L'Engle, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Howard, and Robert Aickman.  I fully agree with Bradbury's blurb: \\"For too many years Russell Kirk, almost like the title of this book, remained half seen in the American literary scene.

It's a complicated equation: it has been 21 years since fans of Stephen R. Donaldson have been able to visit the Land with a new Thomas Covenant novel, 10 \\"real-world\\" years since an outsider has walked in the Land, and about 3,500 native years since the Land itself has seen an outsider.  Now Linden Avery returns accompanied by 3 (or possibly 4?) others, including Thomas Covenant's mad wife.  Once in the Land Linden must search for her son, who is threatened by Lord Foul--and Foul now has influence over one of two white gold rings that have come to the Land.  Linden holds the other; it being the ring she took from Covenant when he died 10 years earlier.  Sure, Covenant is dead, but that shouldn't worry fans--Donaldson has titled this \\"The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\" for good reason.  Through the course of the book we are reminded that the Law of Death was broken in the first chronicles, and the Law of Life broken in the second.  Now it is the Arch of Time and the foundations of the Law itself that are in very real danger.  To complicate matters, the Land is afflicted with a malevolent pall to rival the Sunbane and massive reality-storms known as \\"Caesures.\\"<br />For Linden's return to the Land, Donaldson has marshaled many of the unique elements of the past six novels, reviving certain wonders that seemed to have disappeared forever from the Land.  He also raises questions left open by the other books, questions fans may never have even considered.  What ever became of the Ramen and the Ranyhyn, the ur-viles and Waynhim?  What came of the Haruchai Cail's lust for the merewives?  What use was made of the Staff of Law after Linden began the healing of the Sunbane, then left the Land?  And perhaps most troubling is the transformation we see that has come to the Haruchai.  Once known as the faithful Bloodguard and servants of the Lords of Revelstone, the Haruchai now occupy Revelstone themselves as \\"the Masters of the Land.\\"<br />Donaldson has written a captivating novel to launch this 4-part series.  The 90-page prologue delivers heavy echoes of the prologue piece to \\"The Wounded Land\\" and very effectively kicks off the story with a suspenseful edge.  Once Linden has been transported from the real world to the Land, things slow down a bit.  The rest of the book consists of two parts, labeled: \\"Part I: Chosen for this Desecration\\" &amp; \\"Part II: The Only Form of Innocence.\\"  Personally, I feel that the first few chapters of Part I are somewhat loose and could have used some tightening to focus the events and drama of those chapters.  However, the story soon recovers its pace.  By Part II, Linden defines a quest for herself and her companions, and the unprecedented audacity of that quest is truly breathtaking.

Any 5-page section of this book is enough to blow Moore?s cover as the modern world?s most diabolically clever propagandist.  Take, say, pages 21-25 in which the authors detail Harlan Jacobson?s (then editor of ?Film Comment? magazine) 1989 expose of Moore?s film ?Roger & Me,? in which he reveals that nearly every event that Moore portrayed as ?fallout? from the 1986 GM layoffs in Flint, MI (remember all those inept attempts by the city to revitalize its economy?) were--gasp! surprise!--actually events that took place before 1986 and had nothing to do with the layoffs; all these events that Moore shows after the layoffs actually occurred in 1980-1985.  (Pauline Kael also wrote a damning review of the film for the ?New Yorker,? and her piece was considered the reason ?Roger & Me? did no business at the Oscars that year.)  Or take just the 3-page section, pages 178-180, in which the authors duplicate exactly Moore?s own conspiracy-theory methods to show the connection between Moore himself (via Miramax, Disney, & the Carlyle Group) to the bin Laden family!

As he proved in his brilliant first novel, \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" (and the screenplay for the wonderful film adaptation), and his highly-acclaimed 2003 independent film, \\"Pieces of April,\\" Peter Hedges has mastered the delicate art of conjuring charming but utterly realistic characters and portraying, with great tenderness, the complicated dynamics of troubled families.  From the discovery that one's family is not an invulnerable bastion of loving safety to the sudden, almost-mystical epiphanies of the erotic undercurrent running through all of life, Hedges has here captured, with breathtaking authenticity, the unique sensation of growing up.  At the same time, the story is firmly and convincingly embedded in a specific time and place, suburban Iowa in the late 1960s.  Hedges includes a rich but never distracting veneer of historical and pop culture references.  He also peppers the narrative with certain toy and product names familiar to the era, something that does a great deal to convey both the growing commercialization of American society at the time and the innocence that once seemed an inherent part of the modern world's marketing machine--aimed primarily at the young, as so much advertising and entertainment is.  In the end, one finds that \\"An Ocean in Iowa\\" is the antithesis of the plot-driven novel.  Rather, it is something that is often more difficult to achieve without resulting to cheap melodrama or sentimentality: an engaging, evocative character study--or, as such stories always become for Hedges, a family study.  Hedges has one simple goal: seeing young Scotty Ocean through his seventh year, and past all threatens him and his family, without permanent damage befalling the dreamer inside him.  It is a testimony to his mastery of the novelist's craft that we worry, all the way to the end, whether Hedges can actually pull this off.t that we worry, all the way to the end, whether Hedges can actually pull this off.	2004-04-18

For western Christians, Mathewes-Green offers a startlingly fresh perspective on issues such as the transformative act of conversion, authority within the church, the meaning of repentance and forgiveness, and the purpose of prayer.  The chapter on \\"The Jesus Prayer\\" is reason enough for reading the book.  The later chapters, \\"Dealing with Others : The Smaller Circle\\" and \\"Dealing with Others : The Larger Circle\\" make for important and humbling reading and could be taken together, for great benefit, with C.S.

In \\"A Conflict of Visions,\\" Thomas Sowell compiles a study of the two dominant socio-political ideologies of the day via the idea of \\"visions\\"--that is, a received, almost precognitive set of assumptions about human nature and humanity's place in the world.  Sowell calls these the \\"constrained\\" (i.e. \\"conservative\\") and \\"unconstrained\\" (i.e. \\"liberal\\") visions.  The two visions are fundamentally different and, therefore, produce conflicting ideas about such basic concepts as knowledge and reason and conflicting attitudes toward such values as equality, power, and justice.  Sowell substantiates his observations of the conflict by quoting often from those authors over the past 250 years who wrote most insightfully and prolifically from the vantage of one or the other of these visions--such writers as Edmund Burke, William Godwin, John Locke, Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet, Ronald Dworkin and Milton Friedman.<br /><br />In the conservative vision, human nature is viewed as essentially selfish, and society protects individuals from each other through the various institutions, traditions, religions, and laws that have evolved over the course of history.  However, the liberal vision considers human nature as essentially good and hampered only by various power structures and social restrictions (thus progress is made by subverting those institutions and traditions that conservatives prize).  As one example of the effect this conflict of visions has on society, Sowell shows that the conservative vision has this view of knowledge: knowledge is as vast as the number of human beings in the world, and thus some form of democracy is the best method of ensuring that that knowledge is well represented in society.  The conservative vision sees knowledge as one facet of the human experience, but it does not elevate reason to the highest value in that experience.  The liberal vision sees knowledge as the key to solving the world's problems (whereas conservatives believe there are no solutions--rather, there are only \\"better\\" and \\"worse\\" options).

This, his last book, is a wonderful tribute to that cult genre he loved so much, the ghost story.<br />Written in Cady's irresistible, gregarious, ear-bending storyteller's style, each piece is something unique and surprising.  &quot;The Lady With the Blind Dog,&quot; though full of distinctive Cady elements, reads like the sort of modern mytho-fantasy so prominent in the writing of Neil Gaiman.  &quot;Daddy Dearest&quot; is one of the more successful renditions of the &quot;humorous ghost story&quot; that I've come across, succeeding as it does by substituting fright with Twain-like, tall-tale audacity.  The collection's 80-page novella, &quot;The Time that Time Forgot&quot;--though marred somewhat by anti-war moralizing--is a thick, atmospheric, mystical adventure.  And &quot;The Ghost of Dive Bomber Hill,&quot; I am certain, will prove to be one of the great, enduring American ghost stories, a tale ranking near the work of that master ghostly author Russell Kirk.<br />In addition, the book includes two wonderfully engaging essays, one on the ghost story and the other on religion in science fiction.	2004-03-04
US	52675817	RX9V6PLJBCIXU	1565122186	186940438	John Gardner: Literary Outlaw	Books	4	25	26	N	N	Heartbreaking	As the story of a now unjustly neglected American author of great scholarly and artistic importance, this biography begins with an inspirational tone that, all too soon, turns heartbreaking and as affecting as anything in Gardner's own fiction.  In many ways the life of John Gardner mirrors a struggle in the heart of modern America--there is something especially tragic about great idealism and intellectual conviction that fails to manifest fully in one's personal life.<br />Silesky's book has a few failings, but the greatest of these is something that, most likely, could not be avoided with the present effort--and that is the book's length.  For the most part, it seems that when he came to tough choices on what to include, Silesky stuck with his expressed theme, that of Gardner as \\"literary outlaw,\\" a conflicted author who struggled against authority while also championing the ideas of \\"law and order.\\"  It cannot have been an easy thing to get the go-ahead for publishing even a book of moderate length about an author of whose novels all but one have dropped out of print in the 20 years since his death.  However, squeezing the experiences of Gardner's 49 years into just over 300 pages makes for a very tight fit, especially when it comes to the details of certain relationships.  For instance, we get a few references to the \\"several miscarriages\\" Joan, his first wife, had.  But, with the exception of the final miscarriage, we do not get a real sense of the impact this had on the relationship.  We also must wonder about Gardner's relationship with his two children when the family split, since we never learn if he had much contact with Lucy and Joel in the last years of his life.  One especially craves more details of his association with other writers--his now-famous students, such as Charles Johnson and Raymond Carver, and the peers he knew socially, such Joyce Carol Oates and William Gass.  Such details might have been elaborated if Silesky had curbed the attention paid, at key points in the biography, to Gardner's books and their critical reception, yet the context of these passages is important as well.  Silesky has walked a difficult line structuring this book, and we can be grateful for his effort while also hoping that the book helps to fuel further Gardner scholarship and, perhaps, another biography or two sometime down the line.  For the present, this book satisfies a long-felt void in the realm of Gardner scholarship.<br />I know that all of Gardner's family is not happy with this book, but Gardner enthusiasts will find it irresistible.  A word of warning, however.  In the modern world we have perhaps an unprecedented number of opportunities to develop admiration for people we have never met, and Gardner has earned his fair share of devotees--in no small part due to that invaluable instruction book for writers, \\"The Art of Fiction.\\"  So, be warned that learning the details of Gardner's personal life may not be an entirely pleasant business.  However illuminating this book is about the human condition, the life it chronicles also has a side to it that is terribly devastating.id, at key points in the biography, to Gardner's books and their critical reception, yet the context of these passages is important as well.

Callaghan believed in capturing the bare truth and honest emotional content of people's lives, so his prose shuns stylistic busyness. Edmund Wilson called him &quot;the most unjustly neglected novelist in the English-speaking world,&quot; and Maxwell Perkins called him the world's best short story writer.<br />THAT SUMMER IN PARIS, as a memoir of Paris in the 20s, is every bit as engaging a book, if more limited in scope, as Hemingway's A MOVEABLE FEAST. The book begins with Callaghan's inspiring story of meeting Hemingway while working on the same paper in Toronto--at the time Callaghan was in his early 20s (still in college), and Hemingway was a couple years older. Hemingway had temporarily left Paris and was in town working for the paper to provide his wife Hadley with the benefits of Toronto hospitals during childbirth. Hemingway quickly became a sort of literary patron for Callaghan and, when he returned to Europe, took Callaghan's short stories with him and passed them around Paris. Fitzgerald became enthusiastic about Callaghan's work and also began championing him with Paris and New York publishers. After Callaghan published 2 books of fiction (in no small part due to the help of his &quot;Paris friends&quot;), Callaghan finally made his own visit, with his wife, to Paris in 1929. The anecdotes he recounts are simply marvelous, and I can't recommend the book highly enough. Boxing matches with Hemingway, Fitzgerald's drunken histrionics, a strange evening with Joyce and a phonograph... it's priceless stuff.	2003-12-20

The production is fairly basic, with a front cover featuring a detail from the cover illustration of Aickman's THE RIVER RUNS UPHILL.  The book is staple-bound, which unfortunately means that there is no readable spine--hence, the book is not destined for the bookcase.<br />The book's first chapter, \\"The Life,\\" runs 20 pages and pulls together a biographical sketch of Aickman, synthesizing threads from such sources as Aickman's THE ATTEMPTED RESCUE and THE RIVER RUNS UPHILL and David Bolton's THE RACE AGAINST TIME : HOW BRITAIN'S WATERWAYS WERE SAVED.  For those who have not read these books, this chapter will be especially interesting.<br />The remaining chapters seem to touch briefly on all of Aickman's published fiction--the two novels and 48 short stories.  Crawford is particularly interested in Aickman's aesthetic proximity to surrealism and in Aickman's distinctive gender themes.<br />Among the portions of the book I found particularly interesting are the helpful bibliography and the personal letters Crawford received from Aickman's acquaintances in the early to mid 1980s, in the years following Aickman's death.  Crawford quotes extensively from other sources throughout the book, but twice he shares large portions from these letters.  In one instance nearly two pages of the book are given over to a letter from Barbara Balch, Aickman's long-time personal secretary.  In another case close to three pages are taken up with an essay-letter from Aickman's friend Valerie Butler.  Crawford also draws occasionally from sources as recent as the 2002 memoir by Elizabeth Jane Howard, SLIPSTREAM (where Aickman pops up as a former lover of E.J.H.).	2003-05-12

English anthropologist Alfred Munday has returned to his homeland for health reasons after a decade in Uganda studying the Bwamba tribe.  Frustrated by this forced change in his life, Munday finds himself unable to begin preparing his research for publication.  His marriage sits on precarious ground, and he and his wife have just taken on a domestic disaster: the home they leased site-unseen--Bowood House, \\"the Black House\\" to locals--is ruinous, inhospitable, and apparently haunted.  Munday's superior, intellectual airs quickly alienate the couple from their neighbors in the town of Four Ashes.  Then the beautiful Caroline appears, and she initiates a torrid, reckless affair with Munday, whose old troubles are quickly exchanged for new ones.<br />There is a prevailing tone of despair, even damnation, to Paul Theroux's ghost story, THE BLACK HOUSE.  Munday is a pathetic creature, a surly egoist unable to make or keep friends or to fill his roles as husband and scholar.  He allows the trappings of his identity slowly to be stripped away until he is only a shadow of his formerly serious and professional self.  He invites an African acquaintance to Four Ashes for a visit, but Munday, under the influence of this growing malaise, becomes suddenly embarrassed by the very sight of the man and abuses him at every turn.  Though clearly he needs no help at it, some of his new neighbors are more than willing to aid Munday's decline: while giving a presentation at a local church about his anthropological work in Africa, a valuable and dangerous Bwamba artifact is stolen from him; the theft drives Munday to distraction, sensing that if he should ever see the object again it will not be under happy circumstances.  The great irony which unfolds over the course of the novel is that this anthropologist, who considers it his vocation to make one African tribe comprehensible to the outside world, cannot himself adapt to the simple community of Four Ashes.  In placing himself above small town life, Munday rejects the basic principals of social integration, thus making himself ideal prey for the mysterious Caroline.<br />The quality of Theroux's writing and the dark mix of psychology, intense sensuality, and metaphysical unease place THE BLACK HOUSE in the estimable company of Richard Adams' THE GIRL IN A SWING and Robert Aickman's \\"strange stories.\\"  This is a territory in which unexpected and inexplicable episodes drive the narrative: Munday glimpses two mutilated dogs under a tarp in a local man's garden; a woman applying for a maid's position at Bowood House leaves information leading the Mundays to the wrong address; the scorching eroticism of Caroline's surprise visits threaten to leave the Mundays' home in flames.  Such incidents accumulate over the course of the novel, tempered by Theroux's cool but entrancing prose.  From this grows a palpable tension that--perhaps in keeping with its nature--never actually resolves.  One almost anticipates the novel's vague, indecipherable ending, a point at which Theroux compels his readers to share, for a moment, Munday's banishment to a maddening limbo.ll town life, Munday rejects the basic principals of social integration, thus making himself ideal prey for the mysterious Caroline.<br />The quality of Theroux's writing and the dark mix of psychology, intense sensuality, and metaphysical unease place THE BLACK HOUSE in the estimable company of Richard Adams' THE GIRL IN A SWING and Robert Aickman's \\"strange stories.\\"  This is a territory in which unexpected and inexplicable episodes drive the narrative: Munday glimpses two mutilated dogs under a tarp in a local man's garden; a woman applying for a maid's position at Bowood House leaves information leading the Mundays to the wrong address; the scorching eroticism of Caroline's surprise visits threaten to leave the Mundays' home in flames.

Imagine you are an old man so afraid of life that you have spent most of your years alone, living in a small room and working in an insignificant job as a security guard on the front steps of a bank, your only pleasure somehow derived from the monotony of your daily routine.  Then one day a living creature, a pigeon, appears unexpectedly on your doorstep, and it shouldn't be there--it is out of place.  And this frightens you like nothing has in many years.  You flee your apartment (for good, you think). Because of your agitated state you break your own routines; you begin acting strangely, and your perceptions alter.  This sets off a chain reaction of encounters in which you, despite your lifelong precautions to the contrary, begin interacting with a world that seems determined to drive you over the edge.<br />Suskind's \\"The Pigeon\\" is subtly meticulous in depicting its protagonist's complex psychological journey.  The story is at once free of sentimentality, raw, honest, and yet life-affirming in the most vital sense.  While it is reminiscent of Kafka and--most notably--of Knut Hamson's \\"Hunger,\\" Suskind's novella also manages to glimpse something just around the corner, something almost out of sight, beyond the valley of despair.	2002-06-07
US	52675817	R2OBWDTRQ70A62	0743235150	796500127	Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales	Books	2	4	9	N	N	Beware the empty calories, dear reader!	Of all the narrative theories out there, I'm most taken with the model of fiction as \\"a vivid and continuous dream in the reader's mind\\" held by John Gardner. If you spend some time looking into studies of dreaming (or just dip into them casually, as I have) you'll probably come across the idea of \\"significance,\\" that element of dreaming which shines with poignancy and screams at the dreamer: \\"This is it! Pay attention. This is the important thing; never forget!\\" The dreamer may spend an entire dream chasing frisbees with his pet collie or trekking deep into an attic to find that perfect spot beneath the roof of his childhood home where he spends an evening reattaching the limbs of his sister's toy dolls. Somehow the ridiculous and mundane acquire, in dreaming, absolute significance. As I see it, it's much the same in successful fiction.<br /><br /> Stephen King achieves something of this in \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton,\\" one story in his new collection EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL. The story follows John Dillinger and two of his gang of outlaws, Homer and Jack, as they hide from the law while trying to nurse Jack through a messy bullet wound. In the end Jack's life cannot be saved. Homer performs his famous \\"fly roping\\" trick to amuse the dying man, and at the same time we learn just how John Dillinger's luck finally ran out, leaving him vulnerable to \\"the Feds\\" the next time they would cross paths.<br /><br /> While pleasantly surprised with \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton,\\" I was unable to find an encouraging degree of significance in any of the other five stories I read before giving up on EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.<br /><br /> \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" transports the old buried-alive storyline to an autopsy room where a man finds himself conscious but paralyzed by a snake bite as a coroner prepares him for dissection. King seems content here to contrive a simple \\"will he survive/won't he survive?\\" scenario, jerking his audience along a jarring and unenjoyable roller coaster ride during which we are expected to bite our nails and quiver in anticipation. Worse, King slaps pop culture references around his narrative shamelessly. The autopsied man looks like Michael Bolton; cue the dull Michael Bolton puns. One of the autopsy room orderlies looks like he belongs on BAYWATCH, another on MELROSE PLACE. We also manage to fit in references to ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, GENERAL HOSPITAL, and JEOPARDY. From all appearances King finds it too much trouble to create a character or a mood from scratch. He'd rather apply prefabricated exteriors--elements easily and cheaply acquired by himself and effortlessly (read: \\"without exercise of the imagination\\") accessed by his audience. Pop culture inbreeding, ugh. Is there anything worse?<br /><br /> Sure, someone might argue that these references are actually appropriate, even necessary, for the mode of this story. But does it make for interesting prose? No, it does not. And anyway, why does King do this same thing in so many stories?<br /><br /> \\"Lucky Quarters\\" is little more than a sketchy, ambiguous little story garnished with some NATURAL BORN KILLERS references and a bad Tex Avery pun. Oh, also King tries to make us believe that he's a real writer by tackling the melodramatic anguish of a single mom cleaning rooms at a casino hotel. Ho hum.<br /><br /> \\"In the Death Room\\" is one of those revenge stories about torture in a third world country. A tortured man turns the torture device on his tormentors. Yada, yada. References: BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, E.R., Roadrunner cartoons, the Hanson boys.<br /><br /> If there's one story more unpleasant than \\"Death Room,\\" it has to be \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\"--another attempt by King to be veddy veddy literary. This is the story of Alfie, a travelling salesman who checks into a motel to kill himself. Alfie has found his only joy in life for the past few years in the strange act of recording the restroom graffiti he sees onhis travels. The story ends with Alfie making an absurd challenge to mother nature, a challenge we never see the result of... and so maybe he kills himself, maybe he doesn't--we'll never know. The most deeply unpleasant moment of the story comes when Alfie worries what would happen if someone found his corpse beside his pathetic notebook of bathroom poetry:<br /><br />\\"Yet the notebook might be a real embarrassment once he was dead.  It would be like accidentally hanging yourself in the closet because you were experimenting with a new way of j**king off and got found that way with your shorts under your feet and s**t on your ankles.\\"<br /><br />Why, Stephen, why? What is this supposed to make us feel? And where has the significance gone?<br /><br /> But, oh yes, there was one other story I read before I gave up on the book. \\"The Man in the Black Suit.\\" Something about a country boy going out fishing and meeting the devil by the river. The devil chases him around for a while then lets the boy alone. Something like that; I forget.<br /><br />BTW, After abandoning EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, I picked up \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" and am finding it very enjoyable. I'm just afraid that King is one of these poor writers who can't sift his material and distinguish when he's writing well from when he's writing poorly, and it's such an exhausting job--as a reader--to do that job for him.y ends with Alfie making an absurd challenge to mother nature, a challenge we never see the result of... and so maybe he kills himself, maybe he doesn't--we'll never know.

Henry Darger (1892-1973) spent most of his life working as a dishwasher, janitor, and bandage roller at a hospital in Chicago.  Darger's mother died in childbirth with his sister when Darger was 3 years old, and his father died when Darger was 15.  The family was economically destitute, and the young Darger ended up in boys homes, orphanages, and such unsavory institutions as the \\"Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children\\" in Lincoln, Illinois.  Darger lived most of his adult life in the same apartment, and when he died in 1973 his landlord found a number of homemade books containing three large manuscripts written and illustrated by Darger, each more than 5000 pages long.<br />  The most important manuscript is the first, a 14 volume work titled \\"The Realms of the Unreal, or the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion,\\" which Darger spent two decades writing and illustrating.  This epic is the chronicled history of a 4-year war on an imaginary world.  On this world, children have been enslaved and a war breaks out to free them.  Spearheading the rebellion are the seven Vivian sisters, little girl heroes--figures which seem to have been based, at least partly, on Joan of Arc.  Among the story's other main influences are Frank L. Baum's Oz books, the works of Charles Dickens, and the history of the American Civil War.<br />  Darger's artwork is both imaginatively vivid and disturbing.  Most of the art involves little girls as the heroes and the victims, with men and supernatural creatures called \\"the Blegiglomenean Serpents\\" (or, \\"the Blengins\\") as their oppressors.  The little girls are often depicted in idyllic portraits; however, they are also often shown being strangled or killed in battle.  Also, they are often nude, and sometimes portrayed as hermaphrodites with male genitals.  Much of Darger's work is composed of individual figures traced from magazines or comics.  Artistically, Darger is compared with figures as diverse as Blake and Andy Warhol.Andy Warhol.	2002-02-26

Berry then proposes a more cautious, more humble worldview in which life is seen as a mystery and a miracle, as something we will never be able to fully control or even understand.

Donald Margulies' &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize in Drama, a well-deserved award.  The play deals with two couples who have been close for a long time, but now one couple is going through a divorce.  Throughout the play, relationships are questioned and reorganized.  The still-married couple find themselves assessing the strength of their own relationship and mourning the little corner of their world which dies when their friends divorce.<br /><br /> &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot; is a rare gem--a questing, moral play that takes an honest look at the issues of commitment and fidelity in today's world.  I don't think I've seen a new play which delved so deep and true into the heart of an everyday issue, and with everyday characters, since David Mamet's &quot;Oleanna.&quot;  The last two scenes bare the relationships and souls of the characters so fully (and, thankfully, without overt hysterics) that I literally got the chills.<br /><br /> In scene three of the second act Gabe meets his friend Tom a few months after Tom and his wife have split.  Tom is living with his travel agent girlfriend, and Gabe quickly tires of Tom's rationalizations and his descriptions of the fantasy life he has constructed around himself.  Tom talks fanatically about his newfound freedom, and Gabe tells him he's starting to sound &quot;like a Moonie.&quot;  Gabe finally voices the essential problem he has with Tom's decision to leave his family.  Gabe says, &quot;The key to civilization, I think, is fighting the impulse to chuck it all.&quot;  Then Tom tries to tell Gabe that maybe Gabe's own marriage isn't all that it appears to be; Tom has heard Gabe complain in the past, and Tom says that he knows the signs of trouble.  The difference between the two men, however, is that Gabe believes in working at his marriage and cannot imagine ever giving up.  &quot;You don't get it,&quot; Gabe says.  &quot;I _cling_ to Karen; I _cling_ to her.

Gustav Meyrink's first novel, \\"The Golem,\\" is without a doubt his masterwork.  Certainly it presents his central concerns and the mystical  pattern for his later writing, but even more, the literary elements of  &quot;The Golem&quot; carry a double measure of inspiration. Perhaps the  most obvious is the hypnagogia (the state of consciousness between waking  and sleeping) through which the narrator drifts in the first three  chapters. Such surreal episodes are not uncommon in fiction, but often even  the most earnest attempts fail. Meyrink, however, telegraphs the thrill of  this state as only a genuine mystic could. His narrative floats  tangentially from one idea to the next, travelling in a rough spiral,  lingering at times in the natural orbit of certain images and thoughts. It  is only upon finishing the novel that one realizes how these chapters  establish not only the mood of the story, but also its themes and  plot.<br /><br /> The golem itself--a creature whose legend is rooted in  Prague's Ghetto, the depressed Jewish quarter--has a special magic.  Though  the golem might easily have been portrayed with an uninspired knockoff of  Frankenstein's monster, Meyrink made it a spiritual creature (a prototype  for similar entities in his later work).  In fact, the golem seems to exist  solely in the realm of possibility, a thing of story, memory, and confused  dreams.<br /><br /> The novel's narrator, Pernath, is a fractured personality  whose inner turmoil manifests in his strong attraction to three different  women and in his literal amnesia--his memory extends only a few years back,  to the time since he came to live in the Ghetto.  The golem appears to him  in private as an enigmatic angel of mercy who hints at a possible healing,  while insinuating itself at the same time into Pernath's mind like a  spectral parasite.  Though their contact is always indirect, Pernath begins  to identify in an odd way with the golem.  In fact, the one time that a  public sighting of the golem stirs the Ghetto, it is actually Pernath who  has been mistaken for the creature.<br /><br /> A less striking but equally  significant element of the story is the character of Aaron Wassertrum, the  Jewish junkdealer whose shop lies on the street below Pernath's room.  Possibly Meyrink's most well-drawn villain, essentially an ethical  sinkhole, Wassertrum is the perfect foil for Pernath.  His furtive malice,  consisting largely of absurd lies and meticulous manipulation, is  strikingly reminiscent of Kafka, Meyrink's contemporary.<br /><br /> The  careful reader can also explore \\"The Golem\\" with the source material in  mind and find an additional layer to the story.  For example, the Jewish  legends sometimes describe the golem coming to life when a rabbi writes the  name of God on its forehead.  Meyrink relates another version in which a  magic charm is \\"placed behind it's teeth.\\"  However, in another twist of  confused identity, one character in the novel learns that he has switch  hats with someone during the day and finds Pernath's name in the hat's  lining, possibly just where it may have pressed against the forehead.  This  event is followed directly by the golem's first appearance.<br /><br /> \\"The  Golem\\" is certainly one of the great neglected novels of our time.  Meyrink's mysticism is always balanced with a portion of skepticism, giving  his worldview a tension which holds valuable insight about the time in  which he lived.  The novel also depicts the intense sort of claustrophobia  which grew out of the early industrial era, and the tone of this anxiety  draws natural associations with Poe, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky.  The fact  that Meyrink managed to integrate these qualities with a refined arc of  mystical thought demonstrates just important he is to the literary  tradition.<br /><br /> Finally, I highly recommend the Dover edition of \\"The  Golem,\\" translated by Madge Pemberton.  While Meyrink readers owe an  immense debt to Dedalus/Ariadne and translator Mike Mitchell for giving us,  over the past decade, Meyrink's four other novels previously unavailable in  English, Pemberton's 1928 translation of this novel is a finer read.  Mitchell may be an excellent translator, and I am sure his modernization of  the text has its own importance.  However, Pemberton has an eloquence  unmatched by the new translation.  Take, for instance, this line from  Pemberton, describing a dream image: \\"...she wore a cloak made all of flowing  tears.\\"  Mitchell's translation reads: \\"...she was wearing a cloak of flowing  teardrops.\\"  The Dover edition, with Pemberton's translation, also includes  supplementary material including 8 superb illustrations from the original  1915 edition and an excellent introduction by the editor, E. F. Bleiler,  which serves as a fine summary of Meyrink's life and work.or Mike Mitchell for giving us,  over the past decade, Meyrink's four other novels previously unavailable in  English, Pemberton's 1928 translation of this novel is a finer read.

As a modern virtuoso of atmospheric horror, Robert Aickmaninjects each of his \\"strange stories\\" with a lingering, surreal terror.  \\"Painted Devils\\" is all the more disturbing for the recurring themes that echo down the chilly corridors of this nine story collection.  The most pronounced of these themes are doomed romance, communal hauntings, and abominable, monstrous offspring.  A typical story begins with the protagonist venturing into the unknown, perhaps going to a new country or city, though sometimes the change is as simple as beginning a new job or visiting the theatre.  There an unexpected friendship or love affair forms, and suddenly great gaps appear in the protagonist's conception of reality.  In Aickman's world children are not always cute or even harmless, neither sex nor love brings contented bliss, and the dead don't always stay in the ground, nor are their spirits carted conveniently away to either heaven or hell.<br /><br /> In \\"The View,\\" a man named Carfax is recovering from a vague illness.  His doctor suggests taking a long holiday at an island retreat.  On the boat Carfax meets a woman who is the sole inhabitant of a small mansion.  She opens her home to him, and they slip effortlessly into an affair.  Carfax is an artist and attempts several drawings around the mansion, becoming alarmed as the surrounding landscape seems to shift somehow from day to day.  Carfax might live forever with his lover in their isolated paradise if only he could accept this disturbing, irrational phenomenon, but of course he can't.<br /><br /> \\"Ringing the Changes,\\" probably an homage to Lovecraft's \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth,\\" tells of a honeymoon couple who choose their destination from a guidebook.  This fateful decision leaves them stranded in the small, dreary, seaside town of Holihaven.  The town is saturated with a terrible, fishy sea-stench; the water has rolled back far from the town, leaving a deep shoreline of muck; and worst of all, the odd inhabitants are obviously up to something infernal with their late-night bell ringing.<br /><br /> These stories have nothing to do with the heavy-handed, popular, shock horror usually associated with the genre.  There are no movie monsters here, no blood-soaked demoniacs or ritualistic serial killers. Aickman's tradition is that of Lovecraft, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad, where the ambient eeriness is enough to stop a heart.<br /><br /> His signature technique is a sort of narrative ambiguity.  If Aickman's characters lose their metaphysical footing along the way, so do his readers.  For instance, in \\"The Houses of the Russians\\" a character has a close brush with fate outside a pub.  Apparently he is nearly run down in the street, and his escape is something of a miracle.  Yet Aickman never gives a clear picture of the scene.  As the man enters the pub, we receive the incident secondhand, just as many of the pub's customers do.  Aickman pulls the rug out from under us, initiating a momentum that sends us scrambling ahead for hearsay, conjecture, the smallest of details--anything that might restore balance.  Once accustomed to his style, we realize that Aickman has managed to shake our imaginations free of their passiveness and has engaged us in an active relationship with his strange world.  Then all that remains is to drift along in an alert but dreamy state with Aickman's voice as our only guide.ly up to something infernal with their late-night bell ringing.<BR><BR> These stories have nothing to do with the heavy-handed, popular, shock horror usually associated with the genre.

When a young boy (the story doesn't give him a name) decides to swap for a friend's goldfish, he finds that his father is the ultimate bargaining  chip--after all, hasn't everyone always wanted to own one?  The boy's  father is such a hot item, in fact, that the neighborhood kids pass him  back and forth, making one deal after another.  Eventually, the mother  sends the boy and his little sister to recover their father (\\"The very  idea,\\" she says), and they follow the swapping trail, redistributing the  trade items as they go.<br /><br /> &quot;The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two  Goldfish&quot; is a brilliantly illustrated adventure map that navigates  the relative values and the strange economy of childhood.  Neil Gaiman's  lively text is written with that special children's logic and fresh humor  found in classics like \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\" and \\"Peter Pan,\\" and the rich  texture of Dave McKean's images--vivid line drawings and colorful  montages--gives the story a look that is unique in children's literature.  This book occupies a special place in my library with a very few picture  books, like &quot;Old Turtle&quot; and &quot;Little Hobbin,\\" that I could  never part with.	2000-08-08

Nanda is a  farmer and blacksmith, a strong, earthy youth rooted in his physical body,  and the contemplative Shridaman is a merchant's son with priestly, Brahman  blood in his lineage. Though the young men are polar opposites, they have a  strong friendship built on mutual admiration and a hint of health  envy.<br /><br /> Their differences manifest during a journey together when the  two men come upon the sight of a beautiful young woman at a remote, ritual  bathing-place. They observe the woman secretly as she bathes, and Nanda  enjoys the sight without shame.  Shridaman, though, is by turns  embarrassed, then inspired.  Mann launches the friends into a hushed  philosophical discussion--a frequent attribute of the novel.  Shirdaman  says, &quot;Yet we are ... guilty if we simply feast on the sight of beauty  without inquiring into its being,&quot; and he promptly falls in love with  the young woman, Sita, languishing over her with the exaggerated fatalism  of the smitten lover in a Shakespearean comedy. Eventually, Sita and  Shridaman are married.<br /><br /> From this scenario springs one of the most  bizarre love triangles in literature, leading to a confrontation with Kali,  earth mother and patron of the body, and later to another meeting, at the  other end of the spectrum, with an ascetic holy man. These powerful  archetypes impel the pendulum of fate back and forth above the three  characters.  Again and again the question is asked: Is it the head or the  body which is most closely linked with the Beloved? Tragedy is  inevitable--visiting the trio more than once--and in the end all hope for  the future lies with Andhaka,  Shridaman and Sita's young son. The boy is a  nearsighted introvert whose quiet innocence hints at some vague potential  for change, for bridging this gap between mind and body.<br /><br /> One  element detracting from the book is the translation (copyrighted in 1941).  While the translation is not entirely without merit--in chapter 5, for  example, the passage describing Shridaman's descent into Kali's dark,  heady, womb-like temple begs to be read aloud--the novel's prose is  sometimes choppy with convoluted, problematic sentence structure.  The  novel's potential among English readers is certainly hampered by its being  long overdue for a new translation.rovert whose quiet innocence hints at some vague potential  for change, for bridging this gap between mind and body.<BR><BR> One  element detracting from the book is the translation (copyrighted in 1941).

Gustav Meyrink's \\"The Green Face\\" is an exhilarating vision of apocalypse.  First published in 1916, the novel sets its action in the near future of post-war Amsterdam, a city brimming with displaced people and with a  stifling atmosphere of unrelenting tension.  At this critical time appears  an enigmatic being named Chidher Green, the mythical Wandering Jew.<br /><br />  Meyrink reworks and amplifies the legend of the Wandering Jew (a being  fated to walk the earth from the days of Christ till the end of time),  portraying his Chidher Green as a harbinger of cataclysmic change both for  the novel's protagonist, Fortunatus Hauberrisser, and for Amsterdam in  general.  The story begins with Hauberrisser encountering Chidher Green in  a magic shop one day, oblivious to his identity. Soon after, Hauberrisser  finds a peculiar chain of old memories and chance encounters erupting  around him. As in a house of mirrors, this one image of a bronze-green face  suddenly appears around every corner. The face becomes a sort of totem of  meditative contemplation (drawing associations with Zen Buddhism).  Finally, Hauberrisser and his companions reach a consensus over the  phenomenon's significance: If one were to attain a spiritual state in which  this face manifested internally, a unique form of transcendence would then  be achieved.<br /><br /> When all is said and done, Fortunatus Hauberrisser  does not prove to be one of Meyrink's most memorable characters.  However,  it is also true that his protagonists are often intended as ciphers.  If  this novel is Meyrink's \\"Book of Revelation,\\" then Hauberrisser  is  certainly his Saint John, valuable largely for his role as privileged  witness to the spirit world's mysteries.<br /><br /> Also, the route  Hauberrisser must take through the story is Meyrink's familiar path of  enlightenment-a moment of sudden spiritual awareness followed by a period  of isolation, which at last leads to promises of a mystical marriage.  Though this path echoes through Meyrink's other work, it would be a mistake  to imagine he is simply repeating himself or relying on a formula here.  Meyrink has a very distinct vision of the soul's progress; and it is this  intense conviction that again manifests so clearly in \\"The Green  Face.\\"<br /><br /> &quot;At the beginning, when we make our first, hesitant  attempts, it is like a mindless groping in the dark, and sometimes we do  things that resemble the actions of a madman and for a long time seem to  lack all consistency. It is only gradually that the chaos forms into a  countenance, in whose varying expressions we can read the will of destiny.  At first they are grimaces, but that is the way it is with all great  matters.\\"through Meyrink's other work, it would be a mistake  to imagine he is simply repeating himself or relying on a formula here.

Whatever, whoever Nog is, I'm not sure that he's human.  If a human being is one step removed from reality-having to interpret the  physical world through the senses and through the mind-then Nog is about  four or five steps removed.  Impressions from the world come in, bounce  around inside his cavernous mind and finally end up distorted beyond  recognition, which is where the fun begins.<br /> Nog strives to maintain a  maximum of three memories, considers facts subjective, and will not, under  any circumstances, give out information. But don't get him started on the  octopus...<br /> &quot;He kept complaining about a yellow light that had been  streaming out of his chest from a spot the size of a half dollar.  We drank  and talked about the spot and the small burning sensation it gave him early  in the morning and about his octopus.  He had become disillusioned about  traveling with the octopus and had begun having aggressive dreams about it.  He wanted to sell it.&quot;<br /> Rudolph Wurlitzer's style is reminiscent  of other writers of the era-Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, et  cetera-and the novel's genre is the good old American \\"yarn.\\"  As with Mark  Twain, Wurlitzer just wants to keep pulling your leg as long as you'll let  him.  This sort of thing is difficult to sustain outside the confines of a  short story, however-and, like some of Twain's novels, \\"Nog\\" does lose a  bit of its steam somewhere.  The opening of the book is absolutely  priceless, but soon Wurlitzer must do something to up the ante in his  narrative con game.  This, unfortunately, means falling back on an listless  plot to move Nog around and add fodder to that bizarre imagination.  If  \\"Nog\\" never quite surpasses the flair of the opening chapters, Wurlitzer  has still achieved a deliciously eccentric style and created one truly  unforgettable character.	2000-06-25

Christopher is rescued as a  boy from an orphanage by Baron Bartholomew von Jocher when the Baron learns  Christopher is a natural mystic, able to take his body into the country of  dreams as he sleeps.<br />The Baron is a Freemason and a free-thinker.  He  lets Christopher develop along his own path, offering only the occasional  piece of advice voiced as Taoist paradox.<br />As Christopher matures, he  finds and looses love, faces the dark side of himself, and finally learns  that his soul has a secret history and a destiny to fulfill which is beyond  anything he could ever have imagined.<br />&quot;The White Dominican&quot;,  though fairly a short novel, is not an easy read the first time through.  It is not at all about linear plot or even about character development.  Meyrink said he wrote his novels &quot;according to the laws of  magic&quot;--and this one perhaps most of all.  The beginning of the novel  shows the strong influence of Dickens (whom Meyrink translated into  German), but after the first few chapters Meyrink has built the story into  something entirely unique.	2000-04-20

This place turns out to be the land of &quot;happily ever after&quot;  where all the legendary heroes and heroines of the past live in leisure and  contentment long after their stories have ended.  James, though, finds one  or two stories left unresolved, and so his adventure begins.<br />Mary  Norton's prose is crisp and well paced, and her characters are very well  drawn.  The story, however, may have turned out more memorable had the plot  become a bit more involved.  The villian of the story, for instance, is  glimpsed only briefly at the tale's end.<br />And of course Brian Froud's  8-10 black and white illustrations are fantastic.	2000-01-26

'In ancient times, in the &quot;time of inspiration&quot;, the poet flew from one world to another,  &quot;riding on dragons&quot;.... They dragged  behind them long tails of dragonsmoke.... This  dragonsmoke means that a  leap has taken place in the poem.  In many ancient works  of art we notice  a long floating leap at the center of a work.  That leap can be  described  as a leap from the conscious to the unconscious and back again, a leap from  the known part of the mind to the unknown part and back to the  known.'<br /><br />So  begins one of the most fascinating books I have read in  the past several years.  Robert  Bly gives us his wonderful idea about  &quot;leaping&quot;, surreal poetry and pays homage to the  modern masters  of this method, largely Spanish poets such as Neruda, Lorca and  Vallejo.  Involved in this idea are the concepts of Wild Association and the presence  of  three brains involved in a complex relationship within the human  mind.<br /><br />After  this book, you will never look at art, any art, the  same way again.	1999-10-30

Gifford's \\"Hotel Room Trilogy\\" contains the two incredible plays filmed by David Lynch for HBO and a third, lesser play.  The tangible mystery of these stories is grounded in peculiar relationships that unfold slowly before us, producing an unrelenting atmosphere of the uncanny.  In \\"Tricks\\" Gifford approaches the psychological territory of Kafka.  We meet two men looking for something more than just sex from a prostitute.  Are the men two halves of a severed personality?  \\"Mrs. Kashfi\\" is the story of Charlie, a young boy who must amuse himself in the apartment of a fortuneteller while his mother consults the woman.  This is the play that was not filmed, and though it is perhaps the least engaging work in the trilogy, the story does contain one unforgettable twist.  \\"Blackout\\" remains my favorite of the plays, and is a story I will cherish forever.  Danny and Diane, have come to New York in 1936 to meet a doctor, a specialist.  Diane has a mysterious problem that has shaken her sanity and dragged the couple through a crucible of grief, burning away everything but an intense, clear-eyed, and sincere love for each other.  In the end, \\"Blackout\\" is story rooted in a very basic relationship, and Gifford packs every line with texture and meaning-a style deeply reminiscent of Faulkner.	1998-05-01
