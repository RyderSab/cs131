I was brought up to look white people in the eye when I had something to say and to never let one of them see me sweat even if I was sweating. But never brought up to be racist. Growing up we had a huge picture of Angela Davis on our living room wall, yet I still love all kinds of people.<br /><br />To read a story like this was very interesting and brought on a whole new look at how people really feel. The story was well told and entertaining. I recommend it to all.	2005-10-10

Frankie Beverly & Maze's Before I let go. So that right there had me hooked.<br /><br />Aside from all that, Ms. Denee really knows how to tell a story. It was put together well and told in away that anyone can relate too.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the sequel! Good Luck in the Future!	2005-09-06

Not being mean, but how in the world did this book get 107 reviews and they are all 4 or 5 stars?<br /><br />It was a very easy read, I read it all yesterday, it just didnt do it for me.<br /><br />It seems as if all the character' where one in the same, I did'nt see anything different in any of them even the men.<br /><br />Klarke to me just was simple, Breezy needed to be smacked and Jeva didnt have the sense God gave her.<br /><br />They act like Klarke is the bomb because she comes up with a plan to lure in a man with money. I guess going to work and getting your own never crossed her mind.<br /><br />Breezy thought it was cool to do whatever whenever with whomever and pay no consequences. Well she was dead wrong!<br /><br />Poor Jeva just wanted to be wanted, but they all talked the same and acted the same.<br /><br />I am sorry I was not feeling this at all! Not to discredit the author I really liked Dollar Bill that is why I didnt mind reading this I just wish someone was honest about it.<br /><br />So, the title is about the only thing I like, because they didnt have anything and were damned if they wasnt going to get it.	2005-08-08

She made a comment that I did not like. I in turn sent an email to the radio personality who at the time was Ms. Jones the former singer.  Anyway she contacted Ms. Woods and she came back on the station to respond to my letter.  A month later she was at our local African American book store LaUnique Books in Camden, NJ.<br /><br />I introduced myself to her and explained who I was, to make a long story short.  I commend Ms. Woods for her writing skills.<br /><br />This story is of a family who loves to hate each other, and anyone else trying to get in there way.<br /><br />I have never been introduced to a more alluring family then the Reigns.  It is the allure of the game that has this family taking over the entire South.<br /><br />There are not many writer' that can pull off a street story, that is not really a street story.  This story is about the drug world but the Reigns are by far from the streets.<br /><br />I won't give up anything from the story because it is just that good, that you have got to read this.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Ms. Woods.	2005-07-23

Actually it gave me a headache.

This story starts out with a little girl trusting in God with all her heart. Believing in the words of the Good Book follow and fear God and all else does not matter.<br /><br />Well Ms. Johnnie was stripped of her innocence and her faith. After being sold to an insurance man for Christmas money, she thought where was God when she needed him.<br /><br />With her questioning her faith she relied on what she knew, and that was how to milk the cow that milked her first. She finds one person she truly believes she loves and the story takes off.<br /><br />If she did learn anything it was to use what you got to get what you want! And that she did!<br /><br />Great Job, Mr. Johnson. I really loved this story.	2005-05-11

Not looking for anything in life but a come up.<br /><br />Du Drop, Muslim, knowing he should be following his faith and listening to his father, but he love's the life as well.<br /><br />These three friends have no clue what they all have in common until they start hating on the one dude that they have been sleeping on! Not realizing who Nephew really is, once they find out they didn't know it was like that! Mr. Banks takes us on a hustle we all have heard of, but don't realize how real it is.

Sincerely Yours is such a good story I am at a lost of words to describe it. If you are a true fan and have read the first two you will really appreciate the story Mr. Banks is giving us. He brought in new characters with a completely different story line.<br /><br />Suave and Sincere relationship is one many people wish for. A man who doesn't cheat or hasn't the whole 10 years now that in itself was great. LOL no really their story was just so good and well put together. The addition of the old characters and their conclusions in this one was a great surprise. If you have not read any of his books honestly you will love all 3 you have to start with NO EXIT in order to appreciate the rest of them. Continued success and much love to Mr. Banks and his family.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of talking to Mr. Banks personally not once did he mention the conclusion to my favorite two street stories.

Being from up North as they would say, you do sleep on down south hustlers because we think the game is different. Well Mr. Sander's proved me completely wrong you can be a gangsta from anywhere.<br /><br />This Story starts off with three friends from the same housing projects, known as stick-up kids looking for a come up. When presented with the best come up they could have imagined, they take Charlotte by the balls and run straight to the net. I applaud Mr. Sanders for this story, although the cover is not so appealing the story so exceeds it. If you are looking for a good street story that keeps it completely real this is one.	2005-04-14

I started at 3:00 p.m. and was done by 9:00 p.m. This is a very good street story about honestly everyday life. Men go to jail all day and year long and the reality of it is the majority of them all have the same thoughts. They will come back out and make it! Cashmere was one of them, you would think after 7 years in federal prison he would have come up with another plan. Once again Mr. Banks did it! He leaves you hanging at the end again, but it is truly worth the read. He puts little boys up to grown men. In reading this you have to stop and think well darn who is the adult here?
