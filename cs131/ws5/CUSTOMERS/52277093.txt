I read it, and mostly enjoyed. What I don't understand, is what authors like Neal Asher and Richard Morgan doing praising this book?  <br />Yes, the novel has cyberjacks, Yakudza, cool shades, kung-fu, etc. There are people, downloading data into their brains and running from the corporations (Johnny-mnemonic, anyone?) <br />There is nothing wrong with all of the above, but it had been done before. The fact, that there are two badass females, and not one, is not enough to make the book stand out. <br />Gibson made his world alive through good prose. Gillers' prose is... well, it just is. As the plot, it's not bad, but it's not inspired, either. I had a small problem, when the book set in the late 21st century started pop-culture references. I can buy Butch Cassidy reference for the merit of the movie. Batgirl - that's going on a limb. But Miss Congeniality? Does Mr. Giller really think that movie will be known 100 years from now? <br />This is all minor, but the thing is, there is nothing major wrong with this book. Or major right with it. Maybe for the post-matrix generation, who haven't heard of cyberpunk before, this book will be a revelation. But if you've read William Gibsons' \\"Neuromancer\\", then you don't need to waste your time on this copy.	2005-09-29

But the way the novel is constructed, it would be more enjoyed by those completely unfamiliar with either book or several movie versions of it.  <br /> <br />First of all, the book is not a horror novel, it's more of a magical realism kind. The characters are often more interested in a philosophical or scientific discussion, then in ... well, doing something. Yes, they have interesting things to say. And I enjoyed it, really. It's just I wish Koji Suzuki saved all this stuff for another book and wrote a thriller here.  <br /> <br />Imagine going into a movie theater to watch a George A. Romero movie, and getting Ingmar Bergman instead. In no way it makes Bergman bad, but there is a high probability you won't enjoy it as much, because you were in a mood for something comepletely different. <br /> <br />Also, there is a large part in the middle of the book, which gives us the complete story of 'Ring'. If you did read it, you can just skip around 20-30 pages. While the position of this overview is logical within the story itself, a lot of readers don't really need it.  <br /> <br />Several reviewers noticed that sometimes the book recaps events, that just happened a couple of pages earlier. Yes, it does that, and it's a bit annoying, really. My theory is that the novel was originaly written in Japan as a serial - ergo these 'previously on 'Spiral' recaps - and then the editors just put it all together. Personally, I would prefer these things to be edited out, because they serve no purpose, except to annoy the readers, and taking them out of the novel. <br /> <br />What we have here, is a non-horror sequel to a great horror novel. As a stand-alone book it's good, but as a sequel it mostly dissapoints. Except for one thing, which singlehandedly earned the book it's fourth star. Remember the magic formula in the first book/movie? The one about what you have to do, to survive? Turns out, it doesn't work!	2005-08-29

And I, personally, started getting a bit tired of all this stuff. But 'Monkeewrench' is way above the rest of the bunch.  <br /> <br />I was attracted by a story, which has the killer coping murders from a computer game. The story is solid, with enough twists and a good ending.  <br /> <br />But the real treat are the characters. Every one of them is a pleasure to follow. This book even has a dog, which is more sympathetic then the main characters in some of the recent bestsellers! And the dialogue is up there with the best of Robert B.Parker. <br /> <br />The mother-daughter team of the authors managed to create a set of characters, whom this reader will love to meet again and again. Not because they have the most amazing adventures imaginable. But because they are fun to be with.	2005-05-30

I think it's the worst thing I tried to read in my life. I feel sorry for the trees, used to print this thing.  <br />Theoretically, it's a thriller. There is a maniac killer, and the uber-detective Alex Cross has to take him. But it's amazingly badly written, and the plot has holes the size of Godzilla.  <br />There are naked bodies being found all other Washington. They are murdered in different ways. But the detective feels that they are connected. Why? 'Cause there is no ID on any of the bodies! Ugh, I don't quite get it. They are naked - what kind of ID he wants to find?? First the victims are black women. Then, a white male shot to death is found. But as he is not only naked, BUT ALSO HAS NO ID ON HIM - the cops know it has to be the same killer! Then they find two dead prostitutes murdered in their flat (all the other bodies were dumped in abandon buildings, bushes, etc.) But, there is no ID on the bodies, so it's the same killer, of course! I don't know, maybe it's common for people in Washington to carry some ID on them even in their homes while being naked. If it's so, then it makes some sense. But not much. Having no ID on the body is too little to realistically link murders with comepletely different MO and no pattern in the victims - are we to believe that when cops find a shot white male, they will instantly connect it to a stabbed black prostitute?  <br /> <br />The language is even worse - when he asks his girlfriend to marry him, she answers -  <br /> <br />`I can't give you an answer.  You just came back from Boston.  You were on another horrible, horrible murder case.  I can't take that.  Your life was in danger again.  That terrible madman was in your house.  He threatened your family.  You can't deny any of that.'  <br /> <br />- I'm not sure people talk like that. It sounds like some 50s noir movie at its worst. And then, there is my favourite phrase, when Cross comes home to here his children, and his Granny singing spirituals: <br /> <br />'Damon, Jannie, and Nana were singing `Sit Down You're Rockin'de Boat' in the kitchen.  The show tune was music to my ears and other essential parts of my anatomy.' <br /> <br />Well, maybe it's just me, but it took me some time to get that he was probably talking about his heart and not what I though at first.  <br /> <br />As I didn't finish this (I got only about 1/3 of the novel), I give it a benefit of doubght, and give two stars, providing that it may have gotten way better later on. But still it's so below any book by the likes of Jeffrey Deaver or John Sandford.	2005-03-31

While reading the book, I caught myself thinking - this could be a good action movie. Sadly, that's the best thing to be said about it.  <br />Maybe I expected too much, but having read several Crais books (including far superior 'Demolition angel') I wanted to read about characters and not only shoot-outs. Sadly, there are no characters here - just some cardboard stereotypes - a haunted cop, his 'loving-but-thinking-about-divorce' wife, his teenage daughter, whom he loves, but can't get through to... you have seen it so many times. The same goes for all other participants of the story. While this can work in a 2 hour movie, it's not that great in a 300+ pages book. <br />The plot is OK, but I just didn't feel involved with it. All the twists of the story made me just curious - how will the author write himself out of this one. And if the book is good you will not be asking this - you will be asking - 'how can the hero get out of this impossible situation? Will he ever?' <br />Read 'A Maiden's Grave' by Jeffrey Deaver to see, what can be done with the hostage situation in a book. Or watch 'The Negotiator'. You woldn't find that kind of tension here.	2005-03-30

Turkish Gambit is the 3rd novel in the Erast Fandorin series published in English (after 'The Winter Queen' and 'Leviathan'),  but actually it's the second in the series.  <br />The book takes place during the Russian-Turkish war in the Balkans and follows the real events, mixing fact and fiction seamlessly.  <br /> <br />There are several things which, I think, contributed to it being published after 'Leviathan'. First - the hero of the series, Fandorin, is not as much of a central figure here, as he is in previouse books. Second - this is more of a war story, then a detective story. There is a search for a spy in the Russian camp, but mostly is about men (and a woman) at war. As a result, the book does qualify as a mystery, but just barely. As was said before (by me, and other reviewers), each Fandorin novel is different in style, and explores another sub-genre of mystery literature. It helps the series remain fresh, but it also can put off some readers, who prefer their mysteries to be more standard in structure: <br />mysteriouse and/or horrible murder - detective takes the case - a pretty girl, related to the victim - some missing files/jewelery/artifact - a chase - some sex - a fight - girl is kidnapped - the villain revealed/girl saved (not saved if she is the villain) - the end. <br /> <br />Sadly, while this book is not formulatic, the marriage of detective fiction and war fiction here is not as exciting and easy-going as the other Fandorin tales. Still, even when this novel drags a bit, it isn't lacking in style.  <br />The war of Russian Empire with the muslim Turkey gives Akunin a chance to speak some thoughts of the West-East conflict in general. These thoughts can be relevant to the current situation in the Middle East, but I have to point out, that in reality they are about Chechnya (the book was written in late 90s).   <br /> <br />P.S. A movie version of 'Gambit' was released in Russia just two weeks before the 1st American edition of the book, andit was an immediate box-office success. If you like the book, you would probably like it, too.	2005-03-11

This could sound as a gimmick, but it's not. Christopher looks at us, 'normal' people, and he sees our drawbacks as singular beings and as a society. The fact that he tells all this in an emotionless account only stresses the point.  <br /> <br />The plot didn't hold many surprises for me, though my girlfriend said that some of the events she didn't expect at all. But it doesn't really matter, if it manages to surprise you or not. Mr. Haddon gave his hero such a strong voice, that you will be drawn to it almost magnetically. You WANT to read his story, not because of the plot, but because of the narative. This is a great strength, which is sadly missing from the majority of books published today.  <br /> <br />I would also like to mention another book, told from the autistic point of view - \\"The Speed of Dark\\"  by Elizabeth Moon. Though it is SF, which can turn some people off, it's a good book, and a worthy follow-up to \\"Dog in the Night-Time\\" if you found the theme interesting. <br />	2005-03-02

But in this common SF setup Adam Roberts tells an uncommon tale. The science is there, but while he gives us the practical aspects of making a planet habitabal, Roberts drives us towards another tale. This is a tale of two human societies, who are so different, that they can hardly understand each other. And from these differences a conflict rises, that grows from heated talk to bloody raids. The novel has two narrators, representing both sides of conflict. From their subjective stories we can try to get an objective picture. <br /> <br />The ending is a bit of a letdown, but it is still an impressive work. <br /> <br />The book was written in 2000, and it is chilling how it seems relevant to the current situation in the world, particularly in Iraq. 'Salt' shows how the worldview of one society can be completely different from that of another. And how unwillingness to understand and blind faith in your way of life being the only right way of life leads to terrible consequences for both sides. <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

Surely, a thriller, which should be a tight-written book by the definition, couldn't be this BIG?? (The first thought, if you are interested, was 'Wow!', because such a big book written by one person impressed me - that was before I laid my eyes on 'Wheel of Time', but I digress). <br /> <br />Well, to be honest, it is NOT a thriller. Now, I'm not meaning it as a drawback, I just want to set the record straight. Yes, there are men with guns and spies and submarines and codes and a very big secret, buried for 50 years, but they are not the point of this book. The point is people ... and codes. <br /> <br />Cryptonomicon weaves two tales - one happening during WWII, another in modern day. They are dealing with several generations of Waterhouse and Shaftoe families (those families later featured in Baroque Cycle, which takes place in earlier centuries). I don't want to give you any of the plot, part lybecause it takes around a hundred pages to get, where it is going, and partly because they are a fun 100 pages! <br /> <br />Stephenson is at the top of his game in this book. He knows, where his plot is going (there are some loose ends, but nothing like the ending of 'Diamond Age'), and he keeps his ramblings in check and manages to make them interesting and understandable. I mean, any author, who can write about the way the visual signal is produced in the computer monitor, and keep non-technical people reading two pages of this description with interest deserves admiration.  <br /> <br />After 'Diamond Age', in which Stephenson so much loved his world, that he forgot the story, this book makes up for all the mistakes. Stephenson was allways good on style, but here it is never put in front of the story itself. <br /> <br />The main achievement is that the book is allways fun to read. Even when dealing with electrons. And as a bonus there is a wonderfull mathemetical formula of horniness. Can you say this about any other book?	2004-11-01

Instead, he finds a dead body. Fleeing the scene, he is captured by the Swiss police. So, it is to be a one-man-against-system book. No, it isn't. And the other thing this book really isn't is a spy thriller. Yes, there are spies and assasins, but this novel is more about their real life and thoughts and choices, then James Bond-like plots and shoot-outs.  <br /> <br />This novel is also about Switzerland, and its role during World War II and its present. For me, this was the most interesting part of the book. <br /> <br />What I didn't like was the latter part of the book. When you read a thriller, there is typically a build-up, presumably leading to some climax. But here Silva robs us of that, making two characters behaving against everything, which was told about them before. At least, one of those characters has an explanation (though it doesn't stand any scrutiny). <br /> <br />A drama about spies can be a good thing, but, sadly, Silva doesn't rise to the level of, say, Alan Furst, John le Carre or David Ignatius.  <br /> <br />It seems like Silva wanted to give us the information more, then tell a story. Maybe a non-fiction book on the topic should be written instead of English Assasin.	2004-09-17

These copies last only a day and you can inload their memories in the evening (if you wish to).  <br />The concept and its influence on our life is well thought-out, and allows the author to have several parallel narrations from the same character. Well, it sounds more confusing, then it actually is. <br />The story itself is a detective one, with a futuristic, but old-fashioned PI Albert Morris as our hero and narrator. realAlbert and his dittoes get involved in several connected investigations , as they are separated, it is up to us for most of the book to put together clues, known to one of him, but not to others. The book reads and feels like a cyberpunk book, but without the cyber part. <br />Some readers might have a problem with the final part of the novel, which turns to the more metaphysical stuff - soul, afterlife, etc. They seem to come from some different book, but still this thing works, and gives novel a far better ending, then most future noirs get. <br /> <br />A worthy novel, with an interesting and intricate world.	2004-08-20

Then comes a mysterious letter from her farther, which tells about some strange things. Thus the events are set in motion - the story of deceit, murder, Chinese Triads and an ancient ruby, believed to be cursed. <br /> <br />This book emulates a story taken from penny dreadfull books of yesteryear, but does it with style to spare. The straightforwardness of plot and the simplicity of characters are part of the package, so I wouldn't consider them a drawback.  <br /> <br />\\"Ruby in the Smoke\\" should be approached with caution by those, who came to know Pullman through \\"His Dark Materials\\". This is a very different book. And it was written with very different aim in sight. Compairing them is hard... imagine compaiaring \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\".  <br />This book doesn't have any fantastic elements. It doesn't have a theological or philosophical ideas.

I don't know how many people waited for him, but I surely did! Victor was last seen in \\"Veritas\\" (now re-issued under the name \\"Bitter Truth\\"). Now, in the beginning of  \\"Fatal Flaw\\" he is called during the night by a close friend, Guy Forrester, who claims someone killed his girlfriend Hailey, while he was in the bath. Would you believe such a story? Neither did Victor, but he still took on defending the man. But not out of friendship. You see, Victor and Hailey had an affair behind the man's back. So he decides to get sure the murderer doesn't get off easy - what's better way to do that, then to be his defense lawyer?<br /><br />Of course, the case turns out to be more complex, then simple lovers quarrel, and soon we follow Victor through the lies and secrets years old, trying to find the  truth of Hailey's past, at the same time questioning her feelings for the men in her life, and the things we take for \\"love\\", but which not always is.<br /><br />In his first outing - \\"Hostile Witness\\" - Victor was a hero of a courtroom drama. \\"Veritas\\" was closer to a noir story. Here Mr. Lashner manages to bring both genres together, taking the best of both worlds. Add to that solid characters, who are always there to give us a good one-liner or a deep philosophical thought, and you get a great novel.<br /><br />There is one thing  -  this time Lashner has a strange liking to saying the same word two times in a row, presumably, to underline the importance. I didn't find it annoying, annoying as some other readers, but it is unnecessary.<br /><br />Apart from that and the one in the title, you will be hard pressed to find any flaw in it.	2004-08-05

The date is not specified, but it should be around 2040. Our protagonist works for a big firm, doing pattern recognition, but a new manager deciedes, that he will be better as a guinea pig for a new method to cure autism. So, this looks like a thriller, a man against the system, that kind of thing.<br />But it's not. This story, told from Lous' point of view, is a tale of his trying to understand 'normal' people. And it's a wonderful look on people, which managed to paint the autistic persons more human, then the 'normal' ones. Lous' attempts to understand human behaviour, to see patterns in it are very interesting, and gave me food for thought for a long time to come. <br />There are several drawbacks to the novel. <BR>One is the black and white colors of the characters, which make the bad guys of the novel more caricatures, then realistic characters. While it can be justified by the overall structure and purpose of the novel, I would liek them, at least, not to be so in-your-face-arrogant-SOBs.<BR>Another drawback for me was the adrupt ending of the book. I won't get into the details, but at one point Lou had to make a very seriouse decision. The results of it are given just a couple of pages, and one of the storylines, which was very important, and a delight to read, got only ONE SENTENCE!<br />Still, this book told me a lot, not only about autistic people, but also about myself.

Historical mysteries are not the easiest books to write and, from my point of view, a novel in this genre can turn only two ways - a great one or a bad one. Also, as I am Russian, a foreigner writing about my countrys' past... well, let's just say, that some books about Russia, I've read were laughable in there depiction of the country.<BR>Luckily, all my suspisions were proven wrong. <BR>The book starts with two bodies found on the ice of Neva river on the first day of 1917. St. Petersburg is a frozen city on a brink of revolution. The government is in dissaray, as people think not of how to prevent a revolution, but how to save themselves when it comes. In comes Alexander &quot;Sandro&quot; Ruszki - the Chief Investigator. He is one of those officers, who will hunt down the truth whatever it takes. And pretty soon the trail takes him to rather high places...<BR>But the book is not just a mystery - it's a story about people, who got caught in extraordinary moment in history - about love, honor, trust and hard choices you sometimes has to do to survive.<BR>The recreation of the place and period is near perfect. There are some minor issues, but I don't think that any reader outside of Russia will notice them. <BR>This is a very strong book, weaving a story around the real facts and persons.

True, a car chase or a shoot-out are exciting, but when the hero has to outthink his adversary, not just shoot him ... well, that excites me more.<BR>\\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is, maybe, the ultimate battle of wits novel. <br />A young girl goes into a shrink office.

But does he stand a chance against a psychopath who can talk people into committing suicides?  <br />\\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is more of a suspense novel, then a thriller - there is not much actual action - i.e. fights, chases, - mostly it's talking, but it's really involving. Maybe not as involving as another Deaver great \\"A Maiden's Grave\\", but the difference in suspense is minimal. <br />And not many novels can give you a scene, were the hero has to argue, why a person should not be shot, not plead, or appeal to reason, but really give an argument. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. <br />The one thing I can say against the book is that the villain sometimes seems to be too clever, unrealistically so, but if that wasn't a problem for you in the Hannibal Lector novels, then it won't be a problem here also.<br />One last thing: ordinary it takes me about a week to read a 300 pages novel, as I don't have much time to read with work and everything.

Here the term has another meaning. The novel takes place in New Crobuzon - a megapolice as great as any in our world. The city with its train stations, dumps and red light districts is as much a character in this novel as others. <BR>The plot takes its time to really start. It's not that nothing happens for the first several hundreds of pages - it's that those events are rather slow and serve to set the scene for later events (think part 1 of Tad Williams' &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; where for 200 pages we followed a boy living in a castle and his daily chores). <br />The characters are interesting if not overly original. Isaac - a young scientist, who was marked as &quot;crazy scientist&quot; by some of the reviewers is a rational person, trying to understand the universe and its' mysteries. To him comes a garuda (birdman) named Yagharek (and NOT Grimnebulin like one review said, that's really Isaacs' surname - Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin! How did they read the novel, if they don't know the name of one character from another?). Yagharek has no wings, and asks Isaac to find a way - any way, to give him back flight. This triggers the series of events, some of which are spectacularly scary. But still, this novel has more in common with Peake and even Dickens, then Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks. <BR> <BR>The author has a great imagination and he puts it to full use here, creating many interesting races and building the city from scratch. Among characters worth mentioning are an Ambassador of Hell, the Weaver (a very interesting creature), Council (who will come into action late in the novel, so I won't tell any more about him).<br />New Crobuzon looks as real as any city you visited, and it's populated with many colorful characters. And though the book felt overlong in places, by the end of it I new that I'd love to make another visit to this strange and yet familiar land.	2004-05-25

Here he confirms his reputation with a stellar novel about death penalty case and people caught in it.<BR>Turow stopped writing legal thrillers somewhere around his third novel. I mean it in the sence, that he is not writing about a crime or an investigation, they are used in his novels to look at the law establishment and the society in general. Thus, the readers who look for car chases, conspirasies and other Hollywood-style stuff are often dissapointed. But people looking for thoughtfull reflection on many important issues, a novel inhabited with living, breathing people are in for a treat.<br />The book starts with a person, sentenced to death, getting his last chance at appealing the verdict. He claims to be innocent (after keeping silent for years). The problem for his newly appointed lawyers is that their client allready confessed the crime, and he is also not the most sane person. The novel then cuts to the past, and shows us the other side - a detective and a prosecutor.<br />Cutting back and fourth Turow gives us both the defence and prosecution, and he managed to make them interesting and sympathetic. So you don't just root for one side - somehow you end up rooting for both, and that makes the conflict more intense.<br />But this story is not only about trial, it's about people  - attorney, prosecutor, judge, detective - caught in a focal point in their lives, where they find that maybe, some of the errors they made in there lives, can be reversed.	2004-05-14

For some reason &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot; was passed over in the American edition, may be, it will be published at a later date. Fear not, though. The novel is totally accessible on its own, you don't even need to know the events of &quot;Winter Queen&quot;. <br />Each novel in the series is a take on another sub-genre of mystery story - there are spy stories, political stories, etc. Here Akunin enters the kingdom of Agatha Christie - if you have read a Poirot mystery, you know what to expect from &quot;Leviathan&quot;. This novel could be a Poirot mystery - it is worthy of the Queen of the mystery herself. If it were, would it be her best? No. But it won't be worst, too. <br />The main thing I like about Akunin is that he is writing novels not only set in the past, but imitating the style of that era. Most of the authors today try to cram everything into a novel - mystery, thriller, family saga, etc. The Fandorin books have a kind of simpler, purer feel to them. And thus they are somehow more pleasant to read then the majority of page-turners. <br />Modern thrillers are often compared to a wild ride. Well, instead of that, try a comfortable journey on a luxury cruiser. <BR>The &quot;Leviathan&quot; will be leaving port shortly! Refreshments and murder are served on board.	2004-04-27

Not least among them are the fact that her husband was eradicated (not killed, just the nearly fatal accident he had at the age of two was made COMPLETELY fatal) and the end of the world, which is imminent in a matter of days. <BR>This sequel to &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; has all the fun of the original novel and even more characters from literature, including Miss Havisham from &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and Cheshire Cat. There is also a visit to Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot; and many otther, not so obviouse, references and puns. <BR>Those who loved the original novel will be immensely pleased by this one. The characters are two-dimensional, but it's deliberate here, so can't be considered a drawback. And also, does it really matter if the characters are two-dimensional, if we have so much fun with them?<BR>The plot is solid (if yo accept jumping in and out of books, genetically ingeneered dodos and charecters from Jane Austin asking for AA batteries), but is a bit below the high plank of the first one. That's due to two things: <BR>1) the lack of novelty, due to the fact that mostly the novel develops the ideas introduced in the first one;<BR>2) there is no great opponent on par with Asheron Hades here.<br />Still, this is one of the rare breed of books - humor written for people, who like to read. And it's written by a person who shares our love for books. If i could jump into any book, I guess a Thursday Next adventure will be my first choice.	2004-04-07

The HP books are so popular, because they bring out our childhood dreams while still staying (at least, partially) grounded in everyday world we know. The adventures of Thursday Next are build on the premise of being able to enter the works of fiction and interact with the characters. If you ever dreamed about this - you'd love the book. Also the &quot;real world of Ms.Next (I mean, outside the books) is a treat for a book-lover. With tidbits like collected cards not of football players, but of book characters. I enjoyed every page of this novel!<BR>Make no mistake, this book has as much to do with pulp stories as it has with the classic literature of ages past. And while I would love the characters to be more three-dimensional, I don't find the lack of depth of characters to be a drawback of this book. The sheer number and imagination of Ffordes ideas helped me to get lost in a good book.	2004-02-26

But it definetely won't be the last. The novel starts with a line which goes like: &quot;Joe Smith died because he felt brave.&quot; Then we have a tight scene describing the situation farther... That's the way to fire off a thriller!<br />In this book Jack Reacher is a by-stander grabbed by the  kidnappers of a young FBI agent. As the author tells all the critics of coincidenses being at the heart of the novel: @It was a freak chance.&quot; Truthuly, I don't like coincidences in books, too, but I can forgive them in a good one. This is one of those. Why did the bad guys kidnap a FBI agent? What is being built in a room in a remote Oklahoma location? And who is the man, who cruelly kills the workers, after they completed building?<br />Mr. Child wrights with sureness of a seasoned author, and when he takes a rest from plot turns he gives you the action scenes most authors would die trying to reproduce. It is a rare author indeed, who can talk about velocities, weapon parts and all the technical data, and still keeping it exciting.<br />There are minor points which cost the book one star in my opinion - the main being some things coming out of the blue in the last pages of the novel (these things concern Holly, and I won't say any more of them), but this is really a strong thriller, with a solid plot, hard-as-nails protagonist and the book equivalent of bullet-time scenes of Matrix.	2004-02-13

The story defies description in a few words, and moreover, you don't want to read what it's about. <br />But it starts with a pizza delivery man who works for mafia (and mafia here is official), but who is also an uber hacker. <BR>And for his antagonist - how about a guy, with an a-bomb strapped to his bike, and a chip in his head - if he dies, the bomb goes off. <BR>Mixing &quot;Matrix&quot;-style action (allthough it was written years before &quot;Matrix&quot;) and &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;-like revelations about history and religion this book will delight fans of cyber punk and other readers alike.	2004-01-20

Six people are travelling together and tell each over their stories, which brought them to the trip. It sounds simple but isn't. The stories are all different and each of them is great. It's not obviouse at first, but these tales represent the evolution of SF. We have a lost diary kind of horror story, not unlike Lovecraft, then there is military SF in the vein of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; or Gordon R.Dicksons' Dorsai novels then ... well, maybe you'd better find out by yourself.<br />The world of this novel is very well written and it feels like a real future, not some stock footage you find in many other novels. There was a lot of thought put into the universe of this book. <br />Hyperion is followed by 3 more books - Fall of Hyperion, Endimion, Rise of Endimion. Many readers were put back by a complete change of style in the second book. So you'd better be ready for a VERY different second novel, which is still good. <br />The Hyperion cantos is one of the definate SF cycles of the late 20th century. If you read even a bit of SF (and judging by your being on this page you do), you should take a trip to this world.<BR>It is definetly up there with &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot; and a couple of others.	2004-01-13

Not so here.<br />I won't say what Lira and Will faced in their journey here, because I really don't want to ruin the surprise. I'd only like to remind readers that this series is no ordinary one, even in its structure - can you remember another trilogy, which didn't give us one of the main characters (Will) untill volume 2?<br />There are also: an assasin, several new races, revelations about the nature of Spectres, a grand battle with the Kingdom of Heaven... <br />Well, what are you still reading the review for?

Rarely can you read something with as well-realised world (even worlds) as this one. <br />We start in a kind of Victorian Oxford in a world were people have damons - which, while being separate, are a part of human being (it's too hard to explain this in several words, but it's not very comlicated, really). Our heroine is Lyra - a small girl, who will soon go on a great journey. Though it may sound like a kiddie book it is NOT. The book is mature in tone (espesially in later volumes) and may be not suitable for younger kids. For example, there is a scene where a bear catches and eats a seal. While not graphic, it's not something you'll often find in a book for children.<br />One of the strongest points of the trilogy is that it doesn't follow standard structure. For example, we won't meet some of the main characters untill the second book, and the third volume also holds enough surprises and new characters.<br />The books not only give us a wonderful universe, but also raise some questions, including religion and church which make some of the readers brand the books as anti-christian. In my opinion, this is not the case. Then again, if you consider books about Inqusition or \\"DaVinci Code\\" a threat to your fate, then you won't like this one. But, really, you should try to change your viewpoint, 'cause you will be missing a lot!	2004-01-05

And there is a lot of action thrown in, if the mystery is not enough for you.<BR>While some readers critisized the book for being too graphic in depicting sex and violence, I didn't have problems with those issues. Maybe I'm more tolerant, or maybe I thought that for the man like Takeshi this was the right way to narrate his story. He is a mercenary, who has been through several horrible wars - do you expect him to be poetic, while describing sex? <br />Overall, this book is one of the strongest SF thrillers I've read in a long time, may be since \\"Snowcrash\\".

His Kenzie/Gennaro series, of which \\"Sacred is the 3rd novel, is THE noir series of the decade. The writing is smoothe and sure, the jokes are funny, the heroes are sympathetic. Basically, this is an ideal private dick series.<BR>Well, I've praised Lehane enough for one review, now more about the book itself. First of all, as the 3rd book of the series it's better to be read after \\"A drink before the war\\" and \\"Darkness, take my hand\\". It's not necessary, but it's better that way, at least 'cause some of the previouse events are mentioned and if you read those novels after this one it could ruin some strong plot surprises in them.<BR>'Sacred' finds our heroes on a search for a missing heiress. Of course, when a lot of money is involved, nothing is what it seems, and nobody can be trusted. The plot of the book, while strong, is not very original, but Lehane's writing moves it up to a whole new level. You care for the characters, and that's a major point for the book.<BR>Towards the end of the novel there are some scenes which ring a bit false for my ear, and that's what cost this book a star. Basically, coupled with the plot, it could've cost it two, but the way Lehane managed to use a religiouse cult as part of the novel, without putting it in the center of it, earned him one star back.<BR>Bottomline: Not the best in the series, but still way above most other writers.	2003-12-12

Brite compared it to a gothic cathedral on fire, and that's really an accurate description. Here we have a book which is dripping atmosphere. While this can annoy some readers - who prefer a fast-moving plot to a well-developed one - I think it's their loss. <br />Kiernan's command of language is truly amazing. If you tried to simply retell the plot of this novel you'd get a rather simple story, and not much scary, too. But the author takes some elements you've read before a hundred times and somehow transforms them into vivid memorable images.<br />The horror genre was explored by so many authors, that it's hard to find a truly original novel. But &quot;Silk&quot; clearly demonstrates, that if you take good characters and write about them with passion and grace, you can get fantastic results.<br />Also it helps if the writer can substitute phrases like  &quot;spiders covered her&quot;, for &quot;she was covered with thousands tiny lives, scratching with a billion legs&quot; - do you feel the difference?	2003-12-05

And then the next narrator comes and casts a new light on the situation.<BR>All the voices are distinct, and there are some good surprises on the way, also the historic period is well-researched. This is not some pseudo-history... well, it is, but one of very high quality.<BR>If it was a history novel - I'd give it full five stars and then some. But this is a mystery, and as such it has several serious problems.<BR>In the beginning of the novel we learn that the first narrator decided to tell about the events he witnessed years ago. Then, he sent his recollections of the events to the next narrator, who told the story from his point of view, etc. There is NO reason for these recollections to appear in the first place, and the more we learn about our narrators, the less reason they have to describe these events. The third narrator questions the appearance of these accounts, but the book never answers why the characters decided to share this story, and why each of them sent his recollections to the next narrator and not to some other person. <BR>Also, one of the main parts of any mystery is the answer to it. The answer here is, for my taste, unsatisfactory. While the mystery itself is solved, there is suddenly too much mysticism, which turns the novel into a light historic fantasy (I know it sounds too vaque, but saying more will be telling too much, and that's not good, when you are talking about 600+ pages book).<BR>Honestly, I felt cheated. Thus the final score. Still, I'll buy other novels by the author. He CAN write a mystery novel. And I hope that he can come up with a mystery worth writing about.<BR>Bottom line: a good recollection of an era, but an unsatisfactory mystery.	2003-11-26

The Fifth Harry Potter book is not the best in the series. That said I still enjoyed reading it a great deal. <br />If the Potter series was a trilogy this would be a second part. Mostly the book doesn't do anything, but setting the scene for the later volumes. The tone of the book is darker then before and the enemies faced by characters are more internal then external here. Thus there is not much actual plot in the way of previous novels. Not that it's a dull reading. J.K. Rowling created an engaging cast of characters, which can keep you reading even without enough plot. While most characters remain true to themselves, Harry in the novel is changed. He is always nearly boiling with anger directed at anyone close to him. Yes, this is obvious his coming of age, but why does it have to happen every few pages, and why doesn't it happen to Ron? Harry's constant anger was a bit annoying.<br />On the other hand, the way Harry's relations with Cho are handled is exceptionally good. I think it's important for young readers to know that such things can happen. There are also some interesting points raised about Harry's father, which, hopefully will be developed in the remaining novels.<br />I still love this series dearly, but hopefully the remaining volumes will have more plot. Also, I really hope, that it would take the author less then 3 years to write the next one.	2003-11-21

For me &quot;intelligent thriller&quot; is sinonimouse to &quot;clever&quot; and, thankfully, such novels are not that rare. I'd call it an INTELLECTUAL thriller. It's main strength and most dazzling parts are not action, but historical theories.<br />Now, that's refreshing. Many novels were based on different historical theories, but it's the first one to make the theory the center of the novel, and not just a background for shooting and explosions.<br />I enjoyed reading this novel a great deal. The pace of the novel is good. There is not much in the way of actual action - it's mostly talking, really, but it's engaiging talking.<br />As the novel touches upon history of the christianity, I believe, that some people will find it offensive. But in reality it's no more offensive then some historical novel about Inqusition in that it doesn't say anything against Christian faith, but raises some questions with catholic church.<br />The main drawback of the novel is that Mr.Brown played with the actual facts to fit them better into his theory. While this is allright in any other book, it's NOT in this kind. It's the same as playing with numbers in your accounting.	2003-11-14

The problem - no one believes her, and the cops want her to stay out of their business. But she can't just drop it and starts looking for answers. Looking for justice for the woman, who was mercilessly killed.<br />This novel is surprisingly good, especially for a first-time writer. Being a pathologist herself, Reichs manages to give us not the clinical, but the creepy description of the minuta of the job. <BR>The characters are realistic and interesting, and the occasional humor is well-placed. <br />The plot of the novel is tight and it's a character-driven story, well, for most part. The ending is also solid, apart for a bit too much coincidents, but they don't spoil it too much.<br />Compaired to Cornwell, I like Reichs WAY better. This novel was more involving than &quot;Postmortem&quot; that started Kay Sarpentera series. Also, the book managed to make me feel compassion and sorrow towards victims of the killing, while in most procedure novels there are no victims - just bodies.	2003-11-11

This premise is not very realistic, as is the novel itself. But it's a fun James Bond - like yarn.<br />Everything is large scale, bigger than life, etc. Nevertheless, the charactes are likeable, the scenery is nice and the action swift. This is no Forsythe or Le Carre, and it's less intricate than Ludlum, and has no geopolitics, so Clancy comparison is strange. Lions should be compared to Bond or Jon Lands' Blaine McKracken - and Scott Harthath is on the level with those guys.<br />Bottom line: Basically, this book is a Hollywood action blockbuster on paper - not very intelligent, but swift and pretty. <BR>And, let's face it, we still like such movies.	2003-11-10

I enjoyed reading it. It is a sold Crichton book, and a good beach or plane read.<BR>The thing is ... it's not original enough to earn more than 3 stars. Crichton, while not being a great novelist (let's face it, his characters are not very well developed, they are just there, so the plot can move), nearly allways in the past was original. Before Crichton we haven't read about deadly viruses, nearly sentient gorillas (not counting &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; or several comic-book characters), or dinosaurs in the modern world.<BR>But deadly nanomachines ... well, we even had Mulder and Scully dealing with the problem in one of original X-files novels (&quot;Antibodies&quot;). The fact that the nanotechnology is not a novel idea in books is not, of course, the authors fault, but it makes the scientific aspect of the novel (which allways was one of Crichtons strong points) less interesting.<BR>Also, I found the first part of the novel a bit too long. This is the part of the novel, which shows the life of the mysterious occurances, and the main character wondering about what's going on, etc. It is well written. But let's face it - you've read the back cover, so you allready know the reason behind all this.<BR>That's the problem with many of todays novels, or maybe not novels, but books. Having to sell them, the publishers put too much information on the cover, and sometimes it spoils the experience of reading. I think that when it comes to Crichton or King, the publishers can wet our interest not by giving away plot points, but by surrounding the book in mystery - like the 5th Harry Potter book. If I've approached this book without any information about what i'll find inside, I would've definetly enjoyed it more.	2003-10-30

And for people who have read enough it's the same as giving away the plot.The idea of information as a weapon is not novel, but it is well argued here. Definetly, with the development of technology such use of history is possible.<BR>If this short novel was a part of an anthology - I would have nothing to say against it. But I won't say that you have to buy the anthology just to read it.<BR>It's a pleasant enough read, it's just can't be priced the same as 'Alienist'. Take it out of the libriary, but don't buy it.	2003-10-30

It really butchered the book, changing its core elements into something quite different and less interesting.<BR>This book is the closest you get to Hitchcock, without watching the movies. The main character is an ordinary man, who is face with the order: &quot;We have your daughter, we are watching you, do as we tell you and don't say a word, or we'll kill her&quot;. <BR>Thus he is sent on a task he doesn't understand, and he is trying to deduce the wereabouts of his daughter and the mystery of the number the villains are trying to get out of his patient in a mental hospital. <BR>The pace of the novel is superb, and the language is perfect for this kind of book. This is really  the kind of book to keep you through the night.<BR>The situation the characters are put in is really your worst nightmare - when the violence shatters your cozy little world, and you have to fight for everything you hold dear.<BR>This book is equal to &quot;Marathon Man&quot; by William Goldman, shame it didn't manage to get as good movie version as that novel.	2003-10-27

He is literally the last man on Earth - all other men died in a second of mysterious causes. The story, which seems to be the ultimate male fantasy, is really a thriller boarding on horror. It's not a dream - it's a nightmare!<BR>There are women, who consider the death of men to be the will of Mother Earth, and so they'll do anything to get the planet rid of the last one, then there are Israeli commandos, and ... oh, no, I won't spoil it for you!<BR>Considering the premise, the tone of the story itself is surprisingly realistic, and the dialogue is superb.<BR>This story is better in the collected form - this is the way to read Y, and not to read a chapter once a mounth.<BR>Compaired to the first story arc, this one is less dramatic, but mostly because it deals with a smaller cast and scale. <BR>There are talks of &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; movie. I, personally, think it's too early to make a movie, 'cause the series has just started. And it shouldn't be a movie - a series of movies, or better a TV series.	2003-10-23

And Robert dashes around Rome in a race against time to save Vatican which is literally sitting on a bomb.<BR>This novel has as much information input as the DaVinci Code, but far more action. The pace is good, but sometimes I found that a change from a shoot-out to a lecture on Michelangelo is a little disorienting and somehow stretches suspension of diesbelief ... also the final part of the novel seem to feature a plot turn for every page.<BR>This is a good novel, but the plot is a bit too complex for its own good.<BR>Seems like mr.Brown didn't trust the intellectual discoveries to be interesting enough to keep the reader, so he put in enough action to satisfy a James Bond fan.<br />A minor point - there is a SPLENDID UK cover for this book with a great logo for the title (which nicely ties in with the Illuminati theme within) Go to the amazon-uk and at least look at it ...	2003-10-22

And this style, plus a sympathetic cast are the main draws of this novel, as well as later volumes of the series.<BR>I'm mystefied by reviewers, who state that the plot of the novel kept them guessing ... for me it was mostly obviouse ... well, maybe Russian mind works in other ways then Western ...<BR>Still, as I've stated the style is very good, and it's enough to keep you reading, like, for example a Robert B. Parker novel, which also should be read for its characters and dialogue.<BR>In the following novels Akunin showed (or should I say will show, as they are not yet translated) other styles, used in books of the time. Every novel in the series is narratively different from others, but not one of them is bad.	2003-10-22

Not this one! You see, before turning to banking he was a marine, and he also participated in secret assasination operations for US government (and you better be interestd in these operations, 'cause they are described throughout the novel, allthough they are not connected to the main plot). Hey, maybe this guy can have adamantium claws, too? Like Wolverine - now that could be fun! And it's realistic, if they do it in the movies - must be real, right?<br />The villain of the novel is ... well, he is EVIL. He is rich, an Islamic fanatic and a personal friend of Saddam Husein ... the problem is (in real life, that is), that Hussein had driven all of the Islamic religiouse leaders from Iraq, when he came to power, Iranians considered him to be an enemy of Islam, so I can't see an Islamic traditionalist to be a friend and sponsor of such a leader (than again, he is EVIL, and having him as a friend makes our vilain EVIL, too) <br />And, of course, there is a bomb for sale from the former USSR, just like in any other unoriginal thriller.<br />TO the authors credit, there is some good action in the final part of the novel, but it's just too late ...	2003-10-18

This is a VERY different kind of novel.<br /><br />Basically, it's a caper. A corporation hires main characters to hack into computers of their rivals. Not to steal information, but as a revenge for using stolen designs. Of course, it's not that simple, but you get the idea.<br />This novel was first published in 1989 and it aged rather well. Many thrillers that utilized technology in 80s-90s are nearly impossible to read today, because they tend to explain such things as 'modem' and 'e-mail' to, presumably, ignorant readers.<br />Sandford doesn't. He gives enough of explanation to satisfy people with minimum computer knowledge, but doesn't tend to explain everything.<br /><br />This is not a book that leaves you breathless, it's just a fun read with sympathetic characters.<br />I think it's perfect for a train ride or a plane flight. I'll definetly read other Kidd novels (The Empress File and The Devil Code), but, how should I put it, they are not very high on my list.<br />If this was a new book - I would have given it 3 stars. But it gets extra star for being still readable after more than 10 years. Most thrillers that deal with technology become annoying in 5.	2003-10-17

This is le Carre of comic books, really.<BR>Tara Chase is a British agent, sent to assasinate a rogue Russian general, who turned into an arms dealer. <BR>This book doesn't give you high-reaching conspiracies and years-old secrets, the conflict plays out much like it would in real life. But it doesn't make it less exciting.<BR>The art is very good. It seems cartoony at first, but it somehow  manages to conway emotions very clearly, in fact, more clearly than realistic art, found in most action-adventure comics.<BR>Queen &amp; Country started as a mini-series, but was turned into an ongoing comics.

But after reading the reviews I desided to give it a try.<br />Am I glad of that!<br />It recreates athmosphere of the era as good as Alan Furst, and the blend of fact and fiction is very intriguing. The characters are well-drawn and realistic (and believe me, very few American writers can write realistic Russian characters, and not Crazy Ivan stereotypes).<br />The characters are not in the way of the action, but the action also doesn't get in the way of characters. These people have reasons for the things they say and do, and these are personal reasons, and not just moving the plot.<br />I'm not sure in some of the geography of the novel (I think that distances between Moscow, Novgorod and Leningrad wouldn't allow the characters to cover them in the time it took them in the novel)- but that's the only point against the novel I can think of.<br />This is one of those novels that prove, that a great thriller, doesn't have to be &quot;as current as the headlines&quot; - great story and great characters matter far more!	2003-10-15

But, that was then, and this is now. And from my point of view this book lost at least part of its appeal.<br />Most characters are three-dimensional and interesting, but Kay, being a woman in a men's world and having to prove herself every step of the way ... well, you've read it and seen it in movies more than once.<br />When this idea was novel (and i guess it was in '91), it was good, but now it only serves to underline the stereotipically stupid male in a position of power, who does everything to make her work harder (and to do that he does things too stupid and damaging to his own career).<br />So, we have a sub-plot which weights down the novel, we also have to read through passages telling us in detail how it is possible to access your computer at work from your computer at home.<br />The novel is told in first person, but it seems somehow clinical. We have dead mutilated bodies, but Kay is more conserned in proving herself, then stoping a serial killer.<br />There IS a good mystery in this novel, with a clever answer.<br />But for me it was not worth the novel attached to it.	2003-10-10

I think that for those, who really was there it will be even better.<BR>Glimpses is not fantasy in ebveryday sence. I'd say it's magical realism, not unlike Jonathan Carrol or Haruki Murakami. <BR>And the thing that makes it really great, is that it can convey to you the feeling of listening to the best music that never was, and I can't think of many authors who can wright about music so vividly. That's a tremendous achivement.<BR>In short: this book lets you glimpse another world. And it as real as this one. I don't know how Mr. Shiner does it. It's a kind of magic	2003-10-04

Basically, it could be called urban fantasy, allthough, it shouldn't be, considering that the action takes place in a small town in New Mexico.<br />So, it should be rural fantasy, I think.<br />This is not unlike the works of Tim Powers and James P. Blaylock.<BR>So, if you like them - give &quot;Dry water&quot; a shot. <br />I found the main character sympathetic, allthough the romantic storyline was rather perfunctory. But the magic IS there in this novel, as are some interesting persons (not all of them alive), and the story of the antagonist, when told, rises interesting points.<br />This book has intelligence, controlled lightnings and one annoying, though good-natured ghost - what more do you need?	2003-10-04

I mean, can you imagine SEALs going into Russia on a black operation which is not against Russia, but China! And they kill citizens of Russia, destroy Russian ships ... and the Russians lnow who is behind this, they just can't prove it. So they do nothing .... riiiiiiight ... <BR>And all this is done to stop chinese from using the submarines in the taiwan straight, because this subs are so powerful, so scaaary!!! So scary, in fact, that one american sub takes a pair of them in a couple of minutes in one scene! <BR>And the SEALs operation inside Russia ... it was just dull ... we just had this supersoldiers carrying immense weights this way and that, and then diving and attaching explosives to ships...<BR>And no one stopped and thought abought civilians, killed in all this operation.<br />Bottom line: Mr. Robinson knows his subs, but he doesn't know politics, and he doesn't care about people	2003-02-15

The story is okay, and could have made a good episode if it was filmed then, in the 60-s. Now it feels outdated. Also, it never should be a novel, but a short story, like those James Blish adaptations of original episodes.<BR>At least then, with the loss of some scenes, the ending could be more convincing (SPOILER: the characters discussed a biblical scene once in a place where Joy Machine must have heard them, and in the end Kirk described the SAME scene to convince the Machine to turn off).<BR>Lastly, I didn't like Mr. Gunn's style and it seemed to me he isn't very familiar with Trek universe. For example, Kirk said that he couldn't help the population of Timshel because of Prime Directive, although the planet is a member of Federation.	2001-09-08

First of all, it deals a lot with the events and characters of the those novels, and second...it is not as intriguing as those two books. I liked it, but that's because I am fond of the characters, especially Troy himself. Starting the book, I expected to find a web of intrigue, but the events mentioned on the back cover happened only after several hundred pages! Until then we had Troy's reflections on life, death, etc.  What we have here is a good, clever novel about the 60's, just don't expect it to be a thriller it isn't.	2001-03-07

I am Russian,so I'm always sceptical about american novels taking place in Russia(double sceptical,when the main  character is Russian,too).But this novel surprised me mostly with the  authors knowledge and understanding of Russian people and Russian soul.It  seems, as if he studied Russia for ages, and it paid out.This one is more  than a thriller- it's a story of Europe in one of it's darkest hours and  about people facing choices.If you want to REALLY know what Russians are  like- read this one.	1999-06-09

There are no sudden plot developments, and the main mystery of the novel is reveald close to the middle of the book.It's not boring, just not exciting  enough for my taste.I have read Baldacci before,so I know he can do  better.If this was my first Baldacci novel, I think it could have been my  last,also.Hope the next one will be better.
