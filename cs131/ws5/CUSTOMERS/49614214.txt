I'm glad Benton is back, the books weren't the same without him.  I like the two new characters as well.  The ending was too fast, and wasn't satisfying, however,  I have read a lot of books worse than Blowfly.  I was very happy to have bought the book and I don't understand why the reviews are so totally bad.  I read this book in less than 24 hours and eagerly await the next book.	2004-03-20

The Big Gamble is a wonderful addition to the series.  I liked the inclusion of Clayton and his family with Clayton having a bigger role in the book.

The book that I didn't like in this series was Justice.  I thought Decker was to hard on Christopher and was unhappy with the ending.  I was glad to read about him and Terri again. I choose to view Christopher as someone who has survived the best way he could and by some incredible odds has some redeeming qualities.  Some of the men that he took out were pure evil.  I also think that Decker has some weaknesses of his own.  He definitely took the easy way out by allowing Jonathan's brother-in-law to die a hero, but then talks about revenge in the future.  He used Donatti but condemned him for his help.  I think that is a very self-serving attitude. Peter and Rina were certainly happy with the news that the world had one less child molester.  I guess Peter wants to avenge that illegal act also.	2002-09-26

It contained material that seemed to be recycled from earlier books and detailed descriptions of Bob's poop.  We went from Bob's poop to Bob's puke.  Not much improvement at my house.  If there is a dumber main character than Stephanie Plum, I've missed the book.  She is such a colossal screwup and gets worse at being a bounty hunter instead of better.  I wasn't surprised that Ranger broke off the affair after one night.  Stephanie is incompetent at everything else, this seemed to be more...than a passionate affair.  Kloughn would be more her speed than Ranger or Joe.  Stephanie has gone from cute, endearing, gutsy to boring, incompetent, and about as smart as her grandmother who has also lost her charm. Book eight is more original than seven.  For that I rated it a 2-star, but it wasn't worth the price of the book.	2002-08-14

The ending with him, of course, with a single crashing blow breaking the neck of the killer and the F.B.I. saying \\"now we own you\\", well this part wasn't even a one star.

Everytime I read a couple pages I kept thinking that I'd read this before and which book is this like.  I felt like someone pulled pages out of another book and changed the name of the secondary characters.  I can't believe that anyone would be so obsessed with Bob's bowel movements.  With the exception of Stephanie's sister, this book was totally disappointing.  I've read all six of her other books and laughed particularly at book 2, however, Bob's poop isn't cutting it.  Joe was great as always until the end of the book, and well I guess Janet had to do something different.  However, the ending was contrived and out of character for both Stephanie and Joe.  Stephanie really does need to get that job at the button factory, because she is more inept than ever.  All she does is yell for help or run home and hide.  Her perky, endearing qualities are missing in this book.  I agree with the reviewer who thought this series needs a major overhaul.  I was so eager to read this book that I paid a lot for the hardback edition.  I feel cheated.  I could have reread an older book in the series.	2001-11-28

Jessie was about as dumb as any main character I have ever read about.  She carried a 44, was supposedly competent with firearms, never took a shot at a stalker who was shooting at her, and eventually gave her gun up to the stalker while cooking his breakfast.

I gave this book a two star rating because I enjoyed the update on Sherlock and Savich, however, they appeared to have also been struck by the incompent virus.  Looking over some of the reviews, I think many readers bought the book based on satisfaction with past books.  Authors need to protect their reputations.  It is easy to throw a half done effort out to the public and make sales based on past results once or twice, but that won't last forever.  These characters and this plot got dumber by the chapter.

The book lacked a smoothness and continuity that would have made it easier to read.  I think what some readers regarded as suspense was a lack of character development.

This is my first book by the author.  I didn't really get a picture of the characters for a long time.  I asume prior knowledge of the author's books would have been helpful, however, an author of a series needs to include enough background material so a reader doesn't feel as if  he has started reading in the middle of the book. I didn't get an understanding of the relationship between Jury and the main suspect.  I didn't understand how the characters are related.  I've read other series books by different authors and never had the feeling that I was starting in the middle of the book.  I usually am curious and go back and get the previous books.  However, these characters will never make me feel as if I'm visiting old friends.  They are so boring that I will be happy to let them drift off into the sunset never to return. I forced myself to finish the book because I spent the money to purchase a hardback book and had an optimistic tenacity that the book would eventually develop suspense and interest. It didn't.	2000-11-07

I didn't know how many great mystery writers there were, and now there is no going back to something of lesser quality.

I read about this  great love that was so special.  Then the ending. You won't come to America  and live in my house, in my town, with my children, and my parents who  won't like you. Then I don't want us to call, or write, or ever contact  each other again.  So much for that special relationship.  My memory went  back to the section where she'd had short relationships with men that she  kept seeing and sleeping with even though she felt nothing.  I guess this  ten day fling really fits that pattern and wasn't love at all on Miranda's  part.  I liked Li's character far more than Miranda's.  His character  stayed more consistent throughout the book.  I have yet to read a book with  two authors that had a consistent character flow throughout the book.  There are always scenes when the character does something totally different  than what you've been led to expect from the previous material.  I doubt  that I will invest more in a Judith Michaels' book. I felt so cheated after  the last chapter.  Miranda had made friends and professional contacts and  could have had a good life in China.  Li did not have that support if he  had chosen to go to America.  I read a lot, and anyone who thinks life if  perfect in America, and terrible elsewhere is wearing blinders.  There is  good and bad in every political situation where people have any freedom  whatsoever.	2000-09-19

I definitely agree.  I can't think of another book ever with such a totally selfish,  destructive, narcissistic main character as Ronnie. The story opens with  Ronnie covered with red paint and called a name,while her protectors stood  and watched unable to apprehend the woman.  I was sympathetic until the  author developed Ronnie's character more.  Ronnie sold herself to the  highest bidder and then refused to sleep with her husband or wholeheartedly  try to help him win his election.  She did continue to enjoy the lavish  lifestyle provided by the horrible husband.  Then, when Tom was hired to  change her image, she scornfully refused to cooperate.  When Tom refused to  sleep with her, because he had a second chance to turn his reputation  around and become a success professionally, Ronnie kept up the pressure  until she eventually destroyed his business and reputation.  Well if it  dresses like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it must be a  duck(or high-priced prostitute). I also had no sympathy for this poor thing  whose x-rated pictures were published.  Wow, take off your clothes and  seduce a guest at a large party, don't bother to shut the curtains. I'd say  the person wanted to be seen. When Ronnie refused to cooperate with the  lawyer because she couldn't believe anyone could think she killed her  husband, it was truly ridiculous.  Ronnie may have graduated from college,  but she never showed a sigh of intelligence.  I tended to have sympathy  with Tom for part of the book, however, any man who throws away a  girlfriend of several years and a chance to redeem his reputation and  business because he can't keep his pants zipped deserves no sympathy.  Tom  criticized his best friend for a short fling, and turned around and  destroyed the business and their reputation for an affair with a married  woman.  What a self-centered, hypocrite!  Ronnie didn't deserve the  millions from her dead husband, but I guess she will need it to take care  of Tom after destroying his business.  I guess that will make him for sale  as much as she was.  I really think Marla was the only character with moral  value.  At least she knew what she was.  I can't believe I spent the money  to buy a hardback book.  I would have felt cheated if I'd paid a quarter  for the book at a yard sale.  Well, enjoy Karen Robards.  From my feelings  and the reviews of some of the other readers, I think you'll lose money on   future books.  The suspense wasn't there, the romance wasn't there, the  story continuity wasn't there; and steamy sex between characters you don't  like doesn't cut it.	2000-09-19

The pacing was fast and kept my attention at  all times.  I liked the main characters.  I've read so many books lately  with flawed, complex main characters that I've sometimes thought the author  should kill off a few for a better book. I read the book in one day, and  went to the bookstore immediately to find another Jack Higgin's book.  I'm  tired of over long books with minute print by authors in love with their  own rambling dialogue.  I can see a terrific movie from every Jack Higgins  book that I have ever read.
