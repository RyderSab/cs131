Read this story.  You'll forget you're reading.  You see Jake.  You see Cohn with his broken nose. You see Brett in that sweater and your heart breaks. You see Pedro and the bull fight. <br />The problem is the number of people that now make their living giving their opinions about this book.  Don't get caught up with what your high school teacher said,  or deconstructionist professor said, or literary know-it-all, could-have-wrote-it-better said. Don't get caught up with all the journals and theses and textbooks that say it is not as well planned as \\"Across The River And Through the Trees,\\" or a good beginning point for a literary mind, or that real people or real events are incorporated into the plot.  Don't wander around in the \\"lost generation\\" crap or expatriated American garbage, or the impotence and what Freud would say and the myriad of other things that make people spout off Epicurean/Stoic history or analogies to the nth degree.  Don't get sidetracked by the yappers who want to tell you what to think.  If the yappers force themselves on you, merely respond \\"Isn't it nice to think so.\\"  The ones who know better will understand and be embarrassed, the ones who just can't get it will keep on yapping.<br />Just read the story and run with the bulls.	1998-06-24

Even more so, it will chill you when you realize this poem was already old and told around the fires in the meadhalls 700 B.C. <br /> Then when Grendel's mother comes, you find out the essence of horror.  Among these are concepts of wereguild, ring-giving and the honoring of debt before things such as bankruptcy and credit counseling pulled the emotional elements from such problems.<br />Finally, you find the essence of Hero in Beowulf when he goes to his death, and knows he goes to his death, to defeat the Dragon.  He stands almost alone, abandoned by those he protected and led for many years. Yet, instead of saving his life, he marches to what he believes certain oblivion and darkness because he chooses to do the right act. Beowulf is the standard by which all other Heroes are measured.	1998-05-12

Hamlet is the most famous failed law student in Western culture.  Go see a live production. Read the play. Or get a video, or listen to an audio version. Do all four.  Versions of Hamlet have been done by Laurence Olivier, Nicol Williamson, Mel Gibson, Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, or the unattainable version done by Baylor University Theater in the 1950s - the film version won a world film festival in Brussels in 1957. (Yes, I know Jacobi plays the King in Branagh's version, but Jacobi himself played Hamlet - - about the time when Branagh was 15 years old.  It's better than his I, Claudius.) <br />Hamlet, like Shakespeare's other plays, has created a huge cottage industry of scholars, actors, theaters and books.  The force of Hamlet's personality dwarfs all others, however.   To see a man driven mad, and while mad, feign madness, is one of the most clever story twists of world literature.   The mind and heart of Hamlet has been thrown into great, tortured pain by several levers -- the death of his father, the overhasty marriage of his mother to his uncle, the usurpation of his throne by his uncle, the threat to the entire kingdom from Fortinbras, the horrifying appearance of the ghost of his father in purgatory torments, the news of the murder of his father from a supernatural phenomenon. The rejection by his lover, Orphelia, and his ensuing mistrust of her, adds nuclear fission to the fire.  <br />You must experience Hamlet. Oh, for a true friend like Horatio!	1998-04-29

Dr. Ransom, a linguist, (I often wonder if J.R.R. Tolkien was the inspiration for the persona) is kidnapped by a man who he once knew in academic circles, and sent to Mars.  But this is not like other Mars-sci-fi books.  It was published in the middle of World War II in England.  <br />Ransom escapes being a planned human sacrifice on Mars and falls in with creatures that have cultures like the Cherokees (a Native American tribe for those of you on the net not from the Americas).  He meets the planet's spiritual guardian, Oyarsa, and among other things learns that earth is referred to as the \\"silent planet,\\" hence the title of the book.<br />Lewis has several things to say about mankind's wish to colonize the galaxy and beyond - - which are all negative, and amazingly contemporary for readers today.<br />Many fault the technology Lewis envisioned as dated,  but I find hints of Lewis' sci-fi ideas in other stories - - such as the most recent First Contact. Dr. Ransom finds the purpose of his life on earth crystallized on Mars.  You may find your purpose here crystallized as well - - but at the least, you will read a highly entertaining, and unusual story.	1998-04-21

And this story is not for the weak minded or those whose spirits shatter at the slightest confrontation.  You, like John Marcher, will have the uncomfortable feeling that something Terrible, &amp; Permanent is going to happen to you from reading this story. And you're right, but you don't know how right.  The fate is something far worse than you think. Don't find yourself in a graveyard weeping over your May.  You've been warned. This story is not dead paper and ink, or electrons over the internet.  It waits for You to Enter The Jungle.  And it is far better for some not to enter this Jungle, and be awakened to the Beast that even now watches you and prepares to leap.	1998-04-17

You'll yearn for a glimpse of Aslan, the Great Lion from over the Sea, or  Reepicheep the Valiant Mouse.  You'll try to get to Narnia through your own wardrobes, pictures, train stations and ponds.  But these set of books are the only doorway.<br />The Chronicles part of the series may confuse you at first, because the books do not move in chronological order.  The reader moves through three books, then begins jumping around in time.  But you'll realize that Narnia Time is Different.  Whole lifetimes pass during one moment of our world's time.<br /> Do not let the allegorical tags on this masterful opus scare you away.  The story will hold you.  Edward's betrayal of his siblings in The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe; The coming of Age of Prince Caspian in The Silver Chair; sailing to the End of the World in The Dawn Treader with the valiant Reepicheep and the intolerable Eustace; how land is saved by the companionship of a Horse and His Boy; the creation of Narnia and its exposure to evil in The Magician's Nephew; and the valiant last stand of Narnia's loyal subjects against overwhelming evil and darkness with an amazing ending in The Last Battle.<br />These books were first read to me as a small child.  I reread them many times through older childhood, adolescence, university, and now have read them to my own son.  I will read them many more times - - and I look forward to those times.  These books are full of light.	1998-04-02

Lancelot, who is a pretty boy in most film and recent novelizations, is a ugly hulking brute who tries his best (it reminds one of the recent creation of Quoyle in The Shipping News).  And you may be surprised to find that White invented the part of the Merlin legend that Merlin lives backward in time.<br />Yet some parts of the story you may think White invented - such as Lancelot's discovery of what Grace is - - was created by Mallory.  (\\"And ever Sir Lancelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten.\\")  Many critics, of course, squawk that Mallory merely recopied the French tales.  That is too simplistic.  The French were interested in who slept with who. Mallory's original contribution defines what our idea of nobility is - - transcending your circumstances and self,  White takes Mallory carries the torch to our generation.   Again, this is a great place to dive into the Arthur Myth - - it will whet your appetite for Arthurian stories, investigations and research like an addict in search of his next hit or a fanatic in search of miracles.	1998-03-27

Forget what your high school teacher or college professor told you. Forget all the terribly bad film representations of this book.

You'll find that your impressions of David from the brief snippets by critics, teachers, reviewers, professors and know-it-alls completely different than the Real Thing.	1998-03-24
