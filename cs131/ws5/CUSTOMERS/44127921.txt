An excellent ficitional account, from the perspective of Hannah Greene, an adolescent girl, blessed with &quot;the sight&quot;.  She is a practicing Christian, but at heart a Jew, hiding her religion for fear of reprisal and punishement.  Hannah becomes The Queen's Fool, and lives her life at Court, witnessing history as it happens.<br />I was not familiar with all of the history of the period, Queen Mary, Elizabeth, Robert Dudley, etc. but it was riveting. I could not put this book down and spent 3 late nights reading (well worth it!!)<br />Gregory  brings this time period to life, with wonderful descriptions, dialogue and a great story.  I highly recommend this book.  Lose yourself in the past...time well spent.	2004-05-01

Melissa has had her share of ups and downs, and she shares them with her audience.  I liked reading about her songs, why she wrote them, what they mean to her, and having the lyrics included in the book.<br />Melissa is very open about her past, her affairs, and the end of her 12 year relationship with Julie (the love of her life).  Melissa shares her life lessons in this memoir and I would recommend this book to others.  I rate this book 4 out of 5 stars.	2004-03-15
US	44127921	R1EXTAV8Q8CK5L	0802139256	996091853	Peace Like a River	Books	4	3	5	N	N	A spiritual read	Reuben Land, an 11 year old asthmatic is our storyteller. He relates how his life changed after his brother, Davy gunned down two hooligans in cold blood.  Rube's sister, Swede is a writer and throughout the novel we are treated to her writings of westerns and outlaws, which is a parallel to the fact that her brother Davy escaped the law, and is on the lam.<br />The spiritual side of this story lies with Rebuen's Dad, Jerimiah Land.  Small miracles occur when Mr. Land is around; and we the reader, can witness his faith, and his link to God.  <br />I don't want to give away any plot or ending, but the further I read into this story, the more I liked it.  It brought me comfort and aroused my own faith.  Overall, I give this book 4 stars.	2004-03-12

Rape, divorce, death, mental illness. And even though it was a bit depressing, I liked the book. I don't know if I was marvelling at Dolores' resilence, or just amazed that she survived so many sad events.  (Maybe I was happy to read about someone who suffered so much and looked at my life and realized, &quot;Wow...my life could be a lot worse&quot;.)<br />Wally Lamb creates complex characters and certainly moved the story along at a decent pace. (This is my first Lamb read).<br />I read into the wee hours to see how Dolores would handle the adversity thrown her way, so I have to give this book 4 stars out of 5.  It was a well-written story, that kept me interested to the end.	2004-02-22

Clare, who is 40, is dealing with old grief, her age, and a teen daughter having sex.  Normal everyday occurences, but her own emotions and unrecognized feelings are creating uncertainty in herself and in her life.<br />I picked this book up a few times, would read a few chapters and then set it aside.  I finally finished it, and I did like the book, but it was slow going at times.  Overal a 3 out of 5 rating	2004-02-21

Since I am a fan of James Patterson, I wanted to give this one a try. It is a bit cheesy, but if you are a romance fan, than I suspect it will be just what you are looking for.<br />The story was sad, and I don't want to give the plot away in this review. Suffice it to say, there was foreshadowing of what would come; so there really were no shocks in this story. It was well written, and I would recommend this story to the die hard romance fan. I will be inclined to read Patterson's other novels, rather than a romance should he chose to write another.	2004-02-19
US	44127921	R19UQCMIXDYNEV	044661162X	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	4	1	1	N	N	My first Connelly Novel	As the heading suggests, this is my first Connelly read. I enjoyed the story.  It was well written, and not too predictable.  This type of book is what I would call 'lazy' reading. It is not an emotional up and down book, and it is not shocking or that thought provoking.<br />\\"Chasing the Dime\\" is an easy weekend read, to curl up in and just enjoy. Pierce, our main character, has some personal issues that motivate him to make bad choices, that bring him into the forefront as a suspect in a murder case. His obsession to find \\"Lilly\\" the escort who seems to have disappeared, is neither rational or intelligent, and is the means to drag him deeper and deeper into an uknown plot.  <br />Connelly gets a bit technical at times, since Pierce is chemist, and that is a bit hard on the head, but it is kept to a minimum; just enough detail to propell the story forward.<br />Overall, I give this book 4 stars for entertainment value and ease of reading.  I will certainly pick up other Connelly novels in the future.	2004-02-16

The chapters are short, the topics make sense.  A very positive enlightening way to improve your outlook and spiritual self.<br />The best part of the book was the Letting Go list, the wish list and the appreciation list.  Write it down, and it puts everything into perspective. Sounds so simple, and it is.  Such a nice and easy way to look at your life.<br />A five star read for your spiritual health.	2003-10-03

What I like about Loretta is that what you see is what you get.  She is honest and open and has had her share of heartache.  I suspect that is why people can relate to her and her music.<br />I loved Loretta's stories about George Jones, Conway Twitty, and Patsy Cline.  <br />The book is written as Loretta would speak it.  (She talks about how her family could have used 'thurpy')  It makes it easy to picture Lorette speaking the words of her story directly to you.  I give this book 5 stars.	2003-09-16

I am a child of the 80's so the pop culture of that time was a real walk down memory lane for me.  Friendship pins, Jack Wagner, fun dips, etc.  Eliza is searching for something and it really isn't the perfect rock star. There is more substance to Eliza than meets the eye, and I thought that was revealed step-by-step in this story. A very relaxing read that will pass those sunny beach hours easily.	2003-07-01

The premise of the story is three women who met at 19 at the DMV get together as they turn 40 to look back at their lives.  It takes a supernatural turn when an opportunity arises for these ladies to go back in time to live three weeks over again. All three women chose a time important to them, a turning point in their mind, where their lives could have gone one way or another.<br />I enjoyed this read. It was not a deep enduring story, but it was unique and a fun way to pass the time.  Sometimes Devereaux's story is a bit too perfect, but it is a romance after all.<br />Overall, a good story to take you away. Although, it may make you look at your life and decide where in time you would like to return to and daydream about the road not taken.	2003-05-16

I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc.  I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.<br />I have recently read \\"What Dreams May Come\\" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story.  (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).<br />There were still a few times while reading \\"Book of Dreams\\" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, \\"Wow, is she for real??\\"  But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense.  Since her theories are hard to prove, our faith and beliefs are what spirituality is all about.  I enjoy Browne and her books, and I rate this read a 4 out of 5 stars.	2003-02-09

I bought this book for my 7 year old daughter so we could get some easy doll projects that we can make together. I am horrible at sewing and I am not \\"crafty\\" so this book is just my speed. It is written in simple language and has pictures to follow each step of the pattern easily.<br />My daughter and I are going to make \\"Little Guy\\" first. He only takes an hour to do and it is so simple using a pair of stretchy one-size-fits-all gloves, thread, glue and hair for its head. So simple. I can't wait to get started. It lists all the necesary items and optional choices to personalize your doll.  <br />Patterns range from easy to more detailed sewing with a machine, but are simple enough for a child (around 8 and up) to do supervised by an adult.<br />A great craft book worthy of 5 stars.	2003-02-07

Ruth raised 12 kids on love, faith and pure will.  <br />I liked McBride's style, weaving his mother's words into his story.  It was easy to read and touched my heart.  McBride has given a lovely gift to his mother, and his family by telling her story and how it shaped his life.<br />I think the words that touched me the most in this book were from the writings of McBride's father, Dennis.  He quoted a sermon that his father had written and said \\"Sometimes we think if we could just go back in time we would be happy. But anyone who attempts to reenter the past is sure to be disappointed...he finds he is no longer here even in spirit. He has gone on to a new and different life...\\"  I am glad that McBride added his father's words to this story. By quoting his father, McBride makes the point that by researching his mother's past, and searching for himself at the same time, has made him who he is today...but the past cannot be reclaimed and you can not return there; the past can only define you. Very poignant and touching.<br />I recommend this book and give it a 4 out of 5 stars.	2003-01-29

I devoured this book in a day. Easy to read, and a wonderful love story.  The bibiliography at the back of the book is extensive, which shows Matheson did a huge amount of research on the topic of Summerland, and life after death.<br />I've done other more recent reading of the afterlife, and its plausibility becomes more of a fact in my mind.  The love story between Chris and Ann makes one long for love of that kind, on earth and in Heaven.  A wonderfully uplifting read, though the end did not go exactly as I would have liked.  <br />I recommend this book to those interested in learning what may be waiting for us when we die...and in Matheson's words...it sounds wonderful.  I give this book 4 stars.	2003-01-25

And it is a story full of pain, healing, rage and sadness.  I admire her courage in sharing her tale.<br />Sebold is eleoquent, and shares the raw details in a way that disturbs, but does not alienate the reader.  I give this book a 4 stars out of 5, as I was truly entranced by her story.  <br />&quot;Lucky&quot; allows the reader to look into Sebold, and also better explains her characterizations in &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;. (although not a necessity to read it first).  I can see Susie Salmon in Sebold, or is Sebold really Susie??  <br />A brave portrayal of a personal and tragic event in Sebold's life.  I admire her for sharing this book with the world.	2003-01-25

I give it 3.5 stars only because the story took me in such a different direction that it was almost disappointing.<br />I did enjoy the story and as usual, Fielding has very good characters, and she builds them right from the opening line.  Is Terry imagining that she is being targeted for mistreatment?  Or is there a real threat to her life?<br />Her friend, Alison...is she too good to be true?  Fielding has a great talent for storytelling, and this one is no exception.  It was a good read, but perhaps a bit contrived.  Yet, that is what makes the story surprising. (I don't want to give it away....no spoilers here!)<br />If you are a Fielding fan, than this one is for you.  I would recommend this book to other readers.	2003-01-20

It covers Billy's quest to find his mother.  The plot was very contrived and just didn't ring true to me for some reason.  <br />Billy ends up in Santa Fe to look for the mother who abandoned him. He meets Consuelo, a singer and they fall in love.  Billy locates his mother, but the woman he has created in his mind, can she meet his expectations?? I thought the love story was a bit simple, as was the ending.<br />Kowalski would have had to do a smash up job with a sequel to top \\"Eddie's Bastard\\".   He did not succeed, but I will likely read more of his work in the future, since sequels are usually a letdown in most cases.  I didn't hate the book, or the plot, but it left me empty, therefore I give this book 2/5 stars.	2003-01-11

It was fast paced, and it was a mature romance of the Senior Set, (as Julie and Romeo are in their sixties).  The romance was real, it was not &quot;sweet&quot; and syrupy; in my opinion it had some believablility.<br />The two families, the Roseman's and the Cacciamanis' have been feuding for so long, that it is just became natural for all members of both families to hate each other. Except for Julie and Romeo.  The events that transpire are a bit on the ridiculous side, but I found myself laughing and enjoying it all the same.<br />Jeanne Ray makes these characters real, and likable, and that is what I enjoy most about her writing.  I give this book 4/5 stars.	2003-01-11

I found the language set in Victorian era a bit hard to get used to at first.  The changing narrative also threw me a bit, but once I was familiar with Water's style it became easy to read.<br />Margaret becomes a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison to befriend those women who toil and suffer their isolation behind bars.  Selina, a spiritulaist medium becomes the object of Margaret's visits. Their relationship grows and is the intricate point of this story. The story contains hints of ghosts, theivery, secrets and forbidden love. The ending was a twist and in my opinion, very real.<br />I give this novel at 3.5 out of 5 stars, as it was an interesting read, but not my usual taste in novels. Water's does build her characters and make them real to the reader.  I would recommend this novel to others.	2003-01-06

This is the most dysfunctional family I've read about (right up there with &quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot;).  There is homosexuality, promiscuity, lies, secrets, and the silent Joan, who is the youngest daughter, thought to be brain damaged but extremely intelligent, and aware of her families betrayals in her own way.<br />I am still trying to decide if I liked this book.  The characters were interesting and they did draw my interest. But the story is way out there...certainly not a mainstream read.  Gowdy's style confused me a bit at first by changing timelines often, and once that settled down I could follow the plot much easier.<br />An interesting and somewhat shocking read...not sure that I would recommend it to others.	2002-12-31

I wanted to rush in and bring her to my home.  This book brings to light the humiliations of our Seniors and I really wanted this story to enlighten me.  It actually made me very sad.<br />It was a very easy and fast read (only about 130 pages long) and it was so nice to get to know &quot;Miss Spencer&quot;.  This book should remind us that our aged are intelligent, and have feelings, and deserve to be treated with respect.  I am thankful for that aspect of the novel.  I give it a 3, only because I found I was so saddened by the suject.  Perhaps I should score it higher, as a testament to Sarton's wonderful writing and believability.	2002-12-31

A baby is left on Thomas Mann's doorstep in a basket with only a note saying \\"Eddie's Bastard\\".  Thomas is overjoyed to have another Mann to raise, as Eddie died in VietNam.  He named the infant William, after his great great grandfather.  <br />We follow William, or Billy from the time he is a child to his inaguration into manhood at age 18.  Billy's grandfather passes on the Mann family history and rich stories of their ancestors and I found each one interesting and kept me turning the pages.  Their house had ghosts and I actually felt as if I was part of the Mann family while reading this story.<br />There are plenty of ups and downs in Billy's childhood, and through it all, he is postive and learning what it is to be born of the Mann's.  With an unknown mother and a dead father, he comes to accept yet yearn to know more, especially about his mother.<br />It surprises me that this novel has not become a bestseller, because there is bloodshed, ghosts, family secrets, tragedy, sex and lots of family history.  A great story worthy of 5 stars and I look forward to reading Kowalski's sequel to continue following the life of Billy Mann.	2002-12-27

She sometimes gets a bit down about having it, but I explain to her that allergies are usually the cause or trigger (cat dander, dogs and dust mites for her and me!) and we try to take our puffers and medicine to keep us healthy.  <br />This book shows Bravo the horse who used to be out of breath and not able to run fast, doing great and winning the race when he takes care of his asthma.

Grace is left an island that was owned by her parents after they committed suicide.  No one in the family knew about this island, so its existence and the home that was there is somewhat of a mystery.<br />This story is about Grace and her sister's quest to discover why their parents were so troubled, cold and why they lost the will to live.<br />I liked the characters, but there was nothing original or new in this type of story.  It was not compelling, but I did want to know how Grace would deal with her issues so I stuck it out to the end.  Only a three star read.	2002-12-04

The neighbors and their coworkers tend to give the Krank's a hard time about giving up on Christmas.<br />The story takes a turn and it becomes a Seinfeld episode, and I found it quite amusing.

Miranda Tyler is dumped be her fiancee while on holiday in Jasper National Park. Turner leaves Miranda on the top of the mountain, and she tries to convince herself he has just stepped to the washroom.  He does not come back, which leads Miranda on a journey to find herself.<br />Miranda meets Indrin, a kind young man who decides to join Miranda on her camping trip heading to Vancouver.  They meet some interesting folks along the way, thanks to Indrin's future plan to become a priest.  The couple stop at a Catholic church and meet Father Lowry, where Miranda's agnostic opinons collide with the Catholic teachings.<br />Miranda is quite affected by the outlook of her young companion, and Indrin enjoys studying Miranda's sarcasm and quick wit.  Miranda uses these skills to protect herself from grief and sadness.<br />The author's writing style was effective, and I really enjoyed the Canadian references and setting.  The ending was appropriate, and I feel Miranda found what she was looking for on her quest.   A wonderful story, worthy of 5 stars.  I look forward to future writings by Webber.	2002-11-17

This reading changes his life and he follows his own spirit guide, to become the phenomonon he is today.  Many people have found comfort and healing in John's words.  I happen to be a believer, so I have had no doubts in his gift. This book goes into much detail on his readings with clients, and even his own journey to get a message from his deceased Mom.<br />I think my favorite part of the book was John reading for a lady who had a famous relative (and John had no idea who this person was or what he was famous for...not giving this away either...you will have a surprise when you read it!)<br />The book chronicles John's difficulty in becoming famous (even psychic's get 'bamboozeled' from time to time) and he shares a few instances where he was ready to give up.  It proves that mediums can make mistakes just like anyone else.<br />A good insight into this special man, I give the book 4 stars.	2002-11-12

I enjoyed the characters in this story and I look forward to reading more about Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and company.  The action was fluid and I was never sure where Gault, our killer, was going to turn up next.  <br />Cornwell is detailed and this lends credibility to the plot and circumstances.  The events are gruesome, but this is a coroner we are reading about, so that is to be expected.  Cornwell does not exhaust the reader with gore and that made the subject matter easier to handle.<br />The one criticism I do have is that the story moved so fast that I felt I was sometimes missing something. I think I just have to get used to Cornwell's writing style, and I maybe should have started the series in a chronological order. Nonetheless, a satisfying read, and I would recommend the Cornwell series to others, worthy of 4 stars.	2002-11-12

It had all the Blume characteristics, lots of sex, interesting characters, but for some reason, this book did not grab me as others have in the past(like Summer Sisters).<br />Sandy is frustrated in her marriage to Norman, who is very rigid and has sex once a week and never deviates from their \\"routine\\".  Sandy feels there must be more to life and marriage than cooking meals, raising the kids and making Norman happy.  Sandy begins to come alive as she is in several sexual situations with several different men (I won't tell you who...that would give it away!)  <br />Perhaps I have outgrown the Blume story mould and was looking for a more enriching read.  Overall, those who like Blume, will probably like this book.	2002-11-08

Mary Allan tells quite a story about the love of her life, Jim Beamen.  They have somewhat of a whirlwind romance and Mary starts to see that Jim has an addiction to cocaine.  Mary chonicles her spiral downward with Jim as his addiction becomes out of control; coupled with alcoholism and their codependecy.<br />When Jim commits suicide, Mary can't cope with her loss. She begins a descent into mental illness.  Mary becomes 'addicted' to &quot;automatic writing&quot; in which she believes she is corresponding with Jim's spirit.<br />I think Allan is very brave to write this memoir.  I can't imagine her sadness, or her irrational thoughts.  They seem so strange and as I read them, I could feel her overwhelming sadness and desperation to connect with Jim...and it takes courage for her to share that sad desperation with others.<br />I found her writing style effective and I would recommend anyone who has suffered a tragic loss to read this book as it offers an insight into codependency, addiction and grief. Worthy of 4 stars.	2002-11-08

The research the author did must have been tremendous.  Tademy brought these women to life, and of course she had never met them.  What a gift to give her family by honouring them in their past.<br />I live in Canada and slavery is not as large a part of our history as what it has been in the US.  (although it did exist)  In school, we really never learned about this sad part of history and my sources have only been in movies and TV.  This book brought slavery and its tragedy to life.  What it must have been like to have your family sold off and seperated.  I cannot imagine it, yet Tademy documents it and you know it happened and it was real.<br />You will love Elisabeth, Suzette, Philomene and Emily; four generatations of strong women to admire and cry with.  This book was a wonderful read, and worth 5 stars.	2002-11-02

It riveted me and there were parts where I could not help but cry. It is so sad.  Susie Salmon, murdered at 14 looking down from Heaven to see her friends and family cope. (I hope Heaven is just as Susie describes it...for from the eyes of this 14 year old, it is beautiful).<br />Sebold had each member of Susie's family experience this tragic event differently. Her mother ran from her memories, her father lost himself in Susie's little brother, Buck.  Lindsey, her sister was strong and grew up too fast.  Ruth, Susie's friend, saw Susie's spirit leave this world, and became obsessed for years about her.  The characters felt real to me, as if I knew them all from my own neighborhood.<br />I liked Sebold's writing style, and I felt Susie's longing to be on Earth.  I cried for Susie's family and I cried for Susie's death.  I worried when I picked this book up that it would not meet my expectations, but I truly enjoyed this unique story.  This book is in my top three faves of all time. Worth 5 stars.	2002-10-29

This event and her ensuing coma, has the tongues wagging in town.  The characters have a shallow and somewhat pitiful existence.  We get to know Olive's parents, and their sadness as they endure their daughter's coma. We watch as their housekeeper Sophie, experiences spousal abuse at its worst.<br />We meet DeeDee, the town tramp, who is searching for an escape from her unhappy marriage.  DeeDee's daughter Billie, who is not yet 10, is the wisest and most delightful character in the book.<br />West has included Southern recipes to pique our culinary interests which enhances the flavour of this story of living in Louisiana.<br />If you like a soap opera style story, then \\"She Flew the Coop\\" is for you. I give this book 4 stars.	2002-10-29

So many issues, and so many ties from character to character.  Keyes did a great job of building her characters, and I loved everyone of them, even Lorcan (the cad!).<br />Katherine is on a mission to find true love, Fintan is trying to fight for his life, and Tara is trying to find the courage to leave a difficult relationship?  Sounds like a great plot for an NBC soap, right? The dialogue is witty, fun and real.  <br />The ending was great, and I recommend if you like to sip a coffee, get lost in &quot;another world&quot; then this book and these characters are for you.  A five star read.	2002-10-09

I haven't read many books with a male perspective and it was a refreshing change to have \\"The Reader\\" tell the story of our male hero. (Most of the books I read have female characters as the main focus).<br />I thought the story was original, and dealt with difficult subject matter: Hannah seducing our hero when he was only 15, the shame and secrecy of illiteracy, and Hannah being put on trial for her crimes in a Nazi concentration camp.  It is not an uplifting story, but it kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next.  I was a bit perplexed at their relationship, and found myself wondering if the only substance to it was of a sexual nature.<br />I found the ending a bit rushed, and not quite satisfying for that reason.  Overall, this book was a very quick read, and is only worth about 3 stars.	2002-10-09

I loved this book as a child and recently found my copy at my grandmother's house. My daugther, who is 7, loves it too.  Fred and Ted are best friends, and one is big and one is little.<br />The story keeps the child's interest and the drawings are simple, and pleasant.<br />I highly recommend this book for children aged 4-10.

I love corresponding with others, and I looked forward to learning about Hilary and Kate by reading their letters.  I felt that something was missing and I cannot quite put my finger on it.  <br />The book was short and I think what I had been looking for was a longer narrative.  Kate and Hilary's friendship certainly is one of a kind, and it was nice to have a look at their confidences and challenges.<br />Overall, I vote this book 3.5 stars of 5, as the glimpses of Kenya were poignant and interesting, and I did find Kate and Hilary's relationship intriguing.  The story was of real life, so perhaps the only thing wrong was that I have read too much fiction in the past, and this story was reflective of how the world really works.	2002-09-29

Rebecca spends her time thinking about how she got to be a widow, a stepmother, a grandmother and the social spark that rents her home for professional parties.<br />I enjoyed her introspection, and her attempt to return to the past with her high school sweetheart.  She is at 53, wondering how she has become the woman that she is.  <br />Her family, NoNo, Min Foo, Patch, Zeb, and all the players offer variety to Rebecca's life and it is obvious that Rebecca is their steadying force.  The family, in my opinion, did not appreciate Rebecca, and I wondered if she even noticed that at times.  <br />This is the first Tyler book that I have read, and I enjoyed the plot and her characters. Overall, an enjoyable read, worth 4 stars.	2002-09-28

Eleanor sarcastically invites her husband's mistress, a young black girl named Natalie to live with her family.  Natalie is free, expressive and open in a way that Eleanor envies.  Eleanor and Natalie begin to form a close relationship, as does the curious Adam, the young 13 year old son of Eleanor and John.  John is obsessed with possessing Natalie and the story takes a tragic turn.  Eleanor escapes her life, leaving her son behind and does not return to her town until 15 years later.  Adam and Eleanor are strangers, haunted by their past.  I could not really understand Eleanor and Adam during their attempts to reconcile.  <br />When I picked up this book, I expected a compelling story that would captivate me.  I was a bit disappointed, as the writing style was a bit flat and repetitive.  I give the book 3 stars based on the original storyline, but the characters confused me, and I could not really warm to them.	2002-09-22

Dinah's story in the bible is told not in her words.  It only hints at what happened, and Diamant takes Dinah's life and writes it as it may have been.  Dinah's life is truly a &quot;soap opera&quot;, and I was compelled by her strengh to survive the things she experienced.  <br />The women in the red tent shared, cried, laughed, loved and learned from each other.  It was their world away from the men that led them.  Their secrets, knowledge and lives carried on generation to generation from daughter to daughter, and reading about this sisterhood enraptured me.  A story worthy of 5 stars.	2002-09-22

Rosie shares her obsession in helping others, her insecurities, her fears, her codependency, and opened us up to a whole side of herself that we were unaware.<br />It takes great courage to write a book like this, as it really casts her as a troubled woman, with major issues.  I have always liked Rosie (and still do) and it just makes the point that we never know someone truly by their behaviour on the outside.  Here is Rosie, a huge celebrity, successful and funny, yet inside she has fears, and a huge hole with the death of her mother.  <br />A very easy and quick read, and I am amazed that a celebrity would share this subject matter with her fans. But I am certainly glad she did.  A bit dark, yet an honest emotional portrayal of an event that had a huge impact on her life.	2002-09-11

Maggie, at the young age of 10, sees God.  And God is a woman.  Healing powers are bestowed on Maggie, and the burden of her gift at times becomes too much for her to bear or understand.  Maggie's mother and grandmother play a huge part in her life, as does Maggie's first experience with love.  Maggie meets Alex, and during the summer, they spend time on the farm, discussing her gift and trying to understand why she has been chosen to work God's miracles.  <br />The story continues to unfold as her mother suffers a stroke, and Maggie reaches to God to heal her sick loved one.  When this does not happen, Maggie rejects her faith, in herself and in God.  As well, Maggie rejects Alex and he leaves her, swearing to return when she will finally believe in their love.  I kept turning the pages to see if Maggie and Alex can recapture their love...and the ending fits the story.  <br />This story is a soulful journey, with strong female characters, especially Maggie who is our portal to God's love.  A rich tale, worthy of 5 stars.	2002-09-09

This book is made up of their e-mail responses which shares the fear, sadness, laughter, tears, treatment progress and strength that ensues during Lara's battle with cancer.  Susan offers her experiences as insight to Lara, and a wonderful friendship blossoms during this difficult time.  Even as Lara fights for her future health, she offers support to Susan as she suffers a loss in her family, and deals with an adolescent teen.  Overall, this book had excellent details of treatment options, side effects, breast reconstruction, and advice on what to look for in a doctor.  <br />I lost a close co-worker of 5 years to a misdiagnosis of a breast lump.  She had the lumpectomy, was told it was benign and during a 6 month leave from work to focus on her health, her body was unknowingly being ravaged by cancer (with no symptoms).  When she returned to work, she got sick with a cough, and within 3 months died of cancer in her lungs, spine, liver. If only she only had known to get a second opinion on the lumpectomy(as this book offers as advice), she may have been able to fight, but she lost this battle.  I support breast cancer charities in her memory, and I encourage every woman to read this book to be informed of treatment options and how this disease can be conquered with education.  This book was a heartwarming read, worthy of 5 stars.	2002-09-08

Ekaterina shares her life on these pages with the reader, and tells us of the Sergei she knew and loved.  For him to pass on at such a young age, only makes the story more sad and hard to understand.  Ekaterina has written a lovely tribute to her husband, and is a 5 star read for any figure skating fan, or person who wants the insight on a real life love story.	2002-09-07

He was gracious, and gladly autographed my copy of this book.  The figure skating fan will enjoy this book and its coverage of skating through the years.  The new fan will enjoy learning about the figure skating disciplines, jumps and fan favorites, who are still entertaining us today in ice shows.  I have shared this book with people who do not follow figure skating and it was most helpful in giving information on the who's who from skating in the nineties, and how these skaters have influenced today's skating generation.

I recently reread parts of this book because of a tragic loss of a dear friend to suicide.  The chapter that deals with this difficult situation, was of real comfort to me.  Some people may not &quot;believe&quot; but for me, the idea that a person can be in a better place, and is not forever punished for their act leaves me feeling peace.  I do believe in the other side, and that we can be contacted by those who have passed, and George's sessions with clients, who have had their own experience with hearing their loved ones words, is enlightening and offers hope.

She uses wordplay like no other author.  The fact that I had to get out the dictionary a few times, shows that she has a wonderful command of the english language and sharing words with us to make us think.  Unfortunately, the story left me flat.  It was almost a book about \\"nothing\\".  Nothing happened, except that we hear about the Reta's writing and her troubled feelings about her daughter Norah, who is living on the streets of Toronto, for no apparant drug problem, abuse problem or reason.  At least there was a resolution to the plot, hence its 3 stars.  As well, Shields uses language beautifully, but I need a story to keep me interested and entertained.	2002-09-06

Ria was our main character, and her house swap with Marilyn, is a plot device that reveals character secrets to show us some major character flaws in those involved in their lives.  Marilyn was introduced later in the story, and I did not feel as much of a bond to her at the end of the story, but I did feel that I was glad to have known Ria.<br />Ria's world is crumbling as she faces her husband's lies, finanical problems, and betrayal of friends.  Marilyn is facing major sorrow in the loss of a loved one, and her inability to deal with her sadness and the secrets around her loss, make her future unknown.<br />In this story, Binchy demonstrates the dangers of secrets and lies, and how it affects the lives of the main characters as well as the supporting cast.  Ria and Marilyn learn more about each other, having never met, then by seeing one another face-to-face.  Just by meeting their friends and family, Ria and Marilyn piece together the truth in each other's lives, without ever knowing the truth of their own reality.  A well written piece of irony.<br />I recommend Tara Road on its rapid pace, fleshed-out characters and reality of plot.  Worthy of 4 stars.	2002-09-06

I bought this book when I went back to work after having my first child.  It seems that new moms are wrapped up in guilt on going back to work; however in today's society, the reality is that in most partnerships, both mom and dad end up working just to make ends meet.<br />This book will give you a little extra boost to let you know that working will not be detrimental to your child. Love your child and be ensured that your child will benefit, whether you work or not.	2002-08-29

It was a very good source or material, and it listed the milestones for each month your baby grows, what to expect at doctors checkups, and gave a good description of symptoms and what to do for childhood illnesses.<br />It was not quite as good as \\"What to Expect When you are Expecting\\" but overall I did use this book when I needed to know a pertitent bit of info.  I have given my copy to a friend for when she has her first child and I know it will prove useful.  Overall, a helpful guide worth 4/5 stars.	2002-08-29

God's little devotional book gives me that time to reflect and look inward.<br />The artwork is lovely, and has a thoughtful caption to ponder.  On the opposite page, an anecdote that may be about a historical celebrity, biblical times, or a fable.  At the end of each story, a bible verse to draw you to God.  <br />I read a page or two at the end of my day, to bring my life into perspective. This book reminds me that at this hectic pace, not to forget that love, faith and spiritual understanding is what makes me a richer woman.  This book would be a wonderful gift for a special woman in your life.	2002-08-24

My 7 year old enjoys the activities too.  We tend to do the arts and crafts projects because they are easy and fun.<br />Some of the games are so simple, that you can grab your household items to give your kids something new to do very quickly.  The clothespin drop was a hit in my house, as was the pull box.<br />My favorite activity (so far) has been making kool-aid playdoh.  Oh yes, and the kids liked it too.  As well, the paste recipe my grandmother used to make is in this book. The kids had great fun pasting pictures from catalogues onto paper with this goopy stuff(and I joined in too).  This book is an endless array of ideas for your kids.	2002-08-24

This book offers realistic advice on how babies sleep. I did not agree with all of Mindell's theories, but in the end, her advice did work.<br />Babies have to learn to fall asleep on their own.  And in my case, our 3 month old needed a soother, or wanted to be rocked. If the soother fell out, she woke up.  The rocking and the soother were her cues to sleep.<br />I read this book and then my husband and I took the soother away, and stopped rocking Mariah.  It was very difficult to hear my child cry, and at one point, it took an hour of crying for her to fall asleep.  (And I was crying myself).<br />But after 2 days, when I laid Mariah down in her crib, the time it took her to fall asleep got shorter and shorter.  Mariah is now 2 and she goes to bed and still naps, and she can fall asleep on her own.  It was a painful way to do it, but it did work.  Read the book, and decide for yourself if you want a few days of stress, to have a lifetime of good sleep habits.	2002-08-24

I did not think my birthday description was correct, but it did seem accurate for some of my friends. (it is hard to be objective on one's own personality)<br />I first read this book while waiting for an intuitive reading, and decided to buy it.  It is fun to share with friends, and I have used it as an ice breaker for a get-together.  <br />The book gives colors, gems, flowers and fragrances for your birthday.  As well, your lucky numbers, charms, best day of the week. etc.  Judith then gives a description of your personality and it is fun to read about those close to you to see if the description fits.  Entertaining, and detailed.	2002-08-24

This was a well written mystery story.  The plot moved at a brisk pace, and had lots of colorful characters. For example, Quita, our victim, is a young woman surrounded by mystery, in her death and in her life.  <br />I also enjoyed the references to the menus Madeline and Wes were serving at the Mahjong parties; my mouth was watering for Dim Sum several times!<br />I enjoyed Madeline's up and down love life in the story as much as the murder mystery.  It is obvious that Madeline has reached a point in her life where she is looking for more from her relationship, and her public breakup with her boyfriend (over a hamburger) seemed quite fitting.<br />The outcome was not obvious, but once all the loose ends were tied up, it was the only ending to this story.<br />Overall, an enjoyable book, with plenty of action, with very little actual violence.  A palatable and satisfying reading experience, worth 5 stars.	2002-08-23

I have loved Judy Blume's books over the years and this one was no exception.<br />Vix and Caitlin are friends who always spend the summer together. Vix is self-centered and selfish, Caitlin the more giving and sensitive partner in this friendship.<br />The ending was worthy of the story (but I'm not giving it away here) and it is enjoyable to follow this friendship as the girls explore love, sex, betrayal, and friendship loyalty.<br />This is an adult read, not for the younger set, and I think it is a classic example of Judy Blume's skill of great story-telling, coming of age exploration and looking within ourselves.	2002-08-17

So I picked this one up, and it was an amazing read.<br />The story is told by four daughters and the mother in the Price Family.  Their father/husband, is a Baptist minister, who brings the family to the Congo during a tumeltous time in history.<br />The opening offers a foreshadowing of events to come, and when we reach the end, the meaning of it is quite clear.  Africa is alive, and can bring the inhabitants to its mercy.<br />The Price family suffer hardship in the Congo, as missionaries trying to bring Christianity to the small village in which the live. The villagers look upon them with curiousity and wonder, and are not intersted in the regilous message they bring.<br />Kingsolver's words brought the Congo alive for me, that I could almost breathe the air.  This is an enriching story, and I hope to read future books by Kingsolver.	2002-08-17

Kathryn's world comes crashing down when she realizes her husband was not who he said he was.  Karhryn was blinded by the lack of intimacy in her marriage, and passed it off as middle age boredom.  One wonders why we can see it unfolding as Shreve tells the story of this family, and Kathryn was not able to.<br />I enjoyed this book, it was interesting and kept me turning the pages to find out how Kathryn was going to reconcile the truth.<br />I was disappointed with Shreve's &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; and this read was much better.  As well, this book was a TV movie, starring Christine Lahti.  Stuck fairly closely to the plot, but as usual, the book was better.	2002-08-17

A ransom kidnipping, that has different twists and turns. Lots of action. Just when you think you have figured out how it is all going to end, you will be surprised.<br />I picked this book up thinking it would be a run of the mill read, but I was pleasantly surprised...it was fast paced and the plot premise was very original<br />A great read, and a real good page turner.	2002-08-14

Sidda must learn to love herself and her mother, Vivi before she can become happy and fulfilled in her life.  <br />Vivi, in an effort to reach out to her daughter, shares a treasured scrapbook with Sidda in a symbolic gesture of her need to be accepted by her daugther.<br />Sidda's biggest obstacle is her fear of intimacy and this is caused by her lack of confidence in her mother's love and relationship.  And Sidda must learn to love herself before she can devote herself to her partner. Sidda finally does this and opens her heart to her partner, as well as her mother.  <br />Vivi's obstacle is the pain of her own childhood, which was also difficult.  Sidda and Vivi must try to reach forgiveness to overcome their fear and pain.    <br />I enjoyed this book. It was a story of discovery and looking at one' s past and making it a part of the future, by embracing it and then letting it go.  <br />Overall an enriching read, and a good story.	2002-08-14

Since I've read it, I have been doing the self-talk and the affirmations, and it really works. If you surround yourself with postive thoughts, it creates positive energy and that is what this book is about.<br />How many people do you know that seem to attract bad luck or other negative people? It is almost like a vicous circle, bad things happen, you have negative thoughts in your mind, and more bad things happen.  This book will give you the tools to break that circle, use your mind and power of thought to turn things around.<br />We have the power to make our lives a fulfilling and wonderful journey, by just using your mind and thoughts to get there, and if you read this book, you can find your way.	2002-08-14

I knew going in that it was sad and going to be a roller coaster ride.  And it sure is.  <br />There is death, violence, heartbreak, incest.  It is set in my home province of Nova Scotia, and it is irony to set such a dark story in such a beautiful place.  <br />When I read this book, I could not put it down. It was almost like seeing an accident, being afraid to look, but looking anyway.  The characters are interesting, some are disturbing.  But it is an amazing story nonetheless.<br />Not a book for the weak...be prepared and read at your own risk. Ann Marie MacDonald can encapture you, and make you sad and then make you wonder if it enriched you or just shocked you.  Find out for yourself.	2002-08-14

The novel had a lot of history, which I enjoyed learning.  It goes into great detail on many of the appearances and miracles of Mary in history.   <BR> <BR>The narrator does a lot of theorizing and questioning, why does God not protect us from evils (floods, tornadoes, violence etc.?) And in this book, we don't really get the answers, but some of the narrators thoughts are thoughts that I myself have had or depict simple scenes that at one time or another, I am sure people have \\"prayed\\" for. In one chapter, there is a scene where the narrator buys a lotto ticket, and Mary says to her that she would not be able to help her out in that area, but \\"there are angels who take care of that\\". And then the narrator talks about angels she has read about, Angels of fruit, angels of aspirations, etc.  The narrator tells the reader that \\"she has yet to find an angel of lotteries\\".  So there is some wit in the book that I took pleasure in.  <BR> <BR>I would classify this book as a literary read, intelligent, and fulfiling. I enjoyed reading about Mary's many miracles and the narrator's questions of faith, irony, prayers and history.  I think that what I missed from this book was that the narrator did not ask Mary any deep questions.  But I am sure that if Mary were in my house, I would probably not ask them either! For example, the narrator did not ask Mary this question: why does God permit evil on the Earth? If he were all good, then why do we suffer injustices and misery?  Mostly what the narrator gets from Mary are detailed stories about her miracles and visitations/appearances throughout the ages. So, I was looking for a natural curiousity from the narrator to ask the obvious questions of Mary that we all would want to ask.  Still, an interesting story, worth a 4/5.	2002-08-07

As a child of the seventies, I know not of the turbulent times that so many lived through during the War.  To hear in Hanna's  own words the pain of discrimination, and being labelled as subhuman, and to hear the sadness, fear and longing for her true love Hans (who she can no longer associate with as he is a Christian, she a Jewish descendant)...to hear these things in her own words from that time, transported me to that time in history.  I almost felt as if I was there, sharing in her pain and not knowing the uncertain future...even though I knew what history had brought, and I was indeed using my will and hope for it not to happen (even though I knew War would be there, as well as the persecution of so many innocent people).  I wished I could erase history...but from reading this story, I hope many people will learn from it.  I learned that strength and faith, can see us through many hard times.<br />This book was an amazing journey and I feel richer for hearing Hanna's words.	2002-08-05
