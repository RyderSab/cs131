This one was 472 pages and I devoured in about five hours. I got it from the library, to be honest. I wish I'd bought it, so I could lend it, but who would I lend it to, considering what it's about? It's something of a historical novel, set in the late 1800's, about a girl born to a oystering family in Britain. Are you yawning? Don't. She becomes involved in the stage. Boring? Not just any stage... but masher shows. Masher means girls-dressed-as-gents, pretending gallantry, singing saucy numbers full of innuendo, swinging canes. Our heroine falls for one of these \\"masher\\" girls and in doing so slowly, and without any education or vocabulary, unearths her own lesbianism. The plot is just fantastically interesting, and erotic in places, and completely full of 1890's jargon, sights, and sounds. The sexual nature of the book's theme is both understated, almost accidental, and completely central. Women dressed as men, women passing as men... I've never seen a treatment so lavish and so practical. I'm already browsing Amazon looking for used copies of her other books. This one was the author's first novel and is highly acclaimed. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her work. Sarah Waters! I've never heard of her before! I picked the book because of its interesting cover and the fact it was highly reviewed by The New York Times Book Review; I didn't even know what it was about. I love not knowing what a book is about, when I start to read it. I love trying to figure out where the author is going. I love not being able to guess or unpuzzle it too quickly. I avoid reading the inside covers, I don't read the summaries, or the back covers, sometimes I don't even read the content of the review - only check good/bad and the review's origin - I don't want to spoil it by knowing anything else. This book rewarded me. (P.S. I just found out that in Britain the book was so popular they made the whole thing into a BBC television mini-series! It's ordered on NetFlix already. I WANT IT. It's funny how something can exist for so long, and be so popular, and there's always the day you hear about it for the first time.)o a BBC television mini-series! It's ordered on NetFlix already.

It's tiresome, repetitive, has a dreamy quality to it that makes the whole thing feel undefined. Sure, our heroine has a few cute quips and has a whimsical resourcefulness.

Some short, some long, these essays are everything from quick and wandering dialogues to beautifully crafted essays. They're not necessarily *about* anything in particular. The only thing they have in common is that the authors, many of whom will be known to you, use a fairy tale as a sounding board for their miscellaneous ideas... on girlhood, feminism, and storytelling. They are of wide variety (some are less ambitious than others), all engaging. The only downside is that it's a quick read -- more like reading magazine articles than an absorbing non-fiction book.	2004-01-23

Despite a few clumsy transitions from description to action here and there, and despite an awkward timesharing between super-magical and super-real, this book is excellent. The characters are vivid, real enough to touch. The historical magic is handled intelligently and with a sense of high drama (if even well-done melodrama turns you off, beware). The book has style and strength. The prose is evocative, richly texturely, deeply involving. The topics range from practical love and human conflict to cultural issues spanning time and country. There's enough romance - of people, of place - to fill your head until you're breathless. I highly recommend it. Highly.	2004-01-23

As a treatise meant to persuade the reader, its reasoning and language is nothing short of ridiculous. He fails to establish any sort of common ground or reliability. Then he wallows in abusive Ad Hominum, discrediting pro-technology positions by insulting those who hold it. He introduces a dozen red herrings, wasting time justifying conclusions irrelevant to the issues at hand. The book erects an army of straw men as it attempts to justify its rejection of positions by creating then discrediting different and usually weaker positions. More than anything it is a gallery of appeals to emotion, attempting to rationalize its conclusions by appealing to the sentiment of the audience. (There is enough thickly sweet sentiment in every chapter to make Cicero proud.) I could go on, but I'm already leaving this review barren of specific examples in order to deliver as much warning as I can in as few words: this book is nothing more than an irrational emotional outburst against computers and the Internet. It contains no compelling argument, and will drown you in sentimental prose as eye-rolling as any grocery store romance novel. Do not expect Stoll to be your rational, level-headed guide to the dangers of technology. Do not expect thoughtfully compiled evidence, articulate and clever argument, and a reasonable conclusion. Should he have had anything to say, he abandoned it from the first sentence of his project to a weak, wandering essay on &quot;feelings&quot; alone.	2004-01-23

The writing style is like a piece of modern art: sometimes abstract and filled with strange brevity. The issues of the story are raw, emotional, and distinctly adult: feminism, dominance and submission, sex, power.<br />'Black Wine' is not a \\"fun\\" escapist storybook -- it is a highly stylized and challenging piece of literature that invites you to read closely and see deeply.

It's supposed to be a deadly serious book. None of the reviewers, neither professional nor readers like myself, describe the book as a parody. (Or even acknowledge the parody.)

I spoke to the author via email shortly after I finished this book. I asked him for an autographed copy. Rather than permitting me to send him a copy of the book to sign, he chose a hardcover edition from his collection, signed it to me personally with a beautiful lyric of original poetry involving life and peaches, and sent it to me the following week. I was cradling the book as if it were made of the purest gold. I felt exactly as if I knew Mr. West, that I had been with him through his ordeals. That I had his handwriting - both inside the book and on an inserted card! - was very moving.<br />This is an important book. An educational book. And, at heart, it's a gutsy book. This man has poured himself nakedly into the pages of this autobiographical volume, and you will bear silent witness to his challenges, his mistakes, his success. Other books on this topic (and I've read almost all of them) did not hit so hard for me. They were &quot;titillating,&quot; perhaps. I felt as if I might be neck-craning as if at an accident.

This is one of those cases where readers have none of the facts, independently, and writers are being selective--not to say deceptive--to make emotionally charged points. Who to believe?<br /><br />Operating without the facts, this much seems sure: that human nature being what it is, it is unlikely that the holocaust story is not being exploited by some and manipulated by others.  Those who would maximize or absolutize the holocaust have interests.  Those who would minimize or relativize the holocaust have interests. A lot depends on where you are making your case, and why. The question is what to make of human nature in the face of history.  I would say that the factual enormity of the Jewish holocaust is not going to go away, nor its uniqueness, no matter how many other illustrations can be found of man's inhumanity to man, each just as unique and horrible in its own way. Genocides do not eclipse one another; they stand side by side stretching from the beginning of tribal life to the indefinite future. We just need to reduce the number of situations in which descendants or survivors (of holocausts) are made to compete (i.e. more for me means less for you) for some scarce resource on the basis of the relative magnitude of their suffering per capita.  God has no shortage of consolations to offer.  Nor should we.<br /><br />It seems that the only way to judge post-holocaust literature is by its likely ethical consequences: in other words, prefer accounts that will make holocausts less likely in the future. On that score, the Finkelstein book, judging by its title and aim, might not be a good thing, as on-target as some of its accusations might be.  However, best would be for you to read it, and come to your own conclusions.  Then you can write the author and let him know what you think.	2004-01-05

From evidence in the author's introduction, I do wonder if this book was more difficult to produce than his others. I guess it does lack the liquid flow of imagery and energy that some of his other pieces have; but, to be fair, he is puppeteering an immense cast in this work, and some of the clumsiness almost goes hand-in-hand with that effort. Still, it was a page-turner, and had both Barker's shuddering horrors and his dry humour in spades.<br />The book's format is really interesting. A climax comes early, and then Barker follows the characters well into the aftermath. The climax is so savage it's almost as if he's holding you afterwards, comforting you, soothing you; certainly the characters soothe each other. A reference to human sexuality? Well, maybe. The book does has its fair share of explicit sex. And if you don't know anything about the artist Hieronymus Bosch, you will at the end of this volume.<br />I definitely recommend this book.	2003-11-12

It worked. As a plausible case for the identification of Jack the Ripper, it's lacking. Of course it is. It's a crime novel. It has to return to the excitement and gut-wrenching details; it can't -- it's not allowed to, in this genre! -- linger too long on the science or the law or the history. It already &quot;errs&quot; in that direction too much to be an effective crime novel. And unfortunately too little to be an effective legal or forensic assessment of the Ripper or of Sickert. I think the author, editors, and publishers -- and all the other media folks who jumped on this bandwagon -- played their game very well.

Easy, accessible, and glossy glossy glossy. It also wanders something fierce, let me tell you. The author seems to have a point... but there's no tight focus, no direction. One of the New York Times reviewers said the book was like a &quot;county fair&quot; -- and I'm not sure that's a compliment! However, if you can be patient with the wandering, the lack of focus, and the gloss... wow! Great information, humorously presented, packed with bizarre trivia and some pretty new-to-me ideas.

I borrow the word \\"flawed\\" from another one of the reviewers. She's right. It is flawed. This book is at once incredible and frustrating. It makes some important points, it's written from a well-educated and well-informed perspective, but it \\"feels\\" less rigorous than would satisfy me... not because it isn't, but because the author's style is very conversational, even at times like stream-of-consciousness writing, wandering from point to point without following a clearly defined path.<br />I appreciate that the author's personality is so \\"present\\" in the text. But,  at the same time, the conversation she's having with her reader could do with more focus. I was both happy to go along with her wandering style, and also constantly wishing she'd stop and tell me more about her points (support them) and return to them to help conclude her delivery with strength.<br />Nevertheless, this book was, for me, an excellent introduction to the psychology of violence and the \\"big secret\\" kept about killers on Death Row: that they're mildly to severely neurologically impaired.

But this one didn't appeal to me. The opening line was funny enough for me to think I was going to have a good time, but the pace was quickly mired by the stylizations of the author, who introduces (without much call) ponderous literary and historical references, and quotes from the most erudite thinkers and writers, almost as if to prove that he is, or his character is -- what, older? educated?<br />Frankly, if it was meant to help a characterization along, then it wasn't done gracefully. I felt more like the author had a copy of &quot;Bartlett's Familiar Quotations&quot; by his side, and less like this style contributed to the humour, plot, or characterizations. At least the passages where the characters interacted (dialogue) were worth skipping forward to read.  But I found the writing to be so pre-occupied with its &quot;look how well-read I am&quot; feel that I lost interest in the book entirely and ended up putting it down.<br />I don't recommend this book for any but the most committed reader.

I was disappointed. More than anything, this book wants to be a mainstream action/thriller movie. It reads like a script turned into a manuscript. Its dialogue, plot points, and characterizations are each so carefully introduced and easy to grasp that the whole thing had a &quot;made for television&quot; feel. As a book, I found it clumsy at best. Awkward. Was the author afraid of being too &quot;bright&quot; for his audience? Was he afraid that with such a large cast of characters we needed extraordinary hand-holding to &quot;get&quot; him? I don't know. But I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who's looking for something polished or challenging. Maybe it will be a movie one day. I'd definitely see it matinee.	2002-01-13

I didn't meet Clive Barker as an author of the &quot;horror&quot; genre. I read Imajica first, and then The Great and Secret Show, and Everville. None of these were &quot;horror&quot; books the way I have ever considered the genre, although I've seen some people call these books &quot;gorefests&quot; (which I don't quite get - I thought horror was gratuitous violence, not meaningful blood). My point is that I was not disappointed that this book fell short of &quot;horror&quot; (as so many people have mentioned). I wasn't expecting horror, I was expecting magical realism, epic-style. And I got just that.<br />This book reminds me a little of 'The Prince of Tides' (don't laugh - I'm serious!). It's epic length, follows a family closely, looks inside of them and then *features* their dysfunction. That's what fascinates the reader. And in this book, magic, not just politics, saturates the family history.<br />Don't go into this book expecting gross/horror/sex/blood. It's not that kind of book. It's a detailed novel of magical realism with a long, stylized, constructed plot. And Clive Barker has something to say while he entertains you. His message, which I won't give away, is probably the most frightening part of the book.	2000-10-21

The interview with Leonard Cohen alone is by far worth every penny I chose to spend on this book. I love Leonard Cohen... to see these two artists interacting and conflicting in a dialogue on a printed page was FANTASTIC. The rest of the book is a little harder to warm up to... although die-hard fans will cherish every window into Suzanne's head and heart.	2000-10-18

Just wanted to mention that the ending is... well... After all the magic realism, she abandons the realism part... and delves into the completely abstract. I was enjoying myself fancying that the story was &quot;real&quot; and not just a metaphor for her essentially essay-like study of exile (author is a scholar of exile).... but, near the end, she makes it clear it's a metaphor. Darn. I was enjoying the illusion. Still, a really powerful and highly engaging read. You're not going to waste your money here, I promise.	2000-10-18

This book reminded me, in mood and character, of Tad William's &quot;Tailchaser's Song&quot; and of Richard Adam's &quot;Watership Down&quot; -- no, nothing to do with animals, but to do with  otherworldiness. 'Imajica' is populated with a variety of interesting  people, all of whom are lovingly rendered with a level of detail and  attention to history that makes them uniquely motivated and easy to relate  to... and they move through episodes, evolutions, and worlds in ways which  are vivid, captivating, suspenseful, and satisfying. I believe near the end  the book loses some degree of focus and some of the characters I felt I  knew intimately started behaving in ways I didn't find believable, and  there was the unfortunate 'and then they  disappeared' type ending... but,  ending aside, the journey was fabulous. I couldn't put the  book down. I  read it voraciously. I highly suggest it, if you're in the mood for  involving, highly detailed fantasy and world-building.	2000-07-04

Or maybe I just wasn't up to the task. I adore Atwood's work, largely speaking. I love the play on gender issues, the windows onto the  character's personal worlds, the suspense and tension Atwood can introduce  and tease into page-turners... But this book? Maybe it's because it spent  so much time developing a &quot;politics&quot; sub-plot, or because it took  place on an island that was difficult for me to render inside my head...  but I just never understood what was going on. Never exactly understood,  never could get &quot;connected&quot; enough with anything to care. That's  so weird, since I get completely wrapped up in her other stories and  novels, and I've read them all. I don't want to give this book a thumbs  down, for fear that it's my own lack of skill *as a reader* that made the  book so opaque and boring... but at least this review might give you some  information pertaining to the apparent difference in this work from  Atwood's others, you know?	2000-07-04

While slow in parts, the story is strong, the characters are  engaging, the examination of social problems interesting and robust, the  rollercoaster ride exhilerating. I highly recommend this book, and all of  Tepper's works, to readers who enjoy storytelling with real meat to it.	2000-02-08

These books are extraordinary for building a child's ego and self-confidence. The books are structured so that the child's imagination and the child's opinions about life are in the spotlight.  The  anti-coloring books make kids feel good! They are books that actually  manage to give kids the attention they need - rather than demanding  attention from the kid. The anti-coloring books continually ask questions  about the child, her thoughts, her feelings, her visions. They are  brilliant mechanisms for encouraging confidence and creativity. From a  parent's perspective, the finished books become a window onto the emotional  and psychological landscape of your children. What do they really think?  What makes them angry? What are they wishing for? I highly recommend any of  the anti-coloring books for children of all ages. Mom and Dad should try  them too!	1999-10-18

I was laughing happily at the ridiculous prose (crafted to imitate Poe's writing style) and the clever, over-the-top parodies of both Crockett's and Poe's  characters.  But as I read on, I realized that the novel possibly wasn't  intended to be funny. Did I misunderstand? I came to Amazon.Com to find  out. Well. Here I found it. It's supposed to be a deadly serious book. None  of the reviewers, neither professional nor readers like myself, describe  the book as a parody. (Or even acknowledge the parody.) As I read on, I  found myself less and less willing to put up with the author's style.  Unable to trust it as humor, it's simply a tedious book. I didn't finish  it.	1999-04-25

It's so well-conceived, the characters are accessible and interesting, the story was multi-facetted and solemn. I'm not sure Amazon.Com will know to recommend this to you, but if you love  in-depth stories with characters you come to know, in political and social  situations that are captivating and real-seeming, you should not only read  &quot;The Awakeners&quot; but you should also consider Richard Adams  lesser-known book &quot;Maia&quot; for a similarly involving, detailed  story.

Someone mentioned that &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; would be the best of both worlds: a long, detailed story with an amazing scope and amazing characters, and a feminist  theme to carry it along. Just so you know, I read it ignorant of all the  hype. I was skeptical of the &quot;3 Months on the New York Times Best  Seller List!&quot; sticker on the front. Round about chapter 18 I was  joking with my husband that it stayed on the list that long only because  that's how long it takes to READ the blasted thing. Needless to say, I  wandered to a stop before I reached chapter 20. I never even made it  halfway.<br />Writing: Dull, lifeless, unevocative, boring.<br />Characters:  Unpredictable, poorly motivated.<br />Story: Nothing good to say. (I don't  know the original Arthurian legend from a Beatrix Potter tale. Maybe that  would have helped me.)<br />Feminist theme: Excellent in terms of spotlighting  how the men treat the women and what men's expectations of women are. Poor  for the trite depiction of the priestesses and the constant ridiculously  over-dramatic references to the Goddess. (Elizabeth Hand plays a better  song with &quot;Waking the Moon&quot; -- go try that one.)<br />Religious  Theme: Christians = bad. Got it.<br />Despite the fact this book was a waste  of my time, it obviously wasn't a waste of time for a thousand others.  (Check out the reviews here. Can you believe it?) So I'll moderate my  thumbs-down with an acknowledgement that this book has impressed and  entertained many people, and that counts for something. (Right?)	1999-04-16

Like other Tepper books I've read, this one is excellent for provocative thoughts and insights, but only fair in terms of characterization and storytelling.<br />This book, for example, involves a group of original and  well-detailed characters, but they are typically dealt with in obvious  series or sequence. i.e. First her life, then hers, then hers, now hers,  and finally hers. This may be a stylistic choice, but it can feel forced.<br />While Tepper's style does not seem to emphasize lush description or  detailed scene-setting, sharing ideas is always central and handled well.  In fact, during &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; I could not help thinking that  Tepper wanted to write a book of non-fiction -- thoughts on male supremacy,  feminist history, multiculturalism, anthropology -- but couched it in a  millennial storybook for reasons unknown.<br />The best thing about Tepper is  that you can LEARN from her books. You come away from them with ideas and  new perspectives. Despite the fact that her books aren't going to provide a  &quot;wild ride&quot; (i.e. for those who prefer David Eddings, Stephen  Donaldson, Robert Jordan), they are going to be entertaining and  thought-provoking.<br />Most importantly... In the middle of &quot;Decline  and Fall&quot; I had that familiar rush: I didn't want the book to end.	1999-01-07

It was meaty, thick, you can really sink your teeth into it. You can *learn* from this book, about sexuality, gender issues, dancing, environmentalism. It's chock full  of facts, thoughts, philosophies. I loved it for this reason. As far as its  descriptive detail it is not an evocative story... No brilliant or rich  imagery, no character you completely fall in love with, no plot that makes  you breathless with expectation. Those aspects are present, and fairly  solid, but not extraordinary. I would recommend this book to those who take  an interest in the world-building and sociological aspects of science  fiction, and predict it will be something of a disappointment for those  looking primarily for a &quot;great ride.&quot;	1998-12-29
US	52944541	R3UI4C15ONRLOJ	0061012165	349949287	Glimmering: A Novel	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	This book takes work to read, but may be rewarding.	The book never unites. It operates in strobe. Glimpses, snapshots, snatches of imagery, implications of plot. It's hard work to stay with the characters, to remain curious and invested in their activity with minimal  help from the author, who deals scenes like playing cards with quick flicks  of the wrist.<br />One of the miracles of style in the story is the  recurrance of characters passing like ships in the night. Passing blindly  almost without exception, because not one of the characters realizes the  serendipity, the proximity, the intersections; not one of the characters  seems to see the thick fog of fate or destiny that blankets  everything.<br />So the reading is difficult. The visuals come and go. The  myriad descriptions of drug-induced moods and visions mix unreliably with  what is trying to be description of the real world. But it was hard for me  to tell, while reading the book, whether the lack of coherency was the  author's mistake or the author's point. You know?	1998-11-16

The writing style is like a piece of modern art:  sometimes abstract and filled with strange brevity. The issues of the story  are raw, emotional, and distinctly adult: feminism, dominance and  submission, sex, power. <br />'Black Wine' is not a &quot;fun&quot; escapist  storybook -- it is a highly stylized and challenging piece of literature  that invites you to read closely and see deeply. If you seek challenging  literary fiction, I highly recommend this book to you.	1998-11-02

Some short, some long, these essays are everything from quick and wandering dialogues to beautifully crafted essays. They're not necessarily *about* anything in particular. The only thing they have in common is that  the authors, many of whom will be known to you, use a fairy tale as a  sounding board for their miscellaneous ideas... on girlhood, feminism, and  storytelling. They are of wide variety (some are less ambitious than  others), all engaging. The only downside is that it's a quick read -- more  like reading magazine articles than an absorbing non-fiction book.	1998-11-02

Despite a few clumsy transitions from description to action here and  there, and despite an awkward timesharing between super-magical and  super-real, this book is excellent. The characters are vivid, real enough  to touch. The historical magic is handled intelligently and with a sense of  high drama (if even well-done melodrama turns you off, beware). The book  has style and strength. The prose is evocative, richly texturely, deeply  involving. The topics range from practical love and human conflict to  cultural issues spanning time and country. There's enough romance - of  people, of place - to fill your head until you're breathless. I highly  recommend it. Highly.	1998-10-29

Straightforward, understandable, entertaining, with an easy-going style, chock full of explanations--both solemn and humorous--and examples--both historical and contemporary. This volume teaches.

You could tell by how charismatic they were which ones were going to die first. And then they landed on the planet and a few characters slowly develop a &quot;misgiving&quot; to foreshadow the later action. They meet cute child-like aliens, and Foster can't help but introduce human-and-alien sex at this point, of course. (He's like that. I guess it sells.) So we have a few people die under mysterious circumstances, and people falling in love and having sex with the cute aliens, and a mysterious human already on the planet who adds to the body count -- and everyone is mystified, horrified, and made nearly insane by the final discovery of mystery of the planet and its inhabitants. And I'm waiting to feel the same sense of &quot;OH MY GOD&quot; as I turn the pages. I'm waiting to be wrapped up in the fitful panic of the characters I just spent the first half of the book being introduced to. But, I tell you, it never happens. The characters seem to feel all sorts of emotions, but the writing never invoked it in me. I mean, hearing the narrator tell me how frightened and freaked out the characters were is NOT the same thing as the narrator spending time to describe something to me that might freak ME out. I was an outsider. It seemed like the characters were poorly motivated to feel what they felt, since the author never seemed to stop long enough to try to make *me* feel anything. I think this book ends up being nothing more than a shallow, superficial action-adventure story gilded with just the faintest glint of science fiction and psychological drama. If that sort of thing appeals to you, then &quot;Life Form&quot; will too.	1998-01-18

If you're going to choose among all the books that criticize computers and the Internet, this is, I promise, your best bet. Calm, rational, articulate, engaging, it manages to be *thoughtful* rather than ranting or over-emotional, which is a common problem that drowns and ultimately destroys the rhetoric of many of Talbott's peers. Talbott's final conclusion, woven beautifully from his collection of sensitive and thought-provoking essays, has everything to do with human beings as well as computers and the Internet: we should remain awake and aware of the subtle consequences of computer and communication technology. Talbott manages--through easy-going qualification and a rational, neutral attitude--to place himself in the role of a guide rather than a preacher. I can not recommend this book more highly.	1998-01-18

As a treatise meant to persuade the reader, its reasoning and language is nothing short of ridiculous. He fails to establish any sort of common ground or reliability. Then he wallows in abusive Ad Hominum, discrediting pro-technology positions by insulting those who hold it. He introduces a dozen red herrings, wasting time justifying conclusions irrelevant to the issues at hand. The book erects an army of straw men as it attempts to justify its rejection of positions by creating then discrediting different and usually weaker positions. More than anything it is a gallery of appeals to emotion, attempting to rationalize its conclusions by appealing to the sentiment of the audience. (There is enough thickly sweet sentiment in every chapter to make Cicero proud.) I could go on, but I'm already leaving this review barren of specific examples in order to deliver as much warning as I can in as few words: this book is nothing more than an irrational emotional outburst against computers and the Internet. It contains no compelling argument, and will drown you in sentimental prose as eye-rolling as any grocery store romance novel. Do not expect Stoll to be your rational, level-headed guide to the dangers of technology. Do not expect thoughtfully compiled evidence, articulate and clever argument, and a reasonable conclusion. Should he have had anything to say, he abandoned it from the first sentence of his project to a weak, wandering essay on &quot;feelings&quot; alone.	1998-01-18
