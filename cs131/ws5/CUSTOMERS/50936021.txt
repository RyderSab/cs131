Secondly, if you want to know what's going on with the war of terror, read this book.  Thirdly, if you want to read what we should do to fight the war on terror, don't read this book.<br /><br />\\"Imperial Hubris\\" is a diabtribe against American foreign policy towards the Muslim world and the war on terrorism/islamic insurgency.  The reason I use the word diatribe is the tone of this book is an angry bitter man.  He also keeps on repeating the same things over and over: the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are a mess, our ties to Israel are hurting us, and we don't have the willpower to win a war; we need to use more force.<br /><br />Now I personally agree with all of his arguments.  I was just turned off by the fact that a) he kept on saying them over and over and over again b) only at the very end did he have anything constructive to say. While it is helpful to point out to someone what they're is doing wrong, it is a lot harder and even more productive to also suggest how one should do it correctly.  Unfortunately Mr. Scheur only devotes the last chapter to this, and it is rather short.	2004-12-19
US	50936021	R9BILEDE0HW9B	0375702687	2416146	Spartina	Books	3	3	13	N	N	Not quite book of the year	1989 must have been a piss poor year for books because this novel is not even remotely a top-rate story.  Its a decent read that passes the time but there are some flaws.  For one, Dick's family is virtually ignored, just people that live and work with him. I really could not tell you a thing about his wife other than she wasn't so pleased about the boat.  His sons? Uh he loved them, beyond that I have no clue.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing is a bit dull; short brief sentences with a lack of flow.  As some other reviewer wrote, it felt like I was reading a story written by a English Comp. 101 student.<br /><br />It isn't a total bore.  I kept on reading to see how he would come up with the money to pay for the boat.  The drug-running stories and his other jobs made the book readable.  Its when it got into his relationship with Elise that slowed things up and made it hard to read.	2004-07-26

I thought the author did an excellent job of creating each character; you get a very good sense of each person in the story. Suri descibes the scenes so well that you can easily picture what is taking place in the building.<br />It is an interesting glimpse into life in Mumbai.  While providing plenty of humor, it also is a good critique of human nature and social issues in India (as well as some issues that are global in scope).	2002-10-23

Thankfullly Yergin is an excellent writer and those 700 pages quickly seem like no burden at all.  \\"The Prize\\" is an engrossing tale of oil that shows how important the commodity has been for the last century and a half.<br />Yergin adds short little stories to his history that add flavor and color to the book. My favorite was about the last British man to leave Iran following the 1979 revolution.  He had just come down with a major sickness when the Ayatollah came to power and he went through one hell of a time to get back to Great Britian.<br />Anyway, the book hardly ever drags and is not boring at all.  The history of WW II is especially enlightening.  \\"The Prize\\" also is a great explanation of why we have such a vested interest in the Middle East.  If you are puzzled by our attachment to Saudi Arabia, you should read this book.	2002-10-15

While Hornby addresses issues beyond relationships this time, he loses some of the spark that was in his other novels.  Unfortunately Hornby seems to be better at humor than writing about social problems in G.B. and the Western world.  On the other hand, there ARE quite a few parts that made me laugh and I smiled plenty of times- just not as much as I did while reading High Fidelity and About a Boy.	2002-08-12

It starts with the JFK assasination and continues until June of 1968, following the path of Peter B., Ward Littell, and a new character, Wayne Tedrow Jr.  The book is filled with typical Ellroy [writing]: corruption, sex, blackmail, etc.<br />Overall, the book is definitly entertaining.  It is far from dull and the book never drags; it keeps its intensity through the whole novel.  On the other hand, I did not find the book to be as good as American Tabloid. I think the reason I didn't like it as much is there wasn't as much character development, and Ellroy seems to be rushing through things, trying to cover all the big events of the mid to late 1960s.  Granted, the book is very very long, but still, there is something missing from the story.<br />Nevertheless, I would recommend this book, especially for a long car or plane ride; it certainly made my 7 hour trip zoom by.  Just don't expect it to be as good as American Tabloid.	2002-07-05

The editors included all the important papers such as the Balflour Declaration, the &quot;White Paper,&quot; various UN declarations, and speeches made by both Arab and Israeli leaders. The latest documents it contains are those covering the Camp David meetings between President Clinton, barak, and Arafat near the end of Clinton's presidency.

I found the story of Starbuck to be somewhat dull and dry at the beginning. While it became more interesting as the book progressed, I never really connected with the story. While it isn't a bad novel, it certainly is not Vonnegut's best.  I certainly would suggest reading Cat's Cradle and Slaughter House 5 over this one.	2002-05-19

If you don't think Israel should exist, you might want to read this book; it'll probably change your mind some.  It also does a fairly good job in justifying Israel's actions in 1967, but lacks in \\"facts\\" when it comes to the Suez Crisis in 1956.  Hmmm,  makes you wonder...<br />In addition, the book fails to address the treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza after 1967.  There is a strong \\"myth\\" that Israel has violated many civil rights of Palestinians.  I was hoping this book would have something on that issue, but unfortunately it did not. It totally ignores the living conditions of Palestinians. That would indicate to me that in fact Israel does opress Palestinians.<br />Overall, the book does have many well-documented facts but it also is very one-sided and does not bring up many of the issues that are present in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  It is a good book, but certainly is not the only book you should read on the subject.	2002-04-28
US	50936021	RVS3BZC9FU3IC	1573225517	138260184	High Fidelity	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of my favorite books	The book is about Rob, a record store owner who, after breaking up with his girlfriend, reflects on his past relationships while also trying to win back his ex.  The story line is quite simple and does not sound that exciting.<br />The story itself is in fact not that lively.  What makes the book worthwhile is Rob's reflections on relationships and pop music.  I thought it perfectly described the thoughts that go through my head when I have been in situations that were similar to the ones Rob is in.  I think the book provides great insight into the mind of us males.  It has been over a year since I've read it and yet I still think about it from time to time, especially when I'm listening to certain types of music and when I'm going through relationship problems.  If you are a woman and are very puzzled about what men think, read this book and you'll have a much better understanding.  If you are a man, you'll laugh and smile at the many things you can relate to. It is a very funny and amusing book and highly entertaining.	2002-04-06

After she leaves Norman, her husband, Norman tries to chase her down and punish her.<br />The first half of the story is terrific.  Stephen King does a good job in describing Rose's fear in leaving and makes her departure quite suspensful.  He also richly details her new life and makes you quite interested in Rose.  King also does a good job in giving her husband Norman a lot of depth as well.  I read the first half of the book very quickly and was very interested in the story.  Unfortunately things went completely south when the supernatural was brought into play.  As soon as a supernatural painting becomes part of the story, the book becomes very predictable.  The only reason i kept reading is I ws curious how Norman would search for Rose and what events would lead to the ending.  Had King not brought in the supernatural aspect (or at least a different type of supernatural event) the story would have been much better and much less predictable.  I am a great admirer of Stephen King and love many of his books, but this book dissapointed me.  I strongly recommend reading an alternative book of his such as The Stand (my personal favorite), Misery, It, The Green Mile, and Different Seasons to name a few.  It is not King's worst book, but not even close to his best work either.	2002-02-26

He focuses on the Korean Peninsula and Japan, and has one chapter on the financial crisis that hit Asia in the late 90s. His arguement is that the United States should pull back its troops and make fewer commitments abroad.<br />His foreign policy analysis is quite good.  He argues that North Korea and China are not threats to the United States and that the USA should pull its troops out of Korea and Japan.  He has quite a lot of evidence backing him up and he makes a very strong arguement.  His chapter profiling Okinawa angered me and it is an excellent example of another pointless way the USA is bothering another part of the world.<br />Unfortunately the book also brings up the fiscal policy of the United States and \\"globalization.\\"  Johnson is clearly an opponet of it and is quite against the IMF as well.  His criticism of the system lacks in evidence.  While he points out how the IMF made the situation worse in Indonesia, he fails to do it with Korea and Thailand, two other countries the IMF bailed out.  It makes one wonder what exactly the IMF did wrong in the other two countries. Considering Korea was one of the few (i belive only china was the other) countries in Asia to see positive economic growth in 2001, I'd say the IMF couldn't be THAT bad.  It seemed to me that Johnson has a much better grasp with foreign policy than he does with economics. Johnson is so adamament that the IMF is evil that he writes, \\"Capitals like Jakarta and Seoul smolder with the stort of resentment that the Germans had in the 1920s...\\"  To me, that rings of complete hyperbole.  Comparing Jakarta and Seoul is like comparing New York City to Vancouver, Canada.  Jakarta (and Indonesia) is certainly not prospering at the moment, but seoul is hardly \\"smolder[ing]\\" with resentment.	2002-02-21

The main character of the book, Paul Proteus, is an engineer himself, and in the course of the novel he starts to question his job and the society his peers have created.  It is a very funny and entertaining critique of modernization and the ever increasing role of machines in our lives.  The only problem i had with the book was the ending, which seemed rushed and too short.  It seemed as if Vonnegut was not sure where to take the story anymore and therefore decided to end it quickly.  Other than that, the book is excellent; it is definitly worth reading.	2002-02-02

It profiles a serial killer and is writeen as his autobiography.  While it sounds like it could be an interesting story, it in fact is rather dull in many parts of the story.  Supposedly the killer is very smart, but he doesn't come across as that way; instead he seems of average intelligence.  Basically what seperates him from the common criminal is he isn't a complete idiot.  Furthermore, he was a boring person.  Sure, there was the occasional murder but other than that he just drives around the country. I strongly recommend saving your time and reading a different book by Ellroy; I'm pretty sure whichever one you choose instead will be more entertaining than this one.	2002-01-27

From that point, he becomes a significant pawn in the fight for power in Japan.  I personally found it to be a captivating story from beginning to finish.  One does not need to know Japanese history to be interested in the story, although I personally relished it a bit more due to my previous knowledge of Japanese history.  There is plenty of action, political intrigue, and numerous subplots to keep your interest.  While it is a VERY long book, the pace is quite quick and it rarely bogs down.  I personally read it in less than a week and put other things aside just so I could read it.	2002-01-26

That project leads him to a fantasy country in the Caribean sea. The story is very well done; it is quite witty, is full of humor, and is easy to read.  The story reminded me a lot of the movie Dr. Strangelove.  The book makes the nuke arms race seem so trivial and crazy, which it certainly seems to have turned out to be.  It was the first book by Vonnegut I read and certainly will not be the last.	2002-01-20

It is very critical of the War and shows the faults of the War and its negative consequences on American society.<br />The book does not bash just Republicans and the right wing. In fact Baum makes it clear that Nixon's drug-policy was actually not that bad and certainly better than what was to come. Baum also makes it clear that Democrats jumped on the bandwagon and supported the War on Drugs just as much as the Republicans.<br />I was for legalization of marijuana before reading Smoke and Mirrors and now I have even more faith in legalizing marijuana. While I was aware of many things Baum mentions, I did not realize how much the Supreme Court has eroded our civil liberities via the War on Drugs. If you want an engrossing read while learning something useful, this is certainly a book to read.	2002-01-05

His book provides a history of the fast food world as well as analyzes the effects it has on the United States and the world today.  It covers everything from the headquarters of McDonald's to a McDonald's in Colorado Springs to the potato farms of Idaho to the stockyards of Greely, CO where the hamburger comes from.  In the process, Scholosser comes up with a harsh critique of the fast food world.<br />I personally found it an eye-opener.  While I was fully aware of how unhealthy fastfood was, I did not know how much the fast food corporations had changed the food industry as a whole, most notable the cattle industry.  If you need to find some motivation in stopping your urges for Big Macs and Whoppers, this is the book for you.  While I still frequent fast food restaurants, I have cut down on my visits significantly (once every week or two to once every couple of months) thanks to this book.  I also feel guilty in going to a fast food restaurant now thanks to this book, and not for health reasons.  I strongly recommend reading Fast Food Nation.	2001-12-31

It provides a lot of history of S.East asia (focusing on Singapore and Malaysia) and some info on the Navy, while at the same time entertaining the reader with a modern story of piracy.  The only problem i had with the story is an even that happens to one of the main characters.  Not to reveal too much, but she does something that totally contradicts her character and totally does not fit in with the rest of the story.  Thankfully it does not ruin the story and I heartily recommend it.	2001-12-31

The only other good part of the book is it starts out with an exciting beginning.  From there it goes downhill very fast.<br />First of all, the President Jack Ryan, is constantly bitching about domestic politics; most of it is criticism of the left-wing.  Do we really need to hear Clancy's rants about politics in a FICTIONAL book?  A book about foreign affairs no less.  I kept on rolling my eyes.  I have no problem with Clancy voicing his opinion, but you'd think he'd come up with a more professional way of doing it.<br />Secondly, the whole scenerio is unbelievable.  China attacking Russia?? And why does it attack Russia? Because of a trade embargo imposed by American citizens over the death of one fellow american and a cleric.  Sorry Mr. Clancy, but your average american isn't as radical as you are and neither is the Chinese government.<br />I admit, I didn't finish the book.  I got sick of the political viewpoints of Clancy that I kept on having to read plus I just gave up on the rationality of the actions taken by the characters in the book.	2001-12-31

They range from fire fighters in Idaho to guerilla fighters in Afghanistan. My personal favorite was one about a group of westerners who were kidnapped by muslim fundamentalists in the mountains of Kashmir and held as hostages.<br />Many of the articles in the book are on subjects that have been well publicized and covered: Kosovo, Kashmir, Afghanistan, and Sierra Leone, but there also a couple less covered subjects, most notably whale hunting in the Carribean sea, which i particulary enjoyed. While the book does not provide much new insight into the well-covered events, it does provide an interesting glimpse into life in Cyprus (another article) and the world of whale hunting. I did not realize what a dangerous job whale hunting was until reading the book.<br />Overall, it is worth reading ...	2001-12-29

It was in fact really boring and did not inform me of much.  Basically it told me what i already knew.  While I would have no problem with that if he had some new spin on current events, he did not have that &quot;new spin&quot;.  Instead it was just another stereotypical critique of modern society.  I must have missed the humor in the book somewhere because I rarely came across something that made me smile, let alone laugh.<br />Stein does seem as if he's pretty open-minded and he comes across as a reasonable man.  I do think he rants a bit too much about feminism.  While I understand where he's coming from, I think he makes it a bigger issue than it really is in today's world.  On the flipside, I did think he had very legetimite concerns about family life and raising children in the States these days. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more had I not expected him to be more like Rush Limbaugh and less like a moderate Republican that it seems like he in fact is.	2001-12-25

Perhaps they just chose the wrong translator.  While the writing certainly isn't top-notch, this is a memoir- a genre that rarely sees excellent writing.<br />The story is interesting. Reading about the palace life was insightful (assuming it was fairly accurate) and it creates an excellent contrast to the dreary life she lived in exile with her family.<br />Even though the author and her family managed to survive and seem to have strong will-power, I still did not like the author.  She comes across as a self-centered woman who has a very high opinion of herself.  Unfortunately that makes me wonder how accuarte her story really is.  While it certainly is unjust to be imprisioned for someone else's actions, I wonder how bad her plight really was.	2001-11-05

I think those that bash the book are ignorning the parts where she points out that it isn't Islam that is the cause for the opression of women, but the interpretation and/or ignorance of some Muslims (or at least who call themselves Muslims :-) ).  The book even put the Ayatollah Khomeini in a somewhat positive light.  I'm not saying it made him out to be one outstanding guy, but certainly not the hate monger that the West made him out to be. The book also pointed out how the Revolution in Iran actually helped out many women in that country. The point is Brooks does is not completely negative towards the treatment of women in the M.East nor towards islam.<br />On the other hand, the book is not totally faultless.  She does not make it clear where she gets some of her information, as some other reviewers have pointed out.  In addition, it seems as though she is a bit ignorant on the culture of the Middle East and a bit too stuck in the Western mind set for someone writing on a different part of the world.  Nevertheless it is a good book that does provide at least some insight into the lives of women in the Middle East.	2001-08-08

Thankfully I did.  Fadiman does an excellent job of showing the consequences of two totally different cultures colliding against one another.  Her book makes it very clear that the Hmong culture is very complex and that the Hmong people are not total dimwits who are closer to apes than humans.  The book also is a good examination of the medical system in the western world and points out some of the system's weaknesses and faults.<br />While the above description might make the book sound a bit too academic and dry, it is anything but that.  The story of Lia Lee captures your interest (and provides quite a bit of heartache), and Fadiman interwines Lee's story with the story of the Hmong's migration to the USA, which is as interesting as Lee's (and at times, about as depressing and frustrating).	2001-07-31

I started reading the book at midnight, and if it weren't for my eyes, I no doubt would have read it the whole way through that night.  Anyway, it is a very entertaining novel that keeps you intrigued throughout thanks to new devolpments and twists in the story.  Ellroy does an excellent job of devoloping the main character, Fritz Brown as well.  I have not read any of Ellroy's other books, but after reading this one, I am certainly going to try another one of his novels.	2001-07-31
US	50936021	R2Y1WALAQAPPW5	1573226882	326942117	Fever Pitch	Books	3	1	2	N	Y	overall good but not great	I am a big fan of Nick Hornby but this book was a bit of a dissapointment for me.  Perhaps I just had too high expectations for the book since I had heard such great things about it and had loved Hornby's novels High Fidelity and About a Boy.<br />For some reason, I just couldn't connect with Hornby and his obession with Arsenal.  I am a big sports fan as well, but apparently not as obessed with a certain team as Hornby is.  What got me was how he could be so obessed with Arsenal and yet fairly nonchalant towards soccer in general.  At least, that's how he came across to me.  In any case, the book was generally entertaining and I did get a good laugh here and there but I wasn't totally enthralled with the book.	2001-07-31

After the fall of the Wall in 1989, the author discovered that was not totally true, and does a wonderful job of writing about the experiences of 5 Jewish families in Eastern Europe during the Cold War.  It was an eye opener for me.  While I knew that the Communist regimes hadn't exactly strongly supported Judism, I didn't realize they had launched such strong anti-Semite campaigns (or pogroms).  Very easy read and it teaches you quite a bit about post-War Eastern Europe.	2001-07-25
US	50936021	RCJ86MMPKL8H8	0465087922	160189150	The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Informative and interesting but a bit dry	overall, it is a very good book.  It has tons of information, and one learns just how precarious the Korean Penisula has been since the Armistace back in 1953 (i think that's the correct year).  The only issue I have with the book is it is a bit on the dry side and it is clear a journalist wrote the book.  That is, it does not go in-depth much, but instead just spits out the facts and tells it like it happened. In other words, don't expect much analysis of the events or the people involved in those events.	2001-07-25

He makes it very clear that the West was quite hypocritical in its actions (or lack of) and bundled big time. He also does a good job in explaining what happened before and after the massacres, not just the massacres themselves.<br />I also recommend checking out the Frontline show on Rwanda, which just as interesting as this book.	2001-07-25
US	50936021	R2M8SU50FO0NZ6	0312264909	672566972	Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Informative in some areas, dissapointing in others	The strength of the book is describing Khomeini's views towards Islam.  It is very informative about mysticism and Khomeini's attachment to it.  On the other hand, the book is not very detailed and I was yearning for more insight and information.  There is little detail on the personality and personal life of Khomeini.  Instead, the author focuses on the events that take place during Khomeini's lifetime more than Khomeini's life.  In other words, I would recommend it for those who do not know much about history of 20th Century Iran. For those who have even a basic understanding of that period of Iranian history, I would not recommend it.	2001-01-10

Learned quite about Araft.  The list of people they interviewed is quite impressive; those people they did interview make the book what it is.  Very easy to read and engrossing as well.	2000-12-08
