In War Made Easy, he turns his attention to the War on Terror, and fully dissects current US policies.  He conclusively demonstrates how the government spin has been the key to enabling our leaders to sell us a never-ending war and how they have used this to boost their popularity.  The media has played along, I hope the sales of this book will be large enough to open many eyes around America.	2005-07-26

Dan Kennedy has a remarkable ability to describe his life's catastrophes without being either too glib or too serious.  This allows the reader to relate to his problems, but in an enjoyable way.  Following his progression from warehouse employee, to firefighter, to working at an espresso stand, and his reasons for choosing and then abandoning each leads to a truly engrossing story.  In particular, the description of his performance at an open-mike night in Texas will blow you away.  <br />Dan Kennedy's writing moves the story along, and the story itself is great, this one is not to be missed.	2003-09-17

This book will change the way you watch the news.<br />Like many others, I saw the author interviewed in Michael Moore's &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, amd went out and bought &quot;Culture of Fear.&quot;  As a news junkie, this was an astonishing read. For years I've felt a growing sense of nervousness, manifested by the restrictions I put on my children. After reading Glassner's book I am much more aware of the print and other media's scare tactics. <br />Using abundant examples, Mr. Glassner examines the headlines, separates the truth from fiction, and makes it clear why we are afraid of the wrong things. This book will help you avoid being mislead by the media, and change the way you look at news coverage.  Can't ask for much more than that from a book, can you?	2003-08-22

By twenty, she is anorexic, looney, and is being stalked.<br />The characters in Personality are astonishingly complex &amp; well described, the plot is not particularly compelling.

Halfway through I considered just putting it down, but I didn't have anything else to read.  The &quot;plot twists&quot; are fairly obvious.  The action is repetitive, moving the money again, going to another casino, etc etc etc...  By the end I didn't really care what happened, but was just determined to finish.  All in all a suprisingly weak effort from a talented writer.	2003-08-13

It chronicles the decline of civilization due to a self-help book that actually solves the worlds problems, and makes everyone happy.  Will Ferguson's writing has improved dramatically since this book was written, but this is far and away the most clever book that he has written.  The events are forced at times, and it shows all the trademarks of a first novel, but it is extremely amusing nonetheless.  Certainly worthwhile for a light and original summer read!	2003-07-08

Slander, her bestseller from last year, quickly became notorious for its errors and distortions of the facts (a quick google search will lead you to these). In Treason she takes her attacks to a new, and altogether astonishing level. <br />Describing everyone with viewpoints that differ from hers as traitors, Coulter states that she believes that liberals are intentionally attemtping to destroy the United States. She explains to us what a patriot Joe McCarthy was, and how those who support freedom and liberty are guilty of Treason.<BR> <BR>Coulter in general, and this book in specific are prime examples of the worst in American political commentary. Rather than attempt to present a viable viewpoint, Coulter distorts facts, takes quotes out of context, calls her opponents names, and lies (with lots of footnotes).  Personally, I'm of the opinion that calling ones opponents names does not serve to further any just political cause.	2003-07-08

While I hate cliche's, frankly this book is about &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;.  It explores how the Oakland A's have been consistent winners while mainting a low salary.  They have managed to do this by figuring out the characteristics of ideal players who can really help the team win.  It is fascinating to read about how simple some of these stats are, and yet how elusive they were for the rest of the teams.  <br />For the businessman the challenge is clear:  figure out ways to win that the competition has overlooked, and success awaits you.<br />An altogether brilliantly written book, I've already given copies to several people in my company to read.	2003-07-07

This book doesn't really add that much info beyond the LP Hawaii, I suppose the only reason to get this book is if you have no intention of going near any of the other Islands.  But in my experience plans change, and on one trip we added a side trip to Molokai at the last minute (a 30 minute flight), after reading about it in the Hawaii guidebook.    <br />Having said that, this is a good book, and if you are flying direct to Maui &amp; home again this book is a bit cheaper and lighter that the Hawaii guide.  Either way, you should be taking one of the LP guides with you.	2003-06-27

I've found that by taking this book along with the Lonely Planet (which is the best overall guide but is weak on lodging &amp; restaurants) I have all the info I need to plan &amp; enjoy my vacations to Hawaii.<br />I've used this book for travel to Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island, and have never found any of the reviews to be far off base.

But I was hooked almost immediately, and this book has changed my life.<br />As far as the book goes, I was very impressed by Mr Warren's chapter a day for 40 days approach.  Although I frequently wanted to read ahead, I made myself stop.<br />For the message, the bottom line is that many of us feel unfulfilled.  Mr Warren leads us to a simple method to direct our mental energy, and focus on what is important.  This book has led to me have a more fulfilled life, and I am truly more at ease and focused.  The less religious reader will need to focus on the message, not the source, but this is easily done.<br />Bottom line, I couldn't have been more impressed by this book or by Mr Warren.	2003-06-26

We all know Dubya is fairly dim, this 'scrapbook' shows how he might document his time in office (ie with crayons).  It does get repetitive, but scores big on originality.

Carville really gets under republican's skins, mostly because he makes such a compelling case for a liberal agenda.  Carville clearly explains why education funding is so important, and how funding continuing education can be used to SAVE money in the long run (by moving people off welfare).  This book is largely based on the idea that &quot;the only two respectable things for someone between the ages of 18 and 65 to do are woking or getting yourself educated&quot;, and the government should help facilitate this.  Since this book was written, the US has moved away from Mr. Carville's philosophy, so if you agree with him, reading this book is pretty sombre.	2003-03-04

I've heard many commentators claiming that the Clinton administration deserves no credit for the economy during their tenure, and complete blame for what has occured since.  Mr Begala does an amazing job of debunking these myths and proving that it is far more accurate to associate the current disaster with the current administration.  And unlike so much political commentary, Mr Begala provides so much data that it is nearly impossible to discount his claims.  We could use more sane voices like Paul Begala!	2003-03-04

But you owe it to yourself to do so anyways.  Greg Palast skewers the American Press, providing details of their unwillingness to publish controversial, but critcally important, information.  And everything he says is documented with facts, facts, and more facts.  In this new edition, information is provided to prove that over 50,000 eligible voters were blocked from voting in Florida, and the proof was provided by none other than faxed information from Katherine Harris!  Details of the Bush family dealing with the Saudis is equally disquieting.<br />Greg Palast now publishes his stories exclusively in Europe, since the US media is unwilling to publish stories they consider too controversial.  This book will shake your faith in the media, and open your eyes to stories you'll wish you had seen when they were originally published.	2003-02-26

In the beginning, our narrator, Jack Forman, ominously reveals that \\"Things never turn out the way you think they will\\". Jack is a Bay Area high tech manager who has recently been fired, for exposing corruption in his company. His wife is in charge of a team that has been developing a kind of nano-spy plane.  These nano-planes are intended to be a swarm of micro-robots that can fly to remote places and, acting in concert, send back a visual image.  The team is using a piece of software that Jack wrote to control the swarms of nanoparticles, and hence when they get out of control he is called into the Nevada desert to try to help reign them in.  As the battle rages, the nano-swarm begins to demonstrate what is referred to \\"emergent behavior\\", ie their tactics evolve.  <br />As the plot twists & turns, I found myself drawn in and glued to this book.  While it may not be fine literature, it is a tremendously enjoyable read.	2003-02-25

Now, I'm of the opinion that Clinton went a long way to opening himself up to these attacks, however the fact remains that the attacks were vicious, well funded, well coordinated, and effective.  At the end of the day, these attacks on the president were successful, if we can define ruining the public image of a sitting president as success.   In the end America suffered as a result of this, and we owe it to ourselves to understand what really happened.  This book is a good starting point, but you will need to read it with an open mind, since it will likely contradict much of what you have seen in the media.	2003-02-25

Savage resorts to name calling far more often than he provides any facts to back up his arguments.  Example:  Tony Blair is \\"Third Way Führer Blair\\".  Why?  Because he is in the wrong party.  Of course, Savage now thinks Blair is a prince (check his web site)...  Liberals?  As much a threat as Al Quada.<br />Savage misquotes scientific research from the University of Tokyo (claiming it pertains to global warming, when it doesn't).  He tells us that the divorce rate doubled in 30 years, when in fact it increased 30%.  He attacks ritalin, as a way to slam Hillary Clinton, while ignoring the children who ritalin helps.<br />Now, I suppose this book is primarily intended to outrage, as such it is a success.  Perhaps Mr. Savage really believes intolerance will solve the problems he is presenting, I don't and therefore can not recommend his book.	2003-02-19

Mr. Gold narrates Charles Carter's discovery of and fascination with Magic as a boy, his rise from doing card tricks to headliner, and his final confrontation (more detail would spoil it!)  Many additional themes run through this book as well, I kept being amazed that this could in fact be Glen David Gold's first novel.<br />Throughout this novel we encounter many historical characters (Warren Harding, Houdini, Farnsworth + dozens of cameo appearances), but in a fictional setting.  I found this to be fascinating, and I enjoyed doing some research on these people's real lives as I plowed through \\"Carter beats the devil\\".  If the devil is in the details, he must be in here, since Mr. Gold doesn't skimp on them.  Truly original, and genre busting, this is a novel not to be missed.  Encore!	2003-02-17

Perhaps this is why he makes conservatives so angry.  But this is healthy, if he makes conservatives angry, he is clearly accomplishing his goal.<br />Moore's style is to pull no punches, this is a refreshing counterbalance to the PC reporting that we are deluged with in the mass media.  Whether you agree with Moore that Bush stole the election of 2000 or not, it is interesting to read so as to understand the reason that such a large percentage of Americans are outraged by what took place.  While I had mixed feelings about \\"Downsize This\\", I can highly recommend Stupid White Men.	2002-08-27

The listing of B&amp;B's &amp; condos is extensive, if you are more interested in hotels, the Fromers guides have better listings.  This book provides directions to some sights you would almost definitely miss otherwise.  For example, on the drive to Hana there is a lovely swimming hole (with waterfall) about 30 meters from the road but with no signs leading to it.  I would never have found this, and it was a higlight of the drive.  Numerous other examples (this is one of the few books with details about Molokai), but the bottom line is that while most of the guidebooks list identical sights, this one goes into much more detail.  If you are looking to lose the crowds and find some quiet places on your own, you need this book.	2002-08-22

Man, I was amazed by how silly &amp; poorly written this was.  Not sure who this Halperin guy is, but he sure isn't related to Helprin.	2002-08-12

US	42171877	RH38QNGGXO0WX	1573221937	319964836	How To Be Good	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Different	I loved High Fidelity, Fever Pitch, and About a Boy.  This one is quite different.  It is darker, and quite depressing.  It is, nonetheless, well written and certainly outside of the mainstream.  BUT, while I could completely relate to the characters in Hornby's other books, this one failed on that count.  It did leave me a touch satisfied by how much better my marriage is than that described in How to Be Good, but I doubt that was the objective.<br />This one IS worth reading, but be prepared that it is NOT like Hornby's other books.	2001-09-11
US	42171877	RK3DQQRY7EC1U	0684864975	389232995	Slab Rat: A Novel	Books	1	1	3	N	N	Unfortunate	A tale of 2 books.  The first half is great.  The second is a let down, poorly put together, and simply doesn't work.  Looks like a deadline approached.  Ironically, much is made in this book of reviewers giving novels positive reviews since they know they are supposed to.  Perhaps that would explain the positive reviews written on the cover.  Honestly Ted, was this irony lost on you?	2001-09-10

Every character is one dimensional, every development is implausable.  I won't be purchasing anything else by Mr Halperin, I can't remember ever having been this disappointed by a book.	2001-09-10
