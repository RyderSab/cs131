Another reviewer mentioned she was \\"brutally raped,\\" it was not extreme. But quick & embarrassing. These feelings come up again when Bel & Hawk get intimate. Flashbacks! Then chemistry between the couple feels awkward. Blah. Most the book is just a lead up and come down around one good sex scene the author, or someone else, penned.    There were moments I couldn't get past. Bel first sets eyes on him and she thinks along the lines of, it feels like I've known him f-o-r-e-v-er... cliche. And I couldn't believe the duel, (without giving anything away, haha); it's something so predictable you just guess it! And, the end? Say \\"Cheese!\\" I won't be reading any more of this series.	2005-09-14
US	35182360	RWQTWHGMS6ETB	0440221080	849749795	Sea Fire	Books	3	2	3	N	N	slower than the first	I loved 'Island Flame', the 1st book. I could not believe there was a sequel. Yes with the same main characters from the 1st. It wasn't an easy start reading Sea Fire, then when I got in to it, Jon provoked even more outrage in me than before. Unbelievable -- revisiting this couple was sensational.     Some of it was disappointing, like their baby on the beach during a long awaited love scene. I could not enjoy it w/out thinking of the baby left alone on the shore!. And the end fell short. But I wouldn't have missed it!     If you liked Woodiwiss's style in 'Flame and the Flower' you'd enjoy this. But of course, read Island Flame 1st.	2005-08-12

(it's suppose to contain clues to where Captain Jack's treasure is buried). Jared rebuilt the family shipping business and now takes his turn in trying to locate the long-lost diary. This eccentric country girl, who got hold of the diary, is interested in legends and considers herself a \\"woman of the world.\\"  She may have the skills to de-code the diary -- so Jared ...waits...     While it's an interesting plot, I thought more could have been done with the details of the legend, the ancient objects that were referred to, and the treasure itself. Most of the story revolves around Jared playing tutor to her 3 nephews. There was no 'treasure hunt.' A fun light read, if you're in the mood for something cute & different.	2005-07-28

It didn't overdo the twin thing - or the enemy thing - or even the annoying mistress who was mostly just mentioned in reference. Okay, it was a lot of the typical but extra enjoyable.

There were more elements throughout the story questioning her being a real angel or perhaps nuts(?). But for the most part I forgot what she was. Daemon is a true tortured Kinley MacGregor hero/lord. The villian was perfect and added humor. Glad I found a copy.<br /><br />\\"Cast to the mortal realm by an evil sorceress, Arina had more than her share of problems. She was trapped in a temptress's body, tormented by untested passions, and doomed to lose any man she desired. Yet even as Arina yearned for the safety of the pearly gates, she found paradise in the arms of a Norman mercenary. The villagers said Daemon was the devil's son, but he was only a man plagued by strange dreams--visions of a tantalizing beauty who enchanted him like no other, Then the enticing stranger appeared in the flesh, and he vowed nothing between heaven and earth would keep them apart. But to savor the joys of his very own angel, Daemon would have to battle demons--within and without--and risk his very soul for love.\\"	2005-07-20

He is a nasty viscious cutthroat. I waited on the fleeting moments Cathy was able to wring a drop of kindness out of him.    Jon was a neglected child who left home at sixteen to sail. Later, he became a pirate; committing robbery on the high seas! Not a licensed privateer, buccaneer, a sailor w/ a cause, or anything otherwise excused.     Yes, there were the misunderstandings as other reviews noted, but compared to other writers ... the conflicts didn't drag out. The build-ups and anticipation kept it exciting without being frustrating.     I loved it!	2005-07-20

He doesn't guess she's an innocent legit lady. A+ for sexual tension. It's my favorite by this author, though it's not said to be her best.
