This is a very good program (esp the Fat Flush Fitness book, which isn't here) but it is NOT a permanent plan for Pitta types (medium build and body weight) but primarily for those whose heredity and natural propensity lead them toward overweight and obesity. Indeed, an excess of sour (lemon) and tart (cranberry) which is recommended here, would cause an imbalance in Pitta body types - which although they may weigh a few extra pounds, do not tend toward obesity - and cause them to become irritable, have frequent headaches, and their skin to break out. In fact, the diet and general lifestyle recommendations of this diet are geared toward Kapha types, who do tend toward obesity. If you don't know what I'm talking about (Pitta, Kapha) check out \\"A Woman's Best Medicine\\" by Nancy Lonsdorf - or if you're a man, anything by Vasant Lad, Scott Gerson, etc. - which explains that different foods and behaviors, while helping some body types actually cause imbalance and illness in others. This is extremely important and as I have been through the trouble of taking on diet plans that were not for my body type, can attest it isn't worth it. I assume that most people looking for a good diet are the kapha types anyway, but the writers here act as if this plan is the only plan. They are way off.	2005-09-01

And, that she's a great CIA agent, if she did say so herself. Yet when reading the book I felt as if I were witnessing someone speaking very slowly to someone very stupid, who did not have a vocabulary above the 7th grade. E.g., \\"Disdain\\" \\"majority\\" and \\"psychiatric\\" were by far the most advanced words in this book. She also tells us repeatedly that she is a Harvard grad and an overachiever.     I do believe she was an agent, though. Even if the CIA will deny it and she can't put it on her resume (so how would anyone know?) her writing is so boring and the situations so average that a novel writer wouldn't WANT to make it up!    Here are some sentences from this Harvard overachiever -- i just opened the book at random:   \\"One year earlier, faced with the decision--Fulbright or CIA--I hadn't known what to do.\\"   \\"'How would you like to work for the CIA too?' I now asked.\\"  \\"After I'd explained for the umpteenth time...\\"     Even still, I can't help think she is talented. The grammar and spelling are mostly impeccable. But unless you'd be surprised to find out that a polygraph test is \\"harrowing\\" or that being a spy diminishes one's \\"prospects for ever tying the knot,\\" stick with Ian Fleming.	2005-03-03

Ok, if this book doesn't indicate that she's given us all she's got, i don't know what could. First, the book is about triple the size it needs to be, considering how few recipes are actually in it, because the type is HUGE and the pictures are MANY. When I think that Gourmet has just published a massive tome that is actually useful, and only charges less than TWO more dollars than this, I'm ashamed of Ina. And, I'm a huge fan. Love her show, love her earlier books, love her magazine columns. But it is plain now that she didn't have another book in her. Throughout the book, to mask the fact that the recipes are the same ones everyone's been cooking since the Silver Palate, she says \\"your friends will love this!\\" \\"your friends will love you for it!\\" \\"your friends ....\\" blah blah blah. I don't cook because I'm insecure about what my friends think. I don't think i need your book. Besides, I already use Sheila Lukin's recipes -- and my friends love me when I do! I should've backed away from the book when I saw the pictures in the back, where the Paris shopkeepers look embarrassed .. clearly a warning.	2004-12-28

Why would professional publishers choose the one color known to be unreadable by at least 1 out of every 100 men? And make it so expensive? I have to say I did try the duck with clementine sauce and it is as good as Ruth says it is ... frankly, i was so amazed i don't think i'll be able to go back to my old way of roasting duck. I just think you should look this book over first and see if it inspires you before you go ahead and buy it.

Parenting is so difficult, not just because children are so impressionable and innocent, and yet so demanding, but also because parents themselves cannot help but regress to their own childhoods. Books like this help to keep parents sane, reminding them that their good intentions will not heal the human race until they are aligned with the natural and healthy development of each individual personality that is in their care. This book provides much evidence of the importance of a more intelligent approach to mental, emotional and physical development than is currently employed in the vast majority of US schools. The games and suggestions she gives are easy for anyone to employ, no matter how tired or overwrought a parent may be! I'm especially pleased about her comment on swimming -- my niece was a competitive swimmer from a very young age, and although she was nationally ranked for her age, development of her muscular & bone structure became problematic (and expensive!) during her teens. (Why no one mentions this when they talk about how Michael Phelps can't walk or run properly is beyone me!) But not only parents should read this -- it's so easy to understand, that I'd give it to the babysitter too... they have just as much influence on your child as anyone else.	2004-11-29

I think it's a sign of where society is headed, considering our past. We're finally ready to let go and let people just be themselves. That said, I hope men read this too -- so they realize that if they ARE into someone, they better step up! It definitely debunks Dr. Phil's bullsh**, and instead asserts that when a guy is into you, he wants to marry you even when you're an a**hole! (i'm living proof!) I've always hated how Dr. Phil would go on Oprah and have guys give stupid reasons why they wouldn't marry this or that woman. Puleez. We all know too many married people who WE wouldn't put up with. However, I can't endorse this entirely because of personal experience. My friends & I have, many times, been attracted to someone who wouldn't give us the time of day. Later, we found out they were into us, they just didn't have the guts. And vice versa. So, the truth is -- when you feel something that strong, it's a high probability that it's mutual. When will people just break down & admit that? Maybe in another 20 years?	2004-10-21

I read this book a couple of times a week, it's so interesting, full of information and guidance. After reading the negative reviews here, I had to speak up. I've made authentic Mexican food with Mexicans and Mexico is all about improvisation -- no matter what anyone at Gourmet Magazine will tell you! In fact, the mole sauces that are so famous, are just sauces where their creators put everything (including the kitchen sink) into the sauce, in the hopes of a splendid creation! It's in their history g-dmmit! And if you've ever been in the kitchen with a Mexican guy, he'll put all kinds of things together. Despite what his Grandma does. [In my experience, the only thing they don't seem to mess with is Chocolate. They will laugh their head off if you so much as ask for a moccachino!] And Rick tells you all that in here -- if you want to make the traditional dishes, get his other book. This is for those of us who want to pick up some chilis, some beans, and have a good time! [the only recipe that didn't work out was the chocolate pecan pie .. it was obviously untested. just use a larger pie plate (9.5\\" or 10\\") -- do NOT make it a 9\\" deep-dish -- and roll out the crust accordingly. I tried to make it a deep-dish as he says, and it didn't cook evenly.]	2004-10-04

I can't believe I still find information in here that can't be found in other VBA &amp; Excel programming reference books. I have so many of them, and I always find that this book keeps me on the right track where others drop off. It's definitely true that one must keep several Excel &amp; VBA books on hand because they all have incorrect info here and there, and no one volume covers everything.

I'm only writing this review to make sure that people understand that though it's difficult to believe Penelope Smith because of her stilted writing style, if you need further clarification on the validity of communicating with insects and other creatures, try reading &quot;Behaving as if the God in All Life Mattered&quot; by Machaelle Small Wright, &quot;Kinship with All Life&quot; by J.

In fact, &quot;Behaving...&quot; actually tells you how it's done and I've used the technique to rid myself of roaches with NO pesticides whatsoever! And believe me, I was OVERRUN by them in my Brooklyn apartment. Having been an animal communicator myself for several years after being quite skeptical, I must say that there is no validity in negating the possibility any longer. If you're interested in the subject, by all means do not stop at Penelope Smith! Try reading the other books I've mentioned, and you'll see what I mean.	2004-02-19

I am sorry to say after reading this book that I am officially \\"over\\" Amanda Hesser. This one is cute at the beginning, & grows repetitive by the end. Since her writing has improved immeasurably since these were published, it's pretty sad to read this shallow, pretentious account of a somewhat uneventful life. She holds up her small professional cooking experience as though it makes her more qualified than others, then complains about why she couldn't prepare a simple meal in alone in someone else's kitchen, implying that it was somehow their fault! When she whines about Mr. Latte's taste (not bad) or behavior (relaxed) it's hard to sympathize -- one wonders if she's trying to invent reasons to feel sorry for herself. Her subtle put-downs of people far more accomplished than herself (e.g., Ismail Merchant, Cook's Illustrated) and of American cuisine in general are sad and show poor judgement. It appears that her family's meatloaf is more sophisticated than the rest of America's! -- Underwhelming, to say the least.	2004-02-19

Wherein we observe the development of a girl from 5th grade to about age 27, a girl that we eventually realize is quite attractive, though she has the persistent belief that she's a Dawn Weiner. It could make a great film. While I think Lucinda Rosenfeld has a good ear for dialogue and gives us painfully well-executed visuals, to the point where I felt I had been there myself (because, what young self-involved American female hasn't?) I thought the writing tired and too desperately-trying-to-be-trendy. It's the kind of book that would've made an impression about 10-15 years ago, but now the market is just too saturated, and let's face it - descriptive language a la Confederacy of Dunces has been immitated ad nauseum. Judging by the age of the character, Rosenfeld probably did write like this 10 years ago (in college), so it's too bad she didn't try to get it published then. Now, though, I think she'd be great writing for current female TV characters -- could give them something interesting for us to watch!	2003-03-11

So far I am not only impressed with this book, but genuinely thrilled to have found a really gourmet cookbook for balanced, healthy vegan meals. If I'm having people over they don't even notice there's no meat. It's so elegant, and the ingredients come from across the globe (you do have to carry a lot of groceries for some of them!). The issue I think someone would have is, one must have access to good health food and specialty stores and special produce. You have to have a food processor, blender, spice grinder etc. and the recipes have many elements so it takes a while to complete. But the results for me, so far, are wonderful. I wonder if the person who found it bland was using old spices and substituting ingredients? I am a trained chef, and I think the recipes are somewhat complicated, so can imagine that the average cook might find some of them time-consuming to reproduce adequately. If that is the case, my advice is, make sure you've got the necessary equipment, get fresh organic produce, grind your own spices (or use brand-new ones) and leave yourself an entire afternoon to do it right.	2003-03-11

The writing is really upbeat and the sarcasm never gets grating.

The writing is so boring that it reads like a term paper written by someone who couldn't care less. The information on the history of pastry is at times inaccurate (which wouldn't be such a big deal but they should have fact checkers, right?) and even a photo at the beginning of the book was mislabeled, in a way that showed the person thought no one would be able to tell. Other captions should have been left out such as &quot;Pineapple&quot; underneath a photograph of a pineapple. On the other hand, I always love to hear what chefs have to say, and this is no exception. It's filled with recipes, there is a useful table of interesting flavor combinations and lots of good statements from pastry chefs, though much of it is the average deal -- about how important the quality of your ingredients are and whether to make a tower of food or to keep presentation simple -- so, while I personally enjoy this kind of thing, I recommend it with reservations.	2002-10-09

Sentences like: \\"Rather, you must take the night steamer from Boston, which deposits you at the Grange House pier before teatime.\\" Or: \\"And though I watch for it, I am never prepared for the first sight of Grange House on its point, though I know the approach, and early learned to read where the slick black shale ledges of the shoreline turn to the white granite boulders marking the entrance to Middle Haven's harbor.\\"<br />Having read the whole novel, I now think that if only she'd just left off the first 3 paragraphs, the whole book could have gone a lot better. Oh well. The fact is, because of the strength of this friend's recommendation I gave the book another chance and by the third chapter was totally wrapped up in the gentle yet mysterious world of Grange House. So much, in fact, that I resented getting to my subway stop each morning and having to come back to the real world! I finally got so frustrated that I just took a few hours off and finished the darn thing! <br />About all I feel safe telling you without giving away the story, is that the author weaves a gentle and mysterious story following a teenage girl who finds herself on an investigation of the lives lived in Grange House. It has elements of each of the Bronte novels, with a sprinkling of E.M. Forster. The author drew me in so far that as she lets us in on delightfully intimate Victorian letters and diaries of the characters, I felt guilty for infringing on their privacy! If you can ride out the precious language for a bit, and forgive the attempts to be original that produce a sentence like: \\"...for Mama's fear of the fog would dampen the spirit of the voyage, and Papa's cheery dismissal of that fear would only clamp shut her lips,\\" the sensual and mysterious atmosphere will seduce you. If this is your kind of thing I highly recommend this book.	2002-09-30

Take the story of Father Arguedas, a recently ordained Catholic priest, who is certain his love of opera must be a sin, and even though his confessor tells him it is not (excepting some of the libretti, of course) he still prefers Russian operas because the language is the least like Latin, so there is no chance he'll understand the words and get caught up in the lusty plots ...<br />References to tragic opera run through the book and most of the characters have names that come from famous tragedies in literature and opera (Roxane, Esmerelda, Cesar, Carmen) so if you look up the operas or recall the literary references, you'll get an idea of who's who and what's what. <br />All in all, though, I didn't think there was much to \\"get\\" as it is a sweet love story and gives a humorous and subtly profound soap-opera twist on terrorists and hostages, South American culture, and the struggles of all people in the world. The book sucks you in gently, until you've just got to find out what happens!	2002-09-12

I don't think anyone in modern days has ever explained the Catholic sacraments or the Jewish Sephorot in such an accessible and globally conscious way. Over the years as I have worked with the Vedic energy systems, I have often wondered how to tie it into my Catholic and Jewish upbringing -- it's easy to connect Ayurveda to Eastern medicine but it has always been in the back of my mind, that there had to be some link to the West, but I couldn't find it. Thankfully, Ms. Myss has done the work for all of us! The result is a profound and powerfully persuasive argument for individual autonomy and accountability -- no matter what belief system or religion one subscribes to. Her main message seems to be that we all have the tools to know everything we need to know, to have everything we need and to experience life as a constantly enlightening and enlivening process, at all times. In some spots she makes general statements about political events or historical figures that ignore many of the facts, but those offenses are minor and mainly serve to get specific points across, I guess. One thing is for sure -- anyone who listens to this series will be affected in some way, and I for one cannot imagine them not being better off for it.	2002-08-05

I can't help but believe it is premature to call this a new kind of science for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Wolfram - though obviously brilliant - is doing something others have done long before, and continue to do, though his purpose and method are singular. I don't understand why he is so adamant about excluding everyone else and taking 100% credit, as if he were a spoilt child told to share, and so gives up the smallest cookie in the bag.  Secondly, though this book is an excellent work on the study of patterns, and could make a huge contribution to simplifying research, the book never addresses the fact that beyond the naked eye, solid forms are mostly empty space. He doesn't seem to have solved the problem of what programs will put the particles in place that make up forms at this level. Instead he just deals with more superficial appearances, even when showing three-dimensional forms. Without this piece to the puzzle, I can't help but wonder why he is so insistent on the superiority of his method.<br />The most interesting thing about this book is that while few (if any) scientists will defend Mr. Wolfram in his claims, scores of journalists (read: dilettantes) are leaping to the cause, explaining the work better than he does in the book, and even chastising the science community for being jealous.  Since I am just an armchair reader on science and math subjects, I can safely say that the book is not daunting for the general public, because it is written in the style of a conversation. This conversational style includes Wolfram constantly referring to himself throughout the work, and to his ideas as if the reader were desperately curious as to how he sees the world. (This is a kind way of saying he comes across as full of himself quite often.) <br />All told, however, this book provides much food for thought. Hopefully Wolfram's ideas will be found useful, and lead to more innovation in scientific research.	2002-07-08

In White Teeth, Zadie Smith assembles quite a cast: The bumbling middle-class Englishman, the Jamaican Jehovah's Witness, the Pakistani family divided between traditional parents and rebelious children, and a Nazi-esque white family masquerading as do-gooders. <br />The first 1/4 of the book is so full of cliches and been-done Brit Chick Lit banter that I almost put the book down (there should be a law against referring to \\"pass-go-collect-$200\\" by now!)...thankfully, when the second section starts the cliches disappear and the story starts to get (somewhat) interesting. Without giving away details, I can say that readers will find some very original writing mixed with a lot of \\"let's all get along\\" preaching and mild paranoia about \\"what white people are really thinking when brown-skinned people aren't around\\" along with one or two Biblical misquotes. <br />Unfortunately the obviously talented Ms. Smith leaves the cast where they are at the beginning, dragging the story along without allowing either the plot or the characters develop into a worthwhile read.	2002-05-23

Comfort Me with Apples reads like a continuation of Tender at the Bone (a fantastic memoir). I found myself enjoying it but at the same time, wondering why it was published. <br />It is mostly about how she met the famous chefs who created American cuisine in the 70s and 80s, the main message put across being, 'I was there at the beginning. I saw it all. I have a right to write about food.'<br />The stories about her sex life were put in disguised as explanations as to her life choices but still made me wonder why they were there, when she is still so young. She sounded as if she believed she was being judged. But by whom? Was it to convince people that she had lived and wasn't just a nerdy writer? I couldn't tell...<br />The chapters about her short travels to Thailand and China read like articles in Gourmet magazine -- again, I wondered why they were here, when that's really what they were.<br />I think this book would have been better if she'd waited a few years and not been in a hurry to tell so much, so soon. But I still read it through to the end, and did find the stories at the end very touching.	2002-04-29

It is a great work by a highly regarded psychiatrist and thinker, well researched, and readily useful in applying to one's own life. For myself, this book (along with The Drama of the Gifted Child) helped to liberate me from the lies of my family and confront the abusers of my childhood without fear, dread or resentment, for, as I gradually accepted the facts of their lives as well as my own, I could accept the havoc they wreaked on mine, and finally take unashamed responsibility for my own life.	2002-04-25

As far as I am concerned, most of the more recent modern writers on the subject have little to add to works like this one. Here is a highly respected and successful therapist, who went out on a limb and confessed to her colleagues, at a time when she could have been basking in the glory of seniority, that she finally realized she only went into the field to learn how to heal her own pain; and then had the courage to withdraw her membership from psyciatric associations once she realized their hypocrisy (which she took full responsibility for in herself, as well). <br />In this very fine but brief work, Alice Miller studies pivotal works of art and compares their content with the life stories of their creators. The resulting analysis is impeccably true-to-life and highly plausible. She does not trivialize art in doing so, but makes a sound case for how artistic expression could be the great liberator of mankind, and brings us to even greater respect of the artists she discusses. Whether they knew it or not (probably not?) their unrestrained creativity is presented as a gift to teach and inspire us all, subconsciously or consciously, whether or not we choose to analyze it ourselves.	2002-04-25

Not because it is a great literary work (it is) or because it is so important (which it is), but because in it Mark Twain exposes himself -- his nostalgia, his bitterness, his resignation, and his hope for his own life and for post-Civil War America with brutal frankness, and yet humorous approachability. <br />The novel may be called \\"Puddnhead Wilson\\" but the most memorable character is a highly intelligent slave woman named Roxana. Through Roxana and the rest of the townspeople living in a pre-Civil War Missouri, we find some of Mark Twain's most oft-quoted statements among biting characterizations of the American mentality. <br />I cannot recommend this little book enough. It has its weaknesses (so many critical essays have been written about them that it's unnecessary to discuss them here) but they are really minor and certainly do not detract from the sheer enjoyment and contemplation that it gives the reader. Not to mention that the apologetic forwards to both Puddnhead Wilson and Those Extraordinary Twins are brilliant short letters from Twain on writing.<br />I cannot speak about Those Extraordinary Twins because I've never been able to get into it, or read past the first chapter. It's extremely odd, being about a circus freak -- siamese twins joined at the hip -- with each side having the complete opposite philosophy and constitution than the other. That is, one side drinks alcohol and doesn't feel affected while the other side gets drunk; each side has different taste in clothing; etc.	2002-04-25

Far from being hilarious, I think the appropriate descriptive adjective is &quot;disturbing.&quot; Despite the maxed-out genre, though, this book does have some original writing. The novel starts innocently and humorously enough (&quot;enough&quot; being the operative word) but as Helen's story unfolds, it reveals a family paralyzed by dysfunction, the humor not so much dark as unaware. Helen becomes less attractive as the novel wears on (rather than talk, she &quot;bleats&quot;) and the fact that she even has a love interest becomes more and more implausible, as we watch her lash out at the poor soul and then read his equally nasty retorts (when they've hardly even dated yet!). I was surprised Ms. Maxted was able to bring things together enough to write an ending. I think the book demonstrates talent, but I wish it had been directed toward achieving something more worthwhile.	2002-04-24

I had never cared much for King Arthur or those ridiculous Mallory translations except to watch Monty Python illustrate their absurdity. This book took me by surprise. I could not do anything til I had finished reading it! (To the 13 yr-old reviewer, I say -- wait a few years.) I picked it up again twice during my 20s, because so many of the images remained in my mind, and coming back to the world of Morgaine was a welcome respite from demands of life &amp; work. Now in my 30s, and though I find the attitude of the women in here to be too negative for my taste anymore (I guess women have become so much more liberated that we don't feel like complaining as much?) I still believe it is one of the most mystically inspired books ever written. I put this book up there with Jonathan Livingston Seagull, The Bridges of Madison County, The Joy Luck Club and all other books that just seem to pour out of the Universe onto the pages. Others of Ms. Bradley's books are child's play in comparison, and do not even merit reviews. But this one -- obviously written at a time (it seems) of uninhibited creativity -- is a rare and wonderful work.  Read it if you're a woman, read it if you aren't. Read it if you love the Arthurian legends, read it anyway if you couldn't care less. Allow yourself to be led into the mists, and go on an unforgettable journey into this imagined past ... when you come back to the present, you'll have experienced a strange initiation and life will never be the same.	2002-04-24

He shows himself to be proud, horrid, loving, sentimental. It is a small collection of short, powerful stories that span from childhood to young adulthood. He refers to himself at times in first person, other times in third (so you have to pay attention!). Growing into manhood, observing others and being observed. He expresses experiences of personal pride and humiliation with equal relish. Portraits of others in his life are humorous, admiring and at times sad. Hanging out with odd-balls; learning about women. It may have been a simpler time for technology, but the emotional struggles, the economic realities, the physical exertion required in a life in early 20th century Wales were harsh. All-in-all, this book is unforgettable.	2002-04-02

Her refreshing style recalls the work of Marguerite Duras and Simone de Beauvoir -- succinct but never terse. The stories unfold and reveal their characters gradually, and we don't get to know the narrator of each story entirely but just listen as she quietly experiences relationships with family, men, children, strangers, and work. It's kind of like Slaves of New York without the raunch, or Sex in the City without the desperateness.	2002-03-30

Most people reading this Brit Chick stuff now don't realize Lette started in the late 80s and had all of this material covered by the end of the 90s, when Bridget Jones caused a craze. But did that stop me from reading this all the way through? No!!! It is a good enough story about a selfish girl who learns to think of others and get a handle on what's really important in life (blah blah blah) and reading it helped me get through a few airports. If I'd been at home I think I'd have put it down a lot sooner, though.	2002-03-23

It not only explains in detail how to do the simple excercises, but gives many scientific explanations for how and why they work.<BR> <BR>For those who don't know, Brain Gym is a method whereby brain functions are accessed by performing simple physical movements, and it has been found to profoundly improve ADD/ADHD/Dyslexic conditions as well as other learning disabilities. It is a series of exercises (drawn from all areas of movement -- from the calisthenics we did in phys-ed class to the eye exercises of behavioral optometrists, to acu-pressure points) specifically studied and narrowed down after many years of research to those that were found to optimally affect brain functions. Luckily they are all easy and take only minutes (or even seconds) to do, and they get immediate, verifiable results. In my experience they help students and professionals of all ages learn faster, improve memory and coordination, and generally reduce the stress of adjusting to new situations or learning foreign or difficult tasks. <br />In my own experience, I no longer teach violin without integrating Brain Gym exercises because the students learn so much faster and develop better technique because they are more relaxed, naturally. I have also taught Brain Gym to writers, musicians, actors, doctors, mathematicians, teachers, dancers, investment bankers, producers etc. and the feedback is consistently positive. If you are a teacher and are interested in this kind of thing, classes are recommended, but the next best thing is to have this little book!	2002-03-13

It has redeeming qualities, however: the entire book is just questions from people who seem to be skeptical about intuition and spirituality, with very well thought-out answers by Eckhart Tolle, who is very down to earth and not flaky in the least. His main point seems to be the importance of using intuition and not relying on logical thought alone, accepting that the intuition is tuned into many more of the consequences of our actions than a person's logic can possibly understand on its own. If you are interested in investigating this subject deeply with someone who is articulate and well-spoken, then this is the book for you. However, at times he writes as if a person cannot know what to do until they make a judgement about what is WRONG, and then go the opposite way. This is great if one is an addicted personality, but not for someone who is just looking to be balanced and open, free of the strain of always having to judge others and oneself. If you're wondering whether this book is for you, I hope this gives an idea of what's inside.	2002-03-13

There are so many books about the hexagrams, but not many go into enough detail as to how to really USE them from a practical perspective, and leave the reader to figure it out for him or herself. R.L. Wing's interpretations of each hexagram are more detailed than one usually finds. As the other reviews indicate, Wing keeps a impartial distance, however, and that requires the user to read between the lines to apply them to their own circumstances. <br />For each hexagram, he gives several paragraphs where one gives an interpretation if you're asking on a personal matter, another if the question has to do with career, another if your question is about family relationships, etc. For myself, I used it heavily when I found myself in a new job or with new acquaintances and found it to be extremely useful in navigating the political ups and downs and figuring out who to trust. I spent a while asking deeper and deeper questions into each area and it helped me to transform my professional relationships and find a more meaningful career. Thanks, R.L. Wing!	2002-03-05

The pictures give you a profound inner sense of the truth of each throw of the coins, transforming the experience into a deeply effective tool for inner growth. Not to be confused with the Art of War or the Tao Te Ching, the I Ching focuses mainly on political relationships and the development of character as one navigates one's way through professional and personal relationships. The main thing you'll get from using the I Ching is, to learn which situations you can definitely change and which ones you should just let pass. It also shows you where you are in the development of goals and what to prepare yourself for, as you go on. Start with one question, and when you read the answer, if you have deeper questions, ask them too. You'll get amazing answers.	2002-03-05

I've used it to help myself and others on issues relating to health, relationships and work, with wonderful results.	2002-02-19

The exercises are extremely gentle but when you look in the mirror afterwards, you look calmer, softer, eyes open wider. Reading this book helped expand my understanding of the concept of our actions (down to how we pick up the paper) being WHAT we are, showing WHO we are, without needing further interpretation. I purchased the book because I was impressed with the results I'd seen in others, and I haven't been disappointed.	2002-02-19

Being a self-taught programmer, I find some of the text a huge bore and mainly use the code examples, rewriting it to fit my needs. I do not waste my time going through his exercises because they seem laborious and I need fast answers. For that, however, it has proved itself invaluable. I will admit that the examples are so plain vanilla in here that you have to know how to use Excel and VBA to apply them to actual situations. Without this book, though, just having those manuals isn't enough. It really fills out the missing info. When you find yourself stuck, you'll be glad you have it.	2002-02-19

The most remarkable thing about Findhorn is that it is a flourishing garden with plants from every climate (even tropical), growing many times normal size, in sand in Scotland, of all places! Throughout the years horticulturists have tested the soil and declared the results incomprehensible, even impossible. Findhorn also does not use pesticide, but instead talks to the insects and makes agreements about what the insects eat and what they don't (after all, we wouldn't have anything without them and they should get their share of Earth's bounty!). The candid thoughts in the book, simply expressed, gave me the shivers, they felt so true. I can only read it in spurts because after only a page or 2, there is so much to digest and think about. The pictures are only in black &amp; white, but I find myself constantly looking at them in awe of the Joy and Life coming through in the people and the plants. This would be a great book for environmental scientists to read, as we move into a unique time where serious decisions will have to be made about natural resources and how to use our waste. The Findhorn community presents an idea that things would be so much easier for us if we allowed the veil to come down that exists between man, beast, and the spirit world. According to them, the Universe is full of helpful entities who genuinely WANT life to continue and for us to create heaven on Earth.	2002-02-15

Years ago, Glenn Doman was a pioneer in research on dyslexia and brain processes. It was through Doman and Delcato's work that the need for crawling to activate the right and left hemispheres was discovered. Since the 1960's education and research has come a long way from there, but the basic ideas have not changed, and Glenn Doman has held to his theories with religious fervor! While I would not want my child to attend his school or go as far as showing them Gray's Anatomy before the age of 7, (the children at his school never seem very happy to me) I can easily recommend THIS book without reservation. It has all the relevant information for you to take or leave as you wish. It demonstrates how simple activities that all children delight in (and already DO when left alone) are actually exceptional tools for brain development. And, it isolates and explains the ones that have the most powerful effect. <br />This book helps parents understand the role of these natural inclinations as it shows them how to encourage and assist the child by creating an environment where its instinctive movements and curiosity can be followed through safely. This is invaluable at the very time now believed to be most crucial to the development of a child's quality of life. <br />Whenever a friend or relative has a baby, this book is my first gift to them. The ones who try the exercises tell me they notice a positive difference in their child almost immediately (in areas of comprehension, coordination and overall intelligence). It has clear and colorful diagrams, development timelines and large pictures. It will be necessary to get past Doman's zeal if that kind of thing turns you off, but if you take what you like and leave what you don't, this book will prove itself invaluable.	2002-02-12

In this book Dr. Paul Dennison gives unique exercises to aid anyone in accessing and speeding up mental processes by first doing simple physical movements. Drs Doman and Delcato originated the concept in the 1960s (when they discovered that crawling was essential for brain/body coordination and development) and Dr. Dennison has followed it through in a most remarkable way. Since this book was published, many advances have occurred in Dr. Dennison's research and I have taught his exercises and principles for years to musicians, actors, dancers, doctors as well as high school and college students, who all found the work to be indispensable. In my own life as a musician, chef and graphic designer I have found the exercises to be highly useful. If this subject interests you, I also recommend \\"How to Teach Your Baby to be Physically Superb\\" by Glenn Doman, and \\"Smart Moves -- Why Learning is Not All in Your Head\\" by Carla Hannaford, PhD.	2002-02-12

When I finally got to that line in the 1st volume, I felt like -- why don't more people just know it? It's so simple. And true. Of course, it's in the middle of a lot of prayers and automatic writing stuff, and stories about how to apply Russell's ideas, but I loved reading all of it. It's a book to meditate on and apply to all aspects of life. One day life on Earth will be much simpler and life-affirming, and people won't have to look so hard for love and joy. The ideas in this book can help bring that about. Let's hope, soon!	2002-02-12

But many do not provide proven, accessible no-cost methods for achieving immediate, verifiable results, such as one finds in this indispensable tome. There couldn't be an easier way to learn about and use the most innovative and useful concepts in education today, than reading this book. Through simple physical exercises (developed by Dr. Paul and Gail Dennison with a team of researchers), Ms. Hannaford, who is a neurophysiologist, proves that mental processes are accessed via physcial movements and can be significantly improved with little or no difficulty. <br />I originally began using these exercises for myself as a professional violinist, to improve concentration, relaxation in performance and just general handling of stress on stage. It was so helpful I showed it to my adult amateur students and they learned new music far more rapidly than would be normal for their level of skill. Over the past 13 years I have taught these exercises to actors, musicians, doctors, teachers, writers, etc. in New York and have gotten consistent results. The best part of it is, each exercise takes only a few minutes or for some, a few seconds. They don't cost any money (unless you want to take a class or see a specialist) and I can do them backstage or in the bathroom or anywhere, really. It's terrific. If you're interested in brain development in children, especially babies, I also recommend \\"How to Teach Your Baby to be Physically Superb\\" by Glenn Doman. Enjoy!	2002-02-12

This is a man who was an architect of a building still standing in New York city, yet he never went to school past the 8th grade. He sculpted the Mark Twain Memorial, though he never studied art. He even created the Co-op system for housing in New York (but later denounced it as politicians and real estate developers caused the system to degenerate into the state it's in now). I love to pass this book around to friends -- they always appreciate it. I highly recommend this introduction to his highly unusual experiences, philosophy, and unique relationship with the Universe.	2002-02-12

It is a surprisingly humble story about how Edward Espe Brown became the great chef and teacher that he is. He writes in the same simple style that won me over years ago in the Tassajara Bread Book. I don't believe he intended this book of &quot;Recipes and Reflections&quot; to be considered a cookbook (since he's already done so many of those by himself and with others), but to inspire cooks and would-be cooks to explore the wonders of the Universe, via food or any other avenue they might choose. For me it was very inspiring, both personally and professionally, and for some reason I often think of this book and the things he's said, though I read it over a year ago. Since I didn't try any of the recipes scattered throughout (although I found some good ideas in them) I cannot comment on that. Just, I've found this to be one of the most enjoyable and encouraging reads on cooking, teaching and life in general.	2002-02-11

She focuses on the paradox of the outwardly talented, attractive and well-connected woman who at the same time, hasn't been brought up to know herself outside of the Cinderella/Sleeping Beauty fantasy and maybe never will. I did not find Four Blondes &quot;hysterical&quot; (as the jacket said I would) but the stories brought up, in Candace's typically breezy style, many of the issues I and other friends of mine have faced as single girls in 90's Manhattan. I love the flashes of insight I get when I read her writing, into myself and people I know.<br />Candace does not seem to be looking to shock or entertain, just describe. Her stories (or rather, extended observations) do not contain situations of tension and release, discovery of life's purpose or transformation of personality. Atypically (from the usual fiction written for/about women) her characters do not feel pressure to change from within but mainly focus on how to get more of what they want, clueless about what to do in the areas of their life most lacking. Through it all, Ms. Bushnell does not try to steer her characters into an honorable direction. They can be self-centered and hopelessly superficial, yet she does not judge them and their choices but instead sticks to portraying them truthfully, with all their warts. Though she writes with a light hand and hip dialogue, her characters come through seeming at once powerful and sad.	2002-02-08

The book is a real page-turner as it moves into Dorothy MacLean's spiritual adventures while she and the Caddys created the impossible-by-all-scientific-accounts garden at Findhorn, Scotland. It got to the point where I just couldn't put it down but did-- just so it wouldn't end! The messages she wrote down from the devas (her word for celestial beings that hold the blueprints for all of matter) are direct, simple and comforting -- but also haunting in their admonitions to mankind to work on an intuitive level with nature and have the courage to reduce the consumption and accompanying waste of our natural resources, which, as they very clearly communicated, creates a divide between man and the spiritual forces of the planet. As Albert Einstein said: &quot;Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.&quot; <br />Toward that end, I have found this book to be profoundly inspiring as I go about my not-very-extraordinary daily life, and I find myself thinking of Dorothy and the Caddys often as I seek the best possible solutions for my own daily problems. It has definitely expanded my own relationship with the world and my own infinitely smaller (but no less important) role on the planet.	2002-02-04

This book has a charming cover and wonderful printing. It makes a nice gift for young people (they'll probably keep it in the bathroom?). Ms. Padwa's writing style is engaging. In the introduction she says that although this book is not thorough, it &quot;has the facts you need to hold your head high&quot; -- that said, I was disappointed to read a few misguided &quot;facts&quot; within the book.  Perhaps this is because she admitted to poring over books and articles but did not mention any conversations with actual people. And, with the number of contradictory books and articles on every subject, this method would have to produce somewhat flawed results. The flaws are annoying but forgivable, and since she writes as if she is having a pleasant conversation, I still open the book to random pages and read a bit from time to time.	2002-01-30

I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to \\"get into\\" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement.	2002-01-30

She does not have a pathetic childhood and does not live her life like a victim. Her source of attractiveness lies in her personal beauty,  intelligence and moral character, and not in madness, meanness, or carrying the sceptre of victimhood. The charm of the story is in how it unfolds so I will not give anything away. As for why it hasn't been more successful, all I can say is, I do not believe the novel was less popular in its time because of any technical flaw on the part of the writing. More likely, it was because this character would not settle for the acceptable place of a woman in Britain during that time. While reading her story, one cannot help but believe she deserves everything she thinks she does. The circumstances in the novel may have created sympathy for her righteous indignation and kept it from open criticism but the readers at that time might have been uncomfortable with the clear implication that it was time for women to claim their equal rights alongside their husbands -- a point made with palpable spiritual authority.	2002-01-30

He definitely backtracks on some of his recipes in the Cook's Bible (he tells you where) but he also talks about how he improved the recipe here. To be sure, I have modifications in mind for my own taste on several of the recipes, and find the &quot;master recipe&quot; concept for things like mashed potatoes amusing, but this book's results are very enjoyable home-style cooking. One major feature for me was that I've been used to the organic produce and variety one finds in NY, but there, that wasn't available.

Also, she keeps it very simple to the point that, though I haven't started on one yet, I can easily see that the shapes and designs are basic enough that one can leave the more complex details out and still have a great looking result. In that sense it's her least intimidating book so far!

But even those very brief comments only offer the type of information you'd get in an 8th grade classroom. Also, this book is mainly for inspiration, not direction. She says at the beginning that if the reader is a beginner, to read the whole book ... but I find it hard to believe with the spare directions that any beginner would be able to actually use the book. They also said in the jacket that detailed diagrams are displayed -- when in fact they are just a sketch of the finished product, that you can see a picture of a few pages later. I got the feeling these were part of the filler. However, I do like how, on the pages where she shows a standard technique or a decoration she uses, there are several pictures of details from different building facades and references to art and history. Looking at the pictures, I felt as though I was standing next to her, getting inspired by everything around me.	2001-09-24

I would hate for someone who could be helped by this book to read a couple misinformed reviewers and shy away from trying it. So, just to jump into the discussion, I am a teacher of kinesiology and acupressure, and to the reviewer who found incorrect information, I wish to say the following:<BR>It is indeed valid for the authors to say that points for a specific meridian are the same on both hands, because there are so many different schools of acupuncture that it would be ridiculous to claim that one is right and the other wrong. The exact location of acupuncture points is today and has been debated throughout history. Additionally, the exact path of each meridian is extremely intricate and impossible to illustrate. Hence, books for lay people only show general paths, which are the same on both sides of the body. These are useful but not exact, and millions of people use these very general interpretations every day with great results. Additionally, it would in most cases be impossible for a layperson to flood a meridian with the &quot;wrong&quot; Qi, for 2 reasons: a) they are not a professional and therefore do not know the specific steps that would cause an imbalance, and b) contrary to the teachings of many &quot;new age&quot; methods, a healthy meridian can handle energy going in any direction. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the subject to try the simple methods in this book, and see if it works for them.	2001-09-11

She is thoughtful and spiritual, and nobody's fool! As for her work with nature, she proves that insects are not &quot;pests&quot; but vitally essential to life on Earth and gives a viable alternative to killing or using chemicals to reduce the insect or animal population, an alternative that I have adopted with success! This book has transformed my relationship with the world.	2001-09-10

The first part of the book explains how to balance meals using the Chinese 5-Element system, which really helps in overcoming cravings for junk foods. They also label the recipes so you can figure out how to fit them into the system. I have to admit I've mainly used the book for this purpose. For the recipes, I adjusted them to suit my own taste, and found them satisfying.	2001-09-10

A good place to start	With this book, I started at the first fall menu and started cooking my way through it. It's been totally doable. The recipes are so simple and laid out with directions of what to do first, second etc. that preparing entire meals with dessert gets faster with time. (She includes a healthy dessert in most of them.) I have noticed a couple mismarkings that would've affected the whole dish if I hadn't caught them, and while some of the recipes are really wonderful, others are just plain yuck! (I know it's health food but sometimes it goes too far!) As for flavor, it's definitely on the side of the old \\"healthy\\" stuff. If you're looking for the creative haute-cuisine vegetarian/vegan stuff you can find today, this is not it. However, the meals make me feel good and satisfied. They are so balanced, I find I don't crave sweets afterwards. The suggestions for what to do with the leftovers are really useful. Also, if you are nervous (as I was) about using all of these strange ingredients, the directions are simple enough that you'll become a pro in no time. One more thing - my complexion has really improved since I started using this book.	2001-09-10

It seems trite to say she is &quot;courageous&quot; but yet cannot think of a better word. (I don't think I'd be able to do it!) And she does it with so much insight that telling it all has a real purpose and is not self pity. She clearly has come through a lot and is to be commended for sharing her newfound insight with those of us who are too good at hiding the truth to get proper help! I spent some years living a sexually compulsive life and have found the path away from it to be long. At this point I can't even recognize myself, I've changed so much, but still found reading this book to be very healing and affirming, and that her insight helped clarify some issues that have come up for me, as I deal with the truth.	2001-09-10

The concept of MAP is simple. It seems embarrassing that I had to read a book to know about it! I have used it since 1995 and the results have been quite amazing. I started using it for physical health and gradually moved into using it for mental/spiritual health and relationships. I eventually began to use these principles to improve the quality of my work, and to move into more congenial and fulfilling work. For anyone with concerns after reading other reviews, MAP is 100% FREE to use, and MSW states that quite clearly. It does not require the purchase of any expensive items, merely a request. The use of flower essences is optional. The recommendation to use them is merely for educational purposes and for the simple fact that using them helps one to feel grounded -- active -- in the process. Sessions are conducted when one is alone, which has saved me alot of $$ on medical bills, and has made the times I do see a doctor far more productive.	2001-09-10

This book was written over 50 years ago - I don't have a copy in front of me but I'm pretty sure it's pre-1950s. It is true that he tends toward a Christian perspective, but I just tack on my own metaphors in their place. The reason I like this one is I find that this book very accurately predicts the future, and even possibly saved my life on one occasion.

I found this a fun book about the industry, and covered chefs not in Dornenberg &amp; Page's books, because these chefs were still on their way up.

She says - don't ever totally lose your vices, just act like you are trying to, and lengthen the time between relapses, so your partner thinks you need him to help you get over it. As he sees the length of time between relapses increase, he will believe he is helping you, and that you appreciate his help. This goes for substance abuse, messiness, tardiness, etc. - anything! This helped me walk away from my ex because I realized that was what he was doing with me (unconsciously, in his case)! That's how I realized he was never going to totally give up his substance abuse problem. At my job, I didn't fix my occasional lateness because I realized, as long as I act contrite, my boss reacts in the way of all codependents, and feels sorry for me, and that we need each other! Of course, this is a basic characteristic of codependent relationships -- what I realized is, don't be afraid of it. This kind of thing is what keeps people together! Ha!	2001-08-08

Because, frankly, the authors have a very dry style and even put me to sleep. But I struggled through those parts of the book because scattered throughout are lengthy stories, advice and recipes from TOP chefs of all types and ethnicities, from around the country, and what they have to say is tremendously interesting. In this book are also surveys including what books were most important to the chefs and I went on to read many of them, and also studied with one. I learned a lot about the industry and each individual chefs' contribution to culinary development in America. The authors have done a great service to the culinary profession and to food lovers, by publishing this book. BTW - this is one I don't even let people borrow!	2001-08-08

I was intrigued by this because a) it is a combination of Eastern and Western medical knowlege and b) a friend had done some on me and I felt great. I took the classes and it was so easy that I immediately used what I'd learned on fellow musicians, actors, dancers, and helped my friends when they got sick. Needless to say, people soon started lining up backstage in hopes of a treatment! I recommend the classes but the book is so thorough that you don't even need them. The book is mostly very clear diagrams of the muscles, acupressure points and energy meridians, and explains what to do with them very succinctly in the beginning of the book. And I definitely get over colds and flu faster since I use TFH right away when I feel under the weather.	2001-07-12

This is what she wrote prior to the conception of the series. This is the truth. The series is what sells on HBO. I have lived a few of the more pathetic scenes and was amazed at how well she wrote it. Not since 'Slaves of New York' has someone captured the way it is so brilliantly. I put this book right up there with Edith Wharton, Dorothy Parker, Clare Boothe (who wrote 'The Women') and their ilk. It is so sad and yet remains hopeful. It tells the bitter truth without gathering pity. And still has a sense of humor.	2001-07-12

One night I'd eaten a 2-day old bean soup and was up for hours with nightmarish gas. Finally I remembered I had this book and sat up, rubbing my eyelids and ears and large intestine just the way he recommended. The gas went away and I was totally rejuvenated.

It's a great introduction to the subject, but not for use afterward on a daily basis. Also disappointing, it does not contain a dictionary of symbols and/or typical sightings in dreams.

It is simply written and discusses alternate ways to look at life's conundrums in a gentle and informative manner. Among my friends, the ones over 35 find him rambling and simple. I cannot say whether Mr. Moore's translation of Greek is accurate, but I do think his analysis of Narcissus is not only on the mark, but different from every other interpretation I've come across.

I use this book along with others and also some Jungian theory. I use this one the most. Unlike the other reviewer, I believe this book DOES go with consensus but you have to know how to use it. First of all you have to get the version with the pictures. I've seen the one that is just text and it's badly organized. (Don't know what they were thinking.) To use it, you have to look up each thing you remember from the dream, individually. So far I've used this for myself and others and most people tell me it's been right-on. Keep in mind this was written in the 1800's so the vocabulary and references used are old-fashioned, and he tends toward old biblical platitudes.	2001-07-12

In this small book there is a surprising amount of information on Jackie and Letitia's entertaining style, in stories, beautiful photographs, recipes and anecdotes. I especially like how she includes descriptions of the table settings (tablecloths etc) and menu choices, with short explanations of why they were chosen, and how they parted with tradition in many cases. It also provides a peak at the highly talented guests outside of politics whom they entertained, and how they entertained them! As other reviewers said, the recipes are mainly classics.

Masao Maki, a successful restauranteur, has tried many different alternative therapies and religious practices, and traveled around the world in search of himself. I can't forget his impressions of every place he described. For the reviewer who thought it lacked substance, for me there was no need for such a short book to go deeper, because (it seemed to me) he wrote this book to simply present the facts about certain places/gurus (exposing a major hoax in the process!) and it's probably appropriate for him to keep the rest to himself. I have great respect for him and for his journey, and for the people he met on his way.	2001-07-11

In 'People of the Lie', readers will see him more clearly. Although I couldn't disagree more with his premise of labeling any human being as &quot;evil&quot; and especially his patients, I must admit he does give accurate accounts of how people subtly live lies and perpetuate them to the frustration of the unwitting. Other reviews have given plenty of detail on this book but I feel it necessary to add that he leads to reader into an exorcism that only serves to prove its inanity. I now see Mr. Peck as a very angry person who disguises his contempt of humanity behind quietly well-articulated dogmatism. In this book, he stands with the rules of the Catholic Church behind his contempt, and his conclusions make me question why anyone else would want to join such miserable company -- not least, in a psychiatrist!	2001-07-11

She also includes recipes from her youth in America and tells how she came across the recipe for Haschich Fudge.

It really inspires me to go the the grocery and just wing it. To the reviewer who found him arrogant, I say he is no more arrogant than the NY chefs I've met! At least he's willing to give away his personal point of view so we can all benefit! One other thing, for the reviewer who didn't know what to replace with what -- savoy greens can be easily replaced by other greens or some other cabbage if necessary, as are many of the ingredients. If you have questions about this, see Rose Elliot's 'The Complete Vegetarian Cuisine' -- it has full-color pages of beautiful photographs of all the exotic grains, vegetables, legumes and greens, and how to use them, so you can learn what to replace things with.	2001-06-28

He gives a very tedious way to do something very simple.

Even though it is about consumer patterns in society as a whole, it has been one of the most useful of all the books I've read on personal financial management.	2001-06-02

I read this book AFTER becoming successful by doing the things this book recommends. Lucky me. Then, when my company changed to a casual wear policy and I changed my look, my whole life changed. I went from unquestioning respect to constant challenges to my expertise and to colleagues actually acting surprised at my level of skill, when I had worked so hard to build a reputation. Now that I've gone back to serious dress, albeit with only a little casual influence, I have my respect back. And I'm not going to give it up again!	2001-06-02

I listened to the tape 3 times on the plane on the way over to Venice (the tape also has a little pamphlet to read along in the cassette case). When I got off the plane I was able to ask all the questions necessary to get around. People understood me and were very kind. I took the train to Sicily where I was in a car for 20 hours with 5 women, only 1 of whom spoke a little English. With gestures, the book and what I remembered from the tape, I had a great time. Towards the end of my stay I listened to the tape again and it helped me even more. When I needed to take care of something important, the necessary information was in the reference book. It will not help you get into too much detail with the natives, but it will help you handle the essentials and get around beautifully.	2001-06-02
US	50462706	R17UVGG1PPMU9D	0330335278	405627442	Foetal Attraction	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great in every way	Witty, truthful, troublesome, entertaining - this book deserved its success. I love how we find out about the main character gradually, as her experiences unfold, so that it continually makes one question who this person really is. Kathy Lette is a tremendously talented writer with so much to say, and so hilariously, it's hard to believe one person came up with it all. I relived some of the best and worst parts of my life while reading this book and eventually I just had to laugh at myself, as I laughed with the characters! Suffice it to say Ms. Lette tells this young woman's story, faithfully showing life's light and dark sides, and carrying it all through to a truthful conclusion, without degenerating into moral platitude. And never, ever losing her brilliant sense of humor.	2001-06-02

It was hard for me to read, but the wit was so refreshing I had to keep reading, just to get more of it. Kathy Lette definitely enjoys her dark side. I think most young women writers coming out today are totally borrowing from Kathy. From plot twists to sarcastic commentary, you can find everything in one of her books years before the others. I would've given it 5 stars, but it does plod at times and at a certain point, she just throws out one-liners sentence after sentence that are so clever, but need more space to be appreciated. Also, she quotes the prequel to this one - Foetal Attraction - too much. I know she wants to make sure everyone gets to hear her brilliant wit, but she should trust that they will read the other books if they like her. Other than these really minor points, it's brilliant.	2001-06-02

Imagine my surprise to find it in a US bookstore looking sophisticated, on nice paper etc! I can totally vouch for the Scottish wedding bit in the beginning. All in all, it has just enough sarcasm, just enough sincerity, just enough romantic problems and just enough of the ridiculous to be great reading while getting a tan, sitting in an airport, riding the subway - you get the idea.	2001-06-02

Everything he says has turned out to be true. The hand-drawn maps are charming, but might not be adequate for some nervous travelers. I love how he lists the travel times between the major cities -- really helps you change course quickly when on the road! I haven't stayed at his recommended hotels but next time I intend to -- he lists some very good deals in here. I used with the D&amp;K pictoral guide to Italy and the 2 of them complemented each other perfectly.	2001-06-02

It stays with the basic concepts of organization in a way that is on the level of organizing a locker in Junior High, which puzzled me. The only person I can imagine needing this book would be someone who never had to organize anything before. Perhaps a filing clerk just out of high school?	2001-06-02

Covers - for tourist's purposes - the art and architecture of Italy splendidly without getting too heavy. I have to agree with other reviewers that the map of Venice was inadequate. It was nice to get lost there but I found I had to stick to the canal and always walk from there, if I wanted to get a good result with this map. They really need to fix that. I didn't try to use the maps for the other cities, so can't talk about them. I gave it 5 stars anyway though, since it is such a good overall travel companion. And so hard to find it all in 1 book! Use it for the monuments and churches etc., but get separate city maps from the tourist office when you get there!	2001-06-02

There is so much to think about, to integrate into one's life, in this book! A friend read a couple of paragraphs to me and I had to buy the book. Then, I read a couple of paragraphs to others and THEY had to read the book. I will never forget the things I learned here. Another thing -- you really feel the book is so honest, so kind, that it is beyond human weakness and pettiness, so its advice is easy to take. I had heard about Seth for years but didn't understand what it was all about, nor was I very interested. Now, I believe that from the time Jane Roberts started channelling Seth, to now (2001), this work has infiltrated the world and helped to make it a better place, helped to make people more compassionate and live their individual dreams. It certainly has helped me. For that I am truly grateful.	2001-06-01

It is not heavy duty, just a very sweet, poignant story about a girl and boy that made me feel sad it had to end. It's a very quick read, not the great work that &quot;Winged Pharoah&quot; is, but still worth reading. Joan Grant &quot;remembered&quot; this life and wrote it in the form of this novel. She is a very inspired human being and her goodness comes through in every sentence.	2001-06-01

Even if she didn't say it was a &quot;far memory&quot; of a past life, it would be easy to imagine the story is true. She starts as a small girl and her speech is very simple. As she grows, so does the level of vocabulary and conversation, but imperceptibly. Also, this book is so real and yet magical, I wished I was in it! I read a chapter of the little girl section to my 6 year old niece who hated to go to bed and she made me read that same chapter over and over and over in the same sitting! It is sooo beautiful! I've read just a chapter to adults and they had to read the whole book. Make people get their own copy, though -- I've noticed they don't like to give it back!	2001-06-01

I've been cooking my way through this book because she tells you what to do when, so that everything gets done on time and with no problems. The recipes are all easy and will make you feel very confident when you see the result, and I'm starting to get the hang of preparing meals on schedule - feels like she's coaching you all the way. I only gave 3 stars because although my roommate loves the dishes I make from it, I don't think they are the best recipes. They are good, but not great. Like, her recipe for Key Lime Mousse just tastes like flavored whipped cream. The chocolate date bars came out more like a cake texture, than a bar. The chicken recipes are overkill to my palate because her marinades are a ton of spices and herbs that go along with a nationality - Moroccan or Carribean for instance - and personally, I don't think it's a good idea to put so many spices in one dish, then you can't really savor them. I've also noticed errors in the directions that make it seem that perhaps some of the recipes started out as high quantity and the scaling down of them was not perfected. I will continue to use this book for practice though, because for that, it has been invaluable. When I've done all the menus in this book I think I'll have learned a lot about planning them myself, and then I can use whatever recipes I want! 1 other thing - she says to try not to buy ultra-pasteurized dairy products and I don't understand why -- this process is shorter than pasteurization and the end product is purer and tastes fresher.	2001-03-17

Her testimony about the disparity between women and men before ERA is essential to history. Anyone who says that she has been handed anything on a &quot;silver platter&quot; was not a woman trying to make it in the 1950s. Her stories from childhood are an inspiration, especially how she attempts to understand her parents, teaching us all how human it is to fall into despair and hopelessness, no matter how realistic our optimism, no matter how much integrity we think we have.	2000-10-26

I am grateful to Ms. Conway for baring the truth, as a service to those who need to hear it. I can see that her personal rantings have annoyed other readers, but my response was to the contrary. I have had similar experiences in the corporate world as a woman, and am grateful to find someone to back up my observations. Jill Conway proves that she will not back down to anyone who stands in the way of progress when she has a good idea, and those few who interpret it as antagonistic to their agendas, I suggest they re-examine said agendas, and not blame one of the few who actually succeeds in getting things done for the good, in spite of hopeless bureaucracy.	2000-10-26

She gives actual cases, lets you see each person's side of the story, and sums up her opinion in 1 concise paragraph after each one! Direct, and honest. Yet I could not give this book 5 stars because of a couple of clearly unfair biases. For example, in one chapter she tells a woman that her ex-boyfriend does not owe her any money for his education--that she paid for--since there was no written agreement that it was a loan. In a following chapter, where a man wants $700 dollars back from an ex-girlfriend, also where there was no written agreement of it being a loan, she says the woman should pay it back. Are women the only people who need to learn responsibility? Are not these men just as accountable for their actions? I have seen her do this on her show to my great disappointment, and to see it in writing makes me wonder what she can possibly be thinking! She is a judge, and is supposed to uphold the law, no matter what her personal opinion. From what I can see, in the absence of written agreements, one better be a man if they wish to win in her court.	2000-10-13

A little affected at times, but obviously highly skilled. In addition to great stories (although I got a little tired of the repetitive descriptions of the crochety old man after a while) the book is organized by month, so if you're wondering what to have for dinner, just look in the appropriate month and she'll have the seasonal ingredients right there, so you know what to go shopping for, even if you don't decide to use the recipes. I have mainly used the book for this purpose. The recipes seem typical but don't take my word for it. I bet they're wonderful. Also, she gives lots of useful info on culinary history, ingredients and old-time recipes that are woven into the stories so they're easier to remember. Definitely keeping this one.	2000-09-30

I find her rambling and neurotic style a bit unsettling. Even in this book, one minute she's a snob and the next minute ... well I don't want to give it away. Nonethless, I loved it through and through. Much less neurotic or rambling than her other stuff. Marvelous stories. Wonderful points of view coming through.

It is really French dishes with Indian accents (with the exception of some phyllo). As she puts it, Indian cooking tends to disguise the main ingredient while French cooking does the opposite. I learned from her that French cooking is really the simplest cooking, and not to be intimidated by it. And, likewise, not to be intimidated by Indian ingredients.

Everything I've tried has been too simple to be proud of, and yet they make everyone else so happy. It's really one of those basic books where you can make the same thing over and over without getting tired of it. None of the recipes are unusual to someone who knows food, which makes it kind of blase, yet they are perfect as they are. He doesn't pull any star punches here, no long lists of ingredients, no technique. Just simply good food.	2000-09-29

She tells you the truth. I can't imagine anyone not knowing what to cook for dinner if they had this book. It breaks everything down, gives you the big picture, so you realize what those recipes you've been following blindly were trying to do. It's true she has you get pre-made sauces and chicken broth (some Asian sauces should be bought pre-made anyway) and if you actually have time to make them you'll have to open up another book for those things if you're a beginner (who has time these days anyway?). On the other hand, I am so sick of reading cookbooks where the cook writes as if they are performing on stage, which has no relevance whatsoever to what I'm doing in the kitchen. This book doesn't waste your time, gets right down to business.	2000-09-29

Incidentally, I have seen these hors d'oeuvres copied by the best  chefs/caterers in New York. For the pages upon pages of beautiful ideas  alone, it is worth the price. Martha/the staff/the editor (whomever is  responsible) leaves no stone unturned - i.e., every kind of food idea you  have ever seen is here in miniature, and more elegant! I have not used the  recipes verbatim so I cannot say anything about that ... just the many,  many pages of superb visual ideas. This book has changed my plates forever!	2000-09-09

As someone who first loved her stuff and then stepped  back and had to laugh at the complexity of some of those  &quot;projects&quot; of hers, my overall impression on her personal  problems is, So what? Most celebrities &amp; powerful businessmen are  megalomaniacs with family dramas. People who hate her probably feel  inadequate to what she represents, but Martha must feel extraordinarily  inadequate to have built such an empire trying to prove herself! Much of  the boom in cooking shows and quality products now available to most of  America is thanks to that woman. Better produce, better cooking utensils,  nicer stuff at Pottery Barn, etc. Her problems &amp; feelings of inadequacy  about herself have caused her to influence this country, enabling all of us  to have nicer-looking public spaces and better food when we eat out.
