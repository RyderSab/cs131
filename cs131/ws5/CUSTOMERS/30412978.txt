Granted, this is the first biography I have read about Frank Sinatra, so I have nothing to compare this book to.  However, I couldn't shake the feeling that \\"Sinatra: The Life\\" focused heavily on all the negative aspects of Frank's life--the boozing, the philandering, the mob--rather than celebrating all of his accomplishments.  Everything is written in a very hush-hush, so-and-so said this about Frank sort of way.  It appears that Summers has done his research to the extent that he has dug up every quote [mostly negative] made by a celebrity referring to Sinatra.  Therefore, this entire book has a very gossipy, tabloid feel to it.  Summers seems especially interested in Sinatra's mob connections, to a point where at about page 100 I was like, \\"Alright.  WE GET IT.  Sinatra was tight with the mob\\".  This overkill made the book very redundant and tiring, and it took me a good week to finish it.<br /><br />Another issue I had with the book is the way it is organized.  The book is arranged chronologically, however, the authors would occasionally skip back 5 years or ahead 10 (or whatever) making the book a little confusing to read.  For example, one chapter mentions an incident that takes place 5 days before the death of Marilyn Monroe and then the very next chapter discusses a cruise that occured a good amount of time before Marilyn's death.  This jumping back and forth happens often in \\"Sinatra: The Life\\" and it made it slightly frustrating and confusing for me to read.<br /><br />Ok, griping out of the way, was this book a waste of my time?  Not really, I found it to be an interesting read.  Frank Sinatra was definitely one of a kind and I was happy to get some insight into his life.  That being said, I am not so sure that Sinatra fans will appreciate the tabloid feel to this biography.  The entire book was very unbalanced and I am assuming that there are better Sinatra biographies available.	2005-07-12

When I first cracked open Maureen Johnson's \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" I was worried that I was in for a lame \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" knockoff.  I suppose it helps to actually read the flap description before reading a book.<br /><br />The Bermudez Triangle centers around three best friends: Nina Bermudez, class president and born leader, Avery Dekker, a grungy and sarcastic rocker, and Melanie Forrest, the sweet and shy girl guys can't help but crush on.  Up until this point, the girls have been inseperable, however, when Nina goes away for the summer to a leadership camp, changes begin to take place within the triangle.  Three very different girls with different interests and priorities.  Oh no.  Can their friendship survive?  On the surface it sounds tired and overused, and yet Johnson manages to breathe enough life into this YA Fiction cliche to produce an immensely enjoyable book.  The characters are very likeable yet believable, and Johnson keeps her readers hooked with a fun and fluid style.  Most importantly, \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" confronts the topic of sexual identity from several perspectives, an issue that many teens encounter firsthand.<br /><br />Maureen Johnson's \\"The Bermudez Triangle\\" is a fun, endearing, and important read that beautifully illustrates the struggles and confusion of friendship, identity, and growing up.  Johnson is a very talented writer and I will be eagerly waiting for future releases by her.	2005-06-30

This novel has some redeeming qualities, it is funny at times, but ultimately it is a let down.  Ginger Lee, Caroline Hwang's protaganist in her novel \\"In Full Bloom\\" is a late 20-something fashion assistant at A la Mode magazine, a job handed to her by her best friend in college, Sam.  While Sam is a cut-throat professional, Ginger herself shows a serious lack of drive and ambition.  With those qualities alone, I would expect myself to relate to Ginger (haha).  Overall, however, I did not find Ginger to be a very likeable character.<br /><br />While throughout the length of the novel she gripes about how racist (perhaps, ignorant moreso) white people are towards Asians in America, she herself stereotypes and bashes people of her own culture.  She won't date Korean men because they are all chauvanists, and for some reason she's always pictured her husband as a white guy.  Granted, Ginger is an American-born Korean woman, not feeling entirely at home with Koreans or \\"white\\" America.  But instead of embracing her mixed upbringing, she just complains.  The reader is hoping that at some point Ginger will embrace (or at least come to terms with) her own culture (Korean American) and become proud of her heritage.  However, we never witness Ginger grow as a character, she is pretty much in the same boat at the book's finish as she was in the beginning.  Nothing is resolved in the end and the book feels incomplete.  This, for me, was \\"In Full Bloom\\"'s downfall.<br /><br />Hwang's writing is not terrible, but the transitions from present tense to flashback sequence are not very solid and I found myself sometimes confused by a scene that had actually taken place in the past and I was reading it as if it was the present.  This happened on more than one occasion where I had to re-read a page in order to follow what was happening or get a grasp on whether the event was taking place in the present or the past.  This really wasn't such a big deal, just a minor gripe on my part.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are reading this book for a quick chick-lit fix, then you might want to give it a shot, however, if you are looking for something with a bit more substance I suggest looking elsewhere.e past.

US	30412978	R3AMKQK3KNE3LZ	0918273838	340040560	Donald Duk	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Definite Eye-Opener	First of all, I am surprised that not many people have read or even heard of this book.  Why is it that America eats up all the stereotypical, sell-out Asian-American literature and denies something as real and tangible as Frank Chin's \\"Donald Duk\\"?  Instead we are force-fed Amy Tan.  And don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading Amy Tan, she is a very engaging writer, however, the average reader does not know where to draw the line between fiction and fact.  They assume that because Amy Tan is Asian, every word that spills across the pages of her works is the solid truth.  It is important for people to understand this distinction before reading any literature, lest they mistake fiction writing for truth and buy into the stereotypes presented by the author.  Unfortunately, most people cannot make this distinction and their knowledge of Asian/Asian-American culture is limited to what they read in \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" and other such works.<br /><br />Whew!  That was quite a rant :)  Back to the review:<br /><br />Frank Chin is NOT Amy Tan.  On the surface, \\"Donald Duk\\" presents itself as a light-hearted, comedic read.  In fact, the entire premise of this novel seems silly, as do the characters.  However, beneath the surface lie some serious questions about culture, identity, and racism.  With its rich portrayal of history and culture, \\"Donald Duk\\" challenges the abundant stereotypes and misrepresented histories often present in American culture.  Paired with Chin's vibrant and crisp writing style (It took me a few pages before I warmed-up to his style, but once I did I was hooked), the end result is a novel that manages to be eye-opening without being preachy.  A feat that is seldom accomplished.  I don't say this often, but I love this book.  \\"Donald Duk\\" is an entertaining, albeit important, novel that should be introduced to more readers.	2005-06-15
US	30412978	RJDTU4TSV3EBF	0689835906	127191876	Beast	Books	2	26	30	N	N	ehnnnh...	When I first settled down to read \\"Beast\\" I was intrigued by the Persian setting in Napoli's retelling of this classic tale.  When Prince Orasmyn offends a faerie, he is cursed to forever roam the earth as a beast.  That is, unless he can win the love of a woman.  Fleeing his omened death and his fate, Orasmyn leaves his beloved country for India, and ulitmately settles in France.<br /><br />I give Napoli credit, especially since she is working with material that is already familiar to her readers.  Everybody knows that Prince Charming finds Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty awakens, Beast regains his human form.  While \\"Beast\\" begins and ends strong, I found certain elements of the middle section to be almost disturbing.  After Orasmyn flees his mother and father's palace, he encounters two female lionesses.  Napoli describes as Orasmyn mates with the two females.  Considering that Orasmyn is a lion himself, it's not so disturbing, but since he still thinks like a human and has human thoughts it's borderline bestiality.  Furthermore, it's not essential to the plot and not entirely appropriate for a book aimed for twelve year olds.  It remains there for shock value more than anything.  Aside from my quip with that particular scene, the middle section of the book seriously lags in comparison to the beginning chapters and the chapters following his intorduction to Belle.<br /><br />My only other issue with this book is something I have encountered in a few of Napoli's works.  The ending to \\"Beast\\" seems especially rushed.  It's as if the book is just moving along fine and then BAM!  The End.  It left me unsatisfied and frustrated.  I mean, of course the reader knows how the story ends, but Napoli didn't make it her own.<br /><br />The cultural setting of \\"Beast\\" is its most entertaining aspect and it is a quick read.  The characters are likeable, but somewhat distant.  I enjoyed \\"Beast\\" alright but it is not a book I could re-read and it is definitely one of my least favorites by Donna Jo Napoli..	2005-06-07

That is, unless she comes up with a plan FAST.  Hesitantly she calls her estranged childhood friend Holly Jacobson, and by some twist of fate, the two girls are on a plane bound for South Beach, Florida on a weeklong adventure that they couldn't possibly forget.<br /><br />I noticed some people harping on the underage drinking and sexuality present in this book.  While I am 26 now, I was a teenager once in my lifetime and I feel that this book confronts many problems that teens encounter all the time.  In reference to the teacher who took this book away from her student, I feel that if she had taken the time to read the entire book she might not have been so harsh in her review.  YES this book contains underage drinking and sexuality, HOWEVER it also shows tremendous character growth in Holly and Alexa, the two central characters of the book.  Taking a book away from a student because you don't approve of the behavior in the book doesn't solve anything.  Pretending social problems don't exist doesn't make them go away.  Instead the teacher should have checked to see what her student was getting out of the book, because while both girls participate in some pretty stupid and irresponsible behavior, the focus should be on their growth.  By the final chapter in \\"South Beach\\" the reader will recognize the changes that have taken place within each girl.  However, before Holly and Alexa can become well-balanced, happy teenagers they must learn responsibility and lessons the way most people do, through their mistakes.<br /><br />Bottom line, \\"South Beach\\" is a fun and quick read and I would definitely recommend it for fans of the \\"Gossip Girl\\" genre.ity and lessons the way most people do, through their mistakes. <br /> <br />Bottom line, \\"South Beach\\" is a fun and quick read and I would definitely recommend it for fans of the \\"Gossip Girl\\" genre.	2005-06-04
US	30412978	RNMM82EGJQ62O	0061095435	573247179	Flower Net	Books	3	40	42	N	N	Unique Thriller	It took me FOREVER to get into Lisa See's book \\"Flower Net\\".  It seems like the book just sat on my nightstand for 3 weeks with the bookmark protruding from the creases of Chapter One.  And then when I actually made an effort to read the book, it was finished in a day.<br /><br />Lisa See has succeeded in creating a unique and gripping thriller.  When the son of a American Ambassador and the son of one of Beijing's political elite both turn up dead under mysterious circumstances, U.S. Attorney David Stark is reunited with an old flame, Liu Hulan, to solve the case.  Following leads, the case unravels a trail of clues from China to the United States, leaving David and Hulan to find the connection.<br /><br />Lisa See has developed a very intriguing read, especially to people interested in Chinese culture.  I did struggle in a few parts, making me wish that I had more solid knowledge of Chinese History.  It was a relief for me at the end of \\"Flower Net\\" when I discovered that most of my confusion (in reference to historical facts) had been resolved.  I found See's inclusion of Chinese Herbal Medicine to be especially interesting.  I do agree with some of the reviewers that some of the plot twists seemed very forced or convenient (and yet somehow you could still see them coming a mile away).<br /><br />My least favorite part about this book are the characters.  It seemes to me that the background characters in \\"Flower Net\\" were more interesting and appealing than David Stark and Liu Hulan were.  In fact, I found both the main characters to be dreadfully dull and pretty one-dimensional.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a quick weekend read for fans of thrillers and especially to anyone interested in Chinese history and culture.  Aside from that, I think it might make an interesting movie, and I enjoyed \\"Flower Net\\" enough to convince myself to check out the sequel.<br /><br />Hope this helps! :)	2004-11-13

I always feel as if I will be missing something by reading the script rather than seeing it performed. After reading David Henry Hwang's &quot;Golden Child&quot;, however, I am hoping that I will one have the opportunity to see this play in person.<br /><br /> Hwang mentions in the introduction that &quot;Golden Child&quot; underwent several rewrites until the final draft was completed. The end product, to me, is utterly flawless. A perfect mesh of comedy and tragedy unfolds as Hwang confronts the effects a man's conversion to Christianity has in early 20th century China.<br /><br /> A very captivating read, I highly recommend David Henry Hwang's &quot;Golden Child&quot;.	2004-08-05

For instance, the characters remain nameless/faceless throughout the entire book. I understand Otsuka's reasoning for using this technique. It didn't matter if they were Americans, it didn't matter if they had been in this country for GENERATIONS, Japanese -- American or not -- were labeled the enemy, traitors, a threat. Not individuals, but a faceless, nameless group of \\"traitors\\". But, for me, the lack of identity made it impossible to have any sort of understanding of the characters.<br /><br /> The story itself is gripping. I enjoyed how Otsuka alternated between the different perspectives of the mother, the daughter, the son, the children together, and the father in each of the five chapters. It is through these viewpoints that the story is revealed in dreamlike sequences. The narrators, however, are essentially the same person and speak with the same voice. I would have expected there to be more distinction in voice and focus amongst the different characters.<br /><br /> Overall \\"When the Emperor was Divine\\" is a visual tour, Otsuka lays the descriptions on thick, but I didn't feel any real emotion while reading or observe any real depth. The whole book reads like an extensive creative writing assignment on sight. With such an emotional topic, I feel like Otsuka just barely scratched the surface.<br /><br /> On a more positive note, \\"When the Emperor Was Divine\\" can be read in one sitting and, while not exactly my flavor, Otsuka takes an interesting approach to her writing. I will be keeping an eye out for her future works. However, if you're looking for an in-depth account of the Japanese internment camps [prisons] you might want to check elsewhere first.	2004-07-31

While overall I enjoyed this book, I can't help but feel that the topic of teenagers and drugs has been done to death. \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" opens with the narrator Eric retelling the story of his murder. The reader witnesses as Eric relives his struggles to break free from his conforming to society standards and to present himself as an individual. In order to achieve this goal, he gives into his friend Tom's hoodlum wannabe antics. While Tom procliams himself as being a non-conformist, he reveals that he is easily swayed by other people's opinions and ideals.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book is that I couldn't quite grasp the point that Michael Scott Moore was attempting to present to the reader. Non-conformism is a dangerous thing? Because attempting to be an individual turns Tom's life into shambles and the second Eric steps away from his moral ideals, it gets him killed. And I promise that wasn't a spoiler, you know from the beginning that he dies :) Furthermore, the ending was too open and rushed for my tastes. And for as short as this novel is, I think Moore tried to tackle too many social issues and jam in too many pop culture references. It was overkill. In conclusion, while \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" was a quick and intriguing read, I would in no way consider it life-altering or flawless.	2004-07-29

While, at times, Blumenthal's characters give you a neurosis of your very own from their constant worry, &quot;What's Wrong with Dorfman?&quot; is a hilarious and entertaining read. Blumenthal's writing is witty and fresh and his characters are enthralling. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	2004-07-29

Diagnosed with diabetes at the age of six, Lucy has grown up feeling like outsider.  She seperates herself from her peers (deeming herself a freak) and she even visualizes herself as a vampire of sorts.<br />First, let me admit that I did not find Lucy to be a likeable character.  She is very self-centered and acts as if she is the only person with medical problems.  In fact, there is even another girl with diabetes in the book and all Lucy does is make fun of her and scoff at her chipper attitude.  Lucy is negative, she contradicts herself, she believes herself to be better than everybody else.<br />And yet, while she isn't a likeable character, I find Lucy to be a very believable one.  Hautman does an excellent job allowing the reader to see the inner workings of Lucy's mind and allowing for the reader to witness Lucy as she struggles to come to terms with her disease.<br />\\"Sweetblood\\" is a great insight to diabetes, with a modern twist including Goth subculture.  Granted, readers expecting your cookie cutter vampire novel might be a little bit disappointed.  However I find \\"Sweetblood\\" to be a Funny, eye-opening, and inspiring read that should not be missed.	2004-07-03

So when I first started reading \\"Ostrich Eye\\" I had no clue what I was in for.  Here's the lowdown:  Ginger lives at home with her mother, stepfather and half-sister Vivian.  Having never met her real father and always having to witness the way her mother and stepfather dote on Vivian, Ginger begins to feel out of place, slightly overshadowed.  So when a mysterious stranger appears in town, she begins making connections between him and her real father.  Is this man the long lost father Ginger thinks he is?  Or is Ginger blind to the stranger's true intentions?<br />The characters in \\"Ostrich Eye\\" are interesting and well-developed.  Cooley manages to give her characters voices that seem honest, seem to ring true.  While I found the plot to be slightly predictable, the story is fast-paced and flows smoothly.  Overall, I find \\"Ostrich Eye\\" to be an enjoyable, quick read that gives its readers a heads up on an serious crisis that affects many families.  I will definitely keep an eye out for more works by Beth Cooley in the future.	2004-07-02

(and I don't mean give it a name)	At first, I was dreading that I would have a difficult time finsihing \\"Name Me Nobody\\" since the pidgin English greatly slowed my reading and I had to backtrack several times to clarify that I had read everything correctly.  However, once I made it through a couple of chapters, I was able to adapt to the word flow and the book became much easier to read.  Luckily, I didn't have any problem with the Japanese vocabulary since I'm studying Japanese, but a glossary in the back would definitely help those who are unfamiliar with the language.  With all that said, I feel the pidgin English and Japanese are essential to \\"Name Me Nobody\\" because they help to give the characters an authentic voice.  So what else can I say?  I really enjoyed this book.  While under the surface, \\"Name Me Nobody\\" is your standard coming of age story, Yamanaka puts a twist on it and creates a books with an addictive story and memorable characters.  ALL of the characters have flaws which, for me, makes them much more beleivable.  For example, when the reader is first introduced to Emmy-lou, she is an overweight, self-conscious mess.  She blames every rejection she encounters on her weight problem.  After her best friend, Yvonne or \\"Von\\", helps her to lose the weight, however, Emmy-lou is STILL a self-conscious mess and she still puts the blame on everything/everybody but herself.  While this allows for the reader to not always be fond of Emmy-lou, this portrayal strikes me as being very realistic.  Yamanaka allows for the reader to witness Emmy-lou as she learns to come to terms with and to accept herself.  Aside from the great character development,  the plot of \\"Name Me Nobody\\" is  very engrossing.  It kept me guessing as to what was in store next for Emmy-lou and I stayed up until 4 a.m. finishing this book.  The lack of sleep was well worth it though, even if I was exhausted at work the follow day :)  In conclusion, I highly recommend Lois-Ann Yamanaka's book \\"Name Me Nobody\\" and I will definitely be reading more of her books in the future.itely be reading more of her books in the future.	2004-06-29

The problem with killing your main character off in the first chapter is that it usually doesn't leave room for much of a climax in the end.  I wanted to like this book, it's a great concept!  The first chapter is very gripping, however, I just wasn't impressed with anything that followed.  While the book is short, it seems repetitive and boring.  Furthermore, the characters are very distant and unconvincing.  While the entire book is spent following Chuy's ghost and listening to his thoughts and feelings, I never get a feeling of who he really is/was.  Another downfall of this book is all the Spanish words thrown into it.  Luckily there is a glossary included in the back, but since I *had* to know the meaning of every Spanish word I came across, I was constantly flipping to the back of the book.  While it's interesting to study languages and cultures, I don't really think the words added anything to the book and they slowed down the flow of the story.	2004-06-16

In America, we have so many cultures living side by side, it's important for us to attempt to understand one another.  Dori Jones Yang successfully creates a book that is enjoyable, educational, and inspiring.  I feel many people will enjoy this book because they can relate to, in one way or another, the main character Jinna.  After moving to Seattle from China, Jinna (Gina as she is dubbed in English), finds herself unable to communicate in school.  Not only can she not understand and speak English, but she finds herself unable to speak AT ALL.  Soon after, Gina is befriended by another class outcast, Priscilla, and both children are able to overcome their anxieties and issues with the help of each other's friendship.  This is an excellent, inspiring book.  I hope to read more books by Dori Jones Yang in the future.	2004-06-16

The story revolves around Sophie, a pregnant teenager, whose past is a mystery even to herself and whose unborn child she is carrying is a secret she keeps to herself.  Sweeney develops the story in such a way that it keeps the reader guessing and wanting to know all of the characters' secrets.  Furthermore, the characters themselves are very human, very believable.  This book was a short, yet intriguing, page-turner and I am definitely looking forward to reading more books by Joyce Sweeney.	2004-06-16

I have read the reviews of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" both positive and negative.  I agree with both sides to an extent.  \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" IS a dated novel.  And while dialogue at times seems straight from \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" (Gee whiz!) and the ending can be deemed corny, I feel that this book and Ray Bradbury have stood and will continue to stand the test of time.<br /><br />Bradbury's style of writing may not be appreciated by everyone, but to say that his work is a waste of time seems way to extreme to me.  I love Bradbury's works FOR the metaphors, FOR his long descriptions.  Bradbury does not allow his readers to be innocent bystanders, instead he places them right there standing next to Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, witnessing firsthand the evil that is Dark and Cooger's traveling carnival.  It is a perfect combination of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.  For this, Ray Bradbury is definitely one of a kind.<br /><br />As for the ending, I was happy to read a novel with such a simple message at the end.  There was no big complex (often ridiculously impossible) solution to ridding the town of evil, rather a pure, simple fix.  For me, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a welcomed stray from modern horror fiction.	2003-10-11

You tell them it's edgy, they love it.\\"<br />So writes Judy Blume on the first page of Summer Sisters.  This quote is the only explanation I can think of for all the high ratings that this book has received.<br />\\"Summer Sisters\\" I assume, is Blume's attempt at being edgy.  We are introduced to a meek girl Victoria who is selected by the school's miss popularity Caitlin to jet away to Martha's Vineyard for the summer.  It soon becomes a yearly ritual.  They spend their summers lusting over brain dead beau hunks and experimenting with their \\"powers\\" (sexuality for those who have passed the 6th grade sex ed class).<br />Was this book edgy?  No.  Was it attempting to be edgy?  I think so.  I can only assume that people who like this book haven't taken the sex ed. class yet.<br />Aside from the obvious.  Blume's writing style is extremely simplistic and is better suited for the young adult novels that are her claim to fame.  Furthermore, there is a serious lack of development and growth in both plot and characters in \\"Summer Sisters\\".  The characters remain distant and shallow throughout the entire novel and the plot just kind of drags on.  As a reader I did not become attach to any of the characters nor did I even care about their outcome.<br />The only positive thing I have to say about \\"Summer Sisters\\" is that it is an exceptionally quick read, that is, if you don't decide to give up on it altogether.	2003-10-11

The story is very moving and, while I normally have a hard time following play scripts, Gotanda's use of imagery really allows for the reader to visualize the performance every step of the way.  Each detail to the description of the scenes and the actions of the characters drew me further and further into the story.  I would love to see a performance of this play!  Someone please bring it to Michigan :)	2003-09-04

So, over a decade and a half later, when I heard the buzz about \\"Holes\\" I decided to check it out for myself.<br />I absolutely LOVED this book, mind you, I am also 25 years old.  I personally feel that this book will be more appreciated by an older audience, and by people familiar with Sachar's style of writing.  While I was outright laughing in parts, I do not necessarily think a younger reader will pick up on the subliminal humor and irony.<br />Furthermore, the book alternates between the narrating of two different stories, which ultimately DO intercept.  However, some people might find it difficult to follow the two stories which don't really seem to have any connection in the beginning of the book.  I can see where this book might confuse younger readers.<br />It is best to read this book understanding that Sachar's stories (from my experience) are always over-the-top and may even seem silly.  I believe that this is the reason his books agreed with me so well as a child.  However, if you are looking for a book with a linear plot and morally outstanding characters, and a book that has to make sense 100% of the time, then \\"Holes\\" is not the book you are looking for.<br /><br />A fair warning to parents, \\"Holes\\" is quite a graphic book.  There are a number of violent characters and some graphic depictions, however, I did not find any of these instances to be any more graphic then your run of the mill modern day Disney movie.  These instances are beyond slapstick and often even fall into the violent/abusive category.  In all fairness to \\"Holes\\", however, the setting for the story is Camp Green Lake, a correctional camp for juvenile delinquents.  You can't exactly expect fuzzy bunnies and bonding sessions where the characters sit around and talk about their problems in a calm and rational manner.  My suggestion is that you read the book yourself first and then decide if you want your child to read it (this is just a suggestion after reading some of the other, less favorable reviews).<br />I hold firm, however, that \\"Holes\\" is a great book that can be appreciated by a good number of people.  Sachar delivers a great story, illustrates some important morals (while not all \\"in your face\\") and still manages to create a happy ending.  This book left a smile on my face.<br />*The movie was well done too :) And my 29 year older sister also raves about this book.suggestion is that you read the book yourself first and then decide if you want your child to read it (this is just a suggestion after reading some of the other, less favorable reviews).<br />I hold firm, however, that \\"Holes\\" is a great book that can be appreciated by a good number of people.

This is the manga that's got me hooked right now and I am anxiously waiting for book 5.  Not only for fashion buffs, this series has everything that good shoujo manga should have.<br />Beginning with overall appearance, everything is beautifully drawn and the emphasis on fashion is a great addition.  I am always excited to see what outfits Miwako and the others will be wearing next.<br />The characters have such depth to them.  Yazawa has carefully created a past for each character and she introduces each past piece by piece.  Each little addition adds a clue to the mindset of each character and helps the reader understand why the characters act the way they do.  The characters seem human, they act realistically and naturally.<br />As for plot.  Well, it is shoujo manga so there are many of the typical struggles going on in \\"Paradise Kiss\\".  A girl fed up with her studies is searching for any means of escape.  She gets caught up with a group of outcasts, struggles to find herself, and even manages to fall in love (borderline love triangle for sure)  ::SURPRISE!!!::  However, I personally feel that while the typical themes are always lying beneath the surface, \\"Paradise Kiss\\" delivers them in a fun and original way.<br />So if your looking for a manga with a great plot, intriguing/lovable characters, alot of humor and great artwork, I would highly recommend \\"Paradise Kiss\\".  I have already gotten the 3 friends I introduced it to completely hooked =D	2003-09-03

The legend of the Vampires is one that has fascinated humans for centuries.  It is nearly impossible for a writer to delve into the territory of vampires and make their work 100% original.  If they did, they would destroy the legend altogether.<br />Annette Curtis Klause's \\"The Silver Kiss\\", while regurgitating yet another story of bad boy Vampires, inter-species (?) love, inner torment, and revenge is still a great read.  This book was not boring at all, rather it grabbed my attention and held me there.  Klause's style of writing is very poetic and mesmerizing.  The story achieves an aura of darkness that is not always mastered in young adult novels.  Granted, the plot is one we had all heard before, but I read \\"The Silver Kiss\\" as if I was hearing the story for the first time.  That, to me, is the mark of a great author.	2003-09-02

The plot of this book is very moving and Ailin is a strong and likeable character.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese culture.	2003-08-26

I was one of the dorks waiting at midnight to receive my copy of \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".  And I began reading it that very night...and it took me forever to get through it.  For some reason, this particular installment of the Harry Potter series did not draw me in.  It just didn't seem as magical as the first four installments and I found myself hating the characters.  Harry spends most of the book whining, and it got so bad I began hoping that Harry was the character that Rowling decided to kill off.  All the hype over the character who dies was the only thing that kept me interested.  But then I was SO disappointed when I finally got to the \\"infamous\\" death scene.  I could have cared less about the person who died (I won't give spoilers)...by that time I was just happy I had finally finished the book.  I am not saying that this book was completely horrible.  I just feel that this was my least favorite of the Harry Potter series.  It lacked the character depth, awe-inspiring, nail biting plot, and humor of the previous installments.  It does have a pretty blue cover though (haha)	2003-08-26
US	30412978	RRLHK3UY3EVHW	0140387919	202826760	Tell Me Everything	Books	2	1	3	N	N	ZzzzZZzz...	I personally feel that this book is exceptionally boring and has a very weak plot.  I assume that the underlying theme of the book was to illustrate how the main character, Roz, copes and comes to terms with her mother's untimely death.  While Roz is a complex character, I did not feel that most of her actions were rational or plausible.  No matter how hard I tried, I just could not relate to Roz or even understand her actions/reactions.  This is an extremely short book, however, I still had difficulty reading it without falling asleep.  After I finished \\"Tell Me Everything\\" I was just happy that I was done.	2003-08-22

Knowing that it was Napoli's take on the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale I was really excited to read this book.  And, don't get me wrong, \\"The Magic Circle\\" started off great.  Napoli is an amazingly talented author, however, I couldn't help but feel that \\"The Magic Circle\\" was lacking towards the end of the book.  As soon as Hansel and Gretel were introduced into the book, I felt that Napoli was in a rush all the way to the ending.  I did not really get a good insight into the caracters of Hansel and Gretel and their relationship with the Witch.  In the end, I was just disappointed that a book that started off so amazing could be such a let down.  I have not read all of Napoli's books yet, and the neutral feeling for \\"The Magic Circle\\" will not prevent me from doing so.  However, I prefer \\"Crazy Jack\\" over this particular Napoli work.	2003-08-22

And I admit, I was drawn to this book because her age.  I wanted to see exactly how a 13 year old would go about tackling the immensely overdone topic of vampires.  Instead of writing about vampires, though, she ended up inventing her own species entirely.  For the most part, that would be alright.  I mean, what is the point of writing fiction if you can't create everything the way YOU want it to be.  In this instance, however, Atwater-Rhodes' take on vampires strikes me as a sad attempt to make her book new and original.  What the reader is given instead is a story lacking in character development and plot.  Many words used in the book and themes are very redundant, which is unforgivable considering the book's extremely short length.  I honestly feel that Atwater-Rhodes was only published BECAUSE of her age, since this book is seriously lacking in originality and depth.  I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 in hopes that she has improved with her other books and will continue to do so.  However, if you want to read a book written by a teenager, check out S.E. Hinton's \\"The Outsiders\\".	2003-08-21
