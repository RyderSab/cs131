However, that could be because the book is written in the first person, so we never get to really know True.  But we get to know and like Collie, and the book has it's amusing moments.

It's not romantic (Claire & Adrian love each other right away and after that the book focuses mostly on the \\"suspense\\" part of the plot), it's not suspenseful (we know who the murderer is from the start) and furthermore, it's not even interesting.  What it is instead, is REDUNDANT.  Not one but TWO different people try to frame Adrian for murder and of course, Claire manages to get taken hostage by both bad guys, and so needs to be rescued not once, but twice.  This book is boring, boring, boring.  I had to skim the last third, I just couldn't slog through to the very end.  Too bad I paid full price for it.	2002-03-13

On the one hand, it's well-written, well plotted and well researched.  On the other hand, reading it was a terribly vexing experience for me. If you like alpha heros who treat the heroine like dirt throughout the entire book and then she falls in love with him anyway, this is the book for you. I am not one of those who enjoy that type of story. The author really gives you a feel for the time period, although it's too heavy on the political maneuvers of the time (especially near the end).  In spite of heaviness of the uninteresting political part of the plot, this would have been a wonderful read for me, except I kept rooting for the heroine to go join a convent than stay with her complete jerk of a husband.	2002-01-30

She just needs to stay the heck away from suspense plots.  There are so many holes in this plot, some stuff didn't even make sense from a logical point of view.  This author should in the future, stay away from writing about gangs, undercover agents, courtrooms, trials or the FBI. She obviously has no idea how these entities might actually function.  Also:  I have to mention that anyone who would drive along aimlessly on deserted Montana back roads, at night, trying to think up a new business proposal without enough gas in her tank and who doesn't even notice when her &quot;gas&quot; light turns on is not only a complete nitwit, but she is one SERIOUSLY distracted driver and is a danger to others.

It's supposed to be part mystery, part comedy and part romance.  It fails on all three levels.  Even at the end, when the villan is revealed, he seems tacked on, how he could have known about certain events is unexplained, three people are dead and I'm still not sure who killed them.  It fails as a comedy, not even the dog character is amusing.  It fails as a romance because it reads like a diatribe on &quot;marriage as a trap for the unwary&quot; as well as because the reader gets no sense of why Nell loves Gabe or why Gabe loves Nell.  Gabe is a complete cardboard character.  The only things we know about him are that he is tall, dark-haired,in his 40's and resistent to change.  That is not a fleshed-out character.  I agree with the author 100% that getting married should be more difficult (too many get married without enough forethought) but writing a book about how awful marriage can be and marketing it as a romance is a bad idea.  At the end of the book I got the feeling that Nell and Gabe would be divorced in 5 years, maximum.   The author can tell a story beautifully, she just needs to tell better stories.  Who needs help being depressed?  And she should get her characters the heck out of Ohio.  Obviously, it is a hotbed of sordid and adulterous activity.	2001-05-11

Not only is he constantly insulting Olivia, but he actually sneaks into her room, rifles through her belongings and reads her journal.  INEXCUSABLE.  And Olivia actually refers to him as &quot;charming&quot;.  If someone had so little respect for me that they would invade my privacy in such a manner, I would be hard pressed not to assault them physically.  Anyone who finds Neville &quot;adorable&quot; has a screw loose.  He doesn't strike me as particularly vulnerable, he comes across as insufferably cocky.  If I was Olivia, I would sell my childhood home and move as far away from him as I could get.  What a jerk.  His wartime experiences (which we learn about on the LAST PAGE of the book) do not excuse his annoying, insulting, disrespectful and UNheroic behavior.  This book can be summed up in a four letter work:  YUCK	2001-05-08

And I have read a lot of books.  I've never been so annoyed while reading a book.  Supposedly a pleasurable activity.  I was actually rooting for Tibbie to go back with the former lover who impregnated and abandoned her.  She'd be better off with him than with Nick.  What a clod.  All he had to say was &quot;I love you, will you marry me?&quot; and the book would have ended at the halfway point. BUT NO.  She had to tell him she loved him, FIRST.  Why is he so insistent?  When he knows all she's been through before with her former lover?  It doesn't make any sense except that the author had no plot.  If you read this book you will be wasting your time and money.  I simply can't say enough bad things about it, as I don't have my thesaurus handy.	2001-04-26

Roarke is an arrogant, presumptuous jerk and would be an OK hero if someone would take him down a peg.  Eve is not the one to do it, as every time she says something, he overrules her (even in her choice of beverages) and she lets him do it.  This would be OK, if that is the way her character was written.  Instead, the author claims she is a strong-willed, independent professional woman who knows her own mind.  THEN WHY DOESN'T SHE ACT LIKE IT?  Why does she keep letting Rourke overrule her?  Even in simple matters like eating dinner or what to drink (he does this, twice with the beverages).   The author should either have Eve be a woman who likes to be submissive and not care about her career or stop having her actions so out of character.  She sleeps with a suspect in a murder investigation (sounds like something my self-destructive sister would do) and then lies to her police chief by claiming he's been taken off the list of suspects.  HELLO?  Can we say incredibly unprofessional, risky, and not to mention, STUPID?  She'd only known the man a week.  The only thing that gets this book it's two star rating from me is the author's interesting vision of the future and flow of writing.  Otherwise, she needs to choose different attributes for Eve.  They don't mesh with her behavior.  Very annoying to read.	2001-04-26
US	52689256	R19ZEEJQPUR2B9	0312870000	66936687	A Mortal Bane	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good Book	No one can bring you into a time period better than Roberta Gellis.  It's also very interesting that the people she writes about are average folks, so the reader gets a feel for daily life of the time period.  Interesting characters and a good old-fashioned murder mystery make this good reading.  The only reason this book didn't get 5 stars is Gellis sometimes gets a tad bogged down in speculative conversations about politics of the time.  It's hard to follow, with the people being discussed not actual characters in the book, they just are spoken of.  Sometimes referred to by their names, sometimes by their titles.  Gellis obviously finds the minutia of the politics of the time fascinating, but for the average reader with only basic background knowledge, it can be just plain confusing.  Fortunately, she only falls into this trap 3 times and soon enough we get back to Magdelene and her would-be lover Bell.  I can't wait for the next book in the series to find out what happens between them next.	2001-04-13

However, the hero, Fitzwilliam, remains seriously out of touch with himself right up until the last chapter and it gets old quickly.  Is he  man, thirty years of age who knows his own mind, or is he a six year old who only wants a toy because someone else is playing with it?  Most of the book he is relieved that Addie is going to marry someone else, but his actions are contrary to that emotion.  He is wondering what on Earth he is doing, and so is Addie, and the reader is just annoyed by his indecisiveness.  This is hardly romantic.   Ms. Benson tries just a tad too hard to be amusing with some of the secondary characters, but it falls flat.  Also:  I have to wonder just how Addie could possibly have gained so much boxing knowledge, enough to write a newspaper column about it, being a female member of the gentry in regency England.  Supposedly her father was a fan of the sport, but he hardly would have taken her to any bouts.  Her knowledge of boxing (every time it was frequently mentioned) pulled me right out of the story because it was so unlikely (not to mention, practically impossible)  for the time period.  Ms. Benson's first book was much better.	2001-04-13

First off, I simply cannot buy into a conquering Norman soldier in 1066 refusing to consumate his marriage and secure his right to the land until the lady &quot;cares&quot; for him.  Silly beyond belief.  Then, the mystery part of the plot has a HUGE, gaping hole.  Supposedly the murderer of her first husband is the owner of a pin found at the site house of a dead prostitute.  Well it never occurs to Faithe that prostitutes are visited by large numbers of men, and that pin could have been dropped by anyone days earlier.  Why suppose the murderer dropped it?  Is there blood on it or something?  No.  All Alex had to do to cover up Luke's murder was to say:  &quot;Hey, that's my pin.  Sure, I visited that prostitute.  So did half the Norman army.  But that doesn't mean I killed her.&quot;   The pin is not proof and means nothing and Faithe never even thinks of that possiblity.  Instead, she is running around England in 1066 looking for the owner of the pin.  Nonsense from start to finish.  Ryan has written better books.  Try any of those instead of this drivel.	2001-04-02

The central character in RUTHLESS CHARMER is Claudia, and she is capricious, petulant, irrational, dishonest, spoiled, and annoying in the extreme. I kept rooting for Julian to dump her and look for someone else.  How is that for romantic?  Claudia can't seem to have a honest conversation with anyone, and repeatedly jumps to stupid conclusions about Julian that go against everything she knows about him.  UGH. There are FOUR &quot;big misunderstandings&quot; in this book, a lame plot device that substitutes for a real plot.   Rarely have I ever disliked a main character more.  The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the high quality of writing.  This author just needs to come up with a better conflict to further the plot, rather than resorting to turning the main character into a lunatic who doesn't behave rationally.  It is a complete mystery at the end of the book when Julian proclaims his love for her.  The reader is left wondering why on earth he would want to have anything further to do with her.  I know I wouldn't.	2000-10-24

This book is allforeplay, hardly any romance, character development or actualintercourse.  And the last few pages of the book when the heroine is becoming sexually aroused as the hero describes to her the awful abuse he suffered as a child is positively revolting.  The hero needs some serious mental health counseling but by the time we finally figure out what his dire mutterings throughout the book are about, it's too late. Last chapter of the book character revalations don't let you come to understand or care for the character.  Also, the heroine of this book seems to be a clone of Abby from Schone's last short story.  Right down to the color of their hair with grey in it both of them spinsters desperate for sexual touching.  No one can write a sex scene like Schone, but hopefully she will soon move on to other plotlines than &quot;man as sexual tutor&quot; because it's getting old.
