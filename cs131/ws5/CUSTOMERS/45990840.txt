This book is well worth its 15 ounces. It takes you through the ruins with multiple maps and illustrations. It explains what we do and don't know about the functions of the buildings and terraces. The book is organized by areas. When you reach a certain section of the ruins, you can turn to that section for pictures, descriptions and suggestions on how to walk through the area.     The section on water management illustrates the brilliance of the Inca engineers.The section on the climb up Huayna Picchu, is detailed and makes the climb less daunting. The description also give appropriate cautions about climbing there in slippery weather.     On several pages, there are photographs of the ruins next to artist's renditions of what the buildings might have looked like when they were in use in the 1500s.	2005-03-05

For Peru, with its diversity of places and wildlife I got several. However if I really had to pick my favorite for Peru, I would chose Lonely Planet. The city maps are fairly good for the larger, more visited areas. The sections on history and culture are interesting and insightful without being too lengthy.  <br /> <br />I particularly liked the section on health issues. This guidebook did a better job with altitude sickness, and some of the jungle diseases than any of the other guidebooks I have read. To my chagrim, I read that the two most commonly used medications for altitude sickness were contraindicated for me. I found out that I would have to plan well before my trip so that I could get all of the the proper immunizations for the jungle part of our trip. Based on the book, I decided to get a travel medicine consult--a very good move that probably saved me a lot of potential problems.  <br /> <br />The sections on social customs and conveniences were helpful. You wouldn't buy a guidebook just because it has a section explaining Peruvain toilets and toilet paper, but things like this are really really useful if you are traveling with kids.  <br /> <br />The climate charts for different sections of Peru only occupy a page or two, but are actually quite helpful in planning vacation dates.  <br /> <br />I would have liked for the guide to include more information on the beautiful and remote Manu National Park. I had to buy another book and go on the Internet to get much information on that area.	2005-03-05

The author presents practical information that will help parents in their day to day struggle to deal with the changing world of an adolescent with ADHD. She clearly has dealt with some of these stiuations herself, so she brings humorous and compassionate anecdotes to illustrate the factual material.

The adolescent was unimpressed. She said that the pages were distracting and there was too much on each page. The younger child, age 9, said that he liked the book. However, the things he read didn't stick. He liked the pictures but the ideas did not draw him in enough to make him want to practice what he read. In all fairness, though the 9 year old is the type of kid who likes an idea better if he has more of a \\"why\\" explanation.  <br /> <br />I would have liked the book better if there were only one idea per page spread. If you have two different technquies on the same page spread, the child may move on to the next idea without fully exploring and digesting a particular suggestion. It takes some discipline to practice some of these relaxation and self control techniques.  <br /> <br />The pages were bright and the pictures sharp. The pages were held together by a few staples, not a conventional book binding. A better quality binding would help so that the book could lie flat while the child used it.  <br /> <br />Despite these criticisms, I think that the book has some value. Children can benefit from learning relaxation and self-monitoring techniques. For children who have a limited repetoire of coping skills, this provides a number of different avenues to try. The book might be more effective if an adult worked through the exercises with the child.	2005-02-12

I bought this book as a birthday present for my husband, a former chemist and sometimes gourmet cook. He had enjoyed the original version of this book and also liked the Curious Cook. I heard that the revised edition was significantly updated, so I got it for him right away. I figured that he would periodically read chapters on his own. Here is what surprised me: It has become the bedtime story book for our almost 10 year old son. I knew that my husband would like it, so I excitedly showed it to my youngest son. He perusing it himself. Of course he did not understand much of it without lengthy explanations. So my husband started to read it to him, explaining the obscure parts. I thought that my son would get bored after a couple of nights of this, but they have been at it for quite a while and my son has not asked to switch books.<br /><br />The author covers a wide variety of types of foods and food issues. It starts with seections based on food types. Milk and milk products are the first. Once you read about the chemical, physical and aesthetic properties of a food, you want to go out and try the foods or food combinations yourself.<br /><br />The revised edition is significantly different from the original. If you are the type of person who likes the science behind food, you will probably also be the type who cares whether your information is up to date.  If you are more of a chemistry dilettante like me, you will appreciate the interesting writing style and the relevance to current cooking and nutrition issues. If you are a science-oriented 10 year old, you will enjoy telling your classmates and teachers lurid details about what they are currently chewing. Since you can cloak these lurid details in legitimate basic science, the teachers generally have to let you keep talking.<br /><br />This book explains the \\"why\\" of the way ingredients mix together to make a tasty or unpalatable food. While this is not a recipe cookbook, the author does provide valuable information on how to choose and store foods to ensure the best quality. Understanding the basic principles of food chemistry enables a cook to improvise and sometimes sustitute ingredients. It explains how the different constitutents of milk influence the milk's properties. This in turn helps explain how we arrive at different properties of cheeses. the author takes you from the overall look of the food down to the molecular level.<br /><br />The book helps one understand food safety and spoilage. Advances in our understanding of food safety are reflected in this book.<br /><br />In sum, I recommend this book for erudite cooks and chemists, as well as diletanttes (like me) who want to know more about selected foods. I would not recommend this as bedtime reading for most 10 year olds, but for a certain subset--the type of kid who is always asking \\"why\\" it might be a good source of answers.<br /><br />(And yes, I read him regular books when it is my turn to do bedtime stories.)e and store foods to ensure the best quality.

This book covers the topic from many angles. Why should you get testing? Who does testing? How do you pay for it? What do you do with it once you have it? <br /> <br />This is probably not your spring break beach book. The book packs a lot of detailed information that could be useful for parents and health professionals. The authors use many brief vignettes to illustrate the information. However, it may be too dense and comprehensive for some individuals. If you don't want to read it straight through, you could use it as a reference book to look up information on particular tests or diagnoses. Schools might do well to purchase this book for use by some of their staff.  <br /> <br />The book is organized by diagnosis (such as Dyslexia, AD/HD, Autism) and by types of psychological tests (such as intelligence tests, achievement tests and projective tests.) I particularly liked the section on starting the process of psychological testing. This type of testing is very expensive and it is often difficult to get schools or private insruance to pay for it. There was practical information on funding for tests and the pros and cons of getting expensive private testing or free public school testing. Since many parents are going to be using the testing to try to get special education services, the authors give an overview of the special education hearing procedures. A lot of abbreviations are used here, so read carefully. <br /> <br />In each section on diagnoses, the authors talk about sharing information with the child or adolescent. They discuss practical ways that one might use the test results to guide the child's education and treatment. They attempt to be practical. I would have liked to hear more about the role of psychological testing when an adolescent is trying to get special accomodations on tests like the SAT.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent discussion of a complex topic. Parents who read it will have an easier time advocating for their children in school placement meetings. they may also find it easier to see the child in the scales and numbers.	2005-02-05

I wish that I had had it when I was a child, enraptured by my first microscope. The book uses clear directions, specific lists of materials needed, accessible drawings and actual photographs.  <br /> <br />The first section, Lights, Lenses & Microscopes, explains the priciples of how a microscope works and why. It also covers how to measure and how to keep a journal of your findings. I wish that kids would read this section, but many may skip directly to the experiments in the next several sections. The book also has some safety tips, but parents should read those parts with the child so that they make sure that these are not skipped.  <br /> <br />The biology section shows ways to view plants, fish scales and other items. I liked the section on how to build your own microtome using a wooden spool, a carrot and a screw. The geology section is shorter but has some good ideas about looking at crystals. There are also short sections on forensics and fibers. The section on food and the environment include fun activities using mould, yeast and mushrooms.  <br /> <br />Each activitiy description is short enough to keep an older elementary-younger middle school kid entertained. The author puts in educational snippets that enlighten but do not overburden the young reader.  <br /> <br />This book is a fun introduction to the microscope that will encourage kids to explore more.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

The treatments make the mother's hair fall out and give her a huge appetite. Worse still, the treatment makes her tired and irritable. Tabitha misses their warm tickle games. Tabitha, her brother and even the cat get frightened when their mother gets angry. When their father sees this, he uses love and humor to help provide support. Tabitha finds a way to get her mother to show her old warmth.  <br /> <br />The superb illustrations are warm and expressive. When the picture shows the shadow of the angry mother, wig askew, standing over Tabitha, one really gets the sense of how Tabitha experiences her mother just then. <br /> <br />Mood changes are more difficult for children to understand than the more concrete aspects of an illness. This book does an excellent job of showing how these mood The story is realistic without being scarey. This book would be good not just for children of cancer patients but also for children of parents withother chronic diseases such as Hepatitis C. A variety of illness and treatments can cause an individual to be irritable or moody.	2005-01-28

They have to decide whether to keep the money or turn the wallet in. The reader takes the role of one of the boys. The book deals not only with honesty, but with peer pressure. The boy's friend urges him to keep some of the money. There are several points along the way when the reader must make a decision. That decision determines how the story unfolds. Even after using some of the money, the reader has a chance to try to rectify his action. I liked this because children and adolescents often make impulsive mistakes and need to talk about how you dig yourself out.  <br /> <br />This book is part of the Decision is Yours series, a great group of interactive decision-making books. I would recommend this and the other books for individual children and younger adolescents as well as for schools.  <br /> <br />I can relate to this story from the point of view of the person who dropped his wallet. Twice in the past year, I misplaced my wallet and each time, someone turned it in with all the money and credit cards intact. Hooray for human decency!	2005-01-27

When she gets her report card and sees the low grades, she is worried about how her parents will react. The reader takes on the role of the girl and makes choices that will determine the subsequent events. The reader can choose to have her cheat to bring up her grades, or hide her test results. The reader can also also choose to ask a teacher for extra study help. Because the choices put the reader more in control, kids may take this book more seriously. They can also try out different choices and see what happens. Readers tend to get more satisfactory end results when they make the moral choices, but sometimes even doing the \\"right\\" thing does not make life totally perfect. I have used this book with individual children, and with groups of young adolescents who have social sklls issues.<br /><br />I wish more parents and schools bought this book. It is part of a series, The Decision is Yours, which helps elementary and middle school aged children think about their decision-making. Taken together with the other books in the series, (I have read all of them) it makes a great social skills/decision making curriculum. If a school or therapist wanted to use it this way, there is an accompanying book, Decision is Yours Leader's Guide, also available through Amazon.	2005-01-27

We need more books on this topic, especially when my favorite one, Please Don't Cry Mom, is out of print. Why Are You So Sad gives straightforward information, but the plot and illustrations seem one dimensional. I did not find myself drawn in by the characters. I had a couple of children look at it. One said that it sounded \\"accurate\\" but they did not find it interesting.  <br /> <br />Children of a depressed parent need to hear this sort of information, so I will keep the book. A parent or counselor might be better off reading the book themselves, and making up their own story based on the factual material presented in the book. Sad Days, Glad Days does not have as much factual material but has better illustrations and conveys more warmth.	2005-01-26

It starts in June, when her mother's cancer is first diagnosed. In the ensuing months, her mother experiences surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In the final month, May, her mother is feeling better and appears to be on the road to a good recovery.  <br /> <br />Each month includes Claire's experiences, hopes and fears. She discusses her daily routine and how it has to change when her mother is too ill to pack her lunch or drive her to school. Eventually, Claire learns to manage some chores, such as laundry, on her own. She feels that she is contributing and that she has learned some new skills. Each monthly chapter also includes scientific information explaining facts that a child might want to know. These topics include surgery, surgical drains, chemotherapy, and hair loss. the illustrations include drawings and photographs. They look like the marginal drawings that a girl like Claire might actually do. they help illustrate her reactions. <br /> <br />I liked the way that the book is organized around a specific time frame. A child experiences time differently from an adult. Although cancer treatment often extends longer than a year, the concrete depiction of time passage allows the child or young adolescent to see that there is a progression.  <br /> <br />The author and illustrator have both had personal experience with cancer in themselves or in their family. They make it clear that different people experience cancer in their own ways, and that different emotional reactions are all right.  <br />	2005-01-24

You can also spot books written by authors with clear professional experience. This book is both. Dr.Jensen is both a well-known reasearcher and the parent of a boy with AD/HD.  He includes deatiled practical information on a variety of topics relevant to reasing a child with AD/HD. He illustrates this with examples from his own family life as well as with the voices of many other parents. He clearly shows respect for the members of families who are dealing with AD/HD.  <br /> <br />I liked his suggestions on how to interact with health professionals in a managed care environment. He holds physicians to a high standard of care, and tells parents how to be effective and assertive when they feel that they are not getting what they need. I liked his suggestions on how to politely get your doctor to answer further questions when he is ready to end the session. I was glad that he talked about communication between members of the child's treatment team. this is often where treatment founders. He gives specifics on how a parent can encourage and monitor the communication flow beween school, physician, and other therapists.  <br /> <br />Dr. Jensen explains the role of medication and how parents can help professionals monitor progress and possible side effects. He also suggests situations when a parent might want to consider whether the medication is not being monitored closely enough. He suggests ways that parents can hlep the physician monitor medications. He explains the importance of a parent keeping records of medications and other treatments. <br /> <br />The section on home and family life is compassionate and pragmatic. He gives suggestions for behavioral plans but also puts them in a realistic perspective. He gives suggestions for what to do if a well-designed plan does not work. He discusses parent stress and burnout. Many parents have wanted practical information on how to balance play dates and a busy schedule. <br /> <br />The appendices contain items such as model letters requesting special education services. There are also recommended books and web sites for individuals who desire more information on legal rights, time managements and advocacy groups.  <br /> <br />At 283 pages, the book might be too long and too dense for some stressed, overworked parents. For those new to AD/HD a shorter book might make a more accessible introduction. However, for the parent who has the attention and time to read it, the book provides the practical wisdom of many experienced parents and the knowlege of an experienced scientist.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-22

In this story, a boy encounters a a peer who threatens him verbally and physically. The reader can create many different scenarios by choosing different actions. Once the reader chooses an action, he goes to the appropriate page. The story changes based on each decision.  Kids can see what might happen if they choose to be assertive, aggressive or submissive. Then they can go back and try it again another way. Many of us have wished that we could redo our own life decisions.   <br /> <br />I have used this book with individual children and young adolescents. I have also used it with groups. Often a child or adolescent who has been victimized has trouble thinking of different options. This book can open up possibilities. It provides realistic positive and negative consequences. The reader can see that certain actions might end you up in the principal's office. Other actions might lead to new sources of social support.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book for elementary and middle schools, to therapists, and to children who are bullied.	2005-01-21

Although leaves superficially look the same, he learns and appreciates the subtle differences between himself and each other leaf. He admires a larger leaf, Daniel. Daniel has a deeper understanding of life and death. He helps Freddie understand each of his phases of life. Finally, Daniel explains death and letting go.<br /><br />The book uses the gentle, concrete metaphor of the annual changes in leaves on a tree to help anyone appreciate the different phases of life. Each leaf leaves the tree differently: some drift down quietly, and others fiercely resist the tug of the wind. This shows how each person approaches death differently. Freddy resists until he is withered and brown, the last leaf on the branch. Finally he lets go and experiences a sense of peace.<br /><br />Although the leaves, die each year, they are part of the tree which lives on, although even it has a finite life. the book discusses the interconnecedness of life and death. however, it does not take a stand on the specifics of a life after death.<br /><br />This would help children of a wide range of ages appreciate not only death, but also the different phases of life. Each time Freddy the leaf changes with the seasons, it is puzzling but he learns its value. He sees how the tree and the leaves have purpose. this helps one see that life has purposes that may not be immediately obvious. This book is also moving for adults who may be experiencing a life transition. I recommend that anyone, of any age take this book and read it under a tree.	2005-01-17

It describes her reactions to her alcoholic father's mood swings and erratic behavior. When he is drunk and loud, she perceives him as a frightening \\"giant.\\"<br /><br />She is present when family and friends arrange a supportive confrontation. The father's family and friends each tell him how his drinking has affected them. Finally the girl tells her father how his drinking affects her. Her words along with those of the others present break down the father's denial. He is then able to realize that he needs to enter residential treatment.<br /><br />When he returns from the treatment, he is on the road to sobriety. He takes the loving yet painful step of apologizing to his daughter for his past behavior.<br /><br />This book takes a more optimistic view of a parent's drinking than does \\"I Wish Daddy Didn't Drink So Much.\\" I liked the way the book so vividly the girl's view of the frightening \\"giant\\" father. The book would be useful for children who are dealing with a parent in early recovery from drug or alcohol addiction. It would also be a good read for an alcoholic of drug addicted parent who was contemplating recovery. It would also help a recovering parent who is struggling to find the words to make amends to a child.<br /><br />I did have a concern about to depiction of the little girl in the confrontation session. Confrontations can be a powerful way of getting an addict into treatment. However, such a meeting is intense and it might not be appropriate for a small child to attend. I would not want a child to mistakenly feel that he or she has the power or responsibility to get the parent to stop drinking. Parents or professionals should read this book with the child and make sure that the child understands this point.	2005-01-16

While we are working this out, we are still faced, here and now, with very complicated, difficult children; Children who tax the energy and resources of schools and families. Faced with diagnostic ambiguity, you can end up with \\"true believers\\" on either end of the spectrum: Those who have a very broad definition of bipolar disorder, and those who feel that these difficult, emotionally labile children have other diagnoses.  <br /> <br />I liked this book because it is not political either way. The book is by a parent. She is more focused on dealing with the realities of these difficult children. This said, she also believes in being a strong advocate for the child when the parent feels that professionals are missing the child's symptoms and special needs.  <br /> <br />Each section includes informational material interspersed with personal vignettes from the author and many other parents. I liked that she included stories from so many families, because each family encounters different professionals, schools and social situations. With so many voices, parents will find some that reflect their own experiences.  <br /> <br />Figuring out what you are dealing with: Children with bipolar disorder and other related conditions often go through many different diagnoses, therapies and school settings. Diagnosis and treatment are often an ongoing journey, even if you have excellent clinicians and a good school. She provides solid information to help parents ask intelligent questions and challenge opinions that do not seem to fit.  <br /> <br />Adjusting to the diagnosis: She talks about the emotional rollercoaster that most parents experience when they are trying to come to grips with the fact that their child has a severe, probably chronic disorder. How do you love this child? How do you deal with your own anger and grief? Sometimes stressed, grieving parents do make mistakes.  <br /> <br />Helping your child get treatment: She talks about interactions with therapists and school systems. this section is useful for parents who need suport in feeling empowered to speak up.  <br /> <br />The sections on taking care of yourself and on having a bipolar child in the family are my favorites. I hope that clinicians read these sections. Ideally, children with bipolar disorder should have two parents in the house and a supportive extended family. Too often though, marriages fall apart under the strain. When confronted with a difficult child, clinicians should immedately do whatever they can to support the family structure and build in comunity support. The author talks about how she and other families found outside support, even when marriages were failing and extended families did not understand.  <br /> <br />Helping your child like with bipolar disorder: Finally she discusses how you talk to your child and help him or her develop a positive self esteem. It is difficult to determine how you teach the child responsibility for his or her actions.	2005-01-15

A Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder	Books	5	63	66	N	N	A classic that I often recommend to newly diagnosed adults	First, I want to start with the title: It is so reassuring and affirming. How many adults and older teens have thought this when they first realized that they had AD/HD? Even the illustrations have a humorous, comfy, reassuring feel.  <br /> <br />This book deals with the every day practicalities of living with AD/HD. First, the authors reassure the reader that he or she is not bad or blameworthy. This is good, but then they go on to help the individual to take charge. Ultimately this leads to a new sense of empowerment and an enlightened sense of responsibility. The book deals with the often overlooked issues of scheduling, spirituality, adequate sleep and maintaining social supports. <br /> <br />My favorite chapter is the one on how to organize your workspace. This chapter is worth the price of the book. So often people waste time getting up and looking for the stapler or the stamps when a few organizational tips could give them less reason to get up and get distracted.  <br /> <br />Best of all for this book: It also comes as an audiocassette!! I personally prefer the book because you can refer back to the individual chapters. If you are not a book reader, consider getting the cassette, and then buying the book so that you can refer to pertinent chapters.	2005-01-15

I had originally bought this book for use in my waiting room. However, some of the sexual humor and the irreverant approach to religious figures meant that it was a \\"stay at home\\" book. (Don't tell the IRS) <br /> <br />Now that the book is in its proper place, I should add that I enjoyed it immensely and went on to buy Volumes 2 and 3. (not on my office account though)The book starts with evolution of the earth and its creatures. The pictures were well done and the humor makes the factual material easier to remember.  <br /> <br />The bulk of the book deals with the history of the human race. The author does not confine himself to European civilization. Two of my children read all three volumes, and I did not have to hassle them to do it. How often does this happen with other history texts? I am hoping to use their interest in some of the historical topics to encourage them to read other books. Each section of the Cartoon History contains a reference section for those who desire further reading.  <br /> <br />Ideally this book should be a companion to serious textbooks on history. However, there are a lot of people who are unwilling and unable to absorb material from textbooks or lectures. People who are visual learners may be able to remember the pictures and the humor when they have trouble remembering college lecutres or long passages of text. I have recommended this and some other of the author's books to individuals who were having trouble with basic college classes.	2005-01-09

Tiredness, irritability, and mood changes are more difficult to explain than something concrete and visible like a broken leg.  Sometimes the treatments make the parent more depressed. In the absence of good understanding, the child may blame herself or her parent. <br /> <br />This book describes a young girl whose mother has Hepatitis C. The story is clear and straightforward. It does a good job of explaining the illness and showing that the mother loves her child even when she is feeling ill. However, the plot is fairly plain, and the characters do not come alive.  <br /> <br />I have recommended this book to mothers and fathers who are dealing with hepatitis C.	2005-01-09

Parents and professionals have trouble understanding and dealing with it. So, how do you explain it to a child?    Matt, a young hermit crab, lives with his parents, brother and sister. His rapid, extreme mood swings annoy, puzzle and frighten his family. As his emotional shifts worsen, he has trouble staying in class and is aggressive toward his friends. Matt shows many of the difficult behaviors seen in such children. He goes through periods of physical aggression, paranoid thoughts, and suicidal feelings. Some manic individuals may make inappropriate sexual advances. The book touches on this briefly without being too explicit.     I liked how the book dealt with the social consequences of mood swings. As Matt's symptoms grow worse, even the people who care about him get frustrated and react. Matt's first experience with therapy is in a hospital setting, and the book does not say much about outpatient treatment or psychotherapy. At the end of the book, we see Matt gain a better understanding of his illness. He is able to take an active role in explaining his Bipolar Disorder to his class.     This book has some limitations, but many the limitations are due to the complexity of the subject matter. The illustrations and the use of hermit crabs and other beach animals might appeal to younger elementary aged children, but the hundred plus pages of text may prove daunting for some of the younger readers. It would be difficult to cover this material in a short book. Parents may want to read the book with their children and break it up into smaller chunks. I may wish that the author had talked more about individual and family therapy, but you can't fit everything into a book aimed at children.      There is a companion guidebook (purchased separately.) It helps parents and professionals use the book to lead a discussion with children.	2005-01-09

It is readable, knowledgeable and thorough. It helps adolescents understand what they might be feeling when they are depressed. It discusses how to interrupt the downward spiral and find a way out. The book covers both social and biological aspects of depression.  <br /> <br />I felt that the author had a good intuitive grasp for how an adolescent might feel when he was in the depths of a depression. She reflects back the sense of isolation and hopelessness so that a depressed person feels understood. She provides information on how to get help when you don't feel that anyone out there is trustworthy.  <br /> <br />She empowers teens by providing good information about the causes of depression and well as the treatments. For those who want more detailed information, she provides a resource list. I especially liked her section on how to stay healthy once you have recovered from the initial depression.  <br /> <br />I have recommended this book to several teens. They felt that it made sense and was helpful	2005-01-09

I often talk to teens who carry the burden of their friends' depression. They perceive parents and teachers as out of touch, so they try to handle each other's depression themselves. This can be stressful and even dangerous. If a friend confides suicidal thoughts and then actually commits suicide, the adolescent may have to deal with severe guilt and remorse.  <br /> <br />When I first saw the title of this book, I was afraid that the author was just going to try to train teens to be the primary therapists for their depressed peers. Actually this book is realistic but also quite responsible. It repeatedly warns teens not to keep silent when a friend is suicidal.  <br /> <br />This book helps teens recognize the signs of depression and suicidal thoughts in their peers, and suggests ways to help. It also talks about taking care of oneself after a friend has actually committed suicide. It does discuss the importance of going to a responsible adult if a friend is really in trouble.  <br /> <br />I often recommend this book.	2005-01-09

However, its description of recurrent major depression is so good that the book would be valuable for adolescents and some adults. It is realistic, but ultimately comforting. <br /> <br />The story describes a boy's feelings about his mother's depression and her resistance to treatment. Although her depression is affecting the whole family, her husband is reluctant to pressure her into seeking help. Eventually she suggests that she would be better off dead. At that point, her hsuband her husband insists that she must see her psychiatrist Once she accepts treatment, she gradually begins to improve. <br /> <br />I like the fact that the mother's improvement is gradual, not a dramatic, overnight awakening. Even after she gets back into treatment, the illustrations suggest some residual depression. However, by the end of the book, she is smiling and beginning to return to her creative photography work.   <br /> <br />The book describes the importance of family participation in the mother's treatment. The boy attends some of his mother's sessions and is able to ask questions about her illness. The whole process of treatment is much more mysterious for children if they never get to see the psychiatrist and the inside of the office. The parents explain why it is important that his mother take her medication regularly. He is reassued that the depression is not his fault. Ultimately, the boy is able to gain knowledge and a sense of mastery. <br /> <br />Since I treat both children and adults, I often see how deeply a parent's depression affects the children. I used to recommend this book a lot, but had stopped doing so because I thought it was out of print.  Now that I have found it again, I will be telling people about it.	2005-01-08

This is good because some people want to know about a specific class of medications, while others want an overview of medication strategies for a particular disorder.  <br /> <br />The new edition covers some of the newer medications such as Strattera. It discusses some of the recent cautions about the use of antidepressants in children but, due to the publication date does not have the fall 2004 FDA warnings.  <br /> <br />I particularly liked the suggestions on communication between parent and psychiatrist. This should help parents formulate their questions and feel comfortable asking them. In this age of managed care, parents need to be educated advocates for their children. This book can give parents the tools they need to be assertive when they talk to their child's psychiatrist.  <br /> <br />This book is also an excellent overview for medical residents and non-medical mental health professionals. I often suggest that psychiatrists in training read this book.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-31

These issues include hormonal changes, motherhood, and career planning. The book discusses both medication and non-medication treatments in detail. There are chapters on how diagnosis of AD/HD in women, medical issues for women with AD/HD, how to get social and occupational support, and related conditions such as depression. There are useful sections for women at different stages of their lives.  <br /> <br />The editors include their own view on the diagnosis of AD/HD in women. they take a much broader view of AD/HD than what is included in the standard DSM diagnostic definitions.  <br /> <br />The articles are generally interesting and readable for the general public. The chapters are arranged by topic. This makes it easy for the reader to pick out the subjects that she finds particularly relevant.  <br /> <br />The authors discuss proven treatments, but also discuss treatments that have not yet been shown effective in rigorous studies. The book was published in early 2002. Since then there have been new published studies on the effects of hormone replacement on older women.  <br /> <br />All in all, the book does a good job of showing the varied experiences of women with AD/HD.

Adults who are addicted to tobacco often wonder how they can have the moral authority to tell their children not to smoke. This book will help them keep their children from falling into the tobacco addiction trap. This excellent illustrated book tells about smoking from the points of view of a girl and her grandfather. The information from the grandfather is particularly compelling. He explains to his granddaughter that he still smokes because he is addicted and has tried many times to stop. He expresses anger that he is addicted.  <br />The granddaughter observes people smoking and chewing tobacco. Her observations and the illustrations convey the \\"yuckiness\\" of tobacco. Some people who are not moved by long-term consequences, can understand the unattractive, unappealing aspects of tobacco. Between the girl's observations and the grandfather's discussion, children are experience both the short and long term effects of smoking. <br />This book should be interesting and accessible to elementary school and middle school-aged children and adolescents. Parents who are recovering from other types of addictions might also make use of this book when they talk to their children.<br />Carol Watkins, M.D.	2004-04-13

She honestly describes her own difficulties understanding and translating her husband's reactions into her own more emotionally demonstrative frame of reference. <br />I got the impression that she would have liked her husband to write more about his perspective on their relationship. He does give some information but he is not an &quot;express your emotions&quot; type of guy. <br />I have refered several people to this book. It is good for individuals who are learning to appreciate and deal with a family member with Aspergers.

She seemed a bit intimidated or uninformed about some of the more active jungle type adventures. <br />Belize is a great country to visit, both for the adventurous and for those who like to lie around on the beach.

YEAH,RIGHT!!<br />Well.... actually...maybe he will.<br />Vinnie encourages you to take charge of your menstrual cycle by charting it and keeping track of how stress, foods and other events affect their menstrual experience. Every other page contains a roller coaster picture with the days of the month. You put stickers on dates corresponding to PMS days and Menstrual Flow days. \\"Psychic Dice\\" go on the following month to help predict the next period. <br />Everything in the book is upfront.

I grew up with Hugh Lofting's books and wanted my children to read them. As Dr. Dolittle learns to communicate with animals, we begin to think about feelings and habits of individuals very different from ourselves.<br />Dr. Dolittle did not fit in with many of the stuffier aspects of British society. Thus, he was a miserable failure as a human doctor. His animals recognized his caring spirit and taught him to become an outstanding animal doctor. The stories contain suspense and adventure but there is little explicit violence. The animal characters, Jip the dog, Gub Gub the pig, Polinesia the parrot each have their own personalities and become friends with the reader.<br />Hugh Lofting was an Englishman of the early 20th century. As such, he used some troubling phrases that might be considered racist. Much of this seems to have been deleted or modified in the current version of this book.<br />I wanted my children to read all of the other Dr. Dolittle books. Unfortunately most of them are out of print. Thank goodness,I was able to find a number of the other titles in the Amazon.com used book section.	2002-05-04

It consists of a series of brief articles dealing with ways to support yourself or your child through stresses associated with diabetes. <br />Chapters include topics such as surviving the preteens, beating stress and dealing with negative thoughts. Each chapter is written by a different author.<br />I see this as a book you can keep in the bathroom, by the bed or in the car.

Stein and Murray have written a well-organized book that covers the subject matter well without being overwhelming. For individuals who desire more detail on specific areas, there is an appendix that refers the reader to appropriate books, organizations and Internet resources. <br />The book is divided into three sections: The first, \\"Understanding Shyness and Social Anxiety\\" defines the problem and explains how social anxiety fits into one end of a continuum of human behavior. It helps one determine whether one's shyness is a benign personality trait, a moderate inconvenience, or an urgent clinical problem. Bulleted lists enumerate specific symptoms that may be associated with social anxiety. I particularly liked the subsection on other conditions that are commonly associated with social anxiety. In this and other sections, they discuss how self-medicating with alcohol or drugs can lead to chemical dependency.  There is a section on choosing the right treatment. I mostly agreed with this section but would have liked to see more on choosing the right therapist. Too often, people start work with a therapist without inquiring into the therapist's credentials or finding out whether the therapist has any way of being reached after hours. <br />The Second Section was my favorite. If you do not have the time or energy to read this entire book, focus on this section. The book is mostly oriented toward self-help, so this part includes specific techniques to help the individual deal with both the physical and the mental aspects of the anxiety. There are several simple worksheets and instructions on how to use them. The authors give examples of clear useful goals and also give examples of goals that are too vague or are unattainable. <br />The third section deals with ways to enhance one's social life. This is something often not seen in a clinically oriented book. Once an individual has overcome his or her initial shyness, he or she may still be left with social deficits. Because of long-standing shyness, the individual may not have had the opportunity to learn and practice starting a conversation or asking someone for a date. This section is only able to cover these issues with a broad brush. However, the appendix lists several sources of more detailed information.<br />I would recommend this book for individuals who want to take the first steps to overcome their fear of social situations. The book may also be helpful for professionals who want to learn more about how their patients can actively help themselves.	2002-03-21

Parenting books often fall into the trap of a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to parenting. Dr. Phelan acknowledges that adolescents often have different temperaments and may require varying types of parenting approaches. <br />Communication between parent and adolescent is a tricky thing. It is easy to stymie the flow of information. He lists several &quot;dos&quot; and &quot;don't&quot; that may help keep the lines of comunication open. He illustrates each of these points with real-life vignettes. He discusses general guidelines for when it is better for the parent to intervene; when to just let go; and when to seek professional consultation. <br />I am glad that this title is available in audiocassette form. Parents today are often busy with work, home duties and carpooling. A casette, or anything that is practical and saves time, is great.	2002-03-03

He explains concepts clearly and cuts quickly to the heart of important issues. I particularly enjoyed his discussion of the process getting an evaluation for AD/HD. He advocates a thorough, systematic approach to diagnosis. He explains how to make sure that the professionals have covered all of the bases.<br />He discusses how AD/HD can affect both adults and children. However, he tends to put more emphasis or child and adolescent issues.  <br />Dr. Phelan does not pull punches or sugar-coat the issues. He makes it clear that AD/HD can make life challenging for individual and family. This directness is both the strength and weakness of this tape (and book.) The first couple of chapters tend to emphasize the difficulties. You have to wait a while before you get to the parts that give you some hope. The first couple of chapters might have you thinking about trading your child in for a non-defective model. But stick it out--by the end of the book you will have a clearer idea of the steps you can take to resolve difficulties.<br />I am pleased that this book is available in an audiocassette version. Many families affected by AD/HD are already spread too thin. They may not have the time or the attention span to sit down and read an entire book. This particular audiocassette was produced in a professional manner. Dr. Phelan reads didactic material and actors dramatize family anecdotes.

We had often joked with our kids about the &quot;real reasons&quot; that we asked them to do things, but David Wisniewski did a much better job of expanding and illustrating these types of fantasies. I decided to buy two--one for each of my office waiting rooms. However, my kids could not bear to part with one copy so I got three. Some of Mr. Wisniewski's scenarios get mentioned regularly around our dinner table, &quot;Eat your vegetables so they won't eat you--I think I see a claw coming out from your salad!&quot;<br />Sometimes I use this book to illustrate more serious issues. Conflicting agendas: When a family has a problem, the parents and the children often define the problem differently and have different hopes for the outcome. Power differences: Young children may see adults as having secret information and mysterious conversations behind closed doors. This book helps parents and kids look at these issues gently and laugh about them. This may soften the way toward discussing a family's conflicts and differing points of view. <br />The illustrations are excellent detailed cutouts. They are bold and dramatic. He makes use of multiple textures to give the cutouts a 3-dimensional fee. Some of the pictures are &quot;gross.&quot; If you pick your nose, your brain may deflate. But the &quot;gross-out&quot; factor is funny, not scary or violent.<br />I get the sense that the author must be a funny, kind individual.

He uses clear verbal explanations and diagrams to explain his assertions. He summarizes a vast body of theoretical work and makes extensive use of footnotes. <br />I was also interested to read his views on the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. (FMSF) He provides some background information on members of this organization that one will not find in their literature. <br />However, I was disapointed in the lack of objectivity. Although he explains his theoretical assertions well, he is a &quot;true believer.&quot; He dwells more on the flaws of cases and research that disagree with his point of view. He is much less critical of material that supports his point of view. His footnotes are of uneven quality. It is often not clear which footnotes reference carefully done research and which are simply the assertions of a popular book author. <br />I felt that his definition of a dysfunctional family is too broad. He asserts that the vast majority of families are dysfunctional. Thus most individuals are wounded and should be in a recovery program. I was particularly disturbed by his critique of the American jury system, &quot;Judges and juries have inherent deficiencies. A jury is a group of from six to 12 people who come from the general population, of which about 95% has been estimated to have grown up in an unhealthy, troubled or dysfunctional family and a troubled world. Most judges and members of juries will thus be unrecovered adult children of a dysfunctional family and world...&quot; (p. 211) I too am sometimes frustrated by court decisions, but Dr. Whitfield's extreme view on this matter has worrisome implications. <br />He asserts that only a small minority of therapists have actually unduely pressured their patients into false memories. He may be right, but I think that he could go further to acknowlege some of theexcesses that have occurred in the recent past. <br />On the positive side, he gives clear guidelines for informed consent when a therapist is embarking on trauma work. He cautions against delving into memory work without first taking a thorough history. He also gives cautions about confrontations between a victim and an alleged abuser. <br />All in all, I am glad I read this book. However, Dr. Whitfield hurts his case by his bias. He would be more convincing if he were more even handed in his presentation of data.	2001-12-14

The next page gives clear instructions on how to get the situation under control and when to call for help. Some of the situations include: dealing with an electrical blackout, being followed by a stranger, finding an injured animal, and what to do when a friend appears to have sustained a head injury. <br />I showed this book to children of varying ages. It elicited interest from children as young as six and as old as high school. One bright six-year-old buried himself in the book, sounding out the hard words because the information made him feel empowered. Older children picked and chose which situations they read but liked the straightforward approach. <br />This book would be good for a general population of children and young adolescents. However, it would be especially helpful to children who have social skills deficits.	2001-12-09

This is a great book for the individual with a disability who is thinking about getting off public assistance or who is just planning to switch jobs. This would also be a good book for any employer who might hire an individual with a disability. <br />Often both employers and prospective employees have misconceptions about what the law says about disabilitiy. The book explains how the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) protects individuals with disabilities. At the same time, it also explains what the ADA will not do. <br />I particularly liked the section on creative ways to interview for a job. Having a disability may make one seem strange and unfamiliar to a prospective employer. The book suggests creative ways to emphasize how one is also similar to the employer. Even if you do not have a disability, you may still want to read some of these clever suggestions. <br />It is often difficult to get disability benefits in the first place. This makes returning to work seem a risky proposition: What if you try to go to work and you are really not ready. If you fail, will you lose your disability benefits and have to start all over again? The book explains ways to protect some degree of benefits while easing back into the work force.<br />The two authors blend their areas of expertise to produce an outstanding book. The book is divided into sections with clear explanations and objectives. In the back of the book there are useful appendices with resources for further help and support.	2001-11-26

Book: A Story to Help Children Overcome Fears	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Several children who read it were unimpressed	Having read some of Stephen Lankton's professional texts, I had high hopes for this book. However, the book did not live up to my expectations. I read it to several children and they felt that there was not much substance to the book. (The kids actually put their comments in much more direct English)<br />The book uses metaphorical language as well as direct insturction to help children who have specific fears (phobias.) In the story, a more experienced child, Knowsis, helps another child, Terry deal with her fears of the circus. Knowsis teaches Terry to access feelings of confidence and contentment. He then shows her how to experience these feelings when she is in a frightening situation. <br />The theory behind this book is good. However it just does not translate well in this book format. Into The Great Forest is a better picture book for helping children with fears.	2001-11-16

It helps normalize the feelings that a sibling might have, and indicates that adults are available for support. The black and white drawings do a good job of being accurate, but still showing warmth and emotion.<br />This book is specifically aimed at children who are about four to eight years old. When one of my own children was hospitalized and had surgery, I thought of this book and brought it out for my other children. <br />This book tells the story of a young girl, whose baby sister is admitted into a hospital. The baby sister needs surgery, and the older girl is very unhappy. The older sister is initially angry at how Molly is getting all the attention. Later, she feels guilty and wonders if she somehow caused Molly's illness.  <BR>     <BR>The author had a child who had a chronic condition and underwent surgery. She saw how her older children experienced the sibling's illness. The illustrator is a physician who left the clinical practice of medicine to pursue her artwork and to raise her own family. Her medical background may help account for the superb, sensitive illustrations.	2001-11-16

The book is organized into sections so that a busy teacher or parent does not have to pour over the whole book in order to deal with a specific problem.  You can immediately tell what chapter and which page will deal with each specific educational challenge. <br />When she makes suggestions, she generally includes information on specific materials, such as organizers, notecards, that might be necessary to set up a particular strategy. I liked her section on written expression. She covers essays and even the production of poetry. I have recommended many of the techniques she covers. Her section on medication is better than what I see in many books about AD/HD. She highlights the importance of understanding how long a given medication actually lasts. Often students are blamed for irritable behavior that occurs during periods when the medication has actually worn off.  <br />I would recommend this book to both parents and educators. Although it is written for teens, it might also be helpful individuals dealing with some older elementary school students.	2001-11-15

He wrestles when he plays, he watches violent TV and he loves war toys. Eventually his fighting gets out of hand and begins to land him in trouble at home and in school. He feels isolated and becomes even more angry. <br />He and his mother go to see the school guidance counselor. She helps the parents reward his good behavior and limit some of his angry outbursts. The parents do not take away all his TV, but they set sensible limits on what he watches. They do not take away all of his war toys. Instead, the parents play with him and use the play to help him express himself. <br />In school, he joins the counselor's friendship group and begins to learn more positive ways of relating to his peers.  As he becomes less angry, he is happier. He still likes his army men, but he is able to keep this sort of game in a reasonable persepctive. <br />The illustrations are wonderful; both children and adults will love them. The pictures catch Douglas'irritable anger as well as his later times of enthusiasm and joy. <br />The author never gives Douglas a specific psychiatric diagnosis. I liked that fact. Thus the book can resonate with a broad range of kids and parents.	2001-11-07

An OCD Storybook	Books	5	52	52	N	N	Superb explanation of OCD and its treatment	This is one of my all-time favorite children's mental health books! I have waited a long time to write a review of this book. Until recently it was not listed on .... When I diagnose a child or adolescent with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I urge the family to buy this book. <br />Children with OCD often suffer in secret. They are ashamed and confused by their symptoms. Most of them think that they are crazy or that they are the only one in the world who has these awful thoughts and weird behaviors. <br />The book uses barnyard characters to illustrate the common types of OCD. The pig compulsively washes and clears his throat. The horse blinks and taps his hoof. The cow worries about contaminating her milk. The hen needs to line up her grain and straighten her feathers. <br />The OCD itself is depicted as a tiny obnoxious flea, \\"OC Flea.\\" This little flea is the one who whispers the words that cause the obsessions and compulsions. He whispers to all the animals, but some of them are just more sensitive to his words. I won't give away the entire plot, but events transpire that make it impossible for the animals to complete their obsessive rituals. They discover that nothing bad happens, and begin to free themselves from their obsessions and compulsions. The animals (and in one case an animal's mother) learn to change their behavior so that they can banish \\"O.C. Flea.\\" A pig makes up a sign to help himself and the other animals guard against the return of \\"O.C. Flea.\\" Near the end of the story, the owl explains how O.C. D. works and how it is treated. Some of the vocabulary and concepts are fairly advanced, so an adult should read this with the child to make sure that he or she understands. Although the book is aimed at children, it might be useful for an OCD adult with a sense of humor. <br />When I do therapy with children with OCD, I often encourage them to think of the OCD as a silly or obnoxious creature that is outside of themselves. They can laugh at this creature or fight it. This book helps a child look at the OCD as something he can beat, not a personal failure. <br />If you have a child or adolescent with OCD, get this book right away!	2001-11-02

Like the food pyramid, the first steps are the basic staples and other steps follow. Basic, factual knowledge serves as the basis. He discusses other common challenges faced by the family of a young person with diabetes. I particularly liked his sections on communication and on dealing with crises. He shows how certain common family conflicts might play themselves out in a family affected by diabetes. <br />He does a superb job of discussing the specific self-care steps a young person must master in order to move toward independent diabetes management. Some families and clinicians have set ideas about when a child should manage the diabetes independently. He takes a more moderate view. One must judge the developmental readiness of each individual child and adolescent. <br />In the section on dealing with the health care team, he talks about gradually allowing the child and then the adolescent to take a more central role in communicating with his care team.	2001-10-31

Emily's parents and brother have done an excellent job of understanding and addressing Ben's AD/HD. However, Emily feels that her parents are ignoring her. She feels that they expect her to maintain perfect behavior so that the parents can focus on Ben's problems. Emily and the rest of the family work with Ben's therapist to gain an understanding of Emily's own needs. <br />The book deals with psychotherapy and family issues in a clear but relatively sophisticated manner. I liked the fact that it addressed Emily's feelings about her parents' time-consuming involvement with advocacy groups. Family involvement in advocacy organizations is critical, but parents also need to seek a balance that includes regular family down time. <br />This book may also be useful for any girl who feels that her over-committed family expects her to be too perfect.  <br />This book is aimed at the older elementary school or middle school child. There is more text and relatively few illustrations.	2001-10-25

He takes us along with him on his quest to help his son learn. Along the way, we meet a variety of clinicians, educators and other experts. Professionals might do well to read these sections to help them understand how strongly their words and actions may affect a distressed parent. <br />Dr. Roseman had decades of experience compensating for his own AD/HD and learning disabilities. When he discovered that his oldest son had similar difficulties, he determined that his son would have a different experience from his own. Watching his son's struggles and triumphs was an intense experience, unearthing many varied emotional reactions. Dr. Roseman recounts his own memories of the pain and humiliation he experienced as a child when his school and his parents expressed frustration. At the same time, Dr. Roseman remembers how he had been able to use his energy and creativity to find unique ways around his disabilities. <br />This book emphasizes the need for individualized approaches for AD/HD and learning disabled children. To Dr. Roseman's credit he does not give blanket dismissals to legitimate treatments that did not work well for his particular child. <br />Not every parent can or should do what this parent did. Many readers will not have the energy, the time or the financial resources to teach their own child. This intense identification between parent and child can be a powerful positive force so long as the parent is able to allow space for other family members and friends. <br />When Dr. Roseman talks about his long intense periods with minimal sleep, I could understand the rationale of the psychiatrist who wrote a prescription for Lithium. On the other hand, I think of the intense bond between Helen Keller and her teacher. Often intense, passionate involvement enriches our world.	2001-10-11

After I had read their book on the history of dining, I couldn't wait for this one. Tubs, Toilets and Showers handles the awkward subjects of what you do in the bathroom and how people used to do it. It has vignettes from several cultures and time periods.<br />Many children (and some adults) will be surprised to learn that the Europeans came to value cleanliness much later than did many other cultures. They may laugh to imagine how certain historical figures might have smelled. <br />Since the book deals with bathing and eliminating, some of the illustrations do involve nudity. However, the illustrator has drawn the cartoons in such a way that genital areas are hidden. I would not find the drawings objectionable for young children. <br />Baths and hygiene are often areas of conflict between parents and children. A book like this could give some perspective, and its humor could soften the family bathroom struggles.	2001-08-19

This story could help students in a classroom understand the behavior of a classmate with these characteristics. Instead of labeling behaviors as &quot;obnixious&quot; the other students might be stimulated to see the world from the perspective of the child with Aspergers.<br />This book is not meant to be a comprehensive text, but it describes the reactions and feelings of a particular individual. Because people with Aspergers are each so unique, it might not fit the exact behaviors of each person. Still, it is a good book because it gets you thinking from a another perspective--and that is what Aspergers is about.	2001-07-07

She emphasizes that each person has his or her own unique feelings. Different individuals might make different, equally valid choices for the beloved pet. <br />I liked the sections on complicated grief. Pet loss can often reactivate deeper feelings about past losses. The pet's death may be a chance to work through other life experiences. <br />Many of her general suggestions for dealing with pet loss could be useful for the entire family. <br />The section on children's reactions to pet loss could have been stronger.

The first tells how a boy deals with the death of his uncle. The second, how students deal with the sudden death of a classmate. The third tells of a girl who is at the bedside with her family when her grandmother dies. Each one deals with the sad feelings surrounding death, but also celebrates the life of the deceased individual. Each story ends with how the children cope and come to terms with loss. Before and after each story are poems that connect death with the celebration of life. These explain that endings and beginnings are all connected. I was particularly impressed with the sensitive way that the author deals with a child's sadness and gently shows ways of coping. She notes that the sadness may never completely go away, but that eventually it is outweighed by understanding and new forms of mastery.	2001-06-17

This can be their first experience with grief and can help shape how they deal with later experiences with loss. This illustrated book deals with a child's feelings about the loss of a beloved pet. Mr. Rogers is sensitive but clear and direct when he explains  the finality of death. This book can also be used to initiate a conversation about the death of a relative in a less threatening way. The parent may want to read the book as well to help explain it to the child. <br />Carol E. Watkins, M.D.	2001-06-17

I found this enjoyable and engaging. There is enough information without excessive detail. I felt as if I were having a lively conversation with good friends who all had a personal experience with my condition. I got through the whole book in an evening after the kids were in bed. <br />Individuals can experience a variety of negative emotions in response to the stress of living with diabetes. The same type of emotion may show up at different points in the course of the disorder. Emotions can have a huge effect on one's ability to maintain good diabetic control. <br />The authors give clear understandable vignettes that illustrate how an emotion such as anger can cause glucose levels to skyrocket. They also suggest ways of coping with these emotional states. At the same time, they do not malign all unpleasant emotions. Sometimes, fear, anger and denial might serve a useful purpose. <br />I did have a small stylistic concern. I would have preferred that the three authors either all use their first names or all use their formal titles. <br />I enjoyed reading this book. I think the conversational style would lend itself well to an audiocassete version.	2001-06-09

They prefer to find ways to work things out in less confrontational ways. However if all else fails, they explain how to proceed in the legal arena.<br />The book discusses when to disclose an AD/HD-related disability and when it might be prudent to be silent. It makes suggestions about simple accomadations that might make work easier for both employee and employer. <br />There may have been some changes in the law since this book first came out, but most of the general principals are the same.<br />Carol E.

A boy spends time with his grandfather walking in the out of doors. As he grows, he asks his grandfather about the nature of prayer. The grandfather explains prayer in terms of  the way nature reaches upward. Later he talks to his grandson about the prayer of humans, and how prayers are answered. <br />When the boy becomes an adolescent, his grandfather dies and no amount of prayer will bring him back to life. For a time, the adolescent abandons prayer. Eventually he again experiences prayerfulness out in nature. <br />Families of different religious and humanistic backgrounds can use this story to explain man's experience of the infinite. The book and its illustrations deal sensitively with nature, love and death. This illustrated book is appropriate for children and adolescents.	2001-06-02

The parents may have tried to explain, but the concept of psychotherapy may be too abstract to explain easily.<br />This illustrated book is a good way to introduce a young child to the idea of psychotherapy. It helps the child understand why he is going to see a child psychiatrist and what he might expect. <br />The story describes a bear cub, Ignatius, who has behavior problems while his bear family is experiencing a period of stress.

Some, such as Thanksgiving, are at least built around a complete meal. Halloween tends to emphasize the eating of large quantities of sweets. <br />Even kids who have adjusted well to their diabetes may feel left out during food-oriented celebrations. At such times, other kids are allowed to break their usual meal patterns. The child with diabetes is made more acutely aware of his or her difference.<br />The story illustrates a mother and daughter using creative problem solving. The girl is fairly confident with her usual diabetic management, but goes to her mother for advice on how to deal with special situations. The mother enlists the help of the girl's grandmother and teacher. Together they make plans that allow the girl to participate in the Halloween festivities and enjoy a few sweet treats without compromising her diabetic control. She exchanges most of her treats for money, and keeps a few of her favorites for when she has a low blood sugar emergency. The family also emphasizes that many of the fun, social parts of Halloween can be enjoyed whether or not one is eating all the same things as one's friends.<br />I think that the Halloween plan in this book might work well for many children with diabetes. <br />Carol Watkins, M.D.	2001-06-01

Throughout the book, the child or young teen reader is confronted with  difficult decisions. The reader's choice influences the outcome of the story. Unfortunately, I felt that this particular book is considerable weaker than the &quot;Decision is Yours&quot; series.<br />In this book, a girl is struggling to come to terms with her parents' divorce. Although the reader is offered a brancing plot based on choices, most of the decisions seem to end up with a similar happy ending. The daughter always seems to quickly come to accept her father's remarriage. I think that this sort of book works better if you have the option to come to an unhappy ending. Children may benefit from trying out several different scenarios and different types of endings. This book does not give the child this option. I found myself getting frustrated when each time I chose a different path, I still ended up in the same warm cozy place.<br />Carol E. Watkins, M.D.	2001-05-29

He demystifies the nature and symptoms of the disorder and explains the interaction of the biological and behavioral elements of OCD. <br />His program focuses on empowering the individual with OCD so that he or she can take an active role in decreasing or eliminating obsessions and compulsions. I often recommend the book to adults and adolescents who have OCD. When a person with OCD is engaged in cognitive-behavioral therapy, treatment is more successful if the individual feels empowered and does &quot;homework&quot; outside of the therapy session. This book reinforces this process.<br />I find that many people just do not have the time or patience to read an entire book, even one as good as this one. I have recommended the abridged audiocassette to a number of people who otherwise might never have been exposed to these concepts.

Adamec<br />I had mixed feelings about this book. Many parts of this book would be quite useful for a mother with mild AD/HD. The author does a good job of dealing with the family interactions that can occur when more than one family member has AD/HD.  It can be difficult for any parent to attend to the needs of a child with AD/HD. The author makes suggestions for simplifying behavioral plans and household routines. She talks about how a mother with AD/HD responds differently to her children with and without AD/HD. She addresses relationship pitfalls between an AD/HD mother and her non-AD/HD child.     I had concerns about some of the material in Parts 3 and 4.<br />In Part 3, (Special Struggles) She lists certain types of abusive behavior that make one a \\"bad mother.\\" I think that she was trying to make the valid point that most mothers with AD/HD are good mothers. Unfortunately, she seems to dismiss any mother who has ever engaged in abusive behavior. \\"Bad mother\\" is the last type of label such mothers need! How many AD/HD women have come close to hitting a child but stopped just in time? Those women should be thankful that someone along the line gave them enough nurturance and support so that they could stop themselves. When we see abuse, we should say, \\"There but for the grace of God go I.\\" We should take action to protect abused children, but we should should do it out of love and concern for both the parent and the child.  <br />In Part 4, (Getting Outside Help) The author did a good job of explaining why a psychiatric evaluation is important, and why the psychiatrist might want to take more than one session to do the evaluation. I was glad that she made suggestions for how an individual might screen a clinician. I am surprised at the number of people who will entrust a clinician with so much, after simply getting a name out of the phonebook.  As a psychiatrist, I feel that her depiction of our profession isnot entirely accurate. She wrote, \\"Most doctors, including psychiatrists, don't like treating severely mentally ill people and prefer to treat people with less severe mental disorders.\\" Yes, there are &quot;boutique&quot; clinicians who treat only the &quot;worried well.&quot; However, many of us treat a wide range of people. AD/HD, like many conditions, can vary in its severity. The best psychiatrist is one who has is willing and able to treat AD/HD in all its forms and degrees of severity.  <br />She says that she does not feel that AD/HD is a mental illness. What then is it-a chronic viral infection? I think that we are better off being accurate-calling it what it is-and holding our heads high. If society has prejudice about mental illness, we should combat the prejudice, not hide behind euphemisms. One can be accurate while still acknowledging the positive aspects of AD/HD.	2001-04-28

In the first book, Joey is diagnosed with AD/HD. The author deals humorously and sympathetically with Joey's impulsivity and how it gets him in trouble in school and at home.  Eventually Joey and his mother learn how to compensate through humor, educational strategies and medication.  The second book still retains some of the humor of the first, but deals with more serious issues. Joey's estranged father arranges to have Joey stay with him for the summer. The father clearly has ADHD symptoms similar to those of his son. Further, the father struggles with alcoholism and legal problems. During the summer, he makes Joey stop he medication. In his father Joey sees what he might have become. This second story deals with the very serious issues of custody disputes, parental disagreement about medication, alcoholism and its effect on a child with AD/HD. Some parents might want to read this book with their older elementary school and middle school children to explain some of these complex issues.

US	45990840	R3ZE4QGWLPH3H	051626074X	568228155	Extraordinary People with Disabilities	Books	5	5	5	N	N	I found myself drawn in to this book	Extraordinary People with Disabilities by Kent and Quinlan (Grolier Publishing 1996) This excellent book tells the stories of over 50 outstanding individuals who overcame their disabilities. It is written so that one can choose to read short segments. However, when I picked it up, I felt energized and needed to read it cover-to-cover.  The people profiled are from a variety of racial and economic backgrounds. Many of these individuals had physical disabilities but some of the stories profile people with learning or emotional disabilities. Through these stories, the book takes an activist stance. It tells of many who not only overcame their own disabilities, but went on to help other disabled people.  The stories make it easier to understand the points of view of disability rights activists. The final chapter gives an overview of  important new technological aids for the disabled. It explains why some of these aids are controversial among the disabled community. A glossary gives succinct definitions of many of the terms used in the book. An appendix at the back of the book list many of the major organizations that advocate for individuals with physical and mental disabilities. There is also a section listing related books and journals. I would recommend this book to high school students and adults.  Carol E Watkins, M.D. Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatrist	2001-01-02

The authors identify types of ADHD girls. Active girls may act like tomboys. They may socialize with boys. They are active, and may engage in impulsive escapades. Another group of girls shows their ADHD by talkativeness and excessive socializing. They too may become involved in risky behavior. Some girls with ADHD seem to fade into the background. They are shy and inattentive. They may have few friends and are more likely to be depressed. The last group is often escapes diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood. These are the very smart girls who have the ability to put in an extraordinary effort to hyper-focus. Adults see them as achievers but are often unaware of the anxiety and extreme effort the such girls use in order to compensate for their inattentiveness. Such girls are often anxious and self-critical. This is an excellent resource for parents and adolescents. I have only one criticism. The screening checklists in each chapter are fairly non-specific. The lists highlight the fact that ADHD may manifest itself differently in girls. However, some of the items on the lists can be caused by other conditions.  <br />Carol E.
