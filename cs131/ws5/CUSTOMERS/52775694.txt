I tried for a couple of hours to get into this, but I simply could not read it.<br /><br />Not that it's hard to understand. Quite the contrary. But I found it precious, affected, and silly.  Not to mention self-indulgent. Other than that, though . . .<br /><br />Sartwell defines beauty as \\"the object of longing.\\" He tells us he is \\"less concerned to defend that as a definition than to use it as a basis for trying to find something common to certain kinds of human experiences and relations to things.\\" Since we long for many things that are not beautiful, and commonalities between experiences and objects of longing may therefore have little to do with beauty, I find this approach less than promising.<br /><br />And indeed, Sartwell stretches the idea of beauty beyond any normal meaning, and he makes it useless as a category of discernment. For instance, Picasso's Guernica is not-and is not supposed to be-beautiful. It's a horror, and in its horror lies its grandeur-it's supposed to horrify us. To call it beautiful because it illustrates the satisfaction of the longing for power is to corrupt the term \\"beauty\\" and miss the point of the artwork.<br /><br />As for the self-indulgence, Sartwell has merely collected snippets of his reflections. He says this is \\"a book of moments, and can be dipped into rather than read straight through, though I also hope that the accumulation of moments displays a kind of structure that could yield a coherent set of experiences.\\" Well, if you invite someone to dip into your moments, you'd better be a genius, if they are to find such visits worthwhile. Sartwell isn't. One wonders whether he didn't bother to use his many moments to generate a coherent set of thoughts because that task was beyond him, or because he just couldn't be bothered. Either way, Sartwell's belief that his fragments of reflection are worth our while betrays a self-confidence that the twenty-five pages or so I pondered do not justify.<br /><br />And frankly, you have to puzzle over the perceptiveness of anyone anyone who refers to \\"the beauty of Jennifer Lopez\\" as \\"the skinniest common denominator of nubile beauty.\\"ustify.

For that purpose, the book has its uses.<br />However, unless you are a critical, already-knowledgeable reader, this book may not be a good choice. The book exemplifies neither the state of the art nor a model of how to think soundly about the questions.<br />Buss's hypotheses tend to be very vague. Indeed, he often says things like, \\"Evolutionary psychology explains this constellation of traits,\\" as if there were some one hypothesis held by all evolutionary psychologists.  He rarely, if ever, presents alternative hypotheses from within evolutionary studies.<br />He presents little, if any, contradictory or complicating data, never shows what would be involved in falsifying his hypotheses, and never shows why his theory is better supported than others' views of evolution. You get no sense from this book of the vigorous, usually exciting debates on mating *within* evolutionary circles.<br />You get litle or no sense from this book that problems of sexual adaptivity do not occur alone.  You would never know that for humans, copulation has less to do with reproduction than in nearly any other species-and that this complicates immensely understanding our evolved mating habits.<br />You would never know that  across the animal kingdom problems of mate selection depend heavily on what we eat and how we attain it.  You would never know that across the animal kingdom mating habits depend on social structure.  You get no sense that evolutionary psychology must grapple with the difficult questions of how other essential-and extremely odd-characteristics of human life set limits or biases on mating.  In general, you would think from reading Buss that mating has exclusively to do with reproduction or survival of offspring.<br />Indeed, if the logic of Buss's inquiry were correct, there would be no reason for species to differ sexually.  He presents his arguments as if human mating patterns follow directly from the differential investments of males and females.  But that difference exists in all species!  Why, then, do species differ so?  Buss doesn't even let you know (if he has even recognized) that this is a fundamental question.<br />You would never know from reading Buss the commonplace that motivation need not resemble function.  That is, a behavior (or traits) may be pursued for motives that have nothing to do with why it is reproductively advantageous.  For purpose of natural selection, why an organism prefers a behavior is of no moment.  Though he obviously knows this, and mentions it in passing a couple of places, he writes as if the function were the cause of the behavior.  In many, if not most, cases, we are caused to do something for reasons-e.g., how much fun it is-that have nothing to do with why it is naturally selected. This complicates understanding what's selected and why--especially since motivational systems have evolutionary and cultural histories of their own.<br />As others have noted, Buss's original work relies altogether too heavily on self-reports and \\"what if\\" questionnaires.<br />Now, we know fairly well (though Buss never tells you) that self-reports tend to reflect both cultural norms and a bias toward presenting one's self favorably (even, oddly enough, in anonymous questionnaires.) We can improve and cross-check self-reports, but the methods are cumbersome (requiring a great deal of time with each subject, generating massive amounts of data, and requiring extremely powerful statistical analyses) and expensive.  This book gives little evidence that much of Buss's data has been appropriately cross-checked.  And in fact, other researchers have shown that even with some of the same populations as Buss studied, more extensive testing shows results very different from Buss's.<br />However, we cannot cross-check answers to hypotheticals!  For instance, a question like, \\"How many sexual partners would you have in the next year, if you could?\\" cannot possibly be checked for accuracy.<br />However, you can do things like correlating answers to that question with other variables.  But it is not at all clear that Buss, suffering from a very simple-minded theory to guide his research, has tested for and analyzed the right variables. For instance, some researchers have shown that men suffering ambivalence and anxiety about sex tend to offer inflated numbers on questions like that-and that when data is analyzed controlling for psychopathology, men and women differ on the question far less than Buss claims.<br />Similarly, you'd never know from Buss the difficulties of identifying which of our traits are selected, and whether they are naturally or sexually selected.  Generally, you need to know what to explain before you start explaining it.<br />Buss's writing style misleads, too.  Though he does not overtly misrepresent his data, he places far more emphasis on ways that men and women disagree than agree, even though in fact his data show that the range of agreement vastly exceeds disagreement-and remains equally stable over time.<br />Generally, I think this book reflects more energy and ambition than insight and imagination.  Buss's data matter, precisely because they cover so many subjects in so many locations.  But the book also shows the danger of collecting massive amounts of data without an adequate theory to guide what you study.<br />The reason I structure my classes as I do is that, in fact, nobody knows yet just which elements of human life are accurately explained as naturally selected (or why or when), sexually selected (or why or when), cultural, geographical, and so forth.  I emphasize to my students that these questions matter deeply (and why), that we know the standard social science model to be false, and that we are just beginning to develop a reliable science of human evolution.  I want my students to be able to participate in the emerging inquiries, to know how to think correctly about data and about alternate candidates to explain the data.<br />To read Buss, you would think my design is all wrong-you'd think that the data are great, the answers are settled for all but the muddle-headed and stubborn, and that there are no alternative explanations.  And if, having read Buss, you thought those things, you would be wrong.<br />That's another reason I use this book.

The first ten chapters of this book rank, in my opinion, as probably the best single account of what we really do and do not know about human evolution.<br />In these first ten chapters, Diamond gives us dispassionate surveys of dominant theories and available evidence.  Here, it's not unusual for him to say something like, Here are the six dominant theories, here is the evidence that shows why four of them don't deserve serious consideation anymore in spite of their emotional or political appeal, and here are the relative scientific merits of the remainder.  In an arena beset by vicious ad hominem attacks and passionate ideological presentations of unproven theories, Diamond--in these first ten chapters--offers the student more concerned with truth than ideology a lovely account.<br />Among the important points he makes in these first ten chapters: Our genetic propensities toward cooperation, care for no-longer-procreative elders, and (in the case of women) outliving reproductive capacity set the stage for the evolution of the human brain. Genes may be &quot;selfish,&quot; but our genes' inclining us toward non-egoistic ways of life lie at the foundation of being human at all.  This is a crucial point, consistent with the ethical views and habits of all civilizations other than those that foster &quot;social Darwinism.&quot;  That our humanity depends on the falsity of &quot;social Darwinism&quot; cannot be emphasized too greatly.  Science supports the kind of other-oriented, community concern that all ethics, through all of human history--unlike allegedly &quot;enlightened&quot; egoism--codifies.  (See also the wonderful anthology, &quot;The Evolutionary Origins of Morality,&quot; LeonardD. Katz, editor.)<br />Beginning in chapter eleven, the book becomes progressively more speculative, more of a presentation of Diamond's own theories, some about things outside his area of professional expertise--e.g., the effects of continental differences in flora, fauna, and climate on differential developments of civilizations.  Here, we lose the critical comparative attitude of the first ten chapters. If you think carefully, you finish each of these latter chapters with a lot of, &quot;Yes, but . . . &quot; questions.  Thus, in the first ten chapters, you rightly come away with confidence that you've acquired a fair understanding of the state-of-the-art in evolutionary studies.  In the latter chapters, that simply isn't so.<br />I agree with most of the political and ideological principles underlying Diamnod's speculations, and I appreciate that--unlike many leading &quot;lights&quot; in studies of human evolution--he never resorts to name calling and acting as if those who differ are nefarious fools.  But I wish he'd either stopped writing after ten chapters, or made the latter chapters more like the first ten. Each of these latter chapters is intelligent and interesting, and each deserves further condieration; but Diamnond's shift in standards of assessment and style of presentation makes the second half of the book far less authoritative, and therefore makes the book as a whole something one can less enthusiastically recommend--or use in teaching.ven, the book becomes progressively more speculative, more of a presentation of Diamond's own theories, some about things outside his area of professional expertise--e.g., the effects of continental differences in flora, fauna, and climate on differential developments of civilizations.

I don't think students--or anyone else--should be talking about evolutionary psychology unless they understand the state-of-the-art in the sciences of evolution.<br />Outside of science, people seem to think the \\"big question\\" is whether evolution is a fact.  The cognoscenti pride themselves on knowing that it is, looking down upon religious fideists of various sorts who claim otherwise.  And vice versa.<br />Within science, though, that question does not even appear.  That evolution is a set of facts to be explained, not a hypothesis up for grabs, was settled within science a century ago.<br />For real scientists, the real debates--the real efforts to understand reality--take place over very different questions, and the various research programs differ very significantly.  This book is a nice overview of some of the leading issues.<br />If you are under the illusion that the debate is about whether evolution takes place, you will find this book kind of ho-hum.  But thinking that makes about as much sense as being ho-hum about Newton vs. Einstein.  That would be like thinking, \\"Newton and Einstein didn't disagree on whether gravity exists, so this is just infighting among people who differ only in emphasis.\\"<br />In fact, Newton v. Einstein matters a great deal--as do the controversies explained in this book.  Just as Einstein's discoveries  made possible many developments we would never even have been able to conceive within Newtonian physics, so the eventual truths uncovered by the various competing research programs in evolution will determine a great deal about our ability to understand and shape our lives.<br />Scientists, of course, are human, and they can want for themselves all sorts of things besides scientific truth, including fame, influence, and the financial rewards of being popular celebrities.  (Science journals do not pay for articles.  Pop venues do. Science books rarely make much money. Lots of pop writing on science does.) Sadly, too many of the scientists, when they turn to writing for popular audiences, grossly misrepresent science, and they sometimes just get mean.  Within the popular press--even the highly respectable sanctums of the intelligentsia, like The New York Review of Books--writers need not meet elementary rules of scientific writing.  Routinely, they don't. They exaggerate their own claims, minimize the evidence for the claims of others, and claim to have proven grand things that every real scientist in the world knows they haven't--and that they don't even claim themselves in their scientific writing!  And they do not necessarily play fair with their opponents.  In the evolution debates, they have basically reduced themselves to insulting each others mothers.<br />Richard Morris does a nice job of avoiding such scientifically useless vituperation, helping us see where the real issues lie and what makes each possibility promising.<br />Of course, anyone who wants can complain about Morris's principles of selection.  Personally, I wish he had not overlooked increased scientific interest in sexual selection, especially since there is evidence to show that the leading way of reconciling it with natural selection is less than clearly true.  But that's really neither here nor thre.  The important thing is that he has made clear what real research within science is about.<br />If you are a lay person who wants a fair overview of current issues involved in our efforts to understand human life, this is a very helpful accomplishment.<br />If, though, you have no interest in understanding how life works, just an interest in priding yourself on already accepting evolution, you will find this book boring.<br />Evolutionary thinking promises to open exhilirating new vistas on our lives.  The new areas of research it has opened even in the last twenty years--which are certainly decades away from yielding conclusive results--give us the chance to understand ourselves and our world as never before.  For those sciences to do their work, though, they need for all of us to understand why they matter, what they may accomplkish, and what they haven't yet achieved.  They need that so we support them and make their work possible.<br />That being said, it follows that Morris has made a contribution to the future of our species--insofar as this book helps people see beyond the cant and mutual ill-will that fills public debate, to understand that evolution is a set of sciences, not a settled body of knowledge, from which we can eventually learn immense amounts.The new areas of research it has opened even in the last twenty years--which are certainly decades away from yielding conclusive results--give us the chance to understand ourselves and our world as never before.

Generally, that review manages to miss the point.  Armstrong doesn't \\"critique\\" Socrates or Stendahl, etc.; he uses them to interrogate our experience of love and finds the kernel of truth they each captured, while also synthesizing these (and many other) perspectives into a coherent picture.  There is nothing murky here, and certainly no failure to think through the positions.  I'm a pretty fierce critic myself, and the clarity and coherence of this book seem to me to pass muster.<br />I picked this up while canvassing possible resources for my students in an advanced applied ethics course, hoping it would help with a section on sexuality.  For that, it isn't to the point-that's not really the topic of the book.  But I'm glad I found it, and I'll be recommending it to students and friends alike as a source of wisdom about love.<br />The question Armstrong sets himself is, What makes it possible for people to love each other, over the long haul, in satisfying ways?  \\"Falling in love\\" rarely lasts, as we all know-the heat of early romance fades when faced with broader realities.  Armstrong points out that modeling love on this transient incandescence means we simply cannot understand how to love-when we try to see enduring love as some sort of dilute form of romantic intoxication, we are trying to make it something it is not.<br />I don't know of another book that casts such a broad net in considering love.  Armstrong understands, as almost no contemporary psychologists or therapists do, the history of human efforts to understand love. Thus, he includes in his thinking experiences, problems, and insights that escape the blinkered views of contemporary ideologies.  A fair number of Greeks, for instance, had some interesting thoughts about love and its place in individual lives and in human relationships.  As I've already mentioned, Armstrong sets these many experiences and insights side-by-side, uses them to interrogate our experience, and takes from each some guidance on his question.  He thus unites his broad understanding of our history with contemporary psychology and sociobiology to produce a remarkably complex, nuanced account.<br />Yet the writing is clear, simple, and engaging.  To synthesize so much diverse, often-subtle material into a complex and sophisticated account, then to write in a style that seems effortless-quite an accomplishment.<br />This could have been called \\"Love's Little Instruction Book for the Highly Intelligent.\\"  Devoid of smarm, rich in compassion, and informed by the best that has been thought or said on the subject across human history-well, it won't be jumping off the racks of the check-out line a Wally World, but it ought to have a honored place on the shelves of every well-educated person.ny experiences and insights side-by-side, uses them to interrogate our experience, and takes from each some guidance on his question.

This is just a bad book.<br />Nyberg believes that lying and deceit are often morally right, and by all appearances he begins indulging himself in this principle from the first page of the introduction.<br />On that first page, he says that the \\"standard view of moral philosophy\\" is that lying is categorically wrong. That is simply ridiculous.  That was the \\"standard view\\" for only a brief time, in a small space-namely, among Catholic philosophers in medieval times. It was not the \\"standard view\\" in antiquity, nor has it been the \\"standard\\" view for the last several hundred years, nor has it ever been the standard view in Judaism.<br />Then, also on page one, he claims that the standard view of behavioral scientists is that normal thinking consists of direct contact with reality, free of distortion,  and claims that any deception is thought to be born of anxiety and symptomatic of pathology. Again, that is simply untrue.<br />By the time Nyberg wrote this book, that 1950s-style view had been roundly proven wrong by well-known research that most everyone in the field considers sound. By the time Nyberg wrote, the ubiquity of self-deception was commonplace knowledge, as was the fact that those least skilled in self-deception are chronic depressives. Furthermore, the views of Martin Seligman and Lewis Beck, among others, had long-since become orthodox--and they certainly make no claim resembling the one Nyberg foists onto \\"behavioral science.\\" Research into \\"optimism\\" had become the trendy topic among researchers on mental health and mental attitudes. And among psychoanalytically-oriented philosophers, \\"narrative therapy\\" had supplanted older ideas, and narrative therapy has never claimed that narratives  have to be \\"true\\" in the sense Nyberg claims.  So, too, the idea of \\"the patient's reality\\" had generally replaced old-fashioned truth as the epistemological standard of psychodynamic care.<br />Continuing on to page two of the introduction, we find Nyberg misleading the reader by claiming that since deceit has an evolutionary function, calling it immoral or unhealthy is \\"disingenuous if not desperate.\\"<br />Not *one single* evolutionary biologist or psychologist would *ever* argue that an evolutionary function serves as any kind of moral justification.  Indeed, the predominant view is that morality serves to check many genetically-programmed activities. (See, for instance, Richard Dawkins' best-selling book \\"The Selfish Gene.\\") The only argument among competent professionals is whether our moral capacity to proscribe wrong actions, whether of genetic or other provenance, is itself genetic or is a matter of culture.<br />Worse for Nyberg, evolutionary psychologists do not argue that what is naturally selected is needful for health.  Exactly the contrary.  A foundational principle of evolutionary psychology is that many of our pathologies result from the \\"adaptive lag\\" between the conditions in which our genotypes developed and the conditions under which we live. Within evolutionary psychology, we assume that the legacy of natural selection is likely to be highly problematic.<br />Since Nyberg uses \\"adaptivity\\" as a recurring theme is his argument, his (at best) failure to know anything about adaptation undermines his argument.<br />The rest of the book is about as sound as the first two pages.  For instance, Nyberg's portrayal of Sissela Bok's classic work is just weird. Just one of many possible examples: Nyberg claims that Bok is a \\"top down theorist,\\" whereas he \\"is interested in particular cases.\\" Now, Bok's method is precisely to proceed according to cases; and she condemns those who ignore cases, saying that to ignore either cases or general principles is to become shallow or rigid. Indeed, most of her book is about cases!<br />Then, in asking why truth matters, Nyberg completely ignores the well-known reasons: that we cannot make reliable plansor sound choices if we cannot count on info we've been given, and that only the truth allows an individual to make his own choices rather than falling prey to manipulation by others (liars) who rob him of his right to self-determination by giving false info.  Instead, Nyberg concocts some fuzzy New Agey nonsense about truth making us feel good in an uncertain universe-a concern not common among advocates of truth telling.<br />Oh-he also portrays advocates of truth telling as perfectionists who long for certainty, which is at best a straw man.  Longing for certainty and valuing truth-telling are by no means the same thing, and the two do not march lockstep through the history of ethics.  And very few critics of lying are absolutists, much less perfectionists,  at all.  He generally portrays his opponents as holding the quirky 1960s \\"Let it all hang out-say everything in your mind all the time\\" notion of truth, which bears no relation to what most opponents of deceit have ever said.<br />And dear me-the things he adduces as considerations in favor of deceit!  The valid ones are not news, and his new ones are mostly bizarre.  He acts as if he were saying something new, and does not bother to point out, or explain, the twenty-five hundred year history of such considerations.  Few moral precepts can lay claim to universality, but the imperative to honesty, with the corollary prohibition of deceit, is one.  As a result, the quandaries posed by apparently-needful deceit have been explored for millennia.

Instead, Nyberg concocts some fuzzy New Agey nonsense about truth making us feel good in an uncertain universe-a concern not common among advocates of truth telling.  <br />Oh-he also portrays advocates of truth telling as perfectionists who long for certainty, which is at best a straw man.  Longing for certainty and valuing truth-telling are by no means the same thing, and the two do not march lockstep through the history of ethics.  And very few critics of lying are absolutists, much less perfectionists,  at all.  He generally portrays his opponents as holding the quirky 1960s \\"Let it all hang out-say everything in your mind all the time\\" notion of truth, which bears no relation to what most opponents of deceit have ever said.<br />And dear me-the things he adduces as considerations in favor of deceit!  The valid ones are not news, and his new ones are mostly bizarre.  He acts as if he were saying something new, and does not bother to point out, or explain, the twenty-five hundred year history of such considerations.  Few moral precepts can lay claim to universality, but the imperative to honesty, with the corollary prohibition of deceit, is one.  As a result, the quandaries posed by apparently-needful deceit have been explored for millennia.

US	52775694	R3FAN6QV1X74FZ	0670031860	846648040	Freedom Evolves	Books	3	33	49	N	Y	Derivative, uninformative, self-satisfied	If you are heavily invested in the professional debate on the question, you need to read this book, of course.  Professional debate is kind of like a sport, and  Dennett is the batter at the plate.  In this book, he's hit the ball pretty hard, even though he's no Babe Ruth.  If you're a participant (or even avid fan), you gotta get in there and pull for your team, whatever it may be! \\"Go, Dan, go!\\"  Or, conversely, \\"Catch it, catch it, catch it-go foul, go foul, go foul!\\"<br />If you don't know anything about the current state of intellectual debate on freedom and determinism, and if you care, this might be a good book to read to get a first-rate state-of-the-art accounting.  Dennett's examples and explanations are clear and compelling.<br />Beyond that, there doesn't seem much point to this book Except for new teaching tools-e.g., from the world of computer experimentation--the book is highly derivative, not a great leap forward.  In the sections directly on freedom and determinism, I didn't see much whose source or precursor in, say, pre-1965 philosophical literature I could not identify.  In the sections on the evolution of morality, most of what he says is overtly borrowed from other people.<br />I remember years ago when my father lost interest in a writer he'd always admired. I asked him why, and he said, &quot;He's run out of things to say.  Now he's just writing books to be writing books.&quot;  This book suggests the same might be true of Dennett.<br />I find Dennett's writing lethargically paced, overly drawn out, and lacking consistent rhetorical snap.  He simply will not use a sentence where a paragraph will do, or a paragraph where he can spin out several pages. The people who marvel at his writing style must mostly read academic or technical documents. To me, he seems like an otherwise-entertaining guy who's altogether too fond of hearing himself talk, so that his entertainment value quickly passes the point of diminishing returns.<br />And I find it offensive that in this book Dennett argues ad hominem so much. If you disagree with him, it isn't that you think he's wrong.  It's that you're scared, you have a hidden agenda, and you are intellectually dishonest-his words, not mine.  I had a hard time getting past the intro, so unbounded is this unseemly behavior.<br />Generally, I think work at this level of abstraction is waste of time and creates but an illusion of knowledge.  I only read this stuff because I inevitably have students ask me about it. (I  teach, among other things, both evolutionary psychology and ethics.)<br />The free will/determinism thing seems to me a useless set of questions, based on conceptual artifacts rather than anything we know about the world.  Free will is a folk notion, and it serves quite well in that capacity.  But no one has ever been able to give an intellectually credible, coherent conceptual account of what it might be or how it might work.  Does that mean it is useless or suspect as a folk notion?  Of course not.  An analogy: Most notions of romance are folk notions, and they serve us quite well within their sphere.<br />Meanwhile, determinism is not a scientific discovery, a necessary presupposition of science, or an implication of science.  Once upon a time it was thought to be all of these, but that is just not so.  We can, and in some areas most assuredly must, do science just fine without any such idea.<br />As a  matter of cold, hard fact, science has yet to discover even ONE deterministic law, principle, or process in human behavior.  We simply, unequivocally do not possess ANY science that supports the notion of determinism in human behavior.  I cannot understand wasting all this intellectual energy debating whether human action is \\"really\\" determined when we've yet to discover any even *apparent* determination within the human sciences.<br />I suspect that such wasted effort really serves a religious function for people like Dennett-it gives them a way to feel confident in the universe.  Support for this contention would be Dennett's boundless, and scientifically unjustified, confidence in his account of the current neo-Darwinian theory of evolution.  I have no doubt that evolution is true. I also know that within science, we have a long, long way to go in understanding how it happens. I also know that even if, in broad outlines, Darwin got it right, that tells us nothing about particulars-including humans.  Get down to the ground level of science, and you'll find things considerably messier and more uncertain than at Dennett's rose-colored level of abstraction.<br />The religious function of high abstraction is to say, \\"Oh, never mind that scientists can't yet figure how to account for all sorts of things-we can be sure that eventually they will discover what I *already* know, that the current neo-Darwinian model is correct. No big mysteries! Hooray!\\" This resting assured within one's beliefs about the universe is what I mean in saying this is a religious notion-a belief that surpasses all evidence, that makes those who hold it feel secure.<br />Along these lines, note that Dennett uses \\"mysterian\\" as an insult-he thoroughly loathes, and often argues ad hominem against, anyone who allows that there may really be mysteries to life, even when they are reputable scientists (e.g., Pinker) who generally agree with him.<br />You want to know how the world works?  Study science and history.  Not these high abstractions.<br />One other thing: Dennett completely fails to understand the idea of \\"the soul.\\" Personally, I am not religious, but I know enough history to know that the main concern of people who insist on a soul is not free will.  The idea of soul does not even *imply* the idea of free will-vast stretches of the history of religious thought insist on both determinism and the sanctity of the soul.<br />The idea of the soul has to do with a longing for what is sacred, a notion that \\"significance\\" lies beyond the \\"vail of tears,\\" that meaning-even life-transcends time and finitude.  Nothing that Dennett says even touches these concerns. He so thoroughly misses the point that he  doesn't even try.confident in the universe.

If you know the landscape, you may or may not find Dennett's contributions worth considering--they are rather less than singular.<br />Personally, I found the book ponderous and shapeless. I already know most of the literature to which Dennett gives his attention, and I found what I gained from his ideas was not worth the time it took to wade through the book.<br />This volume of thoughts has no coherent rhetorical/narrative arch, and it fails as a clear, compelling development of its thesis. Rather, it is the written record of Dennett's tour through all the current controversies that interest him. It's nice to know what Dennett thinks about all these things, but this an unimaginative strategy for producing a big book.<br />Dennett pushes a particular thesis and pushes it hard through every controversy: natural selection as an algorithm that can explain human development.<br />Dennett has an enemy: anything that smacks of making room for any kind of divine intervention. To this end, he even finds the True Believer status of such stalwarts as Stephen Jay Gould lacking. Gould is not just wrong about certain aspects of evolution, in Dennett's view; He is \\"One of Them,\\" someone who, Dennett somehow divines, secretly longs for some kind of miracle. Banish the infidel!<br />Let me say that I am sure the universe, Earth, life, and humans evolved. I have no great interest in theology or religion. I think most stories that claim to affirm both religion and evolution, that claim to make god consistent with evolution, end up with a very feeble God-someone who did a very little work billions of years ago, then basically vanished. That is not the god of religion, as I understand religion. For religion, God must be present and active, capable of intervening in the world.<br />But Dennett's antipathy seems a bit much, to me. He seems altogether too certain, relative to what, in fact, we know about how the world came to pass. Is there any likelihood that evolution is false? No. Is there as much likelihood as Dennett claims that the neo-Darwinian synthesis is basically correct? I don't think so.<br />Dennett proves much too much-so much, that we already have reason to think his boosterism for natural selection cannot possibly be correct.<br />You see, Dennett spends his time and energy on Darwin's *less dangerous* idea: natural selection. But Darwin had two ideas, and the other one interested Darwin himself more: sexual selection. After publishing \\"The Origin,\\" Darwin spend most of the rest of his career on the other idea.<br />Evolution through sexual selection is a very different beast than natural selection. It is whimsical and capricious. It's extremely sensitive to initial conditions, random fluctuations, and genetic drift. It has precious little to do with fitness, though fitness sets limiting conditions. It's unpredictable. Whether you could call it algorithmic would be highly debatable, at best.<br />But it is a powerful explanation for an immense body of evidence-that's evidence, not conjecture or faith or anything else questionable-that most scientists agree is nigh-impossible to square with natural selection alone. (For insatnce, it simply is not true that most scientists agree that natural selection accounts for human culture.) Sexual selection is surely consistent with natural selection, but it is not the same thing, and it explains a lot of things that natural selection can't.<br />That's why in the last couple or three decades, biologists and psychologists-but apparently not philosophers-have begun doing extensive research on sexual selection. (A good account can be found in Geoffrey Miller' \\"The Mating Mind.\\")<br />To illustrate Dennett's \\"excessive brilliance,\\" that is, his proving too much: Dennett goes on and on withthe notion that sexually attractive traits are fitness indicators.  That was a brilliant hypothesis, not too long ago.  'Trouble is, it's false.  (See, for instance, Laland and Brown, \\"Sense and Nonsense,\\" page 193 for a partial listing of the falsifying studies.)<br />For a guy who claims to be so in love with science, Dennett has produced a book that seems to me oddly too full of generalities that science hasn't proved--or that have been disproved.<br />So you see, Dennett-as best I can tell--has managed to prove that an algorithmic view of natural selection is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth at exactly the time when biologists think it can't possible be that.<br />Now, on another matter, as a matter of moral aesthetics, if you will allow me to use that term: there is an unseemly arrogance to this book. As an intellectual, I found Dennett's self-assurance rather embarassing. (Of course, that may be why he has written more books than I have and is much more famous.)<br />I find unseemly that Dennett never allows for the possibility that maybe understanding our origins may turn out to be beyond us.<br />And I find it unseemly that he has decided that religious faith resembling a traditional sort is just wrong without giving any consideration to the sorts of experiences that matter to those who have faith. (I'm not one of them.) No one has ever come to love God because he thought that theological doctrines pose the best hypotheses for scientific explanation. Certain sorts of compelling experience, though, bend even great minds in ths strange direction.<br />Now, Dennett is probably much smarter than I, so maybe he is not arrogant so much as insightful. But I am not able to dismiss the possibility that some persons' religious experience may contain something important that might be beyond my conceptual grasp.<br />Just as my dog loves and understands me up to a point, I may love life and-using all my powers to their fullest--come to understand it up to a point. Beyond that, my gray matter cnnot go, though reality goes much further.<br />Personally, I don't like that idea. But a fair number of estimable thinkers have made this case, and I do not see Dennett producing any argument against it.<br />It is without a doubt logically possible that life, the Earth, and the universe involve forces far beyond our capacity to comprehend. I find it unseemly and boastful for Dennett not to allow that those who recognize this fact lack nothing in comparison to him, in their intelligence and their understanding of evolution.<br />I came away from this book admiring Dennett's prodigious intelligence, but not with any sense that I had learned much to which I should give an immense amount of weight.<br />This book seems to me testimony of what can happen when a brilliant, earnest thinker turns his talents to proving a point. This is boosterism, a polemic, albeit of a highbrow variety.<br />Too bad Dennett became a philosopher rather than a scientist.

US	52775694	R2QNRZF1VHHY2	1583913696	6327069	Patterns Of Infidelity And Their Treatment	Books	1	72	92	N	Y	Baseless and ill-advised	This book depends on a premise that lacks any empirical support and makes no theoretical sense: That affairs are functions of the marriages in which they occur.<br />That an affair has occurred obviously means that the marriage was vulnerable to an affair--that the pattern of marital interaction allowed for an affair to happen. That does not imply that the affair is a function of that pattern.<br />Here's a plain fact:  There simply is no decent research showing Ms. Brown's premise.  None.  It simply does not exist.  And it can't: the idea is untestable, for at least two reasons.<br />First, it is unfalsifiable.  You can always find a way to believe it if you want to.  In every marriage, as in every human relationship, there are always conflicts and disappointments, and if you want to assert that some of them caused a certain behavior, you can always do so.  Like the idea that everything is God's will, the idea lacks any proof in its behalf, but people who believe it can always deploy it to interpret events.<br />Second, the idea is a poorly formed hypothesis in the first place.  The unfortunate notion that affairs reflect the state of the marriage in which they occur is part of a shibboleth of marriage and family therapists, called \\"systems\\" theory.  However, nothing in general systems theory, as understood outside M&F counseling, would suggest that a family is a system in the sense necessary for the theory to apply:  No marriage or family is sufficiently isolated to allow the systemic dynamics, such as they are, to determine the behavior of the components--namely, the family members.<br />Every person is part of many systems--his or her extended family, work colleagues, friends, social strata, local community, larger society, and so forth--all of which have something to do with determining behavior, insofar as systems theory has any applicability to human behavior at all.<br />So the very idea that family dynamics even COULD cause an afffair rests on an indefensible idea.  You simply cannot isolate a family well enough ever to create a test for the hypothesis--and no one outside M&F therapy would ever think you could, since a family so obviously does not fit the initial conditions necessary for applying the theory.<br />Ms. Brown's typology of affairs is likewise lacking in empirical testing.  There simply is no research validating that these are the types of affairs.  And it is ridiculously easy to show that the types of affairs she countenances do not encompass all the reasons affairs take place.<br />Sometimes a spouse is mentally ill, for instance. Sometimes a spouse's early upbringing left him or her with serious ethical lacunae. Sometimes we just marry the wrong people, because we are young and naive or otherwise obtuse when marrying, and the person we marry chooses a dishonorable path. Sometimes we choose dishonorable ways of feeling better because of our own shortcomings. None of those are functions of the marriage.<br />And sometimes an affair reflects the simple facts that affairs are fun and people believe they can get away with them.  The well-known \\"Coolidge effect,\\" that (for the most part) sexual excitement increases with new partners,  is one reason for affairs, and it is part of basic psychology, not a reflection of the marriage.<br />If you try to fit your spouse's infidelity, or your own, into Ms. Brown's views, you may be taking on responsibility for managing someone else's mental illness or moral shortcomings, or you may be shifting your mental illness or ethical immaturity to your marriage, where they can never be fixed.<br />Nothing ever makes an individual trustworthy except his or her own good character. An affair need not show anything wrong with the marriage, but it ALWAYS shows unreliable character--a person who does not keep promises and engages in deceit is (by definition)unreliable. If you are the betrayer, you will never become a reliable partner without reforming the moral callousness that enabled you to use betrayal to make yourself feel better. If you are the betrayed, you make a serious mistake in believing that anything you can do will make your partner more reliable. Yes, you might be able to decrease the partner's unhappiness; but then you will have taken responsibility for keeping the partner happy enough that he or she won't do what they should never be willing to do anyway.<br />In my many years as a therapist in New York, I've seen marriages destroyed by well-meaning but muddle-headed therapists who convince partners that something is wrong with the marriage, when there isn't, really--when some individual therapy or moral education for the betrayer could have saved the marriage. I've seen therapists ratify the betrayed person's broken sense of self by telling them they had a role in bringing it on themselves, thus forever warping their understanding of themselves and of the moral demands of marriage.<br />And I've seen people spend years and thousands of dollars in therapy chasing down mythical \\"system dynamics\\" that there is no sound reason to believe exist at all.<br />Ms. Brown invites more of the same.<br />All in the name of dogma that lack empirical support and make no theoretical sense.abled you to use betrayal to make yourself feel better.

But in fact, this is probably the most helpful intellectually serious book about personality disorders written for the lay reader, and it offers a world of wisdom-if you take it correctly.<br />Taken literally, this book has three major flaws: (1) Its notion of the \\"real\\" self is based on antiquated notions, altogether innocent of any awareness that everyone has many \\"selves,\\" and that set of selves is always in large part constructed by history and culture. Further, \\"selves\\" are in part functions of social situations, not internal organization. The idea of a unified \\"real\\" self makes no intellectual sense, relative to research of the last half century. (2) The old-fashioned psychoanalytic theory grounding this book has little or nothing to commend it, so far as real research goes. While Freud, Winnicott, Mahler, etc., were geniuses, and as probably right about as often as wrong, we don't really know which parts of psychoanalysis are and which nonsense. But we do know, beyond peradventure, that research has refuted or failed to confirm most psychoanalytic developmental theories. (3) Everyone outside of New York and a few other very conservative medical communities has recognized that Masterson's type of therapy just doesn't work. He is brilliant at delineating ways of thinking about personality disorders, but unoriginal and unhelpful therapeutically.<br />All that being said, this book can still be extremely helpful. Ideas do not have to be true to \\"work.\\" The way to appreciate this book is to think of it as a complex system of metaphors-not literally true, but useful tools for looking at a perplexing set of phenomena.<br />Careful observation can lead to useful ways of thinking, even if the terms in which those observations are couched are just not adequate for an accurate science. The terms used for the observations give us useful tools to hold onto what we've observed until we really understand it. The Ptolemaic astronomers, for instace, or the pre-evolutionary nineteenth century taxonomists illustrate this oft-repeated fact of intellectual history.<br />Without such observations, and such ultimately inadequate terms, we would never know enough to get to, eventually, correct understanding. We always have to start somewhere, and collecting data with whatever terms we can come up with is the place we have to start.  Again, the preevolutionary naturalists--a huge number of whom were Christian ministers--held beliefs about the nature of species and the organization of nature that are quite false. By pursuing their observations in support of these false theories, they collected the data that allowed better understanding to emerge.<br />Instead of \\"real self,\\" think, for instance, \\"habits of living that encompass one's biological make up and social milieu.\\" The issue isn't that the BPD has a \\"false\\" self, or that some \\"real self\\" lies underneath. Poor design, not falsity, is the problem. The BPD's habits of living fail to encompass and give form to what's integral to his or her biology, temperament, or talents, within the environmnt in which he or she lives.<br />Any number of \\"selves\\" are possible, given a person's actual make-up, and they may bear litle resemblance to each other. For the BPD, new habits of living must be developed; a new set of selves must be cultivated--but actively, not by uncovering something already there.<br />And don't think of the stuff about early family life as literally, causally true. No research supports that contention; quite the contrary. Seven decades of serious research have failed to uncover correlations between early childhood and adult life.<br />But Masterson has correctly observed SOMETHING, even if hs causal account is wrong. Think of this stuff as a set of metaphors for how the BPD experiences relationships now, in the present. However those ways of organizing one's experience got started, this set of metaphors gives you a way of glimpsing the very strange, agonizing world that the BPD occupies.<br />In my experience, BPDs can improve more drastically and quickly than Masterson knows-but not using his therapy methods. Trapped in the authority-ridden, conservative milieu of New York psychoanalysis, Masterson would never have had the freedom-if he ever even had the inclination-to think about non-analytic ways of treating BPD.<br />This is a helpful book, but not to be taken literally. It provides a set of metaphors that can shed some light, if you'll let them. Read it, but also read Santoro and Cohen's \\"The Angry Heart,\\" which is a much better, more current, more effective guide to getting over BPD.esent.

US	52775694	R2MWCI3KJ82NBB	081269452X	985761287	Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues (The Paul Carus Lectures)	Books	4	73	79	N	Y	Unflinching attempt to address fundamental questions	Many virtue theorists seem to think it enough to say that &quot;qua humans&quot; we should flourish, and that figuring out how to flourish &quot;just is&quot; what practical reasoning is, and hence that virtue is intrinsic to being human in about the same way that having roots is intrinsic to being a tree, and that those of us who fail to &quot;see&quot; that are somehow irrational in wanting some further argument. They skip blithely over the obvious fact that much reasoning that seems quite practical and wildly successful seems rather less than virtuous. MacIntyre indulges in no such self-satisfied question-begging. Whatever else is to be said for MacIntyre's &quot;Dependent Rational Animals,&quot; he displays the virtue of engaging directly and forthrightly the hard questions that unsympathetic or unconvinced souls would pose for his position.<br />The way he argues that we need the virtues is quite startling in originality. Generally, ethicists take as their standard the autonomous, self-sufficient reasoner--where &quot;reason&quot; means something like &quot;able to give a logically defensible verbal justification,&quot; usually in terms of some sort of universal rule. MacIntyre sees this as a mistake. The question, he thinks, is how any of us ever come to be independent practical reasoners and what it means to be such. We must, he thinks, understand that &quot;reasons to act&quot; have little to do with our linguistic ability or capacity to display verbally a syllogism that concludes with the action in question. Rather, &quot;reasons to act&quot; are more concrete, pragmatic, and instrumental.<br />Thus, we can say that intelligent animals act with reasons, despite having no language, if their actions are clearly aimed at ends, especially if it is clear that they choose their instrumental acts on the basis of perceptions of the current environment.<br />*Human practical resoning* begins in this aspect of our animal nature--our ability to learn in practice what we need to do in order to accomplish the things we need to accomplish if we are to flourish. Note that the issue here is learning in practice, and identifying correctly through our practice what we find to be needful for our flourishing. Reason, then, is grounded in the practice of flourishing.<br />And rather than look at &quot;autonomous&quot; adults, MacIntyre points out the obvious fact, usually overlooked by ethical theorists, that we are actually always dependent on each other in myriad ways. Our mutual dependency dictates that we need communities of giving and receiving various things--including education, formal and otherwise--not only to flourish but to be able to know, and reason, about flourishing. Without the virtues, the conditions for practical reasoning *at all* cannot exist.<br />The argument, then, is that our animality and dependency dictate what constitutes both flourishing and practical reason about flourishing, and that we can demonstrate that the virtues are necessary for being independent practical reasoners who flourish.<br />Rather, that's the strategy of the argument. The argument itself is, of course, much more involved. In its entirety, does it work? I'm not sure. I don''t know that everyone would agree with his axiomatic/unargued starting point, that to flourish requires us to be independent rational thinkers, even in the sense of \\"rational\\" he's spelled out here. We of democratic mien see thing that way, of course--but so far as I know, MacIntyre doesn't provide an argument for the overriding necessity of independence.<br />A couple of things are troubling--his apparent reliance on D.W. Winnicott's psychoanalytic account of child development, for instance. I'm not sure whether it really matters--so long as one accepts the notion that persons cannot develop into independent rational thinkers without the support of others, MacIntyre's affinity for Winnicott can be seen as a personal quirk, I think.<br />But that does lead to one perplexity: a lot of what MacIntyre says about the necessities of human life--matters of our dependence--is empirical, in a fairly straightforward sense, more than philosophical. Does this matter? It seems so to me. At least some of his argument turns on empirical claims about conditions for human flourishing for which he provides no argument or evidence.<br />Finally, MacIntyre sees current society as more or less beyond the pale ethically--according to him, neither our families nor our nation states promote virtue or independent practical rationality of the sort he has spelled out. One could conclude, of course, that we live in vicious ands heathen times, so to speak--and perhaps we do. Or one could wonder whether MacIntyre's empirical claims, and the philosophical argument he bases upon them, may not have more to do with his tastes than with the conditions of human flourishing. Is it really so obvious that in our culture we fail to flourish? Taken from the perspective of human history, our developed nation states have a few things going for them that resemble flourishing: the highest levels of material welfare, more equitably spread (in spite of the great distance we have to go in achieving equality); the most widespread education and highest rates of literacy; the lowest rates of infant mortality; the longest life spans; the greatest emphasis on human rights, including for women and minoeriites; the easiest access by non-elites to the arts; the cheapest books (relative to per capita income); the most efficient (if not yet ideal) institutions for international consultation and cooperation, and . . .<br />I like MacIntyre''s version of how life ought to be. I recommend reading the book. But I suggest that one not fail to note that his empirical claims are less than obviously true, while some empirical facts about our flourishing seem to have escaped his notice--or at least been given less weight than many folks would give them.<br />One other thing: This book is badly written.  Never mind the needlessly poor sentence structure in which he so often indulges (and he obviously knows better, since he often writes clearly). But the structure of the argument and its exposition is generally less than transparent. (The reviewer who thought first that MacIntyre had gone soft reflects this fact.) For instance, on page 107, he tells us there are two ways that a certain thing is important, then spends twelve pages discussing the first--without ever getting around to identifying the second, so far as I can discern. That sort of sloppiness is not unusual in the book.

This book fails on both scores.<br />The premise turns on (at least) two absurdities: (a) a Counsel to the President, thirty years married, stupid enough to hang out in a gay bar. A few weeks before an election, no less. Uh-huh. Like everyone in that bar, he knows, belongs to his political party? Like none of them would delight in gossip? Yeah, right. (b) An assistant to said counsel, smart enough and mature enough to have made it to the inner sanctum by age twenty-seven, who-with two years of White House experience under his belt-nevertheless acts with the prudence and judgment of an eighth grader lost in puppy love? E.G., when accused of a serious, serious crime, he keeps to himself that his one-date girlfriend (who could be corroborated at least in part by a D.C. cop) can attest his innocence--because he wants to \\"protect\\" his one-date girlfriend? Said \\"girlfriend,\\" not to mention, having put his life and reputation in danger and acted extremely irresponsibly on that one date?  And whom he continues to protect despite her obvious derangement-and her doing things like drugging him (without his knowledge) for fun?<br />And the resolution is just silly.  The authorities believe the protagonist to be a murdering black mailer.  He proves that two people he's apparently killed really had something to hide--and somehow this gets him off?  Isn't having something to hide consistent with being blackmailed--like, kind of absolutely by defitnition?  Can you blackmail someone who DOESN'T have something to hide?  Thus, the only evidence of the protagonist's innocence is not only entirely consistent with his being the blackmailing murderer the FBI believes him to be, but presupposed by it!  Yet the FBI accepts his story immediately, ignores the massive evidence the bad guys framed him with, and apologizes?  Hey--if p presupposes q, and q is true, that supports, not refutes, p.<br />I'm  puzzled by all the reviewers who say Meltzer's knowledge of the White House is excellent. How would they know that? They would have to know at least as much as he, and compare his rendition with their knowledge. So we have lots of reviews here from White House insiders? Maybe so--but I've had three close friends and a first-cousin in the \\"inner sanctum\\" over the last twenty years, and none of what I know from them sounds like this.ssive evidence the bad guys framed him with, and apologizes?

He argues that \\"conscious will\\" is indeed an important EXPERIENCE, which serves vital purposes; but he denies that ACTS of conscious will CAUSE the actions we believe them to cause. \\"Will\\" is not how I bring about the things I do, but perceiving and understanding what I do--though the \\"I\\" is mostly unconscious, and the causes of actions more or less entirely so.<br />Thus, Wegner does NOT deny that we are the authors of our own actions or that thoughts cause actions; but he denies that \\"will\\" is among the causally effective psychological events. \\"Will\\" is a way of keeping track of which actions are caused by me--by my intentions, beliefs, desires, and so forth. It is an indicator, and a vitally important one, but not more than that.<br />I will be surprised if this this theory turns out to be ultimately correct, mostly because Wegner seems to lack an adequate general theory of consciousness and its functions within which to house and understand will. Consciousness did not arise for no reason--any trait that occurs at a rate above chance must be naturally selected, hence evolutionarily important, and consciousness occurs in about 100% of humans and apparently huge numbers of other animal species. Consciousness could turn out to be just sort of a matter of taste, effectively useless, like the peacock's tail. But that seems unlikely, since consciousness seems to be much more universal that shiny big tails. Conscious will needs to be understood as part of consciousness, and very good science--theoretical and experiemtnal--demonstrates that consciousness has causal efficacy.  (See, for instance, Bernard J. Baars' nice intro to \\"consciousness science\\" in his book, \\"In the Theater of Conscousness.\\")<br />That said, the feeling of willing remains distinct from other elements of consciousness--simply because each type of mental content is distinct from each other type--and thus much needs to be understood about its peculiar traits and function. Wegner certainly points in intriguing directions.<br />Two disappointment: First, and fairly trivial, Wegner knows very well that his theory is very, very far from being established, or even being the leading contender, and he often says so--e.g., that the evidence is \\"consistent with\\" the theory, or \\"suggests\\" the theory, or that the theory \\"would help\\" undertand various things. But being human, he can't avoid slipping into assuming and talking as though his theory is simply right--sometimes calling it an \\"assumption\\" and a \\"realization\\" in the same paragraph! I found the latter annoying.<br />More significant, Wegner sidesteps one central issue: Why does \\"will\\" feel free?  We all know that we sometimes initate actions without feeling free to do otherwise--whenever \\"curiousity gets the better\\" of you, for instance.  Other times we experience ourselves as free to will one thing or the other.  Saying that will is perception of my causing my own acts does not explain the difference--and that difference is one of the main things the free will/determinism debate is about.derstood about its peculiar traits and function.

Indeed, many therapists don't even recognize BPD when it's right in front of them, especially if the borderline is talented (as so many are) at knowing what the therapist wants to see in order to think well of him or her.  Especially when a very smart BPD, having spent a lifetime at pleasing authority figures and cajoling them into the role of caretaker, encounters a rather less smart therapist, the stage is set for a folie a deux, with the therapist ratifying the patient's pathology and falling into something like the role of worshipful caretaker.<br />Thus, self-study is sometimes the best route for the BPD who is serious about getting better.<br />Self-study is always helpful for the BPD, even the BPD who has a savvy therapist--that is, a therapist who does not want to be a hero or the sole source of help.  (If your therapist doesn't like the idea of your doing self-guided study, run.)  For that purpose, too, this book is excellent.<br />The authors have constructed some absolutely brilliant exercises, and they guide you through the kind of structured work that BPD's need in order to acquire inner order in place of their terrified chaos.<br />If you're a therapist who works with BPD's, look at this book as something you might want to suggest that your patients buy and use in conjunction with therapy.  If you are, or have reason to suspect, you suffer BPD, have a look--especially if therapy hasn't worked so well for you.<br />In my experience as a therapist, I found that patients with BPD are often the most intelligent, gifted, and tragically damaged of patients--but that precisely because their inner lives are so chaotic, they are better able to acquire good structure than &quot;more functional&quot; patients who had well-developed maladaptive structures already in place.  Taking apart a long-reinforced structure is very hard, while building from chaos is, in a sense, free of that task.  This book can help with finding authentic structure, in an autonomous process that minimizes some of the dangers of BPD-in-therapy.<br />I have come to believe that two things, not taught in textbooks, indicate whether a BPD can get well: courage and a good heart.  If you have those things, you should never let anyone, therapist or otherwise, discourage you from the path to a whole, integrated life.  If you have those, buy this book at help yourself toward a life free of the horrors of your early days.l-developed maladaptive structures already in place.

It is superb.<br />Now, in one sense, science doesn't have a whole lot to say about ethics--science has to do with what is, while ethics has to do with what we ought to be and do. But to know what we ought to be and do, it helps to know something about what we are.  If, for instance, we are all by nature altruistic and generous, we probably need a different kind of ethic than if we are rather more self-seeking.<br />By looking at the possible evolutionary and genetic bases of proto-ethical behaviors, these scientists and scholars help us get some intelligent orientation on the question of what we are, so far as our ethical proclivities go.<br />To understand ethics, you need to know more than our proto-moral genetic inclinations--you need to know a lot of history, cultural studies, and philosophy, for instance, not to mention religious studies. But in this day and age, you cannot rightly claim to understand the state of the art if you know less. This book is a treasure.	2002-08-03

Unfortunately, I think, it will convince no one not already of like mind--and rightly should not.<br />Foot's thesis is that \\"good\\" refers to fulfilling \\"the life form of the species\\" to which one belongs.  Thus, a tree has good roots if, in the circumstances in which it grows, those roots allow for it to be a good specimen of the sort of tree that it is.  Thus \\"natural good\\" depends on facts about one's species and the circumstances in which one finds one's self--dissolving the \\"fact/value distinction.\\"  To be a good person, then, is to fulfill the life form of our species under the circumstances in which we find ourselves--allowing that there may be many specific ways of doing this very general thing.  As an earlier reviewer noted, Foot maintains that for humans, a certain sort of \\"practical reason\\" is characteristic of our species, since certain forms of life define us and reason must serve those defining characteristics; not to reason thusly is to be defective, in a way analogous to a shallow, poorly dispersed root system in a tall, heavy tree growing in sandy soil.<br />There are many problems with this.<br />(1) Contra to the earlier reviewer, I believe Foot has sleights of hand of her own:<br />(a) Traditionally, the dilemma of practical reasoning is, \\"And what about circumstances in which practical rationality demands that one act against virtue?\\"  E.g., a CEO must maximize profits, despite what that does to the lives of employees and the businesses of competitors.  Foot simply turns it around: She insists that, virtue being normative, to defy virtue is to be irrational. That is, practical reason must fultill the demands of virtue to be rational.  That's nice, but no one is likely to believe it unless they are desperate to do so.  If the CEO goes to his board to explain why profits are declining with, \\"To be practically rational requires one to act in accordance with virtue,\\" do we really think anyone on the board will be impressed?<br />(b) Similarly, her \\"rescuing\\" the notion of happiness turns on distinguishing various meanings of the term, some of which apply quite well to \\"happy Nazis\\"--or CEO's--and the like, but to insist that there is *another* sense of the term that cannot be fulfiilled in the absence of virtue.  Wonderful. And why should wicked people prefer, or be obligated by, this kind of \\"happiness\\" rather than the other senses that Foot acknowledges are real and consistent with evil? Because practical reason must conform with virtue?  And how many people who are happy--though not in the \\"right\\" sense--will find this compelling?<br />(2) At one point, Foot criticizes Nietzsche for constructing a generalizing theory without bothering to observe facts.  Sadly, she does the same, and her argument turns on her so doing.<br />Several very substantial bodies of research today claim that, in fact, our \\"vices\\" are \\"natural\\" and have substantial advantages.  For instance, in evolutionary psychology, infidelity, deception, vengeance, jealousy, and the like seem to have substantial advantages in maximizing the survival of one's genes.  Similarly, in clinical and social psychologies robust bodies of research show that self-deception is characteristic of \\"healthy\\" people, while persons prone to, or suffering, depression are more likely to be truth-seeking and to be accurate in their self-appraisals and appraisals of their control over their environments.  (E.g., in any group, on any desired atribute, about eighty percent of the people believe themselves to be above average, and over half believe themeslves to be above the ninetieth percentile.) And the basic irrationality of how we \\"naturally\\" approach problem-solving is well known, a la Kahneman and Tversky.<br />If these bodies of research hold up, it will follow that \\"fulfilling the life form of the species\\" involves all the vices that ethics is supposed to give us reason to proscribe.  \\"Natural goodness,\\" by Foots criteria, would be very bad indeed.<br />Doesn't it seem, contra Foot, that (if we retain our current notions of virtue) such research fits the old religious idea that our natures are inclined to evil and must be disciplined toward virtue?  Even truth-seeking is not a \\"natural\\" attribute of our species, requiring a good, disciplined (philosophical?) education for its instantiation!<br />(3)  It is hard to see, on this analysis, how ethics differs from mental health, and hence why we should not turn ethics over to psychologists--they, after all, are supposed to know the \\"life form of our species\\" and to identify and address \\"defects.\\"  Yet surely it is obvious that listening to mental health types has been one of the ethical disasters of our century, is it not?<br />(4) These days, no one is \\"defective\\" for failing to instantiate the \\"life form of our species,\\" even on the attributes that Foot supposes we can obviously evaluate as better or worse--e.g., sight,hearing, able-bodiedness, and the like. They are, at best \\"challenged,\\" and allegedly it is only our prejudices that make us think \\"normal\\" characteristics are \\"better.\\" Such views grow out of a body of ethical reasoning that Foot gives no inkling of even knowing--and her blithe assumption that outside of ethics we have \\"natural goods\\" defined by the \\"life form of our species\\" bespeaks some sort of serious blindness to the conditions under which we live today. Her argument cannot even get off the ground in the face of such views, and people who hold them are neither few in number nor floundering at the margins of power.<br />There is value in this book, for those of us who think this way, in that it is probably the most logically elegant presntation of this view around, and it presents it in less than a hundred pages, deftly written.

But this book offended me deeply.<br />Consider this example: Of Black people who believe that their current difficulties have something to do with being the descendants of slaves in a racist country, Pittman says that attitude is \\"not helpful\\" because \\"that was then; this is now.\\"  (p. 33)  Unfortunately for Pittman's pompous pronouncing, a fair body of very, very solid research--represented by, say, Dalton Conley's \\"Being Black, Living in the Red\\"--shows that he is just flat wrong.  And if Pittman had spent some of his career teaching at a historically Black college that serves mostly poor students, rather than treating individuals affluent enough to pay private practice fees, or reviewing the effectiveness of social welfare and remedial education programs instead of reviewing movies, he would have a greater appreciation of how ludicrous attitudes like his are.<br />The same attitude shows itself in his condescension toward a woman whose economic woes probably do, in fact--despite Pittman's preachments--reflect the fact that when she was of an age to undertake professional education, sexism kept her out of medical school.<br />It would be nice if Pittman helped us understand how to deal with the real and dire effects of legacies of oppression, instead of blaming victims for the inevitable disadvantages they suffer.  Of course, if he did that, and really had some experience and knowledge of what it's like to try to help overcome such baleful and ugly effects, he might not be so happy as he so proudly and frequently tells us he is.  He might sometimes suffer despair that, in fact, horrible things are simply beyond the power of anyone to change quickly enough.  (I'm a white guy, by the way--who has enjoyed all the cultural advantages thereof.  I just have some sensitivity to, and experience with, and knowledge of the research on, what oppression does to communities and their members.)<br />Here's another Pittman pronouncement; \\"The rules of appropriate ways to act and treat other people aren't very different from culture to culture, century to century, or even millenium to millenium\\"  Wow.  What have all those cultural anthropologists and cultural historians been wasting their time on?  Why have policy makers been in such a tizzy about what to do over female gential mutilation among certain minorities in ths country?  Why have so many philosophers wasted so much time trying to figure out we can even justify any notion of objective, imperative morals in the face of the extreme differences between moral codes in diverse times and places?  Why do we in America consider infanticide evil, if rules haven't changed much?  Why, in some cultures (even some subcultures within America) is incest considered no big deal, and certainly no one's business but the family, while elsewhere we see it as an absolutely horrid issue that calls for social intervention. Why do we no longer hold slaves?  Why is it no longer honorable for men to take teen-aged boys as lovers?  If Pittman were right, I guess I could go get a harem and some slaves, and some teen-age boy friends, and I could kill off any inconvenient children--since rules of how to treat each other allegedly haven't changed much.<br />Well, these examples reflect the level of scholarship and careful thought contained in Pittman's book.  This book is just dogmatic.  It suggests that Pittman lacks respect for serious scholars and analysts--who are quite grown up--whose views do not agree with his.<br />I'm not quite sure why Pittman thinks people who live other ways than he suggests aren't grown ups, or why he thinks he has, from his therapy room and pop psych advice columnist chair, divined the essence of maturity.  His views just won't hold water, when compared to responsible research.<br />I don't know how Pittman votes, but this is pretty thoroughly a 1950s-style Republican panegyric, a paean to \\"culture is nothing, context is nothing, history is irrelevant, anyone can be happy if he or she just quits whining and gets busy\\" ideology. It is neither well researched nor responsive to mainstream scholarship and research.<br />America's current love affair with self-absorption, served by its hirelings in the psychotherapy and self-help industries, should certainly be opposed vehemently.  But it should be opposed with careful research, sound analysis, and responsible thought--that is, responsive to the respectable views of others, especially more well-informed, others. With its lack of such attributes, this book strikes me as simply an author's self-indulgence.<br />If you are looking for a thoughtful analysis of the ill effects of pop psychology and kindred businsses, if you are looking for a well-informed analysis of how America got so screwy about rights versus responsibilities, if you want to know why it is wrong to put your personal happiness first and foremost in your concerns, if you want a better understanding of how to live as a responsible person in community with others--well, don't buy this book.

Unlike many self-styled or state-sanctioned (i.e., licensed mental health) experts, Ms. Vaughan actually uses more reality than dogma to inform her advice. For instance, her research shows that the leading variable in managing to stay together well after an affair is the willingness and ability to talk (and talk and talk and talk) about the affair for as long as needed to detoxify and demystify it. (Her research also shows that most people trying to deal with the aftermath of an affair find mental health types considerably les than informed or helpful, despite their beliefs in their great expertise. As a trained and experienced psychotherapist, and a well-respected scholar, I can tell you that the mainstream training and professional literature--not to mention self-help--on infidelity is mostly just dogma that mental health types have concocted out of thin air, not anything anyone has actually discovered through research.)<br />I do find a one thing a bit troubling.  As I see it, she does not give due weight to issues of individual moral responsibility.  There are two sides to this.  First, she generally denies that adultery reflects personal failings, placing far more emphasis on social factors to explain why adultery takes place.  She does not produce an argument, so far as I can see, against the idea of personal failings; rather she poses an alternative to that idea.  But to pose an alternative to an idea is not to show the idea wrong.<br />Second, while she is surely right that our culture has come to glamorize affairs rather than condemn them, and while she is certainly right to place more emphasis on this than conventional \\"wisdom\\" allows, it is not all that clear just what causal role social factors play, or which is the chicken and which is the egg.<br />(1) The same social forces act on ALL of us, but only SOME of us cheat. Thus, the social forces cannot explain why cheaters cheat. Differentiating cheaters from others requires looking at variables on which they differ from others, not on forces common to all.<br />2) Ms. Vaughan's \\"evidence\\" that adultery has increased significantly in the last few decades, when sex has become more public and less closeted, depends to a great extent on generally-unrespected researchers like Shere Hite. Her figures on the rate of adultery are higher than others I've seen (and I've read a lot on this subject).  So far as I can tell, we do not really know that there has been a meaningful rise in adultery to accompany the rise in glamorized sexuality (including glamorized icons of adultery).<br />3) Even if there is a rising rate of adultery, and even if it correlates the social forces Ms. Vaughan mentions and a rising rate of adultery, it does not follow that one causes the other. Alternative hypotheses can explain both. One such alternative would be that both are results of increasing egoism and hedonism, which could result from any of a number of factors--consumerism, the decline of Heaven-oriented religious belief, decline of community life, commodity-centered views of the person growing out of capitalist ideology, etc.  Another might be that both reflect the decline of patriarchal social structures. Surely others could be framed.  The point is that we just don't know.<br />I nonetheless think that, on balance, she is the wisest person writing on the subject. Ms. Vaughan possesses good data on the effects of adultery, and she possesses good sense.  She also possesses a crusader's heart.  If, maybe, she goes a bit overboard, as compared to us academic types--well, there never was a successful crusade led by timid generals.<br />I want to add that several months after I read this book and wrote the first version of this review, I called upon Ms. Vaughan for help in dealing with my own situation in dealing with my wife's adultery with my \\"best friend\\" of thirty years.  Quite honestly, I believe she saved my marriage.  My gratitude to her is beyond words.<br />And by bizarre coincidences, it turns out that we grew up in the same place, her dad and mine were fishing buddies, I used to buy gasoline at her dad's service station, my dad preached her dad's funeral, and our lives have run eerily parallel courses.<br />As a result, as you can imagine, I thought about removing from this review any criticism whatsoever.  But I decided not to do so.  I hope my heartfelt endorsement of this book means all the more precisely because I don't simply find it ratifying my own beliefs.<br />I am altogether certain that this book and Ms. Vaughan's counsel did more to save my marriage than all the dozens of other things I read in recovering from the most horrific devastation of my life.uation in dealing with my wife's adultery with my \\"best friend\\" of thirty years.

As a psychotherapist, a writer on psychology well-thought-of in some good circles, and a cuckold (hence my not giving my name), I think I can say that with some authority.<br />I'm not quite sure why therapists get utterly goofy when they start writing about infidelity, manufacturing nonsense about its always being a function of the marriage, or both parties having contributed.  We wouldn't say those things about, say, wife beating, would we?  Why say it about other egregious disrespect, damage, and betrayal of the entire marriage contract?<br />Pittman, with refreshing good sense, shoots down six common \\"myths about infidelity\\" and provides very sound analysis and advice.  Frankly, I would rank this as one of the better pop books by anyone, on any subject, in matters of mental health. His comments on guilt and jealousy are among the best I've ever heard from a mental health type.<br />I have only two complaints:<br />First, Pittman feels compelled to give his own \\"typology\\" of affairs, and while it's better than any other I've seen, it's still artificial and doesn't encompass all the sorts of affairs that occur.  You might not do well to fit yourself into his pigeonholes.<br />Second, like other Americans, Pittman for some reason feels the irrational need to deny that sex is at the heart of the damage done by infidelity.  True, the lies and so forth are horrible.  But let's face facts: We don't get nearly so hurt or angry about lies that have nothing to do with sexual betrayal. I guess Americans don't like talking about the elemental emotions that go with sex, even when we're talking about sex.<br />Maybe I'll have to write a book saying that monogamy is about sex, and what that means, and what it means that sexual betrayal is sexual. Until then, read Pittman's book.  It's very sound.	2002-04-06

For all her good intentions, Staheli puts marriage back into the realm of consumer services.<br />I guess therapists just don't understand ethics--everything has to be self-interest.  You affair-proof your marriage by making yourself essential to your spouse's self-interest, basically.  Good luck, I guess--but what's the point?<br />The point of marriage, I thought, was that your partner would stick by you in good times and bad--not just when you're boosting their self-esteem.<br />Speaking of which, Staheli seems not to know the massive, conclusive research literature showing that, in fact, self-esteem does NOT correlate with behavior.  So keep on boosting your partner's self-esteem, if you want--and I think that's a good thing to do, just because it's nicer--but don't think that will cause any particular behavior.<br />This book contains some good tips on relationships, but it betrays little understanding either of the ethics--and whole point--of marriage, or of current research.<br />The notion that you can \\"affair proof\\" your mariage is just superstition, and this book provides nice superstitious procedures that let you believe you can protect yourself--that is, things you can do to create an illusion of control, which nonetheless actually give you none.  Whether your spouse chooses infidelity as a way of making him or herself feel good is simply beyond your control.<br />What makes marriage an ethical commitment?  You and your partner promise to put each other's interests, and the welfare of the relationship, above your own, rather than seeking self-interest primarily.  You can't make your partner keep that promise by turning yourself into a meeting-his-interest-machine.<br />Love your spouse as best you can--but don't suffer the illusion that this affair-proofs your marriage.

This is well worth reading, as are the first three steps of her program--naming the injury, claiming the injury, and blaming the injurer. From there, it goes WAY down hill.<br />Flanigan says anyone who successfully forgives must come to the conclusion that, in having suffered betrayal, \\"his core beliefs have failed him.\\"  Wow.  The problems with that notion are legion:  To start with, one need not have ill-formed beliefs to be horribly betrayed or injured, and the injurer does the damage, not our beliefs, and those damages do not consist mainly of exposing intellectual shortcomings.<br />Flanigan thinks we forgive by learning that \\"harm is a constant potential,\\" that the sort of thing done to us is just the sort of thing that happens. This book is not about forgiveness at all.  It is about disillusionment.<br />But injury isn't injury because it teaches us that harm is a constant potential, nor are we susceptible to harm because we don't know that.  Every halfway intelligent grown up already knows that.  The entire point of building societies (not to mention houses) and making laws<br />and developing contracts and teaching moral codes and such things is<br />precisely because most everyone, except the very sheltered or retarded, already knows that harm is a constant potential.  That's why we work hard and--contra Flanigan and her disillusioned forgivers-- amazingly successfully to safeguard ourselves from harm.<br />That someone breaches the usually-successful safeguards against harm does not teach us anything we didn't already know about the possibility of harm. Harm teaches us about the injurer, not about how the world works.<br />One thing harm teaches us is that the injurer is dangerous.  He or she does not respect basic obligations, agreements, contracts, or other ordinary protections of civil life.  Forgiving a dangerous person--giving up the anger and caution that keep you on your toes against such danger--is not a smart thing to do.  Flanigan nowhere mentions crucial prerequisites for fogiveness: repentance, remorse, and reform.  Without them the injurer remains someone toward who you should be censorious and inhospitable.<br />If you draw from your injury large conclusions about the world, as Flanigan urges, instead of specific conclusions about the miscreant, you will violate every sound principle of logic, scientific method,and therapy.  If you overlook that injurers, not beliefs, are the problem, you may \\"forgive\\" someone who is not at all repentant or reformed, and remains a danger.g a dangerous person--giving up the anger and caution that keep you on your toes against such danger--is not a smart thing to do.

That does not mean that the affair is a function of that pattern.<br />Ms. Brown's book is more sensible than many guides to dealing with infidelity, though it shares the dogma that affairs are always systemic.<br />And the \\"types of affairs\\" she mentions hardly encompass all the reasons affairs take place.  Sometimes a spouse is mentally ill, for instance. Sometimes a spouse's early upbringing left him or her with serious ethical lacunae.  Sometimes we just marry the wrong people, because we are young and naive or otherwise obtuse when marrying, and the person we marry chooses a dishonorable path.  Sometimes we choose dishonorable ways of feeling better because of our own shortcomings.  None of those are functions of the marriage.<br />If you try to fit your spouse's infidelity, or your own, into Ms. Brown's views, you may be taking on responsibility for managing someone else's mental illness or moral shortcomings, or you may be shifting your mental illness or ethical immaturity to your marriage, where they can never be fixed.<br />Nothing ever makes an individual trustworthy except his or her own good character.  An affair need not show anything wrong with the marriage, but it ALWAYS shows unreliable character--a person who does not keep promises and engages in deceit is (by definition)unreliable.  If you are the betrayer, you will never become a reliable partner without reforming the moral callousness that enabled you to use betrayal to make yourself feel better.  If you are the betrayed, you make a serious mistake in believing that anything you can do will make your partner more reliable.  Yes, you might be able to decrease the partner's unhappiness; but then you will have taken responsibility for keeping the partner happy enough that he or she won't do what they should never be willing to do anyway.<br />I've seen marriages destroyed by well-meaning therapists who convince partners that something is wrong with the marriage, when there isn't, really--when some individual therapy or moral education for the betrayer could have saved the marriage.  I've seen therapists ratify the betrayed person's broken sense of self by telling them they had a role in bringing it on themselves, thus forever warping their understanding of themselves and of the moral demands of marriage.  Ms. Brown invites more of the same.<br />All in the name of a dogma-both partners contribute-that makes no scientific or logical sense.<br />I have about decided that books by psychologists and social workers are the last sources you should consult when dealing with infidelity.

US	52775694	R12RS184BVDIJO	0060928174	691088832	After the Affair: Healing the Pain and Rebuilding Trust When a Partner Has Been Unfaithful	Books	2	168	199	N	N	Odd mix of good info, illogic, and ignorance	This book has some nice bits and pieces, mostly when it reports what patients have said. The interpretive framework, and much of the attendant advice, is shockingly illogical and worse.<br />Dr. Spring says, \\"I don't make blanket judgments about whether affairs are, in themselves, good or bad. What may be enhancing for one of you may devastate the other, and destroy the relationship.\\" That's emblematic of the reasoning in this book: By definition, seeking one's own welfare at the expense of another, violating contracts and promises out of self-seeking, is wrong. That's not even a close call: It is THE bright-line, paradigm, primary-level case of wrong behavior, and has been for a few thousand years of ethical reflection and teaching. Dr. Spring somehow infers from the DEFINITION of immoral behavior a reason NOT to judge? That says a lot about the knowledge of ethics and moral psychology contained in this book. <br />And the dogma that the betrayed of necessity contributes to the affair? Let's face facts: No one can make you drop your pants, or make you decide that betraying your partner is an acceptable way to feel good, except yourself. Your partner can make you miserable, and you have lots of legitimate, honorable ways of confronting that. Your lack of honor, willingness to violate trusts and promises, egoism, willingness to lie--your partner cannot cause these.<br />Another fact: It simply is not necessarily the case that a person who has been betrayed caused the betraying partner any significant amount of pain. The betraying partner's pain, if any is involved, may come from other sources. Furthermore, the betraying partner may have been emotionally unwilling or unable to accept help from the spouse, whether from pride or some other personal limitation.<br />It is also not the case that the betraying partner has necessarily been the one on whom marital stress has been greatest. The betrayed partner has often suffered more at the hands of the wayward spouse, yet had the strength and honor to keep his or her pants on. <br />Despite Dr. Spring's presenting it as fact, the dogma that \\"Both partners contributed\\" is not the result of research. It is not even a testable idea. It is like the notion, \\"Everything that happens is God's will.\\" If you want to believe it, you can always find a way to believe it--it simply is not falsifiable. But it simply isn't something that research has shown. <br />I find myself flummoxed at Dr. Spring's \\"normalizing\\" feelings by saying that since they are natural consequences of the situation you are in, they are normal, not crazy. Now, think about an analogy: The natural consequences of being hit in the head with a baseball bat include concussion, brain damage, even death. Does that make these things \\"normal\\"? Only in the statistical sense-not in the sense that they are in any way healthy. Craziness, illness, disorder, injury-call it what you will--always has causes. It is always the \\"normal\\" result of certain events. That does not make it perfectly \\"normal\\" in anything like the sense of \\"nothing to worry about\\" or \\"healthy.\\" Betrayal does real damage--it causes serious injury. As a matter of fact, not arm-chair pronouncement, in many cases individuals never recover from the causally-inevitable damage that betrayal entails, damage that is often beyond the power of any victim or therapist to fix. If Dr. Spring admitted that, though, she might have to admit that infidelity is just flat wrong.<br />The notions about mental disorders in here are at best debatable. I should know--I wrote a book widely used as a graduate-level textbook on psychotherapy. For instance, in spite of over seven decades of serious research, no one has been able to find correlations between early childhood and adult behavior. Most serious researchers have just given up the idea.<br />I guess when people are devastated, anything that seems to make some sense of their confusion, give them a new and intelligible orientation, and provide a promise (whether well- or ill-founded) of control over the outcome--well, anything like that seems helpful. That's the only way I can understand so many people saying this book helped them. But I find it very disturbing that so many people consider this illogical, ethically-uninformed book admirable.<br />While real research (as opposed to therapists' assurances) on recovering from infidelity is not as good as we'd like, one of the better studies shows that about one marriage in seven actually recovers from infidelity. Nearly half of those \\"successful recoveries\\" come in cases of \\"one night stands,\\" not on-going affairs. <br />But about two in three marriages \\"survives\\" infidelity. About three out of four \\"surviving\\" marriages are seriously crippled. <BR>Chances are, then, that your marriage will \\"survive\\" infidelity, but the odds of surviving infidelity in good shape are extremely small--about one in seven--and in the case of protracted affairs that shrinks to about one in twelve. (Charny and Parnass, J Sex Marital Ther 1995 Summer;21(2):100-15)<br />These figures are for couples who have been in marriage counseling to deal with the infidelity. Before you sign up for marriage counseling to \\"save\\" your marriage, you might want to be aware of these data.	2002-03-21

In the last twenty years, psychologists have finally learned something philosphers proved fifty years ago (at least): that one cannot understand human action without taking into account subjective experience--including emotion.  Nussbaum--contra some previous reviewer who for-who-knows-what-reason says her psychology is &quot;misguided&quot;--knows well the cognitive research on emotions, current psychoanalytic thinking and developmental research, and cutting edge, research-guiding theories.  She is quite clear on exactly what kind of evidence each can boast or not.  She puts them all together and shows us some things about emotion and ethics that, perhaps, psychologists will get around to knowing in a decade or so.<br />(So why only four stars?  The book really needed a ruthless editor.  I frequently found myself saying, &quot;Enough already--you've made your point, so get on with it.)<br />Caution, though: This is a book for intellectuals--in the best sense of the word, namely, those who care to know the best that has been thought or said.  If you're looking for feel-good self-help or goofy metaphysics, go elsewhere.	2002-02-22

The history is interesting and many of the pictures delightful.<br />For the average owner who wants advice and information for raising and caring for the average bulldog, the book is minimally helpful, in my opinion.  No more than a third of the book contains any practical advice at all, and most of that has to do with show dogs.  At most, parts of four or five of the eighteen chapters contain advice useful for ordinary owners--and some of that, like the advice on nutrition, seems woefully dated, while a fair bit has nothing to do with bulldogs in particular and amounts to common pet-owner sense. (Like anybody of normal intelligence doesn't know to take a snake-bitten dog to the vet, for instance.) I can't say that I found answers to more than one or two of my many questions about owning a bulldog.<br />I'd never have bought this book in a bookstore, where I would have seen quickly that it didn't contain what I was looking for.  Still, if I'd paid ten or twelve dollars for the book, I'd have been disappointed not to find what I had expected, but content with the enjoyable parts.  At ... dollars, I consider the book a seriously bad value for me, an average owner.	2001-07-12

I was curious about the formative experiences of the author of THAT book.  Except for that, I don't know that I would have finished this one.  Conley gives sketchy details of all characters except himself--for instance, we get no idea why his father forsook his &quot;artist&quot; identity to take on steady work, though this seems an important event, with which Conley deals in half a page.  Even of himself, he is less forthcoming than it initially seems--for instance, he tells us of his various misdeeds and psychopatholgies, but he does little more than report them.  (&quot;Show, don't tell,&quot; someone should have instructed him.) I found myself frustrating with a pile of, &quot;But what about . . . &quot; questions I wanted the author to have addressed.  (&quot;So what about your Mom's short-lived writing career?  How did that affect her and your family?&quot;  &quot;How did your OCD affect your place in your various neighborhoods?  Did whites/middle class folk deal with it differently than blacks/lower class?&quot;)<br />I think this book is more a set of object lessons in the author's (very insightful) understanding of race and class than a compelling or convincing memoir.  We get the details relevant to the lessons, not those that would make a full-fledged story.	2001-05-08

The book presents no formal data on the groups; we are not given the information needed to assess whether the groups were well formed and well run, whether participants chosen provide a reliable sample, or whether the methods for summarizing the participants' views insure that the book portrays them accurately.  Thus, this book fails the most elementary tests of credibility.<br />A great many of the books' contentions are supported only by anecdotes from Ms. Williams friends and families.  One is left to wonder what evidentiary base, in fact, informs the book.<br />That the book tells more about the author's agenda than her findings is suggested, for instance, by her repeated criticism of young black Americans for &quot;forgetting they are black.&quot;  As she tells it, young black Americans who do not believe their experiences justify dichotomous racial thinking are woefully naive and, in her view, will eventually find that racism pervades America in ways that these black people do not recognize.  This, obviously, is not a finding but a prediction, in which the evidence presented by the subjects--young blacks--is discounted because it does not accord with the author's thesis.  That is, the book contends that young black persons who believe their experiences reveal no pervasive racism are simply wrong.  Why do the experiences of such young black people not constitute probative evidence?<br />Whatever one thinks of the views espoused in the text--whether one finds them an outrage or a courageous revelation of uncomfortable truths--the fact is that this book provides little reason for any careful-thinking person to believe what is said here.	2000-12-10

I began playing pool in early middle age, after I'd been practicing psychotherapy for several years.  Since understanding the mind is my profession, I began studying pool psychology.  Nothing available made any scientific sense--we know enough about the mind to know that the conventional wisdom about &quot;the mental game&quot; is just wrong.  Minds don't work like that.<br />So I began trying to figure it out on my own, using my knowledge of the best current science.  &quot;Pleasures of Small Motions&quot; is the result.<br />If you want gimmicks, don't buy this book.  If you want hocus-pocus or psychobabble, don't buy this book.  However, if you want a scientifically sound understanding of the mental game, have a look.	2000-11-27

Dimasio breaks the mold: Using the medium of a  trade book to raise rigorous philosophical thinking unwelcomed within  science, he provides the finest theory of mind since William James.  This  book is a model of how we ought to be thinking about minds: using both  careful philosophical reflection to know what to make of scientific  information, and scientific information to know which theories we should  even bother thinking about any longer, Dimasio escapes the blinkered (and  misleading) thinking of true-believer scientists and no-knowing  philosphers.	2000-06-12

The information in this bookcould easily be conveyed in a couple of thousand words.<br />Worse, the writing is by far the most pretentious, misdirected, ridiculous style I have ever seen--and I am sure I have read way over 10,000 books (and hundreds of thousands of articles) in my life.  I had a hard time forcing myself to read such atrocity.  The problem is not mechanics--he understands grammar and sentence structure well enough. The problem is empty words, overblown rhetoric, unclear content, and the most bizarre conceit I have ever seen, namely, defining ordinary words in a glossary.E.g., &quot;Characteristics,&quot; &quot;perspective,&quot; &quot;knowledge.&quot;<br />If you can find a buddy who has read it, get him to take ten minutes and tell you about it.

I will not recommend this book to anyone, however.  I would  consider that an unethical insult to their moral intelligence.<br /><br />One can  scarcely doubt the author's sincerity, perhaps not even his good character.  However, no one with any reasoning ability could take this book seriously.  It preaches, dogmatically; it does not argue or present evidence.  Hass  shows no great ability as scholar, scientist, historian, or ethical  theorist.  He seems not even to understand the questions an advocate of  moral behavior (morally) must address if he wishes to (morally) deserve to  be taken seriously. A few aspersions toward \\"liberalism,\\"  dogmatic references to \\"scientific findings\\" that are neither  footnoted nor admitted to be controversial at best, and some flat false  historical claims constitute his argument, which is itself full of logical  holes.  E.g., that \\"Millenia ago, moral prescriptions were not seen as  deriving from external authorities such as religion or social  coercion.\\"  This is simply false, unless Hass knows something no one  else knows that he isn't telling, and his only evidence is a quote from two  psychologists (not historians) who claim, altogether wrongly, that Plato  and Aristotle held such a view.<br /><br />The sort of  ethics Hass would have us practice did not fall into disrepute because of  moral turpitude, but for serious intellectual, economic, cultural, and  social reasons.  Anyone wanting to resurrect them must, if he is to deserve  a hearing, address those serious issues.  E.g., we now hold it the duty of  a CEO to maximize profits; that is his ethical duty to his shareholders.  Hass doesn't seem to have a clue as to the serious considerations that lead  to this kind of view of ethical behavior, which is altogether at odds with  traditional notions of ethics, and which is the same sort of view that lead  to many of the things he simply pronounces morally wrong.<br /><br />In short:  dogmatic, often false premises and logically flawed reasoning. A very bad  book by a (probably) good man.hat lead  to this kind of view of ethical behavior, which is altogether at odds with  traditional notions of ethics, and which is the same sort of view that lead  to many of the things he simply pronounces morally wrong.

Jerome  Kagan of Harvard has spent his life as one of the foremost scientists in  psychology.  Unlike most academic psychologists, he has actually made  discoveries that stand up well to critical inquiry.  Thus, this searing  critique of the poor quality of thought that passes for science in our  beliefs about the mind cannot be dismissed so easily.  Kagan is not only  right: He has the credentials to force anyone with an iota of intellectual  conscience to question claims of &quot;experts&quot; about the mind.  More  important, his arguments show that in this fledgling field, the science of  the mind, the chaff far outweighs the wheat--even among the most cherished  beliefs and most prestigious research.  Clearly written, this book is for  anyone who wants to know the truth about the state of the art in our  efforts to understand the mind.	1999-03-10
