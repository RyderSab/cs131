Well Jay Berry Lee wants a .22 and a pony more than anything in the world, and he just might get them, thanks to a tree full of circus monkeys.<BR> It all started on 60 acres of Cherokee Nation land. The Lees only cow, Sally Gooden, hops the pasture fence and runs away. Fourteen year old Jay goes to find her in the Cherokee River Bottoms, never expecting to see monkeys that would change his life around. Jays finds Sally Gooden almost right away, but instead of taking her home he decides to leave her where she is and explore the bottoms.  Jay Berry and his dog Rowdy, a blue tick hound, were following a game trail when Rowdy smelled something. He chased it up a huge bur oak. Jay looked up and couldn't believe what he saw. In the tree was a monkey. Jay was so surprised he couldn't move or talk; he just stood there and stared at the monkey, and the monkey stared back. Then there was a noise from deep in the forest. A noise that Jay had never heard before, a noise that made the whole forest sound alive. Jay was so scared that he ran out of the bottoms and right to his dad. \\"Jay Berry, your mother wants you to run this list to your grandpa's to fill\\". Jay's grandpa owned a store and was one good trader. When Jay got to the store, he told his grandpa all about the monkey.

But even though her going there was a mistake, she felt like she belonged. Not belonging anywhere since she was a baby Anne was determined to stay. You see, the Cuthbert's asked for a strong boy to help around the farm. But instead got a pale faced little girl. Marilla Cuthbert told her brother Mathew that she had to go. But being the kind-hearted soul he was, he talked Marilla out of her idea and into the idea of letting her stay but only for a little while.  The idea of Anne staying for a little while wore off and they decided to keep her. They had both gotten attached to her but were afraid to tell her. When Marilla finally told Anne she could stay Anne went to explore. She had decided her first day at Green Gables that since she wasn't staying that she wouldn't get attached to it. So if she did go, it wouldn't be hard to leave Green Gables.<br /> Anne made a lot of friends and grew to love the place. But she also made two enemies and their names were Gilbert Blythe and Josie Pye. Gilbert was mean to her and Josie was just plain rude. As soon as Gilbert made fun of her, she got mad and broke her writing slate over his head. From then on the two of them fought about everything. He apologized to her several times, but she was stubborn. When they both wanted to teach at the Avalon School Gilbert gave the school to Anne when it was promised to him. From then on Anne was friendly with everyone, including the rude Josie Pye. But her troubles in life don't end with the book, it goes on through out the whole series. Anne might make a ton of mistakes, but she has her own way of correcting them just like me!	2003-01-02

The thirteen-year-old super genius, Artemis Fowl the third, and manservant, Mr. Butler, have set out to recapture the fowl fortune and rebuild the fowl reputation.<BR> In the book Artemis Fowl by Eion Collen, Mr. Butler is a highly trained defensive tactic system that will kill anything seen as a threat to the fowls.  To add to the chaos Artemis must deal with the changes in his family's structure.  His dad has disappeared and in turn, mom has taken a vacation from reality.<BR>One of my favorite scenes is when Holly defeated the troll (people aren't supposed to see magical creatures). Another scene I like is when Mr. Butler's younger sister, Juliet, tries to wrestle with the pizza boy and then he runs away (which is strange for a 16yr.old girl. The boy was trying to crawl away but he couldn't. He kept yelling \\"Help, help, please .\\"Finally ,when Juliet realized what she was doing she let him go and the boy ran probably all the way back to Pashmina's pizza shop. Then the pizza was now filled with bugs and grass so she started to cry. I think they're all weird.   As you might have guessed the fowl are weird but they're nice.

All the fairies liked to keep their identities a secret, every fairy, except one. That one fairy, Lucinda, puts spells on people that she thinks are wonderful, but truthfully they're not. <BR>       One of my favorite scenes is when Ella runs away from finishing school and attends a giant's wedding. Of course, Lucinda was there and her gift to the two giants was that they would always have to be together. The giants wouldn't be able to be out of each other's sight. While all the giants are mourning over the gift, Ella returned to her home in Frell.<BR>      Another one of my favorite scenes was when after Ella had written a fake letter to Prince Char telling him that she had married someone else, she attended the three balls being held for Char. Wearing a mask she caught Char's attention even though most of the girls had knights walking around looking for a new servant or maid. When Sir Stephen saw Ella he dragged her over to Char where he had her try on the slipper. When it fit, Char told her to marry him. Ella being obedient almost said,\\" yes\\", but then stopped and thought about it, If word of her obedience fell into the wrong hands, she could be forced to kill Char. Crying and tasting blood from biting her tongue, she tried to stop herself from saying,\\" yes\\", then Hattie told her not to marry Char. But Mum Olga told Ella to marry him, then Olive told her to marry Char and then give her lots of money. Ella has a fairy godmother, but who is it?

He is going because his mother and father are divorced and his parents live in two different places.  On the plane ride it is silent as a sleeping baby until the pilot decides to teach Brain how to fly the plane.<br />The kind of plane they are riding in is a small bushplane with easy controls.  The pilot teaches Brian the basic controls like how to turn and how to fly up or down.  Then suddenly the pilot starts moaning and groaning that his arm aches and Brian starts to smell something funny.  The pilot jokes it must be something he ate.  Next, the pilot starts jolting back in his seat and at the next moment, the pilot has a heart attack and dies.<br />Brian now has to pilot the plane.  The plane starts leaning, turns to the sharply and goes off course, but Brian doesn't realize it.  Then the plane starts running out of gas and starts going down.  Brain keeps looking for a lake to land in.  Finally, Brain sees a clearing that leads to a lake.  He flies the plane down, pulls up to slow down, and the plane crashes into the lake.  Brian survives, but the plane sinks to the bottom of the lake.<br />All Brain has left is $20.00, his hatchet, and  a smashed watch.  He finds berries to satisfy his hunger and the lake that he landed in  is fresh water.  Brain realizes he has his hatchet to start a fire to keep warm.<br />Another scene in the book was when Brain encounters a black bear and thinks it's going to eat him.  Brain stands perfectly still.   Next, the bear stands on its hind legs and sniffs Brian.  Finally, the bear just leaves him alone and walks away.  I was on the edge of my seat until I found out that the bear walked away.  How many days will Brain survive out in the wilderness?  Will somebody find him?  This is a great book.  I encourage you to read the rest of the series, which are the books The River, Brian's Winter, and Brian's Return.	2002-12-19

In the book, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" Harry Potter, the protagonist, knows a huge secret but nobody believes him. Not even the teachers at school. In order to prove that he knows the school secret Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, go to the 3rd floor corridor where another door is located. Hermione magically opens the door and inside is another huge suprise! A three headed dog! The dog's paw was over a trap door. Harry, Ron and Hermione go through the door and fall into the devil's snare.<br />  Another favorite scene that kept me on the edge on my chair was when Hagrid had a baby dragon. When the dragon hatches and almost catches Hagrid's beard on fire is a really funny scene. This is because Hagrid doesn't think anything of his beard being caught on fire; he just looks at the dragon and says that he's cute.<br />  The final scene that kept my reading was the scene when<br />Harry and his friends had detention and had to go into the dark forest with Hagrid. In the forest they see a dead unicorn, and Hagrid says they should split up to see if there are any more. Ron and Hermoine go with Hagrid but, Harry has to go with Malfoy, a person he really dislikes. Harry and Malfoy find a unicorn, but there is something with it. There was something eating it's blood! Malfoy ran off to go find Hagrid and left Harry all alone!<br />  If you're really into adventure, I encourage you to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.	2002-12-19

Well, in the book Under the Blood-Red Sun by Graham Salisbury, Tomi and his buds are always under a blood-red sun(the eye of the Japanese flag, during WWII). Tomi is afraid of a war between Japan and the United States. This fierce battle comes to a happy ending, but Tomi is drafted to fight the war. The next time Grandpa hangs his Japanese flag outside he'd better think twice about it because some Americans now suspect anyone who is Japanese. Tomi's family is getting arrested for being Japanese. These happened because Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor during WWII and are taken to an internment camp. <BR>I thought this book was full of action. I liked it and if you like action you'll like it too. Tomi rushes to his mom as she is being arrested. He then also gets arrested and put in a camp for Japanese Americans. <BR> Tomi hates the internment camp and runs from the camp when an officer asks him where his card is.<BR> Tomi's best friend is Billy, and Billy isn't in the camp with him. One example of Tomi and Billy's friendship is when Tomi gives Billy the baseball that he caught at a game. This item is precious to Billy.

Well Jay Berry Lee got the chance to in this book, Summer on the Monkeys, by Wilson Rawls. For Jay Berry's birthday he got an animal trap.

But two of the nickelheads are right there. One of the nickelheads is hanging up-side down from the stall. The other nickelhead investigates the drink and then makes Eddie drink it.

If you walk by, it you can hear hoof beats. He also said that a year later, a wealthy man who had spent the night, drove his car about 20 feet, when suddenly he crashed in the ditch.

The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom is a great book to read.<BR> I highly recommend this book because it tells what Harlem was like and how hard it was to live. The Hiding Place also has pictures of what the camps were like. The book is also a great source of information not because it has facts, but the person who wrote it was actually in a camp in 1942. This book is a true-life experience of Corrie Ten Booms life before, during, and after the war.<BR> In the book the author is trying to tell you that prejudice is wrong no mater what color, customs, or beliefs someone has. She also says to be nice and help people when they are in need. The author is also very religious. She believes that if you are nice to people they will be nice back. She believes that the reason she survived the concentration camp is because she never gave up on believing that she would get out alive.<BR> One of my favorite scenes in The Hiding Place is when they start building the hiding place behind the wall with bricks so the Germans cant find it that easily. The family makes the hiding place in the highest place in the house. The family hides lots of Jewish families from the Germans, but one day German solders show up and raid the Booms house. Find out what the German soldiers find, and take the family to a concentration camp.<BR> Another one of my favorite scenes is when Peter steals ration cards for the Jews and people who need them. He steals the ration cards because during the war the people got less food and supplies then they did before the war. Ration cards are like food stamps but on cards. You can trade in ration cards for food and supplies. Even though Peter knew what would happen if he got caught, he did it because it was the right thing to do besides letting people die.<BR>  The Hiding Place is not only a great book because of the excitement but becauseof the forgiving of one woman to many men who put her and her family down.	2002-12-18

On the other hand, if you love adrenaline and you're an outdoor person this book is for you. Well, in Brian's Winter the sequel of Hatchet Brian, the protagonist, finds himself in such an out of control situation.  On a plane ride to visit his dad in Canada the pilot has a heart attack.  He tries to land the plane himself but he crashes in a lake.  Nearly drowning he swims a shore.  Brian is now bleeding and hurt badly.  He knows he is very sick and needs food and water so he finds some berries.  He lives on mostly berries for a while he estimates a month or two, but now it's winter and his life in the woods are about to change. <BR> It was starting to get cold in the woods and Brian was behind in food and shelter.  He was sitting on a rock when he saw what he should be doing. There, in the water were two beavers sitting in the water preparing for winter. Next, it happened.  Brian got an idea from the beavers to use mud and sticks for a nice warm shelter. If this trick worked for beavers it should work for him... right?  Brian gets started with his idea. First, he got the mud from the same spot that the beavers did.  Then he finds enough sticks to hold up the contraption and finally his house is finished.  The next day, it begins to snow. Then he wakes up and hears it. Some sort of popping noise that sounded like a shotgun. Was it a person?  He gazes out of his fort to look for the direction of the noise and realizes he can't run fast in knee-deep snow.  Brian remembers seeing Eskimos walking on snow.  He thought how they did it and then it clicked they had snowshoes.  Brian made crude snowshoes and also figured that with this ability he could hunt for meat.  Also, he knew he wouldn't last long in the cold so he made a warm fur coat and pants out of the animals he had managed to hunt before.  Finally, at the end of his list was to get more food.  Now, it's time to try his new bow andsnowshoes. Next, he walks into the woods and comes face to face with a buck deer that looks like it has been stung by a bumblebee.

That is what Lizzie, the protagonist, does in the book Lizzie at Last by Claudia Mills. This book teaches you an important lesson, never to change yourself just to be popular or to impress someone. Lizzie is really smart, but she can't be smart if she wants to fit in. So Lizzie pretends to be dumb in math. If I were in Lizzie's place I would act the same because she has special talents that she shouldn't throw away like her poetry. <br />She just can't help herself, and she needs to impress Ethan, so she goes to football games, and changes her wardrobe. Lizzie goes to two football games. The first game Lizzie goes to she is afraid of the bleachers because they are so high. So she takes her mind off of them by closing her eyes and counting seconds in her head. The second name Lizzie goes to she learns what the cheer \\"first and ten, let's do it again!\\" means. <br />It is hard for Lizzie to be cool because her parents are different from all of the other parents, and that's where Lizzie gets it from. Lizzie's mom has long, curly, red hair going past her waist, and none of the other parents have long hair. Lizzie's dad thinks everyone should read the \\"New York Times\\" even if you don't live there. So if you want my opinion, I think you should read this great book.<br /> <BR>If you want to find out what happens to Lizzie, and if she changes, then I would encourage you to read this book Lizzie at Last by Claudia Mills.	2002-12-18

Well I think the Baudelaire siblings miss their parents more in the mysterious adventure book The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket. Their parents died in a house fire when the children were at the beach. The children were forced to live with Count Olaf. Count Olaf is mean, selfish, and makes them sleep in the attic. He also makes them make dinner every night even though they don't know how to cook. Now is that the life you want? Here is a little what the author wrote for you!<BR>* \\"I'm sorry to say that the story shown in this picture in front of you is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say are magnets for misfortune.\\"<BR>*In this short book alone the three siblings encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothes, and a damp attic for a bedroom. I think Count Olaf just keeps them around to get after the family fortune. I don't think he is even related to that family. To get the family fortune he will do anything. For example he black mailed Violet. He said if she doesn't sign the fortune papers over to him he would kill her sister.<BR>*What would you do to escape this unfortunate life? You should read the book The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket if you like the kind of books that keeps you on the edge of your seat!	2002-12-12

It was too easy for nursery rhymes to fall into the rhythm of IT.<BR>She didn't know the Gettysburg Address. How did the Declaration of Independence begin? She had memorized it only that winter, not because she was required to at school, but simply because she liked it. <BR>\\"We hold these truths to be self-evident!\\" she shouted, \\"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\"<BR>As she cried out the words she felt a mind moving in on her own, felt IT seizing, squeezing her brain.

These are the exact words of Leo once he finally got a little adjusted to Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli. <BR>From the day she arrives at quiet Mica High everyone knew she was strange; from the strange hippie type cloths she wears, to her pet rat Cinnamon, to her playing of the Ukulele and the strange things she does. From that day on Leo and his friend, Kevin, wanted to get her on their show Hot Seat.<BR> Finally, the day arrived when she was going to be on Hot Seat. Kevin started asking questions. Stargirl was shy. All of a sudden Leo shouted fire one and the seat turned hot. Stargirl jumped up and screamed. Her pet Cinnamon was running all over the set.  Once they calmed down Kevin asked the first question. Stargirl answered the question strangely but she mumbled the answer. Suddenly it happened. Just like that. Without anyone knowing.<BR> This is a very funny book. You will laugh, you will cry. But mainly you will laugh. I advise you to read this book. It's hilarious.	2002-12-11

That's how Stanley Yelnats felt in the novel Holes, by Louis Sachar.  Stanley was found guilty of stealing a pair of smelly sneakers from a charity center.  Clide Livingston, a famous baseball player, gave these badly odored sneakers.  The judge then sentenced Stanley to a discipline center for stealing Mr. Livingston's sneakers.  What bad luck!<br /> For such bad luck you would think Stanley was under a curse.  He was. His no - good - dirty - rotten - pig - stealing - great - great - grandfather started the curse.  The curse must have been with him after school one day.  These sneakers fell off the highway above when he was walking on the sidewalk.  Now because of this Stanley was sentenced to Camp Green Lake where he has to dig a five foot wide and five foot deep hole everyday, even though he was innocent.  The counselors at Camp Green Lake make the boys dig to build character.  It seemed like they were digging for nothing until Stanley found a gold tube.  To him it didn't seem like a big deal.  To the Warden at Camp Green Lake the gold tube was everything.<BR>  <BR>What could be so great about a little painted gold tube? Stanley wondered.  His friend Zero didn't think anything was great about the gold tube either.  Stanley had been teaching Zero how to read and write five letters everyday because he was homeless and wasn't taught.  Unfortunately, when the Warden found out she was mad.  Stanley was afraid that she would use her rattlesnake venom polished fingernails to scratch him again.  Luckily, she didn't.  Still' he wondered about the gold tube.   Little did Stanley know that the gold tube held a mystery.  This mystery started with his no - good- dirty - rotten - pig - stealing - great - great - grandfather.  A mystery that went back one hundred years ago.  A mystery that has been in the Yelnats family and Camp Green Lake from generation to generation.<br />Holes is agreat novel of mystery and friendship.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a mysterious novel.  It's one of my favorites and will have you at the edge of your seat!	2002-12-11

Well in this book Evan did just that.  He has to baby sit his annoying little cousin Kermit.  Kermit everyday gets Evan into trouble.  Well one day Kermit got Evan an orange soda.  Evan didn't know but Kermit put in his laughing fluid.  Evan was laughing like crazy and couldn't stop but, when he did his head and his throat hurt.  Then Evan decided to use the MONSTER BLOOD.  What will happen next?  Will Evan turn Kermit into some monster or, will his trick backfire and get him instead.  If you want to find out then I highly recommend that you read this book.<br />  I really liked this book because Kermit is a genius.  He is a genius because he has potions to cure problems.  Also I liked the part where he did Andy's math worksheet.  He did it because he loves math.  His parents bought him stacks and stacks of math books.  But when he did it he did it all wrong and made Andy get a 0.  I liked it because he tricked Andy and got it all wrong.  I liked it because he is so underhanded and, I think I am a little underhanded to.  I also liked the part where Kermit kept trying to make his shrinking potion.  He kept trying and trying.  First, it made Evan all blue.  Then, it made him covered with feathers and Kermit was laughing.  Evan admonished Kermit to quit laughing.  Finally, Kermit tried again and gave the potion to Evan.  He rubbed it all over his blue feathers and waited.  He then gave up and said that it didn't work.  Then, he felt tingly inside and poof he shrunk to normal size.<br />  The main protagonist in this story is probably Evan.  Evan is in 6th grade and is a normal kid likes to play outside but everyday after school he has to watch his annoying little cousin Kermit.  Evan also likes sports like baseball.  He has a mom and a dad but no brothers or sisters.<br />  The name of the character, Evan, is determined in this story.  He is determined because he wants to get good grades and always tries to get strait A's.  Evan is also sort of bossy.  He was bossy when he kept bugging Kermit to come out and play instead of playing with chemical.  Evan doesn't like to be inside a lot he likes to be outside riding bikes around the block or playing sports.  Kermit is mostly inside mixing chemicals to make potions.  Kermit is also very good at maneuvering his chemicals.  Evan always reproves to Kermit to stop using chemicals.  Those are probably the most personal traits about Evan and some about Kermit. (the genius.)<br />  I sort of can relate to Evan.  I can understand how Evan felt and why he felt that way.  Evan was a good kid and I liked him a lot.  I liked him because he didn't stay inside all day like his annoying little cousin Kermit.  When Evan was getting really mad at Kermit good for him I am glad that he got mad at him.  But he really can't yell at Kermit because Kermit is very sensible and will cry a lot.  This book was really good and I enjoyed it.  Will Evan turn back to normal or will he stay the same?  Read this book and you will find out just like how I found out I read it.et good grades and always tries to get strait A's.  Evan is also sort of bossy.

Meg Murry, in this book, with her brother, Charles Wallace, at her side, in a search of their father. With the help of Mrs. Watsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, they travel to different worlds in search of their father, Mr. Murry.<BR> Well, they find their father, but in doing so, Charles Wallace gets trapped in the mind of the evil it. Meg, and her father now have to get Charles from It. <BR> I thought it was a very exciting book. I loved the magical science fiction parts. When I read about how Charles Wallace got trapped in by It, that was when I really started getting in to the book. I loved how the author came up with the names of creatures and their talents. She described their physical features so well I could almost picture them in my mind. Now that I have read this book, I wonder if there are really other worlds, other creatures, and battles between good and evil somewhere in the universe. Maybe someday we will find out the truth to it all. We are still looking for answers to this life-long question.<BR> Meg, the protagonist, was very determined. That was one of her greatest strengths, determination. She never gave up looking for her father. When she found him, she thought that he would make everything right, but he couldn't, so he had to leave Charles Wallace behind to get him later from It. She was embittered at her father for not making everything right. She just needed someone to blame. She didn't have many friends. She often got into fights like a hairy-nosed wombat and a rabid mongoose. She got into trouble, talked back to the principal, and got made fun of. This is one of her greatest weaknesses. With her strongest trait, love, she ha to overcome It and free Charles Wallace or he is lost forever.<BR> I could really relate to the protagonist, Meg. She was so excited about getting to her father, when he couldn't save Charles Wallace, her heart turned cold. I feel sorry for her because she didn't know what was going on,she just did as she was told. I liked how Meg was, for lack of a better word, clueless to what's going on. I like that in a character because then I can really relate to them. <BR>  If you want to find out what happens to Charles Wallace and the three mysterious women, read this book. You'll never put it down.	2001-12-06

Well in the book Shiloh Season by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, a boy named Marty has this problem. He worked for Judd Travers` for two whole weeks and kept secrets just to keep his beat up dog named Shiloh. Judd says Marty did not even earn that dog and it still belongs to himself. So Judd starts to drink more and more beer. Then all of the sudden one night he got so drunk he got in an accident. One night Marty and Shiloh were taking a jog down to Dr. Murphy's and he was not home, but Judd was around. They took a rest on a log and right in the middle of Marty and Shiloh a bullet comes flying. Judd! That is all that came to Marty's mind. Was it Marty or Shiloh he was trying to kill? Well if you want to know read this book! It's a great adventure story. I think you'll love it!<BR> I like this book a lot, but I did not like it when Judd killed animals and tried to shoot at people.<BR>I think the book was pretty neat though. When Marty had his mind full of secrets it made me think about what he might do with them. He might tell someone or he might not tell anyone. Then I was thinking of what might happen if he spilled out a secret. What might that lead to? This book kept me in a lot of suspense throughout the whole time I read it. The book has many cliffhangers in it so it makes me want to keep reading. I really enjoyed the book, but that Judd Travers made the book have some horrible scenes that were hard to understand and was uncomfortable to read. That's how I feel about this book.<BR> The main character in the book I read is Marty.  Everything is based on him and his life. He is a 10 year old boy who lives in Friendly, West Virginia. Marty has blond hair and two bratty sisters. Their names are Dara Lynn and Becky. He also has a friend named David. They go to school together and are in the same class. Marty has many traits throughout the book. One is he is a very curious boy who always needs to know things. He is also a very courageous kid. He is always spying on Judd, making sure he doesn't do bad things. Marty is a very caring kid. When his dad thought Judd was hunting in their woods, Marty was worried about Dara Lynn and Becky, but most of all Shiloh. Marty has many strengths. One is he is very good in school. His teacher feels that he wrote a great report but he must use his \\"family\\" language at home and good grammar in school. He also is a very good spy. He goes to Judd's house with his friend David. They were being very underhanded. Marty also has weaknesses. He just barely leaves Shiloh to get on the school bus.  Rarely does Marty ever go to friends house for a long time. Those are some of his strengths and weaknesses.<BR> I think Marty does all the right things! I think Marty loves Shiloh so much that whenever he is not with him he anticipates being with him. To me Marty resents Judd Travers. Everything in Marty's life seems to be very bewildering. During the book everything seems to change my mind. One minute I like the book, the next minute I do not like the book. Marty, a young 10 year old, seems to do quite a lot for his age. He is a very brave young boy to me. I like this book a lot because it makes you feel like you go right inside and the book comes alive. This was a spectacular book! I hope you will read it.<BR> I thought this book was wonderful because it made me think about how hard life could be and that I do have a good life so I should be proud.	2001-12-06

So he had a choice he could go to jail or go to a camp called Camp Green Lake. He chose Camp Green Lake. After a while at Camp Green Lake he got as sore as a person who got beat up all day. When he was finished he got a four-minute shower. This went on day after day. Except one day while digging he found a gold tube with the anisole K.B on it. Then a boy named Zigzag, his friend, gave the tube to the warden. So zigzag got the rest of the day off instead of Stanley. Then some time after Stanley, a boy, had pretended to steel some sunflower seeds. Zero, Stanley's friend, hit one of the leaders with a shovel across the face and ran away. Then Stanley as quickly as he could ran the water truck in to a hole when he went to fined Zero. He found Zero under an old boat that said Mary-Lou on it and then him and Zero went on torts what they thought was the big thumb of God. They finally got to the top of the mountain where the big thumb was. Will Stanley and Zero ever go home or not?<BR>I thought this book was funny. It was interesting at times too. I thought it was funny when Stanley drove the water truck in to a hole. I liked it when Stanley told stories about people like his no good pig steeling great great grand father in between. I thought Stanley was a funny person who had a strange personality at first. He could always see his friends looking over his shoulder when he was reading a letter from his mom. I thought it was cool when it seemed like the author was talking about to things at once.<BR>  The protagonist, Stanley, was accused of steeling some shoes. Another protagonist, Zero, was Stanley's friend. Stanley was as big as a bear and Zero was as good of a digger than any one. Stanley was a frail after digging. Zero was also underhanded and undaunted. Zero had maneuvered digging but Stanleyhad not. Stanley's last name is his first name backward. Zero used to have a mom but she ran away when he was little Zero also did not have many friends. <BR>I liked Zero and Stanley because they had lots of things to share with each other and they did a lot together. To see what happens next read the book Holes.	2001-12-06

Well, 13 year-old Korinna Rehme, the main character in Behind The Bedroom Wall, had that experience.  First Korinna found two Jews in her wall hiding from the Nazi people and Hitler.  Hitler, the ruler of Germany, believes that Germany has a \\"Jewish problem.\\"  Sophi Krugmannn and her daughter Rachel, who is five, are in Korinna's bedroom wall hiding from Hitler.  Korinna is in a club called Jungmadel along with her two friends.  Jungmadel is a club where people insult and tease Jews.  Korinna thinks her parents are traitors, because they didn't tell her about the people in Korinna's own bedroom wall.  As Korinna gets to know the Jews her sympathies begin to turn.  Will the Nazi people find Sophi and Rachel in Korinna's house?  Will Korinna and her family be in danger? <BR> Korinna is trying to keep the Jew problem a secret from her friends and even from her other relatives.  Periodically Korinna tries to tell her friend Eva who doesn't mind Jews.  Thankfully Korinna keeps changing the subject.  Will Eva find out Korinna's secret?  Will Eva then tell Korinna's other friend Rita, who already told on her Aunt?  Korinna's secret is bugging her.<BR> I felt scared about Korinna's problem, because if the Nazi people ever found out about the Jews, Korinna could lead her life into danger.  This is an excellent mystery book and you can't stop reading it.  This book reminded  me not to treat other people differently who have different religions or different skin colors.  <BR> Korinna, the protagonist, has blue eyes, long blonde hair and is kind.  Korinna treats Jewish people like dirt.  Korinna's friend Rita dislikes Jewish people, along with Korinna.  Korinna is undaunted by Jews.  She is flustered that Jews are in her bedroom wall.  Rita, Korinna's friend, trifles the Jewish.  <BR> I like this book because it would be fun to have people in your wall, but not if they are your enemies.I recommend this book to people who like mystery books, because this will keep you at the edge of your seat!  This is a very exciting book!  I enjoyed it and I know you will too.  Will Korinna, her family, and the two Jewish people get caught?

In the book The Incredible Journey John Longridge's two dogs and one cat try to go to their home. When John went on a fishing trip he left them out because he thought they wouldn't run away. First, when he left the red-gold Labrador, the animals' leader, headed down the road. Next, he had a feeling that he was heading the right way. These animals just started an incredible journey.<BR>The old English bull terrier was very weak, hungry and tired. Then on the way he fell and wouldn't get up. The wheat-colored Siamese and Labrador tried to get him up but he wouldn't move. When' a bear cub attacked him the Siamese and Labrador attacked the cub. After a few days he got up and moved on. Later the cat fell down a waterfall but is okay that was a sad part. I liked it when the Labrador tried to save the Siamese because he cared about him. When he left a girl who found him he was okay. The cat's fur was as silky as a silk blanket. Another sad part is when the Labrador goes after a porcine and has needles in the side of his face. A great part is when the animals get back together and rejoin.	2001-12-06

In Camp Green Lake, you had to do this every day for eighteen months!  The holes had to be five feet deep by five feet across.  There was only one rule at this camp: Don't upset the Warden, the person who ran the camp.  She had nail polish that was made from extract of snake venom, which she used to threaten people who didn't do what she wanted.  The Warden scratched Mr. Sir, the person who ran the camp and his face became swollen.  The camp became unsanitary because Mr. Sir couldn't see out of his eyes well enough to clean the camp.<BR>One day, Stanley, a boy at the camp, found a gold lipstick cap, with the initials, K.B. engraved on it.  He wondered what it stood for.  He asked one of the other boys in his tent what to do with it.  They said that the Warden would want to see it.  Would Stanley keep it from the Warden?  Would the Warden find out from another boy what Stanley has?  Well, Stanley did keep it from the Warden, but she has her way of knowing things.<BR>The plot was very well thought up and I enjoyed the whole thing.  I enjoyed it because the protagonist went to very breathtaking places.  He climbed \\"God's Thumb\\", a giant mountain that looked like a thumb.  The plot had a lot of flashbacks and it was like I got lost in time.<BR>Stanley Yelnats, the protagonist, was brave and scared.  The kids in his tent nicknamed him Caveman because he was big for age.  He was brave when he did everything he could to overcome the Warden.  He was scared if the Warden would catch him.  He was always dusty and dirty from working on the \\"lake\\".  One of his strengths was digging holes.  One of his weaknesses was dealing with the Warden.<BR>I feel that Stanley will eventually overcome the Warden.  I like that Stanley never gives up easily, but...when the going gets tough, Stanley gets going.<BR>I enjoyed this book and I hope you will, too.	2001-12-06

In the story A Journey To The New World Remember Patience Whipple, the protagonist, and her family went on the Mayflower over to the New World from Holland.  Most of the book was written about when they were on the Mayflower.  Some parts of the book were really sad, but it was also a very great book!  The reason for the sadness was because many people died on the journey.  <BR> Remember Patience's nickname was Mem.  Mem was easier to say than Remember Patience.  Mem , the oldest of her sibling, was twelve.  Mem's little sister, Blessing, was a baby.  Mem met a girl named Hummy on the Mayflower.  The girls became best friends.  Both girls met Will Butten, Deacon Fullers servant.  He was a clever man.  Will does finger games with the crying babies on the Mayflower, and he actually makes them stop crying.  Mem and Hummy became close to Will.  They were all really good friends.  One day Will got sick, so Mem went to talk to the doctor.  The doctor said that he was not going to give Will any medicine because he did not want to waste it.  The reason the doctor would not give Will any medicine was because he was a servant.  Mem and Hummy looked for another doctor.  When they found one he rushed to see Will.  It was too late he was so sick, but the doctor still gave the medicine to him.  It didn't help, Will died anyway.  Hummy and Mem were so sad.  They made some really nice fabric braids that they put in the water after Will's body was thrown overboard.  <BR> In the book there are a lot of insistences like the part about Will.  If you want to read about these, read the book A Journey to the New World .  I like it and so will you.<BR> In this book there are a lot of things I liked, but the best parts of this story was when Mem was with the Indians.  I like this part because she told about everything that happened.  This book is so detailed and because of details this book sounds so true.  This book is like a real diary.  Another part of this book I liked was when the Mayflower got to Cape Cod and was making their way to the land.  I like this part because she explained about every exciting moment that happened.  <BR> Remember Patience Whipple, the protagonist, was twelve years old.  She had brown hair and brown eyes.  Remember Patience was very curious because she always wanted to wonder off and she was brave to go into the sick house with the sick people.  She also was very determined, she never gave up trying to survive.  In this book she is always sad because everyone was dying.  One of her weaknesses in the beginning of the book was a weak stomach.  She got used to the sea movement in the middle of the book.  <BR> Remember Patience Whipple, the protagonist, was a good character.  She was just perfect for the part she played in the book, A Journey to the New World.  She was not snotty or mean, she was kind and gentle.  She was kind and gentle because she was kind and helpful to her sister, Blessing.  If I was in her shoes, I would not be as calm as her when everyone was dying.  I love this book it had so many details.  I have never read a book so detailed before.  If you want to have the same feeling as me read A Journey to the New World.	2001-12-06

Did you ever feel like you were stabbed in the heart? Catharine Carry Logan did when attacks from the Indians were happening to the Quakers. Catharine and her brother, Thomas were captured and separated from each other, then adopted by Indian parents. Since she only speaks English, she can't really communicate to the Indian people. There is one person that can understand her. That person's name is Snow Hunter. He told Catharine that he used to be an English boy. Catharine thought that the Indians were savages before she met Snow Hunter. Many times Catharine despised the Mother that adopted her. Eventually she learns to like them very much.<br /> Many times she missed her brother very much. She often dreams that her brother was close by. Further in the story she took walks with Snow Hunter. One point in the story she dreams that her brother is sick. So Snow Hunter took her to see him. Sure enough he was sick. Catharine gets to take him back to her camp. Then her adopted mother, White Owl, nurses him back to health. Catharine was so happy she felt like a bird that had just learned to fly when Thomas got better. <br /> I really liked this book because it got really exciting in one minute when you turned the page. Also I liked the way they have a person's thoughts and not just their actions. I didn't like the way she wrote down so much sorrow because then it made me feel sad.  The book really makes you think about all the good things that you have and that they can be taken away so quickly. <br /> Catharine, the protagonist has many traits. Her physical features are she has light dirty blond hair like the color of the gold but a little darker. Catharine usually wears a dress and is pretty active. Also she has blue eyes like a blue ocean. Some of her traits are she is very loving toward her brother, she is very good at doing housework. She can also be very joyful at times or just cry her eyes out. Catharine sometimesfeels insecure at night when she was at home for fear of an Indian attack. Catharine sometimes feels incompetent when she tries long division.  Catharine is determined to get home at whatever the cost, until she really understood the Indian people. Another trait of Catharine is she started her diary, she always writes in it so she is loyal. A last trait of her is she loves her family very much. <br /> <br />If Catharine were a real character I would love to have her as a friend. Why? Because she seems to be a lot like my other friends. Like how she needs help with schoolwork like some of my friends and I need help. Another reason I would like to have Catharine, as a friend is she isn't selfish at all. She is a little whiney I think with long division. Why, because she was saying that she couldn't do it.  Catharine would be a good friend because she isn't a snot or popular.  Catharine likes nature so we might take a walk in the woods, because I like nature too.  She also would be a good friend because she is kind to others.  That's why I would like her as a friend.  I felt sometimes sad, happy and just an everyday mood.  <br /> Hi, my name is Carly R. Fairbanks I wrote this review on the book Standing in the Light.  Some of my physical traits are I have brown hair and brown eyes.  Also I wear glasses.  I don't have braces and sometimes I paint my nails.  I usually wear sneakers, but I sometimes wear dress shoes.  I like to wear overalls and snap pants.  My ears aren't pierced so I don't usually wear jewelry.  My favorite color is purple and green so I wear those colors a lot.  I am 5 feet tall. Also I wear a 5 ½ wide size shoe.  <br /> Some of my features are I like to read suspense stories.  I have four people in my family including me.  I have one brother and no sisters.  Some of my hobbies are doing crafts and trying experiments.  <br />Some of my favorite books are Witch of Blackbird Pond, Anne of Green Gables and Frindle.  Also I like a little fantasy too.  Ilike nature a lot too.  My Dad, brother, and I go fishing sometimes.  One time I even got to bring a friend and she really liked it.  I live in Akron N. Y.   I look forward to reading more good books such as this one.  Happy reading!	2001-12-06

Then Melinda's best friend Colleen invited them to her birthday party. But Bradley has never been to a party before. So he didn't know how to act. Everyone thought Bradley, not a bully anymore, was amusing even himself. They all became good friends again.<br />My response to the story was that it was funny, humorous and unusual. The part that kept me at the edge of my seat was when Jeff walked into the girls' bathroom. Anther was when Bradley said to Jeff \\"give me a dollar or I'll spit on you\\". That is how the chapters end in this book leaving you thinking what will happen next.

San Souci<br />      Have you ever read a book that you were afraid to read because it was so frightening?  For me this book was just like that.  In my book there are forty- five scary stories, but I think the scariest one was \\"Knock, Knock, Knock.\\"  It's about this girl and her boyfriend that were going out to eat, but their car dies.  It was a stormy night and a notice on the radio said that a crazy guy was on the loose, but the had to find a repair shop for their car.  So her boy friend said he would go find one and when he came back he would knock on  the car door  three times.  (spoiler) <BR>       Another spooky story was called \\"A Night Of Terrors.\\"  The story is mostly about a young girl and her dog.  There is another scary maniac on the loose again and the girl is at home with her dog.  She was feeling really depressed and her dog was under the bed.  She put her hand down over the bed and he licked it as always.  Then suddenly a police man burst in the door and told her she had to get out of the house.(spoiler) .<BR>       For me this was a really great book but my favorite short story was probably \\"Knock, Knock, Knock,\\" because it seemed the scariest.  The story I didn't  really like was, \\"A Night Of Terrors,\\" because it was really creepy and kind of sad. (spoiler)  The characters in the story were either dead, scared to death, or completely crazy.  I'm not sure if I want to read this story again, I probably have nightmares or just be freaked out.	2001-11-29

Brian was stranded for more than 54 days, and no one had found him yet, so Brian knew now that he is going to be there for a while. Brian is worried, he has only some food and he knows that it will only last for some of the time. Well Brian didn't want that to happen, so he got out his hunting tools and went hunting. He got some more food for the winter, and then he was all set. He had a sleeping bag, pots, pans, silverware, matches to start fires, and of course food. I wonder if Brian will survive. Ladies and gentlemen I invite and encourage you to read the book \\"Brian's Winter, By: Gary Paulsen\\".<BR>One thing I dislike about the book was when; he found out in the beginning that he wasn't going to be found for a while. Then he thought on how it was going to be winter very soon! If I was he I would be worried too just like him. Something I liked about the book was at the end when he was found. A lot of times when I read books I am always anxious to see what is going to happen in the book, how it is going to end up. When I was reading \\"Brian's Winter\\" I was so anxious to see what was going to happen. All of these events were happening and it was really exciting for me to read this book. <BR>I would describe Brian, different than other people. Brian is determined, courageous, and smart. He is determined because he has a goal to live through this winter and he is determined to meet his goal. Also Brian is courageous. He has lived this long out there, and hasn't given up by being scared or any thing. Finally he is also smart. In the book \\"Hatchet\\" (the book before \\"Brian's Winter\\") he was smart when he was stranded there he didn't know how to start a fire. He tried rubbing sticks together; rocks together, and it wouldn't work. He got so mad he threw the rocks at the tree and they made some sparks. He hit them on the tree again and they made sparks, then Brian got an idea. When he hit the rocks again and put some wood where the sparks were going to land. He was hoping so much that it would work, but it didn't work. Then Brian thought and he remembered that he has a twenty-dollar bill in his pocket and it was his last hope. So as you can see Brian is very smart. I thought this book \\"Brian's Winter By: Gary Paulsen\\", was excellent. I hope you read it and enjoy it.	2001-11-15

Or have you ever seen trained upside-down monkeys that revolt? In this book The Twits by Roald Dahl it happens! Mr. and Mrs. Twits are the nastiest, ugliest, smelliest people in the world. They hate everything except playing jokes on each other! Mr. Twit loves bird pie (with real birds in it!) and training monkeys to do everything upside-down. Mrs. Twit plays the first joke in this book, The Twits and it gets Mr. Twit really mad! The tricks go back and forth between them until Mr. Twit plays the ultimate trick he says that she has the shrinks! (The shrinks is where is your head grows into your neck, your neck grows into your middle, your middle grows into your legs, and your legs grow into your feet!)<BR>Next its time to tell you about the monkeys! Mr. Twit is training his monkeys to do everything upside-down. But alas the monkeys want to go home to Africa. (They hate doing things upside down.)  One day a bird native to Africa, the Roly-Poly Bird comes to visit. Then the monkeys play a trick on the Twits!  The Roly-Poly Bird, from Africa, lets them out of their cage.  The monkeys seize the moment to play the trick.  They take the very, very sticky glue out of Mr. Twit's shed.  (He uses it to catch birds for bird pie on Tuesdays.)  Then the monkeys stick everything to the ceiling in the Twit's house exactly how it was on the floor.  When the Twits come home and go inside they think they're on the ceiling so they stand on their heads and then they get the shrinks, for real!<BR>This book is great for laughs it makes you laugh like a laughing hyena! My favorite part in this book is when the monkeys get back at the Twits. I like this part of the story because I felt sorry for the monkeys having to stand on their heads all day. If I were in the monkeys' position I would have done the same thing! In this book there were some parts I didn't like. One part I didn't like was when Mrs. Twit put her glass eye in Mr. Twit's coffee cup and he almost drank it. The other part I didn't like was when Mr. Twit just lets his wife float away wanting to get rid of her anyway. <BR>Next I'll tell you what the Twits look like. Mr. Twit has a very long beard (he thinks it makes him look wise and handsome but really it makes him look ugly). In his beard are little bits of food from all different meals. Mr. Twit never takes a bath so he smells as bad as Swiss cheese! He wears a plum purple suit everyday. Mr. Twit is horrible at being nice and making friends, (which is probably why he doesn't have any friends). But Mr. Twit may be horrible and nasty but he's good at catching birds and making Mrs. Twit really mad!<BR>Now for Mrs. Twit, she used to be beautiful but then she had ugly thoughts and ugly thoughts make you look as ugly as your thoughts so that makes Mrs. Twit the ugliest person in the world! She's mean and nasty and she hits the monkeys with her cane if they don't do what Mr. Twit says.  Mrs. Twit is as bad at everything Mr. Twit is bad at (which is probably why they're husband and wife!), but Mrs. Twit is a great at cooking (especially worms and birds!).  <BR>I felt different about each character.  I didn't like Mr. Twit at all because he was really mean.  It shows that he was mean when he was going to put kids in his pie instead of birds.  I thought that was really cruel.  As for Mrs. Twit she was as bad as Mr. Twit was because she hit the monkeys.  The only characters I liked were the monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps because they always had hope that they would get free someday.  I liked the book because it was always making me laugh and it kept me reading so that I could find out what would happen next.  That's why I liked the story, The Twits, but you don't have to take my word for it, read the book and find out if you like it!	2001-11-15

Williams   <br />Have you ever read the book BEHIND THE BEDROOM WALL by Laura E. Williams?  It's a good book.  In the beginning Korinna, Rita, and Eva's friend Herr Haase have to go to jail for being part of the Jungmadel.  He was also accused of being a Jew lover.  The German soldiers came to his house and beat him up in the streets in front of everybody.  It was as scary as a horror movie on a Saturday night all alone in the dark. The girls and other people are also being accused of being Jew lovers.  Korinna wants to no why everybody is getting arrested.  The girls learned about it in Jungmadel.    <br />This is a good book. There wasn't a lot of action though.  One of my favorite parts was when Herr Hasse was getting beat up in the streets, in front of everybody.  There was blood on the pearly white snow like on Christmas day. I really liked it when Korinna comes home from school and is looking for her kitten.  She couldn't find it anywhere downstairs so she looked upstairs.  She went in her room and heard a noise, so she looked behind her dresser and she found her cat, but then she saw four yellow eyes.  She moved the dresser even farther and noticed that they're sitting in her own wall were two people wrapped in blankets.  She ran downstairs and told her mother, her mother said,\\" Calm down, come upstairs with me.\\" She told her who they were and why they are there.  They were Jews hiding.  <br />Korinna, the protagonist, is a good kid.  Korinna is a tall girl at the age of thirteen, who has a kitten that she loves dearly.  Korinna is a brown-headed girl with blue eyes.  She goes to a nazi youth group called Jungmadel.  She and her friends go there also.  Korinna lies sometimes.  She tells her family lies about things but then tells her friends the truth.  Korinna does not like the fact that there are to Jews hiding behind her wall.  She just can't take it.  Korinna walks to school everyday.  Whether it is raining, snowing, or if it is 100 degrees F,  Korinna can handle the weather no matter what.  <br />I like the protagonist.  She is a little bit of a liar.  Even though you shouldn't lie she still is a good person.  Not everybody can be perfect. Everybody has to tell at least one lie in their lives.  She likes her friends. She likes to be with them and have them over once in a blue moon.  Korinna is like me because she has dirty blonde hair and I have dirty blonde.  She loves cats and I love cats.  Will Korinna parents sneak more Jews in to the house?  To find out more about Korinna and her family read about her in BEHIND THE BEDROOM WALL.	2001-11-15

My favorite part of the book was when Eddie ran out of the locker room in his underwear. I encourage you to read this book.If you are in 6th grade you will enjoy this, because Eddie was in 6th grade. The lesson of this book was not to make fun of your friends. At first I did not want to read the book, but when I got to the 2nd chapter it was interesting. Eddie had no weaknesses in the book Who Ran my Underwear up the Flagpole. Some personal traits of Eddie are that he is a good worker, nice, and funny. If you want to find out what happens you should read this book.	2001-11-15

I bet your mom told you to put it outside immediately. Well, if you went to the Georges' household, the setting of my story, that is all you would find! Tarantulas, crows, owls, fish, frogs, you name it and you will probably find it roaming freely in the house. Jean Craighead George, the mother and protagonist, was raised to love animals and keep them as her pets, so she brought up her three children the same way. You probably can't believe that someone would keep a skunk as a lovable pet, but they did!<BR> <BR>The only animal you wouldn't hear about in their house was a bear! The Georges even had a pond, as real as one outside, in their house built by their neighbor who worked with cement. Read this book and find out why all the fish in their pond start dying. Find out why they had to get rid of a crow as viscous as a hunting dog, or how they found a baby bird as small as a cotton ball that could fit in a teacup. It is all in the amazing and funny book The Tarantula in My Purse.  I learned a lot of interesting facts from this book, and other times I couldn't stop laughing. This book was absolutely terrific and fun to read! <BR> <BR>I thought this book was amazing! The people in my story instinctively kept wild animals as pets! Even when you had to get a special permit, they got one. I think it is hard enough having just a dog as a pet. I could hardly imagine acquiring so many wild pets and having to research exactly what they need. What amazes me is that it wasn't just their mother that did all the work and research, it was the kids too! They helped out, and researched and cleaned up after their animals. The children would never, not do something because it was too messy or they were afraid. Twig, one of those children, had an owl, Yammer, which was soft, gray, and loved television. One day Yammer was watching television stiff as a board, he fell off his perch. Immediately, Twig picked him up and cuddledwith him just like he was her baby brother!<br />This book taught me to be a little more responsible when caring for my dog. They never complained when caring for their many wild pets. I really thought this was a good book to see how you should be responsible when caring for your pet if you want more and more! <br />The protagonists, a family of four, loved wild animals. One of them was a hard working mother. She was divorced when her children were young, so she had to work extremely hard to keep her children and animals happy. Before Jean Craighead George had kids she would go places and research animals. This family of Jean and her three children, Twig, Craig and Luke all researched animals over the years and knew a lot about them, just by taking them as pets. From the beginning of this story, until the end when her kids left and were now adults, the Georges had over one hundred seventy-two pets! Whether they stayed for a day or a year, whether they were a bird or a snake, Jean Craighead and her family took good care of them.<br />I thought the characters in my book were very different from most people I know. It would take me a lot of time to get used to living in their household. I am not used to having wild animals saunter around my house. The whole George family seemed jaunty. Although they had lots of difficulties with their wild pets, they never seemed to be very solemn or act gravely. Many times, though, I thought it would be fun to play with all the baby chicks, turtles and birds. I liked how the characters got the animals to love them and do all these funny things every time they wanted to play or eat. Finally, I enjoyed how passionate they were about their pets. You never had to tell them twice to play with their animals, because that was all they did! <br />So, do you think you love animals? Well, you should read this book to see how much you could really love animals and find out interesting facts. This book was terrific, it taught good morals and madeyou laugh, it even taught you some cool facts. I encourage you to read this book.	2001-11-15

Then in the morning he took them to a near by relative (their parents had requested that the stay with a relative) their new guardian was called Count Olaf. This man was very cruel to the children. He made them make their own meals and for him and his theatre troupe. They made them a meal and the men didn't like it so they had to make them another meal. Every miring Count Olaf made them a list of jobs to do each day. All of their chores were hard for any child to do.<br />I really didn't like the way Count Olaf treated the children. He treated them very badly. He would beat them if they didn't do their chores good enough. He also supplied them with a very old crummy bed with lumps and the springs were sticking out also. I also liked the way Klaus thinks out his plans to stop Count Olaf.<br />The protagonists, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, all hate Count Olaf. They all try to contact Mr. Poe at the bank but he just doesn't believe that he is that cruel to them. Also they protect their fortune. They never give up with any thing either. <br />The Baudelaire children are brave. The always-out wit Count Olaf in hide plans to steal their fortune. I wouldn't like to be them!

Brains was stranded for more than 54 days, and no one had found him yet, so Brian knew now that he is going to be there for a while. Brian is worried, he has only some food and he knows that it will only last for some of the time. Well Brian didn't want that to happen, so he got out his hunting tools and went hunting. He got some more food for the winter, and then he was all set. He had a sleeping bag, pots, pans, silverware, matches to start fires, and of course food. I wonder if Brian will survive. Ladies and gentlemen I invite and encourage you to read the book \\"Brian's Winter, By: Gary Paulsen\\".<BR>One thing I dislike about the book was when; he found out in the beginning that he wasn't going to be found for a while. Then he thought on how it was going to be winter very soon! If I was he I would be worried too just like him. Something I liked about the book was at the end when he was found. A lot of times when I read books I am always anxious to see what is going to happen in the book, how it is going to end up. When I was reading \\"Brian's Winter\\" I was so anxious to see what was going to happen. All of these events were happening and it was really exciting for me to read this book. <BR>I would describe Brian, different than other people. Brian is determined, courageous, and smart. He is determined because he has a goal to live through this winter and he is determined to meet his goal. Also Brian is courageous. He has lived this long out there, and hasn't given up by being scared or any thing. Finally he is also smart. In the book \\"Hatchet\\" (the book before \\"Brian's Winter\\") he was smart when he was stranded there he didn't know how to start a fire. He tried rubbing sticks together; rocks together, and it wouldn't work. He got so mad he threw the rocks at the tree and they made some sparks. He hit them on the tree again and they made sparks, then Brian got an idea. When he hit the rocks again and put some wood where the sparks were going to land. He was hoping so much that it would work, but it didn't work. Then Brian thought and he remembered that he has a twenty-dollar bill in his pocket and it was his last hope. So as you can see Brian is very smart. I thought this book \\"Brian's Winter By: Gary Paulsen\\", was excellent. I hope you read it and enjoy it.	2001-11-15

Well in the book Runaway a girl named Felicia has powers to move things with her mind. One problem, she couldn't control her powers. So she became a runaway. After he escaped all the tests people were doing on her she went to a town called Shadyside. There she met a boy called Nick and his girlfriend Zan, short for Alexandria. Felicia became runaway because at her old town she killed two people. Zan found out about her secret and tried to kill her. Next her friend Debbie tried to kill her. Do you think she think survived?<BR>           While I was reading the book, I was on the edge of my seat. Everyday I read two to four chapters. When I was reading the book I pictured I was in the book watching everything. Everyday when I was in school I couldn't wait until my study hall so I could read the book. One weekend I stayed up from 9:00pm to 1:00am finishing the book. I absolutely could not put the book down. The book had so much action and excitement. That is what I look for in a book. <BR>           Felicia, the protagonist, is tall, slender, brown eyes, and long brown hair. Her personality traits are nice, caring, helpful, concerned, generous and courageous. She showed she was helpful by helping out at the Burger Basket. She showed she was courageous when the Burger Basket started on fire and people were still trapped inside the building. She went inside and cleared the fire with her telekinetic powers. She has a couple of strengths and weaknesses. Her strengths are that she has telekinetic powers. Her weaknesses are that she cannot control them. They just go off when ever they feel like it. An example is when she was in school, she felt the powers swell inside of her, then they just burst out and a row of lockers began to tremble and books began to slam against the lockers. <BR> Felicia seems like a nice girl. She seems she would help out no matter what the situation. She acted strange a few times but people gotused to it, except for Zan. It seems like she had a lot of adventures. This was a good book, I hope you read it.	2001-11-15

Well, Marty Preston, the main character, has.  He found a dog and named it <br />Shiloh.  Marty wanted Shiloh but Judd Travers won't let him have it. Judd hunts and <br />he needs Shiloh to hunt.  The problem is that Judd beats and kicks his dogs and Shiloh<br />doesn't like it.  Marty worked for Judd so he could buy Shiloh.  Marty bought Shiloh<br /> but Judd tries to kill Shiloh so Marty wouldn't have a dog.  <br /> There are many things in this book that I enjoyed. The part I liked was when<br />David Howard, Marty's friend, scared Marty with a Halloween  mask. A part I didn't<br />like is how Judd beats and kicks his dogs. Dogs or any other animals shouldn't be<br />treated like that.  That is what I liked and disliked about this book.<br />The protagonist  of this book is blonde haired, medium tall, and has a dog<br />named Shiloh. Shiloh is a beagle and loves to play with Marty and his sisters. The <br />personality of Marty is like any other boys. He is determined like when he wanted<br />Shiloh. But, he has a problem telling his dad stories about Judd causing trouble.<br />Marty has a couple of strengths and weaknesses. Marty's strengths are: protecting<br />Shiloh from Judd and protecting himself from Judd. Marty's  weaknesses are: <br />telling his dad what happens. <br /> Marty, I thought, was kind of cool.  He protected Shiloh like I would with <br />my dog. He spends time with his family like I do.  Marty stuck up for his friends,<br />Shiloh, and his family. This book can make you laugh or cry. I'm sure you'll<br />love this book.	2001-11-15

Danielle, the protagonist, thought she was.  When she joined a band called Bad Moonlight, she started to do things that sane humans would not do, like drink blood.  She also drank from a puddle, like a wolf.  She sometimes also ran on all fours.   <BR> So she went to this guy who was supposed to help her get better; to try to get her to stop acting like a wolf or a dog.  But that is not really what he did.  Then Danielle figured out that the whole band, Bad Moonlight, was werewolves, and they were trying to turn her into one too.  <BR> One of my favorite parts in this book was when Danielle was running from all the band members, who were turning into werewolves.  Then, she decided to go to Dr. Moore for help.  That was the doctor that was supposedly helping her get past acting like a wolf.  At first, it seemed like he totally understood what was happening, and wanted to help her.  But then Kit came in.  Kit is the leader of the wolf pack, and part of the band.  He needed a wife when he turned into a wolf, and so when Danielle joined the band, he thought that she would be the perfect wife.  So he asked his father, Dr. Moore, to try to slowly turn her into a werewolf.  So every time Danielle went to Dr. Moore he was really turning her into a wolf, instead of helping her.  <BR> At the end, Danielle did not marry Kit.  She actually killed him.  When she was under the moonlight, were she was to marry Kit, she turned into a wolf.  Only somehow the moonlight told her what to do, and she bit Kit hard in the neck.  That freed all the other group members from being wolves, as well as Danielle.<BR>  Danielle, the protagonist, was very happy at the end of the book.  She was still with the band, and they were great!  Danielle was also very trusting.  She trusted Dr. Moore with everything.  She told him everything about her home life, her wild fantasies, and acting like a wolf.  She was very stubborn too.  She did onlywhat she wanted.  She would not go for a walk with the group if she did not want to.  <BR> I can somewhat relate to Danielle.  I am also very stubborn sometimes.  I always need an answer for something.  I am also very trusting. I tell my friends and parents' a lot, even though I get in trouble for it sometimes. I'm happy, too.  I don't belong to a band, but I have a lot of friends, and nice parents.  <BR> Do you ever wish that you could turn into a werewolf like Danielle did?  I don't think you would want to after you read this book.  Also, would you ever want to have terrible fantasies that seemed so real, you were screaming and crying even when it wasn't real?  Would you want to find dead people ripped to shreds?  All of this happened to Danielle in the book Bad Moonlight by R. L. Stine.  If any of these questions sparked your interests, I encourage you to read this book warily.	2001-11-15

This is what happened to Harry Potter.<br />When he was just a baby, an evil wizard killed his parents.  Harry defeated the wizard, but he got a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt.<br />He became famous for this event, but strange things were happening to him.  Harry is a troubled boy.  I like how whenever he gets mad, something bad happens.  It is weird.  He was running away from Dudley's friends when he came to a dead end and ended up on the roof.  Then he found he was a wizard.  He was told to go to the train station, to platform #9 ¾.  His uncle just dropped him off and he left!  That was cruel.  Harry asked the lady where the platform was.  She said her sons would show him how to go through.  Then a boy started running right at the wall!  He went right through!  I thought that was cool.  Harry made it through okay.  I thought this scene was cool because no ordinary human could do that.<br />Harry is tall, he wears glasses, and he has black hair.  He also has a star on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt.  He is very good at magic.  He also is very smart.  Harry meets a professor named Snape.  He is as sly as a fox.  His is very mean to Harry.  Harry is a good boy.  He always has his homework done.  I think he is a nice person, but sometimes he is mean.  I think that Harry has a lot to deal with, like his homework, and everyone mauling him all over the school.  He also gets yelled at by Snape.If you want to find out more about Harry, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.	2001-11-15

Well, when Chris Palmer went skiing he got stuck in an avalanche.  The avalanche is bigger than a tidal wave.  Chris gets stuck in a snow like fort.  Chris is pretty sure his parents will be there the next day looking for him so he tries to stay calm, but then the next day goes by and they don't come.  Chris is stuck there for a whole week!  During that time he keeps his circulation going by moving his legs in place.  Also while he is in there he eats the grouse he shot before the avalanche.  If you want to know about this great book read Avalanche by Arthur Roth.  Find out what happens to Chris.<BR>   In Avalanche I really liked the part when Chris was daydreaming about his life.  It was really interesting how the author would start the chapter by Chris dreaming and then stop and get back to reality.  I liked when he was dreaming about him playing a game of basketball against his brother, Terry.  I also liked how he was dreaming about the red coyote telling him about his sister Jeanette, that had died when she was a baby.  These are some things I really liked about the book.<BR> The main character of Avalanche is Chris Palmer, a fourteen year old boy.  He has brown hair and brown eyes.  Chris has heart problems and cannot play many sports. Chris Palmer is very jealous of his older brother Terry who plays lots of sports and is number one to his father.  Chris so badly wants to show his dad that he, Chris,  is better than Terry.  He is so jealous that he would do anything.  Chris is a great skier so he decides that he will go to Hidden Valley, a place where no one goes in the winter.  Chris wants to show his father and Terry that he is brave.  So he instinctively decides to go and that is when the real trouble starts!  Chris is really good at school and gets really good grades, but is incompetent at sports because of his heart.<BR> I can tell what Chris felt like and how he must have wanted to show Terry and his father he was really great.  I know I would have felt like that too.  After years of Terry being better I would definitely have been very resentful and angry, too.  If I were Chris I would tell my father that it wouldn't be fair to have a favorite.  I know if I felt like that I would have done something about it.  I might have not done something so dangerous, though.  These are some things I think about the main character of the story.<BR> This is a very exciting book because of its great details.  Will Chris ever get out or will he be stuck there forever?  Read Avalanche to find out!	2001-11-15

Well if you haven&#8217;t, you should ask a boy named Greg how that is.  One day Greg and his friends, Shari, Michael, and Bird, were fooling around, and wandered to the old Coffman house.  This is an old, abandoned, haunted house.  Once the four friends get to the house, they realize where they were.  They all dared each other to go inside.  Strange eyes peer from a high up window, like glowing cat eyes.  Those eyes belonged to Spidey, the Coffman House, housekeeper.  He watches over the house, and keeps all wanderers away.  As the children cautiously enter the house, they soon get lost in the huge, mysterious mansion.  As these four, scared, lost friends, walk around, they find themselves lost in the basement.  Greg, suddenly falls over this stuck out floorboard.  There, they open it, and find and find an old, rustic, camera.  They quietly look at it, and then go on, to doing something else.  When Mike and the others are all dressed up in the clothes they had found, Mike suggests that Greg take a picture of him.  After the photo came out, Mike started down the stairs, to see the picture, and how it turned out.  Suddenly, they all see a big mass flying through the air.  It&#8217;s Mike!  How&#8217;d this happen, they didn&#8217;t know.  After Greg, Shari, and Bird helped him up, they all stare at the photo in disbelief.  The picture had shown Mike falling from the steps.  Mike questioned how the photo came out with him falling, when Greg took the picture before he fell?  None of them knew how to respond.  They couldn&#8217;t believe what they had just seen, and witnessed.<BR>Another day, on Shari&#8217;s birthday, she made Greg bring the camera over.  He really didn&#8217;t want too, because he was afraid that something else bad might happen. When Greg got to her party, she insisted he took a picture of her, seeing as it was her day to rule, her birthday.  As the photo came out, Shari, being so anxious, ripped the photo out of Greg&#8217;s hand, tearing it right in half.  After that, she made him retake the photo, this time waiting for him to show her.  As Greg showed her, her face turned blank, with astonishment.  All four of the friends gathered around, all seeing the same thing Shari and Greg did.  Shari, not in the picture, just the background of where she was, that&#8217;s all the picture showed.  After they continued on with the birthday plans, they headed back into the house.  Someone had noticed something wrong.  Shari missing!  Where was Shari?  Many thoughts rushed through Greg&#8217;s mind: &#8220;What could&#8217;ve happened to her?  Where is she right now?  Is she okay?&#8221;  What would Greg do if Shari never showed up?  Soon the police were at Shari&#8217;s house, and they were searching though everything, trying to find her!  The party quickly ended, and everyone had gone home.  As Greg reached his house, no one was there.  Where were they?  Their new car wasn&#8217;t there either.  What was going on?  Earlier that day, before the party, Greg had taken a picture of the new car, and had just now remembered putting it in his back pocket.  When he pulled it out, he saw it, a photo of their new car, all smashed up.  Still holding the camera, Greg walked into the house, and into his room to find something horrid had happened.  All of his belongings had been thrown about, his room a mess, all torn up.  Suddenly, the phone rang, surprising Greg, causing him to jump.  When Greg answered it, it was his mother.  She told him that his father had been evolved in a serious car accident, and was now in the hospital.  She also said that the new Station Wagon had been totaled!  What would happen next, Greg wondered?  Was it the camera doing all this evil?<BR>After all of this happens, Greg starts getting weird ideas.  What does this camera do?  What do you think it does?  The next day, out of nowhere, Shari turns up!  She said to everyone, that she had just been wandering around in the woods with all of her friends at her party, and suddenly, she was in the middle of the woods all by herself.  Then, this morning, she just remembered waking up in the back woods, and getting up, and going into the house.  That was all that she remembered, and knew about.  It all made sense to Greg at that moment.  He took all of the photos he shot out, and he just looked at them, trying to find out what all of them had in common.  Then it hit him, they were all pictures of what had happened after the photo was taken!  He knew the answer to his question, what was this camera, and what did it do?  It told the future!  <BR>Greg, Shari, Bird and Mike decided that they had to do something with the camera before it did something else to another innocent person.  They had to take the camera back.  Back to the rightful owner of this evil thing.  They had to get rid of it, before it hurt someone else!  Later on that day, the four friends went to the Coffman House.   The thoughts of the camera made Greg think of Spidey.  He wondered if this was his doings, and if he purposely tried to do something to them, to get back at them for taking the camera.  Quietly, and carefully, they all sneaked in the house, as if they were little mice, passing a sleeping cat, and then down to the basement they went.  Cautiously, they put the evil camera back, and started up the stairs.  Ah!  Spidey was at the top, glaring down at them viciously, attempting to come after them.  The children, quaking nervously, looked up frightened to death, wondering what to do, all looked at one another, and ran.  Shoving Spidey over, they all flew out the front door, desperately trying to save their lives.  What would happen next?  What would Spidey do to them, when he caught them?  To know, you&#8217;ll have to read the rest of the book! (...)	2001-11-15

Well in the Book Getting Near to Baby, Whila Jo's family lost a baby sister.  So Whila Jo and little sister went to live with their Aunt Patty for a while.  They had the worst time.  Their Aunt Patty made them wear dresses and she took away their other clothes.  Aunt Patty was always bossing them around and telling them whom to play with.  Whila Jo and little sister go sick of it and then they just went to the top of the roof.  Do you think they will ever get down or see their mom again?<br /> I really liked the part when it told how baby died.  I liked that part because I could picture what was happening in my mind.  Also I liked when Whila Jo and little sister went to bible school and it was lunch time.  They were sitting under a tree filled with ticks. They were biting everyone. It was really funny.  I didn't like when Aunt Patty had her friend over and her daughter.  Whila Jo and little sister did not like the daughter.  I didn't like the daughter because she was a mean person.  <br /> In this book, Getting Near to Baby, Whila Jo is the protagonist.  She is really determined.  Also she is a happy person.
