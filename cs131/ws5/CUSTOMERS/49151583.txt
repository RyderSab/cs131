What do public school teachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?  <br /> <br />This book was fun to read- engaging, interesting and if not necessarily educational, at least entertaining. The economic threads between seemingly disparate subjects as described here are fascinating... <br /> <br />If you are looking for a \\"hard science\\" book on economics, keep looking. But if you are looking for either a fun read, or a fun read built around a bit of economic theory, check this book out. At the very least, it will teach you the difference between correlation and causation.	2005-09-22

In Preaching Re-Imagined he lays out the problem (preaching as we know it is broken- the same people hear the same messages year after year and yet continue to struggle with the same problems) and some of the standard reasons why people imagine preaching is ineffective (the problem is the people, the method, the preacher, the content, etc). <br />Those aren't the problem, Pagitt says. Rather, the issue is \\"speaching\\", that is, defining preaching down to simply a monologue. And a steady diet of monologue is detrimental to the soul of the community- when all the communication runs in one direction, there are unintended consequences both to the speaker and the hearers. It may be fine in the short term, but long term this tends to stunt the growth of all involved.  <br /> <br />Doug advocates something he calls progressional dialogue- becoming communities who listen to the preachers among us, not only the preacher standing in front of us.  <br /> <br />This is a seriously great book that will challenge anyone who fills the role of \\"preacher\\" for his or her community to consider the impact their method may have on the hearers, and to consider from the ground-up the \\"hows\\", \\"whys\\" and \\"whats\\" of preaching. <br /> <br />Check this book out- even if you are at a size as a church where dialogue has become impossible on Sundays, there's much here to glean. This book serves as a wake up call for pastors to once again begin involving the people in the work of teaching one another.  <br /> <br />A quote: <br />\\"As pastor I want to be part of a community where the workings of God are imbedded in all, where the roles of teaching and learning aren't mine alone, but instead are intrinsic to who we are as a people.\\" <br /> <br />Amen.	2005-09-20

In fact, more than just entertaining, this book is challenging- And I love that.  <br /> <br />Buy it.	2005-06-15

This book provides a great vision for the way forward, a paradigm for truly being in the world, but not of it.   The problem, as Staub points out, is that when we really live as Christ did, we'll seem too pagan for \\"religious\\" people, and probably too Christian for the non-religious.  That's okay- the good news is that by being a true friend to your non-Christian friends (not just someone who's being a friend in an effort to convert people, but also not a friend who never influences people spiritually) is what God really wants. Staub walks through the benefits and the pitfalls of this type of living and comes up with some real gems along the way.  Check this book out- it will challenge you in your relationships both with people, and with God.	2005-02-22

I know Ron may be seeing this, so I hope he discerns the big, <br />warm fuzzy, just-kidding-around smile on my face when I quote him here... <br /> <br />\\"Every leader I find in Scripture was sent into the future.\\" pg. 118 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />huh? <br /> <br />I'm not sure I can go along with \\"they were sent into the future with a <br />future-map of just how things were supposed to play out. Some maps were <br />detailed; others were quite vague... Moses was sent with a future map. <br />Abraham was, David was, Jonah was, and Nehemiah was. All of them were <br />sent into the future.\\" <br /> <br />One of the things I seem to see in a lot of books is the desire to read back into scripture leadership, organizational principles and even heroics when it comes to <br />characters that really weren't good leaders, had no organizational <br />principles and really weren't even that good.  <br /> <br />I don't think Moses is a hero... I don't think we can learn a whole lot <br />from him leadership-wise other than by negative example. The older David <br />got, the more corrupt he seemed to be... he didn't end well or <br />heroically. I don't know that Jonah, Abraham and others were given a <br />leadership map so much as just some simple (albeit daunting) commands... <br />without much explanation.  <br /> <br />I guess my real question is this. Ron says: \\"God gave vision to Moses, <br />Jeremiah, Daniel, Nehemiah, Paul and Peter... not to the committees they <br />chaired.\\" <br />Well... okay. But for the most part, the old testament is a very <br />different milieu than that in which we operate with different kinds of <br />leaders. And fairly quickly (Acts 15) I see the church developing a <br />plurality of leadership. Yes-God gave Paul personal vision for his <br />travels. He also spoke to Paul through others... But the church as a <br />whole- it seems very quickly after it's formation they seemed to make <br />decisions as a \\"we\\" not an \\"I\\" <br /> <br />Is it possible that the new thing God is leading us into (to co-opt <br />Ron's terminology) is a flatter leadership structure, a plurality of <br />leaders, less dependence on the man or woman at the top? Less visionary <br />leaders and more visionary congregations?  <br /> <br />Positive- \\"Paul changed methodologies whenever necessary to make sure the idiom, the language, and the  <br />metaphors were all comprehensible and connecting with his audience... Is the church speaking a foreign  <br />language or the language of its times?\\" <br />To me, that's the real heart of relevancy- is it accessible. Not is it enjoyable, entertaining, or whatever, but is it  <br />even understandable.  <br /> <br />Not so positive: \\"Leaders are the ones responsible for the flavor, feel and direction  <br />of the local church. If the leaders aren't healthy, learning, dreaming, praying and creative individuals, then how  <br />are we to expect the church to be any of those things?\\" <br />Why do the leaders determine the flavor, the feel and direction of the  <br />church? What if we told the people that those things were their job, and we leaders would teach,  <br />shepherd and pray? I know it's often a defacto thing that leaders do it all, but does it have to be that way?  <br /> <br />a good book- some good insights... but I fear it ultimately embraces an old paradigm for leadership.	2004-11-08

He's known for creative thinking about  future ways of doing and being church... and here he doesn't disappoint.    But this is different than his other books...  more personal and confessional. In \\"Out of the Question\\" Sweet challenges us to get back to what really matters- not powerpoint and multimedia, not propositions and mission statements... but relationships; with God and with each other.     Sweet challenges how we look at everything from treasured Bible characters to our own ideas of faith and belief. It's a wild ride, but worth it.    If you have any of his other books (or even if you don't) pick this one up too. It represents an important contribution to the emergent conversation and a subtle refocusing away from methodologies and propositional belief and back to relationship.	2004-10-26

I've enjoyed and found useful other books from this series, but when it comes to Ecclesiastes, I think Wiersbe may be missing something.  <br />Much of Christianity is enamored with \\"positive thinking\\" and putting the best \\"Yes, but Jesus Loves Us\\" spin they can on everything. <br />Ecclesiastes is a great antidote to that attitude... which may be exactly why so few pastors preach the book and so many commentators have difficulty with it.  <br />The book is not encouraging by any stretch of the imagination, and yet, Wiersbe wants to read it that way. <br />His understanding of the text is fine, the book provides much useful application, but it fails to enter the mindset of the writer... and if you can't see things from the author's perspective, you're probably going to miss some things.  <br />It's a good, short commentary, but I can only recommend it with reservations. Balance it with something a bit less upbeat.	2004-10-14

In that this book represents a description of what some in the emerging church movement are doing to do/and be church in a way that makes sense to the people they are living their lives with, loving with all their hearts and trying to reach, it's great. Karen Ward's essay in particular stands out. Also in that some of these essays contain good thoughts about building churches around the right type of missional thinking, it's great.    In that some of these essays were written with the mindset of correcting the emerging church movement, it falls down a bit. Every movement needs some course corrections now and again. However, the suggestions offered here might have been better made 5 years ago... in particular, the criticism of \\"cool\\" churches.    What's interesting to me is knowing some of the back story here and reading between the lines of some of this. In our ever-advancing line of \\"what's chic\\"... it's now the ultimate in cool to deride coolness in churches. Which is funny. I am deeply invested in the emerging church movement, and have been watching the growing tide of criticism with interest. Especially when it comes from former pioneers, like Mark Driscoll.    I'll give it to Bill Hybels (founder of mega-church Willow Creek). He got criticized but knew where he was going, let the criticism roll off and just did what he felt like God wanted him to do. That's kind of what I feel like right now in regards to the emerging church. These guys like Driscoll (who wrote one of the essays in this book) can criticize us for critiqueing the institutional church (thus creating this nice merry-go-round of criticism and doing exactly what they are telling me not to do)...  but I am convinced this is an absolutely necessary discussion which will be valuable to the church in its doctrine of church,  of Scripture, salvation, and its preaching and other methodologies.     It's the ultimate in indie-cool hypocrisy to set oneself apart as being \\"not cool\\" and point fingers at \\"those\\" guys for \\"trying too hard.\\"    Yes- I have met people doing church who are trying a little too hard to be cool. But to be honest, very few of them are emerging church planters. Most people I have met who have actually reached the stage of stepping out and planting a church have moved past just wanting to do something cool... way past it, in fact- to the point that what I hear more of is \\"This is the only thing I can do- it no longer makes sense to me or the people I'm trying to reach to be church any other way. If I don't do this, I'm not sure I'll even be a Christian in 5 years.\\" This is about way more than coolness and to not acknowledge that is insulting.    So- apologies to Mark Driscoll... but I hope he reads Karen Ward's chapter and gets back in touch a bit with the way he was actually feeling when he started Mars Hill, not just the way he now talks about that time.    It's a book worth the read, especially if you are either:  a. considering dropping out of church altogether and wondering if there are any church communities anywhere that would make sense to you. There are!  b. Considering taking part in a church plant. There's some good discussion in this book which will help guide you as you deal with issues of values, form/style and community.	2004-10-07

In A Generous Orthodoxy, he puts into well-written words the desire of many in the emerging church to draw the best from a wide variety of traditions and streams within Christianity, while still remaining orthodox (and as for one reviewer's comments that McLaren claims the bible alone isn't adaquate for guidance on spiritual matters, Jesus Christ alone isn't sufficient for salvation, and we need more than God's grace to get us into heaven- hogwash. He either didn't read carefully or intentionally misrepresented what was actually a well stated-critique of reductionism- not a statement on any of the mentioned theological matters).

Our community worked through the issue of women in leadership and found this book an extreme help- I've bought it for my elders/pastors and recommended it to many people.     Sumner, with a high view of scripture, takes both the egalitarians (women can fill any role in the church/no difference whatsoever between the sexes) and the complementarians (women can fill any role in the church but pastor or elder/creation order determines roles) to task. Both sides have much to learn from this book.     Contrary to some reviews, it's not fuzzy. It's simply non-linear. I seriously doubt Sumner would consider herself a \\"postmodern,\\" but in many ways she writes like one, introducing a subject, moving on to another relevent issue, circling back to the first subject... the book reads like a series of circles, but ultimately gets us where we need to be- a discussion of the biblical texts dealing with women in ministry. It was amazing to realize that something I was reading had been \\"set up\\" by something else 2 chapters earlier. I can see how if you want a straight-forward, scholarly approach this would be maddening, but it was one of the things that helped make this book so appealing to me.     This book was instrumental in helping me reassess my position on this issue. If you want a biblical framework for thinking through the issues of headship, women in leadership and interpretation of tough passages like 1 Timothy 2, this is an excellent book.	2004-09-16

Don't.    Buy this short, inexpensive book for everyone in your church and tell them not to come back until they've read it.     They will be given a view of evangelism that's actually beautiful (a cooperative dance where we learn form each other while giving people a place to belong before they believe) to replace the old, rather intimidating paradigm (argue people into submission, bludgeon them with your logic until they cry \\"Lord!\\")    If you and your people will grab hold of the simple concepts for community in this book, I think you'll see a vibrancy and life that you'd always wished for.	2004-09-16

If I had to pick just one book to recommend to a Christian leader who is finding that the \\"way we have always done it\\" just isn't working or even making sense anymore it would be this book. Absolutely revolutionary. Yes, there are things that Brian picks up that I may choose not to, but that's part of the point! We need to get back to majoring on the majors and allowing good, healthy dialogue and debate on other things. Wouldn't that be a great witness to a world that is wondering about Christianity to see us dialogue, disagree and still sit in the same pew (or row, or couch) with one another????<br />We have buried Jesus under a heap of trivialities, and the Church on the other side will begin to dig Him out. As regards betraying the Reformation (as one other reviewer accused McLaren)... In the words of Doug Pagitt, an Emergent leader from the Mid-west, \\"If you want to honor the Reformers, don't say what they said- do what they did!\\" McLaren starts us down that hard, but very exciting road.	2003-12-30
