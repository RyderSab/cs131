Reddy has a terrific way with words that makes you laugh out loud, chuckle later and be charmed by even the most awful moments of Reddy's life. Okay, so it's over the top in some places, but isn't that's why you buy a book like this-- to have some fun with what may be happening (or not happening) in your own life. Even if you don't have kids - you'll wonder how she does it. Want to know the secret???? She fakes it some of the time. BUT you'll have to get the book to see how she makes quiche and other goodies, keeps a perfect house and an adoring husband and children that shine. I wouldn't dare violate the confidentiality and trust that author Pearson seems to demand from her readers who are let into the secret world of Kate Reddy working mother and super heroine. Can't wait to see the movie. Who's going to play her -- that's the big question. Maybe a TV series??? It's a little like Make Room for Mommy (not Daddy), and LUCY entwined in one for the 21st century..... downright hilarious.

Author Wolf is a contributing editor at WIRED magazine and he tells this story with an insider's viewpoint. No doubt WIRED changed modern journalism, but how much did it contribute to the bluff and fluff of the Dot Com era that soaked so many average investors? That's a tale that Wolf never quite measures up in.  More business data would have been helpful. But we get the flavor of the times. WIRED should have and actually DID see the diversification of the communications world and the convergence of telecom, film, records, books and more. They did issues on BIOTECH and covered new technologies but the flavor of the time was DOT COM and somehow they became entwined in the not com aspect of what went wrong in the 90's. Wolf's viewpoint is only part of the larger story of why they didn't go public and how they managed to sell out for a fortune to Conde Nast. It's a pleasant read but most of us on the seesaw knew the story well. What we need really is a skyhigh view of what it was all about and the good and the bad and the ugly that evolved from that Silicon Valley bubble that almost blew us all away.	2003-09-16

I know this is NOT a book for dieters but rather an 'expose' of the food industry in America and our bad eating habits encouraged by the advertising moguls. BUT, author Greg Critser (whose own weight problem motivated the book) is brilliant at sorting out facts and figures and anecdotes to illustrate why we are FAT in America. He covers a) where the calories came from b) the unresistable urge to &quot;supersize&quot; everything, c) who let the calories in d) why the calories stay on our bodies --and it's harder than ever before to lose weight e) what fat is and isn't f) how bad the extra calories are for you and most importantly<br />G) WHAT CAN BE DONE. He recommends several foods including High fructose corn syrup (in many, many commercial products) to stay away from and he gives guidance to parents about supersizing and eating plans for kids who are getting fatter than ever before. I found this a very easy-to-read book. It should be on the shelf of every doctor in America, every teacher, every parent and yes, everyone who's trying to diet (and isn't that most of us). What's so fascinating is how 'geo-political' our weight gain is -- Critser traces it back in American politics to various deals done by past administrations. Amazing. I'm glad I found the book and I'm happy that Critser made the time to research all the triva, facts, figures and legislation and deals that weave together corporate Americana with the US Government in the FAT LAND of America.	2003-07-26

Wow, this is a challenging book to read because it shows the vulnerabilities of the talkshow host/personality Rosie O'Donnell and hints at some of the deep impact that childhood wounds can have on adults at any age. Part memoir and part narrative about a relationship she creates with a caller, it is odd and quirky and at times irresistable. Is she naive? Is she lonely? Is she nutz? Rosie has brought much happiness and fun to viewer's lives, the show ended in controversy as did the magazine she headed but we know there's more to come from this vibrant comedienne who love to share. What makes the book so fascinating is the ability to peek behind the screen/curtain and see what Rosie's family life was like and how it has and continues to affect her every day. I have the feeling we still haven't seen the real Rosie-- the mature woman who has made peace with the past and is glad to share the present.	2003-07-26

Just got this book and gave it a quick read. Most of the info is jammed into a few chapters. The rest of the book is recipes and the meal plans for stages one to three. I was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on phase one. Although I did start the diet today! It looks to be quite similar to the Lindora weight loss plan or the Suzanne Sommers Somercize plan where you include vegetables in the low fat, heavy protein plan. The good news is that Dr. Agatston's credentials are very impressive. The info about when and how to eat various types of carbs and fats is a nice addition to any dieter's repetoire. Although he warns against staying on stage 1 for more than 14 days some of his endorsers (included in the book) say they did stay on stage one for months. Several of the recipes look like they are keepers such as the spinach cups and the ricotta desserts. Might be worth the price just for those and of course for motivation for the next round in the fight on fat.	2003-07-21

The creator of VRML (virtual reality mark-up language) Pesce's visions are creating a new immersive society and info-mediaries for today and tomorrow. Pesce helps you learn how to pretend again-- how to make believe and use those skills to build new bridges to the future whether you're involved in tech or whether you just want to understand the next generation of anything -- people, places and things. Pesce tackles tough topics and adds an amusing presentation to help you understand such concepts as distributed intelligence, engineered structures and yes, toys.<br />Pesce maintains it started with the FURBY -- you remember those little gremlin like creatures form Tiger Electronics a few holiday seasons ago don't you? He says they are the beginning of being able to embody human intelligence into the machine world (at least the beginning of what we can see on our store shelves). IA -- intelligence augmented is probably more likely than AI artificial intelligence but as our devices get smarter and our phones know where are kids and colleagues are, it's comforting to think that you can learn to USE technology not have it replace YOU!. Pesce is optimistic that the new 'synthetic worlds will create a gateway to a living planet'. It's all just a few years ahead-- this book will serve as a bridge of knowledge to tomorrow and make you think about ordinary objects in extraordinary ways.	2003-07-20

Alone in a crowd of people it was the perfect book. I spent hours reading this book and finished it on the plane home (it was a long layover in Vegas). I was in the midst of finishing my 400 page book CUTTING THE CORD: GUIDE TO GOING WIRELESS and I thought I was losing touch with my heard by living too much in my head so it seemed like the perfect antidote. This is one of the dozen or so books I keep in my bedroom and reread -- verus books that are in my office. Even if you don't believe in love anymore, you'll find out more about yourself by reading this tome. Spiritual? Yes, but practical too -- by appealing to your analytical side, Ruiz somehow touches your soul. A great section on healing the emotional body is a lifelong guide to dealing with hurts and owning your own power. You don't have to read THE FOUR AGREEMENTS (also by this author) to value from this book but you might want to since it is a very wise book also. We don't have to learn about love the author maintains-- everything we know about love is in our GENES -- somehow that is quite comforting because the current literature and pop psychologists always say that we must learn, re-learn or modify ourselves, jump through hoops or twiste ourselves into pretzels to find the love we want.	2003-07-20

This is one of the few that has the honor of being read and re-read. It is one that I recommend to my career counseling clients and to anyone going through a transition (aren't we all)in life and/or love. Simple, easy to read, touching and memorable. An easy one to re-read at 3 am on one of THOSE mornings!!!	2003-07-20

I saw a small article in the New York Times about the workshop, jumped into a cap and was at the seminar 1/2 hour later. It was modestly priced and the book came as part of the deal. This is an extraordinary journaling method that seems to be a cross between keeping a diary, scrapbooking and artistry. We started our 'journals' in the class and I still add to mine. What makes this so different is that the author encourages you to use your creativity not just cut and paste or write. Without seeing this book you can't possibly realize how creative you can be. Bored with life, think you're in a rut on your job, just fired? On Vacation -- this is the book you need to buy immediately. Also see if you can buy a blank journal (don't know if Amazon.com sells them) but I'm sure you can find one at your local bookstore or stationery store. Or make one using your typewriter paper by putting it into a three ring binder. Don't worry you can decorate the binder so it will be a piece of art to cherish. You can share your journal with others or just keep it sacred and hide it in your underwear drawer or under a plant because by using it you will grow creatively. Yes, the author is an artist but what's so fascinating is once you 'get' how she does her journaling, you'll realize you can be an 'artist' too. No classes required.<br />This is journaling for the multimedia person. Add an audiotape or use these techniques on a personal web-page or blog and you breakthrough the clutter of print. Ever thought that your life was too boring for a journal? Ever get overwhelmed in presenting your thoughts or is it just too difficult a time to find the right words to write? Then this technique can help you breakthrough to express what's inside and to create a glorious journal of memorabilia for the future.	2003-07-20

Do you shine at Toastmasters or when you do a corporate presentation. Do you have a life-story to share or a cause that you believe in enough to want to influence other people with your thoughts? Then you may be a candidate for being a public speaker. Dottie is the BEST. I took her workshop several years ago and within days got my first $$$ speaking engagement. Why speak for free when you can get money for sharing your stories? Don't need the $$$ -- then give it to a charity or start a nonprofit foundation. What's so great is that Dottie and Lillet (her daughter) are in the trenches day after day helping and guiding some of the top speakers in the world create a business, not just a speech. She shows you contracts, forms, and reference material necessary to being an 'infopreneur' in the 21st Century. Attend one of her regional workshops if you wish.  ......	2003-07-20

The author really understands the art and science of forgiveness. Of course there are no guarantees but you will certainly begin to understand why you are stuck in the limbo of 'unforgiveness'. Easy to learn system that seems to work for many people. Too bad this book is out of print. It's a great book for our time.	2003-07-20

This is a fabulous book. A true story-- Tami Oldham Ashcraft tells it with her fellow author Susea McGearhart with a cinematic sense of excitement. BETTER THAN A PERFECT STORM. What makes this so realistic (of course it's true) is the vulnerability that is revealed. She overcomes obstacle after obstacle inside and outside. Perfect summer reading. Great reading if you're having a tough time in your life-- very inspirational. Plus terrific if you've just ended a romance or are in the midst of a break-up. Her power of letting go and moving on is truly admirable. The dialogue sounds real, the pictures they paint with words are powerful. REQUIRED reading for any sailor or anyone who is an armchair traveler. You won't be able to put it down !!	2003-07-19

Written with a trademark wit, the book draws on logs, journals and letters to give a fascinating account of man's quest for the North Pole. Just as Mars is now-- the North Pole was a mystery for the 19th Century explorer. This book picks up where the Barrow's Boys leaves off. It introduces you to some ice-clumped lunatics and some heros and heroines of the Northern arena. Great reading for the beach in the summertime. A bit academic but that's what is so fascinating because it appears to all be true. Sleighs, balloons, dogs, ships, zepppelins -- the last frontier was open for all to conquer. Some did, most didn't but the quest is what makes it so fascinating. What they ate, how they traveled, how they lived, how they raised the money-- they were the Olympians and astronauts of an age long gone by.	2003-06-29

At 175 pages or less it is an easy read in a weekend or even a long rainy day. Fun and enjoyable, it takes us back to the Bridges of Madison County and a trip through California and other states. But most of all it takes us forward as an epilogue to the famous book that became a wonderful movie. Robert Kincaid goes back in search of his Francesca Johnson with his truck named Harry. The characters he meets make the story seem real and warm. The language ranges from downright romantic to possibly pedantic in some areas. Pass quickly through the passages that don't please you to find some that will sing with your beliefs. Summer is always a good time to look back and to begin again in some way no matter what our ages. On the road-- he discovers more about life, himself and of course love. And the author gives us another 'bridge' to a future we could not even imagine Kincaid the solo photographer having. It may inspire you to take a second look at your surroundings as you vacation into your future.	2003-06-29

This book is fascinating since it is filled with plots and subplots and characters that are flawed, memorable and engaging. The current controversy about death row and the death penalty makes this book even more timely. The lead characters Larry, Muriel, Arthur and Gillian intertwine in a plot that leaves you guessing until the end. Perfect summer reading. Can't wait for the movie. What's so fascinating is Turrow's grasp at life and death and the present (where it all spirals together). Are you sure about your future, are you set in the past, do you yearn to create a new today. This is the kind of book that although it's a novel is excellent at spawning some soul searching about life and death and what you do for a living. Easy reading even if it's 400 pages-- you can finish it in a weekend or savor it for weeks. He tackles one of the major social issues of our time with vigor.	2003-06-29

The authors, a consultant and academic (and also it appears father and daughter) refer to this phenomenon as \\"Madison Avenue meets Main Street out for a walk. Mobile commerce is their focus along with how to incorporate that opportunity into your corporate customer relationship management (CRM) campaign. The biggest challenge of this book and many of the new wireless books is that if you don't know the lingo you might be left out. No glossary is included although there is an extensive 'endnotes' section to see where they got the info from.<br />In 31 chapters they cover lots of ground from the future of marketing to advertising-on-the-go to retailer advice. They tell us that more than 1 billion web-enabled phones and PDAs (personal digital assistants will be in the use worldwide (300 million in the US, compared to about 120 million today). They cover examples in b2b(business to business) and in direct-to-consumer marketing. So many chapters, so many topics, if there is any criticism it is that they set out to cover it all. How does wireless fit into the new multi-channel approach to marketing, sales and advertising? What's the new business eco-system that is evolving? Would have loved to have had more of an overview in the beginning. Alas, also no photos or screenshots of the ads and alerts leave us wondering what wireless will look like. Talking about 3G without seeing a phone or a screen is challenging. They do a nice job. Good book to give you an overview. Read with a yellow marker in hand so you can underline what's relevant to your background/mandate. Good reference book. One of the earliest wireless marketing books out there. Would have loved to see a full CRM plan for sample business arenas is retail, franchises, hospitality etc to see how wireless fits into a complete customer relations program. They do mention many applications but are not always specific about what technology, service and integration is used to complete the wireless apps. Would be fascinated to see a review by someone not deeply entrenched in the wireless world. Kudos to the authors for covering the ground they did..., service and integration is used to complete the wireless apps.
