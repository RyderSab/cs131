Not that the content is too technical in nature, but in order to appreciate what Erdos and his mathematician brethren do for a living and why they do it really requires someone who's &quot;been there and done that&quot;.  All in all I found it entertaining, and a wonderful insight into a brilliant individual. What the average person will no doubt appreciate is his tenacity, innate curiosity and unbelievable work habits. He is the classic oracle of mathematical knowledge and problem-solving.	2000-10-23
US	52868273	R26QZDFAOJ7Y4K	0451173139	464602444	Night Over Water	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A great adventure	Follett has a wonderful story-telling style, and a tremendous ability to create a picture in the mind.  Anyone would find this story riveting, and  fans of historical novels (particularly WWII genre) will particularly enjoy  this book.  My only criticism is, while I am not a prude, the book has more  than its share of gratuitous sex scenes. That having been said, I have not  been disappointed in a Follett novel yet. This book gives one a new  appreciation for the early pioneers of trans-atlantic travel.	2000-08-30

He shows how this  pattern of squelching of free speech has taken place over time by various  interest groups, and the absurd directions our society's mores and  standards of acceptable behavior have taken.  While many on the extreme  left of the political spectrum will denounce Stein, most people who still  have the ability to think critically will find the book refreshing, and  will probably find that their own deep-down personal feelings are well  represented here.  Who knows, you may realize that you too are part of the  VRWC.	2000-08-30

Just don't spend too  much time thinking about the plausibility of some of the character's  behavior and some of the action sequences. Baldacci is one of my favorite  authors, however I would rank this well behind some of his other work. I'm  getting a little weary of the single-mom-turned-selfless-heroine characters  that I have come across in about 6 of the last 10 books I have read.	2000-08-14

I could not put it down, and place this in my top ten  fiction books. Baldacci is now one of my favorite authors.  His character  development is superb, and his ability to weave a clever story is unique.   This is a must-read.	2000-08-14

The book covers everything  from the basics of the different types of telescopes and how to buy one, to  simply enjoying the stars using your two eyes or a pair of binoculars.   Dickinson also covers more advanced topics, but everything you need to know  to get going is here.  If you are shopping for a telescope for yourself, a  friend or loved one, buy this book first, or at least buy this along with  the scope. You'll be glad you did.	2000-08-07

I'm not one who needs  to have a &quot;happy ending&quot; all the time, I was just hoping for more  closure than I got.	2000-08-02

I kept waiting for a  twist or unexpected outcome, but didn't get it.  This does not, however,  take away from the quality of the book.  It's a page-turner cover to cover.	2000-08-02

I bought the book after a visit to  the Trellis restaurant in Williamsburg. Desaulnier's desserts are to die  for. If you are looking for simpler recipes, try the Hershey's chocolate  cookbook.	2000-07-06

Most of the book is good reading, leaving you anxious to see what comes next, but as was the case with the Laws of Our Fathers, I found the ending to be rather  dissapointing.  I will concede, however,that I listened to the abridged  version and will allow for the possibility that I missed something in the  abridgement. Overall, Turow writes a good story.	2000-06-30

While it may not be a &quot;life  changing&quot; book for everybody, it will hit home at some level for  almost all of us, because in some way we are all change-averse.  I would  actually recommend this to people whose jobs are being dramatically  affected by technology, or to the manager of these people.	2000-06-27

Goldratt has created the definitive book for managers of either manufacturing companies or service companies on getting focused on what really matters: the bottom line.  His use of a novel format  is extremely effective, and make the book a real page-turner.  This was  required reading in my wife's MBA program and I can now see why. So much of  what we read from the business-book genre authors gets us away from the  real goal - making money. Goldratt gets us there, but in a way that is  deeply personal.  Each of us can relate to the main character and the  pressure he faces at work as well as at home. Don't waste your time on  another business book until you read this one.	2000-06-27

I now have to read Walter the Baker nearly every night, and he talks about the book frequently while we're on trips.

From the day we first read this to our 2-1/2 year-old, he could not get enough of it.  It's an easy read, he loves the characters and the story line, and he talks about it incessantly.  I think the beauty of the book is  that kids can identify with it because it is based on actual experiences -  the excitement of an oncoming train, biking with mom or dad, anticipating  arrival of something exciting, and dreaming about it in bed later.  This is  a must for any kids book collection.	2000-06-19

Finder's style reminds me a lot of Ken Follett, and for anyone who has read Eye of the Needle by Follett, you will love this book.  Finder tells the story well,  perhaps gooes into a little too much detail here and there, but on the  whole the book was a quick and exciting read.  Finder is on my list of  authors to follow.	2000-06-15

The music is easy to read, uncomplicated and the book contains most of the popular childrens songs.  It also contains multiple  verses of the songs, which our kids love.

His descriptions of England in the late 1800s give you a marvelous image of life in that period, and he creates a fascinating discussion of the world  of finance at that time. The characters are memorable, and the societal  undercurrents of the time are well-treated.	2000-06-01

It is a wonderful diversion from the techno-spy-thriller that you so often read today.  While fiction, the plausibility of the story keeps the reader  engaged start to finish. The book features a wonderful matching of wits  between a cold-blooded Nazi spy and a professor-turned investigator.  The  sub-plots are riveting. This one's a page-turner!	2000-06-01

I found the political 'insider' view to be particularly  interesting, and will leave the reader wishing for a real-life presidential  candidate who is not a made-for-TV, non risk-taking empty suit.	2000-05-31

Despite being written in 1957, Rand is masterful in not dating her work. I strongly recommend this to all Americans, as it clearly defines the road  that awaits us if we allow socialist policies (championed by modern  liberals) to hold sway.  The book accelerates the process, and shows the  absurdity of the logical extension of liberalism. I think anyone who  considers themselves a liberal (or is a registered Democrat) should read  this book to truly understand the deeper roots of their beliefs. I would  strongly suggest this should be required reading for all students before  graduating high school, however its length makes that untenable.  This book  was recommended to me by an extremely liberal professor (also a lawyer) who  claimed she could not reconcile her beliefs with the persuasive arguments  put forth by Rand. It truly shows that capitalism and the profit motive  have been and continue to be the greatest forces for positive social change  in the world.	2000-05-25

The core idea is that respect and responsibility is cultivated very early in  life. Rosemond's book has been invaluable in helping us with common-sense  approaches to dealing with a two year-old.  And no, it does not involve  harsh punishments or spanking. For those who who have reached the end of  your rope as a result of being influenced by the psychobabble produced by  &quot;modern&quot; child psychologists, this book will be your savior.	2000-03-21
