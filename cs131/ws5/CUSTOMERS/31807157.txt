The writing is reader-friendly (at least for academic writing); the chapters are packed with interesting historical details that help to make the legal issues come alive; and the authors (almost all of whom are law professors) were selected from all points of the political spectrum.  Although there is enough legal analysis for readers to grasp the legal significance of each case, the writers generally avoid arcane doctrinal exegesis.       The reader should know, however, that the fifteen separate chapters do not add up to an overview of constitutional history or current constitutional law.  In fact, several chapters deal with cases that are usually cited today as paradigms of BAD constitutional law (Plessy v. Ferguson and Lochner v. New York).  The chapters are also of mixed quality.  Some are outstanding (such as the ones on McCullough v. Maryland or the Oregon peyote case).  Others, however, deal with ephemeral cases (such as Jones v. Clinton); at least one (on Roe v. Wade) is laughably one-sided; and one (on Dred Scott) seems more focused on attacking Robert Bork than on analyzing the details of the case (Bork is an easy target but he didn't need to figure so prominently in the discussion of a 19th century case).     With these caveats, I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in American constitutional law or history.	2005-10-01
US	31807157	R11F1ZSPPYJHB4	0375708618	474910652	The Supreme Court	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Part of the Story	This book is a survey of the history and internal functioning of the U.S. Supreme Court.  It's clearly written, tells some interesting history, and has a nice autobiographical section on Rehnquist's Supreme Court clerkship.  I liked it.  However, it's not a perfect introduction to the Court.        The main shortcoming is Rehnquist's failure to discuss the drafting or structure of the Constitution, or to analyze constitutional doctrine.  Instead, he focuses on politics and biography, not on legal technicalities.  This may be fine for non-lawyer readers, but even they should know that his historical coverage is spotty:  Dred Scott gets six pages, but Brown v. Board of Education only one; the Civil War civil liberties cases are discussed, but not the WWI cases; the Steel Seizure case gets two full chapters (!), more than any other in the book; the rise of railroads in the 19th century gets a longer treatment than the Great Depression; and Jefferson's assault on the judiciary gets only a few pages, whereas FDR's court-packing scheme gets an entire chapter.  It wasn't clear to me how Rehnquist picked topics to emphasize.    On the other hand, his book does have many virtues -- in particular, an absence of cant.  Rehnquist doesn't put the Supreme Court on a pedestal or pretend that legal reasoning yields indisputable results.  He acknowledges that decisions like Dred Scott or Lochner were politically-driven and had serious negative consequences for the country.  He also concedes that constitutional adjudication is not an exact science with certain methods for deciding cases.  This may seem obvious to anyone familiar with the Court's history, but it is uncommon wisdom for an age when conservatives act as if \\"Original Intent\\" were an apolitical algorithm for interpreting the Constitution.      My favorite sections of the book are those where judges are caught in the act of judging:  some stick to text and precedents, others consult legal philosophy or weigh policy consequences, while still others act from class and political bias.  Most judges probably blend all of these elements when adjudicating a constitutional case.  This messy reality explains why all Presidents -- from John Adams to George Bush -- have pushed to put their political soulmates on the Court:  it improves the odds of getting the \\"right\\" decisions.     It may also explain why Rehnquist chose to focus on the political nature of the Supreme Court.  Reading his obituaries (he died the day before I finished the book), I was struck by his youthful segregationism, his years of service as a Republican activist, and his connections to Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon.  Rehnquist knew what he was writing about.      As the candid historical reflections of a brilliant sitting Justice, his book is fascinating.  I enjoyed reading it very much.  However, laymen looking for a primer can do better.  I'd recommend Archibald Cox's \\"Court and the Constitution,\\" in spite of its age.	2005-09-05

Wainright, the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case which held that indigent criminal defendants are entitled to legal counsel at government expense.  Lewis tells the story from the viewpoints of the lawyers, the judges, and Gideon himself.  He mixes legal history with human interest stories; his writing is unfailingly clear; and he provides a wonderful primer on Supreme Court litigation.  The particular issues in Gideon are no longer of burning public interest, but the broad message that our criminal justice system must protect basic human rights is more relevant than ever in 2005.  Lawyers and laymen alike will enjoy the book.  Six stars.	2005-09-01

It met my expectations fully.  The writing is clear and graceful; phenomenology is related to broader cultural concerns (such as the rise of mathematized science); and the narrative tackles simple issues (such as perception and memory) before moving on to tough ones (such as temporality and language).  Throughout, the \\"natural attitude\\" (our experience of the world) is contrasted with the \\"phenomenological attitude\\" (our reflection on the natural attitude). The book has whet my appetite for sampling the phenomenology canon.    I gave the book only four stars because Sokolowski doesn't really engage with rival philosophical projects, especially analytic philosophy.  To be fair, he does draw distinctions between phenomenology and analytical approaches to human experience; in particular, he rejects any suggestion that internal mental entities mediate our experience of the world.  Unfortunately, he rarely grapples with analytic arguments in detail.      Maybe it's unfair to expect this in an introductory work.  However, given phenomenology's minority status in academia, most readers will have an analytic background.  Sokowlowski needed to show them, with explicit arguments, why phenomenology gives a superior account of our experience.  He rarely rose to this challenge.  But with that caveat, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in modern philosophy.	2005-08-26

He fell in love with the place and decided to put down roots, only to watch Robert Mugabe destroy Zimbabwe's economy and institutions in a bid to hang on to power.  Meldrum was expelled in 2003 because of his critical reporting.  To judge by his book, he got around the country, exposed human rights abuses, and showed courage in the face of harassment and a trumped up prosecution.  Granted, his writing verges on treacle at times, and he's too politically \\"engaged\\" to be completely credible as a journalist -- but then it's hard to be fair and balanced when writing about a dictator like Mugabe.  Meldrum has guts and his heart is in the right place.         That said, his book adds little to our knowledge of Zimbabwe.  As a good journalist, Meldrum sticks closely to his personal experiences.  Unfortunately, these consisted mostly of observing rallies and marches, interviewing opposition activists, consulting his maid about popular political attitudes, comparing notes with other journalists, and getting arrested.  We learn little about the inner workings of ZANU-PF or the reasons for the economic collapse.  Mugabe is no more than a stock villian.  The rural Shona are a  mystery.  The role of white business in funding anti-Mugabe activity is alluded to but not discussed.  We don't even learn about the contentious, often dysfunctional leadership of the opposition MDC party, or about MDC's rocky relationship with unions and civil society, even though Meldrum had friends and contacts in these camps.      Overall, there are too many anecdotes and too little analysis.  Readers who want an introduction to Zimbabwe's modern history would be better off reading Martin Meredith's superb \\"Our Votes, Our Guns.\\"  But readers who want a lively personal story will enjoy \\"Where We Have Hope.\\"	2005-08-15

As befits a book by two Economist writers, \\"The Company\\" reads like an Economist special supplement:  the analysis spans the globe; factoids are mixed with sweeping generalizations; interpretations masquerade as straightforward statements of fact; and dry subjects are enlivened with humor, literary touches, and insights from deep thinkers (like Coase and Chandler).  \\"The Company\\" is a very good read.     Unfortunately, it doesn't treat any subject in depth.  The endnotes show that the authors worked exclusively from secondary sources.  It's hard to know whether the authors are as sure of their material as their cocky tone suggests:  the section on well-known recent developments (mergers, corporate \\"unbundling,\\" Silicon Valley, globalization, etc., etc.) is filled with debatable judgments, confidently asserted.  This inevitably raises doubts about the book's treatment of distant, unfamiliar historical episodes.        One thing \\"The Company\\" does prove is that a limited-liability joint-stock company (i.e., a corporation) is a handy vehicle for amassing capital from multiple dispersed investors.  Something like it would have to exist in any capital-intensive, non-socialist economy.  But \\"The Company\\" also shows that the particulars of corporate form are conditioned by history, law, and culture; corporations vary radically from country to country and era to era.  The Microsoft of 1995 had little in common with the I.G. Farben of 1925 but for the fact that both were limited-liability joint-stock companies.            In this regard, the authors draw a helpful distinction between Anglo-American \\"shareholder\\" corporations (operated for the benefit of owners) and German-style \\"stakeholder\\" corporations (which include workers and community representatives on their governing boards).  The corporate model chosen by a nation has big implications for labor relations, investment decisions, and politics.  This is a radical message for Americans who see corporations as the creations of \\"the marketplace\\" and beyond the control of the community. If \\"The Company\\" awakens American readers to the variety of corporate models to choose from, it will have served an admirably subversive purpose.  Plus it's short!     Note:  A new book called \\"Icarus in the Boardroom\\" covers some of the same ground as \\"The Company.\\"  It too is short and breezy, but it is much more sophisticated and it really unpacks the legal and economic forces that drive corporate evolution.  I would recommend it over this book.	2005-08-11

Every part is interesting  but the high points include: (a) the discussion of why the fact/value dichotomy makes it impossible to derive ethical rules from the results of sociobiology; (b) the description of how the give-and-take of ethical argumentation leads to the adoption of an impartial point of view and, eventually, to a utilitarian ethics that encompasses all of humanity (the \\"expanding circle\\" of altruism to which the title refers); and (c) the analysis of why an impartial utilitarian ethic, to be effective, must be embodied in specific, inevitably-partial social rules that harness the realities of biological human nature.  It's not too glib to say that Singer begins with Edward Wilson and ends with Edmund Burke.      Readers should not pick up this book expecting to find an even-handed introduction to ethics.  The argument develops Singer's own views, giving scant attention to alternative positions; one huge omission is the failure to discuss John Rawls' non-utilitarian version of the impartial point of view.   That said, Singer's writing is clear and non-technical, the steps in his argument are carefully laid out, his judgments are sensible, and the issues he discusses are of perennial interest (even though sociobiology's heyday has come and gone).  Popular philosophy rarely gets better than this.	2005-08-07

Austrians are extreme libertarians who have many suggestive things to say about market processes, entrepreneurship, monetary theory, and the business cycle.  Unfortunately, they rarely test their speculations by doing empirical research, because they view economics as an \\"axiomatic\\" discipline based on the metaphysics of human action.  Some Austrians act as if Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard had the last word on economics in the 1960s.     Since they don't test their theories, Austrian economists tend to shun scholarly journals and rarely engage with mainstream economists.  Instead, they argue for Austrianism by citing first principles and heaping abuse on non-Austrians (Mises was especially vitriolic).  Many Austrian economists occupy themselves by writing popular and not-so-popular restatements of economic principles.  Others proselytize and pen polemical essays for the internet.  Still others analyze the feasibility of anarchism or defend monarchical theories of government.  The whole school inhabited something of an intellectual ghetto until it was rescued by the rise of Reagan and Thatcher after 1980.     Readers interested in an overview of Austrian economics but too busy to slog through 800-page tomes by Mises or Rothbard should turn to this compact, clearly-written book by A.H. Shand.  It reviews the main areas of contention between Austrians and neo-classical economics, and situates Austrian thinking within the history of economics.  Shand is broadly sympathetic to Austrian approaches, especially those of F.A. Hayek -- a rare Austrian who combined economic talent, good manners, a knowledge of history, and philosophical sophistication.  However, Shand isn't blind to the Austrian school's omissions, exaggerations, and occasional manias (such as Mises' obscurantist opposition to mathematics).  His analysis is balanced and non-dogmatic.      His book is over 20 years old but this doesn't matter because Austrians have had little new to say since Hayek died.  Maybe this isn't surprising for a school that believes that everything worth knowing about economics has already been discovered.	2005-08-01

Suffice it to say that the story is about a team of scientists trying to decipher the purposes and mentality of a sentient ocean on a distant planet.  They fail because human beings cannot, in the final analysis, exchange intelligible meanings with a truly alien intelligence -- and perhaps not even between themselves.  As Lem does in many books, much of \\"Solaris\\" is given over to the history of a made up field of science (in this case, Solaristics).  But unlike many of his books, the characters feel and speak like genuine people (even the \\"artificial\\" characters), and do not simply function as mouthpieces for philosophical ideas.  I liked \\"Solaris\\" very much, and was touched  by the tragic relationship between Kelvin and Rheya (she's an \\"artificial\\" person woven by the ocean out of Kelvin's dreams).  \\"Solaris\\" isn't for sci fi fans looking for heroics, punk posturing, or fantasy.  However, readers with a taste for philosophy or \\"serious\\" fiction will enjoy it.	2005-07-30

Even though my review was negative, I recently reread Goldstone's book after hearing him speak at a conference in Washington. His intelligence and decency must have made an impression on me, because I enjoyed \\"For Humanity\\" a lot more the second time.     I stand by my original assertion that the book is slight and unworthy of a jurist of Goldstone's stature; his failure, for example, to analyze the cases he prosecuted in Bosnia is inexplicable, given the sub-title of the book.  In the end, however, I'm giving the book two extra stars just because it was written by Goldstone.  He is a courageous, decent man who did the right thing at a time when many white South Africans evaded politics and took refuge in lives of privilege.  In addition, his anecdotes are pretty good, especially those at the expense of UN bureaucrats.        So...people should read his book, but they shouldn't have any illusions about what they'll find.  Goldstone provides little historical context about the end of apartheid or the disintegration of Yugoslavia.  Anyone looking for that history should look elsewhere.  However, those who already know the basic story (I used to live in South Africa) may enjoy his book.  It's a good read and can be polished off in three or four hours.  Now, if Goldstone would just write a serious autobiography about his amazing career in law, human rights advocacy, and diplomacy, he'd get five star reviews!	2005-07-24

Strangely, more space is given to \\"communitarian\\" critics such as Michael Sandel than to libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who is usually treated as Rawls' intellectual nemesis.  The authors write clearly and their discussion is fine as far as it goes; however, it doesn't go very far.  The book is too short and sketchy to be of much value to anyone except absolute beginners in philosophy.	2005-07-21

The authors' basic idea is that reducing India's high labor/land ratio is the only way to raise living standards for hundreds of millions of Indians who live below the poverty line.  Along the way, the authors give incredibly clear explanations of basic economic concepts like marginal product, general equilibrium, and comparative advantage.  They also use their models to provide a fascinating explanation of why free trade with Britain probably increased poverty in India in the 18th and 19th centuries.  I gave the book four stars instead of five only because the discussion of contemporary policy issues is dated and overly-anecdotal.  Otherwise, this book is a small gem of exposition and analysis.  If only all economists wrote this well.	2005-07-17

Readers wanting more realism should read \\"Understanding Capitalism,\\" a superb introduction to economics written from a social democratic perspective.  As in any introductory econ text, the book carefully analyzes market processes.  However, it also analyzes \\"command\\" relationships within firms, and the relationship between capitalist dynamics and economic growth.  This \\"three dimensional\\" approach to economics -- the authors prefer the term \\"political economy\\" -- offers a comprehensive view of the subject.          The core chapters deal with microeconomics and macroeconomics.  The micro section draws on Marx and Schumpeter, and focuses on profit-seeking and \\"accumulation\\" as the keys to understanding capitalist dynamics.  The macro chapters draw on and update Keynes, and explain why unemployment is a persistent feature of U.S.-style capitalism (Swedish-style capitalism is a different matter).  Throughout, economic concepts are related to ideas from anthropology, history, political science, and environmental science.  Key points are illustrated with examples from the daily news; there is algebra, but no calculus; the writing is clear.  This is a very reader-friendly econ text.      It is also refreshingly non-dogmatic.  Although the authors are leftists, they acknowledge that capitalism obliterates archaic economic structures and lifts standards of living.  They also highlight the role of profit-seeking in the development of new technologies and production methods.  Their tone is consistently reasonable and fair to all points of view.  Of course, no book is perfect.  I would have preferred a more traditional analysis of microeconomics (complete with graphs showing average cost, marginal cost, and so forth).  The sections on international trade and finance are too skimpy for a book trying to make sense of modern globalized capitalism.  But overall, \\"Understanding Capitalism\\" is superb.  No one taking a mainstream lower-division course on economics should miss it -- and anyone teaching such a course should consider using it as a supplemental text.	2005-07-05

Wells had a knack for turning the Victorian worldview upside down.  In \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" Martian invaders assault imperial Britain and slaughter the inhabitants like bushmen in the Kalahari desert.  In \\"The Time Machine,\\" Wells sketched a world where capitalist social relations have led to grotesque evolutionary changes.  Both books are throught-provoking and superbly written.  They belong to the science fiction canon.<br /><br />\\"The Time Machine\\" tells the story of a Londoner of 1895 who travels 800,000 years into the future, to an age when mankind has split into two separate species.  One group, the spawn of capitalist ease and affluence, has been reduced to the mental and physical level of children; the other group has become feral after eons of industrial toil.  Neither group is human any longer; culture and intelligence have died out forever.  In fact, with the social tables turned, the \\"lower\\" orders now use their \\"betters\\" as a food source!<br /><br />Wells' vision of human decline was subversive and eloquent, and offered a wry counterpoint to the Victorian cult of progress.  The penultimate chapter -- in which the time traveler voyages 30 million years into the future, to an era when the sun is dying, humanity is long-extinct, and lichens have inherited the earth -- is heartbreaking.

H.G. Wells produced a suspenseful, unsentimental, grippingly \\"realistic\\" account of a Martian assault on England circa 1900, when the British Empire was at the height of its power.  With the tables turned by superior Martian technology, the invaders drive England to the point of civilizational collapse, as thousands of Englishmen are incinerated, gassed, and exterminated like 19th century Africans or Asians resisting well-armed European imperialists.  In the end, England is saved -- but not by cleverness, pluck, or heroics.  It is saved by microbes, which infect and wipe out the Martians, who lack any immunities.  The technology in the novel may seem old-fashioned, but Wells's tone and sensibility -- his ability to convey a sense of the smallness of mankind and the fragility of social structures -- is astonishingly modern.  The book towers over most science fiction.	2005-06-19

Sawyer, a landmark Supreme Court case on Presidential powers.  The case arose when the White House nationalized steel factories in order to block a labor strike that threatened to disrupt steel production during the Korean War.  The Supreme Court firmly rejected Truman's claim of an \\"inherent\\" Presidential power to seize private property during wartime.  Given the extremist constitutional claims made by the current Bush Administration -- including the power to hold American citizens incommunicado for the duration of the (potentially endless) war on terror -- Youngstown remains hugely relevant today.    Marcus lays out the political, legal, and foreign policy contexts of Youngstown before delving into the details of the litigation and discussing the constitutional significance of the outcome.  Her  exposition is workmanlike and methodical, as befits a recycled doctoral dissertation.  My only real complaint -- hence the rating of four stars -- is that long sections of the book are little more than summaries of legal briefs and courtroom oral arguments.  These could have been cut back.  But with that qualification, I would recommend the book without reservation to anyone interested in American constitutional history or the institution of the Presidency.	2005-06-18

However, I can't agree with the Amazon reviewers who say that \\"The City and the Stars\\" is a \\"masterpiece\\" or describe it as Clarke's \\"best\\" novel.  The book has some cool ideas -- manmade reincarnation, for example -- but the writing stumbles whenever Clarke strives for \\"cosmic grandeur.\\" Some of the writing, in fact, is painfully amateurish, as when all the characters speak in the same wooden voice, or when the history of the galaxy is laid out in a super-contrived sequence at the end of the novel.<br /><br />The book's main structural problem is the protagonist, a 20-year old man who defies the conventions of his society and ends up changing human history.  He's present in almost every scene and drives the whole plot, but he never rises above the level of a cliche.  This leaves a big hole at the center of the book.<br /><br />Clarke was a young man when he wrote \\"The City and the Stars,\\" and he may not have understood that he had no talent for writing about people.  Once he made the literary choice to put ideas and science, rather than characters, at the center of his novels, he produced genuine classics like \\"2001\\" or \\"Rendezvous With Rama.\\"  That said, \\"The City and the Stars\\" is worth reading.  It was the first sci fi novel ever read by my 12-year old son -- and he loved it.  For that reason alone, it deserves three stars.	2005-06-03

Together they practically created the field of law and economics.  Unfortunately, the central ideas (for which Coase won the Nobel prize) have been so thoroughly integrated into economics curricula that they no longer seem fresh or novel; in fact, they are now almost humdrum economic \\"common sense.\\"      That's a tribute to Coase and his impact on economic thinking, but it does make it hard for the reader to get excited about this book.  Nevertheless, Coase's writing still has great value as a model of clear exposition, and it reminds us that simple, non-mathematical thought experiments can profoundly shape our view of economics.  Any well-stocked economics library must include \\"The Firm, the Market, and the Law.\\"  Highly recommended.	2005-05-30
US	31807157	RK2OUCJ0SR015	0674298004	78796814	The Federalist	Books	5	18	23	N	N	At Least Five Stars	The Federalist was an astonishing political document.  Written for public consumption during the debate over adoption of the U.S. Constitution, it combined immense learning and sophistication with shrewd insights into the nature of politics in a republic.  It's an essential text for anyone interested in American political history or constitutional theory.  In fact, the Federalist should be essential readingt for any educated American:  it remains an unparalleled example of realistic political analysis being placed in the service of political ideals.<br /><br />After more than 200 years, the Federalist has lost little of its relevance. The sections on judicial review and Presidential nominations, for example, could have been written about current controversies over judges. Likewise, the discussion of Presidential war powers, or the emphasis on checks and balances as essential to the preservation of liberty, are eerily topical in an age of pre-emptive war and one-party control of Washington.  Even when the analysis is wildly dated -- as with the Commerce Clause or slavery -- the reader can see how far Constitutional doctrine has wandered from the \\"intent\\" of the Founders.<br /><br />The Federalist is also superb as literature:  the writing is droll and eloquent, once you get used to the long, convoluted sentences.  The introduction by Benjamin Wright is excellent and helps to place the text in political and intellectual context. I don't know why I wasn't forced to read the Federalist at law school!  Six stars.<br /><br />Note:  Contrary to one review below, God is hardly mentioned in the Federalist, and then only as a rhetorical flourish.  The Federalist has countless references to ancient Greece and Rome, but none to the Old or New Testaments.  It is a thoroughly secular document.

He argued that the Founding Fathers had foisted the Constitution on the country in order to protect their property interests in land and public securities.  This was strong medicine 90 years ago when the public still thought of the Founders as demigods rather than conspiratorial politicians.<br /><br />Despite its age, the book reads well and is refreshingly iconoclastic.  Since rightwing politicians and jurists still talk as if the Constitution had a divine origin, Beard's message hasn't lost its relevance.  However, there's no denying that his book is a one-sided lawyer's brief, which selects and presents only the evidence that supports its thesis while ignoring everything else.  No one who has read The Federalist would even recognize Beard's description of it.<br /><br />Modern readers who want a balanced and comprehensive history of the origins of the Constitution should look to books by Forrest MacDonald or other historians.	2005-04-13

In slightly more than 200 pages, David Skeel tells the story of CEOs who took huge gambles with corporate assets in order to boost profits and share prices.  Although the media and public idolize larger-than-life CEOs, Skeel shows how throwing the dice can often result in ruin for corporations and their employees and shareholders.  His book ranges from 19th century railroad bankruptcies to the rise and fall of Enron, tying together economic history, financial theory, business law, and the politics of regulation.  It's sophisticated but breezily written.  I'd give it six stars if I could.	2005-04-03

Although clearly written, the essays are only loosely linked, and it's hard to imagine what their audience was intended to be.  Lawyers will be put off by the lack of a comprehensive legal overview of the new International Criminal Court; historians and political scientists will be disappointed by the short shrift given to the Yugoslavia and Rwanda war crimes tribunals; and the general reader probably won't have enough background to appreciate the occasional esoteric legal point.  Frankly, almost any reader -- professional or layman -- would be better off with William Schabas' An Introduction to the International Criminal Court, which gives a lucid overview of the law and fills in the historical details.	2005-03-26

Although Sweezy wrote in the 1940s, his book holds up well, and brings out the basic points of difference between Marxist and neo-classical economics.  Sweezy was always ready to go beyond the strict Marxist canon, as, for example, in his clear and still relevant analysis of monopoly.  The prospective reader should know, however, that the book reflects the concerns of mid-20th century Marxists:  it's heavy on intra-Marxist debates about underconsumption theory, chronic stagnation, and fascism, but there's nothing on modern topics such as gender or the environment.  The reader should also know that the argument of the book is largely theoretical and abstract:  the paucity of empirical or historical data is astounding, as if Sweezy saw economics as an a priori science -- which would be a very non-Marxist perspective!	2005-03-16

In spite of his prominence in the Johannesburg bar, Fischer rejected the racist system that oppressed the majority black population.  He joined the Communist Party, worked underground, and defended Nelson Mandela and other activists.  Eventually, he was arrested and jailed during a crackdown on the Party.  Unlike Mandela, who lived to see the collapse of apartheid, Fischer never entered the promised land:  he died of cancer in 1975, at the high point of Afrikaner power.  Nevertheless, his inclusive, tolerant approach to politics and his saintly personal example influenced a generation of ANC and Communist activists, helping to shape South Africa's current multiracial and democratic constitutional order.  This lovely book is a moving testament to a lovely life.  Although Clingman is a bit longwinded and uncritical, anyone interested in South African history will learn from and enjoy his tome.  Law students and young lawyers should also read it.  Six stars!	2005-03-03

The jumping off point is a detailed analysis of the temptations Jesus faced in the wilderness:  to live for material things, to seek personal security, and to clamor for social position.  Once we overcome these temptations, the path is cleared for a spiritual pilgrimage; if we are lucky, the pilgrimage culminates in trust in Christ and faith in the Resurrection.  \\"Temptation\\" doesn't present a comprehensive apologetic for Christianity.  Instead, it profoundly reorients the reader and offers a view of the human world in which Christianity can make sense.  It is really, really good.	2005-02-02

Books	4	11	14	N	N	Brilliant Mess	This brilliant book seeks to explain why the industrial revolution occurred in Europe rather than Asia.  As Pomeranz shows, no objective observer in 1750 could have predicted that a breakthrough would happen in Europe:  Europe and China had comparable economic conditions and institutions, and both faced similar population pressures on the land.  Pomeranz argues that Europe escaped its ecological constraints because of access to nearby coal deposits and to land-intensive products from the New World.  In contrast, China had to resort to labor-intensive land management techniques.  Europe took off while China entered an economic cul de sac.     For skeptics of neo-classical economics, \\"The Great Divergence\\" is a bracing example of how pat economic models can be undermined by historical evidence.  In particular, Pomeranz's data and arguments cast doubt on the standard neo-classical version of Europe's development, which highlights the role of \\"efficient\\" markets while ignoring extra-market contributions from slavery, armed trading, and colonies.      Unfortunately, the book is really badly written.  The text meanders from country to country, sector to sector, and era to era.  Even worse, it is dense with facts, counter-factuals, arguments, counter-arguments, sweeping sociological speculation, and statistical minutiae.  Almost every page has a paragraph (or two) of information that should have been briefly summarized or relegated to a footnote.  A brilliant book like this should have been more reader-friendly.  Shame on the editors at Princeton University Press.	2005-01-22

The book is based on declassified documents and interviews with friends and colleagues of Habib.  It is well-written and does a great job of conveying the atmospherics and intrigue of a sensitive, high-level diplomatic mission.  As pure diplomatic history, however, it leaves much to be desired, since it glosses over the negotiating details and often fails to put developments into a broader political context -- at times, the history gets buried beneath the war stories, great quotes, inside-Washington gossip, and focus on Habib's colorful personality.  But these are quibbles:  the book is a real page-turner.  Anyone interested in State Department history or the modern Middle East will love it.	2005-01-10

It's a travelogue, philosophical meditation, intellectual autobiography, father/son story, spiritual quest, and tale of madness -- all rolled into one.  Because of the book's ambition, it's easy to take cheap shots at it.  For example, it's impossible to deny that the author, Robert Pirsig, is a crank -- who else would believe that he's solved the deepest problems of Western civilization?  It's also true that some of Pirsig's details about Greek philosophy and the history of science are wrong -- Copernicus did not, for example, discover that the Earth is round.  However, these are quibbles.  The overall impression \\"ZAMM\\" leaves on the reader is that thinking is a serious, almost life-or-death adventure.  In a culture awash with materialism, fundamentalism, and nonsense disseminated on the internet, that's a huge accomplishment.  I can't think of any book that would do a better job of getting an intelligent high school or college student turned on to philosophy.  Six stars!	2005-01-02

The scientists have been assembled by the military in order to decode a neutrino transmission from an alien civilization.  The military hopes that the project will duplicate the scientific success of the Manhattan Project and lead to new advanced weapons.      The book has the virtues and vices associated with most of Lem's science fiction.  On the plus side,  Lem speculates about man and the cosmos on the basis of real ideas from epistemology, evolutionary biology, and systems theory.  He also dishes out mordant satire at the expense of bureaucrats, soldiers, and the arms race.  On the down side, Lem's writing is constipated, his characters are thin, and the narrative bogs down whenever he puts mini-essays into the mouth of his scientist narrator.     It's hard to avoid feeling that polymath Lem was more interested in ideas than stories.  It's also hard to know whether his ideas are genuinely mind-expanding or just amazingly clever.  He should have written philosophy rather than science fiction.	2004-12-27

The bad news is that the book stays narrowly focused on technical legal doctrines, only sketching the law's social and political context.  Bottomline:  this is a great book for someone, perhaps a law student or non-legal historian of Rome, who wants a quick guide to Roman legal rules.  But it's not such a great book for laymen who are interested in learning more about life in ancient Rome.	2004-12-21

Unfortunately, Baskin doesn't manage this huge volume of material by picking out key events and themes.  Instead, he repeatedly compresses complex institutional and financial developments into a few paragraphs of leaden prose, squeezing in as much material as possible.  Time and again I found myself reading and rereading a paragraph and wondering what it meant.  Corporate finance students might have better luck than I did, but I doubt that even they would enjoy the book.  In fairness to Baskin, the book is refreshingly skeptical about academic finance theories, and it does draw together material otherwise hidden in technical books and journals -- but those aren't good reasons for laymen read it.  They would get more out of better-written books by Charles Kindleberger or John Kenneth Galbraith.	2004-12-15

To my knowledge, it was the first book to spell out how modern corporate capitalism is characterized by pervasive oligopoly and the separation of management from ownership.  These points are still valid today, and remind us that modern capitalism has little in common with the social system analyzed by Adam Smith and other Classical economists.  However, most of \\"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\\" is taken up with an out-of-date, pre-SEC review of corporate finance law as it existed in 1930.  As a result, the book will be of little interest to most modern readers, even though it is a \\"must\\" purchase for any serious library of books on economics or corporate governance.	2004-12-06

The author, Professor Michael Jubien, is a neo-Platonist, for lack of a better term.  He writes clearly, lays out arguments carefully, and takes a stand on the issues -- he even notes when his arguments are speculative or in need of further exposition.  That said, I gave the book only four stars.  For one thing, it isn't an \\"introduction\\" to metaphysics.  Any reader who hasn't taken basic courses in philosophy or logic will find much of the discussion incomprehensible.  For another, Jubien makes almost no effort to situate his analysis within the history of philosophy, or to link it to  larger issues of science, ethics, or culture.  He seems to be a \\"philosopher's philosopher,\\" the kind who solves puzzles for the sake of puzzle-solving, without fussing over \\"the meaning\\" of it all.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing in a philosopher -- but readers should know what they're getting into.	2004-11-30

Fried writes economically, has argued constitutional cases before the Supreme Court, and offers fascinating insights into the nature of constitutional adjudication.  However, the reader should know that Fried's analysis is narrowly legal, and almost devoid of historical, biographical, or political context.  In fact, the discussion is so abstract that readers without a constitutional law background will have difficulty following the analysis at many points.  On the other hand, readers who stay abreast of these issues will enjoy the book.  (I'm a former lawyer.)	2004-11-19

I gave the book four stars instead of five because Evans is defensive to a fault and too respectful of post-modernist hype.  Post-modernism is surely one of the dopier intellectual fads of the late 20th century.  Good historians have always been careful to read documents critically; they have always known that interpretations of source material can be shaped by extra-historiographical considerations.  This element of \\"looseness\\" is an invitation to rational discussion of the historical record.  It is not proof that rational discussion is impossible or that historians are condemned to irreducible subjective bias.  Working historians should treat post-modernism the way working scientists do:  by ignoring it and going about their business.	2004-10-29

The author immersed himself in private letters, official hearings, and newspaper editorials from the era.  The result of this research is a compelling picture of a sleazy and violent episode in American history, when Republican politicians launched a war to boost their prospects in the 1898 midterm elections.  The book is timelier than ever after 9/11, since imperialism has come back into vogue in the guise of anti-terrorism -- anyone who has illusions about America's \\"innocence\\" today should read Miller's accounts of atrocities and racism circa 1900.      I gave the book four stars instead of five only because the narrative is based almost exclusively on U.S. sources.  In particular, Miller's endless rehashing of imperialist and anti-imperialist newspaper editorials gets quite old at times.	2004-10-19

It was unfinished at the time of Nouwen's death and retains a half-baked, rushed quality.  There is remarkably little description of Adam's everyday life:  indeed, for every sentence about Adam, there must be three or four about Nouwen's interior life.

The reader gets a good feel for the issues faced by policymakers in Washington and Madrid.  However, Offner's failure to put events in a broader social or political context makes for a dry narrative.

Conroy reconstructs three episodes:  the torture of IRA suspects by the British Army in 1971; the torture of Palestinians by Israeli troops in 1988; and the torture of a cop-killing suspect by Chicago police in 1982.  Along the way, he reflects on torture in countries such as Greece, Rhodesia, and Uruguay; he also explores the implications of scientific studies such as the famous Milgram experiment.  The narrative is constructed out of media accounts, official documents, and Conroy's own interviews.  The writing is calm and factual, even though the subject is horrifying.              Although this book was published in 2000, it will be a wake up call for anyone who naively thinks think that Abu Ghraib was the work of a \\"few bad apples\\" in the U.S. Army.  The \\"stress and duress\\" techniques used in Iraq -- sleep deprivation, hooding, sexual humiliation, muscle stress, etc. -- are standard operating procedures for interrogators who want to torture prisoners without leaving traces of physical abuse.  As Conroy documents, these techniques were used in Northern Ireland and on the West Bank; they were also taught to Latin American soldiers by the U.S. Army and the CIA.     The only thing unique about Iraq, alas, is the fact that U.S. soldiers were stupid enough to film their own atrocities.	2004-05-21

It has enough journalism to be an exciting read, and enough economics to inform readers about modern international finance. It's hard to put down -- which is something that can be said about very few books dealing with the IMF.    There are two schools of thought about the crises of the late 1990s.  One school -- the Markets-Don't-Err school --  blames poor economic management in the stricken countries.  In this view, investors lost confidence in emerging markets after government deficits put downward pressure on exchange rates and poor banking practices led to corporate overindebtedness.  The second school -- the Markets-as-Herd school -- blames the dynamics of international capital itself.  Investors, having recklessly plowed money into emerging markets in the early 1990s, got cold feet when Thailand's currency collapsed in 1997.  They then stampeded to liquidate their positions in other emerging-market currencies, punishing countries willy-nilly regardless of their underlying economic fundamentals.       It's a measure of the book's success that members of both schools can find evidence to support their position.  My only complaint -- not serious enough to give the book less than 5 stars -- is the patchy quality of the narrative.  Malaysia is barely mentioned at all, for example.  I suspect this is because sections of the book were recycled from Washington Post articles.	2004-05-13

It's been translated into dozens of languages, is taught at universities around the world, and has generated a huge library of academic and non-academic commentary.  Although the book's core conclusions are broadly social democratic, even right-wing scholars like Robert Nozick, Richard Epstein, and Friedrich Hayek have hailed its brilliance.    But now Mr. Walt Byars, a libertarian economist and philosopher in Tampa, Florida, has discovered that the book is \\"blatantly shoddy, contradictory, and confused.\\"  Mr. Byars' review can be found immediately below.  His criticism is focused on a short section (in a very long book) where Rawls discusses time preference.  Briefly put, Rawls contends that people in the \\"original position\\" won't choose principles of justice that discriminate between people living at different periods of time.    For reasons that aren't given, Mr. Byars claims that this move destroys the argument of \\"A Theory of Justice\\" since people in the real world -- ah ha! -- do have time preference.  This claim is curious:  as anyone who has actually read the book knows, Rawls imposes all sorts of \\"unreal\\" conditions on persons in the \\"original position\\" in order to remove the influence of bias and arbitrariness on the selection of principles of justice.      Mr. Byars is a good sport, checks his reviews, and is never shy about offering his opinions, so Amazon readers might want to check to see how he responds to my remarks.  In the meantime, they should ignore his negative comments and read \\"A Theory of Justice.\\"  The book is long and often boring, but it offers a wealth of sophisticated philosophical and political arguments that have engaged thinkers around the world.  People who read it carefully and think about the arguments -- rather than peruse it to find areas where it contradicts their pet theories -- will find their worldview transformed and deepened, even if they reject many of Rawls' conclusions.	2004-05-13
