Wibberley's historical novel makes Longinus a weary veteran captured by Britons in youth. Longinus escapes, brings the legions to kill the Britons, and Ruafocus, his British father-in-law, becomes his servant.  The delicate relationship between the men culminates in Longinus asking Jesus to heal Ruafocus.  It is a very moving, delicately structed novel, with a wonderful feeling for the dawn of Christianity in the Roman world.	2004-11-26

This one is outstanding, and moves from both his standard Manhattan and suburban settings to the borough of Queens.  Lyle and Charlie Kenton are very attactive additions to the series; I hope to see more of them!  <br />There are weaknesses.  Wilson isn't entirely comfortable with the Kenton brothers, and his ghastly version of Detroit black street language is a distracting nuisance.  Lyle, the very upwardly mobile, articulate, and sharply intelligent con artist, is more realistic.   Gia from Iowa remains as boring as her unbearably cutesy daughter, but the reader can skip past her.  <br />Otherwise it's a lively, exciting, well-developed novel, with flashes of acid humor.   The settings are very well-handled, and the pacing is breathless.  Grab a copy for the beach or subway!<br />Now when will Dr. Wilson set a story in the Bronx?  We have Edgar Allan Poe's cottage and Woodlawn Cemetery, so well written of in Peter Beagle's _A Fine and Private Place_, to tempt him!	2004-07-13

On the strength of that, I bought the hardcover!  The mildly offensive &quot;Author's Note&quot; sets the tone for a novel that seems to be awkwardly and unwisely resurrected from the author's back files.  In Stephen King's words, &quot;Sometimes dead is better.&quot;<br />Every imaginable cliche and stereotype appear.  A rabbi wavers between stage Yiddish and standard English.  A whiskey priest is, of course, Irish American, and infatuated with a religious sister.  His late 20s niece, cutely and improbably baptized Lacey, calls him &quot;Unk.&quot;  Adorable.  Lacey is a remarkably boring militant feminist lesbian atheist with lots of corny Celtic tattoos and bulging biceps.   Her &quot;anarchist&quot; hero is, of all people, Madelyn Murray O'Hair!  The religious Sister of Mercy (a la Leonard Cohen?) is Carole, and her best buddy is a stage Irish Sister Bernadette, with an accent to make Barry Fitzgerald vomit.  Even the vampires seem as wooden as if already impaled.<br />In _The Tomb_ and other &quot;Adversary&quot; novels, Wilson shows regrettable ignorant and juvenile religious prejudice.  Sheer story-telling ability makes the reader forgive this.  Not here!  He has 5 year old altar boys, and adolescent fantasies of an empty Pepsi can used for a chalice -- no one in New Jersey could find a drinking glass or coffee mug? Not even the woman who bakes bread and heats up stew?<br />At a guess, this was written in the early 1970s, rejected for everything from bad writing to tasteless bigotry, and finally published based on later success.   Wilson is now a fine writer, and this book is terribly unfair to his present skill.   Don't read this, but do buy the &quot;Repairman Jack&quot; and most of his other excellent novels!	2004-07-13

After supercilious years of looking down on his father as an innocent unacquainted with &quot;real&quot; life, Jack discovers a ruthless, extremely self-disciplined, and honorable man.  This Korean War veteran and Marine sniper is his father -- and unrealized role model. <br />The Everglades are wonderfully evoked here, with touches of Zora Neale Hurston's lush description.  The novel picks up the pathos of the &quot;clan&quot; of nexus-deformed persons trapped by their &quot;home.&quot;  Carl, the only one to escape to near-normal life, is touching and charming. <br />Anya is a great creation, and her dog Oyv is perfect.

Alas, Ms. Peterson and Mr. Bell decide to ruin a nice little costume murder mystery, on the lines of the Goldy Bear series, by injecting a great deal of illogical religious bigotry that actually interferes with the story.  The flashbacks to evil nuns and similar nonsense are sheer bad writing.<br />By the way, it is impossible to have a character whose real name is Kathleen Shannon.  She might as well be called Kathleen Mississippi!  Shannon is the name of a river, and related to a Celtic deity.  It has never been a family name, though it has sometimes been taken as an alias.  Nor can her father be Harry T. Shannon!  Henry and its diminuative Harry are not and never have been popular in Ireland, due to the actions of Henry VII of England against the Irish.	2004-04-06

Many writers are very unfamiliar with Catholicism in general, and at least one talks of a discredited apparition of Our Lady.  There are some good things in the Appendices.  Otherwise, it reads like &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; meets &quot;Highway to Heaven.&quot;  I recommend instead Maisie Ward's _The Splendor of the Rosary_, written at the end of WW II.

Agatha Christie wearied of Hercule Poirot.  _Somebody Else's Music_ suggested Haddam was ready to move on to different series characters; her other series ran only to a few good mysteries.<br />Haddam has a good plot, based on contemporary social and economic problems.  The story line is strong, and appropriately unnerving.  Unfortunately, the characters drift.  Father Tibor swears mildly, but too often.  Bennis is almost invisible, other characters are completely off stage.  Gregor and John Henry Newman Jackman can't carry the action alone, and the reader misses the rich mixture of well-developed characters.  The names could be changed easily, and the book presented as a non-series thriller.   <br />It's a good mystery, but not up to her outstanding standards.  On the other hand, I do look forward to her next venture.  She's a fine writer, and it should be exciting to meet her new characters.	2003-09-05

Far from &quot;passing for white,&quot; the Healy brothers suffered double persecution; by birth they were despised as both Irish and African, and by religion they were despised as Catholic in a virulantly anti-Catholic America.  They were illegitimate according to American laws, though they were legitimate in a Europe that accepted the interracial marriage of their parents.  Patrick Healy became a Jesuit not to &quot;pass for white,&quot; but out of love.  He became President of Georgetown University.

Even the demure Aimee, abducted and sold as a slave, doggedly created a life for herself within a Turkish seraglio.  Recent muddled books on these women often verge on either the pornographic or the bathetic; Blanch's account was light-hearted; her humor, sympathy, and realism tempered her admiration.  This was a best-seller in 1954, and is still immensely readable -- even if Blanch spoke more languages than some annoyed reviewers, and was not suitably PC for 2003.

His sado-masochistic novel features a little-known lapsed anchoress, Christine Carpenter of Shere.  Raped by the Lord of the Manor only in Dr. Moorcraft's lurid fiction, she walls herself up in conditions no medieval parish would accept.  He matches this with Michael Duval, a demented 1960s Catholic priest who kidnaps and tortures young women so that they may \\"become\\" his fantasy girlfriend, Christine.  Dr. Moorcroft misses no possible cliche, no imaginable foolish error, no modern superstition about the actual Middle Ages.  He hasn't got a good grip on the 1960s either.  The last of Duval's victims, Marda Stewart, is a remarkably stupid young woman, who survives mostly by accident and her genuine cooperation with her captor's fantasies.  In this book no one thinks; \\"instinct\\" and \\"intuition\\" rule.  I felt extremely sorry for the real Christine Carpenter, a confused but earnest young woman, who honestly tried a difficult vocation and failed.	2002-10-17

Like most of the stock characters in this mystery, he's unbelievable, inconsistent, and surprisingly uninteresting.  Supposedly he's embezzling church funds and ending an affair with a fiftyish ex-Sister.  An old man brags (yes, brags) to Higgins that his divorced daughter is committing adultery, and then is furious that Higgins denies Communion to the woman.  Since Higgins is so venal an unbeliever, it's unlikely he'd bother.  But the father and daughter are as unbelieving if they think adultery equals a state of grace! The best character is the hated housekeeper, who is consistently described as extremely old after 40 years' service -- she's about 55, having come from Ireland in 1958 as a schoolgirl planning to continue her education.  The heroine, Sister Mary Helen, is 78 but not regarded as old.  Such odd prejudices provide the only interest.	2002-09-23

Benson wrote two mystical visions of the future.  _The Dawn of All_ is an extremely romantic and improbable 1911 parable of a 1971 world mostly Catholic and at peace, ready for the Second Coming.  _The Lord of the World_ came first, in 1907, and was a darker vision.  A world of flying craft, major scientific advances, and comfort has become a place of materialist despair.  Euthanasia is routine, for the desperately ill and the terminally bored.  Oliver and Mabel Brand, a rising young couple, are the golden ones -- Oliver becomes a major political figure, but Mabel chooses the cool despairing end of legal euthanasia.  Father Percy Franklin is one of the last Catholic priests in a world hostile to freedom, church, university, and history.  Eventually elected the last Pope, he is restricted to the dusty forgotten village of Nazareth.  Julian Felsenburgh is a charismatic American adventurer who means to and does become Lord of the World, anti-Christ.  Details are less important than the very modern mood.  Believing in progress as the only good, people are swept into any movement that promises it.  The past is ruthlessly exterminated.  The quest for one world government that begins with Esperanto ends with one world dictatorship.	2002-09-01

The center of the book is Mary Ann Moffatt, variously refered to as Moffatt and (her name in religious life) Madame St. George.  Based on a single letter written by a disaffected and ambitious nun in September, 1837, three years after the attempt to murder the nuns and their young students, Schultz describes Moffatt as a proven alcoholic and implies lesbian affections.  Moffatt is repeatedly described from the point of view of the homicidal mob as a \\"termagant,\\" unfeminine, led into unlimited ambition by the regrettable decision of the Catholic Church to allow women education and leadership roles!   Schultz also implies that since a male teacher married one of his students, they had certainly had premarital sexual intercourse and at least one child born in the convent!  Proof?  None needed for the prejudiced.   <br />The book is badly written.  In her haste to be lurid but not just, Schultz confuses names.  She calls a woman at one time by her birth name, at another by her name in religion.  She skips back and forth.  She rarely examines evidence.  She is remarkably unfamiliar with Catholic practice, and calls ordinary prayers for the recovery of a dying nun \\"frenetic rituals\\" and \\"dangerous superstition.\\"  <br />The hero of Schultz' book is John Buzzell, the brave bricklayer who led a Boston mob to attack a few women and 50 young girls aged 6 to 14 (40 of the children Protestants) on an August night.  Since the intended murder victims escaped the flames, he and his companions looted and burned the buildings, and desecrated the bodies of dead nuns.  Acquitted by a Boston court, he was subsequently elected to the New Hampshire legislature for his abilities in arson, racism, and religious bigotry.  He died at 90, still bragging of his attempted murder of \\"the sauciest woman I ever heard talk.\\"	2002-08-09

Surprise!  Jack discovers he is the direct descendent of Edmund, who shared Winifred's disdain of the Commandments, and had illicit sexual relations with the stone-mason's daughter Alys.  He discovers Edmund stole an illuminated manuscript as well as abortifacient plants from the Abbey, to give to his pregnant mistress (apparently she was supposed to learn how to read and have an abortion at the same time).  Alys passed the baby off on her hastily acquired Norman French upperclass husband, Montfort, and handed the manuscript down through 900 years to Jack Montfort.   Got that far?  ALSO, the manuscript contains the \\"true\\" religious chant of Jesus, composed by pagan Egyptian priests and brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea in the 2nd century.  Unlike plain chant/<BR>Gregorian chant, this is the \\"real\\" thing, designed to produce trances, altered states of being, etc.  Quotes from Dion Fortune prove these channeled statements.

A great deal of emphasis is placed on Renquist's education and fluency in Latin, then he is impressed by dog-Latin in which he is called &quot;brothers in blood.&quot;  He seems to have been born to a Norman baron half a century before the Norman Conquest; Farren can't spell Norman or Saxon names.  &quot;Victor of Redlands&quot; in 1000 AD is left with ONLY a sword, suit of armor, and cavalry horse capable of carrying a mounted knight; that's like saying the illegitimate son was &quot;disinherited&quot; with only $ 50,000, a car, and a military education!

Or with a less-than-perfect road ambling gently over a  precipitous mountain!  This is a definite plus for the traveler's pocket.	2000-04-24
US	50738399	R1CG9K69E52DK2	0312209096	793079587	Skeleton Key	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Compassion and Crime	As usual, Jane Haddam delivers a very solid, enjoyable mystery with lively action and intellectual challenge.  The plot is believable, extremely interesting, and impossible to predict.  But she has added a very moving  and believable component in Bennis Hannaford's illness and Gregor  Demarkian's horror that a second beloved companion might die.  By now  Haddam's readers are involved in the lives of these characters.  One  complaint: After such a long wait, I'm greedy for the NEXT book!	2000-03-01

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Unconquerable Laughter	Lillian Beckwith's books frankly detail her experiences as a prim English schoolteacher encountering the uninhibited Hebrideans just after WW II.  After the first shocks of the vanishing china pattern (those delicate  yellow flowers were egg stains), the &quot;wee hoosies,&quot; and the daily  life in a primitive cottage, she spreads her wings.  She doesn't  romanticize the difficult lives of the islanders, but she enjoys them as  they enjoy life.  The books (all 6) are hilarious, compassionate, and  loving.  And they're back in print through the Akadine Press.  (ISBN  1-888173-42-4.)	1999-12-12
