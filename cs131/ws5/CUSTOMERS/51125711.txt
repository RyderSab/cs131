This book is intended for med students, and also for physician assistant students and nurse practitioner students.<br />The format of each chapter is as follows:<BR>- The title of each chapter comprises a symptom rather than a disease.<BR>- A synopsis about the symptom.<BR>- The possible differential diagnoses which you should think about with a short description of each one.<BR>- Learning how to take a focused history keeping in mind the purpose of each question.<BR>- Learning how to do a focused physical exam.<BR>- Suggesting what kind of tests you might do.<BR>-  Put it all together.<BR>-  Management.<br />There are 77 chapters distributed in 4 sections:<BR>I. Orientation to the office.<BR>II. Getting started in ambulatory patient care.<BR>III. Common signs, symptoms, and illnesses.<BR>IV. Common procedures in primary care.<br />There are many icons used in this book on the sidebar to indicate a brief definition of a technical term or brief description of a physical exam maneuver, red flags, hints, reminders, treatment options, and consultation and referral.<br />This book has many useful diagrams, black-and-white pictures, and tables.<br />It comes in a 392 pages; published by Hanley &amp; Belfus; 1st edition (2002).	2003-07-31

Most medical textbooks use the memory-based approach to present any disease i.e. prevalence, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, complications, management. This pocketbook contains a variety of cases which teach the approach physicians employ every day to evaluate symptoms, physical findings, and necessary tests to allow recognition of patterns of signs and symptoms for a certain disease. Let's face it. No one can memorize everything! The problem solving skills and pattern recognition allow us to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.<br />Features of this pocketbook:<br />-  It teaches med students how to &quot;think&quot; when they encounter common pediatric problems i.e. it teaches problem-solving skills.<br />-  The book contains 55 chapters (cases) e.g. rash (there're many case scenarios about rash in different age groups), congenital malformations, fall, cyanosis, abdominal mass, cough, sore throat, murmurs ...etc.<br />-  Each chapter starts with a chief complaint of a patient in a scenario, and then asks questions to help guide the diagnostic process.  A brief discussion follows about the history and physical exam which help rule out other possible diseases. Treatment is presented at the end with the follow-up.<br />-  Sidebars provide the &quot;pearls&quot; from each case and reminders of important facts.<br />-  No pictures, no diagrams, no tables.<br />-  Sometimes the discussion of the differential diagnoses is insufficient and you feel you need to learn more.<br />-  There are many other diseases which were not addressed, but I guess if they write about them then it won't be called \\"pocketbook\\" anymore.<br />- This book comes in 282 pages; published by Fence Creek Pub; 1st edition (1999).	2003-07-31

Since I'm very interested in learning teaching skills required for a resident, I bought this book at the Toronto Bookstore and added it to my Teaching Skill series.<br />Today your Attending physician (or the Consultant) does not have enough time to teach the medical students. Some of them start to ask you many questions. Now the burden lies on you as a resident to teach them, but you are hesitant to do so ! You're worried about how to deliver the message using a simple and easy-to-follow method for teaching them.<BR>Another scenario, you are on-call, and you ask your clinical clerk a question but she does not seem to be interested in answering you, since she is exhausted. The question is (How do you recognize the \\"teachabe moment\\"?).<BR>As we can see, residents play an important role as teachers.  In fact, they are responsible for as much as 80% of student teaching. They will be attending physicians one day, and they will have to teach medical students and other residents too. Teaching and communicating are a requirements for the competency of a physician. Now a question is raised (Who will teach the teachers?)<br />This book effecienctly provides practical guidance to plan, organize, and run a teaching skills program for medical residents.<br />It's well referenced and uses the most recent research in learning theories and clinical teaching strategies.<br />- The only obvious drawback of this book is its complicated language. Sometimes I had to re-read a paragraph to understand what te author wants to say.<br />This book is divided int 2 Parts:<br />Part 1 (Information and ideas) covers many chapters including:<BR>(Sir William Osler), (Social learning theory and the development of clinical performance), (Clinical teaching techniques for residents), (Observing, developing, and reflecting on residents' teaching strategies), (Planning and implementing a teaching-skills improvement program for residents), (Residents as teachers: evaluating programs and performance), and (Interpretation and projections).<br />Part 2 (Materials for teaching-skills programs) covers 4 sections:<br />A). The role of the senior resident team: team manager, leader, and teacher.<BR>Introduction, Course background and evaluation, Course description, Development of a resident teaching skills course, Teaching course Manual for residents, Supervising patient care, Attending interactions, Resident as teacher, Micro-skills of teaching, Feedback and evaluation, Problem behaviors in residents, Substance use, Sexual harassment and gender discrimination.<br />Section B.  Teaching materials for pediatric residents: three modules.<BR>Module I: The student-teacher relationship.<BR>Module II: Teaching in small groups.<BR>Module III: Giving and receiving feedback.<br />Section C.  Teaching skills modules.<br />Section D.  Forms for evaluation of resident teaching-skills programs and resident performance.<br />It is the 1st edition (2002), and comes in 254 pages; published by Springer Pub Co, in a hardcover copy.<br />This book is recommended for Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the medical field, interns, residents, chief residents and Program Directors.<br />Another book I would recommend is (Teaching Tips: Strategies, Reseach, and Theory for College and University Teachers), 11th ed, 2002, for Wilbert J. McKeachie. This book uses simpler language and information, but it's not directed toward medical educators. However, I found it also very useful.<br />Enjoy reading & learning from this book !	2003-05-29

It gives you the most important issues in points rather than full text, which increases your efficiency with little effort! Its USMLE-case-type questions focus more on the treatment. I wish there could be more questions to give us more practice for the exam. It includes introduction to Anesthesiology, but unfortunately not Urology &amp; Orthopedic surgery. In addition, it doesn't have many pictures or diagrams e.g. x-rays, diseases mechanisms.	2003-05-04

Most Junior Medical Students (JMS's) feel intimidated when they begin their clinical year of medical school.  You wanna learn how to cope up with this stress? Then buy this pocketbook !<BR>Even though I bought it from Dalhousie University (Halifax) at the end of my junior clinical year, yet it was of great help to me later.<br />This pocketbook explores the world of the hospital, the role of each member, and how things are done in terms of writing notes, ordering tests, and performing procedures.<br />In Chapter 1, it introduces the JMS's to how a hospital works: (Outpatient vs. inpatient care, community vs. teaching hospitals, Private &amp; staff patients, Nursing units &amp; specialty services, Physician teams, Getting admitted to the hospital, Night calls, Ward routines from a patient's perspective).<br />Then the author talks in Chapter 2 about how to do stuff including reviewing a chart, writing orders, medications and prescriptions.<br />Chapter 3 teaches how to write notes (admission notes, internal medicine daily progress notes, discharge notes, notes for the Surgical care, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Neurology and Psychiatry).<br />Chapter 4 focuses on procedures, in terms of preparation, introduction to phlebotomy &amp; IV placement, performing venipuncture, taking blood culture, arterial blood gases, ECG, lumbar puncture, NG tube &amp; Dobhoff placement, placing a urinary catheter, and local anesthesia.<br />Chapter 5 deals with bedside tests including urinalysis and Gram stain.<br />Finally Chapter 6 teaches JMS's how to organize their data and schedule, and to make a good presentation.<br />This pocketbook comes in 124 pages, published by Tarascon Press, in its 6th edition, 2001.<br />The only drawback I found is that chapter 3 is entirely duplicated twice, at least in my copy. Other than that, I strongly recommend this pocketbook for med students before commencing their clinical clerkships.	2003-02-21

Then I decided to buy it in a Book Exhibition, and discovered the reason later!<br />This handbook stresses on the development of communication,  observational and instincual skills. The approach is essentially clinical i.e. confined largely to symptoms and signs. <br />The used language is very simple, and the handbook uses numerous graphs, funny pictures, and boxes containing special pediatric terminology with which the student may experience difficulty.<br />The first few chapters use a child-centered clinical approach towards problem solving in pediatrics.<br />There are 11 chapters:  Introduction, History taking, Approaching children, Examination at different ages, Systems examination, A measure of progress, Hydration and nutrition, Development assessment, Examining excreta, Using your senses, Pediatric tips and topics.<br />The last chapter (Pediatric tips and topics) is very attractive and contains very useful information.  It covers (Normal findings, Tools of the trades, Tricks of the trade, Biological warning signs, Clinical curios, Rules of thumb, Maternal myths, Acrimonious acronyms, A-Z eponyms, Alarm signals, Memorable mnemonics, and others ...)<br />This handbook comes in 251 pages, and the last edition was the 3rd (1998).<br />I strongly advise you to buy and read it when you have a free time in the ward.	2003-02-18

It is organized in a compact, user-friendly design with the primary purpose to present a condensed and practical guide to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of pediatric diseases.  It provides essential information for the med students, house officers, and physicians.<br />Features:<br />- This handbook is written by pediatric trainees, for pediatric trainees!<br />- It is organized into sections: I. Emergencies, II. Systems (including 30-system based chapters), III. Procedures, IV. Laboratory Reference Values, V. Formulary.  Beside the systems chapters, I liked section III (Procedures) becuase it's very informative with some diagrams for clarification.<br />- It has numerous charts, graphs, and tables.<br />- It is considered a quick reference handbook for pediatric trainees, therefore it does not replace contemporary textbooks of Pediatrics.<br />- The last edition of this handbook was in 1997, in 663 pages. I hope it will have a new edition in the near future.<br />Last but not least, I thank that med student at the University of Toronto who advised me to buy it.	2003-02-18

Most medical students are hesitant to choose their medical specialty. No book until now has solved this dilemma in a proper way except this one! I was asking myself this question before graduation, and I saw this book at the Toronto Bookstore 2 years ago, but didn't want to buy it cuz one of my friends told me that there were many web sites which will help you choose your future specialty. Unfortunately, I didn't find a comprehensive book or at an article or a website about that. Then after graduation, I had the chance to visit Toronto Bookstore again and decided this time to buy it!<br />Part I: The Challenge of Specialty Choice including (Planning your specialty choice, Finding a speciality that is right for you, Considering your options, Career planning in an uncertain world).<br />Part II: The Specialties and Subspecialties including: Allergy and immunology, Anesthesiology, Colon and rectal surgery, Dermatology, Emergency medicine, Family medicine, Internal medicine (Cardiology, Endocrinology and metabolism, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Infectious diseases, Medical oncology, Nephrology, Pulmonary disease, Rheumatology), Medical genetics, Neurological surgery, Neurology, Nuclear medicine, Obstetric and gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedic surgery, Otolaryngology - Head and nech surgery, Pathology, Pediatrics, Physical medicine and rehabilitation, Plastic surgery, Preventive medicine, Psychiatry, Radiation oncology, Diagnostic radiology, Thoracic surgery, Urology.<br />A composite picture of each specialty is drawn in terms of (General information, Residency information, American Board of medical specialties certification, Supply and projections, Economic status and types of practice, Further information, Why choose this specialty, What do you like most about this specialty, What do you like least about this specialty, What is your typical daily schedule, What abilities and talents are important in this specialty, what personality traits best characterize this specialty, what advice would you give to medical students interested in this specialty, what are the future challenges to this specialty, Job values of this specialty)<br />Part III: Emerging Specialty Areas including: (Addiction medicine, Administrative medicine, Adolescent medicine, Critical care medicine, Geriatric medicine, Hospice and palliative medicine, Sports medicine, Women's health).<br />Part IV: Practice Options inlcuding (Clinical pathways, Non-clinical pathways, Geographic location).<br />Part V: After You Have Chosen a Specialty including (Planning for residency, Military programs, The couples match, Shared-schedule residencies, What happens if you don't match, Changing specialties during residency and afterwards).<br />Appendix which contains: Quesionnaire, First-year postgraduate positions offered through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), Residency competitiveness tables, Summary profile scores, Selected web sites.<br />This book comes in 331 pages. I hope there will be an update for it since its last 3rd edition (1999). However, it is the MOST comprehensive and useful book for medical students. I sincerely advise every med student to buy it.<br />Great work Dr. Anita Taylor. Keep up the good work!	2003-02-10

I found it in a Book Exhibition, and decided to buy it since the title attracted me.<BR>It's really useful when you learn how to attract attention of people which is very important in our daily life.<BR>This book is concise, user-friendly and uses simple language for conveying the auther's message.<br />Part (1) is an introduction about the importance of the first impression.  There is an old saying which is true most of the time (The first impression is the last impression.) All what you need is to adopt a positive attitude, make sure your words, tone, and gestures are in harmony, and use your gift in organizing your speech to maintain an attractive conversation by using open-ended questions to try to discover what the other person likes.<br />Part (2) focuses on the first 90 seconds for establishing a rapport.  As Mr. Boothman said, the key to establish a rapport with people is to learn how to be like them.<br />Part (3) is talking about the secrets of interactions. I was amazed when I learned that some people rely on visual cues, others on auditory or kinesthetic (touch) input.  You just should try to discover what the other person prefers and use it to your best advantage! After doing the exercise to determine my favorite sense, it came out to be (Visual)! The author gives us some exercises for determining the characteristics of the people whose favorable senses are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. <br />Keep in you mind that your reward at the end will be the acceptance of the other person for your personality.<br />However, I agree with some reviewers that there are few points which were not clarified in this book:<br />1. emphasizing on general appearance.<BR>2. exploring coversational techniques.<BR>3. overcoming shyness for some people.<BR>4. speaking to more than 1 person.<br />In summary, I recommend this book for anybody who is interested in the &quot;psychology&quot; of howto give a good impression in 90 seconds or less!<br />Well done Mr. Boothman!	2003-02-08

These are an excellent pocket-sized study cards (44 cards), which have the basic information for residents and medical students.<br />One of the best features is that each card has its own independent information  e.g. 1 card only about delirium, or, 1 card about OCD, which makes it easy if you want to revise just one disorder.<br />Most of the cards start with the (Interview & Assessment), (Physical exam & lab test), (Treatment options including drug tables listing dosages and side effects), (Management principles & clinical course), and finally (Key diagnostic features).<br />The only disavantage in my opinion is the lack of spiral which can hold all the cards together, otherwise you might lose one or two cards during the ward round.<br />Contents of the cards include:<BR>Psychiatric history & physical including neurologic exam, Mental Status exam & Mini mental state exam, DSM-IV axis diagnosis, Delirium, Dementia, Psychosis, Schizophrenia and related disorders, Antipsychotic drugs, Panic disorder, Anxiolytic drugs, Specific and social phobias, OCD, GAS, Post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, Depression & Dysthymia & Adjustment disorder, Drugs used to treat depression, Bipolar I & II & Cyclothymia, Drugs used to treat mania, Anorexia & Bulimia, The suicidal patient, Insomnia & dyatime sleepiness, Somatization disorder, Psychogenic pain disorder, Drug-induced movement disorders, Smoking cessation, Alcohol addiction & abuse, Drus used for nicotine/ETOH withdrawal, Signs of intoxication & withdrawal, Personality disorders, Mental retardation & intelligence, The psychotherapies, Vocabulary definitions, biography, Scales (including: Yale-Brown OCD scale, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, Beck depression inventory, Hamilton depression scale, Epworth sleepiness scale, Madison scale, AIMS scale, Simpson-Angus rating scale, Fagerstrom tolerance test, CAGE questionnare, Brief MAST).	2003-01-01

I'm very interested in Egyptology, and I was surprised that she also wrote a novel about a crime which happened in Ancient Egypt!<br />The characters are: Esa, Henet, Hori, Imhotep (a wealthy priest-landowner), Ipy, Kait, Kameni, Khay, Divine Father Mersu, Montu, Nofret, Renisenb, Satipy, Sobek, Teti, and Yahmose<br />It is Ancient Egypt in 2000 BC, where death gives meaning to life. At the foot of a cliff lies the broken, twisted body of Nofret, concubine to a Ka-priest. Young, beautiful and venomous, most agree that she deserved to die like a snake. <br />Yet Renisenb, the priest's daughter, believes that the woman's death was not fate, but murder. Increasingly, she becomes convinced that the source of evil lurks within her own father's household. Murders ensue; another falls off a cliff, one drowns, another is suffocated with linen, two are poisoned, and one person is killed by an arrow.<br />Esa (Imhotep's mother) is an old lady, who has a good experience in life, and has a strong personality over Imhotep. She is brilliant, but commits a fatal mistake at the end! No wonder, didn't she say (Death comes at the end)?<br />As usual, Agatha convinces us that someone has all the evidences that convict him/her. But someone else unexpected has the gut to commit all these serial crimes. Who is the criminal? I won't spoil it. Read the novel &amp; you'll be surprised at the end!	2001-11-15

All in all, I advise to read it as a review book.<br />GOOD features of this book include:<br />1.  The info are presented in an outline format for quick reading.<br />2.  Patient snapshots to provide clinical scenarios.<br />3.  It covers most important aspects of any subject (but not all).<br />4.  You can answer say 75% of the NBME exam, the other 25% can  be achieved through discussion of many cases in the ward focussing on the management, and further readings from different book(s). <br />DRAWBACKS include:<br />1.  No index!!<br />2.  Very important subjects, which come frequently in the exam, are not discussed e.g. Suicide &amp; Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH), Puerperal psychiatric disorders, psychiatric aspects of epilepsy.<br />3.  Many significant subjects were mentioned briefly though they come frequently in the NBME exam e.g. some child psychiatric disorders, bipolar disorders (even the clinical features of mania are not clearly mentioned!!).  Concerning abused substances, signs &amp; symptoms of their use &amp; withdrawal are put in a memorizable rather than undertandable way, that's why I had to read from Lippincott's Pharmacology to understand their mechanism of action in order to predict the clinical features.  Furthermore, alcohol abuse is discussed briefly, despite its great significance!<br />4.  DSM-IV criteria for some disorders are not fully mentioned. That's why you might notice yourself missing important points in a case-scenario question.<br />5.  I wish there could be a chapter on Genetics, to recapitulate &amp; emphasize the genetic bases of psychiatric disorders.<br />There are 30 chapters which include: Classification of Psychiatric Disorders, The Clinical Interview &amp; Mental status, Diagnostic Tests, Normal Child Development &amp; Attention-Deficit &amp; Disruptive Behavior Disorders, Childhood Mental Disorders, &quot;Aging, Geriatric Psychiatry, Death &amp; Bereavement&quot;, Child &amp; Adult Abuse &amp; Neglect, Normal Sleep &amp; Sleep Disorders, Cognitive Disorders, Substance-related Disorders, Schizophrenia, Other Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, &quot;Somatoform Disorders, Facticious Disorders, &amp; Malingering&quot;, Sexual &amp; Gender Identity Disorders, Obesity &amp; Eating Disorders, Impulse-Control Disorders, Adjustment Disorders, Personality Disorders, Psychosomatic Medicine, Medication-Induced Psychiatric Symptoms, Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis &amp; Related Therapies, Behavioral &amp; Cognitive Therapies, &quot;Group, Family, &amp; Marital Therapies&quot;, Legal Issues in Psychiatry &amp; Medicine, Ethical Issues in Psychiatry &amp; Medicine.	2001-05-25

It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.<br />The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).<br />This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables.	2001-04-17
