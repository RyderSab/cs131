This book did a really good job in describing why God truly is in the small stuff.  These guys talk about various aspects of life, such as parenting, marriage, faith, the Word of God, managing money, being a listener, being an encourager, etc.  I especially liked the \\"proverbs\\" at the end of each chapter, with the various words of wisdom pertaining to each topic.  I really enjoyed this book.	2005-06-24

I felt that there were some good things about this book.  We do need to take responsibility for our actions, not remain a victim, and to realize that sin is sin and that God can forgive it all.  Surprisingly, the submission chapter was done well, explaining the myths of submission and how a woman in an abusive situation should get out. <br /> <br />But there were many things I didn't like in this book.  First, the author took a patronizing, critical, judging tone towards women.  She seemed to like to blame women for a lot of problems, without recognizing the role that men often play in those problems. <br /> <br />I was deeply offended about what she had to say about how \\"a career is more fulfilling than being a wife and mother\\".  I do agree with that statement.  But she uses that statement to imply that the only place for the woman is in the home.  She blames working women (\\"in part\\") for affairs, women being on welfare (I thought working took women OFF welfare), elderly parent being in nursing homes, divorce, single motherhood, teen violence, etc.  She doesn't acknowledge other factors going into those things.  I mean, men and women have had affairs since the beginning of time.  Elderly parents are in nursing homes because they require 24/7 care, not because of the women working (don't sons or SAHM's put their parents in nursing homes?)  I work outside the homes, yet, I do have meals with my family and they aren't all fast food or frozen.  As far as women gaining financial independence to free them to leave their husbands...I don't know of many women who work for that purpose.  But isn't it OK for each woman to have her own money in cases of abuse, addiction, or when the man leaves them for someone else?  What if the husband loses his job, becomes disabled, dies, etc?  And the Proverbs 31 woman did a little of everything, including working out of the home.   <br /> <br />And yes, children are a blessing, but Demoss seems to think it is wrong to limit the number of children a woman has.  She comes from a family of 7 kids, and that's great that her mom enjoyed raising 7 kids, but that is not for everyone.  The reasons that Demoss gives--not having patience, not being able to physically handle more kids--are perfectly legitimate reasons, that she appeared to mock.  Other than the issue of abortion, the Bible doesn't say that limiting the number of children is a sin, just like it is not a sin for women to work outside the home. <br /> <br />And on emotions, she seems to act like it is a sin to call for pizza when you don't feel like cooking (guess I sinned tonight, after my stressful day at work) or not cleaning house when you don't feel like it.  And about passive husbands...what if the husband is an alcoholic and can't hold or look for a job?  What is the wife to do?  Let her and her children starve? <br /> <br />Although there were some good points to the book, I had a problem with many of the issues presented.  If anyone were to go through the book, please go through it with a group to work out the trouble spots. <br />	2005-05-24

I thought she made some good points about praying before making a decision, how we sometimes treat other people better than our families, etc. <br /> <br />She did seem to put a lot of emphasis on the woman being in the home and on works, like having a nice home at all times, always having dinner on the table when her husband comes home, checking your dayplanner in bed, and always being on her feet.  I didn't feel that I could relate to that, especially with two small kids. <br /> <br />But George is clearly a Godly woman, and she shows it through this book.  She has a gentle way of presenting the truth in a kind manner.  And most of what she says was on target. <br />	2005-05-24

You have Cody, whose father abandoned him because of his Down's Syndrome brother.  He becomes a bull rider and is into fast living until he meets Ali.  Ali's sister died at an early age, some Ali lives out her sister's dream of being a horse rider.  The problem is that she is battling cystic fibrosis. <br /> <br />The love story between Ali and Cody is beautiful.  It is so obvious how much they love each other.  Through Ali, Cody learns to love and he eventually forgives his father for abandoning his family. <br /> <br />The book is short, yet, there is so much depth to the storyline and characters.  And Kingsbury has obviously done a lot of research on cystic fibrosis and how terrible the disease is.   <br /> <br />Yes, the book doesn't make Scripture references like in her other books, but you can demonstrate Christian concepts without always quoting verses.  This book seemed to reach out to all audiences, Christian and secular, without all the smut. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  It is a real tear jerker. <br />	2005-05-24

I did like the humor, but there didn't seem to be much depth to the characters or the storylines.  It seemed that the main point of the guys was to get a woman and the women were church-hopping just to find a man.  It was like THE most important thing.  And that all seemed to ignore the point of going to church--to worship God among believers. <br /> <br />It seemed whenever a storyline or character looked promising, the author seemed to stop exploring yet.  I started to take an interest in Neil and Alexis when they talked about their parents, how Alexis was rejected by her father.  But after the one conversation, the storyline didn't develop.  The same with Darcy and her parents, who threatened to cut her off because of her Christian beliefs.  I thought the fire at the missionary story showed promise, but that seemed to end and didn't seem to indicate that it would go anywhere. <br /> <br />So, I was not to excited about this book.  Others might enjoy it though.  At least the humor and the relationships were clean, and not trashy as in a lot of books these days. <br /> <br />	2005-05-24

Hanna is struggling with a rape and Micah is struggling with scars  <br />(literally and figuratively) from his childhood.  The two make an interesting discovery about the other, but can they save  <br />their budding relationship?  I loved how this author brought the two broken souls together, talking about the need to  <br />forgive, and how they need each other to heal. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  That book will focus more on Natalie, who was introduced in \\"Mending Places\\", but I'm still hoping to get a glimpse into Hanna and Micah's life and how they work through their relationship.  The  <br />author did such a good job making it clear how much the two loved each other.	2005-05-02

It was sooooo funny. <br /> <br />In this book, Ashley is a single, 31 year old workaholic who is wanting to find a husband.  She is constantly worried that she will never get married.  She then ends up interracting with 3 different guys in this book and finds true love with one of them. <br /> <br />First, I loved the humor in this book.  It was hilarious, especially when she gets arrested, has to leave her apartment because there are rats, and then her stuff from her apartment gets stolen.  It is one thing after another, and then she ends up quitting her job as well.  I thought that her brother's wedding was hilarious, especially when she was cracking up at the wedding over the \\"intertwining\\" thing. <br /> <br />But the book had its serious moments.  First, her friend had to remind Ashley that not everything was about her.  Then we see parts of Ashley's character when she comes across as judgmental.  She comes to assumptions about her new Asian sister-in-law to be, only to find out that Mei Ling is actually a really terrific person who helped lead Ashley's brother to Christ.    <br /> <br />Ashley then realizes that it's not about herself, about finding a man, her job, etc.  It is about finding God's will in her life.	2005-04-26

This was book was about several women and how two of them came to know Christ. <br /> <br />First, there is Catherine.  She can be such a mean-spirited, outspoken woman, to the point where she doesn't care who she hurts.  No wonder her husband wants little to do with her and her kids don't respect her. <br /> <br />Then there is the eccentric Della Boyd, who comes to stay with the Biddles after a fire destroys her home.   <br /> <br />Then there is the level headed Barb, who was wild in her younger day, until she comes to Christ. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the characters.  It was easy to see how Catherine came to be so mean.  But then something happens that changes Catherine.  And I loved how the author showed Catherine's pain and anguish over that incident and how that changed her attitude towards her kids. <br /> <br />And I loved Della Boyd.  She raised her younger brother (Catherine's husband), got her teaching degree, and bent over backwards to help out Catherine, even though Catherine acted so mean to her. <br /> <br />I liked the friendship type of evangelism shown by Barb and her family.  They reached out to everybody in the Biddle family.  That was neat how the Biddles were eventually turning towards Christ and coming together as a family <br /> <br />A very good and interesting book.	2005-04-26

The book toured the various stores throughout Indiana, with short interviews from the owners of the stores.  The book talked about the struggles that general stores go  <br />through to stay open (government regulations, competition from the big stores like WalMart, having to keep prices high,  <br />etc.), yet, people still like general stores because they are homey and the customer service is more personable. <br /> <br />Makes me want to go and visit some of these stores. <br /> <br />	2005-04-06

I've read her other books and really enjoyed them.  I know is was her first book (or one of her firsts).  But she was a little too wordy. <br /> <br />I liked the storyline of Perry, who is writing a book on \\"fundamentalist Christians\\".  He visits a church and is pleasantly surprised by what he finds.  He meets the eccentric Eldeen, who shows him what God and Christianity was really all about.   <br /> <br />I loved the character of Eldeen.  I loved how Perry discovered that Christianity is not all about rules, and how some of what he learned about God was helpful in his relationship with his estranged wife. <br /> <br />But the book was so wordy that I got lost in all the details.  There was a lot of going back and forth between past and present, and that got confusing.  Because of the wordiness, I almost missed that Joe Leonard was Jewel's son. <br /> <br />There also seemed to be some loose ends.  It looked like certain things would develop, but then the author seemed to stop.  There was the relationship between Perry and his mother.  What was wrong with his mother?  She cried frequently and seemed emotionally unbalanced.  There was mention of her going away and nobody telling Perry why.  Was it because she was depressed and spent time in a mental hospital?  Why did Perry's dad collapse?  That seemed buried in all the details of the book.  It would have been interesting to develop this more since this seemed to affect Perry, who he was, and how he related to his wife. <br /> <br />And what happened to Jewel's mother?  It was mentioned that Eldeen married Jewel's daddy when Jewel was 6, but I thought some mention of what happened to Jewel's mother would come up. <br /> <br />This author clearly has potential.  I am currently reading \\"By the Light of a Thousand Stars\\" and am really enjoying the book.  I think without the excessive wordiness, the book wouldhave been easier to read.	2005-03-28

There is always so much written about Laura.  It was great hearing about Carrie and Grace, and their lives.  It is interesting that Carrie had such a career in the newspaper business, then married in her 40's with an already made family!

Nora does not seem to be at all  <br />accepting towards her daughter.  Tess takes off after having her baby, leaving her (Tansy) for her parents to raise.  It  <br />turns out that Nora doesn't disapprove of her daughter.  She is suffering from her own trauma of having an abortion many  <br />years ago.   <br /> <br />I thought this was a very good book overall.  I loved the reconciliation theme towards the end with Tess, and admire Tess for her decision to chose life for her unborn baby.  I liked the character of Ben and how he seemed to be there for Tess. <br /> <br />At times, some of the dialog seemed a little stilted.  The only other thing that I didn't like was that nobody seemed to like  <br />Tess.  Nora didn't seem to like Tess, Creede was annoyed with Tess, Creede's father was disapproving of Tess, and the church  <br />ladies were disapproving of Tess.  Yeah, Ben stood up for her, but it seemed that everyone was too hard on her.  It would  <br />have been nice to see someone reaching out to Tess, to help her go in the right direction but in a loving manner. <br /> <br />The book also mentioned something about Nora discovering the truth about herself and her abortion.  I didn't really seem to  <br />grasp what that truth was.  Was it guilt?  Was she disapproving of Tess because of the guilt over her own abortion?  This  <br />part seemed rushed towards the end. <br /> <br />Bedford interwove her own abortion experience into the book, so she knows what a woman who has had an abortion goes through.   <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.	2005-02-18

The book shows how Annie and Sam try to move on, but you can sense that they are not complete without the other.   <br /> <br />This book was set in the mountains of Tennesee.  You can feel the beauty of that area throughout the book.

We have Sam and Jessica, who recently lost a baby, when a child from the community's group home spends some time with them.  And on the lighter side, we have Emily and Dan, trying to come to an agreement on the size of their wedding, with Lillian putting in her two cents worth. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the storylines in this book.

I thought this was a wonderful book. <br /> <br />I thought this book gave a really good idea as to how a family struggles when a family member is seriously ill, as is the  <br />case with Dana.  The book was told from Dana's sister's point of view, to give insight about how family members cope with an  <br />illness like cancer. <br /> <br />The book showed Dad, who is struggling with finances and has to make some tough decisions.  There is Mom, who is exhausted  <br />from taking care of Dana and the other kids in the family.  There is Corey, the baby of the family, who feels left out and  <br />just wants a puppy.  There is older brother Brett, who ends up distancing himself from the family.  And then there is Erin,  <br />whose point of view the book is told.  She is taking care of Corey while her mother takes care of Dana.  Erin reaches a point  <br />of frustration, feeling angry at God for Dana's illness, feeling like her teenage years are robbed by the illness, missing  <br />out on her basketball tournament to take care of Corey when Dana got sick, etc. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was that I did feel that Erin was \\"punished\\" a little bit for her anger.  She had  <br />a right to feel angry.  Her sister was sick, she missed out on her teenage years, and a lot of the burden was placed on Erin.  <br />It might have been good to include a scene in the book, where Mom and Dad express appreciation for Erin's hard work and  <br />acknowledgement on how hard things are on her.  A serious illness can affect a person deeply. <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoyed the book.  I highly recommend this book. <br />	2005-01-24

This book dealt with a woman who was struggling to get her sister and niece out of an  <br />abusive situation.   <br /> <br />This book was just about the abusive situation.  The book also talked about Lillie's struggles with her love life and about  <br />her quirky set of friends.  They were so fun to read about.  And I liked the balance in the book, between something so horrible as abuse, but as fun as friends and romance. <br /> <br />I love the humor in the book.  I really loved how 6 year old Lillie was envisioning \\"skeletons in her closet\\".   <br /> <br />Samson creates such unique characters in her books.  Many books portray characters who are so glamorous.  Samson's characters  <br />may not be the most glamorous, but her characters are everyday people with quirks just like everyone else. <br /> <br />I also loved how she interwove life in communist Hungary into the book, and the story of Lillie's mother's escape from  <br />Hungary.

Doug was struggling with his addiction to  <br />pornography, and Sherry was struggling to come to terms with that.  Then there was Ronnie.  She ran away from an abusive home  <br />to Atlanta, where she got a job in a strip joint.  Eventually, she got promoted to stripper.  And throughout the book was  <br />this massive terrorist plot, involving Ronnie, Doug, and Sherry, and their friends. <br /> <br />This book was incredible.  The book showed that no matter how far away we stray from God, He loves us and is waiting for us.   <br />It doesn't matter what our past is.  It doesn't matter if we are a prostitute or addict.  God is there for us.  The grace  <br />message was brought out great. <br /> <br />This book was very suspenseful as we waited for the terrorist plot to play out.  We had some surprises in the book, including  <br />Marco and Maris. <br /> <br />Some of the characters were annoying.  Melanie was really annoying, when she seemed to think that church activities should  <br />take priority over family.  She was also very judgmental.  I loved how Sherry put her in her place, when Melanie was  <br />criticizing some couple in church for being in marriage counseling.  Sherry told her that maybe they have a better marriage because they are willing to go to counseling and work on their problems. <br /> <br />The book showed how rampant sexual addiction was in the church.  Everybody seems so perfect in the church, yet, we are all so  <br />flawed in some way. <br /> <br />This was a well written book.  I will be looking for more books by this author.	2004-11-19

This book was about 2 people with troubled pasts, who end up living next door to each other. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the characters in the book.  They were very well developed, people that you can easily relate to.  We all have  <br />things in our past that we are ashamed of, but being a Christian does not make you immune.  I enjoy the author's writing  <br />style a great deal.  She has a poetic way of writing.   <br /> <br />Sometimes, the past-present switch throughout the book got a little confusing.  It was difficult, at times, to determine if  <br />she was referring to something now or in the past.   <br /> <br />The book was also a little wordy, which made it hard to follow the storyline. <br /> <br />I also would have liked to see more on how Celia and Bruce resolved the ghosts of the past.  It seemed to end a little  <br />abruptly.  I do agree with the reviewer who said that the author took the reader to the peaking point, then changed scenes  <br />from Celia's story to Bruce's.   <br /> <br />But overall, the book was very enjoyable and interesting to read.	2004-11-03

Lorri and Josie were on the plane towards the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of the next chapter, Rigg found Lorri on the island.  That seemed so disjointed.   <br /> <br />What happened in between the time when the plane crashed and Rigg had found Lorri?  I know that there's probably not much that happens when stranded on an island alone, but what was Lorri feeling?  What lessons were Lorri learning from the Lord?  There was some discussion about how Lorri survived on the island, but it wasn't well developed.  And when the plane was crashing, what all happened?  What were Lorri and Josie going through? <br /> <br />And the book was set in WWII.  Maybe more about the time period would have made the book more interesting. <br /> <br />The characters didn't seem to be as well developed.  Normally, Wick does a good job describing characters, but I didn't see that in here as well.  Plus, the characters do seem one-dimensional, almost too perfect. <br /> <br />I liked reading books on good Christian romances.  But this book didn't hold my interest like the others that Wick has written.	2004-10-15

She talks about dealing with moods, kids, things from the past, weight, etc. <br /> <br />I liked the suggestion of making lists.  Having lists and a set of goals is very useful in trying to get over a hurdle in life.  I also loved the letter that she wrote to her friend, who dealt with issues from her childhood.  It was such a beautiful letter, not minimizing her pain but wanting to be helpful. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't care about was the title.  The title seemed to imply that this book was about marriage, yet, the book wasn't really about that at all. <br /> <br />But I did enjoy the book very much and would recommend it.	2004-10-08

The book focused on Ashley and Landon's wedding, Elizabeth's struggle with cancer, and Erin trying to adopt a baby, as well as Dane and how he fit into the Baxter family. <br /> <br />This book showed how much Elizabeth and John truly love each other.  They have gone through so much.  It is revealed in this book a secret that they shared from before they got married.  The 2 stood by each other then and now, through Elizabeth's illness.  I loved how Elizabeth managed to stay with the Lord, through her frustration and to the end.   <br /> <br />The theme in this book is about reuniting family.  That is showed so well, with all of the Baxters gathering for Ashley's wedding and supporting each other through all sorts of trials.  This book gives a great example of how families should stick together, as a good family gives each other so much support.  I would have loved growing up in this family.  They went through so many trials, but they always had each other. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading the Firstborn series, and reading more about Dane.	2004-10-08
US	51263439	R5FDZP8ZMS1JW	0764226770	255174692	Coming Home	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Enjoyed the book!	This book focused on Jessie, who is struggling with many ghosts of the pasts, in somewhat of a literal way.  Her mother had a  <br />terrible disease and supposedly died.  Yet, something is just not quite right about what happened to her mother.  So she  <br />returns to her grandmother's and tries to figure out what exactly happened to her mother. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the book.  All the pain that Jessie struggled with, being separated from her mother, was so traumatic, and  <br />that showed right through in this book.  The anger directed towards Jessie's grandmother was so easy to relate to, as it came out so well in this book.  But in the end, Jessie's grandmother turned out to be a rather loveable character who Jessie was able to forgive.  Her grandmother did the best she could with Jessie's mother, and with Jessie. <br /> <br />And I loved the character of Jessie's childhood friend, Andy.  He was willing to stick by Jessie, no matter what.  Andy's  <br />parents tried to discourage marriage between Andy and Jessie, but Andy was determined to stand by Jessie, no matter the  <br />future.  And his questions about faith...so real.  We all struggle through doubts at times. <br /> <br />And the tragedy of Jessie's father's death came out so well, too.  He obviously loved Jessie's mother very much and was very  <br />devastated when she became end. <br /> <br />The ending was beautiful in many ways.  I wish I can tell you about it, but it might spoil the book for you. <br />	2004-09-24

Aurora struggles with strange dreams, visions, and memories, and with agoraphobia. <br /> <br />I thought all of the symbolism in this book was very interesting.  The memory of Aurora's father telling Aurora's mother, that she wanted nothing to do with love because she wanted nothing to do with faithfulness, was interesting.  That parallels our relationship with Christ, when sometimes, we aren't as faithful to Him, and we can't feel His love at times.  I thought the book written within this book, I Know She Weeps was very interesting as well, about the love between father and daughter.  I thought that strongly paralleled our relationship to Christ as well. <br /> <br />The characters were great in this book.  I loved Phil and his sense of humor when Aurora played \\"Walked Like An Egyptian\\" in the middle of the night as a way for Aurora to cope with her dreams.  I loved how Phil was there for Aurora.  I also got so aggravated at Clara for not letting Aurora be an adult.  The characters were written so well. <br /> <br />And the ending was great, as Aurora did find love.  The book focused on a lot on love, but not in a \\"boyfriend/girlfriend\\" sort of way. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more books by Angela Hunt.	2004-09-20

Robin Lee Hatcher did a very good job of bringing her experiences with a loved one with alcoholism into this book.  I could relate to a lot of the book because I was once in a relationship with an alcoholic.  I could relate to the anger and pain that Deborah felt, the covering up of the problem, pouring out the booze, etc.  This book is real and I highly recommend it to someone with a loved one who is an alcoholic.	2004-09-10

The theme of this book is about  <br />forgiveness.  We see many examples of this through:  forgiving the woman who robbed the prayer group, the mother of the boy  <br />that Jodi accidently killed, and MaDear and what she went through when her brother was murdered. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the book.  It was very uplifting.  I loved the humor in the book.  And I loved the forgiveness theme.   <br />MaDear thought that Denny was the man who lynched her brother.  At the end of the book, that situation was resolved  <br />beautifully.   <br /> <br />This author describes very well the relationships today between the various races.  Jackson lives in the inner cities among  <br />various races, so she brings her experiences into this book to describe how the various races fit in with each other. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more books from this author.	2004-08-30

She talks about her struggles as a deaf person and her experience as Miss America, and how God has worked in her life.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed her book.  I like how she was so open about her struggles with a deaf person.  She didn't feel like she fit into the deaf world or the hearing world.  Yet, she continues to persevere, and with God's help, she overcomes her obstacles to become Miss America.  And she is open with her struggles as Miss America, too.  She talks about the need for privacy and her struggles with criticism from the press. <br /> <br />A great, inspirational book.	2004-08-30

As a sub-plot, we also see Olivia's teen daughter struggling with her dating life, her desire to be popular, and all the stuff that goes along with being a teen. <br /> <br />I thought this was a well written book on depression, from a Christian perspective.  It showed that anxiety is a component of depression, which many do not realize.  I liked that the book showed various reactions to depression from Olivia's friends, like the friend who trivialized it, saying that we all get the blues from time to time in life.  The book pointed out that that is one misconception about depression.  And we see that depression is not simply a problem of \\"not being close enough to God\\" but a real chemical imbalance in the brain. <br /> <br />I liked that the book showed of ways that some people overcome depression.  The medication issue was brought out, and even pointed out that medication isn't a sign of weakness, but an answer to prayer for some people.  They compared taking medication for depression, as a diabetic would take medication for diabetes.  The book also talked about some of the thought-changing techniques that also work, like the \\"relanguaging\\" technique, the STOP technique, setting aside time to worry, and taking your worries to God.   <br /> <br />I loved the character of Olivia.  You can really feel for her as she felt that God wasn't there, that she didn't deserve His love, that she felt she was a bad mom and wife, etc.  I do like that she tried to keep her faith during the rough times, and I liked how the story of Job was incorporated into the story.  I also enjoyed Olivia's humor.   <br /> <br />The other characters in the book were wonderful as well.  I loved Mike fighting for Emily towards the end.  And I loved Dr. Sullivan and seeing his struggles, as well as his wife Peg. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading other books in this series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-13

They talk about applying certain principles to areas of life such as divorce, addiction, weight, abuse, depression, and parenting.   <br /> <br />The 8 principles mentioned in this book for facing our problems were helpful, particularly choosing a travel companions wisely, leave your luggage behind, owning your problems, and beginning your journey with God.  Sometimes, I felt that they blamed certain problems that people have on \\"not trusting God enough\\" or \\"not being in a strong enough relationship with God\\".  That may be true to a certain extent.  However, sometimes we can have all the faith in the world, and yet, we can still struggle with weight, depression, etc. <br /> <br />But the authors didn't just stop at the \\"you must have faith in God\\" reasoning.  Making God a priority is important to overcoming difficulties.  But sometimes, putting your faith in action and doing certain things to help yourself is also very important. <br />	2004-08-13

In this book, teenage Becky ends up pregnant, and everybody persuades her to have an abortion.  Through the grief of losing her baby, Becky hooks up with Maggie, who helps her along the healing process. <br /> <br />This book gives all the brutal facts about abortion and the clinics.  You don't hear a lot of this stuff in the media.  Bambola talks about the devastating effects that abortion has on girls, such as the emotional trauma, inability to have children, sometimes even death.   <br /> <br />Bambola also deals with abortion from several perspectives.  She talks about the short term effects and the long term effects that girls suffer through after aborting their babies.  She talks about how abortion clinics are really run.  She talks about the abortion doctors and what some of them go through, and how they just shut themselves off to cope with the reality of what they are doing.  She even talks about the impact of what the abortion doctors do and how it effects their families. <br /> <br />This is a great overview of abortion in fiction form.  Atonement Child by Francine Rivers and Won By Love by Norma McCorvey are also good.	2004-08-03

After studying under Gracie, he becomes the Church in the Dell's minister. Jeb is really struggling to put food on his table. Jeb is also struggling with Angel and her rebelliousness, probably stemming from her mom being mentally ill and in a hospital. And Jeb is also struggling with being a &quot;delivery boy&quot; for Horace, since Jeb is unknowingly doing some dirty work for Horace and Ace Lumber. <br />  <br /> I thought the book portrayed the Great Depression well. Everybody was struggling so much and it appeared that some people really went off the deep end during that time. I thought Jeb was portrayed well. He is struggling with his conscience as he is making his deliveries for Horace. You can also see this as Jeb tries to decide whether to continue raising the Welby kids or if they would be better off with someone else. <br />  <br /> I look forward to the next book in this series. I hope we find out more of Angel and if she overcomes her rebelliousness, and what happens with Jeb and Fern. Also, I would be interested in finding out about the Welby's older sibling, Claudia. She was mentioned in book 1, but not in this book.	2004-07-28

This book was right on when he talks about how important it is for men and women to work on their <BR>marriages, not become workaholics so that we don't deprive our spouses and kids of ourselves.  I loved some of the humor in <BR>the book, like when someone suggested that he write a book on strong-willed wives (which I'm sure my husband would love), and <BR>he said that he wouldn't touch that one with a shovel.  It was also very clear that Dr. Dobson loved his father very much and <BR>was a major influence in his life.  I loved that stories about Dr. Dobson's dad's dog and Dr. Dobson coming to know the Lord <BR>towards the end of his life.<br />Many people accuse Dr. Dobson of being sexist and racist, but I don't see that at all in his book.  Dr. Dobson is a very big <BR>champion of marriage and keeping the family together.  We need more people like him, so that we don't have as many broken <BR>people in this society.	2004-07-16

I found this book helpful because I'm an adult child of divorce.  I could relate to a lot of what the book said.  There was some helpful information about having that sense of belonging, finding a home, finding peace, letting go of resentment, relating to your parents today, and how you can create that intact family by working with your own spouse.  This book was not a parent bashing book, but a book about forgiveness, realizing that your parents are human, and that although you can't change what happened in the past, you can find ways to make your life work so that you can move on from the past.	2004-07-16

Then there is her son Jordan, who prays for a new daddy and who wants her mother to believe in love again.  Then enters Casey, who is matched with Jordan through a Healing Hearts program.  Casey is struggling to overcome the death of his wife and baby.<br />This book was very short and to the point.  But in such a short book, Karen Kingsbury was able to fully develop the characters, so that we saw why Megan didn't believe in love.<br />I loved the characters in this book, especially Casey.  He is struggling with his grief, but he is able to help someone else out.  I also loved the &quot;Red Glove&quot; theme in the book, about red being the color of giving.  And I loved how Megan was eventually able to believe in love again.<br />I really enjoyed this short little book.  I haven't read Gidean's Gift, but plan to get a hold of that book, too.	2004-07-07

I liked how she used <BR>Scripture to back things up.  She even explained why it is so important to use Scripture when raising your children.  The <BR>positive reinforcers were really good and are things I'd like to try myself.  She also made a point that her way of parenting <BR>wasn't the only way, and that you have to decide what is best for your family when it comes to child discipline.<br />As for the 3 rating...I am a Christian parent who believes that we should not let our children get away with murder.  But I <BR>have some problems with some of the corrections she mentions.  Some were good, but I would not want to use some of what she <BR>suggested.  First, I've never liked the hot sauce/vinegar/soap treatment.  Second, she mentions spraying water into the face <BR>of a toddler who has a temper tantrum.  I'd feel like I was treating my child as a housepet if I did that.  Then she <BR>mentioned things like letting a child go without a meal for failing to do a chore.  I do believe strongly that you should <BR>never threaten to withhold food from a child, for any reason.  <br />Another example of something I wouldn't try is when the child refuses to hold your hand when going across the parking lot.  <BR>She mentions giving the child a choice:  either hold the child's hand or hold the child's hair.  If I was leading my child <BR>around the parking lot by the hair, I'd be afraid the someone would sick Child Protective Services on me.  <br />And finally, she mentions that if a child has a temper tantrum, make them go to their room and have them cry for 10 minutes.  <BR>First, what if the child is physically unable to do that?  Second, this one hits too close to home for me.  I had a <BR>babysitter who would hold me down by my wrists on my bed and make me scream because I supposedly screamed at her.  I ended up <BR>with bruises on my wrists.  Now, that WAS abusive.<br />I think with this book, I'd recommend using the corrections with much caution.  Use a discerning attitude towards this book.  <br />Take what helps and leave the rest.	2004-06-30

Then there is Gabe, a &quot;hobo&quot; who she nurses back to health.<br />I thought this was a very interesting book to read.  I loved the characters and how well developed they were.  I loved Aunt <BR>Batty and her love story with Walter.  She initially came across as eccentric, but ended up to be a very wise, loving woman.  <br />She helped Eliza to realize that her family, although flawed, loved her very much and urged her to forgive them and become <BR>close to God.  Gabe was such a wonderful, loving character, as well.  It was very easy to hate Frank Wyatt for the way he <BR>abused his family.  And I pitied Lydia, who seemed to be such a weak person, for not standing up to Frank when he was abusing <BR>the kids and for other things that happened in the book, which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the ending.  Lynn Austin <BR>also did a good job of not sugar coating the Great Depression.  <br />This was a great story of love, family, forgiveness, and reconciliation.

And then there is Irvel, the nursing home patient, who teaches Ashley so much about love.<br />As usual, Karen Kingsbury is such a great storyteller, writing such great life changing stories from a Christian perspective.  I loved the poem that Elizabeth wrote to Luke on his wedding day about &quot;lasts&quot;.  I cried when I read about Ashley's and Landon's good-bye on New Year's Eve.  It's obvious, through Karen's writing, how much these two really love each other.  And I loved how Irvel remembered her love to Hank when she has forgotten everything else.  Then there was Peter, and how real his struggles were, as far as the guilt over Hayley's accident and his drug addiction.<br />Karen has written another 5-star book.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.	2004-06-04

The author did a great job in presenting a mystery with so many questions to be answered.  What happened to Ellen?  Was she alive?  Who was the mysterious Garda and her daughter.  Why was Ellen so unhappy?  And mixed in with the main story was Teri, the PI who was trying to solve the mystery for Ellen's husband Carl.  She is struggling to fit in with the church, as well as struggling with the ghost of her husband, Jack's 1st wife.<br />The book not only presented a great mystery of betrayal and deception, but demonstrated the theme of grace and forgiveness.  The book showed that no matter how far you stray from God, forgiveness is always there, no matter how &quot;big&quot; the sin is.<br />I do think that some things were rushed towards the end.  What happened to Jimmy Jarvis?  There was some speculation, but nothing was really resolved.  Maybe that is just one of those things that will leave the readers guessing.  Also, what happened to Audrey towards the end?  <br />I would have liked to see the marriage between Teri and Jack explored more.  I know that Teri felt that she was competing with the ghost of Jack's first wife.  Maybe this will be explored in future books in the series. <br />Again, a great mystery book!  I look forward to reading Chat Room.	2004-05-28

I felt that this book did a good job in portraying what all a typical abused woman goes through.  The book mentioned &quot;Job's friends&quot;, so-called friends who told her that if she had more faith, prayed more, submitted more to her husband, etc, etc, then the abuse would go away.  Leslie's self-worth plummets as her husband picks on her about how she spends money, how she does her hair, giving her a &quot;failing report card&quot;, etc.  Leslie leaves her husband, but like a lot of abused women, she returns to him, because she misses him and thinks that if she could be a better wife, her husband wouldn't mistreat her.  There are many other things that happen in the book, but I don't want to ruin the book for you by saying what happens.  I do feel that this book is a must read for woman going through abusive situations.<br />I loved the character of Zoe, Leslie's mother.  We all need a mother like her, praying for us and helping us out of such <BR>difficult situations.  <br />The book, I felt, dealt well with the issue of whether a spouse needs to leave someone who is abusive and in what <BR>circumstances it is best to separate.  And the description of Charles was chilling!<br />The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 rating was because of cuss words that are in this book.  I always feel that <BR>profanity takes away from an otherwise good book, but this book is a Christian-based book, and I don't feel that the cuss <BR>words have a place in Christian-based fiction.  I know that the author was trying to get a point across, but it was difficult <BR>to read at the times because of the language, which fortunately, wasn't too frequent.<br />The book, overall, is a must read for women going through abusive situations.  It is clear that the author did her homework on this one.	2004-05-26

Connor and his wife, then struggle to put together their marriage, and has a very important decision to make.<br />Kingsbury is not afraid to deal with difficult issues.  In this case, she writes about Connor's one-night stand and about the <BR>son that results from that.  The feelings that Michelle felt upon finding out came out so good in this book--the anger and <BR>the hurt.  The book deals a lot with forgiveness.  Michelle ends up forgiving, but also, she puts a child's welfare ahead of <BR>her own hurt feelings and makes a big sacrifice for her husband, which I really admire her for.  And she falls in love with the boy, too.  And Kingsbury does a great <BR>job of promoting the idea that the marriage relationship is such a significant relationship.<br />I love Karen Kingsbury.  She is one of my favorite authors.  I hope to read more books by her.	2004-05-24

Joe comes into the <BR>picture as her handyman, to help get the store up and running.<br />There seems to be a little bit of everything in this book.  We find that Joe has a brother with Down's syndrome.  We seem him <BR>deal with that, and with the fact that his father left him.  We also find a little bit of mystery in this book, like who kept <BR>trying to sabotage Mona's bookstore, and who was really Reese Clark.<br />The book was very well written and easy to read.  The book didn't drag on and on about things.  I enjoyed the discussions <BR>between Joe and Ruth, who was the director of the group home where Gabe was staying.  And the forgiveness theme, between Joe <BR>and his father, was done well.<br />I guess I would have liked to see more of Mona's past expanded upon.  The book mentioned that her mother moved to Arizona <BR>after Mona's father's death.  What was the relationship between Mona and her mother?  I think that the parts about Mona's <BR>guilt over her father's death could have been expanded upon a little more.  <br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was very easy to read.	2004-05-24

This book is about a woman, Ruth, who is dying to pursue her dream of leaving her small town.  But she is bound by a radio <BR>station that is about to go under.  She is also confronted by her past in the form of her ex-boyfriend, Paul.<br />The book was a very well-written and enjoyable book.  I really liked the &quot;be content wherever you are&quot; theme.  I think that <BR>we can all learn something from that verse in the Bible.  The book also did a great job with the development of the <BR>characters, and explaining the past history with Ruth and Paul.<BR>And the stress that Ruthie felt in keeping her radio station afloat came out so good.<br />This is the first book by Henke that I have read.  I look forward to reading more of her books.	2004-05-24

During their relationship, they discover that they have a common tie to the past.  The book then shows the 2 struggling to overcome the difficulties from the past.<br />The book was a great romance book, but there was more to this book than just romance.  To some degree, there was a murder mystery at the nursing home.  There was also the lesson of forgiveness that Claire and Michael discovered as they revisited their past.  And there was Nana and her love and concern for Michael and Claire.<br />This is a book that I would highly recommend.	2004-05-11

This book tells of how Caleb has gone through all the different grieving stages, such as denial, anger, <BR>depression, sadness, and finally, acceptance.<br />It is very clear how much Caleb and Tiffany loved each other.  The author did a really good job getting this point across in <BR>this book.  The author also made it clear how much Caleb was suffering and struggling after Tiffany died.  I also liked the <BR>point that the author got across, on how we need to let God and others in and not shut people out when we are going through <BR>something so difficult.<br />I did think that some of the dialog was a little simplistic and not as thoroughly developed as in some books.  And not to <BR>quibble over typos, but in a conversation between Caleb and his brother Luke, Caleb mentioned that Luke was &quot;conceded&quot;.  I <BR>think the word that she wanted was &quot;conceited&quot;.<br />This is the first book I've read by this author.  I hope to read more by her.  There was a hint towards the end that maybe <BR>the relationship between Luke and Julie might be the basis for the next book.  We'll see.	2004-05-06

The book, Life Goes On, really portrays that humor.  It is always so fun to read about the eccentric characters from Harmony, Indiana and their adventures.  In this book, we read about Dale catching his car on fire, Dale's wife oversalting Dale's food, and the Sausage Queen getting impeached.  The book was balanced by serious moments, such as Dale's wife leaving him (and Sam cooking and doing Dale's laundry), about Sam questioning the Virgin Birth and the fallout from that, and Sam just wishing that his congregation would be more like Jesus among all the pettiness and nit-picking.  <br />This was a very fun book to read.  I can't wait to read more of Dale's books.	2004-04-30

This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.    I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a \\"guy\\" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.    The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.    About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.      Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.    And yes, I read \\"Lost Boy\\", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.    So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to \\"Gingerwoman\\", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other.	2004-04-30

This book details the friendship between 2 friends and their adventures in England and Finland.  This was a very interesting book, getting to read more about Finland and England, and about the people and their customs.<br />I enjoyed the humor throughout the book.  I liked reading about the customs officer teasing Penny about her name, Penny Lane.  I liked the contrast between the 2 characters:  the one free-spirited and assertive, and the other one, more serious and cautious.  Yet, the characters were able to come together and have a lasting friendship.<br />There were plenty of ups and downs withing the book, like Sharon losing her luggage, Penny worried that she was going to die because her mother died so young, and the discussion about Penny's past, and the cousin who was going through some worrisome times.  But there was a lot of fun, like the chocolate and the visit to a Finish sauna.<br />I highly recommend this book about a good, Christian friendship.	2004-04-30

I loved reading about the traditions of Hawaii throughout the book.  It was good reading about 2 Christians who are having some good, clean fun.  And I like the fact that they added the pregnancy to the storyline.<br />I did feel that the trip was a little &quot;too perfect&quot; and really, anticlimatic.  It would have been more interesting to have read a little more drama or a few things going wrong here and there, like in the first Sisterchicks book.<br />But overall, this was a very enjoyable book.	2004-04-30

I was very excited to discover that there was a 4th book in this series.  <br />This book has 3 subplots.  First, there is single mom Molly, whose ex-husband comes into town, saying that he's changed.  At the same time, she meets the town's new doctor and becomes attracted to him.  Then Tucker Tully's ex-con brother comes into town, trying to get his life back together, despite the townspeople who doubt him, including Tucker's wife.  Then Sophie's husband passes on and she must decide what to do with their apple orchird.<br />The title &quot;New Leaf&quot; adequately describes the book as we have several people trying to turn over a new leaf.  We have Molly's ex, who is trying to be a better father to their kids.  We have Carl (Tully's brother), who is trying to get his life back on track.  <br />It was also great to see some of the old characters in this book.  We even were treated to a scene of Lillian and how difficult she can be.<br />I look forward to seeing what comes next.  I found the Tully storyline especially interesting.  I'd be interested in seeing how Carl fares in the next book.	2004-03-25

The story was about a young couple with a son who end up going their separate ways after Daniel does not answer a very important question by young Lenore.  The book takes the reader through 15 years of their lives.<br />Lenore becomes a Christian as she struggles with life as a single mom to Scott.  She is blessed with a great job, great friends, and a great home.  Daniel, in contrast, is as far away from God as he gets.  He lives a lifestyle as a Hollywood actor, but gets wrapped up in alcohol, debt, and multiple divorces.  At the end of the book, Lenore and Daniel are in each other's lives again.<br />This book was so interesting to read.  I had a very hard time putting this book down.  The characters were interesting and easy to relate to.  You could really feel the emotions of the various characters.	2004-03-25

In this book, Valerie struggles to find her way back to her husband.<br />I thought this book gave a strong message on how important marriage is, and how we need to keep our eyes focused on God.  Through this fictional account, I thought this book gave some really good ideas as to how a woman should work towards her marriage.  This book also talks about how it is a bad idea for a woman to confide in another man.  The book was straightforward and easy to read.  The book had a happy ending in that Valerie and her husband reunited.	2004-03-01

At first, her mother's church tries exorcising the demons out.  When that didn't work, she is dragged to a horrible mental hospital where she is doped up.  She then escapes to the streets, until she is led to a kind woman (Faye) who takes her and her cat in.  She then finds help at the Golden House through Faye's nephew, Simon.<br />This book is very thoroughly researched, with different treatment approaches presented, from the tradition approach, used at Forest Hills, to a more progressive approach, used at the Golden House.  Carlson talks about all the different symptoms and things people with schizophrenia deals with.  I've visited some of the websites listed in the back of Carlson's book and have found that what she has in her book is in line with what is on the website.<br />Carlson also talks about the view that some churches hold on mental illnesses.  Some churches believe that mental illnesses are caused by sin problems.  Unfortunately, that point of view is not helpful to the person with the mental illness and that is brought out in this book. <br />I also liked how Carlson told the book from the first person perspective.  This gave the reader an idea of what all Alice was going through, her feelings, fears, and how she perceived the world.  All this gives an accurate description of what a schizophrenic goes through.<br />And I wish we had more treatment places such as the Golden House for people who are mentally ill.  Patients are treated with so much respect and dignity, as opposed to some of the traditional mental institutions where patients are treated more like animals than humans.	2004-02-13

Angel, the oldest of the 3 Welby kids, convinces Jeb and her siblings to play along with them, as they are desperate for food, shelter, and a sense of belonging.<br />I loved the humor in this book as Angel gives Jeb preaching lessons.  I also liked the message that no matter how far you are away from God, anybody can be forgiven and anyone can turn his life around, like Jeb.  And I liked how at the end, Jeb was willing to take full responsibility for his actions without offering excuses.<br />I was so excited to find out that this book is the first in a series.  I look forward to finding out what happens between Jeb and Fern, if Jeb makes it as a real minister, what becomes of the Welby children, if they will be reunited with their parents and their sister Claudia, what happened to the Welby mother, and where Claudia disappeared to.	2004-02-04

In the process, he finds God through the Catholic church.<br />This book is very honest about how he performed many abortions, including one on his own child.  It takes great courage for someone to stand up and admit he is wrong to commit such a terrible crime against humanity.  <br />This book gives a lot of background on his growing up years and medical training.  This book also details the abortion procedure and how it can be harmful to the women who have them.<br />However, this book was hard to read.  Clearly, this man is intelligent and well-educated, but I personally don't have his vocabulary.  I did not know what a lot of the words he used meant and had to guess at what he was talking about through the context in which he was talking about.<br />I also would have liked to have found out more about his son and his wives, and how being an abortion doctor affected them.<br />This is a good book for research on the abortion issue.  I would recommend that book for that purpose, but personally, I preferred &quot;Won by Love&quot; by Norma McCorvey and &quot;The Atonement Child&quot; by Francine Rivers.  Those books are much easier to read and get the point across just as good.	2004-02-04

In the book, his mother discovers that he has a cerebral allergy to milk.  He is taken off dairy products and seems to be cured of autism.  The book also talks about the author's marital problems caused by the strain of taking care of such a difficult child.<br />The author is very honest about her feeling towards her husband and over taking care of her son, plus the run ins with various professionals who just don't get it.  She describes her anger and frustrations very well and doesn't sugar coat anything.  I found myself getting very angry at her husband and other family members for blaming her for everything that was wrong with her son.<br />As a book reviewer for a family friendly site, I must say that there is profanity in the book that is always distracting.  If the language was cleaned up some, that might make the book better.  Plus, some scenes are kind of tough to read.  Some of her behaviors, although they weren't frequent, were abusive.  I know those incidents come out of frustrations from dealing with a difficult child, but maybe she could have pointed out that how she was dealing with the situation at times was not necessarily right and could have hurt her son.<br />All in all, this was a very interesting, informative book.  I was glad that she and her husband remarried towards the end.  The book does have a happy ending.  But not all stories like this have happy endings.	2004-01-21

She is quite devastated and doesn't know how to move on.  She decides to fulfill her husband's &quot;to-do&quot; list and then end her life.  But she meets so interesting people along her quest to fulfill her husband's to-do list, people who help her to find her faith in God and to make her realize that her life is worth living after all.<br />I love books by Lisa Samson.  Her sense of humor and unique voice comes through so good.  I love her flawed, yet lovable characters.  I love the names Pearly, Cheeta, and Peta.<br />The author did a really good job in showing how much pain Pearly was in when she lost her husband.  It was clear that she loved her husband very much.  <br />Pearly comes up with a unique way to commit suicide.  I won't go into the details as I don't want to spoil the book for you, but things are resolved beautifully at the end and Pearly decides that life is worth living and that she has so many people who love her.  I loved how all the things happened at the end of the book where Pearly's life is spared at the last minute and how God really makes things happen for a reason and that He really is in control<br />Lisa Samson has a subtle way of presenting God's truth without sounding preachy and without making you feel like she is shoving the Bible down your throat.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-01-15

It was also interesting to see how some of the characters resembled those in the &quot;Little House&quot; series.  But this book did not hold my interest and I had to quit reading it after the first 100 pages.  It seemed to dry and bland, not enough character development.  But this book was written in the 1930's and books written then may have taken a different approach than those written today.  Again, this might make a good little history book of the 1800's, but for me, it just wasn't too interesting.	2004-01-02

This book was about a teenage girl who struggles with feelings from her mother's death and helping out with her family, when both she and her father fall in love.  Then Jackie struggles with feelings of distrust for Katherine (her father's new love) and the long distance relationship with a rock star, Greg.<br />This book was very interesting to read.  Character development was great.  I liked how Collins brought in the past relationship between Celia, Danny, and Bobby, and how that still had an effect on everyone today.  I liked the theme &quot;Keep your eyes on God&quot;, like in the &quot;Color the Sidewalk&quot; book.  There was also some humor in the book, like with the fight between Clarissa and Alma Sue.  I was also amused at the idea of half the town traveling 4 hours to Lexington to get Katherine to come back to Bradleyville when she ran away.<br />I know that Jackie struggled with Celia and Celia's relationship with her father.  But I would have also liked to see some dialog developed between Celia and Jackie on that time period, especially since there was some resentfulness on Jackie's part toward Celia.  Also, I thought that the ending and getting Katherine to come back to Bradleyville happened a little quickly.  I would have liked to see how Katherine and Bobby ended up compromising on some of their issues.  Do Bobby and Katherine travel to Lexington from time to time, to account for Katherine's desire of big city life?  Do they agree to stay in Bradleyville and allow Katherine to work in Lex once a month?  Plus, I thought that at times, Bobby and Jackie seemed a little too judgmental, and that drove me nuts at times.<br />Again, I enjoyed this book as I did the whole series.  I did like the &quot;Color the Sidewalk&quot; book the best, but this was a very enjoyable book as well.	2004-01-02

The father then looks for his daughter and grandkids and they are all reunited.<br />I liked the humor in the book.  Being on the run from an abusive husband is serious business, but the humor did lighten up <BR>the husband.  I liked the bantering between Isabella and Wade (the preacher father), Wade passing out in the mall, the church <BR>catching on fire, Wade being roped into marrying a couple at the airport, etc.<br />I know that this book was meant to be a shorter novel.  However, it would have been nice for the book to be expanded another <BR>100 pages.  It would have been interesting to find out more about the abusive husband, Sydney's childhood, and the <BR>reconciliation between Sydney and her father.  Also, I thought that there was too much stuff at the beginning of the book <BR>about Wade trying to decide whether or not to find Sydney and Wade trying to get out of the church, but not enough towards <BR>the end of the book about Sydney's and Wade's reconciliation.<br />All in all, this was a pretty good book about grace and forgiveness.  Patricia Hickman is a wonderful writer.  I am looking forward to reading more of her books.	2003-12-23

Depression and the masks that people hide behind to hide their problems.  The book described <BR>how flawed the foster care system is in allowing abusive people be foster parents and how some kids are shuffled from home to <BR>home, as Amanda was.  The book also dealt sensitively with the subject of depression.  The book talked about how depression <BR>is not a weakness, but how depression can be caused by years of stress, as Maggie was under with her secret about her baby.  <BR>The book also mentioned that for some people, that medication can be an answer to prayer.  Maggie was thinking that good <BR>Christians didn't get depressed and was afraid of what people would think of her, yet, as she learned through her treatment <BR>program, that is not the case.	2003-12-23

It is written by someone who was been a foster parent and has seen the ins and outs first hand.  She is very straightforward and honest about the foster care system and does not sugar-coat anything.  She talks about the shortcomings of being a foster parent, such as the stigma attached to foster parents, the low pay, being on-call 24-7, kids getting sent back to abusive families, getting attached to a child, only to have to say goodbye, having to protect your family from the more dangerous foster kids, etc.<br />I really liked how she talked about the different foster kids and the descriptions of their backgrounds that brought them to foster care in the first place.<br />Some parts of the book were difficult to read because of some of the difficult and painful situations that some of the kids were in.  But I would highly recommend this book to someone who is considering being a foster parent.	2003-12-19

This book focused on returning to God, to the people you loved, kind of liked the prodigal son.  This book also talked about forgiveness and how sometimes, we do end up suffering the consequences of our actions.  But yet, no matter what we do, the book points out that God loves us and wants us to return to Him.	2003-12-10

Esmeralda was an elderly  character with a lot of spunk, who also went through some rough times with her husband when he came back from the war.  It was so easy to love her.  There was a lot of humor in this book--the church ladies following Horace to make sure the mule got a proper burial, Esmeralda giving dating advice to her friend, Beatrice, the church ladies all picking out a casket together, Maria's fake name.  But with the humor, I saw a lot of &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; stuff spread throughout the book in a very subtle manner--Esmeralda taking in Maria when she was so sick, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to go out of her way to be friendly to her obnoxious neighbors, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to make sure that Carl is a godly man, Esmeralda being so kind to Horace when he was so spiteful towards her in the beginning of the book.<br />You will love this book and the characters.	2003-12-10

Color the Sidewalk For Me is about a woman, Celia, who returns home after a 17 year absence to nurse her father back to health after having a stroke.  She struggles through her tumultous relationship with her mother and unresolved feelings for the love of her life, Danny.<br />This book was so good that I had a hard time putting it down.  The way the author wrote the romance and the love between Celia and Danny made me ache and root for this couple.  This couple clearly loved each other very much.<br />I liked how Collins used the past/present sections of the book.  Some authors lump the past in with the present in a chapter, and it becomes confusing to read.  But the way this author wrote about the past was excellent, giving us a good foundation of the problems between Celia and her mother, and what went wrong between Danny and Celia.<br />I loved how Collins brought in the characters from Book 1 of the Bradleyville series.  Jessie and Lee had gotten married, Mrs. B was portrayed as a nosy busybody, and she continued the &quot;feud&quot; between Jake and Thomas.  That feud added humor into a book with so many serious overtones.<br />The character development was wonderful.  The characters weren't goody-goody characters like in some Christian books, but are real people with flaws, hurts, etc.  From this book, I had a good idea of why Estelle was so coldhearted at times and why Celia led such a lonely existence.<br />And the Christian theme came out really good, about turning your eyes towards Jesus and not letting the past destroy you.  There was also the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation.<br />I can't wait until I read the next book in the Bradleyville series.  I know that the focus of the book will be on another group of characters, but I am hoping to find that Celia and Danny have worked things out and gotten married.	2003-11-24

This book shows how Mary Swan struggles with her loss, when her family maid suggests volunteering at a church, serving meals to the poor and homeless.  During that time, she meets two people who change her life: a black boy named Carl and a kind woman named Abigail, who leads her to Christ.  In the meantime, she is asked to solve a mystery for her school, where she learns more about her mother and about herself than what she has bargained for.<br />I loved the character development in this book.  The author did a great job describing the characters and what made them the way they are:  how Mary Swan's mother suffered from depression due to issues from her past, Carl's family background, and how Abigail came to serve at the church in the inner city.<br />This books was clearly well researched.  I traveled to Atlanta once for work, and it was so interesting hearing about the various sites in that city.  I loved the history of Coca-Cola.  It was also clear that race relations in the 60's in the south were well-researched and well-depicted, as well as the plane crash.  I also thought that the author did a great job with presenting mental illness, that depression is not something really terrible, but something that there is no shame getting help for.  <br />The author also described several lessons very well.  She described that black and white people can and should be friends with one another, and that the truth shall set you free.  I loved the Raven/Swan symbolism (ie. the black and white races, life and death, etc).  I really loved how Mary Swan's mother described church--as a place where one should be able to be him/herself and not have to paint a happy face all the time.<br />I did feel that some of the dialogue was a little lengthy.  There was some confusion over Mary Swan's gifts--was she a poet or an artist?  The book leads you to think initially that she was awriter, then midway, shows that she paints.  Also, it would have been interesting to see what happened to the characters.  Obviously, Mary Swan does have a daughter, but did she marry Robbie?  What happened to Carl, Miss Abigail, and her brother?  How far did Trixie and her dad get in their new relationship?<br />All in all, this was a great book and well worth your money.	2003-11-17

In this book, Robert gets laid off from his job unexpectantly and is encouraged by his wife to pursue his dream of writing.  Robert writes a book about his wife, Allyson's, last perfect day with her father.  The book is successful, but then, Robert gets too caught up in this success.  He almost loses his wife and daughter, but then, a mysterious stranger appears in his life and shows him what is really important.  <br />The book is relatively fast paced.  But despite the book's fast pace, Richard Paul Evans really delves into the characters and does a good job at explaining why they are as they are.  He especially goes into depth about Robert's background with his father and that strained relationship.  <br />This books was wonderful in making the reader understand what is important in life, and how Robert did what he could to make amends with the people that he loves, before he thought it might be too late.  And we all can learn to enjoy each day and those we love, as we never know if today will be our last day.<br />Congrats to this author for another great book!	2003-10-30

I feel that this book is very credible, since Dr. Sears is a pediatrician and has 8 kids.<br />There are a wide variety of topics in this book, such as sleep, nursing, nutrition, illnesses, discipline, the stages of development, etc.  The tips mentioned in this book make such perfect sense and work really well with my babies.  The book is very supportive of parents and emphasizes that the parent must do what is best for their children.  This book makes it clear that Sear's way is not the only way, but gives a good reference for taking care of kids and listing things that work best with kids.<br />He also explained really well how babies are made up, why they wake so often, why they eat so often, and how they are programmed to want to be with their mommies.  It gave me a good idea as to what makes my babies tick.<br />The book was very well organized and very easy to read.  I like Dr. Sear's kinder, gentler approach to raising children.  <br />I highly recommend this book for all new parents.  This is a wonderful reference book to check back if you have a question.	2003-10-30

This book details their friendship through various trial, such as the author's depression and Raina's son's cancer illness.<br />I loved the humor in this book.  Manning seems to write in a no-nonsense type of manner, which really matches with her personality.  I loved how she described how 2 women, so different, were able to build a friendship.  I loved how they were there for each other, especially when Raina's son became so ill with cancer.  I loved the funny stories in the books about the kids and their &quot;shopping trip&quot; for their mother, when they pick out some pretty questionable items for their mothers.<br />I would have preferred that the author have left out the cuss words.  It seems that whenever I read cussing in a book, it is kind of distracting.  Fortunately, there weren't too terribly many.  <br />Overall, this was a great book on friendship.	2003-10-20
US	51263439	R1UP4KX6TBDLRX	0842365826	108364203	And the Shofar Blew	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Good Read	This book is about a minister who takes a dying church and builds it up.  Unfortunately, Paul, the minister, gets overly ambitious and tries to follow in the footsteps of his father.  As a result, he goes about building the church up in the wrong way, by watering down the Bible and catering to the congregation and what they want to hear, instead of what they should be hearing.  He hurts many people along the way, such as Samuel, Stephen, his wife, his son, and his mother, until finally, everything comes crashing down around him.<br />Francine Rivers does an excellent job of describing what can happen to a church and its people if the person leading is not following God.  She goes into great detail describing the pain of Paul's family and friends as a result of his actions.  I like how she gives the background of Paul's father and how his father has strongly influenced Paul's actions.<br />There were a couple of flaws in this book, however, which is the reason I can't give the book 5 stars.<br />First, where did Eunice grow up: Pennsylvania or Kentucky?  I thought she mentioned that Eunice grew up in the hills of Kentucky, but then, later in the book, she mentioned that Eunice grew up in the hills of PA and that she even ran away there towards the end of the book.  I know that Samuel and Abby lived in Kentucky, so maybe she got the 2 confused.<br />Also, how did Paul's father die?  There wasn't a lot of explanation there, other than he died traveling to do something that he loved.  I think she mentioned an accident, but that didn't come out too clearly in the book.<br />Like some of the reviewers here, I would have liked to have seen the book expanded another 100 pages to describe the reconciliation process between Paul and Eunice, and all the people he hurt.  It seemed that it all happened too quick.  It would have been interesting to see Paul and Eunice in marriage counseling, where Eunices gets right down to all the rage she's feeling, and also, for Paul to examine his relationship with his father and how it influenced his decisions.<br />All in all, this book was well written.  I would highly recommend this, especially to all preachers, church leadership, and their families.	2003-10-10

Kingsbury went into great detail about what happened and how the country was affected by the World Trade Center Bombing.<br />She wrote about how lives were affected by the tragedy, through Laura and Jamie, and Eric.  Jamie loses her husband in the tragedy, but a look-alike of her husband ends up living with her.  He has amnesia.  Through him, who walks somewhat in her husband's shoes, she comes to know Christ.<br />The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that Jamie wasn't able to figure out that the man who wasn't living with her was not her husband.  That seemed a little unrealistic.  You are so much in love with someone and you know them intimately, so I would think that she could have figured it out a little sooner.  But the book explained that she was probably too close to the situation to see it objectively.  <br />All in all, this was a real page turner.  Karen Kingsbury most certainly did not fail to deliver, as always.	2003-09-04

In this books, she touches on several themes.  One, Charmaine, the main character, is struggling with her mother's abandonment and her desire to find a home.  Second, this book deals with mental illness, such as depression and schizophrenia.  <br />Lisa Samson is a Christian writer.  Yet, through her book, she expresses that it is OK to get help for mental illness, and that depression, etc. is not because you are weak or have a sin problem.  The church has a misunderstanding on what mental illness is about, but she disposes of the myths in her book.  <br />This book is one of the best I've read on the subject of depression (also, read Karen Kingsbury's &quot;When Joy Came to Stay&quot;.)<br />Lisa has a way of creating well-developed characters with depth and who are multidimensional.  Some Christian writers create &quot;goody-goody&quot; characters, but Lisa creates characters that are easy to relate to and who aren't perfect.  You couldn't help but love Mrs. Evans, Grandma Min, Grandma Sara, Ruth, and some of Charmaine's other friends.  And you can't help but hate people like Richard, Grace, and her parents.  And of course, you end up feeling sorry for Charmaine's mother.<br />Lisa writes with such depth, and is so easygoing in her books that I feel like I hearing my best friend talk to me.  She also sprinkles humor throughout the book.	2003-08-07

This really goes into depth about the after effects of the choices made by Daria in the first book, where, after she marries Cole, she finds out that Nate, her first husband is alive.<br />It discusses in great detail the identity confusion that Daria and Nate's daughter, Natalie, feels and how that effected her life. Natalie gets drunk and a car collides into her's and her best friend is killed.  Then the book describes very effectively the pain that she feels over her friend's death and how she works toward healing by turning towards God.  She then renews her relationship with her Daddy Nate and joins him in Timone.<br />I highly recommend this book on God's love, grace, and forgiveness.	2003-08-07

The book outlines in detail the causes of anger, like bad childhoods, housework, feeling like you have to be perfect, etc.  The book then gives practical suggestions for dealing with anger.<br />The author shares her experiences with the anger that she's felt towards her kids and how she overcame it.  The book is written from a Christian perspective, but is not at all preachy like some Christian self-help books.  She also adds humor throughout the book.	2003-08-07

This book seemed kind of dry, a bit forced.  I felt that it went into too much detail about his preparations, the actual sailing experience, etc.  This was great if you are interested in sailing, but I would have preferred to have him expand a little more about his relationships with the people he met along away, like he did in &quot;Walk Across America&quot;.<br />There were some things that he didn't go into detail enough on.  For instance, what all happened to his first marriage that resulted in the divorce and his depression?  I would have liked to hear more about his current family.  He talked about bringing his family on his trip, but there wasn't much mentioned about them.  There was little mentioned about his boys, nothing that I recall about his daughter from his first marriage.  He did talk a little about his dad, but when he mentioned that his dad came with him on the boat a 2nd time, he didn't expand at all on that experience.  And he didn't expand much on his experience with his wife and younger daughter being with him toward the beginning of the trip.  <br />He also mentioned coming to Christian faith in his &quot;Walk Across America book&quot;.  But again, that was barely mentioned in this book.  Did he lose that faith?  <br />It was interesting hearing about some of the people he met on his trip and about life in the southern US along the coast.  And this book may be of interest for someone really interested in sailing.  But it didn't quite hold my interest like &quot;Walk Across America&quot;.	2002-06-18

This book was about how one couple, Jade and Tanner, dealt with Jade's pregnancy and brain cancer, and about another couple, Hannah and Matt, who were trying to adopt a little girl.  This book was a sequel to 2 other books.  I liked how this book integrated the events from the other books into this book.<br />This was an emotion-packed book, with Tanner struggling over the possibility of losing his true love Jade, and with little Grace, who Matt and Hannah tried to adopt, but lost her.  I was moved to tears at their loss and at how Grace went through so much with her mother.  I was moved to tears when Hannah and Matt got to adopt Kody.<br />This was a fine Christian book that dealt with Biblical principals with getting preachy.  Kingsbury has a knack for doing that in her books.  This book discussed Jade's struggles with whether she committed adultery by remarrying after divorcing (and if God was punishing her by giving her brain cancer), and with anger &amp; bearing grudges, like with Hannah after her loss of Grace.  These issues were resolved in a very sensitive manner.  And then there was the struggle that Tanner had in why bad things happen to good people.  I think we can all relate to these struggles.<br />It is good to have characters who are Christians, yet, are flawed.  It makes it so much easier to relate to these characters, to know that God loves us, despite are problems and imperfections.<br />I look forward to reading more from Kingsbury.  I can't wait for her series with Gary Smalley.	2002-06-03

I could empathize with the people and situations in this book.  I've felt the anger and the need to retaliate.  I wish this book was out when I was in junior high/high school.  I'd give it to the school administrators, teachers, and those who harassed me.  This book pointed out and gave examples of how teachers, school administrators, and parents can help their kids get through this situation.

It was very interesting to find out the events in the various decades and how they affected people's lives.  I didn't realize that the Great Depression was so bad until I read this book.  <br />This book helped me to better understand why my grandparents, my parents, and why I and people my age are the way they are.  Events of our time really shape who we are.  My grandparents lived through the Great Depression and were concerned about money.  They were extremely patriotic as both of my grandfathers fought in WWII.  My parents grew up in the baby boomer generation, and I'm \\"Generation-X\\". I even understand why my husband and I have some differences (we're 8 yrs apart--he's a boomer, I'm a buster).<br />The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 star rating is because I felt that the authors were too hard on working mothers.  I remember reading that the X-ers were resentful from having parents who emotionally weren't there for them and gave working mothers as an example.  I'm a working mother for several reasons, and I'm emotionally there for my baby.  It was unfair for the authors to be so negative towards working mothers.  I know that the intent was to show how different events effect different people, yet, I felt that the authors were giving working mothers a guilt trip.<br />All in all, this is a great book.  It will help you to learn more about yourself and others.	2002-05-24

I like how Wick seems to write for the Lord, and the book is strongly Biblically based.  We need more fiction out there that is Christian.  There were a couple of points that prevented me from given this book a 5 star rating.<br />The characters were a little too good to be true and a little bit 1-dimensional.  Practically everybody was a Christian.  Lily was, at times, a little \\"too nice\\", and it about drove me nuts.  I was happy that Lily stood up to her father later in the book, and showed a little bit of spunk there.  I like to read about characters who have character flaws because these characters are a little easier to relate to and are more real.  Read the \\"Seasons\\" series by LaHaye and Blackstock to know what I'm talking about.<br />Second, I would have liked to have seen the reasons why Lily's father treated Lily the way he did, treating her like women were treated in Kashien.  It was mentioned that he treated her like he did after Lily's mother died, yet, it seemed that that aspect of Lily's and Owen's relationship wasn't explored as thoroughly as it could have been.<br />Also, Wick makes the mistake that many Christians make in assuming that anger is a sin.  Anger itself is not a sin.  It is what you do with the anger that is a sin (example: Owen treating Lily as he did, Bailey expecting everyone to do things her way before she changed).  This is backed up in Ephesians with the verse: Be angry but sin not.  And there is such a thing as righteous anger, being angry at sin.  Owen's way of treating Lily was sinful, and Lily had a right to be angry about that, but it seemed that the character was being punished for that anger.<br />Again, this was a good book overall, and I would recommend it.  I liked the evangelical approach, but I wished that the characters weren't so goody-goody.	2002-05-09

Birdie has had some troubling things in her past as well.  This book shows how 2 different people deal with the things from their past and how the 2 women are bonded together in this way.  The characters in this book are real and not too goody-goody.  There is not a lot of excessive preaching, but how we show Christ's love by our actions.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who has had troubled pasts, and just for anyone in general.  The book will be well worth your money.	2002-05-03

This book is a collection of true stories about marriages in trouble and how the couples overcame these problems.  There were various problems like abuse, alcoholism, illness, infidelity, and depression.  This book showed that despite the worst of problems, things will get better if we keep focused on God.  This books provides inspiration for my own marriage.  The commentary at the end of each story by Gary Smalley was very helpful, too, in analyzing what went wrong in each relationship and how the couple worked through their problems.	2002-04-18

There was Frank the 70 yr old secretary, who kept his congregation in line, but showed his softer side by caring for the Chinese twins.  There was level-headed Miriam and her husband, who adopted their niece from abusive parents.  There was Deena the lawyer, who opened her own coffee shop.  There was Dale, and his imaginative means of \\"evangelism\\", and Bob Miles, writing about everybody who walked by his office.  The story has its humorous side (like the trip to donate money the some people on an Indian reservation, taking a sidetrip to a ball game, where Sam and the other people who went with him were viewed on TV by everyone in town, sipping beer).  And there were the serious points, too.  This book is well worth the money spent.  I look forward to reading more from this author.	2002-04-16

A lot more serious than the first, but definitely with its lighter moments, like with the Scripture Egg project.  I'm sure that many people can relate to the characters in this book, who are so believable.  I can relate to Sam's struggles with his belief in God, as I'm sure that many have experienced the crisis of faith.  I was touched by Asa's and Jessie's generosity with the lottery money and how the town pulled together over Sally's illness.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.  And the author himself is such a nice guy.  I have friends who used to go to his church, and he responded quickly to an e-mail where I complimented him on his first Harmony book.	2002-04-03

As an adult, I loved her autobiographies.  This book not only described her college life, how she met her husband, and became a writer, but what life  was like during the Depression and WWII.  She described her battles with a  difficult mother without being overly resentful.  I am amazed at how well  she gets along with kids and how she can write so well for kids,  considering her own mother didn't really express her love for Beverly when  she was growing up. <br />From this book, I could also see little anecdotes in  her autobiography, which showed up in her books.  She described how when  she was a librarian and when kids applied for library cards, one kid  mentioned that her dad mowed the lawn when asked what he did.  I remember  reading this as Ramona's response in one of the Ramona books.<br />Is Beverly  Cleary still alive?  She must be up there in years.  At any rate, I loved  her autobiographies, and when I have children, I will not hesitate in  encouraging my kids to read her books.	2000-02-13

This book dealt a lot with hurts and anger over the past.  I am an abuse survivor.  This is the second book that has given me some stuff to think about in regards to my past.  The  first was Redeeming Love.  Rivers has several themes going in this book,  such as forgiveness, finding love and acceptance, abortion, euthanization  of the elderly, and the WWII concentration camps.  But the point that  Francine Rivers was trying to get across is the need to find our love,  acceptance, and healing in Jesus.<br />River's characters are always so  multifaceted.  They have their problems like everyone else, making it easy  to relate to them.  At first, I thought that Annie was too goodie-goodie,  but even she had her struggles toward the end of the book with fears of  being angry and bitter like her mother.  I was glad when Annie stood up to  her mother toward the end of the book and let her have it.<br />There were a  few loose ends in the book.  I would have liked to see Nora and Leota make  their amends before Leota died, but maybe Rivers wouldn't have been able to  get her message across if that was what happened.  I also would have liked  to see the medical tech get what was coming to him for euthanizing Leota  and the terminally ill. I would have liked the family find out what caused  Leota to die at the end.  Any chance of a sequel?	1999-12-20

But there are a lot of unanswered questions in this book.  Why did David's mother abuse him and  not the other kids?  How did his mother turn from a loving mother in  Chapter 1 to someone so evil in the following chapters?  Was it the  alcohol, mental illness or both?  Why didn't the school authorities pick on  his behavior sooner, like when he was stealing food and coming to school in  rags?  Were the other kids also removed from the home?  Why weren't charges  pressed against the parents?  And how could it be that David's father was  too drunk and weak to stop the abuse, yet, he was still able to work as a  firefighter?  Maybe I am missing something or maybe these questions are  answered in the sequels.	1999-12-19

I love how Marie describes her struggles with mental illness and how she finds the strength within herself to overcome her problems.  She does this without blaming or resenting the people in her life who mistreated her,  like her parents and the people in the hospital.  She gives hope for the  hopeless.	1999-11-07
