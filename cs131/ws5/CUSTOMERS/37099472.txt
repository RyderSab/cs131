This loss camouflages you with all of your competitors.  <br />At some point, you might even tell yourself, \\"Everyone else is doing this with his or her marketing, and so it must work...\\" \\"Your Marketing Sucks\\" will knock you out of this but-everyone-else-is-doing-it mindset. <br /> <br />Number two: At some other point, you may think you can spend a lot of money and get customers, i.e. buy your customers. This is risky and super expensive. I know of no advertising or marketing firm that gives refunds for a poor or non-existent marketing ROI. (Unless of course you negotiate your contract this way). You must be involved in crafting and executing your marketing message, \\"Your Marketing Sucks\\" reminds the reader of this.  <br /> <br />In sum, before you spend a ton on marketing, at least look at \\"Your Marketing Sucks\\" to rule out the chance that you about to waste your money, or unprofitably misrepresent your company.	2005-10-03

Read this book months before you even think about saying \\"I do\\".

So, if you hope that the wedding will make everything better, it won't. Fix you, then get married J. <br /> <br />Throughout this book, married women reveal the little truths about marriage that they had to learn the hard way. It's as if you're in a little room and all of your girlfriends are telling you what you need to know before you get married, all the dirty details and not so dirty details. Even though the title may seem as if it the information is all negative, it's not. Marriage can, and should be a wonderful thing.

Fryxell busts through many of the concepts that lock many would be writers into procrastination. For instance, I'm one that normally awaits my \\"muse\\" before setting to write. Fryxell makes it clear that waiting for such so-called \\"inspiration\\" to arrive is a hoax and drives you to create writing that may not be true to your writing genius.  <br /> <br />Another folly that Fryxell brings to bear is the idea that creating an outline before writing is outmoded or even a time waster. Not so according to Fryxell. Outlines keep you on track and keep your writing focused.  <br /> <br />Here's my favorite writing myth that Fryxell tears to shreds- write your first draft as if it is your final draft. If you are like me, while writing a first draft you know that it's just the first draft so you can get lazy with minor details and leave spaces while comforting yourself with, \\"I'll be back to it later\\". Of course your fist draft is not your last draft but the time saving idea is to write as if it's your last draft so that you won't get lazy.  <br /> <br />The only area where I'd critique Fryxell on is his advise on research. Research, while critical, proves times consuming.  Fryxell suggests going to the library, reading books, and contacting experts to expedite research. I don't find this advice sufficient. Thus, I propose turning to other books (like \\"Find it Fast\\" works), asking your librarian for research resources (this assistance alone should blow you away because libraries are stocked with primary information sources) and using academic databases to expedite the research aspect of your writing.  <br /> <br />So if you're ready for lightening fast writing, certainly take on the advice of Fryxell.   <br />	2005-07-12

Gladwell is a writer and reporter by trade. As such, he needs to bring things, that may otherwise get overlooked, to general public's attention. Moreover, Gladwell has to work through psychological studies that left to themselves serve as insomnia cures, but once translated into useful knowledge, have the potential to alter how people act and think. <br /> <br />\\"Blink\\" is such a translation that makes the reader question,  \\"How do I \\"know\\" what I \\"know\\"?\\"  We have, according to some numbers, over 50,000 thoughts a day. And if you are not careful about what you are thinking, in a blink, you can have 48, 500 of the same exact thoughts the next day. If you hear and see something often enough, you come to believe it. So if we follow this reasoning, if we don't filter our thoughts we'll begin to believe that same material we re-play in our head each day (regardless of whether it is true or false). This locks us in a life of mediocrity. Gladwell proposes to crack the monotony by asking a question about the very foundations of our belief and \\"knowing\\" systems. <br /> <br />Granted Maxwell's treatment and examples such as how an art expert can spot a fake sculpture in a second, and how day traders can overpower five-star generals in a two day war may seem cursory. Should he have delved deeper, Gladwell would have risked boring the readers and never attained the overarching goal of getting the masses to re-think their split-second thinking processes, judgments and decisions. <br /> <br />	2005-06-28

Books	5	4	8	N	N	I'd reconsider a what's an asset	When I discuss Robert T. Kiyosaki's methods with friends, the most controversial, if not emotional, point to arise is whether or not a home is an asset or liability. Presently, in today's market, a home is a liability. Why? In San Diego alone, %48 of the mortgages are interest only loans. This is essentially gambling with the home market and trusting that home values will increase in the same percentage points as they have in the past. Apparently no one is listening to Mr. Greenspan or Mr. Kiyosaki. <br /> <br />When I mention the house is a liability to people and jokingly say I'm gonna wait until I have five million dollars to spare to buy a house with cash, people bulk and recite numbers like, \\"but 90% of the millionaires gained their wealth through real estate\\". Well, the point is many people are counted as millionaires based on the value of properties they don't even own free and clear.  <br /> <br />This home-as-a-liability method certainly is not popular today since easy \\"wealth through real estate\\" has come to appeal to millions of people. Common sense states, if everyone's doing it, i.e. buying and selling homes in hopes of getting rich, isn't the market going to get diluted and values are going to go down? To this question, a San Diego mortgage broker responded, \\"You can't use common sense when it comes to real estate prices, you'll miss out.\\"   <br /> <br />Mr. Kiyosaki's point is don't do what everyone else is doing and think you'll get wealthy. When you think about it, \\"Buy a home now and you'll have lots of value later,\\" sounds a lot like, \\"Go to college for four years and you'll find a great paying job after you graduate.\\"  I'm glad that I read \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", it gave perspective when I thought I already had it. <br />	2005-06-28

Turns out, Stephen Pollan's \\"Live Rich\\" is not about fast money but financial and emotional intelligence.  <br /> <br />The richness of \\"Live Rich\\" truly comes across in part one where Pollan explains how we are not living in the financially stable past, but a turbulent present that demands that we can re-create ourselves, and re-market ourselves for the chameleon economy in which we live.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Pollan's most novel advice is not just to take a promotion for the sake of money, but to take the job opportunity that requires you to learn a new skill set, even if it means less pay. This counsel goes against the idea that we are living in a highly specialized world and the more deep and narrow your skill set, the more appealing and valuable your skill set.  <br /> <br />But as Pollan writes, you can't rely on an employer, a job consultant or even \\"Live Rich\\" to tell you how to prepare yourself to lead a financially rewarding career. You must educate and create yourself as Pollan explains.  <br /> <br />However, part two of \\"Live Rich\\" contained chapters too short and too broad to prove productive for rich living. I imagine chapters such as \\"Advertising\\" and \\"Job Interviews\\" are included only to encourage the reader to seek out other books or experts to educate them in particular areas that can directly impact their financial success.  <br />	2005-06-28

So, I need to \\"R\\"elease this needless attachment and start investing in my intentions.  <br /> <br />Britten has experienced many of the troubles that women can find themselves in, from dating fleeting men to living a life that leaves them sobbing alone in bed at night. Not only does Britten talk about how we can short change ourselves, but points out some of the tell-tell sights that we should look for and address before they worsen, like oversleeping and withdrawing from life. Alas, the book helps bring a turbulent life into balance, and the book is not only for women. I've definitely added \\"Fearless Living\\" to books I re-read when I feel my life isn't going the way I want it to go, and to get up enough courage to do something risky.

Early on, Getty asserts that being \\"rich\\" is not a number, but truly a state of mind.  In his view, there is no magic potion, mantra or affirmation that will garner you more goodies. If you want money, get out and work for it. If you want to be rich you must work for yourself. And once you hire people, even though you bear all responsibility for what happens, encourage your competent employees to think and act as if they are running their own company.  <br /> <br />Getty got rich because he understood the fundamentals of economics, thanks to his parents. Getty reasoned that the whole point of economic growth is to enhance your own life, as well as the lives of those around you. <br /> <br />Wealth and wealth seeking is made to seem loathsome in some altruistic circles. Yet, within the pages of \\"How To Be Rich\\", you find a man who consistently laid his ego aside and sweated alongside oil-workers. As his standard of living rose, so did that standard of living of numerous other people around him. <br /> <br />It may appear as if Getty encourages trickle-down economics. Getty worked fast and hard so as to turn any trickle into a gushing spring. If things didn't go his way, Getty maintained a \\"calm\\", and thus more productive demeanor, and found solutions. He admits to his screw-ups and delineates characteristics that promote success. In short, Getty delivers a worthwhile read for any aspiring person.  <br />	2005-05-09

Having read hundreds of self-help books, I must concede that Waitley has sound reason for making this claim. Several self-help authors have quoted or used many of Waitley's first-hand accounts of how to achieve greatness.<br /><br />For example, Waitley actually spoke with the man who interviewed billionaire Mr. Hunt, and Waitley met a woman born with polio who went on to win Olympic gold. Moreover, Waitley listened to cassettes of oft-quoted coach Vince Lombardi, who reportedly said \\"winning's not everything, it's the only thing\\".

If you procrastinate, read this book. If you know that you are not living to your fullest potential, read-this-book.  <br /> <br />I picked up \\"Peak Performance Selling\\" because it contained the catch phrase, \\"Peak Performance\\". Like most ambitious people, I want to make the most of my life and time. Too often, we are our own worst enemies because we allow ourselves, unknowingly or not, to get off course. Then again, we fail to address the little human tendencies, that, when left unchecked, lead to mediocre living.  <br /> <br />For Kerry Johnson, the biggest monster standing between you and \\"peak performance\\" is meddling FEAR, or False Education Appearing Real. This fear stops you from making the phone call, asking for the sale, following-up and doing whatever else you need do to succeed.  <br /> <br />Johnson shows you how to implement a short-term and long-term reward system so that you are more motivated to stay on track with your goals, and never succumb to paralyzing FEAR. I'm sure there's a predictable laundry list of things that you must, or should, do everyday to cement your road to success. But you HATE, to do these things with a passion so great, that you can put them off, until you're struggling through life and have no choice but to do these dreaded tasks. <br /> <br />If that's your problem, here's Johnson's promise to you:  <br />\\"If you can focus on what you want and not get caught up in details, if you can think about your goals and not think about the difficulty in achieving them, you'll meet with success you've never experienced before, without feeling a great deal of pain in the effort.\\"  <br /> <br />Using Johnson's method, you can attain a sales increase of 70% in six weeks. Johnson tracts your current selling output, and matches it against your goal range and shows you exactly what you need to do everyday to achieve your objectives. Johnson's approach is not a quick fix. He is sensitive the human's natural loath for change, and tailors his program subtly but surely to guide the would-be achiever to definite success.  <br /> <br />In brief anyone desiring to get more out of life should get this book. I'm surprised it's still not in print. <br />	2005-04-18

In terms of context, William's spotlights many of the career-doubts and self-doubts that women in all stages of their career struggle with, such as childbearing and quitting a hated job.  <br /> <br />Reading \\"Wildly Sophisticated\\" was like sitting in on a conversation with women eager to enhance their careers, yet confused by conflicting feelings of undeserving success, short-selling themselves, and questioning whether they are doing enough or too much. <br /> <br />William's layout includes inspiring quotes from actresses and \\"great thinkers\\" that help reinforce the message of her book- you are responsible for your career success. The \\"strategy\\" area adds practicality as she gives her readers immediate steps for fortifying their career path. With the \\"Career Confessions\\" section, Williams reminds every woman that she is not alone in her journey to at-once have everything she desires, most specifically a fulfilling career.  <br /> <br />If you are baffled with your career path or need to talk over your career plans, but no one is listening, pick up \\"Wildly Sophisticated\\". William's honest anecdotes easers the lonesome yoke of feeling like a career looser, while inviting women to a world where risk, embarrassment and failure are essential for success. William's tested advice speaks openly to the needs of ambitious career women.  <br />	2005-04-18

What I found was a book that featured charts summarizing past studies on the benefits of Transcendental Meditation. I did not find out how to promote better health, unfold my creative potential nor create peace in the world having read this book.  <br /> <br />To actually learn TM, according to Robert Roth, you need to traverse 8 steps which involve attending seminars and listening to tapes.  <br /> <br />This book is helpful to those who'd like to conduct research on the effectiveness of TM simply because the references used in the book refer to several clinical studies on TM.  <br /> <br />If you want a practical \\"How To\\" guide on meditation check out Kathleen McDonald's \\"How to Meditate: A Practical Guide\\".  <br />	2005-03-30

Rewrite Right functions better as a grammatical reference book than as a guide for how to edit an article or book. This is because her discussion of style, punctuation and mechanical style all inherently involve understanding grammar.  <br /> <br />Vernolia's approach is to writing is technical, not theoretical. So, if your thinking and writing is nebulous, and you need help refining your ideas into a coherent message, Rewrite Right is not the book for you. However, if you are pleased with the orderliness of your work, Rewrite Right will assuredly help you isolate grammatical errors and inconsistencies in your writing style. Venolia also points out the grammatical subtleties that separates amateur scribblers from professional writers. <br /> <br />Rewrite Right is more functional than other grammar books I've purchased because it is small, 6 X 7, and contains just 189 well-used pages. Her use of images and short sentences from famous authors, particularly Mark Twain, also make this a fun read and quick learning tool. Her Index saves time.  <br />	2005-03-30

Regardless of cataloging, the reader will come away from \\"Tipping Point\\" either mused by the underlying nuances of how diseases spread, crimes rates plummet and how specific conditions can convert everyday human behaviors into societal anomalies. Or, the reader will re-examine how to create a marketing mania. <br /> <br />Citing cases histories from Sesame Street, Hush Puppies, Blues Clues, Airwalk, and \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\", Gladwell presents marketing success as a \\"hip\\" or \\"cool\\" idea that spreads from person to community and over again. For Hush Puppies, it was a few kids wearing their shoes that led to stellar increases in sales revenues. Building upon child TV research and the things the directors hated about Sesame Street, Blues Clues poised itself as one of the most successful children's TV programs in history. Airwalk garnered increased sales after pitching itself to a niche community of skaters, and later lost this consumer loyalty after neglecting to treat skaters as a group of people with unique consumer demands. \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" started leaving bookshelves in droves once women's groups identified with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood message and convinced three generations of women to purchase the book.  <br /> <br />Though it is not shouted in \\"Tipping Point\\", the message behind these marketing sensations could be attributed to making a group that once felt ignored or indifferent (or who was not aware of these conditions) suddenly feel valued, understood and unique.   <br /> <br />Clearly, I read \\"Tipping Points\\" for its' marketing insights, and found myself pleased with the contents.Persons aiming to reach niche markets and individuals aspiring to improve upon old ideas may benefit from the examples presented in \\"Tipping Point\\". Finally, as afore mentioned, Gladwell's writing style makes for an absolute page-turner.  <br />	2005-03-19

I've had Flip Dictionary for just a month and it is already more ragged than my Roget from usage. A thesaurus like Roget's is great for nouns and adjectives, but Flip Dictionary covers every noun, verb and preposition that thesauruses typically overlook.  <br /> <br />I bought Flip Dictionary, FD, to keep my writing fresh and unpredictable and that's precisely what it does. Maybe you're like myself and have exhausted the usefulness of your word processor's thesaurus, get the Flip Dictionary. Honestly, I flip through this book just for fun. <br /> <br />Here's a big bonus: Flip Dictionary saves horrid spellers like myself. For example, you may know what a word means and how it sounds, but you can't spell it, and spell check is no help either. Here's how Flip Dictionary solves this problem. Say I wanted to use the word that sounds like \\"crawlch\\", which means to bend over, and I have no idea how to properly spell \\"crawlch\\". But I've heard this word used several times and I know it's a real word. <br /> <br />I just flip to \\"bend\\" in the Flip Dictionary, and wouldn't you know it, the reference for bend refers to \\"crouch\\" the real way to spell \\"crawlch\\". That saved me a lot of time and I'll use FD for the same problems in the future. <br /> <br />Mark Twain tells us the there's a colossal difference between the right word and a word that just fits. Perhaps Mr. Twain did not use a Flip Dictionary but I imagined if he were around today, he'd write, \\"Buy it\\".   <br />	2005-03-14

Starting a business, for me, is riddled with fears of self-doubt touched by moments of feeling, \\"Hey, maybe I'm doing something right here\\".   <br /> <br />I found Seth Godin's Purple Cow a comfort as a small business owner. Sometimes in the mist of listening to business advisers, accountants and loan officers you can forget why you even started. This forgetfulness puts distance between you and the beloved customer. <br /> <br />Godin's Purple Cow is purple not only because it is different, but because it has a heart. The examples of companies mentioned in this book succeed because they stopped looking at \\"the numbers\\" for a moment and started asking deep questions about their customers such as: What do our customers need; who really is our customer, not who we think he or she is, but really who are they and why should they bother with us in the first place?  <br /> <br />While Godin's principles may not fly in Blue Chip corporations, I aim to build a substantial corporation nevertheless. So reading that you don't have to spend a ton of money on marketing is comforting. This marketing decision, by the way, is a personal one. Intimately knowing your customers, and potential customers for that matter, will tell you how to reach them. Otherwise, you will do textbook market testing to try to figure out what works. <br /> <br /> I've come to find word-of-mouth works best for me. Granted it's slow, it's what my customers and I are comfortable with and want. Reading that I should stay true to my passions and take the time to create something remarkable, not just marketable, inspires my creative energy and helps me remain calm and confident about my business outlook.  <br /> <br />In brief, I recommend this book to young entrepreneurs with radical ideas and a sizzling passion for what they do. Additionally, I'd recommend Purple Cow to anyone who feels they are disconnecting with their clients.  <br />	2005-03-14

Williams gives you the tools you need to dissect those professional marketing materials so that you can go and create your own outstanding package.  <br /> <br />In four simple steps, she explains how to use the elements of design: proximity, alignment, repetition and contrast. Read this book and you will never look at marketing materials the same, ever. Before, I just did \\"what looked pretty\\" on paper.

She speaks to the aspiring writer who may have forgotten some grammar rules while queuing you to times when you may not need to adhere to all the rules in the grammar book. <br /> <br />Her writing is witty and makes grammar fun, for once.

Yet, you don't want your reader to get lost. Royal helps you stay true to your writing agenda while keeping your reader enticed. <br /> <br />As far as grammar goes, Royal serves it up in short easy to remember bullets.

Years ago, you'd have to twist someone's arm to convince them that diet plays a huge role in clear skin. Though the diet/acne subject remains heated even among dermatologists I am relieved that Dr. Perricone sets forth the connection between diet and clear skin.  <br /> <br />Nutrition is a complex and personal subject. Dr. Perricone takes on a monumental task in helping people achieve clear skin through diet. The inclusion of Dr. Perricone's anti-inflammatory diet is admirable because one of the thousands of possible causes of acne includes dietary irritation.  <br /> <br />A diet that causes inflammation weakens the immune system. Once the immune system is weaken, the skin is more sensitive to irritants both internal (antibodies resulting from food allergies) and external (toxins in the air and arriving from surface contact).  <br /> <br />Along with the anti-inflammatory diet, Dr. Perricone educates the reader about the importance of vitamins and minerals to relieving acne. Once you know how a diet impacts your visage, you are more likely to abide by a beautifying diet, regardless of its daunting appearance. <br /> <br />It may seem cumbersome to alter you diet as Dr. Perricone suggests. But I have spoken with individuals who have used portions of Dr. Perricone's advice with pleasing results.  <br /> <br />In terms of context, The Clean Skin Prescription is almost identical to the Acne Prescription. I would recommend this book to all skin care professionals largely because I have entered spas where the estheticians did not think diet had anything to do with acne. Additionally, if you are suffering with acne, Dr. Perricone's book is an empowering and practical guide for attaining clear skin. Lastly, I suggest Dr. Perricone's material to the individual who questions the link between a balanced diet and beautifully radiant skin. <br />	2004-12-30

The book was used and someone made comments throughout the book in the margins. The comments enlivened the book a bit. The previous reader essentially called Wilde a whiner and a liar as the author presented her view of women as resentful, man-made beauty queens.  <br /> <br />After thinking about Beauty Myth over a series of months, I find this book does overly victimize women. Women are not stupid. We buy the magazines, watch the news, watch commercials and watch the shows that continue to idolize the thin female. Women have money and money dictates what is acceptable.  <br /> <br />No one is forcing women to look skinny. We're kidding ourselves. If we really wanted to start a revolution and dispel the Beauty Myth we'd stop watching soap operas, stop watching shows were the starlet is 10 pounds underweight, we'd stop buying magazines that tell us how to loose twenty pounds in 2 weeks and we'd stop making dewy eyes over merchandise that is sold by supermodels. Are we doing this? No.  <br /> <br />We are telling the advertisers that want and need to make money that they don't need to change what they are doing, because we (educated women with money) are still buying.  <br /> <br />This whole thing is not about Beauty anyway. It's truly about feeling loved. This is an ancient and eternal issue. It will not find resolve in books, but in the lone heart of a woman as she does battle and makes due with her self-esteem. <br />	2004-12-28

From taking drugs that destroyed their babies to taking cancer provoking concoctions, women have served as uninformed guinea pigs for years.  <br /> <br />Accordingly, Seaman gives women a reason to say \\"No\\" to new drugs and new therapies that promise to make our lives easier in the ever popular crusade to ease \\"woman problems\\".  <br /> <br />The female physique is inundated with mystique. That which is not understood faces constant scrutiny and treacherous attacks. Seaman sends a message loud and clear to all women- Take control of your own health because there are thousands of people out willing and waiting to experiment with your well-being while hailing promises of new found youth and renewed vigor. <br /> <br />I suggest your cross read The Greatest Experiment Ever Performed on Women with Uzzi Reiss' Natural Hormone Balance for Women. Reiss claims that estrogens have a \\"bad\\" rap because studies such as those covered by Seaman only address synthetic hormones or those derived from horses. I did not find Reiss' arguments compelling, it just offered another view of the women's hormone scene. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

That's fine. However, Holford's poor treatment of the protein controversy needs deeper examination and placed me on guard as I read \\"Optimal Nutrition Bible\\". For example, his deduction regarding how much protein a person needs is scantily, if hardly justified.  <br /> <br />The author quotes a US Olympic trainer that says a person can gain 8 pounds maximum of muscle in a year (even that number is controversial, by the way). OK that's fine. So, Holford deduces that a person can only gain 0.3 ounces of muscle a day. He adds muscle is only 22% protein. Fine. So how does Holford conclude that one only needs an extra quarter of a teaspoon a day of protein (above the RDA, this is not clear in the section) to obtain maximum muscle growth? Protein is not only utilized by the muscles- it's used all over the body. Even some bacteria are comprised of protein.  <br /> <br />Several factors influence the digestion of protein. As a nutritional author, Holford should have addressed the possible loss or conversion of protein into fat or a carbohydrate. This all depends on when you eat the protein and what you consume along with the protein. He trivializes muscle building when it is actually quite a complex subject.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, I found Holford's work to be worthy of a Nutrition library because it briefly and clearly covers several concerns related to nutrition. Just crack open the Table of Contents, and you can read his book in bits and pieces as needed. <br /> <br />Holford's vitamin and mineral lists, which include symptoms of nutritional shortages, allows the reader to create a nutritional program suitable to her own needs. In the spirit of Noixia, this book offered me a chance to discover something about myself that I did not know. I'm sure you'll likewise have nutritional epiphanies while reading. Just make sure you do your own health research as well. <br />	2004-12-28

Advanced exercisers.  <br /> <br />The book tells you exactly what muscles to work, how to work them and how many reps you should do. The book is so decriptive that I could actually function as a \\"Bodysculpting for Dummies Book\\" with all due respect. The images provided also the familiarize you with proper form. (But let me interject that nothing compares to having a competent trainer show you one-on-one how to do properly lift a weight.) <br /> <br />I used the program designed for the Advanced user for six weeks and acheived the results I desired.  <br /> <br />As a figure competitor, let me assure you that there is more to sculpting your body than just doing workouts. Yes, working out properly and consistently is crucial to muscle development. But this is only 10% of the game. The other 90% is ensuring that you eat well enough so that you 1.have the energy to lift the weights and get through the workout and 2. have enough protein to ensure that your muslces recover and grow. Moreover, you must sustain the mental control that motivates you to consistently eat well and rest. <br /> <br />I don't feel this \\"difficult, self-discipline\\" part of training is properly covered in exercise books. It's probably because discipline is a hard sale. I have read muscle mags and exercise books for years and was mislead about how critical nutrition was to altering the appearance of the body.  <br /> <br />There are lots of books at there that go through the motions of a \\"good\\" workout for muscle development. The \\"Bodysculpting Bible for Women\\" expertly takes you through the motions. For this I give it a rating of 4.9 stars. But please heed my advise that if you want to change your body, you have to change you other habits as well, starting with your mindset and nutritional habits.  <br /> <br />I wish you the best.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-05
