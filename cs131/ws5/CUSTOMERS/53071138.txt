I took this book with me on an ER visit, and the wait to see the doc lasted longer than it took to read this quick read. <br /> <br />There are some plot twists and plot devices that are nicely done.  But the characters are essentially unlikable, and there are too many unrealistic, improbable and/or deus ex machina events to make this overly-quick read a good book.	2005-10-13

Avlon makes some good points, and his book is worth reading, particularly for its insights on what went wrong in the Carter administration.    On the other hand, Avlon sometimes stretches the evidence to make a point, so that he even winds up contradicting himself.    Writing about Nixon as a typical moderate, Avlon says that Nixon rejected the Republican appeal to racist southern votes, and that Nixon strove to reassure voters he \\"was no Wallace.\\"  Nixon was \\"ultimately successful\\" in desegregating southern schools, and is finally quoted as writing that \\"Republicans must not go prospecting for the fool's gold of racist votes.\\"      But when later writing about African-American Senator Edward Brooke's role as a moderate, Avlon claims that Brooke was constantly fighting the Nixon administration's \\"southern strategy,\\" now claiming that Nixon himself was appropriating \\"George Wallace's blue-collar southern segregationist support.\\"  To signal his support of the South, Nixon here is said to have nominated to the Supreme Court Haynsworth, who had questionable commitment to civil rights, and then nominated Carswell, who was \\"spectacularly unqualified,\\" though Southern, and believed in segregation.  The Nixon administration had an \\"intentionally slow timetable for desegregation.\\"  Here, BROOKE, not Nixon, is quoted as calling the search for southern racist votes \\"fool's gold.\\"    The book is worth reading, but beware the stretched facts.    The binding in the book I bought was cheaply made.	2005-07-25

Someone's trying to kill someone in Hogwarts;  half-way through the book, it's telegraphed that Draco is trying to kill Dumbledore.  Dumbledore is investigating the past of Voldemort.  That's it, folks. <br /> <br />There is a bit of the glimmer of the old excitement, such as when Harry slips a luck potion to a friend, Harry tries to find out how Draco is disappearing from Hogwarts, figuring out if Snape is really on the good side, the mystery of who the \\"half-blood prince\\" is, Hermione's doubts about using the book, and girls all over Hogwarts trying to slip love potions to Harry.  The portraits of the Weasleys' life is well-done.  But these are few and far between. <br /> <br />There are silly \\"love\\" plots, without much depth.  Various students kiss repeatedly, and their friends go \\"eeeww[...]\\" <br /> <br />Most of us have read the previous books, but Rowling counts too much on our memory of tiny details over a two-year span.  She won't tell us about Quidditch scoring, the difference between an O.W.L. and a N.E.W.T., how the invisibility cloak works, where Harry got it, etc. <br /> <br />The book is a really quick read for its length, and the development of plot almost exclusively through dialogue is way over-done.  The list price of $29.99 seems a bit misleading when it's sold many places for about $19. <br /> <br />I really hope Rowling gets her spark back with the next book. <br /> <br />	2005-07-24

We learn more about Jim Chee's life progress in the context of a murder mystery, which is neither too complex, nor too simplistic.  Hillerman throws in the Navajo history, lore and lifestyle without preaching, or assuming knowledge on the part of the reader.  In a neat touch, we learn an awful lot about Mary Landon without her actually appearing here as character:  she's there in Jim's memory, in phone calls, and in a letter she sends Jim.<br />Well worth reading!	2004-02-11

I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased.  The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is &quot;borders on idolatry,&quot; that fundamentalists are &quot;often parasitic&quot; and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to &quot;other approaches.&quot;  Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having &quot;a totally closed world view,&quot; and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.<br />Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was.  The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title.	2004-02-11

McManus does a great job of balancing facts, context, and individual soldiers' memories of the war, including excellent presentations on soldiers' food, equipment, weapons, fighting conditions, attitudes, leadership, and motivation -- not to mention a detailed refutation of a &quot;scholarly&quot; study of how most soldiers avoided combat.  <BR>Now, as one reviewer said, if you've read 100 books on World War II, everything you read on the same subject has some repetition to it.  But if you've only read 20 or 25 books, like me -- or if this is going to be your first book on World War II -- this book will be well worth reading.<BR>McManus especially manages to convey that American soldiers were effective and proud, while staying away from the &quot;American soldiers do no wrong and defeat every enemy&quot; fallacy, and avoiding portraying combat as something glorious.<BR>The passages on fatalism were well-done, as soldiers realized that the probable outcomes for them consisted of getting killed, wounded, or captured.  Wounding was preferable.  One soldier writes, &quot;My glove was blown off and a big spurt of blood reddened the white snow....  I could not believe this had happened to me.  I was not meant to be shot.  Acceptance came slowly as two medics worked on me.  My thoughts turned to good thoughts.  I was still alive.  I should have been killed.  I was OK and I was getting out of this frozen hell.&quot;  And another soldier reports, &quot;Sgt Glisch came walking by me, heading rearward.  There was a hole in his helmet and blood running down his face -- a face that was covered with a boyish grin.  That million dollar wound!   I felt left out, and wished I had a bullet through an arm or a leg.&quot;<BR>If you're interested in human nature, US history, psychology, conflict, armed conflict, warfare, and/or World War II, this is a great book!	2003-11-30

Yet in the background, horses are injured, jockeys suffer severe injuries while racing with no medical help, and even Seabiscuit's jockey needs to hide the fact that he's blind in one eye.  Jockeys ruin their bodies while drastically reducing to ridiculous weights (right before engaging in a demanding and dangerous sport) because that's what's allowed by the racing rules, and the Racing Commission ruins lives by making tyrannical and unappealable decisions.	2003-10-09

Segregation, then, was considered to be a &quot;lower-class white attitude.&quot;<BR>It wasn't until approximately 1900 that a very segregationist attitude came about in the South, largely as the result of the interplay of Republican, Democratic, and Progressive politics.<BR>This is course gives the lie to assertion through much of the 1900's that de jure racial segregation was a time-honored part of Southern life, and there was no possible alternative.<BR>Woodward then goes on to describe the depths to which Jim Crow legislation sank, describing the effect of African American migration within the country, World War II, how our segregationist policies hurt the US image abroad, and on to the beginnings of the civil rights movement, ending shortly after _Brown v. Board of Education_, well before the major civil rights events and legislation.<BR>Fairly quick read, and a great book!	2003-09-29

Twenty years later he finds himself, now the director of the VA's Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service, as a US team member re-establishing contact with Vietnam to determine their humanitarian needs.  Downs faces his own prejudices and memories as he deals with his former enemies, and walks a political tightrope as the US tries to extend aid to Vietnam, without making it appear as though the US was trading aid for missing American soldier remains.  Downs also examines his own preoccupation with his service in Vietnam, asserting, &quot;Once a man has contributed his blood and his honor to a country, he is always a part of what it becomes.&quot;  His own veteran friends question his actions in &quot;helping the enemy.&quot;<BR>Downs' descriptions of life in late 1980's northern Vietnam are well-written and informative, as is his verbal portrait of his North Vietnamese counterpart, Dr. Bui Tung.<BR>A deeper book examining how the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong soldiers fought the war, written by former US soldiers who go through their own feelings of &quot;dealing with the enemy,&quot; is _ Inside the Vc and the Nva: The Real Story of North Vietnam's Armed Force_ by Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg.	2003-09-28

That attempt  failed.  In fact, the Coast Guard ship had to come out and rescue THEM.  Yes, you can be a hero for an attempt, but let's not go overboard in naming our book after one rescue attempt in a much bigger event, where other agencies have a much better claim of being \\"the real life heroes.\\"<BR>The book focuses on \\"a PJ,\\" coincidentally the author, not PJ's in general. The Perfect Storm part takes 30 pages, IF you include the soap opera parts about the wives calling each other for news. A pararescue helicopter and tanker was dispatched during the Perfect Storm to rescue a sailor doing a solo trip around the world. The rescue was aborted due to heavy seas, and the rescue helicopter itself ditched on the way back to base, with the loss of one airman. The helicopter ditched because it was unable to refuel with the existing drogue design. The author, in charge at the base, grounded rescue attempts of this airman due to his orders and impossible conditions.  Because his men were angry at him for this, they made life hell for him:  They stole his jacket, and snuck a bottle of booze into his luggage as he was about to fly into a Muslim country, which if discovered would have gotten Jack in enormous trouble. There's so much talk of the PJ \\"teamwork\\" ethos in the book -- but where did \\"teamwork\\" go when his men acted in petty ways, and caused Jack to have to leave command of the unit?<BR>Parts of the book are interesting. Jack, of course, makes almost no mistakes, and his wife is a perfect angel. She understands when he says, \\"yes, I went to the strip bar, but that's where the debriefing session was held.\\"<BR>The unexamined assumption that OF COURSE men who work hard have to relax by drinking all night, having bar fights, and visiting strip joints is overdone.<BR>The book does provide informationabout a little-understood group of airmen who put their lives on the line to rescue others in what can be very difficult situations, much like the Coast Guard rescue jumpers. Their main purpose is to rescue downed pilots and personnel in need of medical help, on land or sea, but they're also available to help civilians when civilian rescue agencies don't have the resources available.<BR>There is some understanding of the mentality of repeatedly putting your life on the line -- you might as well die doing something you love, while helping others.<BR>Although the author reports many accounts of mission failure and limitation due to a poor drogue design, making it difficult to for helicopters to refuel from tankers during rough weather, the author doesn't argue for a better, heavier, longer, wider (or whatever) fueling drogue design.	2003-06-28

This is the best, the ONE book you should read if you're limited to one book.  Other recommended books are _To Bear Any Burden: The Vietnam War and Its Aftermath in the Words of Forty-Seven Americans and Southeast Asians_ by Al Santoli, and _Our Vietnam/Nuoc Viet Ta: A History of the War 1954-1975_ by A. J. Langguth. <BR>With first-hand knowledge -- not just reading from second-hand sources or going through one general's papers -- George Allen describes what happened in Vietnam from before Dien Bien Phu through the fall of Saigon.  He has detailed information on the US side, and informed accounts of what the North Vietnamese strategy was.  He introduces us to the personalities and events so important to the way Vietnam happened, all in a very engaging and readable style.<BR>One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the listing of the many times the US took action without a full examination of the complete situation.  Allen writes, \\"In foreign affairs and national security matters, there is no substitute for thorough, conscientious, and objective analysis of all the factors bearing on a decision, of alternative courses of action, and of a weighing of the consequences -- domestic as well as foreign -- of all the options available.\\"  This was rarely done in Vietnam.  Among the hasty decisions the US made were to consider the northern Vietnamese as part of a monolithic Communist threat, to aid the French in maintaining their empire, to take over the French role in Vietnam, to give the green light to the Diem coup, to not realize the problems the lack of post-Diem leadership would create, to not encourage South Vietnam to develop an effective political message and a stable appealing government, to appear to favor Thieu as a candidate (by proclaiming neutrality), by failing to build an effective intelligence system in south Vietnam, by US in-country personnel repeatedly lyingto their superiors by exaggerating US success and minimizing enemy strength (thus depriving themselves of the needed resources to meet the real threat), by the false \\"light at the end of the tunnel\\" PR campaign (setting the government up for an even bigger fall when Tet '68 came), by giving South Vietnam false assurances of our post-withdrawal support, etc. etc.  <BR>These just touch the surface.  Allen explains how even minor decisions like insisting ARVN units included artillery support, and not replacing ONE incompetent colonel, possibly had very significant bad effects.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Vietnam, recent American history, or politics.  It should be required reading for US policy-makers.  <BR>Hopefully someday we'll have someone the caliber of George Allen tell the true story of 9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq.	2003-06-21

This was genius!<BR>After reading this book, you will never enter a store or restaurant without examining its design and displays.  Underhill describes the \\"zones\\" of a store or restaurant.<BR>There's a time or two when Underhill gives contradictory opinions.  One time, he says that computers should be displayed set up with their peripherals, ready to work, so that customers can try them out.    But, another time, Underhill says customers want to see all similar $300 printers lined up together for comparison.<BR>There are several things Underhill doesn't mention which are major sales inhibitors.  Stores may have the best designed signage displaying the menu items or identifying aisles, and then put up large advertising banners a few feet in front of those signs, so that customers can't read the original signs without getting right under them.  Many fast food outlets also neglect clearing and wiping tables.  Yes, customers are expected to clear their own tables, but if they don't, the staff should promptly do so.  Otherwise, the company spends millions in advertising to get customers into a restaurant, and the negligence of a manager chases the customer out.  Many a time fast food customers will find napkins, straws and utensils stuffed into dispensers so tightly that it's near impossible to retrieve them. <BR>Likewise, Underhill barely mentions the effects of employees' broken promises and faulty information.  How many of us have shopped at a Orchard Supply-type hardware store, to have an employee promise to send someone to help you and never return?  Or have an employee tell you they don't sell such an item in the store, and it turns out later they do?  Frequently the reverse happens, when the employee swears the item can be found waaay across the store in aisle 3, where it doesn't exist.<BR>Underhill says video stores should play movies suitable to all audiences, but it's often the case, especially later in the evening, that customers will have to shop under blaring rock music.   In some stores, such as a mall Radio Shack I visited recently, the teen employees were engaged in such an animated conversation among themselves that customers didn't feel welcome to interrupt them, for the purposes of getting help or ringing up a purchase.<BR>This book is worth reading.  In reading the book, you'll see that some stores have incorporated his suggestions in the four years since publication.	2003-06-21

On Ms. Anderson, the author writes that &quot;when an elegant, beautiful black woman like Marian Anderson became a success, and did so with dignity and class, this message undermined the basis for racism in the first place, by revealing a black woman who in every way but her skin color matched the most successful whites.&quot;  I then continued on to read the portrayals of the other seven women.<BR>Even if you've read multiple biographies on the women portrayed in this book -- Eleanor Roosevelt, Dorothy Thompson, Margaret Mead, Katharine Hepburn, Babe Didrikson Zaharias, and Martha Graham -- you will pick up something new and interesting in the chapters of this book.

I've heard Dr. Watson speak publicly twice, and each time he was asked about her.  When he was interviewed on NPR, the interviewer persistently went into the interactions between Watson and Franklin.  The gist of his response is that she lost the recognition she should have gotten because she refused to collaborate and work with others, and she refused to work with models.  Clearly, while Franklin's X-ray photograph of DNA was a major step in pointing Watson and Crick to the double helix AT GC structure of DNA, it was NOT a self-sufficient proof of the double helix, as she herself refused to consider a helical structure of DNA.	2003-06-12

This book is FULL of fascinating tales and insights, providing enough detail to be rich, but not enough to be stilted.  The book reads like a good spy novel, except fiction is bounded by realm of the possible, and these are real people.<br />This book goes well beyond \\"this happened, and then that happened.\\"  The author explains the relevant history and structure of Nazi Germany, and examines the political and psychological pressures on the various countries, spy organizations, and on the agents themselves.  Worker activists and communists were helpful to the Allies as spies during the war, but dumped soon afterward.<br />One tale is of \\"Cicero,\\" the Albanian valet to the British ambassador to Ankara, who stole volumes of critical information from the ambassador's safe and sold it to the Germans, including the \\"Overlord\\" code name of the Normandy invasion.  Even after being warned, the British allowed Cicero to stay in his position for months.  Yet another twist happens as conflicts and jealousies within German intelligence led the Germans to discount the actual intelligence Cicero provided.  And as the final twist, the £300,000 paid by the Germans to Cicero was all counterfeit money.<br />One of the most fascinating stories is how the Germans came to build their \\"last stand\\" National Redoubt in Austria.  It started as a wholly mistaken OSS intelligence rumor -- the Germans had no such plan.  But when the Germans intercepted the American radio report of such \\"German plans,\\" the National Redoubt idea was sent to Hitler and implemented.  A lot of our scarce espionage capabilities were misdirected to examining enemy plans in the \\"National Redoubt\\" area during the war.  American troops at the end of the European war left Berlin to the Russians, and turned to Austria to vanquish the very same almost-empty \\"National Redoubt\\" chimera we'd created.<br />One helpful insight of the book was on the issue of whether the majority of ordinary Germans knew the purpose of the concentration camps.  One capable spy, doing his best to make observations, with an anti-Nazi bias (both characteristics unlike most Germans), reported that the only information most Germans had of the purpose of the concentration camps came from what they may have heard from American propaganda, which they dismissed, because Allied anti-German propaganda in World War I had been so exaggerated.  The majority of Germans, if they knew of the camps, assumed they were places of confinement and not extermination.  This did not apply, of course, to the minority of Germans involved with the camps, and perhaps those living near the camps.<br />The author goes into the psychology of what makes a good spy, in a very paranoid \\"papers, please\\" regime, who is always pushing the envelope, always at the the risk of capture and torture and perhaps execution, but yet must survive in order to pass his/her information back to the Allies.  What was the right type of man or woman to send into Nazi Germany with an important and delicate mission?  (One description:  \\"The ideal candidate was honest and devious, inconspicuous and audacious, quick and prudent, zealous and cool.\\")  Should the OSS recruit ordinary captured German soldiers?  Was it ethical to make promises to potential spies which couldn't be kept?  How could the OSS tell who was telling the truth, and who had contrary motives -- or determine who had the character to perform well in extreme circumstances?<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in politics, history, or espionage.troops at the end of the European war left Berlin to the Russians, and turned to Austria to vanquish the very same almost-empty \\"National Redoubt\\" chimera we'd created.  <BR>One helpful insight of the book was on the issue of whether the majority of ordinary Germans knew the purpose of the concentration camps.

As a memoir, it's lacking in details.  The author was seduced by her large salary.  Well, how large was it?  Was it $200,000, or $2,000,000?  She won't say.  After preaching about the importance of an accounting firm's need to be independent of its clients, she mentions in passing that her husband is/was the executive director of an Andersen client.  WHILE she was a partner at Andersen?  She doesn't say, as she doesn't mention the possible conflict of interest.<BR>The most interesting aspect of the book is its case study of how Andersen's own structure was set up to reward corporate infighting, extreme territorialism, poor service to clients, overcharging of clients, risk-taking, and lack of long-term planning.  No client got both good service AND a fair price, some clients got neither.  The firm became so fixated on its revenue that anything was done to make a big client, such as Enron, happy.  \\"Keep the client happy, no matter what the consequences.\\"  She concludes that a defective corporate \\"cultural practice\\" can shape the behavior of its employees.<BR>The book's several chapters take several \\"runs\\" at the same events, so the chronology is a bit mixed, especially for those of us who don't date events by who was SEC head at the time.  A timeline would have been helpful, as would a few photographs, or even drawings.  She writes at length about the significance of the different Andersen logos, and the geography and layouts of its campuses through Andersen's history -- why not show them to the reader?<BR>Thebook would have been a great venue to provide a brief examination of what exactly Enron did wrong;  however, Toffler's account of Enron's wrongdoing is less than you'll find in a detailed newspaper article.  There's also a blooper early on when she describes the \\"date-stamping\\" of papers to prepare for litigation.  The term is really \\"Bates stamping,\\" and refers to the Bates stamp machine, which sequentially numbers sheets of paper.<BR>The book is a moderately quick read, a bit too wordy in places, not wordy enough in others -- worth picking up at the library.	2003-05-19

The report of the actual concert at the Memorial is short. There's no discussion of how the concert, the controversy surrounding it, and Anderson herself may have influenced the country's views on civil rights. The author uses the word \\"Negro\\" to refer to Anderson's race; that term was appropriate in 1939, but not now.<BR>The afterword by the illustrator is just silly, since he spends much of his time telling us how his uncle knew both Eleanor Roosevelt and Marian Anderson, until he gets to the end of his afterword and says, paraphrased, \\"just kidding -- my uncle made it up!\\" The illustrator continues this joke at our expense by making his absent, lying uncle a primary character in the drawing of the audience at the Lincoln Memorial. <BR>The afterword (\\"Encore\\") by the author is helpful, as are the suggestions for further reading and viewing. <BR>The theme of Ryan's book is that Anderson fulfills her girlhood dream of singing at the Met, and is the first African American to do so. Everything else is essentially an incident along that road. There's more to Anderson's life than that.<BR>The main flaw of this book is that the text uses too-complex terms to convey a story which is paradoxically too simple. It leaves out important parts of Anderson's life, such as her first \\"flopped\\" concert in New York, and her life after the Met. There are other books which provide more reality, and/or a more child-oriented text (such as Patricia and Fredrick McKissack's _Marian Anderson: A Great Singer_).

Leaders face the generic question of which groups of people define a \\"nation,\\" deserving of self-determination. Do shared race, religion, ethnicity, language, or even alphabet comprise a \\"nation\\" ? <BR>No, this is not Baghdad 2003, but Paris 1919.<BR>As an earlier review said, the story of the post-World War I peace conference in Paris in 1919 is a \\"complex series of parallel stories,\\" which are masterfully told by author MacMillan. The author provides in-depth coverage of the peace conference, while also giving the reader background on the history of each country and important diplomat, providing an understanding of each country's motivations and agenda in Paris, together with each delegation's political pressures at home.<BR>It was definitely a different time -- a time of paternalism and colonies -- a time when Wilson could pontificate about self-determination, but shoot down a proposed clause in the treaty calling for racial equality. The racial equality clause was proposed by our Japanese allies who were insulted by laws such as California's, which not only segregated Japanese but prohibited land ownership by Japanese. The dismissal of this Japanese proposal helped put Japan and the U.S. on an adversarial path.<BR>It was a time when the British blithely decided that the very different peoples in Mesopotamia should be brought together into what are now the borders of Iraq.<BR>The respective rights of Zionists and Palestinians in the Middle East were at issue.<BR>A young kitchen assistant at the Paris Ritz hotel sent in a petition asking that his native country, Vietnam, be granted independence from France. The petition was ignored, and the kitchen assistant was Ho Chi Minh.<BR>The conference also faced the issues of the end of the Russian monarchy, and the new Bolshevik revolution. Although the Bolsheviks weren't in control of all Russia, should the Bolsheviks be recognized and invited to Paris? The political missteps here helped convince the Soviets that the Allies were not their friends.<BR>Perhaps the largest issue, of course, was how to treat Germany. How important was it to assign \\"guilt\\" to Germany for World War I? How just was it to compel war reparation payments from Germany? What should have been included in the \\"bill\\" ? How large should those payments have been -- how much of Germany's economic product should be taken from it? Did the fact, and size, of these payments contribute to the rise of Hitler, and the Second World War? MacMillan deals with these issues at length.<BR>The Paris Peace conference came down to several men sitting in a room and talking, remaking the world as they did. The ramifications of what they decided will continue well into the future. MacMillan says, \\"If they could have done better, they certainly could have done much worse.\\"<BR>I recommend this book to anyone interested in the historical underpinnings of the current world situation. When you finish it, it's like listening to the Paul Harvey feature -- \\"and now you know the rest of the story.\\"	2003-05-06

Protagonist Harry Bosch is neither too perfect, nor too flawed.  His girlfriend has her own personality, motivations, and job;  she's not there for mere decoration.  The quick conversations between Bosch and Chandler during courtroom smoking breaks are a nice touch.  The aspects of the case which cause Bosch to examine his own past, and motivations, separates this from the too-common &quot;good guys versus bad guys action&quot; type books.  It's also good to read a book which doesn't rely on a deus ex machina ending.<BR>There are a few bloopers along the way.  Lawyers would not abide a US district judge who commented on their opening arguments to the jury with &quot;They may make some highfalutin allegations, but just because they say it doesn't make it true.  After all, they're lawyers [pronounced lie-yers].&quot;<BR>A real estate agent would be unlikely to hold an open house because she has two interested buyers.  (Open houses are held to _get_ buyers, not because you have them.)<BR>Improper statements made in court are _not_ &quot;struck from the record.&quot;  If the statements were deleted from the record, it would be impossible to argue their effect to the court of appeals.<BR>If an attorney died, attorney fees would still be owed -- to the attorney's estate.<BR>If Mora's divorce took place in California in the mid-1980's, mental cruelty would not be a ground of divorce -- that was eliminated in 1970.  Connelly's use of the term &quot;loss of consortium&quot; is outside the usual context -- the term is usually used in cases where an injury to one spouse prevents marital relations, not a divorce where a spouse decides to stop relations.<BR>In all, it's a worthwhile and entertaining book for a day or two's good read.  See if you can figure out who the Follower is before Bosch does!	2003-04-29

Much of the book revolves around race -- the pervasive discrimination in the South in the 1960's, and how a good person should react to it.  At one point, the narrator says, &quot;Up until then I'd thought that white people and colored people getting along was the big aim, but after that I decided everybody being colorless together was a better plan.&quot;<br />As powerful as this book is, it's a fairly quick read.  The ending is a bit too neat, and as others have noted, some of the plot is improbable.  This would be a good book to pick up at the library if you can find it -- at my local library, there are fifty-five people on the waiting list for this book!<br />The fact that the author has an extensive web page, complete with book discussion, is a nice plus (the author's name . com).	2003-04-28

I read it, and finished it, because it was recommended to me by a friend who saw me reading _The Invisible Soldier_ by Mary Penick Motley.<br />The book's dreamlike, and occasionally nightmarish, qualities detract from its effectiveness.  When the narrator takes Norton on the drive around campus, the events turn nightmarish -- through virtually no fault of the narrator, events turn into a drawn-out out-of-control nightmare where things unbelievably keep getting worse and worse.  The narration by Trueblood seems interminable, as do the bizarre events at the Golden Day.<br />Not only does Dr. Bledsoe banish the narrator from college, but he does so in a manner where the narrator doesn't even feel the knife in his back, and even unknowingly becomes the instrument of his own further destruction.  Dr. Bledsoe's actions are typical of those who later interact with the narrator.  Is Bledsoe acting to protect his own position, or the continuation of the college, or the furtherance of the African American race, or to benefit the narrator?<br />Continually through the book, the narrator is faced with the decision of speaking out and becoming a target, or remaining silent and assenting to injustice.  The groups and individuals which attract, use, or attack the narrator are archetypes of later groups in the civil rights movement:  the Brotherhood represents those who would deny African American leadership in the movement in the name of brotherhood and unity, while Ras represents a very separatist movement.<br />For all its historic significance and eloquence, there are better choices than this book.  Ellison himself says in his forward, with regard to African American service in World War II, &quot;How could you treat a Negro as equal in war and then deny him equality during times of peace?&quot;  For an excellent book on African American soldiers in World War II, read _The Invisible Soldier_ by Mary Penick Motley.  And of course for a more objective, less dreamlike, odyssey, read _Black Like Me_ by John Griffin.

Jake tells Joanna he plans to handle two suspects \\"the old-fashioned way....  I'm going to shove them in a corner and scare the hell out of them.\\"<BR>When a suspect implies Jake is stupid, Jake lifts the suspect into the air by his shirt.<BR>When an attorney objects to Jake questioning his client, Jake threatens to take the attorney and his client to jail, where they'll sit in the cold interrogation room.<BR>When an intern refuses Jake admittance to the doctor's lounge, Jake threatens, \\"the last thing you want to do is get in the way of [an angry and upset] cop.\\"  Jake then picks the intern up by his armpits and moves him aside.  Jake also misrepresents himself as \\"an officer of the court.\\"  <BR>There's a misogynist thread to the book.  A \\"middle aged\\" female neurosurgeon can't get anyone to sleep with her unless she pays them money.  Women are continually described, and judged, depending on whether they have a \\"great body.\\"  Women are excluded from the list of murder suspects because women \\"kill with knives or poison or sometimes guns.  But they don't bash people over the head....  And it would take a man to lift a dead body and lug it down the corridor....\\"<BR>Goldberg's characters repeatedly define \\"nanotechnology\\" as meaning \\"where everything is scaled down a billion times.\\"  Although a nanometer is a billionth of a meter, it does NOT follow that nanotechnology is technology scaled down a billion times.  Instead, nanotechnology is technology with dimensions of, usually, less than 100 nanometers.  In a broader definition, nanotechnology can mean any sub-micron technology.  Human hair is about 40,000 nanometers, or 40 microns, wide.<BR>Goldberg finally puts his own previous book, Deadly Exposure, in the nightstand of one of this book's characters.  That's just too cutesy.<BR>This book is formulaic, Neanderthal, and lacking any elementary fact-checking.  Skip this one -- hold out for the next one where, hopefully, Jake will be arrested for assault and rightfully thrown off the force and into jail.	2003-04-13

While each story is different, common themes are that preserving white supremacy was a preeminent motivation of American life, and that such discrimination was usually enforced or condoned by the federal government through the military.  If African American soldiers were allowed to succeed, that would bring the Jim Crow system into question.<BR>The author skillfully orders these narratives, also noting the role played by each soldier and unit noted in a brief introduction before each narrative.  These soldiers give the facts, their opinions, and some general observations.  \\"At times it actually seemed that the white man would rather lose the war than give the black man the recognition he so clearly deserved.\\"<BR>The African American had two enemies -- the Germans, and the white soldiers and civilians.  Southern law officers might force African American soldiers to march in the ditch, since the very highways were reserved for whites.<BR>There were times that African American soldiers would fight white soldiers who provoked them.  In the South, this might lead to a lynch mob.   A number of accounts note that German POWs were granted privileges denied to active duty African American soldiers.  One soldier notes that he had to walk down an alley to the back of an eatery in Texas to order food, while German POWs were allowed to eat inside;  this was a common practice in the South.  In the South, African American access to the base PX would be restricted.  <BR>Trained African American soldiers were assigned to stevedore duty.  Trained African American pilots were assigned to guard airbases which were in no danger of enemy attack.  White officers were promoted or transferred, to prevent them from having to follow the orders of an African American officer of higher rank in their unit.  Officers' clubs were \\"separate but unequal.\\"   Only when mixed with African Americansin actual combat against the Germans, did whites treat African Americans equally.  There were rare exceptions of white officers and units who stood up to this segregation.<BR>This book is full of hundreds of such memories and incidents.  Some incidents recount how African American soldiers interacted with other minorities in the army, and with the citizens of different countries.  This book is slow reading, because each incident generates thought, but it is well worth reading.	2003-04-12

Books	1	15	32	N	N	A catchy title, one good chapter, and that's it	I'm amazed that this book became a best-seller -- it must have been the catchy title.<BR>The book swings back and forth between political commentary (containing many factual errors) to inconsistency and silliness.  Moore can't even keep the definition of his central term straight:  does \\"white\\" mean those who share a skin pigment, as when Moore writes, \\"every time I see a white guy walking toward me, I tense up,\\" or does \\"white\\" mean \\"conservative attitude,\\" as when he claims that the \\"Stupid White Virus ... has even infected ringers like Colin Powell [and] ... Condoleeza Rice,\\" concluding at the end of the book that the Democratic party is as bad as the Republican, and so we should vote for independents like Ralph Nader and Jesse Ventura?<BR>The only positive thing about this book is that Chapter One contains a good analysis of exactly how Florida stole the votes of thousands of African American and other Democratic-leaning voters.  One decent chapter, though, is the equivalent of a magazine article, and does not justify buying this book.	2003-04-08

This story could have been well-told in roughly half its 380 pages. While I don't object to scene-setting and description, Grafton's style here is too predictable: EVERY time Kinsey meets someone, there will immediately follow one or two paragraphs on what the person is wearing. The repeated health problems of her police buddies -- and the junk food ecstasies -- get old with constant repetition.<BR>Virtually every time Kinsey knocks on a door, or makes a phone call, she gets solid information from someone willing to talk with her.  In real life, investigators -- much less non-police investigators -- much more frequently knock on doors and make phone calls when folks aren't home, or won't talk.<BR>This book is a pass.	2003-04-04

This is an incredible book on a reporter's year as a teacher in an inner city school.  Ms. Sachar provides a needed and welcome inside perspective on many of the controversial issues in education.<BR>Teachers cannot use the same techniques that are used in industry:  software engineers don't deal with programs which don't WANT to run, and lumbermills don't have to convince their lumber to WANT to be cut.  Nor does the lumbermill have to deal with the trees' parents.  One tree is just like another:  line it up and cut it.  Yet, teachers work with students who are all different, and whose intrinsic motivation is crucial to the teacher's success in changing them.  <BR>Emily Sachar deeply explores the issues of racial tensions and preferences among the staff and students, social promotion, the problems of eliminating ineffective administrators and teachers, needless paperwork, unreasonable expectations, inadequate facilities and funding, the despair and wonder of teaching, and more.<BR>These are woven through the personal and moving narrative of her year-long odyssey as a new teacher.<BR>This is a superb book, which I highly recommend.	2003-04-02

Judges would not need to recuse themselves because they were appointed by the victim's predecessor.  The Perry Mason TV series didn't have &quot;trials,&quot; but preliminary hearings.  <BR>The characters are largely one-dimensional, and the writing style is a bit silly.<BR>These might be overlooked, but in his Acknowledgements, Buckley claims he had the help of several &quot;distinguished attorneys,&quot; plus &quot;a peerless editor,&quot; and &quot;the keen eyes of Gregory Zorthian and William F. Buckley Jr.,&quot; AND a relentless and superb fact checker.  In other words, Christopher Buckley had to work fairly hard to produce the merely-mediocre execution of what could have been a good book.	2003-03-27

The \\"letters to Larry\\" parts seemed distracting.  But, I had previously read another book by Chris Crutcher, and so hung in there.<BR>About the fourth chapter, everything came together.  Letters to Larry were a nice additional reflection.  The plot is interesting and well-done.  <BR>Each character is well-defined, and is \\"seen\\" through multiple points of view.  Teens (and adults) reading this book will have a renewed ability to think about others in their totality -- to consider how that person got his/her behavior, and to look at others' points of view.<BR>I believe this book will be beneficial to all teens, and especially those who are having trouble controlling their anger, or are going through difficulties or abuse in their lives -- particularly difficulties with parents and authority figures.  The author, through his characters, offers advice on how to deal with anger problems.<BR>I highly recommend this book for those in the appropriate age levels.	2003-03-25

Amazing book	\\"Ain't it a trip where heroes come from.\\"  Chris Crutcher thus sums up the greatness found in many unexpected places.  His book swings from this greatness to the loneliness, despair and even horror we find among the commonplace.  \\"One thing I know:  Families can get pretty messed up while they're looking pretty good.\\"<BR>This is a superbly-written and very moving book.

But yes, Gary shows here he can write an engaging book about his past.<BR>With a wry, understated sense of humor, he takes us through his experiences with boats -- from the first time he was entranced with the sea, to his future plans.<BR>He tells stories of events that most authors would rather forget -- from his initial brash overconfidence, almost getting \\"taken\\" by a fast-talking boat salesperson, and how he came close to death several times through lack of knowledge and clues about sea conditions that would be obvious to experienced sailors.<BR>This book is even interesting reading for adults who want to know more about Gary Paulsen.<BR>The title has a nice twist to it -- Paulsen writes how the sea \\"caught\\" him in the sense of being his captivated by the sea, and how the sea several times \\"caught\\" him in the sense of almost killing him.	2003-03-19

I agree with the others' comments that many of the details in the book seem invented, inconsistent, and inaccurate.  Unfortunately, it seems that \\"a true story\\" in a title invariably means \\"a fictionalized story.\\"<BR>Just as there is no photograph of Bobby in life in the book, the only photos of the seven defendants are their mugshots -- and even these aren't labeled, unless you scan them and enlarge them several times to read the infinitesimal print on the sheriff department forms. (Left to right they are Alice, Lisa, Heather, Derek D., Derek K., Donald, and Marty at bottom.) Nor is there any synopsis of who they are besides the pictures -- \\"this is Donald, Ali's new boyfriend, who struck the first blow\\" would be helpful. The book further has no index, nor list of sources. According to the author blurb, the author has lived and worked in Detroit, Houston and Dallas -- what is his familiarity with, and connection with, this Florida trial? What sources did he use? This is particularly important because Schutze purports to take us inside the minds of several of the defendants, into private conversations where one party is now dead, and into attorney-client conferences.<BR>It's hard to see what purpose author Schutze was trying to accomplish by very graphic and repeated descriptions of Bobby and Marty's time in gay bars and the gay porn video they produced.<BR>The number of pages Schutze gives to each subject is interesting: he gives 94 pages to establishing the characters, there are 63 pages covering the development of the murder plot, it takes Bobby 11 pages to die, there are 49 pages of cover-up and police work until Derek Dzvirko confesses, 52 more pages pass until Marty's trial starts, and Marty's trial takes up 33 pages. The trials, convictions, and pleas of the other six defendants combined take up a mere two pages. Schutze either hit a deadline, or got tired of writing.<BR>Schutze's book itself focuses on lengthy dialogue -- most likely invented -- and an endless recitation of chronological facts, never getting into underlying causes of this tragedy except for a few passing quotations from the lawyers and media types on the culture that produced the ability to kill. <BR>Yet the tragedy itself provokes much thought. Some defendants came from difficult situations, some seemingly just came from privileged but lax homes. Marty and Bobby take steroids. What is it about being 18 that makes murder seem the logical solution to Bobby's bullying of Marty and Marty's friends -- when the whole thing could have been stopped by Marty telling his parents that he wanted nothing more to do with Bobby? Bobby was capable of physical and emotional abuse, but only of those who voluntarily hung out with him -- or were mentally handicapped. <BR>Yet the events of a few days, by these primarily 18-year-olds, at the same time both worldly and naive, led one to be killed, three of them to get life sentences, one a death sentence, and the other three a total of 58 years in prison (originally) -- not to mention the effects on their families and children. What could have stopped each of them on the way to this train wreck? Who (the defendants, their parents, society, and/or Bobby) is responsible for Bobby's death in whole or part? The book is silent on this, but the situation lends itself to much thought.<BR>While I don't recommend this book due to its many faults, anyone interested in the story of a school bully who COULDN'T be avoided, and COULDN'T be stopped with adult intervention, and who was almost murdered to stop his bullying, should read the true graphic novel _My War with Brian_ by Ted Rall.	2003-03-12
US	53071138	RECPNKRP6X20J	0553562738	466136665	Doomsday Book	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Well worth reading!	I agree with a number of the previous reviews -- the author does a GREAT job of providing details, especially in the 14th century section of the book. It's almost like a Connecticut Yankee, who happens to be a historian, intentionally returns to King Arthur's Court -- except she returns for real, to a small village instead of the king's court, there won't be any knights on bicycles riding to the rescue, no fortuitous eclipses, and all modern conveniences, except a hidden note taker, have been left at home. <BR>Willis' skill in putting the reader INTO a setting and making the reader CARE about events is like Stephen King's ability in that regard. There are enough mysteries and plot twists and red herrings and subtle humor to keep the reader happy. Yet, many of the modern characters, and a number of the 14th century characters, are fairly plain. This is understandable in part because reader's perspective in the 14th century half, although the book is written in the third person,  is generally limited to the knowledge of the protagonist who is a brief \\"foreign\\" visitor. <BR>Yet it's more than that:  the characters are given a personality and a role and they pretty much stick to that: this one is the kindly professor, that one is the pretentious academic prima donna. Even the protagonist is easily classified as the \\"kind-hearted, sensitive, and very dedicated student.\\" Aside from choosing this potentially dangerous research, she doesn't face any real difficult decisions about which action to take, or whom to help.  She briefly wishes she could import modern medicine through the time portal into the village, but that thought isn't developed.  (This would have violated the book's equivalent of a \\"prime directive\\" for time travel.)<BR>The medieval part of the book is most interesting: the villagers were facing the imminent death of themselves and most of the people they knew, from a cause they don't understand; while the modern plague causes some deaths, one of the major modern concerns is running out of toilet paper.<BR>I was sad to hear that the author's research on which were the common diseases in medieval Europe was lacking. <BR>While the length of the book allows Willis ample room to bring the reader into the setting, it was too long, especially in the modern half of the book. Not only is the paperback 578 pages, but Willis uses 43 lines of text per page, while most paperbacks use 28 to 32 lines per page:  this is the equivalent of an 800-page book.  It's still a moderately quick read because the plot is so engrossing, and it's SO tempting to start skimming when you get to the modern parts of the story.  While the writing is consistently very good, it's too long. Definitely do NOT get the unabridged audio.	2003-03-07

This is a superb book I happened to pick up at the library because of its striking cover design.<BR>Each short story is introduced with a short but insightful capsule of what was prominent about that decade, and what was invented in that decade, giving a \\"feel\\" of the spirit of each decade. The tone is very appealing -- just the right amount of detail, oriented toward teens. The short stories are very good in themselves -- appealing plots (often with a twist), multidimensional characters, grand themes, and relevant to the lifestyle of the decade. Following each short story is a description of that story's author, attractively describing the author's other works, and inviting further reading.<BR>In light of the previous review, I re-scanned the \\"60's\\" and \\"70's\\" stories. What profanity there was, was scarce, in context and not worse than I've seen in upper elementary assigned fiction. Regional standards may vary, of course. <BR>The \\"60's\\" story is of Benny Woods, a small-town high school football star who is facing a conflict with his coach over his long hair: cut it, or don't play. The stakes are high, as not playing means losing a potential college scholarship. Benny's relationship with his grandmother is a fascinating side story both personally to Benny, and as it relates to the way our society treats seniors.<BR>The \\"70's\\" story makes light of drug use, but it's told in the style of an obvious fantasy: the protagonist's parents SO want to be \\"hip\\" that they send marijuana brownies and psychedelics to school in their son's lunchbox, while he wants nothing more than to be square.<BR>The only weak and inappropriate story, in my opinion, is the \\"80's\\" story. Mathias Rust, of course, was the 19-year-old who flew a Cessna, undetected, into the heart of Russia and landed in the center of Moscow for the cause of peace in 1987. In the \\"80's\\" story, his supposed brother, Ingo, comes to the US as an exchange student. Ingo pretends to be Mathias in order to be popular with the girls at an all-night under-age drinking party. The drinking party is portrayed as an inevitable and even beneficial teen activity. The quality of the writing is poor, and the connection with grand themes is missing.<BR>In sum, this is an excellent book, except for the \\"80's\\" story!	2003-03-05

Unfortunately, reading the book is just like listening to the author on the radio -- she uses beautiful descriptive language, but there are NO pictures, even though she often verbally describes pictures of the wonderful world of dust she's seen.  <BR>The prose is beautiful, and the coverage of the book is extensive.  Her jump to the view that the Earth will be swallowed up by the sun in the distant future is less likely scientifically than she makes it appear.  And the book tends a bit too much to simplicity instead of thoroughness.<BR>But why would photos, or drawings at least, be left out of a book which could benefit so much from them?  The microscopic world of dust, and the cosmic scale of stardust and global dust flows, is not easily and accurately imagined.  This lack brings the potential rating of the book (4 or 5 stars) down to 2 stars.  Only _after_ the reader goes through over 200 pages of bare text does the reader get to the list of about sixty websites in an appendix at the back of the book -- websites which contain pictures of what she's been talking about.  But, these sites are not grouped on the web, and must be accessed individually by typing in the lengthy URL's -- assuming you still have the interest to go back to see the actual images you were only &quot;picturing&quot; in your mind, AND you have internet access at your reading spot and the time to type in each URL individually.  The book's listing of the first URL I explored had a typo in it, and it took some exploring to find the typo (.html is listed, but the site uses .htm).  How much trouble would it have been to bring all these sites together on an author or book website, so that the reader could click from one to the other?  Couldn't this appendix of websites been mentioned in the introduction or first chapter -- where the reader would be warned to refer to it periodically -- since the website list is apparently a substitute for photos or drawings in the book?<BR>This is a book on the edge of greatness.  Hopefully in future editions of this book, and certainly in Ms. Holmes' future books, relevant photographs and drawings will be included.  Just as Ms. Holmes didn't do her research over the telephone, she should not expect us to grasp the full beauty and understanding of what she describes through mere words.	2003-03-04

Yet, most of his points are well-argued, and while one may certainly disagree with at least some of his conclusions, Wills makes a very good case for the proposition that the church leadership, in many ways in the past and present, twists scriptures and facts, and exposes the most vulnerable of its membership to abuse and unscriptural teachings and needless strictures on their lives, in order to maintain the power and reputation of the church leadership and priesthood.<br />This book is also interesting to the non-Catholic curious about the actions of the Catholic Church in World War II, the origin and development of many Catholic teachings, and fascinating stories about the origin of the Catholic sects which are encroaching their churches on the concentration camps where so many Jews were killed.<br />Wills assumes too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader in the chapters on Newman and Acton, and the book has a very skimpy index.	2003-02-17

Mick reports that the names are \\"in no particular order,\\" which isn't true -- they're listed in order of death. Mick says he booked a room in a \\"hotel across the street from the White House.\\" The only hotel that fits that description is the Hay-Adams, across Lafayette park. Rooms at the luxurious Hay-Adams start at $300 a night -- a bit unusual for Mick Ballou, who is described as a brutal killer, a career criminal, and someone who drinks whiskey like water.<BR>The sudden mention of the Wall is a plot device, of course, and Scudder later travels to Washington to check whether a certain name is on the wall. Of course, Scudder wouldn't have had to travel -- the Wall names are listed on the internet.<BR>The dnouement is even worse. The group of respectable businessmen decides that the answer to their problems is to hold the killer in solitary confinement for life, in their own private jail cell, located on a small island in Lake Huron. The businessmen use the racist assumption that a \\"family of Cree Indians\\" who work as caretakers of the island will loyally and mutely participate in their conspiracy to kidnap and isolate the killer for life -- complete with a welded leg shackle.<BR>The book started off well, but it really needs a different ending.	2003-02-14

Jance had jumped the shark when J.P. Beaumont got on the plane to Arizona to meet up with Joanna Brady. To the end of the book, the blending of the two characters is pulled off with nary a hitch. The characters stay true to their developed personalities, and act as foils to each other. I do hope this book is their last meeting -- future plot twists to bring them together would probably seem very contrived.<BR>In large part, J.A. Jance breaks away from the trend of so many writers and _improves_ her books as the series goes on. The characters don't suddenly turn into narrow-minded profane caricatures of themselves (as Tom Clancy's do). Aside from getting weepy at a law enforcement funeral at the beginning -- memories of Andy coming back -- and one thought that she and J.P have the death of a spouse in common -- Andy stays well buried and Joanna doesn't go around reminding every person in Bisbee about Andy's death and her widowhood. Jance stays away from grisly death details.<BR>Even when sorely tempted, Joanna and her force are \\"good cops.\\" Unlike Leonard Goldberg's characters, Joanna Blalock and Jake Sinclair, Joanna and her deputies get warrants before searching private property. Witnesses and suspects are treated with respect and professionally interviewed, instead of being beaten and threatened with reprisals for non-cooperation, which Leonard Goldberg thinks is good police procedure. In Cochise County, citizens and suspects alike get a fair shake and value for their money from law enforcement.<BR>There are a few bloopers and inconsistencies in the book. It's not credible that Joanna would even consider, much less obey, a high school principal's paranoid demand that Joanna not bring her gun on campus, when Joanna is there to speak to an assembly. Joanna would know that Arizona Statute 13-3102 states the \\"no deadly weapons on campus\\" law does not apply to peace officers.<BR>It's very unlikely anyone, not even Serenity Granger, could finish law school in a year and half, with or without honors. Jance repeatedly has characters refer to the Arizona \\"DMV.\\" California has a DMV. Arizona has a Motor Vehicle Division (MVD), which is part of the Az. Dept. of Transportation.  Nor do I know of any state where the DMV/ Dept of Transportation keeps track of vehicle colors, as Jance provides.<BR>Jance has town residents drive into Old Mexico to buy leaded fuel for their old cars -- yet there are commercially available bottled leaded fuel substitute additives.  Nor would a fleeing suspect need to use leaded fuel in every tankful, as Jance's plot requires. <BR>With regard to his pistol, Beaumont refers to \\"my wimpy backup handgun,\\" also described as \\"my small backup Glock.\\"  There are no \\"wimpy\\" Glocks, of any size.  <BR>Jance has Rochelle Baxter ingesting a fatal dose of the poison sodium azide, and then continuing to peacefully paint 90 minutes later, and sleeping for another hour. Yet a large dose of sodium azide poisoning produces severe symptoms within 15 minutes. <BR>These are minor blips in an otherwise wonderful book with well-developed multi-dimensional characters and a sensible plot.<BR>The only major plot inconsistency is at the end of the book, where Joanna hugs J.P. to comfort him, and finds a mutual electricity. Joanna then feels rejected when J.P. turns down her offer to drive him to Tucson, lest they be tempted to go further. Now, Jance's Joanna may be forgetful and a bit inconsiderate, and not a little brusque at times, but the thoughts of being unfaithful to her husband Butch are totally out of character.	2003-02-13

What a great book!<BR>This extremely well-edited book covers the topic of the white supremacy movement.  It is detailed, yet concise;  readable, yet informative.  In one 150-page package, using clear type and appropriate subheadings, the book carries the reader through a tour of the history of white supremacy in the US -- particularly the Ku Klux Klan, the skinhead movement, the rise and spread of racist music and video games, the World Church of the Creator, and racist movements in Europe.  It includes a useful index.<BR>One very moving chapter is \\"Personal Encounters with White Supremacy.\\"  This chapter includes first person or interview accounts from a former skinhead, the head of the World Church of the Creator, a woman who married a white supremacist, an activist stalked and threatened by white supremacists, and a white woman who was paralyzed in 1997 by skinheads when she stood up for an African man they were attacking.  The book ends with suggestions on how white supremacy can be combated, including the story of Billings, Montana, which in 1993 united against vandalism against Jewish families.<BR>The book has no pictures -- which may be a good thing:  one cannot skim through looking at the pictures, but one is drawn to the text.  It's also a bit pricey:  books like this one should be as accessible as possible.	2003-01-05

Analysis is largely limited to \\"the President said go, and we went.\\"  Even the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, widely acknowledged to be mistaken, is accepted at face value.  The many interviews quoted at length give the book a very episodic feel.  There is, I believe, not one negative word about the Seals, or their success in Vietnam, in this book.<BR>The pictures and narratives are good in giving the reader a sense of what it's like to be a Seal, how the Seals operate on their missions, the tools they use, and how important the concept of \\"team\\" is to the effectiveness of the Seals.  Buy it for this purpose, if you wish, but not to gain any concept of history.	2002-12-29

On the one hand, the word n* is often used by African Americans in addressing or describing other African Americans; when so used, the word n* is usually a term of affection and/or respect. Africans Americans have three bases of their exclusive right to use the word n*: whites are disqualified due to a history of white racism, African Americans have \\"earned\\" the right to use the word through oppression -- being called n* \\"all these years\\" gives African Americans a literal ownership of the word, and lastly, whites don't understand African American culture sufficiently \\"to use the word n* properly.\\" African American comedians who use the word n* in their routines \\"exhibit a bracing independence\\" and \\"eschew boring conventions.\\" Yet elsewhere Kennedy asserts that in some cases, African American use of the word n* \\"is indicative of an antiblack, self-hating prejudice.\\"<BR>While admitting that the common use of the word n* by African Americans diminishes the ability to censure use of the word by whites, Kennedy argues that \\"what should matter is the context in which the word is spoken -- the speaker's aims, effects, alternatives.\\" Thus a few selected whites are allowed to use the word n* -- for instance, writers such as Twain who used the word in the process of condemning racism, and politicians such as LBJ who had a track record of opposing racial prejudice. Likewise, Kennedy argues, some individual whites who have proven that they abhor prejudice and have a sufficient number of African American friends, are allowed to use the word n*. Yet, almost without exception, if a white person uses the word n*, it's suddenly a racist word. <BR>Kennedy gives a little space to those who condemn African American use of the word. He quotes Bill Cosby, who believes that all African Americans are hurt when the word is used by African Americans: use of the word reinforces the stereotyped negative impressions many whites have of African Americans.<BR>A major failing of the book is that it fails to give a chronological evolution of the word. How relevant and brave, for instance, are the African American comedians and rappers who use the word n* to \\"defang\\" a word which dropped out of accepted pejorative use by the vast majority of whites decades ago? Is it really in society's interest to continually proclaim that races have historical rights -- even if it's the right to \\"defang\\" a word with a shameful past? While the \\"melting pot\\" theory has been rightfully discredited, how far should we go in emphasizing our racial differences and proclaiming our racial linguistic territory?	2002-12-28

He immediately enters into all these improbable and zany adventures, capped by an arrest at the airport as he's getting ready to fly to Acapulco! During his trial, his attorney opts for a temporary insanity defense, which the jury buys because the guy's buddies testify he \\"went bananas\\" for a week when he found the money.<BR>Yet this comedy has an edge to it -- the tragedy of \\"men who were raised to go to work out on the docks like their fathers and uncles and older brothers, only there's no work for them on the docks anymore, and there's nothing else they know how to do.... It's a story about addiction, about the belief that there is a shortcut to true happiness.\\"<BR>When I got to the Epilogue, I was quite surprised to find that this obviously fictional story was true! The author tells what happened after the trial, and how Joey's story was literally Disneyfied -- and how his good fortune turned out to be his tragic ruin.<BR>The typeface used is a bit distracting since there is no \\"1\\" -- and unlike ancient typewriters, instead of the small \\"L,\\" the capital \\"I\\" is used: thus $100 is $I00 and 314 Dunfor Street is 3I4 Dunfor Street.<BR>This is a great book because it encompasses universal themes -- Joey is a Greek tragic figure whose internal flaws, despite his good fortune, emerge to undo him. Many of us, likewise, have envisioned what we would do if sudden riches came upon us.	2002-12-27

When you ride a bike, on the one hand you acquire friends and a lifestyle, and on the other hand much of society will exclude you. <BR>She writes about the feeling among some riders, who have reacted negatively to articles she's written, that &quot;nothing depressing, upsetting, or unfavorable ever be uttered about&quot; riding. <BR>Although each rider belongs to the community of all riders, there are many divisions within the riding life. The brand and style of bike you choose to ride is expected to define your character. While you're in the riding community, you're loyal to your brand -- Pierson rides a Guzzi and writes at length about the &quot;worldwide brotherhood of Moto Guzzi riders.... Guzzis appeal to the middle-class rider who is not too racy, but plenty individualistic.... They attract tinkerers, people for whom good is never good enough, for whom the rituals of necessary maintenance are secret joys.... Never for them a full fairing....&quot;<BR>I would have liked more analysis about the &quot;brand loyalty&quot; aspect of motorcycling. Perhaps the brand you ride is like the Sorting Hat at Hogwarts -- a window into your true self? Why is this so? This brand/personality correlation isn't limited to motorcycles -- just look at the Ford vs. Chevy truck rivalry, or how the type of car you drive reveals your personality. (If I told you I drive a sports car, you'd probably think differently of me than if I told you I drive a minivan.) <BR>Pierson writes about the prejudice and even disbelief that riders and non-riders have toward women riders. When she sits down at a restaurant table with her helmet and orders a meal, the waitress brings two meals -- the second meal for the man who, surely, must belong to the helmet. When she arrives at a toll booth, the toll taker asks, &quot;Did you ride that motorcycle here all by yourself?&quot; She's tempted to answer, &quot;No, I carried it on my head.&quot;<BR>Woven throughout the book are her thoughts and experiences on the psychology of riding and its many aspects -- friendships, relationships, touring, racing, and rallies. She identifies Harley riders as comprising most of those who are &quot;perennial children&quot; and debase their women. I don't see this as &quot;male bashing,&quot; but as an honest and direct appraisal of the behavior of one group of riders -- but she should have been clearer that many Harley riders are not in that group.<BR>The further divisions in the motorcycle hierarchy can be seen in the prior reviews here. You're not &quot;really&quot; a rider if you've &quot;only&quot; ridden 35,000 miles, or if you think riding in the rain is more dangerous, or if you've ever been scared on a bike, or if you can't rebuild your own bike from the ground up. <BR>A book about the romance of riding would be much less if it were not personal. This is a valuable book for everyone who rides, and anyone who is interested in reading about the attractions of the riding life.	2002-10-23
US	53071138	R1GK666LYDOP5P	1565846974	281230412	Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South	Books	5	29	30	N	N	A necessary book	This is an absolutely superb book, comprised of recollections of the Jim Crow years in the form of oral histories. It can be read through, or picked up at any part. There is an appropriate amount of historical introduction to each chapter.<BR>This material needs to be read, and remembered. There was a long time in our history when, although there was no more slavery, African Americans were treated as a separate serf class, under constant pressures and reminders of their lower status. Whites used pervasive legal and social downward pressures to keep African Americans out of an equal education, and equal access to public facilities, much less the right to equal jobs and the right to vote -- and then claimed that African Americans' lack of achievement was a racial fault. If an African American violated one of the many social taboos, the sanctions ranged from a beating, to loss of job, and even being lynched.<BR>While whites benefited from Jim Crow, the whites, also, were trapped in the system. They were also forced to abide by legal segregation, and were subject to social pressure if they were too liberal (being called \\"n* lover,\\" \\"white n*,\\" etc.).<BR>What led to the mindset that the end of slavery should lead to continued legal and social oppression of African Americans? It was part of white American culture. Lincoln himself said that he was not \\"in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry.... [T]here must be the position of superior and inferior. I am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.\\" In 1877, Rutherford B. Hayes traded the end of southern post-war Reconstruction for the electoral votes he needed to win the presidency. Southern states then were free to institute the Jim Crow system. <BR>I believe we are more subject to peer pressure than we would like to believe.  Although reviewer McInerney asserts that \\"no civilized person\\" would benefit from Jim Crow, I feel many otherwise-good people were trapped and/or blinded by their own interests and surroundings. When allowed, and even encouraged, their evil side showed itself. On this topic, see John Griffin's _Black Like Me_, on the different faces that whites showed to other whites, and to African Americans. <BR>While we are certain that we wouldn't go back to that system, we shouldn't be so sure that we, also, wouldn't be trapped by it if we were born into it. Consider that Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy (to a large extent) didn't take effective action to end segregation.<BR>This book is excellent. Those dreadful and shameful times -- and the vestiges which still continue -- must not be forgotten.	2002-10-08
US	53071138	R2OET2KBIHVHLT	0525243275	887950972	To Bear Any Burden	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Great and significant book	This book is worth reading for anyone interested in the history of the Vietnam War.<br />It is a collection of forty-eight short recollections from a wide variety of Americans and Vietnamese involved in the war, or the country, from the late 50's to the 80's.  It also touches on Cambodia and Laos.  Each recollection is from one-half to six pages long, and may cover one short event, or several years' experience in the country.<br />The book deceptively starts out slowly, and it is only with continued reading that one discovers that within this chosen group of recollections are many of the great truths of politics and military conflict in South Vietnam.<br />The essays cover the fatal flaws inherent within South Vietnam, which include the long history of being a colony of France, without France taking any steps to prepare the country for independence, such as training civil servants or encouraging the rule of law through local rulers.  Once independent, South Vietnam was fragmented on religious lines.  The civil leaders were corrupt, engaged in nepotism, and did not relate well to the peasants.  South Vietnamese military leaders were promoted not on merit, but by family ties and the size of the bribes they paid to the government.  For political reasons, the military zone around Saigon was intentionally unorganized and inefficient.<br />The geography of South Vietnam -- having all its territory within easy reach of Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam -- made it a very difficult land to defend from an enemy with safe sanctuary so close to crucial areas.  This book does not mention the oppressive acts of the South Vietnamese government, which helped alienate its citizens.  The book seems to understand, if not almost excuse, wrongful acts by US soldiers.<br />The US tactics also contributed to defeat:  rules of engagement tied the military's hands in senseless ways (a SAM base couldn't be attacked under construction, but pilots had to wait until it was operational);  rotating inexperienced officers through Vietnam to \\"punch their combat ticket\\" was more important than retaining experienced officers and advisors who often \\"got it\\" just before being rotated out;  the battle for \\"hearts and minds\\" was often ignored;  and years were wasted on ineffective strategy, until home protests compelled withdrawal.<br />And, yes, North Vietnam really was an oppressive regime which used terror and lies to achieve its goals.<br />Any discussion of Vietnam brings up many \\"what if's?\\"  What if South Vietnam had a more appealing and legitimate government?  What if US politicians hadn't used such ineffective strategy and tactics?  Is there ANY scenario which would have resulted in a long-term stable and secure South Vietnam?<br />If you're at all interested in the field, this is a book well worth searching out.	2002-10-05

This is, of course, undesirable in a history book.<BR>Wright, for instance, reports that during the Vietnam war, a TV cameraman pictured an American soldier setting fire to a Vietnamese hut.   Wright identifies this village as My Lai, and the televised hut-burning as the start of the My Lai massacre.  In fact, the televised hut-burning was at Cam Ne in August 1965.  The My Lai massacre happened in March 1968, and wasn't publicly revealed until November 1969.<BR>Wright's mortality figures from the Civil War are equally perplexing.  Most sources, including Wright, say between 3 and 4 million Americans served in the War, on both sides.  If, as Wright says, 600,000 died in the War, that's a mortality rate of between 15 and 20%.  But in the same paragraph, Wright gives a mortality rate of 13.4%.   And later in the book, Wright says 1 of 65 soldiers died in battle, and 1 in 13 died of disease -- which would be a mortality rate of 9.2%.   While Wright doesn't need to solve a mystery that's unsolvable due to incomplete records, he should explain why he gives three different figures for the same event.<BR>Wright says that \\"Amazing Grace\\" was originally a Negro spiritual.  In fact, Amazing Grace started as an English hymn written by former slave-trader John Newton.  Later, the hymn's  music, taken from an American folk song or \\"plantation melody,\\" was added.<BR>Further, Wright's habit of repeating anecdotes from chapter to chapter, almost verbatim, such as John Jones and the \\"Bread Riot,\\" is distracting.<BR>In sum, no matter how interesting and educational most of the anecdotes are, if the information given can't be trusted to be factual, the book should sadly be passed up.  With a bit of editing and fact-checking it would be a good book.	2002-10-02
US	53071138	R1IL0MRIXADT9P	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	1	2	3	N	N	Tedious	My first hopes on reading this book is that Jack Ryan wouldn't be as terrible as he was in _The Bear and the Dragon_. And, in that respect, _Red Rabbit_ is a better book. This book has occasional profanity, but none of the repeated gratuitous gutter profanity and sex of _The Bear and the Dragon_. Nor does this book revel in racial stereotypes and insults.  Women have a largely decent role.  There's less ranting against immorality -- although there are frequent reminders of how holy and pure the Catholic Church is -- \\"its policies rarely, if ever, strayed from love and charity\\" -- which we know isn't true.<BR>There are portents of the future -- this Jack Ryan likes to drink (always 3 drinks) the day before a dangerous action, and when leaving a dangerous action (the exfiltration and the attempt on Pope's life). But this Jack Ryan doesn't get roaring drunk when he's needed, like he'll do later as President. <BR>Clancy hits us over the head with reminders of Jack's bravery in the ULA attack on his home covered in _Patriot Games_ -- there are at least twelve different recaps of that attack in this book! And there are at least seven virtually identical bits of dialogue where we're reminded that Jack was knighted for his actions against the ULA, but doesn't like to be called \\"Sir John.\\"  For some reason Clancy repeatedly clobbers us with the cutesy \\"pshrink\\" spelling -- at first I thought it was a term for psychiatrists specially trained to work with spies, but no, it's just a cutesy spelling you might find in a pre-teen's diary.<BR>There are some puzzling inconsistencies for someone who CAN (or could) write a good book, as Clancy.  If the Russian, Zaitzev, was so concerned about the Pope, why did he insist on waiting until he was brought to the West to reveal that time-critical information? The \\"Operation Mincemeat\\" part of the plot served to hide the fact that Zaitzev had defected, but it greatly increased the risk that his escape would be discovered, and stopped, before Zaitzev was safe in the West. It also seems that the specific identity-hiding pre-burning of the discovered bodies could well be obvious to any doctor who examined the bodies of a \\"KGB employee\\" and his family. Zaitzev's presence in the West is a crucial secret to be closely held, but Ryan needlessly mentions it to his fellow operatives in Rome as a bit of casual conversational filler. <BR>Clancy does a good job fitting his story around historical facts. The writing isn't up to par with the earlier books, but it's good. The \\"techno\\" part is missing, in favor of supposed political analysis, and a bit of tradecraft and gossip. The main distraction, unfortunately, is that we KNOW this Jack Ryan will eventually become a simple-minded jingoistic irresponsible racist President.	2002-10-02
US	53071138	R3SWRR39LO1KOI	0684870266	708330639	A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government	Books	5	18	26	N	N	Excellent book on US history, politics, and dissent	This is a fantastic book.  Wills does a great job in discussing the general theories of the different steps people take when they disagree with government policy or action, with a number of pertinent examples.  Wills is excellent when discussing the beliefs of the American revolutionaries (which, he reminds us, were not revolting but seceding), and how those beliefs led to the Articles of Confederation and Constitution.  Reading this book will enlighten the reader to the archetypal forms of actions taken when people disagree with the government -- information, and even guidelines, that are highly relevant today.  He has particularly interesting insights on Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Second Amendment.<BR>Yet at times Wills goes overboard in proving several of his viewpoints.  A major theme of the book is that Jackson, Webster and Lincoln were not only militarily, but logically and Constitutionally, correct in asserting that the South was wrong to secede.  Wills claims that the South's argument for secession was limited to an assertion of the southern states' rights under their states' prior sovereignty.  He then asserts that since the Union preceded the states, that the states were never sovereign.  <BR>Wills is right that the Constitution gives superior authority to the federal government, but   he omits that colonies of identical name and geography to the succeeding states were there long before the Union, and those colonies formed states which confederated into Articles of Confederation government.  Although the Constitution is written in the name of &quot;We the People,&quot; it was drafted by state delegations to a convention of the states, and ratified by the states, which comprised the resulting Union.  These states' sovereignties is subsumed into the union, which was named the United States -- both the union and the states present.<BR>The South's hypocrisy (in claiming local rights while silencing local dissent), and the execrable reason for itssecession (preserving slavery), do not by themselves refute the argument that the South had grounds to secede.  What if, alternatively, the six New England states got disgusted with the pro-slavery US and seceded to form a new slave-free country for the best of motives?  Would six freedom-loving states choosing to leave a slave-holding country be constitutionally justifiable?  <BR>If the Union had just let the South peaceably go, arguably there would have been trade between the US and Confederacy, and perhaps the Confederacy's internal inconsistencies would have caused it to implode, and/or do away with slavery on its own within a few decades.  This probably would have eliminated the seething and often violent resentment of the post-bellum South to the North, and possibly have led to a peaceable re-union.  Would letting the South go have set such a terrible precedent, since it's unlikely an issue as divisive as slavery would arise and cause later secessions?<BR>While Wills is a great writer and makes many compelling arguments, in some areas his logic falls short.<BR>While making the point that handguns are ineffective when not carefully aimed, as part of a larger debunking of American gun culture, Wills lists as evidence that Samuel Colt designed revolver barrels to remind the user of a finger, and we don't point from belt level, but &quot;with extended arm, our finger at the end of it.&quot;  Yet, really, most pointing is _not_ done with finger at eye level, like an aimed handgun.<BR>Wills also says he can't understand why some motorcyclists protest mandatory helmet laws since they already accept other restrictions, such as obeying stop signs.  Yet those restrictions are of different kinds:  stop signs are for the benefit of all, while helmet use arguably protects only the individual.  This is not to say that motorcyclists shouldn't be compelled to protect themselves, but we should acknowledge the logical distinctions between the two prohibitions.<BR>There's alsoa typo where Wills should have said Thoreau expected to be released from jail even though his fine had _not_ been paid, and Wills misquotes the computer card &quot;do not fold, spindle or mutilate&quot; phrase.<BR>In all, it's a very worthwhile book to read.	2002-09-18

The cover picture depicts a female police officer.<BR><BR>It wasn't until I got to the Afterword at the end of the 263-page book that I discovered that not only are subjects' names false, but the characters are composite characters.  Now, there had been one hidden line at the end of a paragraph in the middle of the five-page Foreword, which I missed, that said the author was preserving the subjects' \\"anonymity,\\" but didn't say that composite characters would be used.

On the one hand, she is so against guns that she demonizes those who are \\"pro-gun.\\" She claims that \\"in the Bureau, at least, few men will admit it\\" but \\"the truth is\\" that law enforcement agents often have an antipathy toward guns and see them as a necessary evil. Among agents, there's an \\"undeniable bad element\\" who see their weapons as manhood organ extensions. She says you won't find many cops and agents \\"out campaigning on behalf of the NRA.\\" In describing her son's attitude toward guns, she finds that his being \\"as opposed to handguns and the NRA as any cop or agent I know\\" is \\"an entirely sane view.\\" If you are pro-NRA, DeLong sees you as wrong, bad, and less than sane.<br />Yet DeLong, in comparing her small size to larger-bodied male agents, quotes herself as saying, \\"You're bigger than me, but I guess you didn't notice that our guns are the same size.\\" When her father gave her a revolver, she \\"felt profoundly honored. It was as if he had bestowed the keys to the world on my generation of women.\\" She says that when she graduated from the FBI Academy, \\"I wore my handbag (gun purse) proudly.\\" On the back cover of the hardback, the author picture emphasizes the gun she is \\"packing.\\"  In other words, she can identify with her guns, but if you own a gun, you're crazy.<br />There are also problems with DeLong's use of statistics. She says that sexual assault murder is most often same-race, white on white 55%, black on black 24%, \\"and so on,\\" with 15% of black offenders targeting white victims. She doesn't footnote her reference source (except \\"DOJ statistics\\"), and doesn't supply the table she was using. The statistics may vary depending on whether she's using the single victim/ single offender tables (as are used in the published statistics _Crime in the US_). DeLong may have preferred to use the 2000 statistics on general murder; relevant to the case she mentioned, if you're a sole white victim, there's an 86% chance your sole killer of known race will be white.<br />She also relates the story of how, in two periods of her life when she thought she needed extra money, she broke a firm FBI rule and moon-lighted as a nurse. At least once, she lied to another agent who saw her in the hospital that she was working undercover. She told other agents she was doing \\"volunteer work\\" as a nurse. Yet she's more concerned with finding out who turned her in, than reflecting on why she violated FBI rules and lied to fellow agents.<br />The book is, generally, interesting. It has many sad passages on how senior agents, at least at first, strongly resisted the idea of women agents and assigned them humiliating tasks. She also reveals that much FBI work involves waiting around the office playing office politics and, yes, eating doughnuts.ere's an 86% chance your sole killer of known race will be white.<BR>She also relates the story of how, in two periods of her life when she thought she needed extra money, she broke a firm FBI rule and moon-lighted as a nurse.

The book is full of anecdotal, and broader, observations of the war effort and those involved in it. <BR>However, Rooney's opinion seems a bit too self-important at times, considering his own personal judgment of a situation or person as the final and authoritative word on the subject. He tends to paint those he meets and hears about as totally \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\"<BR>It could be that, in print, Rooney can't convey the wry \\"just kidding\\" tone he verbally communicates in his TV commentaries. Rooney's inability to convey tone leaves the reader puzzled after reading such truly bizarre Rooney statements as \\"Let me assure you the state of the helicopter art, even the best there is, to this day is primitive. The big Sikorsky, for instance, had that small propeller mounted on the tail.... This small mechanical necessity alone leaves helicopters in the class of Mickey Mouse inventions.\\" <BR>You'll find this an interesting, and somewhat quick, read, but not on your \\"must read\\" list.	2002-04-02

When Jane is telling about having read books on the \\"fringe viewpoints\\" of child-rearing, she makes up silly titles.  Why?  There are real fringe viewpoint child-rearing books out there she could have mentioned.<BR>Jane also brings up her silly belief that \\"true aficionados\\" of BMW cars call them Bimmers instead of Beemers - the ridiculous claim that the pretentious country club set has the right to dictate the \\"correct\\" slang term to the majority of the country.  Language, especially slang, is based on usage.<BR>In her book, the rich are almost always self-righteous, harmful and  hypocritical (or at least shallow), and the non-rich are almost always honest with a heart of gold.   One could even say that Jane's latent goodness is a result of the fact that she was born poor.  This is an unthinking and gratuitous generalization.<BR>Yet Morsi does have some nice turns of phrase.  The belief that those who don't rise to the top don't deserve to is \\"social Darwinism.  Or maybe in Edith's case, socialite Darwinism.\\"  And, of course, \\"no good deed goes unpunished.\\"<BR>There is little examination in the book, even after Jane becomes \\"good,\\" of who God is.  She doesn't examine that the God who sent Chester to rescue her is the same God who allowed her car to be on the road in the path of the semi-truck tanker in the first place.<BR>She waffles back and forth on how far she should go in her gratitude for being saved, and in keeping her promise to do good if she is rescued.  She also constantly wrestles with the uncertainty of how her actions will ultimately affect others:  we may even harm people by \\"helping\\" them.<BR>Jane \\"believed in God, of course.\\"  But that was supposedly evidenced by her husband and her being \\"members of one of the oldest, most influential churches in the city.\\"  She later later she reveals that she's not a member, but simply attended with her husband because \\"joining requires attending workshops and courses.\\"  Regular church attendance by this group of  socialites does not translate into moral behavior.<BR>Once Jane makes the promise \\"to God\\" to do good, she looks to mainly secular philosophers to guide her in what is \\"good.\\"  She's also guided by Maimonides' list of eight levels of charity (Tzedakah).  <BR>She acknowledges the inconsistency of believing in a God who rescues her, but ignores others in similar plights.  \\"If all it took to get out of trouble were some heavenward mutterings, nobody would ever get hurt or die.\\"  And she faces the inconsistency of not really believing in a God who acts on earth, but having prayed to Him as if He did.  Throughout the book she proceeds to \\"do good\\" without any heavenly guidance, yet concludes that the goodness of the universe is either \\"God or the result of God.\\"<BR>The sudden \\"miraculous\\" event of being rescued after her car crash gives Jane a different perspective on her values and priorities.  The same thing can happen through taking a college class in Europe.  The contributions Jane makes are not financially hard - she gives out of her abundance - but they are socially hard for her because they necessitate a sea change in her priorities and relationships.  Like many of us, she never comes to a firm understanding of why the world is the way it is, and why she acts the way she acts.  Her God is like a genie who must be credited with the good in the world, because we are embarrassed to admit that we may be good.<BR>In sum, the book is worth reading.  It's nice to read a book without a serial killer lurking in the shadows, or World War III looming over the next horizon.	2002-03-26

He reveals, for instance, that the apple was not only one of the only sources of sweetness in early America, but that the main use of apples in early America was cider.  Because we have so limited the original diversity of the apple into just a few strains, apples require large amounts of artificially-applied pesticide to fight the continually-adapting apple pests.<BR>He explains not only how the tulip mania in Holland rose and fell, but why the prized feathered or \\"broken\\" tulips were less hardy.<BR>In the discussion on marijuana, Pollan diverges into interesting discussions of the chemistry of human consciousness, how psychoactive plants interact with our consciousness, society's reaction to the use of marijuana, and how strengthened prohibitions against marijuana have ironically led to more potent marijuana.<BR>Talking about the potato, Pollard discusses the dangers of genetically engineered plants - bringing in a pesticide gene from a bacteria to the potato, which results in not only biological dangers, but the danger of putting big business in tight control of agriculture.  Pollard also discusses not only how the Irish potato blight came to be, but why it particularly impacted the Irish.<BR>Woven through all these discussions is the theme of the split human attitude toward nature - admiring its wildness, while attempting to exert maximum control over it.<br />You'll enjoy this book - as you will a similar book (though less esoteric) - _An Empire of Plants:  People and Plants that Changed the World_ by Toby and Will Musgrave, which explores the worlds of tobacco, sugar cane, cotton, tea, poppies, quinine and rubber.	2002-01-15

(In comparison, when John Deutch, former CIA Director, was discovered to have stored very sensitive national security secrets on his internet-connected home computer, which was used by a household member to access pornographic internet sites, nothing was done to him except that he lost his security clearance.)<BR>The book gives plausible reasons that Lee may have downloaded the information, consistent with Lee's character and past actions, which do not involve spying.<BR>This is a very well-written, balanced, and thorough book; I recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the Wen Ho Lee controversy.	2002-01-10

Most TV dramas reinforce the false &quot;Perry Mason&quot; idea that a successful defense attorney must not only show the prosecution has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but ALSO must come up with the truly guilty person, who will confess on the witness stand.  Broadcast and print journalists insist on saying the defendant pled or was found &quot;innocent,&quot; when the correct term is &quot;not guilty.&quot;  (There's a world of difference between &quot;innocent&quot; which means morally blameless, and &quot;not guilty&quot; which means putting the state to its burden of proof.)  The &quot;tough cop&quot; who ignores the inconveniences of the Constitution is as much a hero in fiction, as the &quot;slimy defense attorney&quot; who defends the always-guilty defendant is a villain.  All these might be entertaining, but they create a mindset among jurors who decide real-life guilt.<BR>_Wrongly Convicted_ addresses the hard real-life questions of how things can go so wrong that an innocent person (one who had nothing to do with the crime) can wind up convicted and even executed.<BR>Would an innocent suspect sign a confession?  Yes;  he's coerced into believing it's actually in his interest.<BR>What characteristics of a crime most frequently create a rush to judgment with the conviction of an innocent person?

In books like this, the editor must steer a course between overly-scholarly and overly-popular writing.  The editors have chosen a middle course.  The writing is not so popular that it reads like People Magazine, yet the editors use text with multiple subheadings and just the right amount of quoted material, so that it's very readable.  Each essay is followed by its notes and extensive references.  There is an extensive Index covering the entire book.  The book concludes at a very non-ponderous 280 pages of text.<BR>My only wish is that, in addition to the current book, the editors and authors could produce a high school version, perhaps 40-50 pages of the main points and pertinent examples, suitable to inclusion in a social studies curriculum.	2002-01-02

It has the same foible of all medical mysteries - straining to put the medical hero (here, Joanna) into a position where she is finding clues and interrogating witnesses, which results in an unwieldy plot.  I'm also troubled by the glorification of Neanderthal police tactics.	2001-12-20

The only quibbles I have are that, in the denouement, the guilty party seems a bit too omnipotent and omnipresent, and that the end drama was inserted into the Prologue, and trumpeted on the front art and back cover.  I'd rather read the book wondering what problems are going to happen at the seminar, instead of feeling like I had read the end of the book before going to Chapter 1.<BR><BR>I also wish those who write reviews would read the reviewed book first.  In this instance, the &quot;#1 reviewer&quot; comments that agency owner Wong &quot;has not even shown up at the office in months.  Unless he sells [three key employees] the company, they will quit and start a new company. At least half the present clients of Wright and Wong would come with them.  Wong agrees with the stipulation that the threesome come with him on a retreat first.&quot;  In fact, according to the book, Wong had been gone two weeks at most -- from &quot;the annual holiday bash&quot; to late December.  Wong took 18 weeks a year vacation, not 18 weeks in a row.  The workers calculated that _all_ the company's clients would come with them.  And Wong's stipulation was that the three go on a retreat _without_ Wong, not with him.  Maybe Ms. Klausner, who managed to post _85_ reviews in November 2001, should cut back on her production in favor of accuracy.	2001-12-17

There is endless speculation throughout about whether Wraith killed Christian, and story after story of Ramsland asking psychic after psychic whether she should keep the ring. Almost to a person, they strongly warn her of the dangers of the \\"dark side\\" embodied in the ring, but she keeps it. At the end of the book, she even throws away a decoy ring to make Wraith think she no longer has the ring, which Wraith now wants back. (Of course, disclosing the trickery in the book diminishes its effect somewhat, assuming Wraith can read.) There's never any resolution to this theme: was Christian satisfied that \\"his story was told\\" ?? Did Wraith ever give up his quest for the return of the ring? What REALLY happened between Wraith and Christian?  <BR>An implicit theme is the psychology of the author, and what attracts her so to the ghost of a reputed vampire/murderer, who seemingly haunts her and even threatens her through the book.   The reader will want to say, \\"listen to what everyone is saying, throw away the ring, and give it up.\\"  She criss-crossed the country trying to contact Christian's spirit, but never took the time to see if he ever lived.  This part of the book, especially without resolution, goes on way too long, and makes you wonder what type of person Ramsland is.<BR>There are a variety of other themes in the book. Interspersed through the book are the techniques and equipment used by ghost hunters, with a bit of explanation of what the equipment is supposed to detect. She throws in bits of history of the places she investigates, such as Lizzie Borden's home.  There's even a useful index, and photos showingthe \\"orbs\\" and \\"ectoplasm\\" she describes.<BR>You may do well to read the Epilogue first.  There she addresses the main problem with ghost-hunting -- that the ghost hunters have expectations of what they will see, and view everything through those expectations, rejecting contrary evidence.  Many orbs and ectoplasm may be natural phenomena, such as dust, bugs, or warmed breath.  <BR>She also points out that there's no consistent theory of ghostly appearances or behavior.<BR>Her conclusions are hesitant -- that while there's more to it than the skeptics allow, and many reports by credible people, and further research is warranted, results are influenced by the researcher, even unintentionally.	2001-12-11

The author does a good job of not talking down to the reader, explaining most medical terms as the stories go along. The book is a real quick read -- glad I picked it up at the library. <BR><BR>After the pages of portraying how professional and dedicated flight medical staff are, it was a bit jarring to read about how their week-long annual conferences are \\"really nothing more than drinkfests,\\" and the author thought it was a blast to get so drunk she couldn't sit through a class the next morning.  Let's hope she doesn't need to use the techniques she was too drunk to learn on her next patient!<BR><BR>I also wish the book had given a better view of the author as a person -- sometimes she writes about her feelings, but it comes across as more of a report than insight.	2001-12-06

There are a number of unexplained actions and unresolved plot threads. The person who kills Purcell has probably the least reason of any character to do so. The motivations and actions of Paulie and Leila are unexplained. Did Leila take Purcell's money? If so, what happened to it? Why would Richard's killer throw down his gun, leaving witness Kinsey to report him?<br />Why would the police not conduct the same easy-and-obvious search at Purcell's wife's home, as they did at his ex-wife's home? Is the reader expected to believe that a passing and casual lesbian relationship would provide motivation to kill your sugar daddy husband?  Would Kinsey really take as indisputable truth the speculative newspaper innuendo about the brothers' past? (Surely she knows that what's reported in the papers and what really happened are often quite different.)<br /><br />Finally, why would Kinsey, having found proof of who committed the murder, walk up to the murderer's home and ask to use the phone to call the cops?  There were no other phones in town?<br /><br />There are a few other bloopers too: an insurance company which lost a suit compelling it to pay a death policy could not file another suit to relitigate the same issues; nor would it be proper to ask the applicant's marital status on a commercial lease application in California.<br /><br />Further, of the five Spanish words Grafton uses in the book, she manages to get them ALL wrong. The road called \\"Via Bueno\\" would be \\"Via Buena\\" (no '&iacute;' on street signs), and would mean \\"Good Road\\" instead of \\"Road Good\\" as Grafton writes. Kinsey reports \\"I took Spanish in adult education, but I've forgotten everything except 'ola' [hola] and 'buenos dios.'\\" The phrase is \\"buenos d&iacute;as,\\" not \\"buenos dios.\\"  Grafton's trying to write the common phrase meaning \\"good morning,\\" but the phrase she comes out with means something like \\"good god.\\" Sheesh.<br /><br />Grafton has not taken a plunge as deep as Tom Clancy has with his most recent book. However, sloppy proofreading and poor fact-checking, along with illogical plot development well below her usual standards, suggest that Grafton is intentionally producing a poor product.  This is not \\"requiring readers to use their imaginations\\";  it is assuming that readers will accept any type of unfinished ramblings as a book worth reading.god.\\" Sheesh.<br /><br />Grafton has not taken a plunge as deep as Tom Clancy has with his most recent book.

The interplay of the characters is entertaining and inviting, even the final &quot;Charlie Chan movie&quot; type scene where the characters are brought together and the murderer revealed -- the only thing missing in the book is the lights being turned off and the quick scuffle as the perpetrator tries to escape.  The author uses occasional deft and subtle humor and brings in interesting tidbits from Spinoza.<BR>  The description of the first murder crime scene (paperback page 78) led me to a correct guess of the murderer's identity.<BR>  And strangely for a book where much of the plot turns around the type of glove Bernie wore for the burglary (rubber, with the palm removed), the cover shows Bernie taking the nickel from the safe while wearing a complete leather glove.	2001-11-30

Having additional sources of information (the Abrams tapes) available to him, the author feels compelled to quote from those sources at length.  Wishing to point out who was responsible for a beneficial change in policy in the war, Sorley worships General Abrams and demonizes General Westmoreland.  Wanting to illustrate the unimportance of bombing North Vietnam, he mixes up statistics of Cessna mail flights with those of B-52 raids over Hanoi.  To persuade us that most South Vietnamese civilians were in safe hamlets and that the South Vietnam government was protecting its people, he forgets to tell us that the &quot;safe hamlets&quot; were not the villagers' own home hamlets.<BR>His main point is that moving away from Westmoreland's &quot;search and destroy&quot; tactic to Abram's &quot;clear and hold&quot; tactic brought us to the brink of winning the Vietnam War.  Yet let's not forget that the commanders' actions were often both dictated and limited by American politics:  Westmoreland had Johnson, and Abrams had Nixon.<BR>To what extent was South Vietnam a viable country?  They were much more our &quot;client&quot; than our &quot;ally,&quot; by any measure.  Would pointless activities such as the Thieu/Ky rivalry, and Thieu's continuing support of ineffective generals, have ever resulted in a stable situation, such as we have now in North/South Korea?  Would the North Vietnamese have ever given up?  Would it be politically and physically possible to continually invade Laos, Cambodia, and the DMZ to deny the North Vietnamese their staging and supply areas?  Would we risk scuttling our valuable relationships with Russia and China to coerce Russia and China into abandoning North Vietnam?<BR>If you read this book, keep in mind that it has its limitations, biases, and inaccuracies.  Be sure to read other books, such as  _Our Vietnam/Nuoc Viet Ta: A History of the War 1954-1975_ by A. J. Langguth.	2001-11-25

The first review complains that this &quot;reads like a school book. Ideal for the scholar, maybe less than ideal for the casual reader.&quot;  Well, what did that &quot;casual&quot; reader expect from a book whose cover proclaims that it &quot;fills a huge gap in the historiography of the Vietnam War&quot; ??<BR><BR>  This is NOT a dull or difficult book for anyone interested in the subject.  The facts, figures, and background the authors include are very helpful in understanding what led the several armed forces to come into battlefield contact, and why they acted as they did.  Particularly helpful is the authors' technique of letting participants tell their own stories -- even stories that contradict each other.  The book has a helpful index, and extensive source notes and bibliography for those who wish to read further.<BR><BR>Perhaps the major fault of the book is that the authors detail the terror and coercive tactics of North Vietnamese forces, and the failings of North Vietnamese leadership, while omitting any mention of similar tactics and the failings of the US/South Vietnamese forces (except the inescapable acknowledgment of My Lai).  By this omission, the authors leave the mistaken impression that South Vietnam had a legitimate and widely-supported democratic government with civil rights, whose secret police, ARVN, and US troops never engaged in abuse of the population and enemy prisoners.  The VC/NVA actions should at least have been put in context by mention of the South Vietnamese/USA Phoenix program, corruption, tiger cages, etc.  The reader may wish to also read _Our Vietnam/Nuoc Viet Ta: A History of the War 1954-1975_ by A. J. Langguth to get additional perspective on the failings of the South Vietnamese government.<BR><BR>The authors' limited use of their own feelings about the war, combined with a skillful combination of others' personal narratives and official reports and information, results in a very readable, informative and valuable book.  Particularly moving is the Afterword, which reads in part, &quot;We questioned each other and ourselves about whether we were 'going soft' on the VC/NVA who were dedicated to the deaths of our friends....  Yet, the more we researched and wrote, the more we learned that the majority of the VC/NVA did their duty as they saw it -- not unlike ourselves and our fellow soldiers....<BR>&quot;Slowly, and despite our efforts to do otherwise, we began to feel more kinship with the VC/NVA than we did with many of our fellow [civilian] Americans....  Even more sobering to us was the moment when we finally realized that we had more in common with our former enemies than with the politicians who had sent us to war.&quot;	2001-11-04

The strongest point of this book is that it's a well-written suspenseful page-turner with no visible factual bloopers. With this book, you're guaranteed a day or so of compelling reading. <BR>As the other reviews mention, this book could benefit from more complex characters. Most characters are totally \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" (except for one revelation at the end). <BR>One chilling sentence in light of recent events is the book's prediction on future terrorism: \\"So who's next? Are we going to get a 747 impacting the World Trade Center...?\\" <BR>I agree with the other review that the ending is inconsistent with the book. When the responsible parties are revealed, it is just inconceivable (even with fictional poetic license) that such parties would take the actions they did for the purpose they did. It's also never cleared up how the communications were intercepted (if we believe the \\"I really tried to stop them\\" statement), and it's a bit inconsistent that the \\"bad guys\\" could so convincingly pretend to be FBI agents, down to minute behavior and ID, and yet not know the location of the FBI academy.	2001-11-04

This emphasis on the preeminent racial nature of \\"American\\" identity is somewhat at odds with his other theme that \\"being white meant, above all, not being black.\\"<BR>While the book is subtitled \\"The American Misadventures of Race,\\" the book could benefit from some discussion about the role of race in other civilizations and countries.  What, in other countries, is similar to, or different from, the US experience?  <BR>While Malcomson does a good job in analyzing popular culture's take on race in many cases, this could improve.  There's no mention of the effect of Defoe's 1719 _Robinson Crusoe_ - the first English novel, and full of the racial assumptions of the time (during 28 years on the island pondering why God abandoned him, Crusoe never considers it could be because of his involvement in the slave trade;  nor does Crusoe give second thought to his assumption that Friday will be his servant after leaving the island).  D.W. Griffith's 1915 \\"Birth of a Nation\\" is barelymentioned.<BR>Malcomson's attitude toward religion is inconsistent.  At one point, he tries to argue that religion did not support slavery, writing that pro-slavery advocates \\"desperately ransacked the Bible to find comfort for slaveholders ... [with] harried thumbings of the Bible.\\"  Yet it isn't too hard to find the Bible's tacit approval of slavery, its general comments on separation of peoples, and even direct commands such as \\"Slaves, be obedient to those who are your earthly masters.\\"   Nor does Malcomson mention the approval that many churches gave to slavery, and the typical segregation practiced by churches, which certainly lent legitimacy to feelings of white superiority.  Billy Graham astonished some church members when he refused to allow segregated seating in his crusades after 1954:  in some areas, formalized church segregation continued through the 1960's.<BR>Yet, ignoring the church's segregation through the 1960's, Malcomson suddenly decides the church is segregated in the 1970's.  He writes, \\"When, as a teenager, I left Oakland, I also left the church....  I could not choose to be in a white church.  That would be like choosing a white school (or a white town)....  [In the black church,] the music is undeniably better, there's more to eat at socials, and grief is not treated as a ... character flaw.  Where the white church is a lake, the black church is an ocean.\\"  <BR>First, where is the discussion about _why_ some churches are \\"white\\" ??   There are many reasons besides intended segregation that a church may wind up to be predominately white.  Second, what right does Malcomson have to generalize from his own experience to the idea that the \\"black\\" church is everywhere superior to the \\"white\\" church?<BR>Why does Malcomson think that \\"when I was a teenager\\" is a date every reader should recognize?  (By reading other passages, Malcomson was apparently a teenager in the 1970's.)  In another passage, Malcomson strangely dates an event by the year when\\"Grandma was closing in on death.\\"<BR>Malcomson frequently picks on the negative:  he spends seven pages describing the 1849 California constitutional convention debates on whether to admit free blacks to California, yet he does not give the end vote and its margin, nor any relevant language of the California constitution.<BR>The book, published in 2000, essentially ends its narration of American racial history in the mid 1970's, with the observation that whites then tried to move away from their racial past, as other races moved toward theirs.  <BR>One major current issue on race in America is &quot;reverse discrimination.&quot;   Malcomson doesn't even mention cases such as Baake.  Is it right for blacks to receive benefits based on race?   Malcomson's only comment, somewhat on point, is that \\"races in America have functioned so much as families do, and once you are in the family you receive your part of the inheritance, and the American past becomes your past.\\"   <BR>Earlier Malcomson discusses the attempt of abolitionists in the 1840's to keep blacks from forming black groups or holding black conventions, on the principle of equality.  \\"The beyond-race principle lacked a historical element.  Perhaps that is in the nature of a principle.  But in the case of race in America, it could have strange consequences, because race, being itself historical, resists ahistorical explanation.\\"<BR>Where are the author's thoughts on the solution to our racial problems?   How long must the correction of our \\"family\\" problem continue?  One would hope that someone who had done so much research would have some thoughts, but they're not presented.<BR>This is a worthwhile book to read, because it will make you think.  Yet it has a lot of gaps in it, is overly long in many sections, and its stream-of-consciousness organization (as Salon states) is \\"unorthodox if not downright infuriating.\\"	2001-10-17

It's primarily a political history, documenting the motivations and actions of leaders and those who advised them, and then how those decisions played out on the ground.<BR>One early event from the book is telling:  in May 1962, McNamara was making his first trip to Vietnam for a detailed briefing on the situation, particularly on Communist strength.  There were, in fact, an estimated 40,000 in local Communist battalions and identifiable guerrilla units.  His briefers tightened their criteria, and reduced that to 20,000 - 25,000.  THAT number had to be reduced, and was cut to 17,500.  By the time McNamara arrived in Vietnam, he was told the number was 16,305.  The night before the briefing, the colonel doing the briefing removed one-third of &quot;enemy-controlled areas&quot; from McNamara's briefing map.<BR>This book details not only how our government deceived the public, but also itself -- and goes into the motivations of the South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, and their relations with China, Soviet Union, and the French.<BR><BR>I do not see &quot;lack of analysis&quot; as a fault of this book, as a previous reviewer did.  The book does a great job of presenting what each actor said, wrote, and did -- in plenty of detail so that the reader can think for him/herself.  For instance, Langguth spells out exactly how Jack Kennedy SAID privately that he was planning on pulling out of Vietnam in his second term.  Would that have happened?  Would it have been prevented by Congress, and the need for conservatives' support on domestic issues?  Did Kennedy really mean what he said?  That's all interesting, but it's essentially speculation outside the scope of the book.<BR>I do think the book would have benefited from somehow presenting an overview of the war along with the detailed &quot;novel&quot; approach, which trusts the reader with independent knowledge of the war.  Also,the binding in my library copy was weak.	2001-10-11

Maybe the dad has a trace of goodness in him (wow -- he shows a trace of affection to his children), but most of the book is spent figuring out if someone is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; instead of exploring characters who have a MIX of emotions, motivations, and actions.<BR>Kellerman, or his editor, thankfully did a little bit of research on California, so the book is missing the blatant bloopers, and some of the tediousness, of Monster.<BR>The exact circumstances of Joanne's death come as a bit of a deus ex machina, and the actions of Mate's killer are inconsistent.  (I'd elaborate but that would be a spoiler.)<BR>The previous reviews indicating that several characters in this book seem fixated on the idea of weight gain as an obvious symptom of mental illness and something definitely repulsive are accurate.  Yet, keep in mind that Joanne was a 5'2&quot; woman who started at 110# and gained roughly 100#.

Another reviewer perpetuates this mistake by claiming that \\"many night vision goggles have an infrared setting, like the predator, which does show up as red and yellow and colors besides the monochrome green.\\" <BR>The fact is that the Predator, like any image enhancement night vision device, has a green monochrome viewing screen. Nothing shows up as red. Many IMAGE ENHANCEMENT devices, like the Predator, have infrared illuminators, which cast infrared light of .7 to 1.3 microns (invisible to our eyes), which is REFLECTED off subjects, picked up by the lens (along with ambient light), sent to the image-intensifier tube, and amplified for viewing on the monochrome screen. <BR>There is a second, different, type of night vision device.  THERMAL viewers reveal EMITTED (not reflected) thermal-IR radiation of 3 microns to 30 microns.  Thermal viewer displays may be configured as either a multi-colored thermal image, or a one-color setting.  (This is what you see from police helicopter viewers at night when the cars and suspects appear to \\"glow\\"). Thermal viewers are not the \\"goggles\\" Doherty is writing about. <BR>Neither the Predator, nor any other image enhancement device, has a \\"setting\\" to view thermal radiation. An illuminator (infrared light source) used to increase reflected light is NOT a \\"setting\\" to view thermal radiation, any more than a flashlight is a thermometer. To view thermal radiation, a separate, dedicated, thermal radiation viewer is needed.  Thermal viewers do not use illuminators since they reveal EMITTED light.  <BR>The linguistic coincidence that near infrared light is reflected to image enhancement viewers, and thermal-infrared light is emitted to thermal viewers, should not be confusing to either supposedly-experienced authors or deluded reviewers who claim that others \\"don't know anything.\\"<BR>Satellite phones don't, as the author claims on page 182, work indoors (except through a window). Author Doherty was not writing about the fanciful situation where the character had set up a \\"stationary unit\\" outside the building which relayed the satellite signal to the \\"portable headset.\\" The character was dumbly, and impossibly, trying to get a direct satellite signal from inside a building.<BR>Other mistakes in this hopeless book include, with reference to paperback page number, include --<BR>* p. 59 - a secret military base would not be constructed where the only access is by military helicopters with \\"less than a foot\\" of rotor clearance.<BR>* p. 60 - a CAT scan would (normally) not be used to see if there is brain activity.<BR>* p. 74 - the Space Shuttle cannot service satellites (such as \\"Milstar 4\\") in geosynchronous orbit. Geosynchronous orbit is 22,223 miles up. The Space Shuttle's maximum possible altitude is 600 miles. See the difference?<BR>I'm surprised that a book supposedly by an author with military experience would get so many positive reviews after being riddled with obvious mistakes, even _if_ you accept the virtual reality/ action part of the plot. Such obvious mistakes in the writing of a book scream out, \\"this author doesn't care to take the time to make the plot realistic.\\"	2001-09-13

As an earlier review notes, it _appears_ to be \\"thoroughly researched,\\" but it's full of errors.  Just leafing through the book, with no further research, a number of mistakes jump out.  <BR>Among the mistakes - the authors say \\"the US Air Force\\" dropped the bomb on Hiroshima;  the US Air Force wasn't in existence yet - it was the Army Air Forces that dropped the bomb.  The authors twice say the atomic bomb was \\"tested at Los Alamos\\";  no - the atomic bomb was developed at Los Alamos, but tested 175 miles away near Carrizozo NM.  The authors twice, again, report that Nero was \\"the emperor who fiddled while Rome burned (in 37 AD)\\" - a neat trick, considering the violin wasn't invented for another 1500 years or so.  The authors twice tell us that Tenzing Norkay accompanied Sir Edmund Hillary on Everest;  the name is Norgay.   The authors tell us that Edmund Hillary said he climbed \\"because it's there\\";  it wasn't Hillary, but George Mallory, some 35 years earlier, who gave that response.  <BR> Many of the entries gloss over, or over-simplify, the facts.  For instance, the authors truthfully attribute \\"damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\\" to Admiral Farragut;  however, they don't tell us that the \\"torpedoes\\" of that day were not self-propelled, but what we would call mines.  Whitely's _The Teacher's Calendar_ fills in the missing relevant information.<BR> On historical events such as Martin Luther King's \\"I have a dream\\" speech, Whitely gives more background than these authors.<BR> On other events, such as the seizing of the Amistad, _This Day in History_ is silent, while Whitely's book gives a detailed discussion.<BR> Another example of gloss is the authors' report that Galileo \\"created a telescope so he could observe the heavens.\\"   Galileo certainly improved the telescope, but he didn't invent it.<BR> The unwarranted, even \\"cutesy,\\" conclusions the authors frequently draw hamper the usefulness of this book.  The authors tell us that at Hiroshima \\"we learned that man had no control over the terrible might of the microscopic atom.\\"  In fact, man showed his ability to control atomic forces at Hiroshima, and you can't see atoms through a microscope anyway.<BR>  The authors say that the USSR/Nazi Germany non-aggression pact was \\"the fuse that ignited the Second World War.\\"   Elsewhere the authors tell us that WWII \\"was ignited when Germany invaded Poland.\\"   The statements are contradictory and simplistic.<BR> Of course, the book does have its moments - there are a number of stories which appear to be detailed, correct, and interesting.  Yet these have limited use, since the reader has to verify every part of the story, in view of the authors' frequent errors on other entries.   Am I being too picky?  I don't think so - not with a book which certainly intends to be used as an accurate source of history.   <BR>You might consider this book for the limited use of knowing a few events that happened on each day, accepting that the book's facts may be wrong and its conclusions unmerited.  This book could certainly use some good editing and fact-checking.<BR> A _much_ better book for the classroom, or parent, is Sandy Whiteley's _The Teacher's Calendar:  School Year 2001-2002_.  Not only is Whitely much more accurate, but she includes many more events per day, and frequently more information on each event than these authors do.	2001-07-12
US	53071138	RD9GNZAJGARAA	0312185812	773199279	Fighting Fire	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Superb book	This superb &quot;personal story&quot; chronicles the adventures of Caroline Paul as she applies to, and joins, the SFFD as one of its first women firefighters.  The story is a somewhat quick read, but very well-written, and gives the reader a sense of what it's like to be a firefighter, along with her personal experiences and reflections on her acculturation into what she first thought of as the &quot;racist, sexist, fire department.&quot; <BR> Paul skillfully combines her own story with the stories of others and history into a compelling account.  She doesn't fall into the trap of assigning &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; to people.  She almost always explains the lingo she uses -- waiting, however, til the end to explain what a &quot;full box&quot; call is, and waiting to explain why firefighters (somewhat counter-intuitively) ventilate fires.  At least a few photos would be helpful, too -- at least of the media event where she and her sister persuaded the government to release her animal rights-protestor brother from jail, and of the equipment and techniques she describes.<BR> As a final note, the author photo appears to be of the author, in lipstick and make-up, daubed with a bit of dark smudge, wearing her fire helmet.  Is the photo really meant to represent how she appears at work?	2001-07-09

US	53071138	R1IJGSERMZ92X8	0670891576	624836488	In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Well-written;  the shipwreck in context	This is a well-planned, well-written, well-edited and engaging book chronicling the 1820 sinking of the whaler Essex in the mid-Pacific, and the subsequent 4500-mile survival voyage of some of its crew in three small whaleboats. The maps of the Pacific and route of the ship/boats were very helpful in following the narrative, as were the diagrams of the ship and its rigging, and the notes and index. Philbrick has figured out that many of his readers don't come to the book with a detailed knowledge of where the Marquesas are in relation to Pitcairn Island, or the relative locations of the fore topsail and forecastle. It would have been even more helpful to have all maps and diagrams at the front of the book (as the Essex sail plan and deck plan are).<BR> I appreciate the 238-page length of the book; Philbrick understands that when an author has finished covering the topic, it's OK to stop writing, even if the author hasn't reached the 400-page mark.  I also appreciate how he avoids either demonizing or glorifying the characters in the book.<BR> Along the way, Philbrick takes us into the history and sociology of related topics such as whaling, whalers, Nantucket, and survival through deprivation, to name a few.<BR> Philbrick engaged in exhaustive research, including the existing accounts written by survivors (including an account discovered almost 200 years after the sinking), secondary accounts, and a number of sources on the many topics touched on in the book. Where the accounts differ, this is generally noted by Philbrick, with his evaluation of which account is more believable.<BR> The reader should not be dissuaded by the negative review posted by Mark Shanks below.<BR> Shanks criticizes Philbrick for using \\"extrapolations.\\"  The extrapolations in the book are minimal.  A non-fiction author should label extrapolations, but is it a sin to assume that the Essex butchered whales like every other whaler?  Shanks may be confused because Philbrick uses accounts from those survivor reports which might be thought the author's extrapolation.  For example, the report that the crew &quot;looked at each other with perfect amazement, deprived almost of the power of speech&quot; may sound like an extrapolation, but it's a direct quote from the second mate's account.  A few inconsequential extrapolations does not turn this well-researched factual book into a \\"docudrama.\\"<BR> Strangely, Shanks simultaneously criticizes Philbrick for \\"heavily leaning on personal stories.\\"  How could the Essex survivors _not_ write \\"personal stories\\"?  What, after all, is \\"history\\" but significant personal stories in context?  Unlike \\"Perfect Storm,\\" the Essex sinking had survivors who put their recollections in writing.  Without personal stories, this would be a book on whaling in general, with no mention of the Essex.  <BR> Shanks admits judging a book by the first sentence of its preface, and claims that &quot;competent historians&quot; must write in stilted and dry prose.  If Shanks recoils because Philbrick recounts his father and uncle telling him the Essex story when he was a boy, then Shanks has been too-deeply indoctrinated in the need for a historian to appear \\"detached\\" from a moving account. <BR> Shanks categorizes the 40-page source notes at the end as \\"highly anecdotal and subjective.\\"  Instead, the reader will find that Philbrick's source notes contain a richly annotated discussion of the original sources, how the secondary sources were used, and suggestions for further reading.<BR> If you're looking for a college thesis which is narrowly focused on a minor issue, written in a dry style with five footnotes per paragraph, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an educational and entertaining book, don't miss this one.	2001-06-25

In that sense this is a valuable book.<BR> Yet the book is unnecessarily confusing, in a way that could have been easily corrected, for a book that's intended for a mass market.  The author frequently switches designations for the tanks involved, forcing the reader to keep in mind that a &quot;Sherman&quot; is the same as a &quot;M4,&quot; which we must remember is quite different from the &quot;Mark IV,&quot; sometimes referred to as the &quot;Panther&quot; or &quot;PzKw IV.&quot;<BR> While the physical differences and armor depth of the different parts of the different tanks are explained in text at length, there are _no_ diagrams or photos with legend to explain what the author is referring to.  The author may be safe in assuming the readers know what a turret is, but he also frequently refers to the &quot;glacis plate,&quot; and other tank parts, apparently assuming everyone knows what they are and where they are located.  The author repeatedly refers to the importance of obtaining a wrecked tank's &quot;'W' number,&quot; but feels no need to tell us where it was located.<BR> Likewise, the book contains three hand-drawn maps, not referenced to the text.  More and better maps, better coordinated with the text, would be helpful to those of us not intimately familiar with World War II European geography.  Further, the appendices could have been profitably integrated into the text -- perhaps in the introduction.	2001-06-09

There is an interesting section on Noriega.<BR> Even as a layperson, I saw several errors in the book.  For instance, Robinson writes that &quot;practically every bill in circulation throughout the entire country bears microscopic traces of cocaine.  In other words, practically every bill in circulation has at some point been used in a drug deal.&quot;  The conclusion of the latter sentence is not only unwarranted by untrue.<BR> There is a two-fold reason much of our currency contains traces of cocaine.  First, the chemical structure of cocaine is such that bits of cocaine easily lodge in the microscopic crevices of US currency.  Second, US currency is regularly counted by bank and post office money counting machines, which exert enough pressure on money to strip off some paper fibers and expose the cocaine, distributing it among other bills being counted.  Microscopic cocaine on currency does _not_ mean that the money's been used in a drug deal.<BR> Robinson shows a fundamental misunderstanding of criminal justice when he claims a not guilty plea is equivalent to the suspect's lawyer lying on the suspect's behalf, or countenancing perjury.  Instead, a not guilty plea is simply putting the government to its proof. <BR> The book is definitely interesting and readable, yet the mistakes I've noted and others have pointed out indicate that it's not a trustworthy source of information.	2001-03-16

Roker should realize his subtitle is &quot;Adventures in Fatherhood,&quot; not &quot;Adventures Getting to Fatherhood.&quot;  I happened to read the book from middle to end, then beginning to middle, so I avoided being turned off like others.  Following the second pregnancy is a section on the adoption of his first daughter, with his first wife, follows through page 114.<br /> Then, the real book starts -- the bit about being a father (and being his father's son), not on technically becoming a father.<BR> This is less a book than a series of essays, but they're very good essays!  We go from the times his bus driver father took him to work with him, to the time his third grade daughter was called a racial epithet in school, to that first phone call to his daughter from a boy.<BR> Roker touches on many universal fatherhood experiences, such as the feeling we get when someone sees a father with his children and asks if we're &quot;babysitting.&quot;<BR> One day his daughter and he were inundated with fans at an amusement park.  Roker reports, &quot;The park's head security officer came over and asked me if I wanted some protection.  Hey, I'm no Michael Jackson here.  First of all, I'm still black.&quot;<BR> It's not a deep book, except glancingly, and perhaps we'd be lost if we didn't already know Roker from TV.  But it's well-told.  I recommend it, especially if you can borrow it!	2000-12-24

I've already learned that Tom Clancy occasionally loans his name out to hacks (the Op Center series), and that he &quot;co-authors&quot; uneven and misguided books like _A Study in Command_.  But here, at last, was a real Clancy.<BR> No, it's not, in the true sense of the term. <BR> Technical and grammatical mistakes abound.  On page 505, he not only USES the word &quot;fungible&quot; incorrectly, but he has his character go out of his way to DEFINE it incorrectly.  &quot;Fungible&quot; means &quot;replaceable by a similar item,&quot; such as one boxcar of wheat which can be replaced by another boxcar of wheat.  Clancy incorrectly writes that &quot;fungible&quot; means &quot;re-usable,&quot; such as when a gold ornament is re-melted into a new item.<BR> A Johns Hopkins doctor wrongly advises a pregnant woman she can, without any risk to the fetus, take &quot;two drinks tonight to celebrate.  After that, one or two a week.&quot;<BR> Clancy goes deeper into the repeated use of base sexual profanity, explicit sex, and racial stereotyping.  He closes the book with a sexual reference.  He goes even more rhapsodic with the deification of the &quot;warrior.&quot;<BR> Despite the glory of the warrior, Clancy's President Jack Ryan is disappointing to those who knew Jack before.  President Ryan tends to shoot from the hip in making major policy decisions.  He &quot;borrows&quot; cigarettes like a teenager every chance he gets -- to the point one thinks Clancy is getting paid by the cigarette industry to glorify their product.  President Ryan allows the use of racial slurs in the Oval Office.<BR> Even worse, this President Ryan is irresponsible.  Near the end of the book, at a time of grave danger when presidential leadership may be most needed, Jack not only intentionally places himself in a physically dangerous place, but out of effective contact with the government and people.   He just _has to_ be back with his warrior buddies, and invite them all &quot;to the White House, right now, for some drinks on the house....  'I might be drunk before you get there,' the President thought.  And sure enough, with an international crisis still on-going, Jack calls a buddy and announces &quot;How about you and me drain a bottle of something?&quot; and proceeds to get &quot;about half in the bag by this time, and if the media found out about it, the hell with them....  'That,' Ryan thought, 'calls for another drink.'&quot; <BR> It's one thing for a President to get a little high, and quite another thing to do so intentionally when there's an obvious international crisis to deal with.<BR> The whole tone of this book suggests that Clancy is laughing at his loyal readers.  &quot;Put the name Clancy on the cover, and they'll buy it,&quot; I imagine him smirking.  If Clancy continues this way, he'll discover he's managed to trash his name with the reading public.	2000-10-21

The author also  catches the bizarre aspect of life, where the teacher's innocuous actions  of visiting the bathroom and not immediately telling the police about his  bookbag, together with a few details of his prior life, are suddenly  magnified into proof that he's the bomber.<BR> On the other hand, there's  the tiresome &quot;Muslim bomber&quot; stereotype, and the ending sequence  which is both unbelievable and disappointing.<BR> It's definitely readable  but has significant flaws.	2000-05-26

One explanation refers  to a statute.  How much effort would it have taken for the author to give  the reference -- if not in the text, then in the notes or bibliography?<BR>  On the positive side, there's a wealth of attributed on-the-record comments  by those around Laura Schlessinger, in the present and past, back to  Schlessinger's college days and before.  It's a balanced presentation,  recounting not only the times Schlessinger backstabbed others, but the  times she stood by friends.<BR> What's interesting is what is NOT covered  in this book, which supposedly took 14 months to research and write.   There's no mention of the nude photos of Schlessinger which were posted on  the internet, which she first denied were hers and then sued to censor.   Bane reports that Schlessinger coerced a patient of Schlessinger's into  babysitting her famous son Deryk, but there's no report of the  inconsistency this presents with Schlessinger's public claims that she  never used a babysitter for Deryk.<BR> There is some, but not much,  discussion of the source of Schlessinger's &quot;moral positions&quot;:   &quot;She reacts to callers based upon her own problems, her [own]  childhood ... countertransference... [as when a therapist transfers their  OWN] feelings toward a significant person in their past onto the  patient.&quot;  (p.218)<BR> But Bane provides almost no examples of this.   Bane doesn't mention that Schlessinger, now of the nuclear family, insists  that others essentially mimic her public face:  if you're a single parent,  don't you dare date until your child grows up;  if you're divorced, the  non-custodial parent must visit thechild at the custodial parent's home  ONLY because this helps the child feel the child has a &quot;home&quot; --  this given by Schlessinger who has no degree in psychology, and whose MFCC  license has lapsed, despite the near-unanimous advice of professionals to  the contrary.<BR> There's no example of the many times Schlessinger  contradicts herself on the air, for instance berating a caller for  &quot;seeking easy answers,&quot; while running a radio show purporting to  solve moral dilemmas in free two-minute phone calls.<BR> The Author's  Foreword is especially puzzling:  Bane reports her interview with   Schlessinger's mother (whom Shlessinger hasn't talked with for 14 years),  but agreed to not publish any of the mother's stories.  So instead we are  treated to a strange account of the mother's eyeshadow, the mother's bird,  and the mother's carpet.  What purpose except &quot;look who I met!&quot;  does it serve for Bane to report an interview while noting &quot;I cannot  share her stories&quot; ??	1999-10-05

Jance can be an excellent writer, and Brady's a great character, but the feeling one gets from this book is that Jance had to meet a deadline and just cranked another one out.   &quot;Don't forget to throw in the serial killer, and focus on the macabre  and grisly aspects of the killings and burials.  Throw in some local color,  move the townfolk along.&quot; <BR> Jance starts a number of plot lines  that go nowhere, as Kirkus explains.  She focuses on the .50 caliber rifle,  when the shootings could have been done by any rifle.  She repeatedly  raises the specter of a missing armory, which goes nowhere.  There's no  explanation of why a killer with several large rifles needs to borrow a  deer rifle, or why the killer chooses to flee the area right as Brady  discovers his identity.<BR> Hopefully in future books Jance will avoid the  cliches the Brady series is falling into, particularly the unnecessary  detailing of the killing process.	1999-07-04

Almost EVERYTHING about World War II is twisted, simplified and criticized.<BR> Sometimes he can't remember what he said, and thus  criticizes the U.S. for BOTH sides of an issue.  For instance, he  criticizes US inaction before Pearl Harbor, &quot;The United States had  been observing Nazi anti-Semitism for years without doing a great deal  about it....&quot;  Yet 10 pages later he criticizes the US for supplying  Britain with war materials to fight Germany, &quot;Lend-Lease mostly meant  outright gift:  the British understood that they would never pay for the 30  billion dollars of tanks, planes, guns....&quot;  <BR> And of course  there's no discussion about what the US should have done about Germany's  &quot;anti-Semitism.&quot;  The US itself, especially the State Department,  was anti-Semitic at the time.  Should the US have declared war on Germany  in the late 30's based on what we knew THEN on Germany's persecution of  Jews?  No response at all from Fussell.<BR> He critizes the US for fighting  Japan, &quot;for most Americans, the war was about revenge against the  Japanese....  Revenge is not a rational motive, but it was the main motive  in the American destruction of the Japanese empire.&quot;  Yet Fussell is  silent on alternatives:  should the US have made peace with Japan  immediately after Pearl Harbor, or should we have waited until Midway? <BR>  Fussell also can't make his mind up on American mood during the war.  At  one point he quotes FDR as proclaiming, &quot;These are the times that try  men's souls.  Worry and fear are the twin enemies that attack us.&quot;   But then he turns around and claims, &quot;'high morale' became a  substitute for all sorts of lost valuable things -- the critical spirit,  for example, or even ... happiness itself, which `had disappeared along  with rubber ... to be replaced by the wartime synthetic, high  morale....'&quot; <BR> Fussell does have brief interesting chapters on  reading in wartime, wartime idioms, and rumors.  But these are lost amid  the tortured history and unsupported views of the majority of the book.<BR>  A _much_ better book on much the same topic is Stephen Ambrose's _Citizen  Soldiers : The U.S. Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge  to the  Surrender of Germany, June 7, 1944 to May 7, 1945_.	1999-06-30

Mixed in with these are the author's own experiences -- as a neighborhood boy visiting the campus, and as a coddled medical columnist who was allowed to audit the med school's fundamental gross anatomy class, and whose every ail is treated by the country's leading Harvard doctors.<BR> After reading the book you'll know more about Harvard Med, but you'll probably see your doctor for dizziness.	1999-06-30

Rae was used to this....  An advantage -- she  now understood.  Being different had taught her to be tough, resouceful,  and self-reliant.&quot;  Yet none of the book seems tied to her experience  as a minority.<BR>And a mere TWO pages later, the author makes prejudiced  and bigoted comments about nurses as a group:  &quot;[Married Dr. Marco  Donavelli] was called Il Magnifico ... because of his reputation with the  nurses.  No one hopped in and out of bed with more of them than Marco did.   It was not just his looks....

This book provides one of the best presentations of the evidence FOR  OJ -- what EXACTLY was unreliable about the prosecution's evidence -- and  it's not just speculation!  The part after page 250 (hardback version) is  the more worthwhile than the first exhaustive account of OJ's activities  after the murders, before his arrest.<BR> That said, a lot of the book is  consumed with repetitive themes.  There's a lot more trees than forest;   you'll need an overall understanding of the case to &quot;get&quot; this  verbose book.  And some of the easily-available trees are missing from the  book -- it's largely devoid of what the prosecution argued.<BR> Toobin's  book is still the best book.<BR> This book is so objective it fails to  provide a conclusion.  What IS the so-called &quot;American Tragedy&quot;  ??  Is it the murders themselves?  (Not likely -- there are many murders in  the country.)  Is it that a guilty man got off?  Or that an innocent man  was persecuted?  The author declines to say.  The author does repeatedly  bring forth OJ's talent for self-delusion about OJ's OTHER acts toward  Nicole, and OJ's skill at deflecting objective inquiries -- leaving open  the possibility that OJ actually committed the murders, but OJ himself  believes he didn't.  OJ was telling his children that he wasn't under  arrest, but helping the police find the real killer.  As said in other  books, it IS possible to &quot;frame a guilty man.&quot;	1999-05-10

The author writes about his father, &quot;My father wore the [division Screaming Eagle  shoulder patch in WWII....]  [O]nly the Screaming Eagle is engraved on his  headstone, as it had been on his heart.  I'd worn it in the jungle where it  seemed a talisman and inspiration.&quot;<BR> He goes on to describe  incidents like one battalion commander publicly promising to his unit's  families, &quot;I'm going to bring every guy back alive ... every one of  your husbands ... will come back alive.&quot;  Is this a war or a camping  trip?  The schmaltz continues after the war as five division deaths are  lamented.  &quot;Five from the ill-fated crew had settled all accounts on  this earth....  We had been so fearful there would be many, many more.  We  had to be grateful....  But it was a guilty gratitude.&quot;<BR> More  serious problems in this long 440-page book include failing to put events  in perspective.  The author brings in many anecdotes, often in the form of  lengthy quotes from soldiers he interviewed for the book, without letting  the reader in on the secret of what this soldier's role was, what the unit  was doing, why the unit was doing it, etc.<BR> Not only is the author's  writing style disjointed, but the author cannot get his tenses straight.   He usually writes of these past events in the past tense, but then lapses  into current tense, and even into future tense on occasion.<BR> I enjoy the  genre, but this particular book is a definite pass.	1999-05-08

The character of Kim, and her search for self-confidence and family history, is particularly well-developed.  Likewise the Salem  witch trial history bit is well-done.<br /> However, large parts of the book  are rather poorly-done and/or over-done.  The extensive plot line about the  night creatures who, for a start, kill Edward's dog is just incredible.   The evidence of these creatures' identity is all around the researchers and  they unbelievably ignore it.  Cook uses these creatures to turn a workable  and enjoyable medical suspense plot into an over-done gothic novel.<br /> Cook  also incorrectly casts Prozac and other depression-lifting drugs as  personality-changing drugs.  The end scene of the medical research facility  is unbelievable, and the reader is likewise disappointed with Kim at the  end -- she's spent the novel finding her own strength and independence, and  she winds up happy mainly because she's with a man.	1999-03-13

Among the faults are announcing the death of Arthur  Bowman on page 3 and then &quot;flashing back&quot; for the next 250 pages  until Arthur Bowman finally dies on page 254.  Too much of the book is  spent with the reader KNOWING that Arthur Bowman dies, and even WHERE he  dies, and just waiting for it to happen.<BR> The female characters in the  book are superfluous -- they're either in the book as decorations or a  cheering section.<BR> Lastly, for all the research has done, and real-life  experience the author obviously has on the subject, it's jarring to see the  author describe a CIA bulletin board reminding agents to &quot;get their  malaria shots.&quot;  There's no such thing as a &quot;malaria shot.&quot;	1999-01-21

This well-written book is easy to read and well worth reading from several  aspects.<BR> First, of course, is the detailed and highly anecdotal  recounting of what it was like to be a front-line American soldier in  Europe during WWII, while reminding the reader that the only way to truly  know what it was like is to have actually been there.<BR> He goes beyond  this with cogent accounts of the soldiers' training, leadership, tactics  and strategy -- how each battle and campaign fit into the big picture.  He  gives praise and criticism where he feels it is due -- sometimes both to  the same person (Patton and Montgomery, for examples).  Ambrose always  explains his reasoning -- WHY something was right, or wrong.<BR> The  interested reader can draw lessons in management from the many accounts of  effective and ineffective leadership. <BR> Sadly, Ambrose recounts  everything that was ineffective about the &quot;Replacement Depot&quot;  system of putting poorly-trained soldiers into combat &quot;cold&quot; on  an individual basis.  Yet this is what the Army did in Vietnam also.<BR>  Through the individual, Ambrose also steps back and looks at societies as a  whole.  Americans came as liberators of Europe, but African American U.S.  soldiers back home could not eat in public diners, while captured German  POWS could.<BR> As another reviewer notes, while the jacket blurb says  &quot;Ambrose shows that free men fight better than slaves,&quot; that is  NOT the point of this book -- and is not something Ambrose argues.<BR>  Ambrose's conclusion:  In the words of a GI, &quot;We were miserable and  cold and exhausted most of the time, we were all scared to death....  But  we were young and strong then, possessed of the marvelous resilience of  youth, and for all the misery and fear and the hating every moment of it  the war was a great, if always terrifying, adventure.  Not a man among us  would want to go through it again, but we are all proud of having been so  severely tested and found adequate....&quot;	1998-10-14

Volkman is not only easy to read, but also does a great job  presenting the facts of the case, the milieu of each case, and how each  case affected history.

He includes some photographs and a  helpful index.  He often throws in details I don't remember seeing in other  more detailed and lengthy works.<BR> Some of the cases Volkman writes about  are the &quot;Trust&quot; operation (early Soviet sting of anti-Soviets),  Cuban doubling of US agents, British doubling of Nazi agents (Double  Cross), code-breaking, atomic bomb secrets, the Wallenbergs in WWII, WWI  German sabotage in U.S., the Angleton/Philby mole affair, etc.<BR>Volkman  is both willing and able to point out each country's successes and failures  -- even when success is based on happenstance and failure is based on  incredibly poor judgment.<BR> Here's one passage:  &quot;[in 1978], Hu  Simeng worked for the Chinese, who did not know that she also worked for  the East Germans, who did not know that she was a Chinese asset, but who  did know that she worked for the CIA, which didn't know she also worked for  both the Chinese and the East Germans.  The material she provided the  Chinese was in fact East German and KGB disinformation, but the Chinese  knew that, so they provided disinformation for Hu Simeng to give to the  East Germans....&quot;<BR> Criticisms include that he occasionally reaches  too facile a conclusion (Wallenberg was killed by Soviets in 1947 instead  of the lengthy imprisonment other sources describe), and at least one minor  factual error (the bomb &quot;Fat Man&quot; was dropped on Nagasaki, not  Hiroshima).<br /> In sum, an excellent book for anyone mildly interested in  the topic, or very interested.	1998-10-01

He writes that he forbids inappropriate humor (\\"it is my belief that every set of remains deserves a certain minimum of respect\\"), but includes a picture of himself drinking a soda while lying next to and working on a body.<BR> His writing goes from clear and inspired to confusing. He can write, \\"the show 'Quincy' has caused me no end of vexation and amusement.... Quincy solved his cases within hours or days. If Quincy had a problem, he telephoned ... Sam, back at the lab, and Sam had the answer for him in seconds.\\"<BR> In writing about his student days, he says, \\"When you have seen bodies burned to cinders in fires, or pummeled to jelly under a truckload of bricks, ... then the bumps and bogies of academic life hold few terrors for you. 'It could be worse,' you tell yourself ... when worse is the thing you saw lying dead in a highway culvert scarcely twelve hours earlier.\\"<BR> He occasionally gets quite \\"poetic\\" in describing humanity, such as the plight of the elderly in his state of Florida: \\"Mom and Pop ... decide it is time to retire ... in sunny Florida. They little realize what pain awaits them! A year or two after moving into the trailer or condominium, Pop suffers a heart attack and Mom is left alone.... Every living soul the survivor knows is back home in the Midwest. To return or stay? Somehow going back seems harder than going forward. The survivor hangs on in Florida, but the sands of time are ebbing away. Gradually there is a sinking, a submersion into a sea of strangers. The long, sunny days become painful and tedious; all seems overbright and irritating in these hot latitudes. Suicide becomes a soothing way out of a painful, empty existence.\\"<BR> But elsewhere the writing can be confusing, as in \\"skin can ... deliquesce during decomposition.\\"	1998-08-01

Fisher's starry-eyed view of the FBI lab has been disproven by recent revelations in the press and in books such as John Kelly's _Tainting Evidence_.<BR> This book does provide an interesting and readable account of the different techniques used by the FBI to analyze evidence, including many accounts of how those techniques solved real cases.  On the plus side, the book is very well-organized, with each chapter covering a separate area of the lab -- chemistry, explosives, fingerprint, document, etc.  The book includes a helpful index.<BR> On the negative side, there is not one drawing or picture in the whole book.  These would have been very helpful in visualizing the instruments, techniques and results Fisher describes.	1998-07-23

Everest Disaster	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Well-written, moving book	The book details events on Everest that bring into question the nature of our  responsiblity to our fellows.  As one climber puts his opinion, &quot;above 8,000 meters is not a place where people can afford morality.&quot;  And yet other climbers and expeditions selflessly helped those in need, at risk to themselves and their own attempt to reach the summit.   The IMAX film team, for instance, gave away spare batteries and half their oxygen -- which had been laboriously carried up the mountain, and the lack of which risked the successful finish of the $5 million IMAX film -- to help the stricken expeditions.  <BR>In another way, the book is like _The Guns of August_ which recounts the unfortunate coincidences and poor judgment which, combined, led to World War I.<BR> The book details the obstacles and conditions all Everest climbers face, and the many different factors on this trip that led to 12 deaths.  Did having a journalist on one expedition, and a prominent socialite on another, cause the respective leaders to take risks they would not otherwise have allowed?  &quot;Above 26,000 feet, ... the line between appropriate zeal and reckless summit fever becomes grievously thin.&quot; <BR>The author also goes into the mystique and motivations of mountain climbing, and particularly climbing Everest itself, and he does not neglect the Sherpas and their history, motivation, life, culture and contributions.<BR> And lastly, the author is brave enough to include at the end some scathing personal criticism he received after the Outside Magazine article.<BR> The shortcomings of the book include a jumbling of the characters' names -- it is a large &quot;cast,&quot; but the author makes it harder by switching back and forth between first and last names.  For instance, the reader must remember that &quot;Anatoli&quot; and &quot;Boukreev&quot; and &quot;the Russian&quot; are the same person. <BR> I think Krakauer's worst offense is to REPEAT the horrific mistake in the magazinearticle.  Krakauer writes that jus! t above the highest camp, closest to the summit, Krakauer saw Andy Harris walking toward and reaching the safety of the tents (which good news was radioed to Harris' loved ones), and then later reported that since Andy Harris didn't reach the tents, the crampon tracks at the same elevation leading into a 7000' abyss must be Harris'.  This was printed in the Outside article, and grieved Harris' loved ones that he died in that way.  In fact, Harris had disappeared much farther up the mountain.  The person Krakauer thought was Harris was someone else.  It was a mistake once, because Krakauer hadn't interviewed everyone -- but to recount the false story again in the book and &quot;correct&quot; it 33 pages later was pointless and confusing.	1998-06-29

This is a fantastic book for anyone who enjoys reading medical fiction or lay medical fact, or enjoys watching E.R. and other medical shows.<BR> In this book, 40 nurses tell you, in their words, what nursing means to them, in the context of first-person narratives of events in their daily job experience.<BR> These stories are, in turn, moving, funny, and shocking -- and always fascinating.  You will &quot;be there&quot; as nurses care for the dying with relatives in denial, or on the psych ward, and the burn ward.  You will see how precious, and occasionally cheap, life is considered in Labor and Delivery, and go along as nurses provide home care for those in poverty and former Hollywood stars.  You will see the Oklahoma City bombing from a nurse's perspective, and spend a long day on a Hollywood set as a set nurse.  You will even travel with a nurse to a clinic in a small village in Papua New Guinea.<BR> In this book, there are several stories focusing on the decision of how to care for the dying -- especially those whose prognosis is probable but not certain.  As we look at each instance of care-giving, we see how some in the medical profession have -- and do -- discriminate on the basis of race and income.  We see how, for every patient, hospitals and insurance companies skimp on care to increase profits.<BR> Each patient comes in, not with mere symptoms, but  with a personality, dreams, fears, background, and family.  Through the intimate act of nursing, each patient touches the nurse's life, and the nurse touches each patient's life.  Ms. Heron says, &quot;What nurses witness and get involved with on a daily basis -- death, birth, extreme despair, suffering, life-altering trauma, extreme joy, rage, disease -- are phenomena most 'normal' people experience only a few times during an entire lifetime.&quot;<BR> This book will entertain you, move you, and shock you.  And you will leave with a better understanding of what it means to be a nurse.	1998-05-27

This well-written book covers, in narrative style, with humor, a recent 52-day field research expedition by the author to the Tanzanian Serengeti and Ngorogoro Crater to study lions, and to Gombe (of Goodall fame) to study chimps and baboons. In frequent flashbacks he reviews his past field expeditions and what they discovered -- new theories about why lions, chimps and baboons form the type of social structures they do. He also covers the struggles and hopes of the wildlife parks, and the difficulty of trying to reconcile the needs, wants, and contributions of: the researchers, the people living in the area, the government, the tourists, the poachers, and the foreign hunters -- all on the limited funds available.<BR> He throws in a lot of information on the species he studies, and builds this information into a theory about how all species -- perhaps even man -- are motivated to either cooperate or compete with each other. Packer also includes his commentaries and anecdotes about his fellow researchers, camp employees, local residents, local and national government officials, and the history of the area.<BR> Packer does an especially thorough job of analyzing how the species' survival is affected by men, disease, inbreeding, other species, and their own species' behavior patterns.<BR> The liner notes include recommendations of this book from the renowned George Schaller and Cynthia Moss. The reviews here by Booklist and Kirkus are accurate.<BR> That said, I do have some minor quibbles with the book. There is no index, and the table of contents is only chronological according to the \\"diary\\" format of the book. If the reader wants to review the material -- however excellent -- on lion infanticide or chimpanzee wars, the reader has to leaf through the entire book to find it.<BR> Likewise, there is no list of suggested further reading or sources, and no glossary. While Packer does define the Swahili terms he uses, he does so ONCE, in text. When one reads that \\"Tony Sinclair is the real mzee\\" on page 244, one has to remember the definition from page 52 [mzee is literally \\"old man\\" -- a term of honor and respect].<BR> Packard also seems to dwell on the negative and random man-on-man violence -- for instance, a lengthy report on the 1975 kidnapping of four researchers from Gombe by Zairian rebels, camp thieves, and assaults on tourists. Grouping these incidents occurring over 20 years in one narrative makes them seem more pervasive than they are.<BR> This is an EXCELLENT book for anyone interested in African wildlife or animal behavior in general.	1998-05-03

He could decide to regurgitate at length the already-known history of 20th Century Europe.    Or the author could limit his discussion to the battles themselves and not place them in context.  Or he could use selective hindsight to point out _in hindsight_ the NOW-&quot;obvious&quot; clues that were missed then.  For instance, while there were certainly some indications that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor, there were much stronger indications that Japan would attack elsewhere, and even that Japan would do anything to avoid war with the United States.<BR> Kirkpatrick avoids all the temptations to turn his book into something too broad, too narrow, or not taking into account the entire picture presented to policy-makers at the time.<BR> What Kirkpatrick does is an excellent job of putting us &quot;at the scene,&quot; on BOTH sides of each battle.  He points out what intelligence was available to each government relating to these incidents, and how it was used, or misused.  He tells us what led to these misperceptions, how the mistaken resulting actions affected the rest of the War, and what might have been done differently with a better use of intelligence.  Along the way Kirkpatrick places each action itself into the context of the War and politics.  He writes about how stubborn or deluded personalities acted in spite of available information, and the persistent habit of many to overestimate their own capabilities and underestimate the other side's capabilities, together with a sometimes fatal view of the other side's intentions, motivations, and psyche.  For instance, the Japanese thought that the attack on Pearl Harbor might well bring about a peace agreement with the U.S.<BR> I have two minor quibbles with the book -- Kirkpatrick doesn't mention that Germany had captured and was using each Allied agent inside Holland for their own purposes for two years (see Ganier-Raymond's _The Tangled Web_), and he mistakenly assumes there were NO Allied agents inside the borders of Germany itself during the war (see Persico's _Piercing the Reich_).<BR> This is a great book, well worth reading.	1998-02-24

The local people say, &quot;It is our turn for environmental development....  You take food from our children's mouths.  You're trying to stop us from improving our condition.  You are no different from those who tried to kill us with their guns.&quot;<BR> Werbach mentions, &quot;I learned an important lesson on the trip.  Environmentalists, in a rush to save the natural world, often forget to consider the implications of their actions.  Our dedication leads to a self-righteousness that bowls over friends as well as enemies.&quot;<BR> Yet his book title, and apparently his philosophy, remains, Act Now, Apologize Later.	1998-02-19

The twist is that when her husband died, the doctor mistakenly recorded the cause as emphysema, not poison.  Because of the mistaken diagnosis of the cause of her husband's death, the widow/ murderer would only have gotten $31,000 insurance, instead of the $176,000 insurance she would have gotten if his death was accidental poisoning.  She wanted the extra money badly enough that not only did she call the doctor several times to ask him if he could have been mistaken, but she called the police to ask if her husband's death could be related to a local cyanide/Excedrin death (caused by her planted Excedrin in a drug store causing an innocent death). <BR>    Investigating as she requested, not only did the police prove that her husband was poisoned, but the police proved that she was the one who did the poisoning, earning her a 90-year prison sentence.	1998-02-19

Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.&quot; <br /> That promise is never delivered on.  The writing style is merely passable.  After a few false starts, the book goes into a very long digression into German and Nazi history which has nothing to do with the book topic. <br /> The author constantly belittles Churchill as the self-indulgent imperialistic &quot;old bulldog,&quot; &quot;that damned warmonger at 10 Downing Street.&quot;   Yet while the author once calls Hitler a &quot;demon,&quot; Hitler is virtually praised as the misunderstood hope of a unified Germany, a man who by May 1941 had reached as far geographically as he wanted -- a man who only bombed London in an attempt to reach peace with England, and who was willing to give up France if England would only agree to peace.  The holocaust?  Why, blame that on Churchill -- the holocaust was started when Germany was tricked into invading Russia.<br /> Why did Hitler invade Russia?  The author can't make up his mind.  Sometimes the reason for the Russian invasion is to convince England that Hitler's desire for peace with England is sincere, and other times Hitler was tricked into invading Russian because there was ALREADY a de facto peace treaty between Germany and England reached in May 1941.  Somehow thrown into the mix is that by reaching peace with Germany and encouraging Hitler's invasion of Russia, this would force the U.S. to come into the war.<br /> Whether Hess' flight into Scotland to meet the supposed leader of the British &quot;Peace Party&quot; came out of Hess' deluded mind, or was a secret mission from Hitler, that surely doesn't translate into either a &quot;secret peace&quot; or an intention on Churchill's part to cause Hitler to invade Russia.	1998-02-19

It does well at portraying daily life in wartime London, and some of the characters have depth and complexity.  <BR> Yet all this effort at realism and character development falls short.  Many people who read this book KNOW the true story of how the Allies turned the German agents in England, and the various complex and ingenious methods which deceived Germany about the planned landing point of D-Day.<BR> And such readers KNOW that the British would not be so dumb and reckless with thousands of lives, as to give the Germans information pointing to Normandy, merely because that information MIGHT cause dissension among German intelligence analysts which MIGHT benefit the Allies.<BR> Nor would the type of risky and pointless manipulation WITHIN the British MI5, which is part of the book's plot, be engineered by MI5, just because it MIGHT make fake information received by the Germans look more authentic -- just as it might allow the Germans to get the true information and cause D-Day to fail.<BR> There are so many plot lines, with equal drama and tension, that could have been developed within the framework of known facts, that it seems silly for an author to go so far outside the known facts.	1998-02-19

Or life on Air Force One?  Or administration-press relations?  Perhaps contingency plans for responding to nuclear attack?  Maybe Secret Service tactics and resources?  You never know what may turn up on the next disorganized page.<br /> He dwells at length on the sexual escapades of the Presidents, crediting almost every rumor as true (somehow exempting Bush).<br /> There is some good discussion about White House budgets, and how the grandeur and privileges of the White House affect governmental decision-making.  One particularly interesting passage is on how White House chefs refused to follow presidential orders to stop serving heavy French cooking and serve lighter American food.  &quot;When they wanted a lighter meal, [the chef] said he was going to teach them how to dine.&quot;<br /> What really brands this book as glorified gossip-mongering is the very lengthy digression into Clinton's supposed sexual wanderings with Flowers and others _as governor of Arkansas_.	1997-12-22

In a sub-chapter titled, &quot;An Unattainable Alternative,&quot; Garry goes on and on about the superiority of Japanese society, where in his opinion bliss is achieved by thinking alike, dressing alike, acting alike, and being so influenced by peer pressure that you give no thought to self-expression or &quot;rights.&quot; <br />Garry uses about 300 footnotes, but 95+% of those citations are to current newspaper articles.  <br />Although Garry changes themes and ideas every few pages, one recurrent theme is that Americans exercise their &quot;rights&quot; too much.  That's all we think about.  Another affect of the litigation explosion.  (Those darn revolutionaries.  Why couldn't we have been like Canada?) <br /> Although Garry has the paper credentials where you would think he could write a REAL book on how litigation affects American culture, this is not that book.  It's written in a &quot;Chicken Little&quot; style to an audience that considers &quot;Hard Copy&quot; an intellectual exercise.  (yes, he refers to Hard Copy too!)  <br />Here's a typical argument and &quot;fact&quot; from the book.  Garry's fickle mind drifts to the claim that parties in a divorce litigate over picky issues -- like who should have the kids.  (Imagine that.)   Now, you might expect some discussion of divorce rates.  Or whether no-fault is better than the fault system.  Or at least what Garry proposes people do if he were made king and disallowed divorces.  But no, the &quot;fact&quot; that Garry uses to support his idea that couples in America, generally, litigate over such picky issues, is that Marcia Clark's husband filed a motion for custody because she was consistently working late on the Simpson trial.  <br />If the type of person who believes everything that's written down didn't believe these unsupported conclusions, the book would even be funny.	1997-11-21

The reader of this book would come away with the impression that the only function of nurses in hospitals is to hand surgical instruments to the surgeon in the O.R. -- especially sad since this is supposed to be a guide to OTHER AUTHORS for them write realistic fiction.  For example, when Doctor Page is discussing how suspected belly wounds are monitored during their hospital stay, he says,   &quot;The trauma surgeon will return to the bedside over and over to reevaluate the patient until he is certain no injury exists.&quot;   Not hardly!  In real life, it's the nurses who provide the hour-by-hour patient care and monitoring.<br /> The prospective author who is interested in a realistic view of what goes on in an emergency room and other hospital settings would do well to read any book by Echo Heron, RN, including the factual Intensive Care, or Condition Critical, or Mercy (the latter is a medical novel).	1997-11-02
US	53071138	R3FTNEKQVLD9IF	0380975327	436741117	Flying Blind, Flying Safe	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Interesting info, but Very poorly organized	This book has lots of info on flying and safety -- as one would hope from the former Inspector General of the Dept of Transportation -- but it's very poorly organized.  Her gripes about petty bureaucracy are intermingled with stories about how she learned to fly which are tangled with stories of herself as a commercial passenger, and somewhere almost lost in there is the information about the deficiencies in the equipment and operations used in commercial air travel.  In the chapter on safe landings, for example, she slaloms into gripes about FAA managers misusing free air tickets.  Toward the end, she advises passengers on which &quot;Airline Safety Rule&quot; to cite, but no mention of where these are found in the Code of Fed Regs or statutes.   What we basically have here is a good first draft of a book that needs to be strongly edited (organized) into something readable -- something that can be referred to without thumbing through 357 pages.	1997-11-01

He talks about the good and bad, the brotherhood and the racism, the brave and the cowards, the committed and the ticket-punchers, the soldiers desiring to help the people and those who hated and abused the people.  He eloquently talks about his torn emotions -- his desire to put in an 'honest tour of duty' and support his platoon vs. his desire to get a job in the rear to protect what he sees as his declining remaining luck.       More than anything, you feel as if you were there with him, and can understand what it was like to be a tank crewman in Vietnam '67 and '68 -- while making it very clear that if you WEREN'T there, you CAN'T understand.	1997-10-18
US	53071138	R1ZHWMD2UH2TOV	0670870897	615847506	Without a Doubt	Books	2	3	8	N	N	Shallow and over-blown book	Despite its almost-500-pages length, this book is a very quick read for anyone familiar with the Simpson trial. And you better already be familiar with the trial before reading this book, because the book focuses on the trees and largely misses the forest. The world revolves around Marcia, and Marcia's always right.<br />The book contains plain misrepresentations of fact -- such as the time Clark told the court that she \\"needed to be home to care for her children.\\" In fact, she WANTED to be the one to drive them to her husband's home that night, but her husband could just as easily have picked them up at her house. What that misrepresentation got the prosecution was an extra weekend to prepare for Rosa Lopez' testimony.<br />How did Clark first fix on the fact of O.J.'s guilt? \\"I had prosecuted literally thousands of defendants. I could feel a clench in my gut when I realized we had the right man.... That familiar twist in my stomach confirmed it.\\" Apparently she still doesn't see that the technical facts the prosecutors put in front of the jury don't matter if the evidence was presented in such a way that the jury didn't understand that the prosecution team had made \\"a point.\\" Nor does she \\"get\\" that Furhman was sank, in large part, because she didn't object to Bailey's misleading questions on Fuhrman's cross-examination, where Bailey flipped back and forth between asking Furhman if Fuhrman had \\"addressed\\" anyone with the n-word, or if Furhman had ever \\"used\\" the n-word -- two very different things.<br />She proudly describes herself as the \\"lead prosecutor,\\" but when mistakes in the investigation and presentation of evidence come up, they aren't HER responsibility -- it's always someone else's fault.<br />She doesn't see that although her experience in the trial was intense, it wasn't unique. Many of her readers have also gone through similar experiences. For example, she says, \\"Fact of the matter is, Chris Darden and I were closer than lovers. And unless you've been through what we went through, you can't possibly know what that means.\\" (p. 374) Perhaps she really thinks no one else has felt an emotional tug toward a co-worker during an intensive project, but that frankly shows her lack of perspective on reality.<br />Better books on O.J. include Toobin's The Run of His Life, and Bosco's A Problem of Evidence.	1997-10-12

Simpson	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent book	This author brings the unique perspective of an educated author who attended the trial EVERY DAY, but was not a participant.   He brings out lots of tidbits from the trial, and lots of evidence that suggests O.J. did not do it -- while acknowledging the blood evidence that O.J. did it.  I only regret that Bosco does not plainly give us HIS ultimate opinion on whether O.J. did it.	1997-10-12

Darden actually believes his race had nothing to do with his being put on the prosecution team, and that the prosecutors put on a good case.  He does offer one insight about an early hearing where Darden let his emotions get hot in one early hearing:  &quot;When the hearing was over, I gathered my things and walked toward the clerk, still in a bit of a funk.      &quot;I heard a voice, but I couldn't tell at first who was talking to me. I looked down at the table and realized O.J. Simpson was talking under his breath to me.  `Man,' he said flatly, `you need to learn to control your temper.'&quot;	1997-02-10

Simpson Trial Prosecutor Reveals What Really Happened	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Doesn't live up to its title!	&quot;The Prosecution Responds&quot; is not about the prosecution &quot;responding&quot; to OJ's defense (as if the defense had something to prove anyway), but this book written by the assistant prosecutor in charge of scientific evidence is limited to HIS own knowledge of and dealings with the case.   Instead of providing a narrative of the facts and trial, Goldberg tells us &quot;how the trial affected me.&quot;  It isn't until the middle of the book that he even mentions that OJ's blood was found at Nicole's townhome!!  Further, his attitude is &quot;the prosecution did nothing wrong.&quot;  Once you read this book, you'll know that OJ did it, and ALSO that the prosecution blew the case by trying to prove things it didn't have to prove (such as &quot;OJ's a bad guy&quot;). A MUCH better book on OJ's trial is Jeffrey Toobin's THE RUN OF HIS LIFE: THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON.	1997-01-09
