A classic story of a blossoming relationship playing out against an old lover's triangle.  I found the relationship between the sheriff and Liesel to be much more interesting than the two brothers fighting over an underachieving woman like two little children fight over a toy.  Unfortunately, the book focuses more on the trailer-park antics of drunken, drug using convict brothers rather than the sheriff and his new found romance.  <br />I believe Mr. Smolens could really write a good descriptive story if he didn't have to pepper it with four letter words and sleazy situations.  I'm not clear as to whether this is his own idea or something his publishers believe will sell books.  In either case, this tactic sold one book, but will not sell any more to me.	2004-07-17

This line has caused me to reflect on several of my birthdays and to realize that with each passing year they become less and less of an event.<br />Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park who thought his life had no meaning and that he made no impact on anybody. Five people appear to Eddie immediately after his death and prove him wrong. <br />After reading this book, I began to wonder what five people I would meet in Heaven (or wherever I end up). Perhaps a co-worker I don't really care for, perhaps a best friend from years past, or the person I accidentally cut off in traffic this morning. <br />This book has caused me to re-examine my daily interactions with people and to wonder how those interations have impacted both of us. Have I made a difference in anybody's life without even knowing it? Do the people who made a difference in my life know they did?	2003-10-30

I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind&quot;, probably because I was raised in a rural area and could relate to some of the characters and their situations.  I was really expecting to enjoy this book as much, but it was a bit disappointing.  <br />When Hazel Marie doesn't come home from a date, Miss Julia begins to panic and sets out to find her.  With some help from Little Lloyd (who has grown up quite a bit from the first book) Hazel Marie is located and returned home.  This happens about halfway through the book, so I was forced to wonder what the rest of the book would be about.  Just as I suspected, it seemed to be mostly filler.  <br />The first half of the book is great-- the characters from the first book return in all their splendor and we meet a few new characters.  However, the second half of the book was disappointing and on several occasions I wondered where it was going or even why some of the plot was included.<br />All in all, I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books and intend to read the third one.  I just hope it's more like the first one than the second one.	2002-05-25

Maybe the plot was a bit thin and predictable, but Grisham's writing style is so smooth and easy to read that I was able to consume this book in two sittings.  It was like I was able to sit down and visit with an old friend.  Perhaps some other readers confused this familiarity with boredom.  <br />It all starts when law professor Ray Atlee and his prodigal brother, Forrest, are summoned home by their ailing father to settle his estate.  But, by the time Ray arrives, his father is already dead.  The will is simple enough: the estate is to be divided equally between the two sons.  However, Ray discovers something he hadn't planned on-- $3 million in cash stashed in the father's house.  It turns out that Ray isn't the only one who knows about this fortune; someone else is after the money and won't hesitate to remove Ray from the picture.  The remainder of the book is devoted to investigating the source of the cash and trying to discover who the other party is that wants it.  <br />Some better proofreading would have made this an easier book to read since there are some glaring errors that should have been caught.  But, all in all, an enjoyable, suspensful book.  I will continue reading Grisham.	2002-02-25

I read one review stating that the title of this book should have been &quot;Watching Paint Dry&quot;.  While it's not as exciting and riveting as Grisham's other works, and it took me about six chapters to get into the story, it was still an enjoyable book.<br />Set in 1952 Arkansas, 7-year-old Luke Chandler is forced to grow up quickly when he becomes exposed to several adult situations.  It seems as though everyone in the story has a secret to keep and they all manage to confide in Luke.  <br />The yearly ritual of hiring &quot;Hill People&quot; and Mexican aliens as temporary laborers on their cotton farm turns out to be a dangerous proposition this year.  Luke is not pleased when the hill people set up camp in the front yard, right in the middle of his baseball diamond, but is even less pleased when one of them turns out to be a bully and is involved in a fatal fight in town one Saturday.  Luke was unfortunate enough to be a witness and is torn between telling the truth or incurring the bully's wrath.<br />Luke also witnesses a brutal murder and the birth of an illegitimate baby, both turn out to be secrets he keeps and issues that cause him to wrestle with right vs. wrong.  Throw in a schoolboy crush on a girl 10 years his senior and the constant worry about how the weather will affect the cotton crop this year, and you get a story with several different situations and angles.  <br />Grisham's writing style is easy to read and very descriptive.  Even though the plot didn't move too quickly, I still enjoyed this book and will continue reading Grisham's work.	2002-01-10

I picked up the first Harry Potter book to see what all the fuss and media hype was about.  Now, I'm hooked.  I had to read the second book and now I'm searching for the third.<br />Harry returns to Hogwarts against the advice of a mysterious visitor, only to find that life there is not the same as it was his first year.  There's an egotistical new professor on the faculty, mysterious attacks against Muggle-born students, and a new ghost that haunts the girls' bathroom.  Harry and his cohorts must get to the bottom of the mystery and, in the process, discover the real reason Hagrid was expelled.<br />These books are not just for kids.  They're for anyone who enjoys a light, fast read with a little injection of mystery.<br />As for those critics who insist that the books are about the occult, that's nonsense.  I grew up watching &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and these books are as &quot;evil&quot; as these television programs.  The plot is the classic &quot;good vs. evil&quot; with a magical twist and a young, likeable hero.	2001-11-30

I picked up this &quot;kid's book&quot; just to see what all the fuss was about.  Since I haven't enjoyed fantasy-type books in the past, I wasn't expecting much, but at least I would be able to relate to all the media hype.<br />To my surprise, I actually enjoyed reading this book and couldn't wait to finish it.  Parts of the plot were predictible, but the ending was a surprise to me-- maybe because I hadn't put much thought into it.<br />I found this book to be a fast, enjoyable read and a great way to wind down the day.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series and to seeing the movie.	2001-11-25

Some are hilarious, others are more mundane, and some just leave you wondering why they're included in the book.  All of them, however, contain a slightly slanted viewpoint about everyday occurences in the life of the author.  I enjoyed most of the essays, but some include some rather crude language.<br />This book was great for my busy schedule.

We also meet several local characters, from the Preacher with ulterior motives to the town gossips, and watch as the always proper Miss Julia begins to assert herself and speak her mind on several matters.<br />This book is a quick, entertaining read that will make you laugh out loud more than once.

Since I had this same sentiment about turning 30, I decided to give this book a read and see if I could relate to anything else in it.<br />I found that the five friends in this book had actually accomplished quite a bit by their 30th birthdays and shouldn't be complaining.  However, we are our own worst critics and at some time during our 30's, we start looking back instead of forward.  This book taught me to look forward and try to improve my current situation rather than looking back and whining about how good the good old days were.<br />This book is a predictable no-brainer, but it was still fun to read.  The references to the 80's were also fun and brought back some memories for me.	2001-07-30

The chapters about your individual personality type were interesting, but didn't really tell me anything about myself that I didn't already know.<br />This book should be recommended to high school seniors about to enter college and pursue a course of education.  This is the point of my life where this book would have been the most helpful, not as a thirty-something who is unhappy in his career choice.  <br />It would have been helpful to me if the authors had included a section about the training necessary for the careers they discuss, or at least a reference to where we could get this information.  Now that I know what I should be, how do I get there?	2001-05-17

It took me a few chapters to get into this book and get used to Martini's writing style, but once I did I couldn't put it down!<br />Armando Acosta is a judge disliked by nearly everyone-- especially the corrupt police officers who are the subject of a grand jury investigation conducted by Acosta.  Acosta is arrested on a phony charge of solicitation and is suspended from the bench.  However, when the decoy in the arrest turns up dead, it looks as though Acosta will be vacating the bench permanently.  <br />Acosta enlists the help of one of his least favorite attorneys, Paul Madriani, to help him beat the murder charge.  In defending the judge, Madriani discovers that the corrupt officers will stop at nothing to protect themselves and their peers.<br />Madriani suspects that the prosecution's case is missing one vital piece of evidence.  His search for that missing piece leads him to the murderer and the motive in a surprise twist ending.  <br />This is my first Martini book, but it certainly won't be my last.  The TV movie was good, but not as riveting as the book.  Martini's material is good enough for the big screen and I wonder why some Hollywood producer hasn't discovered this author.	2001-05-07

Some reviewers thought the plot was too thin and that the characters weren't adequately developed, etc., etc.  However, I read for entertainment and relaxation so an elaborate plot and complex characters aren't necessary for me.  <br />Yes, I was able to figure out the plot early into the book, but it was still interesting to see how it unfolded.  As for those who fail to find a protagonist/antagonist relationship, I think the author left it up to the reader to decide who the protagonist is-- there could be a different one for each reader, depending on your background and personal values.  <br />Grisham's writing style (at least in this book) is easy-to-read, entertaining, and lacking the profanity that so many authors think is necessary in order to tell a story.  This book is good for a quick, entertaining read and I enjoyed it very much.	2001-04-16

He was just another mixed-up bratty kid who seemed destined to waste his life.  After finishing the book, I'm hoping for a sequal.  <br />Evan grows up emotionally right before our eyes and, through several experiences, becomes comfortable with himself and learns to stand on his own.

While this one is not his best, it it still a far better effort than we see from other authors.<br />This book contains the familiar comforts we have come to expect from Francis-- a likeable accidental hero, a loathsome villan or two, a nice girl and the chance to learn something.  Reading one of Francis' novels is like sitting down with an old, familiar friend.  We know what to expect, and I think this lack of surprise is why so many reviewers have panned this book.  It is exactly the reason I bought it.  I knew what I would be in for and I didn't have to wonder if I had just wasted $20 and killed a few trees for nothing.<br />I have heard rumors that this may be Francis' last book.  While I understand his desire to retire, I will miss the yearly visit with my old friend.  But then, I have 40 other chances to become reacquainted with him.<br />Dick Francis at his worst is still better than other authors at their best!	2000-11-27

Although they do exist in this book, they are not quite as predominent as in other works.  <br />However, this story deals with two men who cannot put their pasts behind them and embark in a healthy relationship.  The term &quot;Nightswimmer&quot; becomes a metaphor for issues that the characters cannot put behind them and, although we all have our own &quot;Nightswimmers&quot;, the trick is to get beyond them and find happiness, not dwell on the past.      The story is written as though the author is speaking to the other main character in the book, a very interesting and almost haunting effect.<br />I would, in the future, like to see a book about well-adjusted men without emotional baggage carrying on a healthy &quot;normal&quot; domestic partnership-- but then that's not much of a story, is it?	2000-11-20

It turned out that I couldn't wait for my meetings to end so I could go back to my room and read!<br />I was born at about the time the second story takes place and was raised in a college town, so I remember the tail end of the Viet Nam War era and the college demonstrations.  I was too young to experience the whole era and, consequently, there were parts of the book I didn't understand, but I can recommend it highly nonetheless.  <br />It was interesting how he carried the characters through the book and showed us how they were changed throughout their life experiences.
