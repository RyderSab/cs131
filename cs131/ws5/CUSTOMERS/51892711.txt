It's important to understand that this information is coming from a record executive and that his view point (typical of most record execs) is to favor what will make him the most money at the moment. All of his advise is slanted that direction, don't misunderstand this is excellent advise if you want to be a flavor of the year pop-star, this is what his taste is for , disposable &quot;artist&quot; that he can control of. If you were to make it to the top with the help of Mr. Cowell or any other executive like him you'd find yourself his puppet, his special guest at the top with an short expiration date. Pop music dominates the Top40 charts but the career lifespan is four to five years at the top, then you're yesterday's news. Mr. Cowell wouldn't argue this fact, but he'd much rather avoid that subject altogether, after all the pop kings and queens he manufactures get a chance to be a star for a little while, they are paid well for their short stay (well depending on what you consider fiar) and during their entire stay they are tightly controlled by the executives and the managers under them who select the songs, select the art and style direction, you see it's more of a hobby for Cowell and fresh young talet are just his clay. <br />Now if you want real advice to take your band to the top and to stay there a long time. If you are more than a pretty face with a voice and you actually write your own music and view yourself as an artist, then stay clear of this book, instead pick up a copy of Donald Passman's - All That You Need to know about the Music Business.	2004-01-07

Sams Kick Start series boast being &quot;quick, concise&quot; and &quot;practical&quot; those words adequately describe this book, I have read five other books on the subject of DirectX programming and Managed DirectX 9 Graphics and Game Programming is a unique gem, it is an excellent introduction to the Direct3D, DirectPlay and DirectSound APIs. It effectively covers the fundamentals and fills the gaps left by the Managed DirectX9 SDK Sample applications. Beyond the fundamentals Tom's explanations are very focused, for example, the Direct3D API is much too large for one book to cover and he does an outstanding job of providing the least amount of information you need to know in order to build a 3D game program, this was precisely what I was hoping for when I bought this book.<br />Microsoft recently reviled that in the next version of Windows they will replace the Win32 API with the .NET Framework Class Libraries as the OS building blocks. This shift along with the rise of 64-bit processors will push Managed code to the forefront. If you're thinking of making the switch this book would make a good companion to a .NET fundamentals book, it would help make the experience more enjoyable and would provide a real-world example of how writing Managed code is in many regards much simpler than Unmanaged. One word of caution, you must have C# or VB.NET experience to get anything from this book. It makes extensive use of the .NET Framework class libraries, also you'll need Visual Studio.NET 2003 edition to open the sample files (the pervious version of Visual Studio.NET is incompatible with the solution files) although the full Framework SDK is included with command line tools to achieve the task, no make files are included. So if you do not have Visual Studio.NET hopefully you understand how to build and link your source code using the command line tools, again if you're new to .NET/Managed code, this isn't the place to start.	2003-11-24

The book is a good effort to chronicle the careers and lives of John Romero and John Carmack and their rise and fall in the game industry. At times it reads fairly well, we get a few good stories and history on what went into those first first-person shooters that \\"transformed pop culture\\". The book starts when Romero and Carmack are in high school and ends in modern time (with Doom III nearing completion and Monkeystone games formed) But there are quite a few problems I had with this book. First, it's often hisotrically wrong! Two key examples of this are when Kushner writes \\"...Carmacked uploaded GLQuake, he had ported the code over a weekend\\". Another part of the book address the controversial \\"Suck it down\\" add that Romereo's Ion Storm ran to promote their flagship title Diakatana. Kushner (for whatever reason) tries to remove all blame from Romero for the add, when I know from a few sources Romereo was to blame almost entirely for the ad. These are just two key things I can point, there are likely many more inconsistancies that I don't know, but it's enough that the author's integrity must be questioned. My other problem is with Kushner's writing, he's not that good with character development, and while this is nonfiction, the only three people in the book I could visuallize were Romero, Carmack and Stevie Case. No physical attributes of the others were detailed. Kushner also goes off into the background of just about every other major and minor character intoduced in a dull predictable backstory that spans from half a page to two pages. Dull irrelevant facts about insignifigant characters that does little to support the rest of the book. Near the end, the book just kind of goes to mush as Kushner fails to bring any kind of close to the story he's trying to present. It's a if there isn't a real focus, yet every page seems to scream \\"someone turn this into a script\\", we can only hope that doesn't happen. Lastly, I was upset by the way Kushner tries to paint a balanced picture between the pitfalls of Romero and Carmack, he tries to bring them both down to even ground as having made some mistakes, but both being equals. The reality is that Carmack was the good guy though most all of the problems, Romero brought on most of his own pain and really destroyed what Id had. Kushner points out that Carmack did not want to fire Romero, but he had no choice, but he fails to point out that Romero's absense caused a lot of Ids problems there after and had a direct negative impact on Carmack. The demise of Id (that really never happend, thanks to Carmack and others) was much to the blame of Romero and his childish ways. He should have been painted as a bad guy, but Kushner just couldn't go there.lanced picture between the pitfalls of Romero and Carmack, he tries to bring them both down to even ground as having made some mistakes, but both being equals.

Hulk tells his story and tells it so well I couldn't put the book down. If you were a fan in your childhood, it's quite an experience to relive some of those moments though the eyes of your once immortal hero, who know seems... normal. Hulk holds little back as he descibes what it took to get Wrestling to the point it is today. Getting his perspective on his greatist matches and what really went on when the cameras are off makes a convincing case that it's not all fake and the politics that never surface sometimes aren't too far fetched from the fabricated storylines they sell to the public.     Although wrestling isn't a form of entertainment I can say I've enjoyed in years, I did want to find out a bit about this guy who was important to me as a kid, and this book did a great job with that.	2002-12-14

Many people want Elvis to be alive, and while I'm not 100% sure he's really dead and I am almost 100% sure the story of Elvis's faked death as presented in this book is false. <br />Dr. Hinton paints a picture of a man he believes (but can not prove) is Elvis. Read and judge for yourself, it's hard not to raise questions when you learn going in that Dr. Hinton has always believed Elvis may have faked his death. The book is carefully written to keep Dr. Hinton from presenting himself as a quack. He believes this Jesse is Elvis based on his indirect communications with him. This approach gives Dr. Hinton a sure escape, he doesn't claim Jesse IS Elvis by fact, he only clams to believe Jesse is Elvis by his own faith in the loose evidence he has seen... had I known that going in, I would have saved my money.	2002-10-31

I have read the server control book by Wrox press and thought it was nice and to-the-point on a lot of issues. In contrast, this book is less of a reference and more of a cover-to-cover read. <br />I don't care much for the format of the book (it's rather hard to use as a reference), but if you're willing to take the time to read it though, you'll find a wealth of information on the subject, written by two authors who know their subject inside out.	2002-09-29

This is one of the few tech books I have returned. While it is well written (aside from poor editing in a few spots) this book wasn't what I was looking for, if you have Professional ASP.NET or ASP.NET Unleashed this book is going to pale in comparison, and you have absolutely no reason to waste your money here.<br />If you are an experienced VB6 or classic ASP developer new to ASP.NET and ADO.NET and you want to get up to speed quickly with a bit of hand holding along the way, this may be the perfect book for you. Unlike the other two books I mentioned, this one is packed with screen shots and touches more on Visual Studio.NET (although VS.NET isn't required to make use of the content).<br />Bottomline, this is a beginners book. I exchanged my copy for Microsoft ADO.NET core reference and found exactly what I was looking for in that title.	2002-09-24

For the price you may expect twice the book (a tad over 400 pages is small in tech books terms), but don't be fooled, the content of this book is very rich and much of it is hard to come by otherwise. Unless you enjoy spending hours digging though the msdn and Microsoft newsgroups, this book is for you!<br />As with many of the newer Wrox titles, this one is organized more like a collection of articles. This format has been the cause of many bad reviews, and while I don't care for the article approach most of the time, on Pro ASP.NET Server Controls... it works quite well. I bought the book with a specific task in mind, I needed to create a unique custom control that had multiple child controls inside of it, my only previous knowledge of server controls was what I had from the Professional ASP.NET book (which equates to about a chapter of this book) the material found in the Pro ASP.NET book left me with more questions than answers and I needed something to help me really understand what goes on inside and out of a web server control and how to integrate properly with the .NET Framework, with this book I achieved that goal within three hours of reading and experimenting, it truely was a life saver for helping meet one of our milestones.<br />So why only four stars? Well, as others have pointed out, the book isn't perfect, I did have to use the VS.NET on-line help to lookup how to generate client-side script for postback events, better examples could have been provided, but overall it's very good.	2002-07-19

The author is very good, you can tell he knows 3ds max and loves to share what he knows. I really like the layout of the book and the concept of making the entire book a tutorial on how to build the cover image, I didn't give it five stars, because I wish it had more illustrations (this is not likely the authors fault, but more so the publisher) a book like this MUST have color illustrations and lots of them.<br />Before you buy this (or any other intro book on 3ds max) please go to your help menu and select &quot;Tutorials&quot; you will be deligted by what you find. The nice folks at descret and packaged in an excellent set of tutorials that will actually bring you from biginner to intermediate level faster than this book and the tutorials cover character modeling and animation!

Books	1	3	11	N	N	Oh no, the author isn't biased	Near the very beginning of this book the author makes a few claims that he wouldn't take an anti-Microsoft stance. As you read it's impossible not to detect his bias all over this text.<br />The facts are simple, Linux is an alternative to Windows; but it's not for everyone. It's not near as easy to configure. Try to configure special audio hardware, or worse yet a cable modem connection and you're looking at a few days worth of reading, tinkering and troubleshooting something that would likely only take a hour or two (at most) on Windows. This is only one case of many where your average user just shouldn't have to deal with the innconviences of Linux. Does it make since for a superuser or Linux developer, absolutely! Does it make since for the business that wants to cut cost by putting a free OS on their desktops and servers, absolutely! Does it make since to the average home user..... Absolutely NOT!<br />The Linux community loves their product, and most of them HATE Microsoft and ANYTHING Microsoft produces, after trying Linux and tinkering with it for a few days, I'm not blown away at all. I see it's usefulness, but keeping things in perspective I also see Windows usefulness. regardless you SHOULD NOT use the book as a tool for helping you decide.	2001-12-09

Unlike many of the other &quot;beginner&quot; books on DirectX (take Windows Game Programming for Dummies as an example). This book does make a great effort to attempt to cover all aspects of DirectX, and devotes much of it's text to Direct3D. Nost books only cover select topics, most are broken up to: DirectDraw, DirectSound and DirectPlay.. or just Direct3D, this book attempts to do all this in 24 hours.<br />The 24 hour bit can be a bit misunderstood. One can take it to mean a cover to cover read knowing nothing about topic or related topics in 24 hours (and this is very unrealistic) or one can assume the total reading time of the book will be 24 hours, this doesn't account for personal research and experimenting on the topics discussed.<br />The book does only touch on many of it's topics, it could not be part of the &quot;24 hour&quot; book series if it did not, and you can read this book in 24 hours, providing you also add in at least 4 hours of further research (though the DirectX SDK documentation and samples) and personal experimenting for each hour of read time, you CAN walk away learning quite a bit.<br />Learning DirectX takes effort and hard work, if you want a hand-holding book the ..for Dummies book I mention above is fantastic, if you want a good over-view of DirectX 7 that assumes you know what a computer is, what a compiler is, how to program in C++, etc... get this or some other more specialized book on DirectDraw or Direct3D.<br />Only 3 stars because there are some errors in the text and samples and it can be a bit misleading as most readers of the &quot;24 hour&quot; books may be expecting something a lot more stright-forward.	2001-11-27

Back on the author line-up is David Susman and Alex Homer (probably the best two authors at Wrox). So, here you get an intro to the .NET Framework, intro to ASP.NET, and then a lot of useful information that's intended more for look-up reference than a cover to cover read.<br />The book is still a bit rough, the authors do the very best they can to uncover every stone, but I believe lack of .NET experience will shine though when the second edition is released (which hopefully won't be till .NET 2.0 arrives in a few years).  At any rate, if you want ASP.NET knowledge, this is your best one-stop shop. <br />My only (other) small compliants are: 1. The book tries to cross beginner, intermediate and advanced plans all at once. I really wonder where the Beginning ASP.NET book (already scheduled for print) will fit in.  2. Unfortunately since ASP.NET has all the power of compiled C#, VB.NET or any language in the .NET platform; one book simply can't cover all the features of the class libraries. As a result this book isn't to ASP.NET what Professional ASP 3.0 is to ASP 3.0, It would simply be impossible to create a book that contained that much information in a single volume.	2001-08-16

The topic seems unapproachable because of the learning curve involved.<br />The reality is, this stuff is very complex; however, in the hands of a good author or teacher the subject can be broken down into consumable portions and taught to even the most novice developer. I've tried three other books on this subject...none of them come close to this text! In fact, this book not only flows well, it almost acts as three books in one, first coving C++ (in depth, all though Win32 console based applications), then it approaches user interface using the MFC, next database development using ODBC, and lastly it devotes a chapter to ATL/COM development (which is far better written than the entire Beginning ATL COM 3.0 book by Wrox).<br />If you want to learn Visual C++, youc can do it!

For the price you may be tempted to look to other books; I would urge you not to. After a in depth read of the first three chapters and a quick scan of the remaining chapters I feel this author is very capable of providing condensed information for the intermediate-advanced level developer. Any more than 300 pages would require unneeded &quot;fluff&quot; thrown in to attempt to make the book more useful to everyone, and would only frustrate the intermediate-advanced developer who's time is valuable.<br />For my needs this book was perfect. It povided very detailed information on XSL and explained how XSL relates to XSLT and XPath, it also explained XQL. If you pick up a general XML book you usually will only find one or two chapters (two at best) discussing XSL. This book is intended as a companion to a general XML book (XML For Dummies, or this authors own XML Companion come to mind) this book assumes you know what XML is, what a DTD is, etc...<br />I have searched for a book to teach XSL to perform complex filtering and grouping in the output, prior to reading this book I had read: XML for dummies (IDG Press) and Professional ASP XML (Wrox Press), this book goes into much better detail and is a pefect companion to both of the books listed above.<br />The authors writting style is excellent, he provides many short examples of input/processing and output code in each chapter. He does not hold your hand and many of his descriptions have to be read a few times to fully grasp (XSL isn't as simple as you may think). Overall I feel very comfortable in saying this is the best book (and one of the only books) on the market to fully explain current XSL standards.	2000-12-30

A book based upon beta technology didn't appeal to me at first and honestly it made me a bit upset that my favorite publisher of technical books (Wrox press) would put something like this  out....<br />After reading though the first three chapters and skiming the  rest of the book I can tell you this title lives up to the standards of  Wrox press, it provides an excellent intorduction to this new technology  and explains why we as ASP deveopers need to know about ASP+ now.<br />Here  are some facts for you:<br />- Wrox didn't write this alone, Microsoft came to  them asking them to write it, knowing Wrox's quality; Microsoft worked with  the authors at Wrox to help create this book, because they want to prepare  us for the changes coming.<br />- This book was handed out at the Microsoft  Professional Developers Conference in Orlando (early July 2000) along with  the first tech preview of ASP+ &amp; Visual Studio .NET, apparently  Microsoft wanted to provide the attendies with some solid documentation on  this tech preview and that was probably behind (at least it part) this  books coming into existance at the time it did.<br />- This book covers ASP+  and not Visual Studio .NET. The two are tightly connected (as the book  explans), but you will most likely not need Visual Studio .NET to code for  ASP+ (just as you do not need Visual InterDev to code ASP). Visual Studio  .NET is discussed, but it is not the primary focus of discussion and all  the sample apps could just as easily be developed in Notepad.<br />- ASP+ is  part of NGWS runtime (read the book to find out what this is) which will  most likely first arrive in an upcomming service pack (or possibly option  pack) for Windows 2000. This will most likely happen prior to the release  of Visual Studio .NET, so the contents of this book may be useful a lot  sooner than you think.	2000-07-29
US	51892711	R1JX8HKSF1AR87	1565924460	708964364	Developing ASP Components	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Excellent book on the topic	I have Professional ASP (Wrox) and was looking for a book to go in depth into the theory, design and implementation of COM objects for ASP.<br />This is the book I went with and I'm very satisfied with the way this book is  written and the material it covers. The author does an excellent job at  explaining things like: <br />* The advantages a VC++ COM developer may have  over a VB COM developer. <br />* The ScriptingContext and the ObjectContext  objects that can you instance, why one is right for any development using  Transact Server and why.<br />* Equal coverage of COM development using  VB,  VC++ and Java.<br />Only four stars because I would have liked a few more  illustrations and a CD-ROM or at least some source code I could download  would have been nice.<br />Do not get this book if you are a beginner to  VB/ASP, you need to get some fundimentals down before you go here.	2000-07-06

Definately not a  good reference book unless you intend to go though the entire text.	1999-11-09

This new breed of OpenGL developers are looking for a good  place to start. The Offical Guide to Learning OpenGL (also refered to as  &quot;the redbook&quot;) is that starting place.<br />Mason Woo and the OpenGL  Review Board, along with other contributors walk the reader though well  thought out example programs and explain in detail each OpenGL function  call. The chapters are well organized, and authors take a complete platform  independate approach to OpenGL. An excellent choice for a college text book  on the subject of real-time 3D graphic programming.<br />The only other book  to be considered is the  OpenGL SuperBible, but it's poorly organized in  comparison and focuses only on the Win32 platform. This book should only be  considered if the reader is new to programming and needs to be walked  though setting up the development enviroment (such reads should consider  going back and learning more about their IDE before venturing into OpenGL  programming anyway)<br />For overall content, reference and presentation the  OpenGL Programming Guide is the best book I've read covering any API.	1999-03-15

This was the second book I bought on programming using Microsoft's DirectX SDK. I researched all the other books on the market before I bought it, and by reading this book I learned everything I needed to know about  DirectDraw, DirectInput, DirectSound &amp; DirectPlay<br />This book provides  many example games, after reading this book you'll have a better  understanding of 2d game engines like those found in Rayman, Myst and  Command &amp; Conquer.<br />Another big plus is the author's explaination on  how to use Binary Search Trees and Linked List and the sample code provided  on how to apply these to creating/destoying objects/entities in games.<br />If  you want to learn how to program games for Windows using DirectX you either  go with this book or Andre LaMothe's Windows Game Programming for  Dummies.<br />Go with the later if you're a complete newbie. Or (better yet),  buy them both.	1999-03-06

They share a lot of good information.<br />If you're fooling around with a WYSIWYG editor like FrontPage or DreamWeaver and want to know  how to cross over to professional layout design, you'll really enjoy this  book. <br />This book isn't for someone just getting into web development, it  focuses mostly on the layout aspects, and designs. Every page is full of  color photo examples, and bios + development tool list are given for each  of the 14 article authors.	1999-02-20

At this point you'll have a hard time compiling any of the source example as they are designed for Borland C++/Visual C++ 1.0 (DOS  version). <br />The thing that saves this book is the wealth of infomation  building your own 3D engine. I haven't seen another book come close. Sure  you could go out and by books that specialize on key areas, but this book  is still the only &quot;one stop shop&quot; kind'a deal for 3D engine  design.<br />You'll need to be at advanced level when you get this book, cause  unless you're still running MS-DOS and have an old 16-bit DOS C/C++  compiler, you're going to have to port the code to Win32 &amp; DirectDraw.  <br />I'd recommend reading this author's new book &quot;Windows Game  Programming for Dummies&quot; and then buying this book and attempting to  port the code to Win32/DirectDraw. <br />One can only hope that Mr. LaMothe  will bring us an updated version with source examples using Direct3D  Immediate Mode or OpenGL.	1999-02-20

If you want to  get the edge on ASP fast, buy this book and read it.	1999-02-20
