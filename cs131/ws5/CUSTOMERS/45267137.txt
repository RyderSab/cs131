As someone who also moved many times as a child, and was often forced to care for younger siblings, I can fully relate to Tamara's feelings. It wasn't until I became a mother myself that I was able to gain some perspective and understand that most parents do what they are able to do in often impossible circumstances. You'll love this book and all of its humor, wit, style, and yes, tragedy. Take the time to read it. This tale will be one thing that stays.	2003-11-21

In this book of two wildly different women, it is really the maternal bond that takes center stage. Barely out of childhood herself, Opal still instinctively values, cares for and clings to her son. Rose was a model mother, but now clings to her grief as the only link left to her teenage son, killed in a tragic accident. As the story unfolds, it's hard to put down, just from the sheer weight of the emotion it evokes. Good writing is in the details and this book is filled with those subtle touches that speak to every mother's heart -- the smell of a newly bathed baby, the joy of watching a sleeping child, the tension of fear/anticipation that accompanies each step in their outward journey away from you. As the author of a book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I ached with Rose at her unimaginable loss and triumphed with Opal as she tried to make a new life for herself and her son. This book is endearing and enduring. It helps us to see one another with love and caring, not with the labels neatly sewn onto all of us by society. In this way, a young, unwed mother and an older, bereaved mother can find that common ground where love and caring forge new friendships, new life and new hope.	2001-06-25

Faustina Kowalska	Books	5	12	16	N	N	Saintly Struggles are Divine Revelation	I've just returned from a visit to the church and  convent where Sister Faustina lived in Krakow, Poland, and couldn't wait to read her diaries. They are so revealing; not just about her inner struggles but also the message of repentance and mercy that Jesus Christ offers our needy world. As the author of an  inspirational book for mothers, NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I put spirituality at the top of my priority list. But I am humbled and inspired by the depth and passion of Sister Faustina's devotion and faith. Despite her struggles with doubt and anxiety, she remains faithful to her visions of the Divine Mercy. And look what has been accomplished through this young and humble nun. The world has renewed hope. The Church  has a new saint. And all of us have these incredible diaries to read and re-read as we follow our own unique faith journeys. Thank you, God, for the gift of your faithful servant, Saint Faustina, and her diligent efforts to record her most solemn and intimate moments with Your Beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.	2001-06-19
