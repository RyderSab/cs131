I know it is \\"old\\" but it is relevant to today's Christian. I first read it by having it lent to me from my Pastor this year (2005). I  endeavor to study the Lord's life in the Bible to be like Him, and then reading this book, I see others study Him  in order to learn and grow to be more like Him. This is an interesting book, 150 pages of reading with 7 of scripture references in the back. It shows step by step, how Jesus did His Father's will in very clear enlightened words. It made me think and ponder on Jesus' ways. A fast read yet one I am compelled to read again and take notes. If you are desiring to study Jesus, this book would be most helpful to you. And all this for under $5 with shipping! Excellent! (the copy i bought was $1.41)	2005-06-16

I liked it so well I gave one to my girlfriend who is in a serious relationship leading to marriage, so they could read and discuss the issues and get ready for marriage. (besides Christian marriage counseling). Now I see you can pick one up VERY cheaply, so that is a bargain for you. No, I don't know the author, just enjoyed the book.	2004-04-02

True, the photo of the finished product was black and white, and not that useful, but the instructions were fine. I was glad the floss was included so we didn't have to run out and buy more right at first. This is a good activity for a parent and child to do together.	2003-12-11

The review below mine, bashing fundelmentalists, confused me, because we do teach the trinity, and how the Old and New Testaments work together. I got this book for the word studies. I may or may not agree with the short part of the book (like on cremation). The word studies are the bulk of this book and I get a lot of use out of it.	2003-08-14

This is a good book. If you don't agree with the literature, don't bad mouth it, if you are secure in your faith you won't be upset with those of us who are also secure &amp; must deal with the door to door religious people who insist on talking to me.

When I see a &quot;bad mouthing&quot; of this type of book, I feel sorry for the angry individual.

Small, but packed with hands on Scripture to read & answers a beginners questions well. Highly recommended. I ordered 12 but shipping was expensive as they go by item not by weight, that was a shock but booklet still worth it to give to new Christians I encounter, to encourage them in their walk with the Lord. It has more of a Assembly of God bent, not Baptist, though I am the latter. BUT 99% of it was excellent so I recommend it.	2002-07-24
